LONDON, Printed by R.Y. for Nicolas Bourne, at the South entrance of the
royal Exchange, An. Dom. 1636.

TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY, CHARLES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, KING OF
GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND IRELAND, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH.
Most gracious and dread Sovereign,
I Would not presume to present these crude conceptions and expressions to your
Highness, if I had not offered them before to an higher Majesty: in whose
Courts, with how much the more fear and trembling I delivered them, so much
the greater hope I conceive of your Majesty's gracious acceptance. The Texts of
Scriptures here expounded are all select, and most of them mystical; in the
declaration whereof, if my observations second not your Majesty's thoughts, yet
I persuade my self they will occasion more divine raptures in your royal
heart. The Crocodiles which besiege the banks of Nilus, and way-lay those that
travel into Egypt, Caussinus parab. hist. l. 8. c. 31. Compertum est
Crocodilum improbissimum animal, si penna Ibidis defricetur, adeo obtorpescere
and debilitari, ut immobilis reddatur.
if they be rubbed, or but pricked with the quill of the Ibis, are so weakened
and stupefied thereby, that they cannot stir: and in like manner experience
teaches, that the presentest remedies against those venomous Serpents which
infest the Church of Christ, whether Heretics or Schismatickes, are the pens
of Orthodoxe Writers. For that which is spoken comes but to a few that are
within hearing, and stays not by them; but that which is written, and much
more that which is printed, presents it self to the view of all, and is
always ready at hand: and as it receives, so it makes an impression. Which
consideration, among others, induced me to give way to the desires of some
friends, for the bringing of these illustrations of darker places of Scripture
to light, especially because therein the proper Heresies of these times are
encountered, and the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England maintained
by the Oracles of God, and the joint testimony of prime Antiquity. In this
Work I own nothing but the labor of many months, nay rather years, in
culling choice of flowers out of many hundreds of gardens, and platting them
into a garland for Christ his Spouse. From which I humbly beseech Almighty God,
that your Majesty, and all that touch any leaf thereof, may smell a savor of
life unto life. The price and worth in all things makes not the dedication;
but in some the dedication makes the price: Plin. praef. not. hist.
Multa in pretio habentur, quia sacris dicata. And if there appear in these
unpolished lines any luster, it is no other than that they receive from the
beams of your Majesty's eye, if your Majesty vouchsafe a glaunce thereof on
them: for which (as we are all otherwise most bound) I shall ever fix my eyes
and devotions on Heaven, and uncessantly pray for the continuance and increase
of your Majesty's temporal, and assurance of eternal happiness.

Your Majesty's most loyally and humbly devoted Subject, DANIEL FEATLEY.

THE BRUISED REED. A Sermon preached before his Grace, and the rest of his
Majesty's Commissioners in causes Ecclesiastical, December. 4. An. Dom. 1617. at
Lambeth. THE FIRST SERMON.
MATTHEW. 12. and 20. ex ESA. 42. and 3. A bruised reed shall he not break, and
smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory,
or (as we read in Esaias) he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.


Most REVEREND, etc.
I Would not presume to found a bruised Reed, or wind a cracked Pipe in this
place, destinated and appointed for the silver Trumpets of Sion; nor blow my
smoking Flax here, where the cleerest Lights of the Sanctuary usually shine,
if the Text of Scripture, even now read in your ears, encouraged me not
thereunto, teaching the strongest and tallest Cedars of Lebanon, by the example
of the Highest, not to fall upon, and break the bruised Reed: and likewise the
brightest burning Lamps of the Church not to do ut, and quench the smoking,
or (as the Hebrew bears it) the dimly burning Flax of their brethrens
obscurer parts and labors. A bruised Reed, etc.

Whether by bruised Reed, with S. Gregory, we understand the broken Scepter of
the Jewish Kingdom; and by smoking Flax, the Aaronicall Priesthood,
destitute of the light of Faith, and now ready to go out and expire; or by
Arundinem conquassatam, the shaken Reed (as S. Hierome reads the words) we
conceive the wavering faith of the Jews to be meant; and by the smoking
Flax, the momentary fervor of the Gentiles, which is Tertullians exposition,
seconded by Rhemigius: or we take the bruised Reeds in Saint Hilaries
construction for the maimed bodies of such as were brought to Christ; and
smoking Flax, for their troubled minds and distressed consciences: or we be
carried with the maine current of later Interpreters, who are all strongly for
all penitent sinners oppressed with the heavy burden of their sins, and
stricken with the horror of Gods judgments, in whom there remains any spark
of grace, to be shadowed under the Metaphors of the bruised Reed and smoking
Flax.

Vox diversa sonat doctorum, est vox tamen una. The descant is somewhat
different, the ground is the same; all warbling the sweet note of our Redeemers
most gracious and merciful disposition, who was so meek in his speeches, that
he never strained his voice to exclaim bitterly, and inveigh vehemently
against any; Ver. 19. He shall not cry, nor lift up his voice: and so mild and
altogether innocent in his actions, that he never brake so much as a bruised
Reed, nor trod out a smothering Week, or smoking Flax.

To clear then the meaning of this Scripture from all mists of obscurity,
arising from variety of Interpretations, give me leave, as it were, to melt
many small wax lights into a great Taper, by a general Paraphrase upon the
words. He, that is, Jesus, the second person in Trinity, our Mediator and
Savior (as S. Matthew, by applying this Prophecy unto him, consequently
expounds it) Shall or will not break (...), that is, destroy or cast away a
bruised Reed or Cane, (...), that is, an afflicted and contrite sinner, be he
Prince or Priest, in Saint Gregory's sense; Jew or Gentile, according to
Tertullians interpretation; afflicted in body or in mind, agreeable to S.
Hilaries exposition.

And smoking flax he shall or will not quench, that is, he will not
dishearten or discourage any Puny or Novice in his School; but on the contrary
he will cherish the smallest seeds of grace, and weak beginnings in new
converts: neither will he take away his Spirit from any relapsed and
languishing Christian, exhaling bitter and dark fumes of sighs for his
sins, if there remain any light of faith in him, though never so obscure:
any heat of true zeal and devotion, though very weak, and scarce sensible.
Behold here then store and abundance of the Balm of Gilead, dropping from
this sweet Cane in my Text. A Reed; what so weak? and that bruised; what so
unprofitable? yet shall not be broken: And Flax, or the week of a lamp or
candle; what so vile? and that smoking; what so loathsome? yet shall not be
quenched. By this cursory interpretation and illustration of the words you may
easily distinguish in them, 1. Two members of this Prophetical sentence. A
bruised, etc. A smoking, etc.
2. Two subjects answerable to the two members. Reed, Flax.
3. Two attributes proper to these subjects. Bruising, Smoking.
4. Two acts suitable to these attributes. Break, Quench.

both removed from, and denied of Christ, he shall not break, he shall not
quench. Of these, by the concurrence of Gods assistance, with your patience,
now and hereafter, according to the order of the words in the original: A reed
bruised he shall not break.

A reed. Although the reed in my Text may seem hollow, and consequently empty
of matter fit for our use; yet if you please to look narrowly into it, you
shall find it like that precious staff which Brutus offered to Apollo, in the
hollow whereof much massy gold was enclosed. Cujus intus solidum autum corneo
velabatur cortice. Live. Dec. Pri. l. 2.
To open this horn or cane, that we may find the treasure hid in it, may it
please you to take notice of a fourfold Reed described in holy Scriptures: 1.
Mystical. 2. Artificial. 3. Natural. 4. Moral.


Of the Mystical you have heard already out of the Fathers. The Artificial
reed is a golden instrument to mete withal, mentioned, Ezekiel. 40.5. Apoc.
21.15. I need not speak of the Natural reed, And he that talked with me, had
a golden reed to measure the City.
it is so well known to be a watery plant, or tree, wherewith nature fenceth
the banks of rivers and brooks, placing them thick about the flagges, as it
were so many pikes in an Army about the ensigns or streamers. Plin. hist. not.
l. 16. c. 36. Calamis orientis populi bella conficiunt, calamis spicula addunt
irrevocabili hamo noxia, his armis Solemn ipsum obscurant.
The great Naturalist sets forth this plant in the richest colors of
Rhetoric, out of a kind of gratitude, as being indebted to it for his pen
and pensill, which were anciently made of canes, as now of quils. The people of
the East use reeds in their wars, of these they make deadly darts, these they
wing with feathers, and they let them fly in such abundance, that they
over-shadow the Sun. To these reeds the Prophet Esaias 19.6.
Esaias points: The reeds and flagges shall wither. But our Savior Matthew. 11.7.
evidently alludeth to a Moral reed: What went you out into the wilderness to
see? a Reed shaken with the wind? that is, a timorous and inconstant man. No,
John was no such reed, he was not light nor unstable, nor must we be, Apoc.
3.12.
if we expect one day to be made pillars in the Temple of God.

Of these four kinds of reeds, which sorteth best with the meaning of this
Scripture? the Artificial cannot be here meant; for that is a perfect straight
cane: but this a bowed or bruised. Maldon. In hunc locum adeo quiere and
attente ambulabit, ut etiamsi super arundinem jam quassatam, qua nihil
fragilius esse potest, pedem poneret, eam non confringeret.
Maldonat glaunceth at the Natural, and thus (as he imagines) hitteth the
sense: He will tread so warily and lightly, that if a bruised reed were under
his feet, he would not break it, or crush it in pieces. But St. Hieron. Per
calamum quassatum and contusum intelligit populum Jud^icum, qui antea vocalis
and sonorus lauds Deo concinebat, postea impingens in angularem lapidem,
merito appellatur calamus fractus, pertundens manum ejus qui illi voluerit
inniti.
Hierome sweetly plays upon the Mystical reed: By the shaken and bruised
reed, says he, the Evangelist understands the people of the Jews, which in
former time were sound and entire, and sweetly sounded out the praises of God;
but now falling upon the corner stone, were cracked: and therefore are fitly
termed a bruised reed, running into their hands who lean upon it.

And Gorrh. in Matthew. 12. U^ebantur exterius literali Legis observantia, sed
vacui erant interius spirituali intelligentia.
Gorrhan adds, that the Jewish people might in this also be compared to
reeds, that they stuck to the letter of the Law, and were inwardly hollow,
that is, empty of the spiritual sense and meaning. Yet the same Saint Hieron.
Qui peccatori non porrigit manum, nec portatonus fratris sui, iste calamum
quassatum confringit.
Jerome in his Commentaries upon St. Matthew, understands Reed in my Text
morally, taking it for a frail and weak man, whereof what fitter emblem can
be devised than a reed? 1. A reed hollow within, and man by nature empty and
void of all inward grace. 2. A reed apt to make a pipe to sound, or cane to
write; and man likewise fitted with a tongue to sound out, and a hand to write
his Makers praises. 3. A reed dry or unfruitful, though planted and growing by
the river side; and man dry and unfruitful in good works, though continually
watered with the dew of Gods blessings. 4. A reed ever wagging of it self, or
shaken, and man so unstable, that Plato defines him (...), a changeable
creature. 5. A reed so weak, that it yields to the least puff of wind, and
is blown down to the ground with a violent blast; and man so feeble, that he
is moved with the least blast of temptation, and if it grow more violent, is
not only shaken, but quite bowed and bruised by it, as this in my Text.

Bruised. A reed, as I have showed, is an emblem of frail man; but a bruised
reed seems to me a proper emblem of a Christian: the Motto or word you have
in John the 16. Ver. 33.
In mundo pressuram habebitis: In the world you shall have, word for word,
bruising, that is, grievances, and bruises, or pressures, some inward, some
outward, some in the body, some in the soul, some from the yoke of Tyrants,
some from the burden of your sins, Aust. Sermon. de temp.
some from the weight of Gods judgments. Whereunto S. Austin sweetly alluding,
says, The fairest and ripest grapes are pressed, that they may yield their
sweetest juice. The hint of which conceit he may seem to have taken from Saint
Cyprian: Cypr. ep. ad Mart. Vos de vinea domini pingues racemi, and jam maturi
fructibus botri pressure secularis infestatione calcatae, torcular vestium
carcere tot quente sentitis, vini vice sanguinem funditis.
Ye are goodly branches of the true Vine, hanged with clusters of ripe grapes;
secular persecution is your treading upon and pressing, your wine press is the
prison, and in stead of wine, your blood is drawn from you. The hony-combes
are pressed and bruised, to squeeze out of them the thickest honey; the ripe and
full ears are smitten and bruised with the flaile, to beat the corn out of
them: the rich Ore is beat and bruised in the stamping mils, and afterward
tried by fire, before there come of it precious and pure metal: the corn is
bruised and ground to make flower. Whereunto the blessed Martyr Hier in catal.
Christi frumentum sum, dentibus belluarum molar, ut panis mundus inveniar.
Ignatius fitly resembling the death whereby he was then to glorify God, when
he heard the hungry Lions roaring for their prey, and gaping wide to devour
him, said, I am Christ's corn, and straight-waies shall be ground with the
teeth of beasts, that I may be served in as fine manchet at his table in
heaven. When the hottest spices are bruised and brayed in the mortar, they
yield a most fragrant smell; and a box of ointment, after that it is broken,
sweetly perfumeth the whole room: Even so those prayers and meditations are
most fervent and fragrant in the nostrils of Almighty God, which rise from a
bruised spirit, and a broken and contrite heart, through inward and outward
affliction. It is the proper evil and (if I may so speak) misery of earthly
happiness, that it makes the heart fat, and dulleth and deadeth the spirits
of zeal and devotion: and contrariwise, it is a kind of happiness which
misery brings, Hos. 5.15. In their affliction they will seek me early.
that it quickens us, and makes us seek diligently after God.

In their affliction they will seek me Or early, Hos. 5.15.
diligently. When by any grievous fit of sickness, or great loss, or sore
wound in our reputation, we are touched to the quick, then we begin to be
sensible of our own infirmities, and compassionate of other men's calamities;
then we offer up prayers with strong cries; then, like bowed and bruised reeds,
we fall flat down to the ground, then our hearts swell with grief, and our
eyes are big with tears, and if Gods hand lie very heavy and long upon us,
we bid defiance to all worldly pleasures and comforts, which fail us in our
greatest extremity: we grow weary of this life, and in our desires run to meet
death the half way, and sigh, and mourn, and pine away till we be quite
dissolved, that we may be with Christ. In regard of these and such like
wholesome fruits, which meekness and patience gather from the cross, I dare
undertake to make good that seeming Paradox of Demetrius concerning evils,
Nihil eo infoelicius, cui nihil infoelix contigit; None is so miserable as he
who in this life never tasted any misery: For, besides that continual
pleasures glut his senses, and his very happiness cloyeth him, he wants
many improvements of his wisdom, many trials of his faith, Apoc. 3.19. Prove.
3.12. Heb. 12.5.
many exercises of his patience, many incentives of his zeal, many
preservatives against sin; and, which weighs all down, many arguments of
Gods love toward him, and care over him. If the Schoolmasters eye be always
upon his Scholar to observe him, if he still check and correct him for his
faults, it is a sign he bears a singular affection to him, and has a
special care over him; but if he let him loyter and play the trewant, and
abuse his fellows, and never call him to an account for it, it is evident
thereby, that he intends to leave, or has already left the tuition of him.
In like manner, whiles the Physician prescribes to his patient unpleasing diet
and bitter potions, and is ever trying some medicine or other upon him, the
friends of the sick are in good hope; but when the Physician leaves
prescribing physic, and forbids his patient nothing that he has a mind unto,
though he grow still worse and worse, then all that are about him take on
grievously, and shed tears in secret, as knowing well that their friend is
given over by the Doctor for desperate. Which Saint Bernard seriously
considering, delivers this strange, yet most true Aphorism, Illi vere
irascitur Deus, cui non irascitur: God is angry indeed with him, Quem enim in
presenti non emendat, in futuro condemnat.
to whom he shows it not by rebuking and chastening him for his sin. For
whom he mends not by chastening in this world, he certainly purposes to
condemn in the other: This is a ruled case in Divinity, Dives is a president
for it.

If things stand thus in this world, let no Christian flatter himself with a
vain hope of uninterrupted prosperity, and unmixed joys in this life: Invicem
cedunt dolor and voluptas, pleasures and sorrows have their turns; as sorrows
end in joys, so joys in sorrows. There is a cup of trembling which cannot
pass, but first or last we must taste of it: and since we must; let us look
for it, and when it comes to us, cheerfully off with it; the rather, because
our Lord and Savior has begun in it deep unto us. O ye Favorites, and (if I
may so speak) Minions of Fortune, who are driven with a prosperous gale, and
bear a lofty sail, swelling with the pride of a high mind, strike sail in
time, look soon for a bitter Hieron. ad Helod. Licet in modum stagni fusum
aequor arrideat, licet vix summa jacentis elementi spiritu terga crispentur,
magnos hic campus montes haber, tranquillitas ista tempestas est.
storm: Though the smooth sea smile upon thee, and seem to be no other than
a standing poole, though the top of the water by the wind be not so much as
cast into bubbles, like the curles of thy hair, trust not the deep; the plain
thou see has many mountains in it, the present calm will prove in the end
a tempest: or else assure thy self thou sailest not in Christ's ship; for that
was tossed in the sea, and even covered with waves, Matthew. 8.24.
yet not drowned: Jactatur, nunquam mergitur ista ratis.

How should the ship be drowned or cast away upon the rocks, wherein Christ is
the Pilot, the Scripture the Card, his Cross the maine Mast, his promises,
Matthew. 28.20 Matthew. 16.18.
( I will be with you to the end of the world, and, Hell gates shall not
prevail against it) the Anchors, his holy Spirit the Wind? This makes the
Church bold, not only to check and repress the insolency of her enemies,
Micah 7.8.
saying, Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy, though I fall I shall rise; when
I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me: but also glory in the
Lord, Psalm. 129.1.
and insult over them, saying, Many a time have they afflicted me from my
youth up, Romans 8.37.
but they have not prevailed against me: Nay, In all things we are more than
Conquerours, through him that loved us. David often harpeth upon this sweet
string, Psalm. 118.18.
The Lord has chastened me sore, but he has not given me over unto death:
Psalm. 37.24.
the righteous falls, yet shall not be utterly cast down. What an excellent
harmony does St. Paul make of seeming discords! 2 Cor. 4 8 9.
(...), We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not altogether without means; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down,
but not destroyed: that is (to set the Prophets ditty to the Apostles tune) We
are continually bruised, yet not broken. He shall not break.

I foresee what you may object, That many of Gods servants, and Christ's
soldiers have had their flesh torn with whips, their joints hewn asunder,
their bones broken on the rack, and sometimes ground to powder with the teeth
of wild beasts; nay, their whole body burnt to ashes, and these ashes cast
into the river: Fox in Martyrol. Crispine H^^tor. Wald Aeneas S^^^ de gilt.
Council. Basil.
how say we then, the bruised reed is never broken, nor the smoking flax
quenched?

For this blow we have a fourfold ward:

1. We are to understand, that Gods promises of delivering his Saints are
principally and simply to be taken of their eternal deliverance; but of
temporal secondarily, and conditionally, as it stands with his glory, and
their greater good.

2. We are to note, that many of the promises above mentioned concern the
entire body of the Church, not every particular member. The bruised reed may be
broken in some part, yet not through the whole: Tyrants may waste and destroy
the Church partially, but not totally, for the reasons intimated by Tertullian
and S. Leo, Tertulan apolog. Sanguis Martyrum semen Evangelii. Leo sermon. Grana
quae singula cadunt multiplicata nascuntut.
because the blood of Martyrs spilt upon the ground is like spiritual seed,
from whence spring up new Martyrs: and the grains of corn which fall one by
one, and die in the earth, rise up again in great numbers. Persecution serves
the Church in such stead, as pruning does the Vine, whereby her branches shoot
forth farther, and bear more fruit. Therefore S. Hierome excellently compares
the militant Church, burning still in some part in the heat of persecution, and
yet flourishing, to the bush in Exodus, Exodus 3.2.
out of which Gods glory shined to Moses, which burned, yet consumed not.

3. We are to distinguish between corporal and spiritual destruction: Though
the cane be crushed to pieces, yet the air in the hollow of it is not hurt;
though the tree be hewn, the beam of the Sun shining upon it is not cut or
parted in sunder. Fear not them, says our Savior, Matthew. 10.28.
which can kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Could the
Philosopher say, tundis vasculum: Anaxarchi, non Anaxarchum, Thou beatest the
vessel, or strikest the coffin of Anaxarchus, not Anaxarchus himself, O
Tyrant? Shall not a Christian with better reason say to his tormentors, Ye
break the box, ye spill not any of the ointment; ye violate the casket, ye
touch not the jewel? neither have ye so much power as utterly and perpetually
to destroy the casket (viz.) my body; for though it be beat to dust, and ground
to powder, yet shall it be set together again, and raised up at the last day,
Philip. 3.21.
and made conformable to Christ's glorious body by the power of God, whereby he
is able to subdue all things to himself.

4. And lastly, it is not here said simply the bruised reed shall not be
broken, but shall not be broken by him, He shall not break the bruised reed.

He shall not break: for he came not to destroy, but to save; Luk 9.56. Esaias
53.4. Mat. 27.30. And they took a reed and smote him on the head.
not to burden, but to ease; not to lay load upon us, but to carry all our
sorrows; not to break the bruised reed, but rather to have reeds broken upon
him, wherewith he was smote. Plin. not. hist. l. 11. Icti a scorbionibus
nunquam postea a crabronibus, vespis, apibusve feriuntur.
Pliny observes, that those that are stricken by Scorpions, are ever after
privileged from the stings of Waspes or Bees. The beasts that were torn or
hurt by any accident, might not be sacrificed or eaten. It is more than enough
to be once or singly miserable: whereupon he in the Greek Poet passionately
pleades against further molestation, (...). For Gods sake disease not a
diseased man, press not a dying man with more weight. Which because the
enemies of David had the hard hearts to do, he most bitterly cursed them:
Pour out thine indignation upon them, Psalm. 69.24, 25, 26.
and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them; let their habitation be
desolate, and let none dwell in their tents: for they persecute him whom thou
have smitten, and talk to the grief of those whom thou have wounded. O how
grievously does S. Cyprian complain against the inhumane cruelty of the
persecutors of Christians in his time, who laid stripes upon stripes, Cypr.
epist. ad Mart. In servis Dei non torquebantur membra, sed vulnera.
and inflicted wounds upon sores, and tortured not so much the members of Gods
servants, as their bleeding wounds! Verily for this cause alone God commanded,
that the name of Exodus 17.14.
Amaleck should be blotted out from under heaven, because they met Israel by
the way when they were faint, and smote the feeble among them. For not to
comfort the afflicted, not to help a man that is hurt, not to seek to hold
life in one that is swouning, is inhumanity; but contrarily, to afflict the
afflicted, to hurt the wounded, to trouble the grieved in spirit, Cic. pro
Celio.
sua sponte cadentem maturius extinguere vulnere, to strike the breath out of a
man's body who is giving up the ghost, to break a reed already bruised, to
insult upon a condemned man, to vex him that is broken in heart, and add
sorrow to sorrow, Oh this is cruelty upon cruelty; far be it from any
Christian to practice it, and yet further from his thoughts, to cast any such
aspersion upon the Father of mercy. How should the God of all consolation drive
any poor soul to desperation? he that will not break a bruised reed, will
he despise a broken heart? He that will not quench the smoking flax, will he
quench his Spirit, and tread out the sparks of his grace in our souls? No,
no, his Father sealed to him another commission, Esaias 61.1.
to preach good tidings to the meek, Luke 4.18.
to bind up the broken hearted, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to
give unto them that mourn in Sion beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for
mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. And accordingly
he sent by his Prophet a comfortable message to the daughter of Sion, Matthew.
ex Zach.
Tell her, behold the King comes unto thee meek, and riding upon an Ass: a
bruised reed he shall not break, he did not break; and smoking flax he
shall not quench, he did not quench. Was not Peter a bruised reed when he
fell upon the rock of offense, and thrice denied his Master, and went out and
wept bitterly? Was not Paul like smoking flax in the worst sense, when he
breathed out threats against the Church, and sought by all violent means to
smother the new light of the Gospel? yet we all see what a burning and shining
lamp Christ has made of this smoking flax: what a noble cane to write the
everlasting mercies of God to all posterity he has made of the other, a
bruised reed: But what speak I of bruised reeds not broken? the Jews that
crucified the Lord of life, the Roman soldier that pierced his side, were
liker sharp pointed darts than bruised reeds; yet some of these were saved from
breaking. Such is the virtue of the blood of our Redeemer, that it cleansed
their hands that were imbrued in the effusion thereof, if they afterward touch
it by faith: so infinite is the value of his death, that it was a satisfaction
even for them who were authors of it, and saved some of the murderers of their
Savior, as St. Cypr. epist. Vivificatur Christi sanguine etiam qui effudit
sanguinem Christi.
Cyprian most comfortably deduceth out of the second of the Acts: They are
quickened by Christ's blood who spilt it. Well therefore might St. Bern. Quid tam
ad mortem, quod non Christi morte sanetur.
Bernard demand, What is so deadly which Christ's death cannot heal? Comfort
then, O comfort the fainting spirits, and strengthen the feeble knees, revive
the spirit of the humble, raise up the prostrate and dejected soul. Be of good
cheer ye that have received the sentence of death in your selves. There is no
malady of the soul so deadly, against which the death of Christ is not a
sovereign remedy; there is no sore so great nor so festering, which a plaster
of Christ's blood will not cleanse and heal, if it be thereto applied by a
lively faith.

Thus, as you see, I have made of the bruised reed a staff of comfort for a
drouping conscience to stay it self upon; extend but your patience to the
length of the hour, and I will make of it a strait rule for your actions and
affections. Though all the actions of our Savior are beyond example, yet ought
they to be examples to us for our imitation; and though we can never overtake
him, yet we ought to follow after him. His life is a perfect samplar of all
virtues, out of which if we ought to take any flower, especially this of
meekness, which himself has pricked out for us, saying, Learn of me that I
am meek and lowly in heart, Matthew. 11.29.
and you shall find rest to your souls, which also he richly sets forth
with a title of blessedness over it, Matthew. 5.5.
and a large promise of great possessions by it; Blessed are the meek, for they
shall inherit the earth: Matthew. 5.7.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Neither is this
virtue more acceptable in the sight of God, than agreeable to the nature of
man. Witness our sleek and soft skin without scales or roughness; witness
our harmless members without horns, claws, or stings, the offensive weapons
of other creatures; witness our tender and relenting heart, apt to receive the
least impression of grief; witness our moist eyes, ready to shed tears upon
any sad accident: -- mollissima corda
Humano generi dare se natura fatetur,
Quae lachrymas dedit, haec nostri pars optima sensus.


Shall not grace imprint that virtue in our souls, which nature has expressed
in the chief members of our bodies, and exemplified in the best creatures
almost in every kind? Even among beasts, the tamest and gentlest are the best;
the master Be either has no sting at all, or (as Aristotle testifies) never
uses it. The upper region of the air is always calm and quiet, inferiora
fulminant, says Seneca, men of baser and inferior natures are boisterous and
tempestuous: The superior spheres move regularly, and uniformly, and the first
mover of them all is slow in his proceedings against rebellious sinners; he
was longer in destroying Jericho, than in creating the whole world. And when
Adam and Eve had sinned with a high hand, reaching the forbidden fruit, and
eating it, it was the cool of the evening before the voice of the Lord was
heard in the garden, and the voice that was heard, was of God walking, not
running: to verify those many attributes of God, Merciful, gracious,
long-suffering, Exodus 34.6, 7.
and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, and transgression, and sin.

Is God merciful, and shall man be cruel? is the master meek and mild, and
shall the servant be fierce and furious? shall he give the Lamb in his
Scutchion, and they the Lion? If he who rules the Nations with a rod of iron,
and breaks them in pieces like a potters vessel, will not break the bruised
reed, shall reeds break reeds? Martial. Epigr.
The Heathen Poet giving charge to his wooden god to look to his garden,
uses this commination, See thou look well to my trees, Alioqui and ipse
lignum es, Otherways know that thou art wood thy self, that is, fit fuel for
the fire. Suffer, I beseech you, the word of exhortation; Look to it that you
break not Christ's bruised reeds, Alioqui and ipsi estis arundines, Otherways
know that you your selves are but reeds, and what measure you mete unto others,
shall be measured unto you again. Stand not too much upon your own Sen. de
clem. l. 1. Nec est quisquam cui tam valde innocentia sua placeat, ut non stare
in conspectu clementiam paratam humanis erroribus gaudeat.
innocence and integrity: For, August. confess. l. 13. Vae laudabili vitae
hominum, si remot a misericordia discutias came.
Woe be to the commendable life of men, if it be searched into without mercy,
and scanned exactly. The Cherubins themselves continually look toward the
Mercy-seat: and if we expect mercy at the hands of God or man, we must show
mercy; for there shall be judgment without mercy, to him that will show no
mercy: which menacing to the unmercifull, though it point to the last
judgment, and then take it is full effect, yet to deter men from this
unnatural sin against their own bowels, it pleases God sometimes in this
life to make even reckonings with hard hearted men, and void of all compassion.
As he did with Appius, Livius dec. 1.
of whom Livie reports, that he was a great oppressor of the liberties of the
commons, and particularly that he took away all appeals to the people in
case of life and death. But see how Justice revenged Mercies quarrel upon this
unmercifull man; soon after this his decree, he being called in question for
forcing the wife of Virginius, he found all the Bench of Judges against him,
and was constrained for saving his life to prefer an appeal to the people,
which was denied him with great shouts and outcries of all, saying, Ecce
provocat, qui provocationem sustulit; who sees not the hand of divine Justice
herein? He is forced to appeal, who by barring all appeals in case of life
and death, was the death of many a man. Let his own measure be returned upon
him. And as Appius was denied the benefit of appeals, whereof he deprived
others, and immediately felt the stroke of justice; so Eutropius, who gave the
Emperor counsel to shut up all Sanctuaries against capital offenders,
afterward being pursued himself for his life, and flying to a Sanctuary for
refuge, was from thence drawn out by the command of S. Chrysostom, and
delivered to the ministers of justice, who made him feel the smart of his own
pernicious counsel. I need the less speak for mercy, by how much the more
we all need it: and therefore I pass from the act to the proper subject of
mercy, The bruised reed. If Sen. de cle. l. 1. Tam omnibus ignoscere crudelitas
est quam nulli. Jude ver. 22.
mercy should be showed unto all men, no place would be left for justice;
therefore St. Jude restrains mercy to some, Of some have compassion, making a
difference. The difference we are to make is of 1. Sin. 2. Sinners.
For there are sins of ignorance, and sins against conscience; sins of
infirmity, and sins of presumption; sudden passions, and deliberate evil
actions; light stains, and foul spots: some sins are secret and private,
others public and scandalous; some silent, others crying; some prejudicial
only to the delinquent, others pernicious to the Church and Commonwealth. For
the former, mercy often intercedeth, seldom or never for the latter.

Again, some offenders are like Eras. Adag. (...).
heart of oak; which many strong blows of an axe will scarce enter; others
like the Balsamum of Judea, which you kill if you Plin. not. hist. l. 12. c.
25. Inciditur vitro, lapide, osleisve cultellis, fertum odit, laesis vitalibus
emoritur, protenus incidentis manus libratur artifici temperamento, ne quid
ultra corticem violet.
touch but the rine of it with an iron instrument: and therefore they which keep
them, provide instruments of glass, or knives of bone to prune them. The
former resemble the Adamant, which can be cut or pointed by nothing but an
Adamant; the latter the Solinus c 40. tit Euphrates. Pyrrhites teneri se
vehementiu, non permittit ac si quando arctiore manu premitur, digitos adurit.
Pyrrhite, a precious stone, which may be gently ground or cut with a sharp
tool, but if you press it hard, or handle it rudely, it burns the fingers.
For the latter mercy sometimes intercedeth, not so for the former. Lastly,
after the offense committed, some are like bruised reeds, falling down upon
the earth, and imploring mercy: Others like a stiff or strait cane, never so
much as bowing; some stand in defense of that they have done, others
ingenuously confess their fault; some glory in their sin, others are
confounded with it: in a word, some are obstinate, some are penitent; those
mercy disclaimeth, these she often takes to her protection. They who in
former times like pipes of reeds have sweetly sounded out the praises of God,
but now are cracked with some pardonable error in judgment, or slip in
manners, if they be truly bruised with the weight of their sin, and
thoroughly contrite, may plead the privilege of the bruised reed in my Text,
not to be broken by any over hard and severe censure or sentence, not the
Atheistical scoffer, not the impudent Adulterer, not the obstinate Recusant,
not Jesuited Papists, which like the Egyptian reeds mentioned by the Prophet,
run Esa. 36.6. Thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt,
whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it.
into the hands and sides even of Jaques Clement, and Ra^iliac, who murdered
two late Fren^h Kings, Henr. 3. and 4. See Pierre Matthew, and other French
Historians.
Kings and Princes. They who have formerly shined before their brethren, both
in their pure doctrine and good example, though now by the violent blast of
some fearful temptation, are blown out as it were, and send up bitter fumes
of sorrowful lamentations for their sinful iniquity or impurity, in some
cases are not to be quenched; what therefore are not heretical apostataes, and
schismatic boutefieus and firebrarnds of Church and State, not to be
quenched and trod out, which if they be not quenched in time, will set all in
a combustion in the end?

To conclude, as I began, with the words of my Text; it is the bruised reed
that is not to be broken, not the poisoned dart; it is the smoking flax that
is not to be quenched, not the burning match. A bruised reed he shall not
break. Behold in the reed your frailty, in the bruised reed your condition; in
the not breaking the bruised reed, a singular rule for your direction, of which
I spoke but now, and a strong staff of comfort, of which before.

God grant that we may all acknowledge our frailty, as being no other than
reeds, and to arm our selves with patience against manifold pressures and
tribulations, as being reeds that are or shall be bruised; and when we are
afflicted or oppressed, not to despair of help and ease, but to trust in Gods
mercy, and hope for a joyful deliverance, as bruised reeds that yet are not to
be broken: and lastly, expecting mercy for our selves, show mercy with
discretion unto others, as being reeds, therefore not broken, that we may
learn by the example of our Lord and Master not to break the bruised reed. To
whom, etc.

THE SMOKING FLAX. A Sermon preached at Lambeth before his Grace, the Lord
Bishop of London, and other his Majesty's Commissioners in causes
Ecclesiastical, December. 5. 1618. THE SECOND SERMON.
MAT. 12. and 20. ESAIAS 42. and 3. And smoking Flax shall he not quench.


Most REVEREND, etc.
THe sweet temper, and gracious disposition of our blessed Redeemer, is as the
sap in the root, which conveyeth life to the two branches of this Scripture.
For by it the d^y and bruised reed is nourished, as with moisture supplied; and
the smoking flax and dying lamp is refreshed, as it were with oil: That, he
will not break, this, he will not quench.

Luke 4.18.
He, who came to heal the broken hearted, and set at liberty them that are
bruised, will not break the bruised reed. He, who was sent to give light to
them that sit in darkness, Luke 1.79. (...). ita 70 Interp. Esaias 53 4.
and in the shadow of death, will not quench the smoking flax, or dimly
burning week. He, who bare all our infirmities, and carried our sorrows, will
not lay too heavy a burden upon those that are truly humbled, but will so
lightly pass over their sins, that he will not break or crush in pieces the
bruised reed, nor tread out the smoking flax.

This Text speaks peace and much comfort, yet not to all, but to the contrite
soul only. Matthew. 27.30.
The bruised and soft reed shall not be broken, but the stiff and hard reed,
like that wherewith Christ was smitten, shall be broken. They who after their
sins committed relent not at all, they who are not troubled in conscience,
nor crushed with fear of judgment, but stand in justification of their
sins, and excuse their profane sports on the Lords day, saying, they use but
lawful recreations, and their defiling the flesh, by pretending that it is but
a trick of youth, and their drunkenness, that it is but good fellowship, and
their sacrilege, that it is the custom to pay no more; and cover other vices
with the like cloakes, may challenge no interest in this promise: but the
bruised reed, that is, the contrite sinner, he who is displeased with himself,
because he has displeased his gracious God; he whose spirit grieveth, because
he has grieved Gods holy Spirit; he who because he has done that which God
abhors, abhors himself in dust and ashes; he who when God chasteneth
him for his sins, kisseth his heavenly Fathers rod, and acknowledges that
he deserves far smarter blows than those which yet he feels; he who
goes mourning all the day long, and will never be at peace with himself, till
he has made his peace with his Maker; he who always feeling the weight of
his sins, sigheth and groaneth under them, and never cease to offer up
prayers to God with strong cries, till he be eased of them. Are we such
bruised reeds? We often in stead of denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
have with Peter denied our Master; but do we weep bitterly with him, and (as
he) whenever he heard the Cock crow after the denial of his Master, fell
on weeping afresh; so, do the wounds of our consciences bleed afresh at the
sight of every object, and hearing of every sound, which puts us in mind of our
crimson sins? We have polluted our beds with David, but do we cleanse them
as he did? do we make our couches to swim with tears of repentance? We
have entertained with Mary Magdalen many soul sins, like so many unclean
spirits; but have we broken a box of precious ointment upon Christ's head, or
kneeled down and washed his feet with our tears? If we have done so, then
are we bruised reeds indeed, and shall not be broken; but if otherwise we be
not bruised in heart for our sins, and break them off by mature repentance,
we shall be either broken for them by sore chastisements in this world, or
(which is worst of all) like unfruitful and rotten trees, be reserved to be
fuel for Hell fire.

But because the bruised reed was the measure of my former discourse, I will
now fall to blow the smoking flax, which Christ will not quench. To quench
the light, especially the light of the spirit in our hearts, seems to be a
work of darkness, how then may it be ascribed to the Father of lights, or
what means the Prophet to deny that Christ will do that which is so
repugnant to his nature, that if he would, he could not do it? Religiously
learned antiquity has long ago assoyled this doubt, teaching us, that God
quenches as he hardneth, Non infundendo malitiam, sed subducendo gratiam, not
by pouring on any thing like water to quench the flame, but by taking away that
oily moisture which nourishes it. Our daily experience shows us, that a
lamp or candle may be extinguished three manner of ways at least: 1. By a
violent puff of wind. 2. By the ill condition of the week, indisposed to
burn. 3. By want of wax, or defect of oil to feed it.


Even so the light of the Spirit may be quenched in us by three means: either
by a violent temptation of the evil spirit, as it were a puff of wind; or by
the inbred corruption of our nature, repelling grace, which fitly resembles
the indisposition of the week to take fire, or keep in it the flame; or lastly,
by subtraction of divine grace, which is the oil or sweet wax that
maintains this light. By the first means the Devil, by the second man
himself, by the third God quenches the light of the spirit in them who love
darkness more than light; but such are not those, who in my Text are compared
to smoking flax. For though they have small light of knowledge to shine to
others, yet they have heat of devotion burning in themselves: Hill. In haec
verba igniculum fidei concipientes, and quadam dilectione cum carne, juxta
fumantes quos Christus non extinxit, sed incendit in iis ignem perfectae
charitatis.
they are such, says St. Hilary, Who conceiving in themselves a small spark
of faith, because they are in part still flesh, burn not clearly, but as it
were smoakily, whom Christ will not quench, but kindle in them the fire of
perfect charity. St. Greg. in Evan. Dom. Quod sacerdotes lineis uterentur
vestibus.
Gregory by smoking flax understands the Aaronicall Priesthood now dimly
burning, and ready to go out, he thinks the flax to have some reference to
the Priests linen garments made of it. Tertullian paraphraseth the smoking
flax, Momentaneum gentium fervorem, The momentary fervor of the Gentiles, in
whom the light of nature by sinful filthiness being extinct, exhaleth most
pestiferous fumes of noisome lusts. St. Chrysostom. in Matthew. ca. 2. (...).
Chrysostom and St. Austin through the smoke discern the Scribes and
Pharisees, and other enemies of Christ, their envy and malice which soultred
within them, but brake not out into an open flame. Whom Christ quenched not,
that is, destroyed not, though he could have as easily done it, as break a
reed already bruised, or tread out a stinking snuff cast upon the ground. But
these expositions in the judgment of later Divines seem either constrained and
forced, or at the lest too much restrained and narrow. They therefore extend the
meaning of them to all weak Christians, either newly converted or relapsed,
Pintus.
In quibus tamen relucet aliquid bonae spei. Junius.
Scintilla aliqua pietatis veluti moribunda. Aquinas.
Tepidi ad opus bonum, habentes tamen aliquid gratiae. Arboreus.
Extinctioni vicini. Guilliandus.
Qui sceleribus gravissimis, seu fumo quodam oculos bonorum offendunt, and
veluti foetore corruptae famae mores piorum infestant: Breathing out bitter
fumes for their sins, offending the godly with the ill savor of their lives,
lukewarm to good works, near extinction, in whom yet remains some light of
faith and hope, though very obscure, some warmth of charity, some spark of
grace. Comfort then, O comfort the fainting spirits, and cheer up the drouping
conscience, say to the bruised reed that is now unfit to make a pipe to sound,
or a cane to write the praises of God, thou shall not be broken; and to the
smoking flax, which gives but a very dim light, and with the fume offends
the eyes of the godly, and with the stench their noses, thou shall not be
quenched. Nothing is so easy as to break a reed already bruised, the least
weight does it; nothing so facile as to quench smoking flax, the least touch
does it: yet so mild was our Savior, that he never brake the one, nor
quenched the other. The flax or week smoaketh, either before it is fully
kindled, or after it is blown out. If we consider it in the first condition,
the moral or spiritual meaning of the Text is, that Christ cherishes the
weak endeavors, and small beginnings of grace in his children. For we must
know, that in our first conversion the measure of grace is but small in us, and
mixed with much corruption, which if Christ should quench, there would be found
never a clear burning lamp in his Church; but he most graciously preserves
it, and augmenteth it, because it is a spark from heaven kindled by his own
spirit: and it much illustrateth his glory, to keep it from going out,
notwithstanding the indisposition of the week to burn, and continual blasts
of temptation ready to blow it out. I said in my haste, quoth David, I am cast
out of thy sight: there is smoke in the flax, Psalm. 31.22.
yet was not the flax quenched; for he adds, yet thou heardest the voice of
my prayer. Jonas in like manner cries, I am cast out of thy sight: Jonah 2.4.
there is smoke in the flax, yet was not the flax quenched; for he adds
immediately, yet I will look again to thy holy Temple. If thou will, thou
can, Matthew. 8.2.
said one poor man in the Gospel. Lord, if thou can, said another; Mark
9.22.
both these were as the smoking flax in my Text. For the former doubted of
Gods power, the latter of his will, yet neither of both were quenched. O
miserable man that I am, says S. Paul, in the person of a Christian traveling
in his new birth, who shall deliver me from this body of death? here is a cloud
of smoke, Romans 7.24.25.
yet it is blown away in an instant, and the flame breaks out, and blazeth
into Gods praises; Thanks be unto God, who has given us victory through Jesus
Christ. Man for a little smoke will quench the light; but Christ every where
cherishes the least spark of grace, and blows it gently by his spirit, till
it break forth into a flame. To encourage us the more, he accepts the will
for the deed, and a good assay for the performance. If thou can but shed a
tear for thy sins, he has a bottle to put it in; if thou steal a sigh in
secret, he has an ear for it; if thy faith be but as a grain of mustard
seed, it shall grow to a great tree. Nathanael at the first had but a small
ground to believe that Christ should be the Messiah; but afterward Christ
made good his words unto him, he saw greater things to build his faith upon:
Because I said unto thee, John 1.50.
I saw thee under the fig tree, beleevest thou? thou shall see greater things
than these. Apollos at the first was but catechized in John's Baptism, Act.
18.27.28.
but afterward Aquila and Priscilla expounded unto him the way of God more
perfectly, and he helped them much which had believed through grace: for he
mightily convicted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the Scriptures
that Jesus was Christ. Joseph of Arimathea, richer in grace than wealth, and a
great dispreader of the Gospel, and (as many ancient Writers report) the first
planter of Christian Religion in this Island, yet till Christ's death had small
courage to profess him; but when the evening was come, Mar. 15.42.43.
which was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, he went in
boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. Saint Augustine at the first
was drawn to the Church by the luster of Saint Ambrose his eloquence, as
himself Aug. confess. l. 5. c. 4.
confesses: but afterward he was much more taken with the strength of his
proof, than the ornaments of his speech; and God by his Spirit so blowed the
spark of divine knowledge in this smoking flax, that the Church of God never
saw a cleerer lamp burning in it since it had him.

If we consider the smoking flax in the second condition, to wit, after the
lamp is blown out, the spiritual meaning is, That those in whom there was
ever any spark of saving grace, shall never be quenched; or that after the most
fearful blast of temptation, there remains yet some divine fire in the heart
of every true believer, which Christ will never quench. Christ will not quench
the smoking flax, if there be any spark of divine fire in it: yet if this
spark be not blown, and the week enlightened again, it will dye; in like
manner if we do not according to the Apostles precept, 2 Timothy 1.6.
(...), stir up the grace of God in us, and use the utmost of our religious
endeavors to kindle again the lamp of faith in our souls, that spark of
divine faith and saving grace which we conceive that we have, will dye. As it
is not presumption, but faith, to be confident in Gods promises when we walk
in his Ordinances; so it is not faith, but presumption, to assure our selves of
the end, when we neglect the means of our salvation. We may no otherwise
apprehend or apply unto our selves the gracious promises made to all true
believers in the Gospel, than they are propounded unto us, which is not
absolutely, but upon conditions by us to be performed through the help of
divine grace, namely, to wash our selves, Esa. 1.16, 17.
to make us clean, to put away the evil of our doings from before Gods eyes,
to cease to do evil, to learn to do well, to seek judgment, to relieve
the oppressed, to judge the fatherless, Dan. 4.27. Job 41.^. Apoc. 3.19. Mat.
3.8.
and to plead for the widow, to break off our sins by righteousness, and
our iniquity by showing mercy to the poor, to abhor our selves, and repent
in dust and ashes, to remember from whence we are fallen, and do our first
works, to be zealous and amend, and to bring forth fruits meet for
repentance. To argue from a strong persuasion of our election, and from thence
to infer immediately assurance of salvation, is, as Tertullian speaks in
another case, aedificare in ruinam. The safe way to build our selves in our
most holy faith, and surely fasten the anchor of our hope, is to conclude from
amendment of life, repentance unto life: from our hatred of sin, Gods love
unto us: from hunger and thirst after righteousness, some measure of grace:
from godly sorrow and sonne-like fear, and imitation of our heavenly Father,
the adoption of sons: from continual growth in grace, perseverance to the
end: from the fruits of charity, the life of our faith: and from all, a modest
assurance of our election unto eternal life. Not curiously to dispute the
Scholasticall question concerning the absolute impossibility of the apostasy
of any Saint, and the amissibility of justifying faith, which many learned
Doctors of the Reformed Churches hold fitter to be extermined than
determined, or at least confined to the Schools, than defined in the Pulpit:
that wherein all parties agree is sufficient to comfort the fainting spirits,
and strengthen the feeble knees of any relapsed Christian; That God will never
be wanting to raise him, if he be not wanting to himself. But if when he
is returned, with the Sow to his wallowing in the mire, he takes delight
therein, and never striveth to pluck his feet out of it, nor rise up out of
the dirt, if he never cry for help, nor so much as put forth the hand of his
faith, that Christ may take hold of it, and by effectual grace draw him out of
the mudde: he will certainly putrify in his sins. He that hears the Word
of God preached, and assenteth thereunto, and is most firmly persuaded of Gods
love to him for the present, if through the rebellion of the flesh against the
spirit, or the suggestions of Satan, or by the wicked counsels and examples of
others, he charge himself with any foul sin, either of impiety against
God, or iniquity against men, or impurity against his own body, does not his
conscience tell him, that God is highly displeased with him? does he not feel
the effects of his wrath in his soul, and oftentimes in his body and estate
also? and if the hand of God upon him bring him not to a sight, and a sense,
and an acknowledgement, and a detestation also of his sin, dare any man
secure his salvation? On the contrary, if after his relapse, his heart smite
him, and he feels the prick of conscience, if there be any spark in the
week, any bitter fume drawing tears from his eyes, any fervor of zeal, any
heat of love in him, any vehement desire of saving grace, though he receive
the sentence of death in himself, and breathe out his last gasp in a
disconsolate sigh, and with a lamentable groan; yet none doubts, but that he
may pass even by the gates of Hell into Heaven. There is nothing so easy or
frequent, as for a man to slip or fall who walks upon the ice; and what is
this world, compared by Saint John to a sea of glass, Apoc. 15.2.
but slippery ice? in which though they who go most warily slide often, and
receive grievous falls; yet they may take such hold on the one side upon the
promises of God, Jer. 31.40.
(I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in
their hearts, that they shall not depart from me:) and on the other side upon
Christ's prayer, (I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not) that they
fall not irrecoverably, or so dangerously, as that they dye of their fall. Luke
22.31.
For whose comfort in their fearfullest conflicts with despair, I will lay
such grounds of confidence, as will amount to a hope that makes not ashamed,
and at least to a moral assurance of the recovery of their former estate.

In the ninth of Proverbs and the first, we have a description of a house
built by Wisdom: Prove. 9.1.
Wisdom, says he, has built her an house, she has hewn out her seven
pillars. By this house, albeit some of the Ancients understand the incarnation
of the Son of God, who is the Wisdom of his Father, and might be said then
to build him an house, when he framed a body to himself; yet may it be
applied to the spiritual house, which every Christian builds by faith upon
the rock Christ Jesus; for as that, so this stands upon seven pillars: 1.
The constancy of Gods love in Christ. 2. The certainty of his decrees. 3. The
truth of his promises. 4. The power of regenerating grace. 5. The efficacy of
Christ's prayer and intercession for all Believers. 6. The safeguard of the
Almighties protection. 7. The testimony of the true ancient Church, which the
Apostle himself graceth with the title of the pillar and ground of truth.


The first pillar to support this building is the constancy of Gods love to all
that are in Christ; which may be thus hewn to our purpose. They upon whom God
sets such an especial affection in Christ, that he makes a covenant of
peace, and enters into a contract of marriage with them, can never be cast
utterly out of favor, much less grow into eternal hatred and detestation, in
such sort that they become the objects of endless misery, and subjects of
everlasting malediction. For this kindness, whereby the Lord our Redeemer has
mercy on us, Esa. 1.54.8. With everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee,
says the Lord thy Redeemer.

Ver. 10. The mountains shall depart, and the ^^ls be removed, but my kindness
shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed.


is everlasting. The covenant of this peace is immovable, this contract is
indissoluble: Hos. 2.19, 20.
I will betroth thee unto me for ever; I will betroth thee unto me in
righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies. I
will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou shall know the Lord. But
all true believers are embraced with this love, comprised within this covenant,
parties in this contract. What then can steal their hearts from Christ, or
alienate his love from them? Romans 8, 35.38.
What shall separate them from this love of God in Christ? shall tribulation, or
anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril? No, neither
death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,
shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord. That fire which generateth and produces its own fuel can never go
out; and what is the fuel which nourishes this heavenly flame, but grace and
virtue in us, which it self continually works in all them that are new
creatures in Christ? Men affect others because of worth: but contrariwise, Gods
affection causes worth in all who are indeared unto him. All the spiritual
beauty they have wherewith he is enamoured, is no other than the reflection and
glisening of the beams of his grace, which Heb. 12.2. Looking unto Jesus the
beginner and finisher of our faith.
begins and consummateth all good in us, Phil. 2.13. For it is God that
works in us both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
working in us both the will and the deed. Philosophy teaches that the
celestial and superior bodies work upon the terrestrial and inferior, but
not on the contrary. The storms or calmes in the air change not the motions
or influence of the stars: but contrariwise the motions, conjunctions and
influences of the Stars cause such variety in the air and earth. The rays
of the visible Sun are not moved at all by the motion of the object, but
immoveably flow from the body of that Planet; and though blustering winds
tyrannize in the air, and remove it a thousand times out of its place in an
hour, yet they stir not therewith: in like manner, though our affections are
transported with every gale of prosperity and storm of adversity, and our
wills somewhat yield to every wind of temptation; yet Gods affections, like the
beams of the Sun, remain immovable where they are once fixed. We play
fast and loose even with those oftentimes to whom we are bound in the
strongest bonds of duty and love; we praise and dispraise with a breath,
frown and smile with a look, Esaias 55.8.
love and hate with a conceit: but Gods affections are not like ours, John 13.1.
nor are his thoughts our thoughts. For having loved his own which were in the
world, 2 Timothy 2.13.
he loves them unto the end: and though we believe not, yet he abides
faithful; he cannot deny himself.

The second pillar is the certainty of Gods decree for the salvation of the
Elect; 2 Timothy 2 19.
and thus I rear it up. The foundation of God stands sure, having this
seal, The Lord knows them that are his. How should he not know them whom he
fore-knew before the world began, and wrote their names in the book of life?
Apoc. 13.8. Phil. 4.3 With my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of
life. Exodus 28.21.
A glorious type whereof was the engraving the names of the twelve Tribes in
twelve precious stones, with the point of a Diamond, never to be razed out. To
seduce any of the Elect, our Saviors Mat. 24.24. And they shall show great
signs and wonders, in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the
very Elect.
If supposes it to be impossible, for this were to pluck Christ's sheep out of
his hand, Joh. 10.28, 29 They shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of my hand: My Father which gave them (...) is greater than all, and
no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.
which none can do. All the Elect are those blessed ones on Christ's right hand,
to whom he shall say at the day of Judgment, Mat. 25.34.
Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you before
the foundation of the world was laid: they are the Church of the first borne,
which are written Heb. 12.23.
in heaven. Now although all that yield their assent to supernatural verities
revealed in Scripture, may not presume that their names are written in the
book of life; for Simon Magus believed, yet was he in Act. 18.13, 23
the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity: nay the Jam. 2.19.
Devils themselves, as St. James teaches us, believe, who are Jude 6.
reserved in chains of darkness, unto the judgment of the great day: yet
they who believe in God embrace the promises of the Gospel, with the condition
of denying of ungodliness, and worldly lusts; and living godly, righteously,
and soberly in this present world, and lay fast hold on Christ, have (no doubt)
attained that faith, which Saint Paul styles, Tit. 1.1.
the faith of Gods Elect: and Saint Act 13.48. and 15.9.
Luke makes an effect of predestination to eternal life: for such a Romans
3.28. Joh. 1.12.
faith purifieth the heart, justifies before God, puts us into the state of
adoption, works by love, and is accompanied with repentance unto life: which
gifts are never bestowed upon any reprobate, if we will believe the ancient
Greg. l. 28. in Job. c. 6. Extra Ecclesiae mensuras omnes reprobi, etiamsi
intra fidei limitem esse videantur. Aug. cont. Pel. l. 1. c 4 and de unit.
eccl. c. 23. Hoc donum prop^ium est eorum qui regnabunt cum Christo. Plin. not.
hist. l. 21. c. 8. Postquam d^ ficere cuncti flores, m^defactus aqua
reviviscit, and hybernas coron is facit.
Fathers. The seed of this faith being sown in good ground, takes deep root
downward in humility, and grows upward in hope, and spreads abroad by
charity, and brings forth fruits of good works in great abundance: it
resembles the true Amaranthus, which, after all the flowers are blown away,
or drop down at the fall of the leaf, being watered at the root, reviveth and
serves to make winter garlands: even so a firm and well grounded belief,
after the flowers of open profession of Christ are blown away by the violent
blasts of persecution and temptation, being moistened with the dew of grace
from heaven, and the water of penitent tears, reviveth again, and flourishes
and furnishes the Church, Christ's Spouse, as it were with winter garlands,
unlooked and unhoped for.

The third pillar. The love of God is not more constant than his decrees are
certain; nor his decrees more certain than his promises are faithful:
Therefore in the third place I erect for a third pillar, to support the
doctrine delivered out of this Scripture, the promise of perseverance; which I
need not hew nor square for the building, it fitteth of it self. For it
implies contradiction, that they who are endued with the grace of
perseverance, should utterly fall away from grace. Constancy is not constancy
if it vary, perseverance is not perseverance if it fail. And therefore S. Aug.
de bono persev c. 6. Hoc donum suppliciter emereri potest, sed cum datum est,
contumaciter amittti non potest; promodo enim potest amitti, per quod fit ut
non amittatur, etiam quod possit amitti?
Austin acutely determines, that this gift may be obtained by humble prayer,
but after what it is given, it cannot be lest by proud contumacy: for how
should that gift it self be lost, which keeps all other graces from being
lost, which otherwise might be lost? When I name the gift of perseverance in
the state of grace, I understand with that holy Father, such a gift, Aug. de
correp. and gr^t. c. 12. Non sol^ n ut sine isto dono persev^rantes ess^ non
possunt, verum etiam ut per hoc donu^ non nisi perseverantes sint. Gratia qua
subventum est infirmitati voluntatis humanae, ut indeclinabiliter and
insuperabiliter ageretur, and quam vis infirma non deficeret nec adversitate
aliqua vinceretur, sed quod bonum est invictissime vellet, and hoc differere
invictissime nollet.
not only without which we cannot persevere, but with which we cannot but
persevere. Such an heavenly grace, whereby the infirmity of man's will is
supported in such sort, that it is led by the spirit unfailably and
unconquerably, so that though it be weak, yet it never fails, nor is
overcome by any temptation, but cleaves most steadfastly to that which is good,
and cannot by any power be drawn to forsake it. This gift of the faithful is
shadowed out by those similitudes (whereto the godly and righteous man in
Scripture is compared) viz. of a Psalm. 1.3.
tree planted by the river side, whose leaf shall not wither. Of the hill of
Sion, which may not be removed, but stands fast for ever, Psalm. 125.1. Of a
Mat. 7.24.
house built upon a rock, Quae Obvia ventorum furiis expostaque ponto
Vim cunctam, atque minas perfert coelique marisque
Ipsa immota manens.
Upon which though the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
blew and beat on it, yet it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock: but it
is fully, plainly, and most evidently expressed, and promised in those words of
Jer. 32.40.
Jeremy, I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
away from them to do them good, and I will put my fear in their hearts, that
they shall not depart from me. Which Text of the Prophet is by the Heb. 5.10.
Apostle applied to the faithful under the Gospel, and thus expounded by S.
Austin: Aug. l. de bono persev. c. 2. Timorem dabo in cor, ut non recedant,
quid est aliud quam talis ac tantus erit timor, ut mihi perseveranter
adhaereant?
I will put my fear in their hearts, that they depart not from me, what is it
else than to say, the fear which I put in their hearts shall be such, and so
great, that they shall assuredly or perseveringly cleave unto me?

They whose hearts are kept always in this fear, need never fear final
Apostasy from God. Counterfeit Sen. de clem. l. 1. Nemo potest personam diu
ferte, ficta cito in naturam suam recidunt.
things are discovered by their discontinuance and variation, but true by their
lasting. That which glareth for a time in the air, and out-braveth the stars,
even of the first rank or magnitude, but after a few days plays least in
sight, is a Comet, no true star: Stella cadens, non est stella, cometa fuit.
Likewise that which glistereth like gold, yet endures not the fire, is Alchymy
stuff, no precious metal. The stone that sparkleth like a Diamond, yet
abides not the stroke, is a cornish or counterfeit, not a true orient Diamond.
It is artificial complexion and mere painting, not true beauty, which wears
out in a day, and is washed off with a shower. Feigned things, and false, says
the Cic. de ^s^c. l. 3. Ficta omnia tanquam slosculi decidunt, vera gloria
^adices agi^, ^que etiam propagatur.
Orator, soon fall like blossoms; true glory takes root, and spreads it
self. The truth himself, our Joh. 8 31.
Lord and Savior, makes perseverance a certain note of true Disciples: If ye
continue in my word, then are you my Disciples indeed. Would any of you know
whether he be a true son of God, and member of Christ? he can by no thing so
infallibly find it in himself, as by the gift of perseverance. This St. 1 John 2.19.
John gives for a touchstone of a true Apostle, They went out from us, but
they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would have continued
with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were
not of us. Saint Paul of a true Heb. 3.6.
member of Christ, or temple of the holy Ghost: But Christ is a son over his
own house, whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the
rejoicing of the hope firm to the end. Saint Aug. de correp. and great. c. 9.
Tunc vere sunt quod appellantur, si manse^int in co propter quod sic
appellantur.
Augustine of the true children of God: Then they are truly what they are
called (the sons of God) if they continue in that for which they are so
called.

The fourth pillar I named unto you was the power of regenerating grace, 1 Pet.
1.3, 4.
whereby we are begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of
Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and
that fades not away, reserved in heaven for us. That which is incorruptible
cannot be destroyed or perish; that which is reserved for us, cannot be taken
away from us. Now if any demand what preserves faith in the soul, in such
sort that it is never habitually lost, though the act thereof be sometimes
suspended; I answer: 1. Outwardly, the powerful ministry of the Word and
Sacraments. 2. Inwardly, renewing grace infused into the soul at the first
moment of our conversion.


This grace is by the holy Ghost termed the Jam. 1.21. Receive with meekness
the engraffed word, which is able to save your souls.
engraffed word, sometimes the 1 John 2.27. But the anointing which ye h^ve
received of him abides in you: and as it has taught you, ye shall abide in
him.
anointing that abides in us, sometimes the 1 Cor. 3.16. Know ye not that ye
are the temples of God, and that the spirit of God dwells in you?
spirit dwelling in us, sometimes a John 4.14. Whosoever drinks of the water
I shall give him, shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall
be in him a Well of water springing to everlasting life.
Well of water springing up to everlasting life, sometimes Gods 1 John 3.9.
Whosoever is borne of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him.
seed remaining in us, sometimes 1 Pet. 3.23. Being borne again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which lives and
abides for ever.
incorruptible seed: whence we may frame an argument like to that of our
Saviors to Nicodemus, As John 3.6. That which is borne of the flesh is flesh,
but that which is borne of the spirit is spirit.
that which is borne of corruptible seed, is corruptible; so that which is
borne of incorruptible seed, is incorruptible. How can he that is borne of
incorruptible and spiritual seed be corrupted, and dye spiritually? how can
he that has in his belly a Well of ever-springing water, thirst eternally?
how can he in whom the anointing S. John speaks of abides, putresie in his
sins? how can he in whom the spirit dwells, be estranged from the love of
God? how can he that is borne of God, become a child of the Devil? Saint 1
John 3.9.
John strongly argues against it: Whosoever is born of God cannot commit
sin, because he is borne of God. I conclude this argument with that daring
interrogation of Saint Aug. de bono persev. c. 7. Contra tam claram veritatis
tubam, quis voce^ ull^s aua^^t humanas?
Austin; Against so clear and loud sounding trumpet of divine truth, what man
of a sober and watchful faith will endure to hear any voices or words from
man?

The fifth pillar is Christ's prayer for the perseverance of all true believers.
The pillar is like to Jacobs ladder, that reaches from earth to heaven; and
though heaven and earth be shaken, yet this pillar will stand immovable. I
know, says Christ, that thou, John 16.23. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
whatsoever you ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
O Father, hear me always. If we obtain whatsoever we ask for Christ's
sake, shall not Christ obtain what he asks for us? If the Word of God
sustain the whole frame of nature, shall not Christ's prayer be able to support
a weak Christian? Does God hear the softest voice, and lowest sigh and groan
of his children upon earth, and will he not hear the loud cry of his Son in
his bosom in heaven? What therefore if Satan seek to winnow us like wheat?
Saint Cypr. de simpl. prelat. Triticum non rapit ventus, manes paleae
tempestate jactantur.
Cyprian bids us never to fear blowing away: It is empty chafe that is
blown away with the wind, the corn still abides on the floor. Shall Satan's
fanning be more powerful to scatter, than Christ's prayer to gather us? shall
any wind of temptation be of more force to blow us out of the heap, than the
breath of Christ himself to keep us in? Luke 21.31, 32.
Satan has sought to winnow you like wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that
thy faith fail not. Upon which words Saint Aug. de correp. and great. c. 8
Quando rogavit Christus ne Petri fides deficeret, quid aliud rogavit nisi ut
haberet in fide liberrimam, fortissimam, perseverantissimam voluntatem?
Austin thus enlarges himself: When Christ prayed for Peter, that his faith
might not fail, what did he pray for else, but that he might have a most
free, a most firm, a most constant will to continue in the faith? Yea, but it
may be excepted, that this prayer of Christ is a good protection for St. Peter,
but not for us: he is thereby secured from Apostasy, not we. Why so? Peter is
not here considered as the first precious stone in the foundation of the
heavenly Jerusalem, shining in spiritual graces above his brethren; but as one
grain or seed among others to be winnowed by Satan, which is the common case
of all the faithful: and therefore what Christ prayed for Peter, he prayed for
all of the same heap that then were, or hereafter shall be winnowed by Satan.
Thus Saint Aug. de correp. and great. c. 12. Dicente Christo rogavi pro te, ne
deficiat fides tua, intelligamus ci dictum qui aedificatur super petram, ita
homo D^^ in Domino gloriatur, non solum quia misericordiam consecutus ut esset
fidelis, sed etiam quia fides ipsa non deficit.
Austin conceives of our Saviors prayer, when Christ said, I have prayed for
thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not; let us understand it to be spoken to him
that is built upon a rock: for hereby the man of God boasts in the Lord, not
only because he has obtained mercy to become a believer, but also because
faith it self fails not. Nay, our Lord himself thus expounds himself:
John 17.20, 21, 23.
Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me
through their word, that they may be also one in us: I in them, and thou in
me, that they may be made perfect in one, etc. I will close this strain with
a quaver, like to that of Plin. in panegyr. lurat is per quem juramus.
Pliny to Trajane, What a favor is this, what security, what happiness, he
swears by whom we all swear? so may I say with far greater reason, What a
favor does God vouchsafe unto us, what security does he give us, what a
happiness is it for us, Orat is per quem oramus; He prays for us by whom
we pray, nay, to whom we pray: by whom we pray as our Mediator; to whom we
pray as God, and in whose name we obtain all that we pray for?

The sixth pillar is a pillar of brass, as strong as a castle of Diamond, to
secure the person of the faithful, the safeguard of Gods protection. This
pillar is thus erected by Saint 1 Pet. 1.4, 5.
Peter, Those that are begotten again to a lively hope, are kept by the power
of God through faith unto salvation; and therefore cannot be drawn away through
infidelity to perdition. The Patrons of the apostasy of Saints cannot infringe
this argument, unless they could weaken or shorten the arm of the Almighty,
who is 2 Timothy 1.12.
able to keep that which is committed unto him against that day; and not able
only, but 2 These. 3.3.
faithful also to establish us, and keep us from evil, and confirm us, not
for a time only, but to the end, that we may be 1 Cor. 1.8.
blameless in the day in the Lord Jesus: which, according to his gracious
promises, he most certainly performs two manner of ways: 1. Partly by
arming us continually with new strength of grace to resist temptation, in what
kind soever. 2. Partly by inhibiting and restraining the assaults themselves,
both in respect of 1. The violence, 2. The continuance of them.



To the first point Saint Greg. l. 28. moral in Job c. 7. Novit pro custodia
nostra restringere quod contra nos egredi pro justitiae ^xercitio permittit, ut
saeviens nos dilua^ procella, non mergat.
Gregory speaks pertinently: Our gracious God for our health and safety
knows how to keep that within bounds, which he suffers in justice to go
out against us, in such sort that the raging storm shall wash us all over, but
shall not drown us.

The second point Saint Ambr. comment. in 1 Corinthians. 10. Non plus permittitur
ei imponi, quam scitur far posse, ut quarto die pati non permittatur, qui
scitur ultra triduum non posse tolerare.
Ambrose fully hitteth: God, says he, does so proportion the burden to our
shoulders, that he suffers not more to be laid upon any, than he knows
may be borne, so that he permits not a man to be in durance the fourth day,
whose patience he knows cannot hold out beyond the third. The Apostles words
reach home to both: 1 Cor. 10.13.
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are
able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be
able to bear it: Hoc est scutum Vulcanicum, This is armor of proof indeed
against darts, arrows, bullets, swords, or push of pike. If we shall never be
tempted above our strength, we shall always be strengthened above temptation;
and consequently, never be overcome of it. Plin l. 12. not. hist. c. 9.
Fluctibus pulsatae resistunt immotae, quin and pleno aestu operiuntur,
apparetque argumentis asperitate aquarum illas ali.
Pliny writes of a strange kind of trees growing in the red sea, which being
beat upon by the waves stand immovable, yea sometimes when in a full sea they
are covered over with water: and it appears by many arguments, that they are
bettered by the roughness of the waters; even so a Christian planted in the
red sea by faith in Christ's blood, resists all the waves of temptation, and
the more he is beat upon, yea and overwhelmed also sometimes with the billows
of troubles and afflictions, the better he thriveth spiritually in grace.

The seventh and last pillar to uphold the doctrine delivered, is the judgment
of the ancient Church, upon record in the authentical writings of the ancient
Fathers that flourished within six hundred years after Christ. I will only
allege such passages as upon this occasion I had time to examine.

Origin for antiquities sake shall begin the verdict. It is the manner of the
Scripture to begin with those things which are sad and dreadful, and to end
with those things which are cheerful and comfortable: God says not, Orig. in
Jer. homil. 1. Non dicitur vivificabo and occidam; sed occidam and vivificabo:
impossible est enim quod Deus semel vivificavit, ab eodem ipso vel ab alio
occidi.
I will make alive, and I will kill; but I will kill, and I will make alive:
for it is impossible that what God once quickneth (he means by spiritual
grace) should ever be killed or destroyed, either by himself or any other.

Saint Cyprian secondeth Origin, who will have Cyp. de simpl. prelat. Nemo
aestimet bonos de Ecclesia posse discedere: triticum non rapit ventus, nec
arborem solida radice fundatam procella subvertit.
no man entertain any such thought, as if good men and true believers ever
revolted finally from the Church: Let no man conceive, says he, that good men
can depart from the Church: the wind blows not away the wheat, neither does
the storm overthrow a tree sound at root; they are like empty chafe which are
scattered away with a whirlewind, and weak and rotten trees which are blown
down in a tempest.

Saint Chrysostom joyneth upon the same issue, commenting upon the words of
Saint Paul (by whom also we have access by faith unto this grace wherein we
stand) thus, He says well the grace wherein we stand: the phrase is worth the
noting; for such indeed is the nature of Gods grace, Chrysostom. homil. in ep. ad
Romans c. 5. (...).
it is stable and constant, it has no end, it knows no period, but proceeds
always from lesser to greater matters. Those whom grace makes to stand and
grow continually, cannot fall totally nor finally.

Saint Ambrose accords with Saint Chrysostom in his observation upon the
second Epistle to the Corinthians, chap. 3.3. The words of Saint Paul are,
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered
by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in
tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart. St. Amo Comment. in 2.
Cor. 3.3. Nunc legem veterem pulsat, ^uae p^imum data in lapideis tabulis
abolita est, fractis tabulis sub M^nte a Mose: nunc autem lex in animo
scribitur, hoc est, in cord, non per calamum, sed per spiritum, quia fides
aeterna res est, a spiritu scribitu, ut mane^t.
Ambrose his note upon this place is; Here he touches upon or strikes at the
old Law, which first being given in tables of stone, is abolished, the tables
being broken under the Mount by Moses: but now the Law is written in the mind,
not with a quill or pen, but by the spirit; because faith is an eternal thing,
it is written by the spirit, that it may abide or still continue.

Saint Austin and Saint Gregory clearly conclude on our side, by excluding all
from the number of Christ's Disciples, and Sons of God, and Saints, whose
revolt and apostasy proves their hypocrisy. Saint Aug de correp. and great. ^
9. Qui non habent perseve^ antiam, cut non ve^e Discipuli Christi, ita nec vere
Filii Dei fue^unt, etiam quando esse videbantur. and ita vocabantur.
Austin speaks definitively: Those who have not the gift of perseverance, as
they are not truly Christ's Disciples, so neither were they ever truly the
Sons of God, no not when they seemed to be so.

And Saint Greg. moral. in Job l. 34. c 13. Aurum quod pravis diaboli
persuasio^ibus sterni sicut lutum potuerit, aurum ante oculos Dei nunquam fuit;
and qui seduci quandoque non reversuri possunt, qua i^habitam sanctitate ante
oculos hominum videantur amittere, sed eam ante oculos Dei nunquam habucrunt.
Gregory is as peremptory: It may, says he, peradventure trouble a weak
Christian, that this Leviathan has such power that he can trample gold under
his feet like dirt; that is, subject unto himself men shining in the
brightness of holiness, by defiling them with vices: but we have an answer
ready at hand, that the gold, which by wicked persuasions of the Devil can be
laid under his feet like dirt, was never gold in the sight of God; and they who
may be so seduced that they never return again, may seem to lose the habit
of sanctity before the eyes of men, but before the eyes of God they never were
endued with any such habit.

You see with a little blowing what a clear light the smoking flax in my
Text gives to this Theological verity (viz.) that regenerating grace and
justifying faith cannot be utterly lost, or totally extinct. Feel, I beseech
you now, what warmth it yields to our cold affections, and sometimes benumbed
consciences: and first to our cold affections. Is the ointment of the Spirit so
precious, that the least drop of it saves the life of the soul? Is the least
seed of the Word incorruptible? Is the smallest spark of true charity
unquenchable? Cannot justifying faith be ever lost; nor the state of grace
forfeited? Why then do we not strive for this state? why do we not, with the
rich Merchant in the Gospel, sell all that we have to gain this pearl of
faith? When we have got it, why do we not more highly value it in our selves
and others? Other pearls and precious stones adorn but the body, or cover
some imperfection in it; this beautifieth the soul, and covers all the
skarres and deformities therein. Other Jewels, be they never so rich, are but
presents for earthly Princes; but with this pearl the King of Heaven is taken,
and it is the price of that Kingdom. Other pearls have their estimation from
men; but men have their estimation from this pearl. Other Jewels when they are
got may be lost, and that very easily; but this Jewel of faith, if it be
true and not counterfeit, after it is once gotten can never be lost. All the
thoughts of worldly men are employed, all their cares taken up, all their time
bestowed, all their means spent in purchasing, or some way procuring unto
themselves a fortune (as they term it) as a beneficial office, or an estate
of land of inheritance, or lease for term of years or lives; all which are
yet subject to a thousand casualties. Why do they not rather look after and
labor for the state of grace, which is past all hazard, being assured to us
by the handwriting of God, and the seal of his Spirit? An estate not for
term of years, but for eternity; an estate not of land upon earth, but of an
inheritance immortal, undefiled, reserved in heaven; an estate which cannot be
spoiled or wasted by hostile invasion, nor wrung from us by power, nor won by
law, nor morgaged for debt, nor impaired by public calamity, nor endangered by
change of Princes, nor voided by death it self. S. Chrysostom. in c. 5. ad Romans
(...).
Chrysostom his eloquence exspatiateth in this field: A man, says he, has
received rule glory, and power here, but enjoys it not perpetually, but very
soon falls from it. For though no man take it from him; death will quite strip
him of it. But the gifts of God are not such, or like to the gifts of Princes.
For neither man, nor time, nor circumstances of actions, nor reason of state,
nor the Devil himself, nay, nor death, can deprive him of them, or put him by
them.

You see how the smoking flax being blown, kindles the heat of our zeal,
and enflameth us on the purchasing the estate of grace by the price of Christ's
blood. Feel now (I beseech you) in the second place, what warmth it yields
to a benumbed conscience, and a soul frozen in the dregs of sin. That the
bruised reed shall not be broken, nor smoking flax be quenched, is a
doctrine of singular comfort and use; yet must it be very discreetly handled,
and seasonably applied to such and such only as are heavy laden, and bruised
with the weight and sense of their sin, and through inward or outward
affliction smoke for them: and are, as Arboreus speaks, extinctioni vicini,
near to be utterly quenched through inundation of sorrow. To tell a
presumptuous sinner in the height of his pride, and heat of his lust, and top
and top gallant of his vain glory, Rectus in Curia.
that he stands straight in the Court of heaven, is in the state of grace, and
can never fall away from it, or become a castaway, is to minister hot potions
to a man in a burning fever, which is the ready way to stifle him, and as soon
to rid him of his life as of his pain: hot cordials and strong waters are to
be given in a languishing fit, and a cold sweat, when the patient is in danger
of swouning. It is the part, says S. Aug. de bono persev. c. 22. Dolosi vel
imperiti medici est, etiam utile medicamentum sic alligare, ut aut non prosit,
aut etiam obsit.
Austin, of a deceitful or unskilful Physician or Chyrurgian, to lay a
wholesome salve or plaster so on, that it do no good, nay, rather that it do
hurt. Having therefore made a most sovereign salve out of the words of my Text
for the sores of a wounded conscience, I am now to show you how to use, and
when to apply it; viz. in deliquio spiritus, in a spiritual desertion or
dereliction. As we sometimes feel in our bodies (...), deliquium animae, a
trance and utter failing of the vital spirits; so is there also in the soul
of a faithful Christian sometimes deliquium spiritus, an utter fainting and
failing in all the motions and operations of grace; when God either to humble
him, that he be not proud of his favors, or to make him more earnestly desire,
and highly esteem the comforts of the Gospel, withdraws the spirit from him
for a season, during which time of spiritual desertion he lies as it were in
a swoune, feeling no motion of the spirit, as it were the pulse-beating, taking
in no breath of life by hearing the Word, nor letting it out by prayer and
thanksgiving, void of all sense of faith and life of hope, ready every hour
to give up the holy Ghost. In this extremity we are to stay him with flagons,
and comfort him with the apples in my Text, and as his fit of despair more and
more grows on him, in this sort and order to minister and give them unto him.

1. When he lamenteth in the bitterness of his soul after this manner: There
was a time when the face of God shined upon me, and I saw his blessing upon
all that I set my hand unto; but now he has hid his face from me; and shut up
his loving kindness in displeasure; he blows upon all the fruits of my
labors, and nothing prospers with me, my estate decays, and my friends
fail me, and afflictions and calamities come thick upon me, like S. Bas. de
patientia, conc. 13. (...) Job 1.14, 16, 17, 18.
waves of the sea, riding one on the neck of the other, or like Jobs
messengers, one treading on the heels of the other, and the latter bringing
still worse tidings than the former. Apply thou this remedy: Many Psalm. 34.18,
19. Matthew 9.12. 1 Timothy 1.15.
are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them
all: he keeps all his bones, so that not one of them is broken.

2. If he go on in his mournful ditty, saying; I am far from being
righteous: therefore this comfort belongs not unto me. Apply thou this
salve: The whole need not the Physician, but they that are sick. This is a
faithful saying, and by all means worthy to be received, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners. Matthew. 9.13.
I am not come, says Christ, to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

3. If he reply: Oh but I cannot repent; for I am not able to master mine own
corruptions: Vitiis meis impar sum; I cannot shake off the sin that hangs on
so fast. I am like one in the mudde, who the more he struggleth with his feet
to get out, the deeper he sinketh, and sticks faster in the mire. Apply this
recipe: Yet be of good comfort, because thou delightest in the Law of God
touching the inward man: thou strivest against all sin, and because thou
can not get the upper hand of some of thy bosom corruptions, thy life is
grievous unto thee. Thou cryest with the holy Apostle: Romans 7.24.
O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? Thou
hungerest and thirstest after righteousness: and, Blessed are they which
hunger and thirst for righteousness; Matthew. 5.6.
for they shall be filled.

4. If he sink deeper into the gulf of desperation, and say: I feel no such
hunger nor thirst in me. Custom in sin has drawn a kall over my
conscience, and I am not now sensible of any incision. Reach thy hand to him,
and support him with this comfort: Be of good cheer (good brother) for it is
certain thou have some sense, because thou art sensible of thy stupidity, and
mournest in thy prayers, and art vexed for this thy dullness: and blessed are
they that mourn, Matthew. 5.4.
for they shall be comforted.

5. If he yet sink deeper and lower, crying: Alas, I cannot mourn, my hard
heart will not relent, my flinty eyes will not yield a tear for my sins: what
hope then for me? Answer him, great; as great as thy sorrow, which is by so
much the fuller, because it has no vent. None grieveth more truly, Hierom.
Tom. 1. epist. Mutus and clinguis ne hoc quidem habens, ut rogare possit, hoc
magis rogat quod rogare non potest.
than he who grieveth because he cannot grieve. A man that is borne dumb, or
has his tongue cut out, when he makes offer to speak, moving his lips, but
is not able to bring forth a word, beggeth after a more effectual manner, even
because he cannot utter his prayer by speech, his very dumbness pleads for
him; so the sorrow of a penitent sinner, which feign would express it self by
tears, but cannot, which rendeth the heart continually, and makes it
evaporate into secret sighs, best expresses it self to him of whom the
Prophet speaks: Psalm. 38.9.
Lord, thou know all my desires, and my groaning is not hid from thee.

6. If he sink so low, that the pit is ready to shut her mouth over him, and he
being now even swallowed up in the gulf of despair, breathe out his last
sigh, and roares most fearfully, to the great dis-heartening of all that come
about him, saying: I have no touch of remorse, no sense of joy, no apprehension
of faith, no comfort of hope; My wounds stink, and are putrefied, and all the
balm of Gilead cannot now cure me. The Spirit is utterly extinct in me; and
therefore my case desperate. In this extreme fit of despair give him this
cordial out of the words of my Text: Have thou never felt any remorse of
conscience in all thy life? Wast thou never pricked in heart at the Sermon of
some Peter? Were thou never ravished with joy, when the general pardon of all
thy sins has been exemplified to thee in the application of the promises of
the Gospel, and sealed to thee by the Sacrament? Have thou never had any
sensible token of Gods love? I know thou have, and thou acknowledgest as much
in confessing amongst other thy sins thine intolerable ingratitude toward the
Lord that bought thee: then be yet of good comfort, the flax yet smoaketh,
the fire is not clean out; thou have lost the sense, but not the essence of
faith. Thou art cast out of Gods favor in thy apprehension, not in truth. Thou
art but in a swoune, thy soul is in thee. Thou discernest no sign or motion
of life in thee, but others may. Thy conscience will bear thee record, that
sometimes thou did truly believe, and true faith cannot be lost. Gods
covenant of grace is immovable, his affection is unchangeable, he whom God
loves, he loves to the end; and he whom God loves to the end, must needs
be saved in the end: and so I end.

And thus have I blown the smoking flax in my Text, and you see what light
it affords to our understanding, and warmth to our consciences: what
remains but that I pray to God to kindle in us this light, and inflame this
heat more and more, to revive the spirit of the humble, to cheer up the
drouping looks, and cure the wounded consciences, and heal the broken hearts
of them that mourn for their sins, that is, to bear up the bruised and
bowed reed that it be not broken, and revive and kindle again the dying lamp,
that it be not quite extinguished. So be it, O Father of mercy, for the
passion of thy Son, through the Spirit of grace: To whom, three persons and
one God, be ascribed all honor, glory, praise, and thanksgiving now and for
ever. Amen.

THE STILL VOICE. A Sermon preached before the high Commission in his Graces
Chapel at Lambeth, November. 20. 1619. THE THIRD SERMON.
MATTHEW. 12.19. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any man hear his
voice in the streets.


Most REVEREND, etc.
IN these words we have set before us in the person of our Savior an Idea and
perfect image of meekness; the characters whereof are three: 1. Calmness in
affection, He will not strive. 2. Softness and lowness in speech, He will
not cry, etc. 3. Innocence in action, He will not break, etc.


1. Impatience is contentious, He will not strive.

2. Contention is clamorous, He will not cry.

3. Clamor is querulous, No man shall hear his voice in the street.

If it be objected that he did strive, and that with such vehemence that he
sweat blood: and that he did cry, and that very loud; for as we read ( Hebr.
5.7.) he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears,
unto him that was able to save him from death: and that his voice was heard in
the streets; when he stood up in the last day, the great day of the Feast, John
7.37.
and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink: we
need not fly to Anselme and Carthusians allegory for the matter, who thus
gloss upon the words of my Text: His voice shall not be heard in the streets,
that is, in the broad way that leads to destruction. Such Delian diverse may
spare their pains: for the objections are but shallow, and admit of a very
facile solution without any forced trope. He will not strive, viz. in revenge,
but in love; he will not cry, in anger, but in zeal; neither shall his voice
be heard in the street, viz. vox querelae, but doctrinae; no voice of
complaint, but of instruction or comfort. So that the three members in this
sentence, are like the three strings in a Dulcimer, all Unisons. Wherefore in
the handling of this Text, I will strike them all together. Seneca in his books
of clemency, Cambden. hist. Reg. Eliz. Seneca l. 1. de clem. Conditum, imo
constrictum apud te ferrum, sit summa parsimonia etiam vilissimi sanguinis,
humili loco positis litigare, and in rixam procurrere liberius est, leves inter
pares ictus sunt, regi quoque vociferatio, verborumque intemperantia, non ex
Majestate est.
which Queen Elizabeth so highly esteemed, that she gave them the next place
to the holy Scriptures, reads a divine Lecture to a Prince in these words: Let
thy sword not only be put up in the sheath, but also tied fast in it; be
sparing of the meanest and basest blood. It is for men of lower condition to
fall into quarrels and strifes, equals may exchange blows one with another
without much danger; it stands not with the Majesty of a Prince to engage
himself in any quarrel or fight: because he has no equal to contend with
him: so far ought it to be from a Prince to brawle, or wrangle, that the
straining of his voice is unbefitting him upon any occasion whatsoever. What
the wise Philosopher prescribes to a good Prince, the Prophet Esaias describes
in our King Messiah, who was so mild in his disposition, that he was never
stirred to passion; so gentle in his speech, that he never strained his voice
in choler; so innocent in his actions, that he never put forth his strength to
hurt any. We read in the book of 1. Kin. 19.11, 12.
Kings, that there was a mighty wind, but God was not in the wind: and after
the wind an earthquake, but God was not in the earthquake: and after the
earthquake a fire, but God was not in the fire: and after the fire a still
small voice, in which God was. There God was in the still voice; but here the
Evangelist out of the Prophet informs us, that there was a small still voice
in the Lord our Savior Jesus Christ. For he strove not, nor cried, nor was his
voice heard in the streets. A still small voice naturally produces no echo.
For as a ball laid softly on the ground boundeth not up again; but if it be
struck down with a vehement stroke rises from the ground again and again; so
a low and whispering voice, which gently moves the air, is not returned
again by an echo: but a strong and a loud sound, which forcibly smites the
air, is reverberated from mountains and rocks by a double or treble echo. Yet
here a still small voice is returned by an echo. For the words which I have
read unto you in S. Matthew are no other than the echo of the voice of the
Prophet Esaias. As Esaias of all the Prophets is most Evangelicall, that is, most
plainly delivers the story of Christ his life and death by way of prediction;
so S. Matthew of all the four Evangelists is most Prophetical, that is,
alleges most passages out of the Prophets in his Gospel. None so frequently
inserteth testimonies out of the Old Testament into his story as he, which he
so pertinently applies, that in his Gospel every man may discern the truth of
that observation of the Ancients (viz.) that the New Testament is veiled in the
Old, and the Old is revealed in the New. The Prophets and Evangelists being the
organs of the same holy Spirit, like diverse instruments of music playing the
same tune, though in different keys. Or rather like opposite looking-glasses,
reflecting the same image one upon the other, to wit, the brightness of God his
glory, Hebr. 1.2.
and the express image of his person. Or like thick and bright clouds on both
sides of the Sun, which receiving the beams thereof, and with them an impression
of the similitude of that Prince of the celestial lights, reflect the same one
upon another, and make as if there were diverse Suns in the sky, which are
indeed but parelii pictures and representations of the self same Sun,
Malach. 3.1. Esa. 42.1, 2, 3.
the Sun of righteousness. The Prophet Esaias points to the Messiah, as it
were afar off, saying, Behold the servant of God whom he upholdeth, his
Elect, in whom his soul delights, upon whom he has put his spirit, he shall
bring forth judgment to the Gentiles; he shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause
his voice to be heard in the streets; a bruised reed shall he not break, and
smoking flax shall he not quench, till he bring forth judgment unto truth.
The Evangelist viewing Christ near at hand, finds all those marks in him,
by which the Prophet describes him. Which you shall plainly descry, if you
cast back your eye on the story set down a little above my Text. There shall
you find Christ stretching out his hand of mercy to a withered hand, and
healing it on the Sabbath day, and the Pharisees murmuring at it, and
conspiring against him for it. Against whom notwithstanding he made no
forcible resistance, nor so much as opened his lips, but giving place to their
wrath, leaves that country; and though he were so ill requited for his good
deeds, and miraculous cures, yet he goes about still doing good in all places,
healing their sick, curing their blind, lame, and deaf, and withal charging
them, that they should not make him known, That it might be fulfilled, says
the Evangelist, etc. That it was fulfilled which God spoke by the Prophet Esaias,
and how, it will evidently appear, by comparing the predictions of the Prophet
with the history of the Evangelist: Behold my servant, says the Prophet. The
son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, Matthew. 20.28.
Luke 23.35. Mat. 3. ver. ult. Luke 2.32.
says the Evangelist. Mine Elect, says the Prophet. Christ the chosen of God,
says the Evangelist. In whom I delight, says the Prophet. In whom I am well
pleased, says the Evangelist. He shall bring judgment to the Gentiles, says
the Prophet. A light to lighten the Gentiles, says the Evangelist. He shall
not strive, says the Prophet He did not strive, says the Evangelist; neither
here with the Scribes and Pharisees, nor in the garden with them that sought
his life; but contrariwise, when St. Peter drew a sword in his defense, Matthew.
16.52, 53.
and struck off a servant of the high Priests ear, he rebuked him, saying,
Put up thy sword, think thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
shall presently give me more than twelve legions of Angels? but how then shall
the Scripture be fulfilled? He shall not cry, Mat. 27.14. Acts 8.32.
nor lift up his voice, says the Prophet. He was silent, and answered not a
word, says the Evangelist, but was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a
Lamb dumb before the shearer. A bruised reed shall he not break, says the
Prophet. The Evangelist testifies he did not. For the people which lay maimed
and diseased, like bruised reeds upon the ground, he went not over, but raised
them up; and the Scribes and Pharisees, whose malice smoaked against him, he
did not destroy, or extinguish, when he might as easily have done it, as tread
out the week of a candle on the ground with his shoe. For he came not to
quench, but to kindle; not to destroy, but to save; not to lance, but to
plaster; not to revenge, but to reconcile; not to punish, but to suffer; not to
break the bruised reed, but to be beaten and bruised with reeds and whips, yea
and to be broken also upon the cross.

You have heard how this Text is inferred. Now in the second place listen what
it infers both against the Jew, and for the Christian.

1. It infers for the reproof of the Jew, that the first coming of the
King Messiah was to be private and silent, without any outward pomp or great
noise.

2. For the instruction of Christians, that the members ought to be
conformable to the head, and frame their dispositions to his most sweet and
gracious temper.

3. For the comfort of all, that the Judge of all flesh is meek, mild, and
merciful to all that bow to him, or fall down before him like bruised reeds.

First, we have here the character of the true Messiah, and the manner (if I
may so speak) of his stealing into the world at his first coming. Wherein
judicious Calvin wills us to observe the difference between the Messiah and
other Kings and Princes. They when they ride in progress, send their
Harbingers before to take up lodgings, and Martials to make way, and when they
enter any City, it is with great noise and tumult, ringing of Bells, sound of
Trumpets, peales of Ordnance, rattling of Spears, clattering of Coaches, and
clamours of the People; but our King, the Prince of peace, entered the world in
a far different manner. As in the building of the material Temple there was not
heard the noise of any tool; so neither in the building of the spiritual
Temple, I mean the Temple of Christ's body, and setting it up, was there any
noise or sound heard. John 2.21.
This privacy of his first entry into the world pleases not the carnal Jew,
whose thoughts are all upon a temporal Monarch, that should buy out Croesus
his wealth, and obscure Solomon in all his royalty, and extend his dominion as
far as the Sun casts his beams. No Messiah will please him, but such a
one as comes in with great state and pomp: yet was Christ his quiet seizing
upon his Kingdom most correspondent to the prediction of the Prophet, Psalm.
72.6.
He shall come down like rain into a fleece of wool, or upon the mowne
grass, that is, not heard, and most agreeable to his title and kingdom. For
what more consentaneous to reason, than that the Prince of peace should enter
upon his Kingdom of grace in a quiet and silent manner. Had he come into the
world like the two Scipio's, which were termed fulmina belli, with thundering
and lightening, or like the Roman Emperors, or the grand Signiours, in the
most pompous manner, with greatest ostentation of wealth, and pride of worldly
honor, more feared he might have been, but less loved: there had been more
state in his coming, but less merit for us; and consequently, less true
comfort in it. The note that we are to take from it is, That Christ's Kingdom
is not of this World: And the use we are to make of it is, Not to look for
great estates, large revenues, or high preferments here; but to be content with
a competency of means, not without a liberal allowance, sometimes of
afflictions, crosses, and troubles. For delicate members, and such as must be
continually wrapped in soft raiment, and that can endure no hardness, sort not
well with a head crowned with thorns. By the Law, The feathers of such fowls
as had been sacrificed, were cast in locum cinerum, into the place of ashes.
What are all the pompes and vanities of this world, but like beautiful
feathers? Projiciamus ergo in locum cinerum; Let us therefore strip us of them,
and by true mortification cast them into the place of ashes, especially in this
time of sorrow and penance, when sackcloth is or should be in fashion for
apparel, and ashes for couches. Upon which when God sees us, he will have
compassion on us, and give us beauty for ashes, and the garment of gladness
for the spirit of heaviness. 2 Cor. 5.7. Coloss. 3.3, 4.
As we are Christians we walk by faith, and not by sight; our life is hid with
Christ in God: and when Christ which is our life shall appear, then shall we
also appear with him in glory.

Secondly, we have here the picture of meekness in the pattern of all
perfection, Matthew. 21.5.
Christ Jesus, drawn to the life for our imitation. What the Prophet Zachary
foretold concerning the disposition and gracious temper of the Messiah to
come, saying: Tell the daughter of Sion, behold, the King comes unto thee
meek, Zach. 9.9.
etc. the same the Evangelist confirms through the whole Gospel, by the
speeches and silence, actions and passions, life and death of the Lord of life.
To begin with his speeches, if ever that Eulogue of the Greek Poet, (...). or
the like of the Latin; Vernas afflat ab ore rosas, were verified: if ever the
tongue of any dropped honey, and his breath were as sweet and savoury as Roses
in the Spring, it was certainly our Redeemers, who is that he spoke, and
speaks always that he is, the Word of God. The Father is as the mouth, the
holy Spirit the breath, and Christ the word. Hear, I beseech you, verba Verbi,
the words of the Word of life; Come unto me all that are heavy laden, and I
will ease you. Son, be of good comfort, thy faith has made thee whole. I
came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. The son of man
came not to destroy, but to save. Go in peace, thy sins be forgiven thee.
And, Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the Kingdom prepared for you
before the foundation of the world was laid, etc. Yea, but these speeches he
uttered to penitent sinners, or such as sued to him for favor and mercy; how
did he demean himself toward those uncivil and inhumane Samaritans, who
denied him lodging? Against whom James and John, the sons of thunder, were so
incensed, that they would have called down fire from heaven to destroy them,
by the example of Elias. Does he curse them? does he upbraid ingratitude, and
inhospitality unto them: nay, rather he rebukes his Disciples, whom zeal and
love transported too far, and by telling them, they knew not of what spirit
they were, Luke 9.55.
he showed apparently what spirit he was, who when the Scribes and Pharisees
laid Sorcery and Necromancy to his charge, saying: Say we not well thou art a
Samaritane, and have a Devil? he delivered them not to the Devil, as they
deserved for this their blasphemous slander, nor sharply reproves them; John
8.49.
but mildly answers, I have not a Devil, but I honor my Father, and ye
have dishonored me. Perhaps he pitied their ignorance, or had respect to the
dignity and place of the Scribes and Pharisees, who bare the greatest sway
among the people, may some say. But what was there in his own Disciple Judas,
that he should grace that damned caitiffe, that traitorous servant, that son
of perdition, with the title of Friend, when he came to play the most
unfriendly and ungrateful part that ever was acted, even to betray his Lord
and Master? Friend, wherefore art thou come? Matthew. 26.50.
do thou betray the son of man with a kiss? I have spoken of the speeches
of our Savior, let me not pass in silence his meek silence, when he was led
as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearers, so opened he
not his mouth. When he was falsely slandered in the Judgment seat, shamefully
handled in the Hall, most contumeliously reviled, and cruelly tortured upon the
cross. When the Judge of all flesh was condemned, the beauty of Heaven spit
upon, the King of glory crowned with thorns, the Maker of the world made a
spectacle of misery to the whole world. When his Disciples forsook him, his
own Nation accused him, the Judge condemned him, the servants buffeted him,
the soldiers deluded him, the people exclaimed against him, the Scribes and
Pharisees scoffed at him, the executioners tormented him in all parts of his
body. When the Stars were confounded with shame, the Elements troubled, Cypr.
de bon. pat. Cum confunderentur sidera, elementa turbentur, contremiscat terra,
nox diem claudat, sol ne Judaeorum facinus aspicere cogatur radios subtrahat,
ille non loquitur, nec movetur, nec Majestatem suam sub ipsa saltem morte
profitetur; O qualis and quanta est Christi patientia! qui adoratur in coelis,
nondum vindicatur in terris.
the Earth trembled, the Stones clave with indignation, the veil of the Temple
rent it self, the Heaven mourned in sables, the Sun, that he might not
behold such outrage done upon so sacred a person, drew in his beams. He who
suffers all this quatcheth not, stirs not, nor discovers his divine
Majesty, no not when death approached. When all insensible creatures seemed to
be sensible of the injury offered their Maker; he who feels all, seems to
be insensible. For he makes no resistance at all, and though he were
omnipotent, yet his patience overcame his omnipotency, and even to this day
restrains his justice from taking full revenge of them who were the authors
of his death, and of those who since crucify again the Lord of life, and
trample under their feet the blood of the Covenant, as a profane thing. Whose
thoughts are not swallowed up in admiration at this, that he who is adored in
heaven, is not yet revenged upon the earth? You see meekness in his passions,
behold now this virtue expressed to the life in his life and actions Actions, I
say, whether natural or miraculous, so indeed they are usually distinguished;
albeit Christ's miraculous actions were natural in him, proceeding from his
divine nature: and most of his natural actions, as they are called, proceeding
from his humane nature, were in him wonderful and miraculous. For instance, to
weep is a most natural action; but to weep in the midst of his triumph, and
that for their ruin, who were the cause of all his woe: to shed tears for
them, who thirsted after his blood, was after a sort miraculous. Who ever did
the like? Indeed we read that Marcellus wept over Syracuse, and Scipio over
Carthage, and Titus over Jerusalem, as our Savior did, but the cause was far
different: They shed tears for them whose blood they were to shed; but our
Savior for them who were ready to shed his. Luke 19.41.
His bowels earned for them who thought it long till they had pierced his heart
with a lance. When the high Priest commanded Paul to be smote on the face, he
rebuked him, saying: The Lord shall smite thee thou painted wall: Acts 23 3.
but when the Lord himself was smitten by the high Priests servant, he falls
not foul upon him, but returns this mild answer: If I have done evil, John
18.23.
bear witness of the evil; but if I have done well, why strikest thou me?
The servant thinks much to endure that from the Master, which the Master
endures from the servant. The Apostles, on whom the Spirit descended in the
likeness of fiery tongues, were often hot, and inflamed with wrath against the
enemies of God, and brought down fearful judgments upon them; but our
Savior, on whom the Spirit descended in the likeness of a Dove, never hurt
any by word or deed. 2 Kin. 5.27. Matthew. 8.2. Luke 4.27. and 17.12. Acts 13.11.
Acts 5.5.10.
Eliah inflicted leprosy upon Gehazi by miracle. Christ by miracle cleansed
diverse lepers. Saint Paul took away sight from Elymas. Christ by miracle
restored sight to many. Saint Peter miraculously with a word struck Ananias
and Sapphira down dead. Christ by miracle raised many from death, insomuch that
his very enemies gave this testimony of him: Mark 7 37.
He has done all well, giving to the lame feet, to the maimed strength, to
the dumb speech, to the deaf ears, to the blind sight, to the sick health,
to the dead life, to the living everlasting joy and comfort.

I have proposed unto you a notable example, shall I need to put to spurs of
art to prick on your desires to follow it? the example is our Savior, and the
virtue exemplified in him meekness. How excellent must the picture be which is
set in so rich a frame? such a virtue were to be imitated in any person; such a
person to be imitated in any virtue: how much more such a virtue in such a
person? It is hard to say, whether ought to be the stronger motive unto us to
follow meekness, either because it is the prince of virtues, or the virtue of
our Prince, whose style is Princeps pacis.

Where the prince is the Prince of peace, and the kingdom the Kingdom of
grace, and the law the Law of love, they must certainly be of a mild and
loving disposition that are capable of preferment in it. If the Spirit be an
ointment, as S. 1. John 2.20. But you have an ointment from the Holy One, and
you know all things.
John calls it, it must needs supple. If grace be a dew, it cannot but
moisten and soften the heart, and make it like Gedeons fleece, Judges 6.37.
which was full of moisture when all the ground about it was dry. What can be
said more in the commendation of any virtue than meekness; and of it, than
this, that God commands it in his Word, Christ patterneth it in his life and
death, the holy Spirit produces it in our hearts, our very nature enclineth us
to it, and our condition requires it of us? No virtue so generally commended
as meekness. Follow after righteousness, 1 Timothy 6.11.
godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness, be no brawler, Tit. 3.2.
but gentle, showing all meekness to all men. Walk worthy of the vocation
whereunto you are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with
long-suffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace. James 3.17, 18.
The wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and
easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, and the fruit of
righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. No fruit of the
spirit so sweet and pleasant as this: as on the contrary, no fruit of the flesh
so tart and bitter as jealousy and wrath, which God curses by the mouth of
Genes 40.7. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their rage, for it
was cruel.
Jacob; but blesses meekness by the mouth of our Savior, Matthew. 5.5. Blessed
are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. The earth was cursed before it
brought forth thorns, and thistles, and briars, which are good for nothing but
to be burned. Wherefore let us hearken to the counsel of St. Cypr. de zelo
and b^^ore Evellamus spinas de cordibus, ut d^^minicum semen nos fertili fruge
locupletet.
Cyprian: Let us weed out of our souls envy, wrath, and jealousy, and other
stinging and pricking passions. And of the Apostle: Let no root of Heb. 12.15.
Looking diligently, -- lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you.
bitterness remain in us, that we may receive with meekness the engraffed
Word, which is able to save our souls, James 1.21. Our carnal lusts are like
so many serpents, and of all, wrath is the most fiery, which will set all in a
combustion, if it be not either quenched by the tears of repentance, or
slacked by the infusion of divine grace, especially the grace of meekness,
which in the heart is tenderness, in the disposition softness, in the
affections temper, in the mind calmness, in the carriage sweetness.
Aristotle briefly defines it, Rhet. l. 2. (...).
the Bridle of wrath; which because it is a passion of all other most
headstrong, it requires both a strong curb, and a skillful rider, for whose
direction the Spirit of God in holy Scripture has set down diverse rules.

The first rule is, not to be suddenly or easily provoked. This is laid down
for us by the Apostle St. James, Let every man be swift to hear, James 1.19.
slow to speak, slow to wrath. To follow this rule, it will be behoofull
according to the advice of Hyper. citat. a Lips. Comment. in Sen. de clem. l.
1. (...), etc.
Hyperides, to prevent the occasion of quarrels, and stop the passages of
wrongs, to nip the seeds of discords, because if anger take root, like an
inveterate disease, it will hardly be cured. Senec. l. 1. de clem. In primis
finibus hostis arcendus est; nam cum portis se intulit, modum a captivis non
capit.
Seneca strikes the same note, though on a different string: Above all things,
says he, keep the enemy from entering the City: for if he once thrust his
head into the gate, he will give thee the law, and not take it from thee. Ovid
gives it as a character of a gracious Prince, to be tardus ad iram; Slow to
wrath. Certainly, it is no strong piece that will suddenly be out of frame:
the bone was never well set, that easily slips out of joint. A man full of
juice and sap of grace is like green wood, which is long before it be kindled:
they who easily take fire, seem rather to be anointed with brimstone, than the
sweet ointment of the spirit above mentioned.

The second rule is, to tolerate some infirmities in others, as likewise others
tolerate us in many things: for, as St. Austin speaks; Toleramus, and
toleramur, we tolerate, and are tolerated our selves: James 3.2. Galat. 6.2.
because all offend in many things, and many in all. This rule is laid down by
St. Paul; Be are ye one another burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ:
in which words he enjoyneth us not only to bear light injuries, but those
that are grievous and burdensome; and the more burdens we bear in this
kind, the less we have upon our own conscience. How can we expect that
Christ should put his shoulders to our crosses, if we withdraw our neck from
his yoke?

The third rule is, to consider the nature of our brothers temptation, and
accordingly to deal with him. This is laid down by the Apostle: Galat. 6.1.
If any man be overtaken in a fault, restore such an one in the spirit of
meekness, considering thy self, lest thou also be tempted. Abraham lied to
Abimelech, Peter denied his Master, Job utters speeches of impatience, Paul
answers very smartly to Ananias; The Lord smite thee thou painted wall: Acts
23.3.
but this they did either transported in passion, or upon great provocation, or
out of fear, to save their lives. The greater the temptation is, and the more
forcible the assault of Satan upon the frailty of our nature, the less the
sin is, or at least more pardonable. This sole consideration moved Saint
Cyprian to take pity on some of them, that in time of persecution denied their
Master, and were therefore deservedly excommunicated, whom he thus brings in
pleading for themselves, not with tears, but with drops of blood falling from
their tortured members: C^pr. de lapsis. Manabat proffetib^s sanguis. and pro
lachrymis c^^ot sem^^stulatis viscetib^^ deflueb^t, st^tit men's stabilis, and
fide fortis, and cum torq^entibus p^^nis ^mmobilis d^^ anima lactata est, sed
cum du^^ssimi Judicis recrudescente saevitua ^am fatigatum corpus, nunc
flagella scinderent, nunc contunderent fustes, etc. caro nos in colluctatione
destruit.
For a long time, say they, our resolution remained firm, and our faith
strong, and we held out the fight against our tormenting pains: but when the
malice and cruelty of the Judge was exasperated against us, and our savage
tormentors fell afresh upon our wearied and worne-out body, sometimes tearing
it with whips, sometimes bruising it with clubs, sometimes stretching it upon
the rack, sometimes scorching it with fire, our flesh forsook us in the
conflict, the weakness of our bowels gave place, and our body, not our soul,
was in the end overcome with the violence of pain. Beloved, you were never yet
brought to the fiery trial, that you might know how far the extremity of
torment might work and prevail upon the infirmity of your flesh: thank God
for it, and judge charitably of them, whose faith and constancy shone not so
clearly in the midst of the fire, but that they might be compared to the
smoking flax in the Verse following my Text.

The fourth rule is, to admonish before we punish, and give warning before we
strike. This is laid down by Deuteronomy. 12.10.
Moses: When thou come nigh to a City to besiege it, first offer conditions
of peace to it. This course God has most strictly kept, sending Noah to the
old World, Moses and Aaron to Egypt, Lot to Sodom, Obadiah to Edom, Jonah to
Nineveh, the old Prophets and Christ himself to Jerusalem, that they might
prevent Gods judgments, by repenting them of their sin; as the Ninevites had
the grace to do, who had certainly been destroyed, if destruction had not been
threatened them by the Prophet. Whereat Saint Chrysostom stands amazed, and
in the end breaks out into this passionate exclamation: O new and admirable
thing! the denuntiation of death brought forth life; the prophecy of the
overthrow overthrew the prophecy; the sentence of destruction made a nullity in
the sentence. And if Jerusalem had known the things that belonged to her
peace, even in that day in which our Savior fore-shewed her fatal doom, his
prophecy had fell, and the City had stood. For therefore God and man threaten
to inflict severe punishment, that they may not inflict what they threaten; as
Phil ^ct. l. 5. (...).
Philostrates and Nazian epist. 194. (...).
Nazianzen observe.

The fifth rule is, first to use fair and gentle means before we take a more
severe course. This is laid down by the Apostle (1 Corinthians. 4.21.) What will
you? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and the spirit of meekness?
You see the soft drops of rain pierce the hardest stones, and the warm blood
of a Goat dissolveth the Adamant. Nature seems to prescribe this method,
which always sends a flash of lightening before we hear a clap of thunder;
Et afflatur omne, priusquam percutitur: And nothing is struck, which is not
blasted before. And Art also does the like: Ovid. Met. l. 1.
Cuncta prius tentanda, sed immedicabile vulnus
Ense recidendum est, ne pars sincera trahatur.
Si frustra molliora cesserint, Seneca l. 1. de ir^.
ferit venam. For Physicians first minister weak and gentle potions, and as the
disease grows, apply stronger medicines. And good Surgeons, Homer. l. 1.
(...).
like Machaon in Homer, first lay plasters and poultesses to wounds and
swellings, and never lance or burn the part till the sore fester, and other
parts be in danger: whom good Magistrates ought to imitate, and never to use
violent and compulsive remedies, but when they are compelled thereunto; nor to
take extreme courses, Senec. l. 1. de ira. Ultima supplicia motibus ultimis
parat, ut nemo pereat, nisi quem perire etiam pereuntis intersit.
but when the malady is extreme. Desperate remedies are never good, but when no
other can be had: for they that are of a great spirit, if they be well given,
will not; if they be ill, cannot be amended by such means. They resemble Jeat,
which burns in water, but is quenched with oil: or the Plin. not. hist. l.
31. c. 7. Uno digito mobilis, idem si toto corpore impellitur resistens, ita
ratio est libra menti.
Colossus at Tarentum, which you may move with your finger, but cannot wagge,
if you put your whole strength to it. As for those that are of a weaker spirit,
and are easily daunted, harsh courses will do them more hurt than good: for
they resemble tender plants, which dye if they are touched with a Rustici
frondibus teneris non putant adhibendam falcem, quia reformidare ferrum
videntur, and cicatricem nondum pati posse.
knife or iron instrument.

The sixth rule is, to sweeten the sharpest censures with mild speeches. This
rule is delivered by Lactantius, in these words: Circumlinere poculum coelestis
sapientiae melle, when we minister a wholesome, but bitter potion, to anoint
the side of the cup with honey: when we give the patient a loathsome pill, to
lap it in sugar. The manner whereof the Spirit shows us in diverse letters
sent to the Churches of Apoc. 2.3.
Asia. First, we are to profess the good will we bear to the party, and make
it known unto him, that whatsoever we do, we do it in love. Apoc. 3.19.
I rebuke and chasten as many as I love. Secondly, to acknowledge their good
parts, if they have any: Apoc. 2.2, 4.
I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou can not
bear them that are evil: nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because
thou have left thy first love. Thirdly, to give them some good advice and
counsel with our reproof: Apoc. 3.18.
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou may be rich;
and white raiment, that thou may be clothed, and that the shame of thy
nakedness may not appear, and to anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou
may see. Lastly, to promise them favor upon any token of amendment: Apoc.
3.20.
Be zealous therefore and repent: behold, I stand at the door and knock: if
any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
with him, and he with me. Some there are who like best a resolute Chirurgian,
who, be the patient never so impatient, will do his duty, and quickly put him
out of his pain; though in the mean time he puts the party to most
intolerable torture. Give me a tenderhearted Chirurgian, who being to set an
arm or leg that is out of joint, handles it so gently, that the patient
scant feels when the bone falls in. Thus Nathan the Prophet handled King
David, 2 Samuel 12.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
and by telling him first a parable of a poor man that had but one lamb, etc.
and afterward applying it unexpectedly to the King himself ere he was aware,
as it were set not his body, but his soul in joint.

The seventh rule is, to keep the execution of justice within certain bounds,
set by equity and mercy. This rule is laid down by the Prophet Micah: He has
showed thee, O man, what is good, Micah 6.8.
and what the Lord requires of thee, to do justice, and to love mercy: and by
Solomon; Eccles. 7.16.
Be not just overmuch. Cut not too deep, nor lance too far; Ne excedat
medicina modum. It is better to leave some flesh a little tainted, than cut
away any that is sound. It is more agreeable to Gods proceedings to save a
whole City for ten righteous men's sake, than after the manner of the Romans,
when there was a mutiny in the Camp, to pay the tithe to justice, by executing
every tenth man through the whole Army. For as Germanicus cried out in Tacitus,
Tacit. annal. l. 1. Non medicina ista est, sed clades.
when he saw a great number of soldiers put to the sword for raising up
sedition in the Army: Stay your hand, this is not an execution, but a
slaughter; not a remedy, but a plague; not severity of justice, but extremity
of cruelty. For which Theodosius the Emperor was justly excommunicated by St.
Ambrose, and Aegyptus sharply censured by the Poet: Ovid. l. 1. de Pont. Eleg 9.
-- qui caede nocentum
Se nimis ulciscens extitit ipse nocens.
And Scylla was proscribed by the Historians and Poets of his time to all ages,
because he was not content with the punishment of sixty thousand in Rome, who
were executed with most exquisite torments; but entering afterward into
Praeneste, there left not a man alive: and else where also his cruelty raging
in the end, as Lucan observes, he let out the corrupt blood; but when there
was in a manner no other blood left in the whole body of the Commonwealth:
Lucan. de bell. ci. l. 1.
-- periere nocentes,
Sed cum jam soli poterant superesse nocentes.
What was this else, Sabast. conjur. Ca^il. Vasta^e civitatem, non sana^e.
than as Salust speaks, to exhaust a city, not to purge it? I am not against
the cutting off a rotten member, to preserve the whole body. I know the sword
is the only cure of an incurable wound, which yet has no place, when there is
no sound part in the whole body. Bodin. de rep. l 3. c 7. Et si salutare est
putre membrum ad universi corporis salutem urere, aut secare, non propterea si
omnia membra extabuerint, a^t gang^ena inficiantu^ sectionibus erit aut
ustionibus utendum.
Bodine speaks pertinently to this purpose: It does not follow, that because
it is good Surgery sometimes to burn out rotten flesh, or cut off a member to
save the whole, that therefore if a gangrene overspread the whole, we are to
apply a Razor or Cupping-glasse. Sen. de^^em. Poena ad paucos, metus ad omnes
perveniat.
Seneca better advises: Let the clap fright all, the thunderbolt strike but a
few. For as Cassex Jan. Great. not in Tac. Principi non minus turpia multa
supplicia, quam medico funera.
Cassiodore notes, It is as great a shame for a Magistrate, as for a
Physician, to have many dye under his hand. Choose therefore the fattest of the
beasts for sacrifice, that is, make the chief authors and ringleaders in any
sedition or riot a sinne-offering for the rest, and an example unto all. This
moderation Tully used in repressing the conspiracy of Salust. in conjur Catil.
Cataline: Quintus Curtius de gest. Alex.
Alexander in punishing the rebellion of the Articinae: Scipio in
disciplinating his Army, as if they had all read that divine sentence of Senec.
l. 1. de clem. Divina potentia est gre^aum ac public servare, multos occidere,
and indiscretos, incendii and ruinae potentia est.
Seneca, To kill men pell mell, and murder multitudes together, is liker a
ruin of a house, or the devouring of a common fire, than a moderate execution
of justice: but on the contrary, To save whole multitudes of men, and that
together from death and destruction, is an eminent work of the divine power.

The eighth rule is, to be touched with a Romans 12.15.
fellow-feeling of another misery. This is laid down by S. Paul: Colos. 3.12.
Weep with them that weep, put on the bowels of mercy, kindness, and
meekness. A good Magistrate should not be like the iron instruments of
Chirurgians, that have no sense at all of the intolerable pain which they
cause in the part pricked or launced; but like Zaleuchus, who put out one eye
of his own, when he sentenced his son according to law to lose both his
eyes. It should be a cut in their heart to cut deep into any member of Christ
Jesus. Why has God given us soft hearts, but to melt into compassion? why
moist eyes, but to shed tears, as well for others grievous affliction, as our
own sins? Tears, says the Poet, are the most sensible, and best sensible
parts we have; Nostri pars optima sensus: and they that have sap of grace in
them are fullest of them.

(...). Eras. Adag.
If Augustus never pronounced a capital sentence, without fetching a deep
sigh: If Marcellus wept before he set fire to Syracuse: Valor. Max. Ante fuas
lachrymas quam ipsorum sanguinem effudit.
If Scipio professed in an Oration to his Soldiers, that he drew a sword
through his own bowels, when he put thirty of them to death, to expiate the
trespass of eight thousand: Nay, if God himself, who is void of all passion,
is yet full of compassion; At que dolet quoties cogitur esse ferox: If he
never pronounce the dreadful sentence of destruction against any City or
Country, without great regret and seeming reluctation, Hos. 11.8.
How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, O Israel? How
shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned
within me, my repentings are kindled together. Verse. 9.
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger; -- for I am God, and not
man, etc. Beloved brethren, how should we be affected, when any of his
children, our brethren, are like to be ruined by our sentence? How loath should
we be to draw blood one from another, who are members one of another, and
fellow members of Christ Jesus? Were Christ again upon earth, could you see
him stripped stark naked, and flead with whips, and pierced with nails, and
racked on the cross, and not be pricked at heart with compunction, and
wounded deeply with compassion? And does he not assure us, that whatsoever is
done, be it good or bad, to any of his little ones, Matthew. 10.42. Acts 9.4.
is done unto him? Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Therefore never look
that he will have mercy on you in heaven, if you have no compassion on him
here, calling for food in his starved, sighing for home in his banished,
groaning for ease in his burdened, mourning for liberty in his imprisoned,
crying for pity in his grievously afflicted and tortured members.

I have applied this Text to instruction and correction: now a word of comfort
from this, that the Judge of all flesh is so meek, as has been showed. When
Benhadad the King of Syria was discomfited, and utterly overthrown by the King
of Israel, according to the advice of his servants, who told him that the Kings
of Israel were merciful, 1 Kings 20.31, 32, 34.
he sent them clothed with sackcloth, with ropes upon their heads, to entreat
for peace: now when the King of Israel saw their submission, he made a covenant
of peace with them. Better advice I cannot give you, than to put in practice
what they did: when you are overtaken with Gods judgments, and affrighted with
hell torments, cast your selves down to the ground before him, and pour out
your souls with a shower of tears, and put ropes upon your heads, that is,
acknowledge what you have deserved for your sins, and sue day and night for
pardon, and in the end you shall find by your own experience, that he that is
over all is rich in mercy unto all that call upon him. Romans 10.12.
For he will not only raise you up, and set you upon your feet, and pull the
rope off your necks, Cant. 1.11.
but will farther deck you with golden chains of spiritual graces linked
together: he will make you borders of gold with studs of silver. Nay, as when
Tygranes threw first his crown, and after himself down at the feet of
Pompey, that noble Commander, as Xiphiline writes, Xiph. in compend. Dion.
taking pity on him, put his Diadem again with his own hands upon his head,
and after took him by the hand, raised him from the ground, and set him in a
chair of state by him: So the great Commander of heaven and earth, when he
sees your unfeigned humility, and lowest submission to him, will raise you up,
put a crown of glory upon your head, and set you in a throne of majesty on his
right hand, to sit with him in judgment upon the twelve Tribes of Israel. So
be it. To God the Father, etc.

THE LAMB TURNED LION. A Sermon preached in his Graces Chapel at Lambeth,

Most REVEREND, etc.
THe words of Gedeon to the Ephraimites, Judges 8.2.
(Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of
Abiezer?) may not unfitly be applied to the written Word of God in comparison
of other books. Is not the gleaning of Scripture better than the vintage of
all secular learning? Hierom. ad rustic. Eloquentiae torcularia non verborum
pampinis, sed sensuum quasi uvarum expressionibus redundarent.
For in these the presses of eloquence abound with leaves of words, and
luxuriant stemmes of extravagant wit; but in it with spiritual senses and
divine sentences, as it were the juice and blood of the ripest grapes of the
Vine of Engeddi. It is a point of wisdom in man, who has but little, to make
it go as far as he can; and so thriftily instill it in his works, as Nature
does her influences in simples, a great quantity whereof is often distilled to
extract one drop of pure quintessence: whereas on the contrary, no plant of
Paradise, no branch of a plant, no flower of a branch, no leaf of a flower,
but affords great plenty of the water of life, more precious than any
quintessence that Art can force out of Nature. The finers of gold, Chrysostom.
tom. 5. homil. 37.
as golden mouth St. Chrysostom teaches us, deal not only with wedges,
ingots, and massy pieces of gold, but with the smallest portions thereof. And
the Apothecaries make singular use in diverse confections even of the dust of
gold. When Alexander the great managed his affairs in Judea, those whom he
employed to gather the most precious oil of Plin. l. 12. not. hist. c. 25.
Succus e plaga manat, quem Opobalsamum vocant, suavitatis eximiae, sed tenui
gutta, Alexandro magnores ibi gerente, toto dic aestivo unam concham impleri
justum erat.
Opobalsamum, thought a whole Summers day well spent in filling a small shell,
taking it as it fell drop by drop from the twigge. And if a skillful Jeweller
will not grind out a small spot, or cloud out of a rich stone, though it
somewhat dim the bright luster thereof, because the substance is so precious;
shall we lose, or slightly pass by any Iota, or tittle of the Book of God,
which shall out-last the large volumes of the heavens? for Mat. 5.18.
heaven and earth shall pass away, but no one Iota or tittle of the Word of
God shall pass. The Jewish Rabines say, that great mountains hang upon the
smallest Jods in the Bible. And St. Chrysostom. in Genesis (...).
Chrysostom will not endure a devout Christian to let go any syllable in the
Scripture, no nor prick, or point without observation. Surely, if God so
carefully preserve the smallest parcels of Scripture, he would have us
religiously observe them. Else if we content our selves with a general
handling of the Word of life, how shall we satisfy the Apostles precept of
rightly dividing the Word of God? 2. Tim. 2.15.
Show thy self a workman, that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the
Word of truth. The word in the original is not (...), dichotomizing, (the
Apostle tyeth no man to a precise Ramisticall method;) yet is it (...), rightly
cutting, or dividing the Word of truth, which cannot be done, if any sensible
part be omitted, be it but a conjunctive particle, as this Till in my Text,
which stands like an hinge in the midst of the sentence, turning the meaning
diverse ways. If it has reference to the death and resurrection of our
Savior, as Cajetan and Avendanus conceive it has, (in which he brought forth
judgment unto victory, by condemning the world, and conquering both death and
hell) then the meaning of the whole is this, He shall not strive nor cry, etc.
he shall not offer any violence to his enemies by word or deed, although he
could as easily destroy them as a man may break a reed already bruised, or
tread out the smoking week of a light ready to go out of it self, yet he
will not use this power, but contrariwise carry himself most meekly toward
them, and by his mildness and patience both condemn their fury, and conquer
their obstinacy.

If it look farther forward to the destruction of the City and Temple, and the
overthrow of the whole Jewish Nation, as Theophylact and Musculus imagine,
expounding Till he bring forth judgment unto victory, till he execute
judgment upon them that judged him, and fully be revenged of them by the sword
of the Romans; then the meaning of the whole is, He shall not break the
bruised reed of the Jewish Nation, till by the victory of the Romans he shall
execute judgment upon that Nation; nor shall he quench the smoking flax of
the Aaronicall Priesthood, till forty veeres after his death the City of
Jerusalem shall be sacked, and the Temple burned down to the ground, and by
the propagation of the Gospel, and prevailing thereof in all places, the dim
light of the Ceremonial Law be quite extinguished.

But if the word Until carry us so far as the last Judgment, to which St.
Jerome, St. Hilary, Guilliand. comment in Mat. Qui diebus carnis suae visus est
humilis and benignus doctor, aderit aliquando Jude^, and utetur potentia
absoluta, and damnavit hosts suos.
Guilliandus, and many other learned Expositors refer it, then the whole
bears this tune: See you Jesus now in the form of a servant, how humble and
meek he is, so far from killing and subduing his bloodthirsty enemies by
forcible means, that he will not strive with them; so far from lifting up
his hand against them, that he will not lift up his voice, He will not cry,
nor shall his voice be heard in the streets complaining against them; so far
from wounding the spirit, Cic. Catil. prim. Quos ferro vulnerare oportebat,
nondum voce vulnerat.
or hurting the bodies of any men, that he will not break a bruised reed, nor
quench the smoking flax. The time shall come, when you shall see this meek
Lamb turned into a fierce Lion: He who cried not upon earth, shall thunder
from heaven: He who came now to suffer in meekness, shall hereafter come in
power to conquer: He who came in humility to be judged, shall come in Majesty
to judge both quick and dead: He who came by water and blood; by water to
wash our sins, and by blood, to quench the fire of his Fathers wrath, shall
one day come in flaming fire, to render vengeance to all that believe not the
Gospel: He who in all his life never brake a bruised reed, Beza in Mat. c. 12.
Tum rebellia corda confringet, non jam clemens and humilis, sed severus, and
majestate verendus.
shall after his death and resurrection, when he comes to Judgment, if not
before, rule the Nations with a rod of Iron, and break them in pieces like a
potters vessel: He who here never quenched the smoking flax, he shall
hereafter put out the greater lights of the world: He shall darken the Sun,
and turn the Moon into blood, and shake the powers of heaven, and foundations
of the earth, and the hearts of men, and behold, he comes with the clouds,
and all eyes shall see him, Apoc. 1.7.
even they that nailed him to the Cross and pierced him; and all kindreds of
the earth shall mourn before him, Yea and Amen: then he shall bring or send
forth judgment unto victory.

He brought forth judgment in his life, by preaching the Gospel in his own
person, and he sent it forth after his death, by the ministry of his Apostles,
and does still by propagating the Church: but he brings not forth judgment
unto victory in the Evangelists phrase; because this his judgment is much
oppressed, the light of his truth smoothered, the pure doctrine of the Gospel
suppressed, the greater part of the Kings of the earth, and Potentates of this
world refusing to submit their scepter to his Cross, and saying, as it is in
St. Lukes Gospel, Luke 17.14.
We will not have this man to reign over us: but when the son of man shall
display his banner in the clouds, and the winds shall have breathed out their
last gaspes, and the sea and the waters shall roar; when heaven and earth
shall make one great bonefire, when the stage of this world shall be removed,
and all the actors in it shall put off their feigned persons and guises, and
appear in their own likeness; when the man of sin, 2 These. 2.3, 8.
that exalts himself above all that is called God, shall be fully revealed,
and after consumed with the spirit of Christ's mouth, and be destroyed by the
brightness of his coming: then he shall suddenly confound the rest of his
enemies, Atheists, Hypocrites, Jews, Turks, Idolatrous Gentiles and
Heretics, and break the necks of all that stubbornly resist him, and then
the truth shall universally prevail, and victoriously triumph. All this
variety of descant which you hear, is but upon two notes, a higher and a
lower, the humility and the majesty, the infirmity and the power, the obscurity
and the glory, the mildness and the severity of our Lord and Savior; his
humility upon earth, his majesty in heaven; his infirmities in the days of his
flesh, and his power since he sits at the right hand of his Father; the
obscurity and privacy of his first coming, and solemnity of his second: his
mildness and clemency during the time of grace and mercy, and his wrath and
severity at the day of Judgment and Vengeance. Ecce, tibia cecinimus vobis;
Behold, out of this Scripture, I have piped unto you, recording the pleasing
notes of our Redeemers mildness and mercy, who never brake the bruised reed,
nor quenched the smoking flax: now I am to mourn unto you, sounding out the
doleful notes of his justice and severity, which shall one day bring forth
judgment unto victory.

But before I set to the sad tune, pricked before me in the rules of my Text,
I am to entreat you to listen a while till I shall have declared unto you the
harmony of the Prophet Esaias, and the Evangelist S. Matthew; the rather because
there seems some dissonancy and jarre between them. For in Esaias we read,
Esaias 42.3.
He shall bring forth judgment unto truth, that is, give sentence according
to truth; but in St. Matthew, He shall send forth judgment unto victory, which
imports somewhat more than (...) (viz.) that the judgment he shall send
forth, viam inveniet aut faciet, shall either find way or force it, take place
or make place, no man or devil being able to withstand it. Besides this
discord in their notes, there is a sweet strain in the Prophet ( he shall not
fail, Verse. 4.
nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment on the earth) left out in the
Evangelist. To the first exception the Jesuit Maldonat says, that the Syriack
word signifies both truth and victory, and that Saint Matthew wrote not in
pure Hebrew, but in the Hebrew then current, which was somewhat alloyed and
embased with other languages; which if it were granted unto him, as it is not
by those who defend that the Greek in the New Testament is the original, yet
the breach is not fully made up. For still the original Hebrew in Esaias, and
the Greek in Saint Matthew, which has been ever held authentical, are at
odds: (...) in Hebrew signifying truth, and (...) in the Greek signifying
victory, and not truth. I grant the truth of Christ is most victorious, and
has subdued all the false gods of the Heathen, as the Arc laid Dagon on his
face, and the rod of Aaron devoured all the rods of the Magicians: yet truth
and victory are not all one. A weak Judge may bring forth judgment unto
truth, yet not unto victory; as on the contrary a potent and corrupt Judge may
bring forth judgment unto victory, yet not unto truth. Tully in a bad cause
prevailed against Oppianicus, by casting dust in the Judges eyes. And Aeschines
prevailed not against Ctesiphon in a good cause. Right is often overcome by
might, and sometimes by the sleight of a cunning Advocate for the false part.
To the second objection Beza answers, that these words, that he will not
fail, nor be discouraged, till he has set judgment on the earth, were
anciently in St. Matthew, but of late, through the carelessness of some
transcriber, from whose copy ours were drawn, are left out. But since this
Verse is wanting in all the copies of Saint Matthew now extant, neither can
Beza bring good proof of any one in which this Verse was ever found, it is not
safe to lay any such imputation upon the first transcribers of St. Matthewes
Gospel, whereby a gap may be opened to Infidels and Heretics to cavell at the
impeachable authority of the holy Scriptures in the original languages. A safe
and easy way to wind out of these perplexed difficulties, is to acknowledge,
that the Evangelist, who wrote by the same spirit wherewith the Prophet Esaias
was inspired, tied nor himself precisely to the Prophets words; but fitteth
the Prophets sense to his own purpose, and what the Prophet delivered in two
Verses, he contracteth into one. For what is he shall bring forth judgment
unto truth, and he shall not faint nor be discouraged, till he has done it;
but that he shall do it effectually and powerfully? and what is that but he
shall send forth judgment unto victory?

He shall send forth. Call. in Mat. 1. Hoc verbum educere quo utitur Propheta,
significat officium Christi esse Regnum Dei, quod tum inclusum erat in angulo
Judeae propagare in totum orbem.
This phrase reaches forth unto us a twofold observation; the first touching
the extent, the second touching the freedom of this judgment here spoken of.
By judgment is here meant the Kingdom of Christ, which must not be confined
to Jury, nor bounded within the pale of Palaestine: but he sent forth, that
is, propagated and spread over the whole world, according to the prophecy of
the Psalmist, Psalm. 110.2.
The Lord shall send a rod of thy strength out of Sion: be thou ruler in the
midst of thine enemies. Whilst our Savior lived upon earth, the sovereign
balsamum of wounded mankind yielding a savor of life unto life, was kept as it
were in a narrow box; but at our Saviors death the box was broken, and this
precious ointment poured out, and the whole world filled with the smell
thereof. This doctrine touching the naturalizing (if I may so speak) of the
Gentiles into the spiritual Commonwealth of Israel, was employed in the
Metaphor of the Rose of the field; Cantic. 2.1.
I am the Rose of the field (Christ is not a garden flower, for few to see, and
fewer to smell unto; but a Rose of the field, for all to gather that have a
hand of faith to touch him): but it was unfolded at large to Saint Peter in a
vision of a sheet let down from Heaven, knit at four corners, Acts 10.11, 12.
in which were all manner of four footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts,
and creeping things, etc. The four corners of the sheet signified the four
parts of the world, all sorts of living creatures, all sorts of men, of all
kindreds, nations, and languages. The sheet in which they were all wrapped is
the Church militant. In the end of the vision the vessel was received up
again into heaven, Acts 10.16.
to show, that in the end of the world the whole Church militant shall be
transported into heaven, and become triumphant. St. Orig. comment. in Cant.
homil. 1. Quemadmodum in Evangelio mulier illa quae sanguine fluebat, archi
Synagogae filiam curatione praevenit; sic Aethiopissa, id est, Gentium
Ecclesia, Israel aegrotante sanata est.
Origin represents this truth most clearly unto us through the mirror of an
allegory; Though (says he) the found of the Gospel came later unto the
Gentiles, yet the Gentiles prevented the Jews in giving credit to it, and were
justified before them; as the woman in the Gospel, that was sick of a bloody
issue, was healed before the Rulers daughter. The daughter of the Ruler of the
Synagogue, was a type of the Jewish Synagogue; the woman that was in a long
consumption by reason of her continual flux of blood, was an emblem of the
people of the Gentiles, lying more than twelve ages sick of a bloody issue,
weltring in her natural filth and blood. Now, as Christ, going to cure the
Rulers daughter, was touched by the Canaanitish woman sick of a bloody issue,
and she by that touch was cured; so though Christ came first to heal the
Synagogue, yet the Gentile Church touching the hemme of his garment by faith,
is first healed and saved.

The phrase of sending forth judgment, expresses our Saviors readiness in
opening the treasures of heavenly wisdom, and unfolding the mysteries of
eternal salvation; (...) till he shoots out, casts out, or sends forth
judgment of his own accord, as a tree does his fruit, or the Sun his
beams. Matthew. 12.35.
A good man brings forth out of the treasure of his heart good things. Matthew.
2.11.
The Sages opened their treasures, and every Scribe which is instructed unto
the Kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an house-holder, which
brings forth out of his treasures things new and old. I have not hid thy
righteousness within my heart, Psalm. 40.10.
says David in the person of Christ, I have declared thy faithfulness and thy
salvation: I have not concealed thy loving kindness and thy truth from the
great congregation. Ver. 9.
I have preached righteousness in the great assembly, I have not refrained my
lips, O Lord, thou know. And according to this foregoing type, how ready
the truth himself was to publish the Gospel of the Kingdom, appears by his
taking all occasions from every ordinary occurrent, to instruct his Disciples
in points of heavenly wisdom; as from a draught of fish to admonish them of
fishing for souls: from Well-water, to treat of the water of life: from barley
loaves, to exhort them to labor for the food that perishes not: from burying
the dead, to reprove those that are dead in sin: from curing the blind in
body, to rebuke the spiritual blindness of the Scribes and Pharisees: from a
question concerning the material Temple, to foretell the dissolution of the
temple of his body, and raising it up again in three days. To conceal any
needful, especially saving truth, is to bury the gold of Ophir, and thereby
deprive not only others, but our selves also of the benefit and use thereof.
Wherefore St. August l. 12. confess. Veritas nec mea, nec tu^, nec illius est,
sed omnium nostrum quos ad ejus communionem public vocas, admonens nos ut
nolimus eam habere privatam, ne privemut ea.
Augustine sharply censureth such as would challenge a peculiar interest and
propriety in that which is the common treasure of Gods Church, saying: The
truth is neither mine, nor thine, nor his, but all ours in common, whom thou, O
Lord, call publicly to the communion thereof, dreadfully admonishing us,
not to desire to have it private, lest we be deprived of it. In special, the
truth of judgment ought not to be kept in, but to be sent forth. For to
detain any private man's goods, is but a private wrong; but unrighteously to
detain justice, which is the Kings, or the Commonwealths, or rather both
their good, is a kind of peculatus, or public theft. We laugh at the Indians
for casting in great store of gold yearly into the river Ganges, as if the
stream would not run currently without it: yet when the current of justice
is stopped in many Courts, the wisest Soliciters of suits can find no better
means than such as the Indians use, (by dropping in early in the morning gold
and silver into Ganges) to make it run. Pliny reports of Apis the Egyptian
god (whom they worshipped in the likeness of a Cow or Ox) that he gave
answers to private men, e manu consulentium cibum capiendo, Taking always some
food from their hands, otherwise the Oracle was dumb. I need not to prosecute
the application in this place, where, by the testimony of all men, and the
truth it self, the stream of Justice (if any where) runs clearly, most
free from all filth and corruption. Therefore I pass from Christ his sending
forth judgment to his victory.

He shall send forth judgment unto victory.

There are two principal acts, or to speak more properly, effects of our
Lords Princely function, (...) and (...), judgment and victory; judgment
upon, and victory over all his enemies: We have them both in the words of my
Text, Judgment which he shall send forth, and Victory unto which. But of what
Judgment or Victory the words are to be construed, the learned Interpreters
of holy Writ somewhat differ in judgment. Some in their ghesses fall short
upon the particular judgment and utter overthrow of the Jewish Nation by
Vespasian, and his son Titus. Others defer the accomplishment of this
prophecy, till the dreadful day of the Worlds doom, when by the shrill sound
of the Archangels Trumpet all the dead shall be awaked, and the son of man
shall march out of Heaven with millions of Angels to his Judgment seat in the
clouds, where he shall sit upon the life and death of mankind. That day,
says Saint August. l. 20. de civitate Dei. Ille dies judicii proprie dicitur,
eo quod nullus erit ibi imperitae querelae locus, Cur injustus ille sit foelix,
and cur justus ille infoelix?
Austin, may be rightly called a Day of Judgment, because then there shall
be no place left for those usual exceptions against the judgments of God,
and the course of his providence on earth, viz. Why is this just man unhappy,
and why is that unjust man happy? Why is this profane man in honor, and that
godly man in disgrace? Why does this wicked man prosper in his evil ways, and
that righteous man fail in his holy attempts? Nay, why for a like fact does
some man receive the guerdon of a crown, and another of a Juvenal. Satyr.
Sceleris pretium ille crucem tulit, hic diadema.
cross or gibbet? the one of a halter, the other of a chain of gold? These
and the like murmurs against the justice of the Judge of all flesh shall be
hushed, and all men shall say in the words of the Psalm. 58.11.
Psalmist, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God
that judges in the earth. And then Christ may be said properly to bring or
send forth judgment, when he reveals the secrets of all hearts, displayeth
all men's consciences, and declares the circumstances of all actions, whereby
all men's judgments may be rightly informed in the proceedings of the
Almighty, and all men may see the justice of God in those his most secret and
hidden judgments, at which the wisest on earth are astonished, and dare not
look into them, lest they should be swallowed up in the depth of them. I
speak of those judgments of God, which Saint August. lo. sup. cit. Dies
declarabit ubi hoc quoque manifestabitur, quam justo Dei judicio fiat, ut nunc
tam multa, ac pene omnia justa Dei judicia sensus mentemque mortalium fugiant,
cum tamen in hac repiorum fidem non lateat justum esse, quod latet.
Austin terms Occulie justa, and just occulta; Secretly just, and justly
secret: so they are now; but at the day of Judgment they shall be manifestly
just, and justly manifest; then it shall appear not only that the most secret
judgments of God are just, but also that there was just cause why they should
be secret, or kept hidden till that day. Lastly, then Christ may be said
properly to bring forth judgment unto victory, because he shall first conquer
all his enemies, and then judge and sentence them to everlasting torments. Of
which dreadful Judgment, ensuing upon the glorious Victory of the Prince of
peace over the great Whore, and the false Prophet, and the Devil that
deceives them all; from which the Archangel shall sound a retreat, by blowing
the last trump, and summoning all that have slept in the dust to arise out of
their graves, and come to judgment, I need not to add any thing more in this
Religious and Christian auditory. Wherefore I will fill up the small remainder
of the time with some brief observations upon the ruin and utter desolation
of the Jewish Nation, who even to this day wandering like Vagabonds in all
countries, and made slaves not only to Christians, but to Moors, Turks, and
other Infidels, rue the crucifying of the Lord of life, and the spilling of the
innocent blood of the immaculate Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of
the World. As according to the custom of our country, Quarter Sessions are
held in Cities and Shire-townes, before the general Assizes; so Christ a
little more than forty years after his death at Jerusalem, and ascension into
Heaven, held a Quarter Sessions in Jerusalem for that country and people: after
which he shall certainly keep a general Assizes for the whole world, when the
sins of all Nations shall be ripe for the Angels sickle.

Some of the wisest of the Jewish Rabbis entering into a serious consideration
of this last and greatest calamity that ever befell that people, together with
the continuance thereof more than 1500. years, and casting with themselves
what sin might countervaile so heavy a judgment, in the end have grown to
this resolution, that surely it could be no other than the spilling of the
Messiah blood, which cried for this vengeance from heaven against them. And
verily if you observe all the circumstances of times, persons, and places,
together with the manner and means of their punishments, and lay them to the
particulars of Christ's sufferings in and from that Nation, you shall see this
point as clearly set before your eyes, as if these words were written in
letters of blood upon the sacked walls of Jerusalem, Messiah his Judgment and
Victory over the Jews.

1. Mocking repaid.
1. Not full six years after our Lords passion, most of those indignities and
disgraces which the Jews put upon him, were returned back to themselves by
Flaccus, and the Citizens of Alexandria, who scurrilously mocked their King
Agrippa in his return from Rome, by investing a mad man, called Carabbas, with
Princely robes, and putting a reed in his hand for a Scepter, and saluting him,
Hail King of the Jews. Note here the Jews mocking of Christ repaid unto
themselves: yet this was not all. Whipping repaid.
The Alexandrians were not content thus scornfully to deride the King of the
Jews, they proceeded farther to make a daily sport of scourging many of the
Nobility, even to death, and that, which Philo sets a Tragical accent upon,
at their solemnest Feast. Note here the Jews whipping and scourging Christ
upon the solemn Feast of Passover repaid unto them.

3. Spitting repaid.
3. And howsoever their noble and discreet Ambassador Philo made many
remonstrances to the Emperor Caligula of these unsufferable wrongs offered to
their Nation; yet that Emperor, because the Jews had refused to set up his
Image in the Temple, was so far from relieving them, or respecting him
according to the quality he bare, that he spurned him with his foot, and spit
on his face. Note here the Jews spitting on Christ repaid them.

4. The Jews refusing Christ to be their King, to flatter the Roman Caesar,
revene^d on them by Caesar himself.
4. In conclusion, the Emperor sent him away with such disgrace and discontent,
that he, turning to his countrymen, said: Be of good cheer, Sirs, for God
himself must needs right us now, since his Vicegerent, from whom we expected
justice, does so much wrong us, and contrary to the law of all Nations most
inhumanely, insolently, and barbarously uses me, employed as a public
minister of state for our whole Nation. But all this in vain; these wrongs
fell right upon them. It was just with God, that they who in disdain of his
Son cried out, We have no King but Caesar, should find no favor at Caesar's
hands, and much less at Gods, before whom they preferred Caesar. Baron. annal.
Noluerunt florem, nacti sunt Florum praesidem.
They would none of the flower of Jesse, they cast him away: therefore God in
justice after the former troubles, sent them by Nero's appointment Deputy
Florus, The Pharisces envy at the peoples crying* Hosanna to Christ, punished.
who robbed their Church treasury to raise a rebellion, and after put them to
the sword for this rebellion: received money of them to save them from spoil,
and spoiled them the more for it; insomuch that the Scribes and Pharisees, and
chief Rulers, who rebuked the people for bringing in Christ to Jerusalem with
branches of palms, and happy acclamations of Hosanna to the son of David,
Hosanna in the highest, are now forced to bring out all the treasures of the
Temple, and Priestly ornaments, by them as it were to adjure the people, and
beseech them even with tears to march out of Jerusalem in seemliest order, and
with expressions of joy to meet and greet the Roman soldiers, who requited
their salutations with scorns, and their gifts with pillaging them. Note here
the Jews envy at Christ's triumphant riding into Jerusalem punished.

6. I beseech you observe the circumstances of time, persons, and place, and
you shall perceive that divine Justice did not only make even reckonings with
them in every particular of our Saviors sufferings, but also kept the precise
day and place of payment. Galilee, wherein Christ first preached, and wrought
so many miracles, first of all suffers for her unbelief, and is laid waste by
Vespasian. The infinite slaughter at Jerusalem, began with the high Priest
Ananus his death, whom the Zelots slew in the Temple: Sanguine foedantem quas
ipse sacraverat aras. A lamentable sight, says Josephus, to see the chief
Priest, a little before clad with sacred and glorious vestments, richly
embroidered with gold and precious stones, lie naked in the streets, wallowing
in dirt, mud, and blood; to behold that body which had been anointed with holy
oil, to be torn with dogs, and devoured by ravenous and unclean foul; to
look upon the Altar in the Temple polluted with the blood of him, who before
had hallowed it with the blood of beasts. But so it was most agreeable to
divine Justice, that that order (though never so sacred) should first and most
dreadfully rue our Lords death, whose envy was first, and malice deepest in
the effusion of his most innocent blood. Who can but take notice of that which
the Histories of those times, written by Jews as well as Christians, offer to
all readers observation? viz. That the Jews, who escaped out of Jerusalem, and
fell into their enemies quarter, because they were thought to devour down
their money and jewels, that the Roman soldiers might not find them about
them, were in great numbers after they were slain, ripped Their giving money
to Judas to betray him, repaid.
and bowelled; and that besides those Jews crucified by Flaccus, whose death
Philo in legate. Alii die festo mortuos de crucibus detraxerunt, at hic, non
mortuos de crucibus, sed vivos in crucem sustulit.
Philo so much bewailed, because the execution was done upon them at their
great Feasts, without any regard to the solemnity of the day: there were so
many in this last siege of Jerusalem Their crucifying him repaid with advantage.
crucified on the walls every day, that there wanted in the end crosses for
men's bodies, and spaces for crosses. Note here their price of blood given to
Judas to betray his Master, as also their crucifying the Lord of glory, was
repaid with advantage. Crucified they are in their persons (for some of them
that conspired Christ's death might live till this time) or in their children
and nephews by hundreds, who cried to Pilate when he would have freed Christ,
Away with him, away with him; Crucify him, crucify him. Their blood is shed
for money, who gave money to betray innocent blood; and shortly after thirty of
them are sold for a piece of silver, who bought his life at thirty pieces of
silver.

As we have compared persons and actions, or rather passions; so let us now
parallel times and places. Titus began to besiege Jerusalem, as Caesar Baronius
exactly calculateth, upon the day in which our Savior suffered: he surveyed
the City on Mount Their contempt of Christ's tears,
Olivet, whence our Savior before viewing it, wept over it. And now the Jews
have their wish against their wills, their and their cursing revenged. Matthew.
27.25.
own curse is returned to their bosom, viz. His blood be upon us and our
children. For so indeed it was, in such a manner and measure, as never before
was heard or seen. Besides those that fled out of the City, which were either
crucified upon the walls, or slain by the gates, when Titus made a breach into
the City, he saw all their streets paved in a manner with carkeises, and
caemented with blood: yea, their channels ran with gore so full, that the best
means they could think of, or use to quench the fire of the Temple, was the
blood of the slain. And now Jerusalem which had been so free in Their stoning
Gods Prophets, and spilling innocent blood, repaid.
casting stones at the Prophets, and killing them that were sent unto her, (to
exhort them to repentance unto life, and showed before of the coming of the
Just One, of whom these later Jews had been the betrayers and murderers) has
not one stone left upon another in her, Acts 7.52.
but is made even with the dust; nay, nothing but dust, Sutton. de Tiber.
and (...), dirt leavened with blood, the just temper of that Tyrants
complexion, in whose reign the Lord of glory was crucified.

What other conclusion are we to infer upon these sad premises but this,
that it is a most fearful thing to provoke the Lion of the Tribe of Judah? Who
shall be able to stand before him in the great day of his wrath, from whose
face the heaven and the earth fled away, 1 Pet. 2.7. Mat. 21.42, 44.
and their place could no where be found? The stone which the builders refused,
is now become the head of the corner. Take heed how ye stumble on it, or lift
at it; Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but upon whomsoever
it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder, Vid. mag. de burg. sub. finem.
Cent. prim. and Baron. annal. tom. 1.
as it did Herod, and Pilate, and Annas, and Caiaphas, and all that were
accessory to the death of the Lord of life. And not only those that committed
high treason against the sacred person of the Lords Anointed, and imbrued
their hands, and stained their consciences with that blood which cleanses us
from all sin; 1 John 1.7.
but also Nero, and Domitian, and Trajan, and Antoninus, and Severus, and
Maximinus, and Decius, and Valerianus, and Dioclesianus, and Maxentius, and all
other Emperors that employed their swords; and Simon Magus, and Cerinthus, and
Arrius, and Nestorius, and Manes, and all other obstinate arch-Heretickes, who
employed their pens against him: none have hitherto escaped the heavy
judgment of God, who have bid battle to the Christian Faith, and have
wilfully, and of set malice given the Spouse of Christ the least wound or
skarre, either by a gash with their sword, or a scratch with their pen. Be
wise now therefore, O ye Kings: Psalm. 2.10, 11, 12.
be instructed ye Judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice
with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the
way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: blessed are all they that put
their trust in him.

Some Interpreters by Judgment understand the spiritual government of Christ,
which is managed in his Church with excellent wisdom and judgment; and by
Victory, the prevalent power of grace in the faithful, whereby they are
victorious in all temptations, in such sort, that though Satan labor with all
his might to blow out a poor spark, yet he shall not be able to quench it:
and that the smallest degree of faith, like a grain of mustard seed, is
stronger than the gates of hell, and is able to remove mountains of doubts and
oppositions cast up by Satan, and our rebellious hearts, between God and us.
And from hence they enforce the Apostles exhortation to all the soldiers of
Christ, to be strong in the Lord, Ephesians. 6.10.
and in the power of his might; not to look who are their enemies, but who is
our Captain; not what they threaten, but what he promises, who has taken
upon him, as to conquer for us, so to conquer in us. These are sweet and
comfortable notes, but, as I conceive, without the rule of this Text: for
questionless the Donec, or Until, is not superfluous, or to no purpose; but
has reference to some future time, when Christ's mild proceedings shall be at a
period, and he shall take another course with his enemies, such as I have
before described in the particular judgment of the Jewish Nation, and the
general judgment of the whole World. But if Judgment and Victory be taken
in their sense, there needed no until to be added. For Christ even from the
beginning of his preaching, when he strived not, nor cried, nor brake the
bruised reed, nor quenched the smoking flax, sent forth judgment unto
victory, according unto their interpretation, that is, wisely governed his
Church, and gave victory to the faithful in their conflicts with sin and
Satan. That therefore the members of this sentence be not co-incident, and
that the donec or until may have his full force, I conceive, agreeably to the
exposition of the ancient, and the prime of the later Interpreters, that in
this clause, Till he bring forth judgment unto victory, the Prophet
determines the limits of the time of grace. Whosoever comes In between the
first and second coming of Christ shall be received into favor, but after,
the gates of mercy shall be locked up. Yet our gracious Ahasuerus reaches out
his golden Scepter to all that have a hand of faith to lay hold on it; but then
he shall take his Iron mace or rod in his hand, to bruise his enemies, and
break them in pieces like a potters vessel. I must sing therefore with holy
David, of Mercy and Judgment; mercy in this life, and judgment in the life to
come: mercy during the day of grace, but judgment at the day of the Worlds
doom. For although sometimes God meets with the Reprobate in this life, yet
that judgment which they feel here may be accounted mercy in comparison of
that which shall be executed upon them hereafter, without all mitigation of
favor, release of torments, or limitation of time. Now the vials drop on them,
but then they shall be poured all out upon them. Wherefore let us all, like
the bruised reed, fall down to the earth, and humble our selves under the
mighty hand of God. Let us, like smoking flax, send forth bitter fumes of
sighs for our sins, assuring our selves, that now whilst the day of grace
lasts, he will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax:
but if we neglect this time of grace, and defer our repentance, till he send
forth judgment unto victory, we shall smoke for it. Cogitemus fratres de
tempore in tempore, ne pereamus cum tempore; Let us think of time in time,
lest we perish with time. Let us imagine that we now saw the Angel standing
upon the sea, Apoc. 10 5, 6.
and upon the earth, and lifting up his hand to heaven, and swearing by him
that lives for ever, who created heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the
things that are therein, that there should be time no longer. Jonas 2.8.
O let us not forsake our own mercy, but to day if we will hear his voice,
harden not our hearts, but mollify them, by laying them asoake in tears. Let
us break off our sins suddenly by repentance, and our iniquities by
almsdeeds. Now is the seed-time, let us now therefore sow the seeds of faith,
hope, mercy, meekness, temperance, patience, and all other divine Virtues, and
we shall reap a plentiful harvest in heaven. Cypr. ad Dom. Hic vita aut
amittitur aut tenetur, hic saluti aeternae cultu Dei, and fructu fidei
providetur. Galat. 6.8.
For he that sows to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he
that sows to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. Which
God of his infinite mercy grant that we may all do in heaven, through the
merits of his Son, by the grace of the holy Spirit: to whom, etc.

THE TRAITORS GUERDON. A Sermon preached on the Gowries conspiracy before his
Grace, and diverse Lords and persons of eminent quality, at Croydon, August 5.
Anno Dom. 1618. THE FIFTH SERMON.
PSALM. 63. VER. 9, 10, 11. 9. But those that seek my soul to destroy it,
shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

10. They shall make him run out like water by the hands of the sword: they
shall be a portion for Foxes.

11. But the King shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall
glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.


Most REVEREND, Right Honr. Right Worsh. etc.
We are at this present assembled with religious Rites and sacred Ceremonies,
to celebrate the unfortunately fortunate Nones of August, which are noted in
red letters in the Roman Calendar (as I guess) to represent the blood of many
thousand Martyrs spilt upon them: (twenty three whereof were put to most
exquisite torments by Dioclesian in Rome) but deserve to be distinguished from
other days by golden letters in ours, in memory of two of the most renowned
Princes that ever swayed Scepter in these Kingdoms wherein we live; the one
received life, the other escaped death on this day. For Bed. and Baron. in
Martyrolog. men's. August.
Beda and Baronius in their Church Rolls of Martyrs, record on the fifth of
August the nativity of King Oswald; who united the Which were after severed for
many ages, but ^ow by the special providence of Almighty God again lie
lovingly, encompassing and embracing each the other.
Crowns of England and Scotland, and after he had much enlarged the bounds of
Christ's Kingdom with his own, in the end exchanged his Princely Diadem for a
Crown of Martyrdom, and signed the Christian Faith with Royal blood. So
happy an uniter of the Royal Diadems, and Princely Martyr of our Nation,
should not be forgotten on this day; yet may he not every way compare with our
Rex Pacificus, who has so fastened these Diadems together, that we hope they
shall never be severed again. Nor is the birth of any Prince by the usual
course of Nature so remarkable, as the unheard of, and little less than
miraculous preservation of our Sovereign his Royal person, from the bloody
assacinate of the Earl Gowry, and Alexander Ruthen his brother, to the
everlasting memory whereof our Church has consecrated the public and most
solemn devotions of this day. And therefore we are now to change the old
spell, Quintam fuge, and (...), that is, Carefully shun the fifth day, into
Quintam cole, Religiously observe the fifth day of this Month; if not for King
Oswald, yet for King James sake: if not for the birth of the one, yet for the
safety of the other: if not for the ordinary Genesis and entry of the one into
the gate of life, yet for the extraordinary Exodus, or exit of the other out of
the chambers of death. Which wonderful delivery of our gracious Sovereign
that I may print the deeper in your memories, I have borrowed characters from
King David's royal press as you see: But those that seek my soul, etc. Ver.
9, 10, 11.

All which Verses, together with their several parts and commaes, even to the
least Iota or tittle, by the direction and assistance of Gods holy Spirit, I
will make use of in my application, if I may entreat Here he bowed to his Grace.
your Gracious patience, and Here he turned to the Lords.
your Honorable attention for a while in their explication. And first of the
translation, then of the relation of these words, as well to the eternal
destruction of the enemies to Christ's Cross, as to the temporal punishments
of the traitors to David's Crown. They shall go into the lower parts of the
earth,
these shall go into the nethermost hell.
They shall fall by the hands of men,
these shall fall into the hands of the living God.
They shall be a portion for Foxes,
these shall he a prey for Devils.
But the King shall rejoice in God,
David in Christ,
Christ in his Father.
And all that swear
by him, that is, Christ,
to him, that is, David, shall glory.
For the mouth of all that speak
lies against the one,
blasphemies against the other, shall be stopped.


The vulgar Latin, upon which the Roman Church so doteth, that she is in love
with the errors thereof, as Cic. de orat. Naevus in puero delectat Alceum, est
deformitas in vultu, illi tamen lumen videbatur.
Alceus was with the wirts in his boys face, rendereth the Hebrew thus:
Quaesiverunt in vanum animam meam, introibunt in ima terrae; They have sought
my soul in vain, they shall go into the lowest parts of the earth. Of which
words in vanum inserted into the Text, I may say as Aristotle does of the
ancient Philosophers discourse Aristot. Phys. auscust. c. de Vacuo. (...).
de vacuo, of a supposed place void of a body to fill it. Their disputes,
faith he, of this void or empty space, are empty, void, and to none effect. For
neither are they found in any original copy, as is confessed, neither serve
they as artificial teeth to help the speech, which sounds better without
them: yet Cardinal Bellarmine to help out the vulgar Interpreter, with an
officious lie bears us in hand, that his book was otherwise pointed than ours
are, and that where we read (...) he reads (...) as if Leshoath and Leshava,
the one signifying to destroy, the other in vain, differed no more than in
pricks or vowels, and not in consonants and radicals; or the sense were so
full and current, they seek my soul in vain, as they seek my soul to
destroy it, or for the ruin or destruction thereof they shall go to the
lowest parts of the earth, that is, they that seek to overthrow me, and lay
mine honor in the dust, they shall lie in the dust themselves.

They shall fall by the sword. So we read in the last translation, and the
members of the sentence seem better to fall and shoot one in the other, if we
so read the words, They shall fall by the edge of the sword, they shall be a
portion for Foxes, than if we read according to the Geneva Translation, They
shall cast him down with the edge of the sword, they shall be a portion for
Foxes. Yet because Calvin, Moller, Musculus, Tremelius, and Junius concur
with the Geneva Translation and Note, understanding these words as a special
prophecy of Saul's death, who was David's capital and singular enemy; and this
translation and exposition fitteth better the application which I am to make of
this Scripture to the present occasion: but especially because the Hebrew
Jaggirhu signifies as the last Translators rightly note in the margent, (...)
They shall make him run out like water by the hand of the sword, that is,
his blood shall be spilt by the sword; I prefer the Geneva Translation before
the last; and as the Macedonian woman appealed from Philip to Philip, so I
appeal from the Translators in the Text, to themselves in their Marginall
note, and read the tenth Verse thus: They shall cast him down, or slay him
with the edge of the sword.

Thus having accorded the Translations, I now set to such heavenly lessons, as
the Spirit of God has pricked for us in the rules of this Scripture. The first
is pricked in the title of this Psalm, (A Psalm of David when he was in the
wilderness of Judah) and it is this:

That the wilderness it self may be, and is often a Paradise to the servants
of God. If the Poet could say of himself and his friend, Quo cunque loco Roma
duobus erit; Martial. epigr.
Wheresoever we two are, we make that place as Rome to us: have we not great
reason to think, that wheresoever God and the faithful soul are together,
and the one enjoys the presence of the other, there is Paradise, nay, there
is Heaven? This sweet flower I gather from this wilderness, to which David was
driven by the pursuit of Saul his dreadful and powerful enemy. It was a vast
and wild place, a thirsty land without water, verse the first: yet here David
is refreshed with waters of comfort, and rivers of pleasure: there was neither
Church nor Chapel in it; yet here David sees the glory of God as in the
Sanctuary, verse the second. It was a barren soil, yielding no manner of
sustenance for men or cattle; yet here David is satisfied as with marrow and
fatness, verse the sixth. It was a hot and scorching place; yet here David
finds a shade to cool himself, (viz.) under the shadow of Gods wings, verse
the eighth. In regard of which commodities of this wilderness, I cannot but
break out into the praises of it, as Saint Hierom. epist. ad Heliodor. O
Desertum, Christ^ floribus vernans! O Solitudo, in qua illi nascuntur lapides
de quibus in Apocalypsi civitas magni Regis extruitur! O Eremus, familiarus Deo
gaudens! Quam diu te tectorum umbrae premunt? quam di^ fum sarum u bium ca cer
includit? nescio quid hic plus lucis aspicio.
Jerome does into the commendations of the Desert of Syria: O Wilderness,
enameled with the flowers of Paradise! O Desert, in which those stones grow, of
which the heavenly Jerusalem is built! O solitude, enjoying the familiarity of
God and his Angels! Why do thou keep under the shade of houses? Why do
thou shut thy self up in the prison of smoaky Cities? come hither to me, thou
shall find here freer air, and much more light. Such pleasure this holy
Father took in that solitary and uncouth place. And Saint Hilar. con. Auxent.
Male vos parietum amor cepit, montes mihi, and sylvae, and solitudines, and
lacus, and voragines sunt tutio res; in illis enim Propherae aut demersi, aut
manentes Dei Spiritu prophetabant.
Hilary seems to be in love with the like places, by those speeches of his:
You do ill to dote upon walls, to build your faith upon stately buildings. I
for my part prefer hills and woods, deserts and dens, and caves, and rocks,
and lakes, for these have been the habitations and lodgings of Gods dearest
servants the Prophets. The Law was first given in the Wilderness of Arabia.
The Gospel was first preached by John the Baptist in the Wilderness of Judeah.
The noblest duel that ever was fought, was between Christ and the Devil, and
the pitched field was the Wilderness. The woman that was clothed with the
Sun, and had the Moon under her feet, lived obscurely in the Wilderness a
thousand, two hundred, and sixty days: and many of Gods dearest children all
the days of their life, Apoc. 12.6.

The number of whom was so great, and their labors so profitable, and their
lives so admirable in the Primitive Church, that as the Prophet spoke of the
barren woman, that she had more children than she that had an husband; so we
may say of the barren soil and wilderness, that it has brought forth a
greater increase to the Church than many inhabited countries, and better
husbanded land. There are diverse sorts of plants and fruits, that must be set
in the Sun, or else they will not prosper; but others are scorched with the
heat thereof, and better thrive in the shade: such were Paulus Vid. Hieron. in
^ita Paidi, and Hilarionis; and Marianum. Victorinum in vita sancti Hieronomi.
Eremita, St. Antony, St. Hilarion, St. Basil, S. Jerome, St. Isidore
Pelusiotes, and others, which proved the fairest flowers in the garden of the
Church, and prime-roses of Christ's Spouse, yet grew in the Wilderness: with
whom the Bishops of the greatest Sees may not compare, least of all the Bishops
of Rome, of whom their own creature Platina in vitis Pontif. Hic Pontifex
nihil memoria dignum reliquit: hic pontifex, nisi podagram habuisset, omnind
ignoraretur.
Platina has often nothing to say, but that he can say nothing: This Pope,
says he, left nothing behind him worth memory. Well fare this Popes gout, but
for it he had gone out of the world without any notice taken of him. Baron.
tom. 10. ad ann 900. Intrudebantur in Petri sedem meretricum Amasii
pseudo-Pontifices, qui non sunt, nisi ad consignanda tempora in Catalogo
Romanorum Pontificum scripti.
Baronius himself, who received a Cardinals cap, to burnish the Popes triple
golden Mitre, reckons himself up a dicker of Popes, who served for nothing but
as ciphers to fill up the number of Bishops, or Chronologicall marks to
design the times. But I am afraid, lest I shall lose my self in this
Wilderness of Ziph; and therefore I will make haste out of it, and come into
the rode of my Text.

They that seek my soul to destroy it, shall go, etc.

Epitasis of all his troubles, and Crisis of all his affairs, and the height
of his hope in the depth of misery, ought to settle fast the anchor of our hope
in all the surges of tentations. We see in him what is the carriage of Gods
Saints in their greatest extremities. They never cast away the buckler of their
faith, but lift up their hearts and hands to the God of their salvation, and
hope even above hope in him, who is able to save beyond all means. Thus
resolute Martin Luther, when he had stirred up the whole world against him, and
there was no other appearance, but that the doctrine of the Gospel should have
been stifled in the cradle, flies to his God, lays hold on him by faith, and
offers violence unto him by prayer, and never leaves wrestling with him,
till he received comfort from him, and rising up cheerfully from his devotion,
comes out of his closet triumphantly to his fellow laborers, saying: Vicimus;
We have overcome: at which time Sleidan in com. sui temporis. Vicimus.
Sleidan observes, that there came out a Proclamation from Charles the fifth,
that none should be farther molested for the profession of the Gospel. What
speak I of a noble Champion of Christ? Numa Pompilius a Heathen King of the
Romans, when news was brought him of his enemies, that they were at hand ready
to surprise him, put the messenger off with this memorable speech: Plutarch.
apoph. and in vit. Numae.
(...), What tell you me of dangers or enemies? do you not see that I am about
sacrificing to God? Numa his confidence was paralleled by Raleigh hist. of the
World. c. 6. lib. 3.
Pausanias the Lacedemonian General, who at Platea, when his Army was
overtaken by the enemies horse, and overwhelmed with flights of arrows; as
thick as hail, quietly sat still, not making any defense or resistance, till
the sacrifices for victory were happily ended; yea, though many were hurt and
slain before any good sign appeared in the enirals. But as soon as he had
found good tokens of victory, he arose, and with excellent courage received the
charge of the Persians, slew Mardonius that commanded in chief, and many
thousands of the Barbarians. Did Heathen Religion put such courage, and breed
such confidence in the worshippers of Idols, that they feared no danger while
they were about their superstitious rites? and shall not true Religion beget
more noble resolutions in us, who have God bound by promise to deliver us, when
we faithfully crave his succor and assistance? Will he not glorify Psalm.
51.15.
himself by delivering us in time of trouble, who calls upon us, to call
upon him, to this end: Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shall glorify me? Wherefore, as the Athenians, when they were
in greatest danger at sea, accustomably cast out the great anchor called the
holy Anchor. Whence Eras. adag. ex Lucia. Sacram Anchoram solvere dicimur,
quando ad extremum praesidium confugimus.
grew the Proverb, (...); so when we are tossed with waves of persecution,
and so overwhelmed with violence of tentation, that we are ready to sink in
despair, let us lift up our hands to God, and cast anchor in heaven; and
though we see no means at all to subsist, yet still hang upon Gods
providence. It is scarce possible, that we should be put to a greater plunge
than David was in this wilderness, who having but a handful of men, and most
of them hunger-starved, or fainting for want of water to quench their thirst,
was surrounded by Saul's royal Army; yet in this deplorate, and almost
desperate estate, after parley with God by prayer, shall I say he conceived
hope of delivery? nay, he assures himself of the Crown, and in a manner
insulteth over his enemies, as if they were already under his feet, saying:
They that seek my soul to destroy it, shall go into the lowest parts of the
earth. They shall cast him, etc. that is, they that go about to cast me down
from my high throne of Majesty, shall fall low themselves; they who seek to
divest me of my royal Purple and Diadem, shall be clothed with confusion as
with a garment: they who hunt after me, and would make a prey of me, shall be
themselves a portion for Foxes: they that seek my soul to ruin it, shall
down themselves; They shall cast him down. in Hypothesi contain a prophecy
of Saul's bloody end, and the desolation of his Army on the mountains of
Gilboa; but in Thesi, a general judgment of God upon the wicked, whom he
entangleth in their own malice, and punishes with their own sin, and
brings to confusion by their own order. Hesiod. (...) l. 1. Sibi ipsi mala
fabricat homo, qui alteri fabricat, and malum consilium consultori pessimum.

Which Verses of the profane Poet may be thus translated, and they become
sacred Oracles: The Psalm. 7.15, 16.
ungodly shall be trapped in the works of his own hands: he made a pit, and
dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made; his mischief shall
return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his
own pate. For it is just with God to mete to the wicked their own measure, as
he did to the accusers of Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego, who were burned in
the fire of that furnace which they had caused to be Daniel 3.22.
heat seven times more than ordinary for those three noble Confessors. And to
the traducers of Daniel, who were cast to the Lions, which they kept Daniel

fasting, on set purpose, that they might make but one morsel of the Prophet.
And to Ester 7.10.
Haman, who had the honor to be hanged on that high gallows, to which he
would have preferred Mordecai. And to Judges 1.7.
Adonibezeck, who when his thumbes were cut off by Judah, beshrewed his own
fingers, saying: Threescore and ten Kings, having their thumbes and great toes
cut off, gathered their meat under my table: As I have done, so God has
requited me. All ages yield examples in the like kind, insomuch that the
Heathen themselves have taken notice of Gods using the wickeds mete-wand, to
measure out their own ruin. Thraseus instructing Busirus how to expiate the
wrath of the gods, by the effusion of strangers blood, was first himself
sacrificed, and constrained to write a probatum est under that conclusion with
his own blood: Ovid. de art. l. 1.
Cum Thraseus Busirin adit, monstratque piari
hospitis effusi sanguine posse deum;
Illi Busiris, fies Jovis hostia primus
inquit, and Aegypto tu dabis hospes aquam.


What Puny in the Schools has not read Ovids golden Motto upon Perillus his
brazen Bull: Ovid ibid. Et Phalaris tauro violenti membra Perilli, Torruit
infoelix, imbuit author opus.
-- nec enim lex justior ulla est,
Quam necis artifices art perire sua.
There can be no juster law, than that the devisers of man's ruin should rue
their own devices, and that the inventers of new deaths should dye by their
own inventions. Sciron Plutarch. in Theseo.
the Giant, that sat upon the cleft of a high rock, and kicked down all that
scrambled up to it into the sea, was himself served in the like manner by
Theseus, who coming behind him, push't him down with his foot into the deep.
And Termerus, who had a strange fashion of beating out men's brains, by playing
at hard head with them, in the end met with his match at that barbarous sport,
and lost the little brain he had, his skull being broken by Hercules. What
should I relate the tragedy of an agent of Pope Beno Cardinalis devita and gest
Hildeb.
Hildebrands, who standing upon a planke in the roof of a Church in Rome, and
taking up a huge stone to cast down upon the Emperor, when he was at his
devotion, by the weight of the stone and his own, the planke brake under him,
and he fell down into the floor, having his brains struck out by the
rolling of that stone upon him? Or of Laurentius Medices, who having fitted a
flesh-baite for Bodin l. 4. de rep.
Alexander Medices, and as he was greedily catching at it, being naked and
disarmed, set a desperate villain, in the habit of a Masquer, to stabbe him
with a Stilletto; and himself was shortly after stilletoed at Venice, by a
suborned Traitor at a Masque, in the habit of a Whiffler? The ancient Romans
glanced at this retaliation in their sacrifices to Ceres and Bacchus, to whom
they offered Swine and Goats, because these of all creatures most annoy corn
and wine: Ovid. fast. l. 1. and Martial l. 13. cui nomen Xen. Lascivum pecus
and viridi non utile Baccho, dat poenas, nocuit nam tener ille Deo.
Prima Ceres avidae gavisa est sanguine porcae
ulta suas merita caede nocentis opes.
Rode caper vitem, tamen hinc cum stabis ad aras,
in tua quod spargi cornua possit, erit.
I will not charge your memory with more examples at this present than of Pope
Bodin. l. 6. de rep.
Alexander the sixth, who was poisoned in that very cup, through a mistake, and
with that very potion, which he prepared for the Cardinals of the opposite
faction: and of the Suet. in Jul. Caes.
conspirators against Julius Caesar in the Senate, who most of them were slain
with the same daggers numero, wherewith they had stabbed him before: and of
Saul, who fell upon that sword of his, which he sought to draw through David's
bowels; as he here prophesies of him: They shall cause him or his blood to run
out like water by the hand of the sword, (viz.) his own sword.

And they shall be a portion for Foxes.

Beasts were given to men for their food, Unnatural punishment for unnatural
crimes.
but here men are given to beasts for a prey. A lamentable spectacle to see the
vilest of all creatures ravenously feast themselves with the flesh of the
noblest; and irrespectively hale and tear in pieces the casket, which whilome
enclosed the richest jewel in the world. Is it not against the law of Nature,
that men should become beasts meat; yea, the meat of such beasts as are
carrion, and not man's meat? Questionless it is: yet Nature gives her consent
to this kind of punishment of unnatural crimes. For it is consonant to reason,
that the law of Nature should be broken in their punishment, who brake it in
their sin; that they who devoured men like beasts, should be devoured of
beasts like men: that they, who with their hands offered unnatural violence to
their Sovereign, should suffer the like by the claws and teeth of wild
beasts, their slaves: that they, who bare a Fox in their breast in their life,
should been tombed in the belly of a Fox at their death.

Saint August in Psalm. 62 Jud ei ideo voluerunt Christum ^ccidere ne terram
perderent; ideo terram perdiderunt, quia Christum occiderunt: quia repulerant
Agnum, and elegerunt Vulpem, ideo praeda Vulpium facti sunt.
Austin, expounding this whole prophecy of Christ, yields a special reason
of this judgment of God, by which the Jews were condemned to Foxes. The
Jews, says he, therefore killed Christ, that they might not lose their
country; but indeed they therefore lost their country, because they killed
Christ: because they refused the Lamb, and chose Herod the Fox before him,
therefore by the just retribution of the Almighty, they were allotted to the
Foxes for their portion. Notwithstanding this allusion of Saint Austin to Foxes
in special, Jansenius and other Expositors extend this grant in my Text to all
wild beasts and fowls, which are, as it were, in patent with the Fox, and
have full power and liberty given them to seize upon the corpse of Traitors to
God and their Country. But Foxes bear the name, because they abound in those
parts, where was such store of them, that Sampson in a short time with a wet
finger caught three hundred, so that upon the matter, they shall be a portion
for Foxes, is all one with that doom in the Hom. Il. 1.
Poet: -- (...),
(...).
They shall be exposed to the teeth of every cruel beast, and to the bill and
talons of every ravenous foul.

I might insist upon the several branches of this Scripture with delight and
profit, but because the occasion of our meeting at this present is rather to
offer unto God the fruits of our devotion for his Majesty's and our enemies
destruction, than to gather fruits of knowledge from Scripture for our
instruction; I descend from the general explication of the whole, to the
particular application of the parts: and first, I will show you how this
prophecy, according to the several members thereof, was accomplished in Christ
David's Lord, then in David the Lords Christ, and last of all in King James our
David.

Saint Austin, Saint Jerome, Arnobius, and almost all the ancient Interpreters
of this prophetical Psalm, understand the letter spiritually of Christ; on
the other side, Calvin, Musculus, Mollerus, and others understand the spirit
literally of David. I know no reason why we may not spell them together, and of
two make one perfect and complete interpretation of this Scripture. Wherefore
to avoid vain jangling, where the golden bells of Aaron may be orderly rung,
and distinctly heard; for the literal exposition, I accord with the later
Interpreters, yet bear a part with the Ancients in their spiritual descant
upon the ground of the letter; the rather, because David is a known type of
Christ: and therefore by the law of contraries, Saul and his host of Satan or
Antichrist, and their infernal troops; but especially, because (as Cal^in.
epist. ad Fran. gallo. reg. Nusquam legimus reprehensos quod nimium de font
aquae vivae hauserint.
Calvin piously observes) that we never read of any blamed for drawing too
much water out of the Well of life; so it is most certain, that we cannot
offend in ascribing too much honor to the King of glory. Then take the cliffe
as you please, the notes will follow accordingly; if you take it higher from
Christ, thus the notes follow: They that seek my soul to destroy it, that is,
Herod and Pilate, Scribes and Pharisees, Rulers and people that conspire
against the Lord, and against his anointed, to take away his life from the
earth, they I say shall go into the lowest parts of the earth; that is, the
nethermost hell, without repentance: they shall make him run out like water;
that is, Pilat, who in discontent was driven to slay himself; as also did
Saul, to whom the letter points: or, as we read in my text, They shall fall
by the edge of the sword; that is, the Nation of the Jews shall fall by the
sword of the Romans: who shall make such a slaughter of them at Jerusalem,
where they crucified Christ, that the channels shall run with gore blood, and
the streets be strowed with dead carcasses, left unburied for a prey to the
fowls of heaven, and every ravenous beast: but the King, viz. the King of
glory, and Prince of Peace, Christ Jesus, shall rejoice in God, and triumph at
the right hand of his Father; and every one that swears by him, and puts
his trust in him, shall glory in these his victories. But the mouth of all
Jews and Gentiles, Turks and Infidels, Atheists and Idolaters, that belch out
blasphemies against him, shall be stopped when he shall come in the glory of his
Father, with his elect Angels, and sit in judgment upon quick and dead.
Hieron epist ad Heliod. Tunc quod vocem inbae pavebit terra cum populis, and tu
gaudebis. Judicaturo Domino lugubre mundus immugiet, tribus ad tribum pectora
ferient, Potentissimi quo^dam reges nudo latere pulpitabunt, exhibebitur cum
prole sua vere tunc ignitus Jupiter, adducetur and cum suis stultus Plato
discipulis, Aristotelis argumenta non proderunt. Tunc tu rusticanus and pauper
exultabis, and ridebis, and dices, ecce crucifixus Deus meus ecce Judex qui
obvolutus pannis in praesepio vagiit: hic est ille operarii and quaestuariae
filius, hic qui matris gestatus sinu hominem Deus fugit in Egyptum, hic
vestitus coccino, hic sentibus coronatus: cerne manus Judae e quas fixeras:
cerne latus Roman quod foderas.
Then at the sound of the last trumpe the earth shall tremble with the
inhabitants, but thou O Christian shall rejoice. When thy Lord comes to judge,
the world shall roar hideously, all the kindreds of the earth shall smite
their breasts; the most puissant Kings shall appear without their guard,
panting for fear: Jupiter himself (the chief Idol of all the heathen) with
all his offspring, shall be seen all in true fire: foolish Plato shall be
brought with his disciples; Aristotle's sophistry shall stand him in no stead.
Then thou poor and simple country swain shall leap for joy, and say, Behold
my God who was crucified, behold the Judge who sometimes wrapped in swaddling
clothes cried in a manger: this is the Carpenters son, this is he who borne
in his mothers arms being God fled from man into Egypt: this he who was clad
in purple, and crowned with thorns: see O Jew the hands which thou nailedst:
view O Roman the side which thou diggedst with thy spear: behold O Jew the
head which thou prickedst with thorns, now compassed with radiant beams:
behold the face thou defiledst with spittle, shining brighter than the Sun:
behold the hands thou woundedst with Iron nails, holding a rod of Iron, and
bruising his enemies like a potters vessel: behold O Roman the naked side
which thou piercedst with a spear, now guarded with a troop of Angels with
their polaxes: behold the body thou strippedst stark naked, clothed with
light as with a garment. In a word, behold him whom thou esteemedst the scorn
of the earth, made now the glory of the heavens, in a triumphant march, with
millions of Saints and Angels, riding on bright clouds, as it were fiery
chariots, through the air, to execute speedy vengeance upon all his enemies,
and to take up all the elect with him into heaven: Apoc. 22.20.
Etiam sic veni Domine Jesu; Even so come Lord Jesu, come quickly.

You have heard how sweet and heavenly the music is, if you take the highest
cliffe from Christ; if you take the middle from David, thus the notes follow;
They that seek my soul to destroy it, that is, my bloodthirsty enemies,
shall go into the lowest parts of the earth; that is, either enter into their
graves, or hide themselves in caves of the earth: they shall make him to run
out like water; that is, cause Saul my capital and mortal enemy to spill his
own blood, by falling upon his own sword.

And they shall be a portion for foxes. This clause of the prophecy was not
fulfilled in Saul his person, nor his sons, for 1 Samuel 31.12.13.
their flesh was burnt and their bones buried under a tree at Jabesh: but in
his servants and soldiers, which mortally wounded on the mounts of Gilboa, and
being not able to help themselves, nor having any to bury them after they had
breathed out their last gasp, fell to the foxes share: and therefore David
purposely alters the number, saying not they shall cast him down, and he
shall be a portion for foxes; but they shall be a portion for foxes, as in the
truth of the story afterward they fell to the foxes commons. Now after the
death first of Saul, and the discomfiture of his royal army, and the
overthrow afterward of the Philistims, and destruction of all his enemies
round about; King David, sitting safely and quietly in his throne, full of joy
and comfort, breaks forth into a Psalm of thanksgiving to God for his
wonderful victories and strange deliverances, and all the loyal subjects of
Judah and Israel bear a part with him in it: whereat all those that before had
falsely traduced his person, or impugned his right to his crown, were put to
silence and shame.

Thus have I set the tune in my text to the middle key also, and as you hear
the music is sweet; if you will have the patience to hear it once more set
to the lowest key, you will all perceive that every note in it conforteth not
only with our voices, but our thoughts and affections at this present. I have
showed you how this prophecy in my text was fulfilled in Christ, David's Lord,
and secondly, in David the Lords Christ: may it please you out of your love to
him, to whose honor you have dedicated this feast, to stretch out your
patience to the length of the hour, and I shall briefly exemplify the same in
our Isreal's David. To resume then the words of this Scripture, and by the parts
of it to draw the lineaments of that narration, which shall serve for my
conclusion. First, I will relate unto you the attempt of the conspirators the
Earl Gowrie and Alexander Ruthen his brother, and their accomplices, by the
occasion of these words, They that seek my soul to destroy it. Secondly, the
event, by occasion of the words following, shall go to the lowest parts of the
earth, etc.

They that seek my soul to destroy it. Were there ever any such? or are there
any at this day? Does he breathe that would go about to stop the Sen. de

breath which so many thousands draw? Does the Sun give light to any that would
go about to quench the light of Israel? can the earth bear any such an
ungrateful and graceless varlet, whose conscience is burdened with so heavy
and heinous a sin as Parricide in the highest degree; laying violent hands upon
the Father of his country, whom for his clemency and wisdom the world at
this day cannot parallel? Yes beloved, this has been the lot of the best
Princes that ever ware corruptible Crowns. Suet. in vita Tui.

untainted with the effusion of the least drop of blood: for ambition is a
sworn enemy to sovereignty, envy to eminency, liberty to law, disorder to
justice, faction to peace, schism to unity, heresy to true religion: whereby
it comes to pass that Princes, who are to right all men, are themselves most
wronged of all men, by misinformation of their subjects demeanours toward
them, and mis-construction of their actions, and proceedings, and affections
also toward their subjects. You will yet say, be it that the actions of
Princes are subject to censure, and their persons, though sacred, yet sometimes
lie open to violence: howsoever, if they establish their throne with judgment,
and support their scepter with equity, their innocence shall be a perpetual
guard unto them, and the arm of the Almighty shall be a buckler of steel over
them, and the love of subjects shall be a wall of brass about them; so that
the enemy shall not be able to hurt them, the sons of wickedness shall not
come near them. Notwithstanding all this, it pleases him, by whom Kings
reign, either to make Princes to walk more humbly before him, and more warily
before their subjects; or for the greater trial of their faith in greatest
distresses, or cleerer manifestation of his power in their delivery, to expose
their persons to imminent dangers, and suffer them to be led to the brinke of
destruction, and to be entangled in the snares of death. How did he suffer
Camerarius meditat. histor. c. 27.30.
Charles the fifth to ascend to the top of the Pantheon in Rome, and there to
look out of a great gallery window, where there was a desperate villain set
to take him up by the heels and throw him down headlong? How did he suffer
that stain of the French Nobility to approach near Augustus in the dangerous
passage of the Alps, with a purpose to justle him out of the narrow path into
the steep of the hill, where it was imposble to stay himself? Was not Titus
past all man's help, and given over for dead a thousand times, when scouting
out with a few to spy the enemies camp, at the siege of Jerusalem, he fell
unawares into an ambush, and was constrained to pass through a volly of darts
and arrows, cast and shot at him, whereof some fell before him, some behind
him, many on each side of him: yet by Gods mavelous protection not one
fastened on him? Was not Frederick the first at the brinke of destruction by
the river side, when a soldier took hold on him, and clasped about him to
draw him with himself into the deep and drown him? Had not Cambd. in vit. Reg.
Eliz.
Parry the means and opportunity to parley with Queen Elizabeth of famous
memory in her garden privately, with a dagger in his hand, and a dag charged?
These and many other presidents of the like nature make me the less marvel
that God should suffer Ruthwen, with a golden hook, (a pot full of Vid l.
Angl. scrip. de conjura. Gowr.
outlandish coin) to draw his Majesty through diverse chambers, which he
still locked after them, into that dismal study which was more fearful than
any Jesuits chamber of meditation; in which they shut up their desperate
instruments to crack their brains, and fit them for horrid designs. For
there are but pictures only of Devils, and Images of several kinds of death;
but here were very Devils incarnate, and death it self. Books he saw none in
this study, but those two mentioned by Sutton in vita Calig.
Suetonius, in which Caligula wrote the names of those men whose heads he meant
to take off; calling the one of them, which was longer, gladium, the sword; the
other, which was shorter, pugionem, the dagger. The subject he was now to
meditate upon was a bloody assacinate, and the points he was to handle, no
other than the sharp ends of swords and rapiers. Made then he was to believe
that he should there take an outlandish man, with great store of treasure; but
he found an armed man, ready to take away that from him which was more precious
unto him than all the jewels in the world. Here we see what a sovereign care
the Highest has over sovereign Princes his vicegerents on earth, and what a
terror sacred Majesty strikes into the hearts of barbarous and bloody
traitors. The Italian varlet had not the power to lift at Charles the fifth:
with a lift only he had thrown him out of the window. The French miscreant
had not the power to push at Augustus: with a push only he had broken his neck
down the steep Alps. Parry had not the power to draw the pin of his
fire-lock: upon the moving but of a pin the dag had gone off in his hand, and
the Queen had been shot through the heart. Parry's dag fell out of his hand,
and Hendersons dagger stuck in his hand; he could no more stir it than the
soldier at Minternum, who drew upon Caius Marius, but was not able to strike a
stroke, nor make a thrust at him.

Lucan de bell. Pha^sal.
-- primo nam caedis in ictu
Diriguit, ferrumque manu torpente remisit.
Howbeit, though Hendersons faint heart and benumbed hand would not serve him
to act his bloody part; yet the Devil so hardened Ruthwen, that he took out
the other dagger, and set the point thereof at his Majesty's royal breast. And
now if ever any lay inter Eras. adag.
sacrum and saxum, between the axe and the block, or Theo^ri. in diosc^^.
(...), upon the edge of the razor, or in ipsis fati Cic. Catilin. ^^ai. 2.
faucibus, in the very chops of destiny, or jaws of death it self; at the
point lay the hope then, and now the joy and life of us all. Alone, in a remote
place, his servans and attendants barred from him by many doors locked and
bolted, himself destitute of all weapons, between two Conspirators, with a
poynard bent to his heart. O King live for ever, is not thy God whom thou
servest able to deliver thee from this peril of death? Could he not snatch
thee out of the paw of the Lion? Could he not have struck down both the
Conspirators dead to the floor with a thunderbolt from heaven, or at the least
taken away the use of Ruthwens limbs, drying up that hand that presumed to
touch the apple of his own eye, the sacred person of our Sovereign? With a
word he could, but it seemed best to his all-sweetly-disposing providence
wonderfully to preserve his Majesty, yet without a miracle. For if he had
rescued him by any such miraculous means as I named before, there had been no
occasion offered, nor place left for his Majesty's faithful servants to stake
their lives for their Master: neither had the world taken such notice of his
Majesty's rare gift of eloquence, by the force whereof, like another Cic. de
orat. l. 3.
Antonie, intentos gladios jugulo retudit, he stayed the Traitors hand, and
delayed the intended blow: first, clearing his own innocence from the
aspersion of blood in the execution of the Traitors father, by course of
justice, in his Majesty's minority; then recounting to him the many princely
favors he had conferred upon his brother, himself, and all their kindred: but
especially laying before his eyes the horror of the guilt of embruing his
hands in the blood of the Lords anointed; which said he, if my children and
subjects should not revenge, the stones out of the wall, and the beams of the
timber, conscious of such a villainy, would execute vengeance upon thee for so
unnatural, barbarous, and bloody an act. In fine he promised in the word of a
King, pardon for all the violence he had hitherto offered him, if he would yet
relent and desist from his murtherous intent and attempt of spilling royal
blood. At which words Ruthwens heart, though of Adamant, began to relent and
give in; in such sort, that he gave his Majesty a time to breathe, and offer
up prayers with strong cries to the God of his salvation, who heard him in that
he feared, as you shall hear anon. In the interim, Ruthwen consults with the
Earl Gowrie his brother, and according to the Latin Eras. adag. Aspis a
vipera sumit venenum
proverb, the aspe suckes poison from the viper, wherewith he swells, and
brusling up himself, flies at his Majesty the second time to sting him to
death, and wrapping about him, begins to bind his royal hands; who nothing
appalled at the hideous shape of death within a fingers breadth of his heart,
answers like himself, that he was borne free, and would die free and unbound:
forthwith he unlooseth his hands, and with one of them clasping the Traitors
sword, with the other he grapples with him, and, after much struggling, his
Majesty draws the Traitor to the window, by which it so pleased God to
dispose for his Majesty's safety, that some of his Majesty's servants passed at
that very instant, and both heard and saw in part, in what distress his
Majesty was, and made all possible speed to rescue him: but before they could
force a way through so many doors, the King by power from above got the
Traitor under him, and drew him by maine force to the top of the staire-case;
where soon after the Kings servants, forcibly breaking through all bars,
bolts and locks, met with him, and throwing him down stairs sent him with
many wounds to his own place, verifying the letter of this prophecy in the
confusion of our David's enemies, qui quaerunt praecipitium animae meae, they
which seek the downfall of my soul, they shall go or rather tumble down
with a witness. And so I pass from the Traitors attempt to the event and
happy catastrophe, on the Kings part, of this not fained Interlude.

They shall go down. By this time as I intimated but now, the Kings servants
partly made, and partly found their way into the study, rushing in to save the
life of their Sovereign; where they had no sooner dispatched one of the
brothers Alexander Ruthwen, but the other brother the Earl, with seven of his
servants well appointed, encountreth them. The skirmish grows hot between
them; these fighting for their lives, they for their Sovereign; these animated
by hope, they whet on by desperation, After many wounds given and received on
both sides, they of the Kings part, according to the words of the tenth verse,
cast him down; or, as it is in the Hebrew, make his blood spin or run out like
water on the ground: his, I say, the arch-Traitor the Earl Gowrie, who may be
compared to Saul David's chief enemy; whose downfall the spirit in the
pronoune in the singular number him points at, in many respects, but
especially in this, that he took counsel of the Devil to murder the Lords
Anointed. For as Saul conferred with the Witch at Endor before he put himself
into the field which he watered with his blood, so the Earl Gowrie, before he
entered into this Acheldamah field of blood, pitched by himself, he made the
Devil of his counsel, and was found with many magic characters about him
when he fell by the edge of the sword.

If any man question how it could so fall out that Alexander Ruthwen, being
more nimble, strong, and expert in wrestling, and having many ways advantage
on his Majesty, should not throw him down, or get him under him; I answer out
of the words immediately going before my text, dextra Jehovae sustentabat eum,
the right hand of the Lord supported him the King: by whose special providence
it was ordered, that his Majesty's servants should pass by the window at the
very moment when his Majesty looked out; as also, that some of them should
find that blind way by the turne-pecke into the study which the Earl Gowrie
caused to be new made for this his divellish enterprise. Therefore his
Majesty, as soon as the bloody storm was blown over, kneeled down in the
midst of all his servants, and offered up the calves of his lips to the God
of his life; promising a perpetual memory of this his deliverie, and
professing that he assured himself that God had not preserved him so
wonderfully for naught, but that he reserved him for some greater work and
service to his Church, as we see this day. There remains yet one clause in
my text; And the mouth of every one that speaks lies shall be stopped: and
answerably an appendix to the narration of the conspiracy of the Gowries, for
stopping the mouths of all that shall call in question the truth of that
relation. Which besides the conscience of his Majesty, the deposition of his
servants, the public justice of the Parliament of Scotland, the solemn piety
and devotion of the Churches of great Britain and Ireland, was sixteen
years after the plotting thereof, and eight years after the acting confirmed
by the public, free, and voluntary confession of Vid. a book entitled, the
examination of G. Sprot, published with a learned preface to it by G.A. Dr. D.
and Dean of Winchester.
George Sprot, arraigned and executed at Edinburgh for it.

Thus have I fitted each member of this prophecy to the several parts of the
story of his Majesty's deliverance as on this day: between which there is
such good correspondencie, that the prophecy seems text to the story, and
the story a commentary on the prophecy. Observe I beseech you the harmony of
them, and let your heart dance with joy at every strain.

1. The first is, They that seek my soul to destroy it, shall go down, etc.
This was exemplified, and according to the letter accomplished in Alexander
Ruthwen, who sought the ruin of our David, and was himself thrown down the
stairs, and after part of him into the lowest parts of the earth, a deep pit,
into which his bowels were cast.

2. The second is, They shall cast him down by the edge of the sword. This was
accomplished in the Earl Gowrie, whom the Kings servants smote in the study
with the edge of the sword, that he died and fell at their feet.

3. The third is, And they shall be a portion for foxes; that is, lie unburied
for a prey to the fowls of heaven, and beasts of the earth: this was
accomplished in all the Traitors, who were according to the Laws of the
kingdom hanged, drawn and quartered, and their quarters set up upon the most
eminent parts of the City, where the fowls preyed upon them till they dropped
down to the ground, and were made an end of by some ravenous beasts.

4. The fourth is, The King shall rejoice in God. This was literally verified
in our King, who joyful after he was plucked out of the jaws of death, gave
public thanks to God, and ascribed the whole glory of his deliverance and
victory over his enemies to his gracious goodness; and in memory of this so
great a benefit, commanded this feast, which we now celebrate, to be solemnly
kept in all his Dominions yearly.

5. The fifth is, And all that swear by him, that is, all which worship the
true God, the God of our Jacob; or all that swear to him, that is, allegiance
to his Majesty, shall glory. This, as it was accomplished in other
congregations, so is it in us here present, assembled to glory in the Lord for
this wonderful delivery of their then, and now also our Sovereign.

6. The sixth and last is, And the mouth of all that speak lies shall be
stopped. This was also fulfilled by the means of George Sprot, who by his
pious behavior, and penitent confession at his death, and a sign which he
promised to show after his breath should be stopped, and accordingly performed
(after he had hanged a great while, clapping his hands above his head) stopped
the mouth of all such as before spoke lies against the truth of the precedent
relation. To the lively expression whereof, I have borrowed, as you see, David's
princely characters, and set the press, placing each letter in his rank, and
part in his order. What remains but that I pray to God by his spirit to
stamp them in our hearts, and so imprint them in our memories, that he that
runs may read our thankfulness to God for this deliverance, and confidence
in his future protection of our Sovereigns person, and love and loyalty to
his Majesty, whom God has so strangely saved from the sword, to save the
sword from us; that in peace and safety he might receive and sway the Scepter
of these Kingdoms of great Britain and Ireland. Which long may he, with
much prosperity and honor, to the glory of God, and propagation of the truth,
liberty, and safety of the Church and Commonwealth, exceeding joy and
comfort of all his friends, and remarkable shame and confusion of his
implacable enemies. So be it. Deo patri, etc.

THE LORD PROTECTOR OF PRINCES; OR DEUS ET REX, GOD AND THE KING. A Sermon
appointed to be preached before his Grace at Croydon, August 5. 1620. THE SIXTH
SERMON.
PSALM. 21.1. The King shall joy in thy strength, O Lord: and in thy salvation
how greatly shall he rejoice? Or, (as we read in the Bishops Bible)

The King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of
thy salvation.


THat manifold, or (to make a new compound to translate a compound) in the
Original Ephesians. 3.10. (...).
multivarious wisdom and goodness of God, which has illustrated the
firmament with variety of stars, some more, some less glistering and
glorious; enameled the meadows with choice of flowers, some more, some less
beautiful and fragrant; enriched the sands of the Sea with pearl, some more,
some less orient; and veins of the earth with metals, some more, some less
precious: has also decked and garnished the Calendar of the Church with
variety of Feasts, some more, some less holy and solemn. You may observe a
kind of Hierarchy among them; some have a pre-eminence over the rest, which we
call greater and higher Feasts. Among which this day challenges his place, on
which we refresh the memory of his Majesty's rescue out of the profane and
impious hands of the Earl Gowry and Alexander Ruthwen. A pair of unnatural
brethren; brethren in nature, and brethren in a most barbarous and unnatural
attempt against their Sovereign the Lords anointed: brethren by blood, and
brethren also in blood: who by the just judgment of God cleansed that study
with their own blood, which they would have for ever stained by the effusion
there of the Royal blood of the most innocent Prince that ever sat on that or
this Throne: whom almighty God seems not so much to have preserved from those
imminent dangers he then escaped, as reserved for these unvaluable blessings we
now enjoy by the prorogation of his life; enlarging of his Scepter and
propagation of his Issue. In his life the life of our hope is revived; in his
Scepter the Scepter of Christ is extended; in his stock the root of Jesse is
propagated, and shall, I hope, flourish to the end of the world. For this cause
the King shall rejoice, etc. he shall rejoice in thee, we in him; he in thy
strength, we in his safety; both in thy salvation. Here is God assisting, and
the King trusting: God saving, and the King rejoicing: God blessing, and the
King praising: lastly, the King desiring, and God satisfiing his desires to the
full, as you may see through the whole Psalm. In this verse you may discern
three remarkable conjugations or couples. 1. God is joined with the King. 2.
Strength with confidence. 3. Salvation with exceeding great joy. And thus they
depend each of other.
1. The King of God. 2. Confidence of strength. 3. Joy of salvation.
1. God exalts the King. 2. Strength begets confidence. 3. Salvation
brings with it exceeding joy.
1. God is above the King. 2. Salvation is above strength. 3. Exceeding joy
above confidence.


If the King seek God, in him he shall find strength, and in his strength
salvation, and in his salvation exceeding great joy. Mark the word King; it
stands as a cliffe before a song, which directs the singers how to tune the
notes, and lift up or depresse their voices. If the King stand here as a lower
cliffe for David, then strength is aid, salvation victory, rejoicing
thanksgiving: but if the word King be set as an higher cliffe for Christ, then
strength here is omnipotency, salvation redemption of mankind, rejoicing the
exaltation of the humane nature to the highest degree of celestial glory and
happiness. This heavenly Manna of Evangelicall doctrine which the Fathers
find within the golden pot, that is, the inward sense of the words; the Jewish
Rabbis note to be carved in the outside of the letter: to speak yet somewhat
plainer, that mind and meaning which the Christian Expositors make of the
words, by referring them to the truth whereof David was a type, they gather
from the very characters, for (...) transposed, is (...), the Anagram as it
were of the word which signifies to rejoice is Mesiach, that is, Christ, or
the anointed.

Now the title of King is attributed to Christ in Scriptures sometimes
absolutely, sometimes with additions; but such as make him more absolute,
exalting his crown as far above all corruptible crowns as the heaven is
above the earth. For his style given by the sacred Heralds is King immortal,
King of Heaven, King of righteousness, Prince of peace, Lord of life, Lord of
quick and dead, Lord of all, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. This heavenly
crown in glory, as much obscuring the luster of earthly Diadems as the Sun
does the least blinking star, belongs to our head Christ Jesus by a
threefold right: 1. Of birth. 2. Of donation. 3. Of conquest.


His birth gives it him; for he is the first born of the Father, and therefore
Gal. 4.1.
heir of all things, and Lord of all.

By gift also he has it. Psalm. 2.8. Luke 1.32. The Lord God shall give unto
him the Throne of his Father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob
for ever.
Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

It is his also by conquest, for he has overcome the world, John 16.33. he
has conquered hell and death, and has the keys of both, Rev. 1.18. If you
demand where his throne is, I answer, above at the right hand of his Father,
Psalm. 110.1. below in the hearts of all the faithful, whom he rules by the
Scepter of his word.

Thus much for the cliffe, I set now to the notes, which are either 1. In rule.
2. In space.


1 The note in space I take from the coherence of this Psalm with the former;
the last words of the former Psalm are Salvum fac Regem, Lord save the King,
or Save Lord, let the King hear when we call: the first of this, Exultabit Rex
in salute, The King shall rejoice in thy salvation. That which there the Church
prays for the King, here the King praises God for. The Chuch prays God
there, ver. 1. The name of the God of Jacob defend thee, send thee help, and
strengthen thee out of Sion. And ver. 4. grant thee thy hearts desire, and
fulfill all thy mind: and does not the King in this Psalm trace the former
footsteps, and follow the same notes in this Psalm of thanksgiving? The King
shall rejoice in thy strength, ver. 1. And, thou have given him his hearts
desire, ver. 2. What instance I in diverse Psalms? In the same Psalm, for the
most part, in the beginning the Prophet sows in tears, and in the end
reapeth in joy; in the beginning he complains, in the ending he prayseth; in
the beginning he cries for sorrow, in the end he sings for joy; in the
beginning we have a storm of passion, in the end the sunshine of Gods favor.
The countenance of the Prophet, drawn to the life in this book of Psalms,
resembles the picture of Diana at Delphos, quae intrantibus tristis,
exeuntibus hilaris videbatur, the face whereof seemed to frown upon all at
their coming in, but to smile upon them at their going out. Such a copy of
David's countenance we have Psalm. 6. lowering at the first verse, Lord rebuke
me not in thine anger, etc. but clearing up at ver. 8. Depart from me ye
workers of iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. How
dolefully does the 22. Psalm begin? My God, my God, why have thou forsaken
me? but how sweetly does it conclude from ver. 22. to the end? I will declare
thy Name to my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee,
etc. O the wonderful power and efficacy of prayer, which in a moment pierces
the clouds, and brings back a blessing before we can imagine it is gone out
of our lips! Like a piece of Ordnance highly mounted it battreth the walls of
heaven before the report thereof be heard on earth. No natural agent produces
any effect before it self be produced: nothing brings forth before it self
is brought forth: yet prayer works oftentimes before it is made, and brings
forth some good effect before it self is perfectly conceived: for God
understands the thoughts before the notions are framed; he hears the heart
dictating, before the tongue, like the pen of a ready writer, copieth out our
requests.

Now if the prayer of one righteous man prevails so much with the Omnipotent,
how much more the united prayers of the whole Church? If one trumpet sound so
loud in the ears of the Almighty, how much more a consort of all the silver
trumpets of Sion sounded together? If one sigh is of force to drive our bark
to the wished haven, how much more a gale of sighs breathed from a million of
Gods afflicted servants? What judgment cannot so many hands lifted up bear
off from us? what blessing are they not able to pull down from heaven?
Wherefore, as the whole Synagogue with one mouth prayed God for their King, so
according to Saint Paul's precept, the whole Christian Church offered up their
united devotions for the Roman Emperor. The matter and form of their prayer
is set down by Tertul. in apol. Manibus expansis, quia innocuis, capite nudo,
quia non erubescimus, precantes semper sumus pro omnibus Imperatoribus, vitam
illis prolixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, exercitus fortes, Senatum
fidelem, populum probum, orbem quietum.
Tertullian; With hands spread abroad, because innocent; and bare head, because
not blushing, we are always praying for all Emperors, that God would grant
unto them a long life, a happy reign, a safe house, victorious armies, a
faithful council, a loyal people, and a peaceable world. And if according to
Saint Cypr. de laps.
Cyprians passionate admonition we would join publicly our prayers to their
prayers, and our tears to their tears, and our sighs to their sighs, who
groan under the heavy yoke of heathenish or antichristian tyranny; who
knows whether God would not change the face of Christendom, and not only
wipe blood from the body, but also all tears from the eyes of his most
disconsolate Spouse?

Thus much of the notes in space; the notes in rule are specially

In thy strength.
1. That the only security of Princes and States is in the strength of the
Almighty.

The King shall rejoice in thy salvation.
2. That God holds a special hand over Sovereign Princes.

3. That Princes mightily defended and safely preserved by the arm of God must
thankfully acknowledge this singular favor, and deliver their deliverances to
after ages, that the children yet unborne may praise the Lord as we do this
day.

1. That Princes and states have no safe repose but under the shadow of the
Almighty, I need not allege any one Psalm for proof: it is the burden
almost of every song. Not a string in David's harp but sounds out this tune,
briefly, Psalm. 2.12.
happy are they that put their trust in him. Psalm. 4.8.
Thou Lord only make me to dwell in safety. Psalm. 20.7.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the Name of
the Lord our God. Psalm. 21.7.
The King trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he shall
not be moved. Psalm. 44.6.8.
I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. In God we boast
all the day long: and praise thy Name for ever. Selah. Upon this note how
excellent does he divide? Psalm. 18.2.
The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer: my God, my strength
in whom I will trust, my buckler, the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
Xen. Cyr. p. ed. (...), etc.
It is not the golden Scepter we see Princes lean upon that supporteth them,
it is the loyalty of their loving subjects which bears them up: withdraw this
golden Scepter from them they cannot stand. Plin. in panegyr. Satellitium
principis ipsius innocentia optimum munimentum munimento non egere.
The best guard of a Prince, says Pliny, is his own innocence, the best
defense and munition to need none, for arms are provoked by arms; neither can
a Prince be guarded from his own guard but by his buckler of faith, and the
right hand of the Almighty: Dextra mihi deus est, My right hand is my god says
he in the Poet falsely and blasphemously: but David truly and most
religiously, The Lord is the strength of my right hand. Psalm. 127.1.
Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except
the Lord keep the City, the watchman waketh but in vain. Except the Lord
protect the royal person of a Prince, the Statesman counsels, the Captain
fights, the Guard waits but in vain: no magazine of treasure, no arsenall
of armor, no fleet by Sea, no forces by land, no alliance with neighbor
Princes, no allegiance of subjects can secure their persons for a moment.

Those in the bath who forsake their guides and will venture to go of
themselves are often drowned: and travelers who refuse or distrust their
convoy when they pass through theevish places, dismissing them or stealing
away from them, for the most part by escaping seeming danger, fall into
certain danger: so it fares with them who rely not upon the protection of the
Almighty, but seek other help, aid and support, from the arm of flesh, or
the brain of worldly Politicians. Jer. 17.5.
Cursed is he who makes flesh his arm, and trusts not in the Lord his God.
To the truth of which verdict the greatest Potentates in the world have
subscribed with their own blood. Nebuchadnezzar trusted in his City Babel,
and it became his Babel, that is, his confusion. Xerxes trusted in his
multitude of men, his multitude encumbred him. Darius in his wealth, his wealth
sold him. Eumenes in the valor of his regiment called the Silver-shields, his
Silver-shields bound him and delivered him to Antigonus. Roboam in his young
Counselors, his young Counselors lost him the ten Tribes. Caesar in his old
Senators, the Senators conspired against him. Domitian in his guard, his
guard betrayed him. Adrian in his Physicians, his Physicians cast him away:
Multitudo medicorum perdidit Adrianum Imperat orem. These all leaned upon
Egyptian reeds, which not only brake under them, and so deceived their trust;
but also ran in to their hands and sides, and wounded them. By whom let us all
learn to distrust all means of trust and confidence, save in the continuance
of Gods favor, and the support of his power and Grace. St. Prosp. sent.
excerpt ex Aug. Qui in se stat non stat, qui se sibi sufficere confidit, ab eo
qui vere sufficit defici^.
Prosper out of St. Austine happily concludes this point; Whosoever stands
upon himself stands not; he who is confident in his own support, by this
his arrogancy loses the support of true confidence; opinion of
selfe-sufficiencie infers a deficiencie from him in 2 Cor. 3.5. Not that we
are sufficient of our selves to think any thing of our selves but our
sufficiency is of God.
whom is all our sufficiency.

I have showed you the pictures of those who have suffered shipwreck by making
worldly policy their Pilot, and committing their body and goods to those
brittle barks which I before mentioned: behold now the cheerful faces of
those who in a deluge of troubles have yet arrived to the fair havens, being
steered by the compass of Gods Word, and carried safe in the arc of divine
protection. How many mutinies against Moses? how many stratagems against
Joshuah? how many attempts against David? what preparations against Hezekiah?
what combinations against Jehosaphat? what armies against Constantine? what
fulminations from Rome, what Armadoes from Spain, what poisons, what dags and
daggers from Traitors at home against Queen Elizabeth? Yet all these were
compassed as it were with a wall of brass, and castle of Diamond, the Divine
protection. Abijah and his people joining battle with Jeroboam smote him and
all Israel, and slew five hundred thousand, and took Bethel with the Towns
thereof, and Jeshanah with the Towns thereof, and Ephraim with the Towns
thereof; and the children of Israel, though far more in number, were at that
time brought under, and the children of Judah prevailed. Why? Because they were
better soldiers? or better armed? or led by a more expert General? or because
they had advantage of the place? Nay, rather they were every way disadvantaged.
For 2 Chronicles. 13.13.
Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before
Judah and the ambushment was behind them. To put you out of doubt, the holy
Ghost yields a reason of Judahs prevailing, 2 Chronicles. 13.18.
because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers. St. Austin parallels
this wonderful victory with the like that fell out about his time. When Aug.
de Ci^. Dei l. 5. c. 23. Uno die Rhadagesus tanta celeritate victus est, ut ne
uno quidem non dicam extincto, sed ne vulnerato quidem Romano, multo amplius
quam centum millium prosternetur exercitus.
Rhadagesus King of the Goths with a puissant army environed Rome, and by
reason of the small preparations in the City no hope could be expected from
man, how did God perform the trust by his Saints reposed in him, and fought
for them in this their greatest extremity, and so discomfited the enemies,
that in one day an army of a hundred thousand was utterly defeated, not a man
of the Roman side being slain, nor so much as wounded? God loves those best
who trust him most, and he saves them above means who hope in him above hope:
as did Abraham the father of the faithful. Believe him who spoke it out of his
own experience: Psalm. 125.1.
They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion, which cannot be removed,
but abides for ever. Ps. 91.1.4.5.6.7.10. ver. 4.
He that dwells in the secret place of the most high, shall abide under the
shadow of the Almighty. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his
wings shall thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shall
not be afraid for the terror by night: 5.6.
nor for the arrow that flies by day: nor for the pestilence that walks in
darkness: nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday. A thousand shall
fall by thy side, 7.10.
and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee. There
shall no evil befall thee, nor any plague come nigh thy dwelling. Psalm. 3.8.
Salvation belongs to the Lord. Ps. 144.10.
It is he that gives salvation unto Kings who delivers David his servant
from the hurtful sword. Why is the accent upon Kings? as likewise in the words
of my text, The King shall rejoice in thy strength, exceeding glad shall He
be of thy salvation. Does not the wing of Gods provident care extend to all
his Children? are they not all safe under his feathers? They are all; yet Kings
are nearest to his breast, they receive more warmth from him, he has a
special care of them, according to my second observation:

That God takes Princes into his peculiar protection. He keeps them as the
Signet of his finger, because in them the Image of his Sovereign Majesty most
brightly shines. It concerns him in honor to mainetaine them who are his
Vicegerents upon earth. It concerns him in love to defend the defenders of
the faith, and cherish the nursing Fathers of his dearest Spouse. It concerns
him in wisdom to save them who are the breath of so many thousand nostrils;
to keep them whole who are the Sen. de clem l. 1. c 4. Ille est vinculam pe^
quod respublica cohaeret: nihil ipsa per se futura nisionus and praeda, si men's
illa imperii subtrahatur. Regeincolumi men's omnibus una, amisso rupere fidem.
bond which holds together the whole Commonwealth. In the danger of a King
is the hazard of a State, in the hazard of a State the ruin of a Church, in
the ruin of a Church Vid. Camerar. meditat. hist. c. 30. Magnos vi^os
divinitus ab insidiis saepenumero conservari.
Gods honor lies in the dust. The heathen Poet glanced at this truth, when
every where he styles Kings (...), as it were bred up and fostered in the
bosom of Jove, or rather Jehovah. Keep me, says David, as the apple of thine
eye: Who can endure the least prick in the apple of the eye? no more will God
abide his anointed to be so much as 1 Chro. 16.22.
touched: Nolite tangere unctos meos.

Is God so tender over Princes safety, and ought not they to be as tender of
his honor? Is he so gracious to them, and ought not they be as grateful to
him? The planets that receive more light from the Sun, reflect more back
again: the earth that receives rain from heaven, returns it back in
vapor: Cessat decursus donorum si cesset recursus gratiarum: red roses of our
lips, and the sweet savor of our devout meditations. Verily he deserves to
lose his garden who will not afford his Landlord a flower. Si ingratum Sen. de
been fic.
dixeris, omnia dixeris; if you call a man unthankefull you need say no more,
for you cannot say worse: whosoever deserves to be branded with a mark of
Ingratitude, has his conscience feared with a hot Iron. For what is Cic. pro
planc.
Religion, but Gratitude to God; Piety, but Gratitude to Parents; Loyalty,
but Gratitude to Princes; Charity and friendship, but gratitude to our
neighbor. Now of all men Princes are most obliged to be thankful to God,
because the beams of his favor shine most bright in their Crowns and
Scepters, he sets them in his own seat of authority, investeth them with his
own robes of majesty, armeth them with his own sword of justice, supporteth
them with his own Scepter of power, adorneth them with his own Diadem of
royal dignity, and graceth them with his own style of Deity, Ego dixi dii
estis, I have said ye are Gods, Joh. 10.34. and Psalm. 82.6.
and all of you are children of the most High. Above all therefore Princes
ought to be most grateful to God, because God has placed them in that high
condition, that all other owe duty and thankful service to them, and they to
him alone. Thanks are not thankes-worthy if they flote only in the mouth for
a time, and spring not continually from the heart. That gratitude is grateful
and acceptable to God and men, whose root is in the heart, and blossoms in the
tongue, and fruits in the hands; whose root is love, and blossoms praises, and
fruits good works. The root in the heart cannot be seen of any but God, the
blossoms in the lips are blown away with a breath, but the fruits in the
hands are more lasting. Wherefore Noah was not contented after he and his
family were saved from the deluge to offer up a sweet smelling sacrifice of
thankes-giving upon the Altar of his heart; but he leaves behind him an Altar
of stone, Jacob an house to God, Joshua a Trophey, Solomon a Temple, the
Centurion a Synagogue, Veronica a statue of brass, Constantine many Churches
and Hospitals, Paula a magnificent Monastery at Bethlehem, where our Lord was
borne. The Heathen after they had escaped shipwreck hung up their Horat. od.
Me tabula sacer votiva paries indicabit humida suspendisse vestimenta Maris deo.
votivas tabulas to Neptune. After victory, besides supplications per omnia
pulvinaria deorum, they put garlands upon the Images of their gods, and left
the chief spoils taken in war in the Temple of Mars. The Jews by the
commandment of God reserved a golden pot of Manna in the Arc, in memory of
that Manna which fell in the Wilderness. In a thankful acknowledgement of the
deliverance of their first borne in Egypt, they offered every first borne to
God: and to eternize the memorial of their passage out of Egypt, and freedom
from servitude, they altered their Calendar, and made that month in which God
by Moses delivered them out of the house of bondage the Exodus 12.2.
beginning of their months.

Application.
According to which religious presidents our gracious King, being as upon this
day pulled out of the paw first of the Bear, and then of the Lion and his
seven claws, has erected a lasting, living, and which is more, a speaking
monument of his thankfulness to God, by appointing the feast we now keep to
preserve from oblivion his Majesty's wonderful preservation on this day from
imminent destruction. When a motion was made in the Senate of dedicating a
statue of massy gold to the honor of Tacit. annal. l. 2. Illae verae sunt
Statuae quae in hominum mentibus collocantur.
Germanicus, Tiberius the Emperor opposed it, but upon a very plausible
pretense, that Images of brass and gold are subject to many casualties; they
may be stolen away, they may be defaced and battered, foul indignities and
scorns be put upon them. Those are the true Statues of virtue and Altars of
fame which are set up in men's minds: such Altars has our Sovereign erected
in the hearts of all his loving subjects, upon which we offer this day
throughout all his dominions the sacrifice of praise and thankes-giving for his
Majesty's mavelous deliverance, unparalleld in our age. Psalm. 19.2. Dies ad
diem eructat sei monem, and nox ad noctem annunciat scientiam.
One day shall tell another, and one night shall proclaim it to another what
great things the Lord did upon this day for his Anointed, whereat we rejoice.
How was his Majesty wrapped over and over in the snares of death, when under
color of taking a Seminary Priest (as he was made believe) newly arrived with
a pot full of golden seeds to sow rebellion and treason in his Kingdom, he was
led by Alexander Ruthwen through so many chambers into that study which was a
long time before appointed for the stage whereon to act that bloody tragedy,
whose catastrophe was as happy to the King and Kingdom, as dismal and fatal
to the principal Actors. If ever study might be rightly termed according to
the Latin name armarium, this was it; for it was not musaeum, but campus
Martius, not a students treasury, but a traitors armorie: here he finds but
two Authors, and they should both have been Actors. In stead of the gold which
was promised, here he sees Iron and steel, and no strange coin as he was
borne in hand, but his own, I mean the cross daggers, not stamped on metal,
but ready to be driven into his sacred breast, and sheathed in his bowels.
Well might the King here cry upon Philo de legate. Alex. Ubi cessat humanum
auxilium ibi adest divinum.
Philo as Croesus did upon Herod. clio.
Solon when he stood on the pile to be burned, and the fire was kindled at the
bottom: O Philo, Philo, I find thy words to be gospel, though thou were an
unbeleeving Jew. Man's extremest necessity is Gods chiefest opportunity: then
comes help from heaven when the earth is at a stand, and man at his wits
end. What hope was here from man? whence could the King expect any help being
unarmed, unattended, unguarded, between two Traitors (as Christ between two
thieves) with the point of a dagger at his heart, in that dark room? Whence
or how should there break in any light of comfort from any the least chinke?
Where should his hope cast anchor? Upon his servants and train? But besides
many doors, locks, bolts and bars between them and his Majesty, most of
them by the Earl Gowry upon a false alarm were sent out of doors to post
after him in the field. Upon the Traitor himself? But his respectlesse and
barbarous carriage, his desperate speeches, his execrable oaths, his bloody
looks, his sparkling eyes, and glistering poynard drawn threatened nothing put
present death. Upon himself? But alas he had no weapon defensive or offensive,
and now the sign was at the heart, I mean the daggers point at his breast. O
the dread of sacred Majesty! O the bulwark of innocence! O the power of
eloquence! O the force of conscience! which though they could not blunt the
point of the Traito^ dagger, yet they dulled the edge of his malice for a time.
When a scholar of St. Ruffin. in hist.
John the Evangelist, misled by ill company, had turned to a Ruffian, and
common hackster, and robber by the high way, and drew at his master; upon a
word only, spoken to him by St. John, he relents, flings away his weapon, falls
down upon his knees, craveth pardon with tears, and promises for ever to
abandon his wicked course of life. So powerful is the ministry of the word
and mighty in operation, so reverend is the calling of the dispencers of Gods
mysteries, that the naming only of a dead Preacher Mr. Rollock preserved for a
time the life of our Sovereign. Ruthwen cannot endure to hear that the soul
of Master Rollock should accuse him before Christ's tribunal, for defiling the
doctrine of the Gospel which he taught him, by the blood spilt by him of the
Lords Anointed. His heart gives in, and he withdraws himself for a while,
and thereby gives his Majesty time to breathe, and means to cause the study
window to be opened, at which entered some light of comfort. Cic. pro Sylla.
Sed urget eadem fortuna quae caepit; his Majesty must yet bear a worse
brunt. For like as a Toad, being eased of his swelling for a time by eating of
a planten leaf, if he meet with a Spider afterward receives new poison, and
swells more than before: even so Alexander meeting with the Earl Gowry his
brother, (who was the Spider that spun all the web of this treason, which
within a few hours was swept down and himself in it with the besome of
destruction) receives new poison from him, and now is so big with malice and
treason that he is ready to break. In therefore he comes again to the study
with two rapiers, and first binding himself by oath to bereave his Majesty of
his life, he offers to bind his royal hands. But the King putting on the
resolution of the Orator, Cic. in Catil. Si moriendum est in liberate
moriamur.
If we must die let us die as free men, looseneth his hands, and fastening upon
the Traitors hand and sword grappleth with him, and by maine force drew him to
the window (a little before opened) whence by speech and signs he made known
to his faithful servants, at that instant passing under the window, how things
stood with him, and how near he was to utter ruin by treacherous villainy. As
soon as they heard his Majesty's voice they made all possible speed to rescue
their master; yet before they could force the way through so many doors,
locks and bars between them and their immured Sovereign, the light of all
Israel had in all likelihood been extinguished, but that one of the Kings
servants by the secret conduct of divine providence lighted upon the false
door opening to the staire case, which he had no sooner got up, but he sees
the King on the ground, and the Traitor grappling with him, whom after he had
loosened from the King, with many wounds he tumbled down the stairs to
receive his fatal blow from two other of his Majesty's servants, who by this
time had found the blind way leading to the turnepecke. And thus was the first
act of this bloody tragedy ended by the exit or going out of the first Actor
Alexander Ruthwen, first out of that stage, and soon after of this world. The
next act though more bloody yet was by so much the less dreadful, because
the King by his servants, velut Eras. adag.
homerica nube tectus, was saved out of murders way. Now his Majesty's
honorable attendance must prove their valor, and testify their loyalty by
as many mouths as they received wounds in that hot skirmish, wherein their
Antagonists had the advantage of all things save the cause: double they were in
number, better appointed of weapons, and more acquainted with the place. For
the Earl Gowry (like the man possessed in the Gospel, which Luke 11.26.
walked through dry places, and took to him seven spirits worse than himself)
armed himself, and took seven of his servants with him, more hardy and
desperate than himself, and finding his brother newly slain, (...), was so
enraged with fury and revenge, that he swears at his entry into the chamber
that not a man of them should escape, calling them by his Cic. parad. Ex^lem me
suo nomine vocat.
own name Traitors. Here malice and love, fury and courage, treachery and
loyalty, villainy and piety try it out at the point of the sword, and the
combat is soon ended by the death of the Arch-Traitor. Upon whose fall the
hearts of the rest fail, and they are now easily driven out of the room, and
fresh aid comes to the King by the rest of his train, who by this time had
broken down all the doors, and made a passage into the study, where now they
find the King safe, and the Earl Gowry lying dead at his feet. Whereupon they
all fell upon their knees, and praised the mighty God of Jacob, who gives
salvation to Kings, and then had delivered his servant James from the peril of
the sword: then were the words of my text verified, The King shall rejoice in
thy strength, O Lord, exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation. Then, if
ever, our King joyed in thy strength, and in thy salvation excessively
rejoiced. And not long after the words following ( ver. 3.) were fulfilled in
him; Thou preventedst him with blessings of goodness, and thou did set a
Crown of pure gold upon his head, viz. the Crown of England; which shortly
after fell unto him, and has ever since flourished upon his head: and so Lord
may it still till he changes this his corruptible crown with an
incorruptible, and his mortal state with an immortal, purchased for him and
all of us by the death and passion of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To
whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be rendered all glory, honor, praise
and thanksgiving now and for ever. Amen.

PANDORA'S BOX; OR, THE CAUSE OF ALL EVILS AND MISERY. A Sermon preached
before the high Commission in his Graces Chapel at Lambeth. THE SEVENTH
SERMON.
HOS. 13.9. Hesiod. erg. l. 1. (...).
O Israel, thou have destroyed thy self, but in me is thy help.


Most Reverend, Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
I Should tremble to rehearse this text in your ears, if there were not
comfort in it as well as terror, joy as sorrow, help as calamity, salvation
as destruction. But you may easily discern in it a double glass set before
us; in the one we may see our hurt, in the other our help; in the one Israel
fallen, in the other raised up; in the one Adam and all his posterity wounded
by a grievous fall from the Tree of knowledge, and weltring in their own
blood, in the other healed and washed by Christ's blood; in the one destruction
from within, (Thou have destroyed thy self O Israel) in the other salvation
from above; (but in me is thy help.) In the Original (...) it has destroyed
thee, or one has destroyed thee, or thy destruction O Israel, or O Israel thy
utter ruin and desolation. An abrupt and imperfect sentence, to be made up
with something that goes before, or to be gathered from that which follows
after, (...) but or for in me is thy help.

There were never pictures held in greater admiration than those of Plin. l.
35. c. 10.
Timanthes, and they for this especially, that they exhibited more to the
understanding than to the eye, intimating more than was expressed, and
presenting always somewhat to the conceit which could not by colors be
represented to the sight. And for the like reason, those strains of Rhetorike
most take the wise, and affect the judicious ear, which express more by
expressing less, the sentence being broken off in the midst, to show the force
of violent passion which bereaveth us on the sudden both of sense and speech.
The Musicians also in their way tickle the ear by a like grace in music to
that figure in speech by unexpected stops and rests, making a kind of
Aposiopesis and harmonicall Ellipsis. Surely as the broken joints and maimed
limbs of men uncovered much move us to compassion; so the imperfect and maimed
members of sentences, uttered in anger or grief, are aptest both to signify
and to move passion. Such is that broken speech of 2 King. 13.14.
Joash the King concerning Elisha, over whose face he wept and said, O my
father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof. And that of
Psalm. 6.3.
David, My soul is sore troubled, but thou O Lord how long! And the like of
our Luke 19.42.
Savior, If thou have known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
that belong to thy peace. And semblable thereunto is this in my text,
Shikethka, Jisrael perdidit te, or perditio tua, it has undone thee, or thy
ruin O Israel. For those words (ex te) which we find in many latin copies
are added by the Translator to fill up the breach in the sentence: in the
Hebrew there is a verbal Ellipsis or defect, which expresses a real Ellipsis
or utter failing of Isreal's strength, and a figurative Ellipsis and seeming
deficiency in God himself, through a deep taking to heart of Isreal's now most
deplorate estate: Virg Aen. 2.
-- ruit Ilium and ingens
Gloria Dardanidum.


The Crown of Israel is fallen from his head, and all his honor lies in the
dust. Israel after many grievous strokes and wounds received, now bleeds at the
heart, and is a breathing out his last gasp; and the God of Israel by a
Sympathy of grief seems to lie speechless. For his words faulter: thy
destruction Israel, or it has destroyed thee, Israel is destroyed, who has
destroyed Israel? or why is Israel destroyed? why is the cause and author of
Isreal's woe concealed, and the sentence left abrupt and imperfect? Tertul.
adver. Hermog. c. 22. Adoro Scripturae plenitudinem.
Tertullian speaking of the perfection of Scripture says, I adore the fullness
of the Scriptures: in another sense, yet true, I may use the contrary
attribute, and say, I adore the deficiencies and seeming vacuities in Scripture
sentences, where the room left for words is anticipated by passion, and filled
up with sighs and groans. Will you have the cause why God expresses not the
cause of Isreal's plagues? Because he would not add unto them. Had he filled up
the bracke in the contexture of the sentence, it must have bin with these or
the like words, by the consent of Interpreters, It is thy stubborn heart, O
Israel, and thy open rebellion against me: it is thy stoning my Prophets, and
killing my messengers sent early and late unto thee: it is thy spiritual
fornication, and Idolatrous worship of Jeroboams golden calfes that has
heretofore brought all thy misery upon thee, and now has wrought thy final
overthrow. But alas this had been to mingle judgment with wormwood, to kill
them with a word whom he meant to smite with a sword. It is enough for a Judge
to pronounce the dreadful sentence of death, it is too much then to fall foul
upon the prisoner with amplifications and bitter invectives. Howbeit, whether
for these or better reasons best known to himself, God does not here
particularly set down the author or cause of Isreal's woe; yet in the other
member of the sentence (but in me is thy help) removing the cause from
himself, and professing that there had been help in him for them, but for
some bar: he gives them to understand in general what it was he forbear to
speak, but they could not but conceive, and we must gather out this Scripture
for our instruction, that the cause of Isreal's overthrow, and the ruin of all
other Kingdoms is in their sins, and from themselves. As in music, though
each string has a different sound by it self, yet many of them struck
together make but one chord: so the last translation which I follow, and all
the former which I have read, though they much differ in words, yet they accord
in the sense by me now delivered. For whether we read as some do, Rex tuus,
thy King; or as others, Vitulus tuus, thy calfe; or as Calvin, Aliquid praeter
me, something besides me has destroyed thee; or as St. Jerome does, Perditio
tua ex te, thy destruction is from thy self; or as the Kings Translators
render the Hebrew, thou have destroyed thy self, the sentence is all one, thy
mischief is from thy self, but all thy hope of help is from thy God. Julian
gave for his arms in his Scutchion an Eagle struck through the heart with a
flight shaft feathered out of her own wing, with this Motto, propriis
configimur alis, our death flies to us with our own feathers, and our wings
pierce us to the heart. To apply this pattern to my text, and leave the print
thereof upon it to imprint the doctrine thereof deeper in your memories. The
Eagle struck dead is the Church and Commonwealth of Israel, the arrow is the
swift judgment of God, the feathers shed out of her own wings which carried
the arrow so swift, and drove the head of it in so deep are Isreal's sins. It
is a lamentable thing to hear of the ruin and utter overthrow of any
Kingdom; how much more of the downfall of Israel Gods chosen people, his
chief treasure, his only joy? But that Israel should be Isreal's overthrow,
that Israel should be felo de se, and accessarie to his own death and utter
confusion; this must needs prick the quickest vein in our hearts. And these
are the three points which by the assistance of Gods spirit I am first to
clear to your understanding, and after to press upon your religious
affections: 1. The accident to the subject: Destruction. 2. The subject of this
accident: Israel. 3. The cause of this accident in this subject: Thou, or thy
sins; thou by thy sins have destroyed thy self O Israel.


First, of the privative accident, destruction. Destruction is opposed to
construction, as corruption to generation: and as that is the death and
dissolution of all natural bodies, so this of all artificial. I except not
such as are purposely made to preserve corpses from corruption and
putrefaction, as coffins of lead, and sepulchers of Marble. For these also in
time corrupt and moulter away: -- Sunt ipsis quo que fata sepulchris.

Nay, we may make this strong line of the Poet a little stronger, ver. 14.
and say truly, sunt ipsis quo que fatis fata; death it self has his dying
day: for my Prophet in this chapter threatens O death I will be thy plagues O
grave I will be thy destruction.
death with death, and the grave with destruction. Howbeit destruction here, as
it is applied to Israel, seems not so much to signify destruction in the
vulgar acception, that is, the pulling down of the houses, or sacking of
towns and villages, as the dissolution of the state, and downfall of the
Kingdom of Israel: and therefore the point herein to be seriously thought upon
is the Soph Pasuck full point, and fatal period of all earthly States,
Societies, Commonwealths and Kingdoms. All natural things carry in their
style Corruptible, all humane in their style mortal, all earthly in their
style Temporal: to distinguish the first sort from things supernatural, which
are incorruptible; the second sort from things divine, which are immortal; the
third sort from heavenly, which are eternal. The things which are seen, says
the 2. Cor. 4.18.
Apostle, are temporal, but the things which are not seen, are eternal. It
is the royal prerogative of him who Apoc. 19.16. and 17.14.
has written upon his thigh, and on his vesture, King of Kings and Lord of
Lords, that his Kingdom is bounded with no limits, nor confined to time: the
eternity whereof is proclaimed in holy Scriptures by five noble Heralds, two
Kings, two Prophets, and an Archangell. The two Kings are Psalm. 45 6. Thy
throne O God is for ever.
David and Dan. 4.32. Whose dominion is an everlasting dominion.
Nebuchadnezzar. The two Prophets are Cap. 17.14 His kingdom is that which
shall not be destroyed.
Daniel and Micah 4.7. The Lord shall reign from henceforth even for ever.
Micah. The Archangell is Luke 1.31, 32, 33. Horat. car. l. 1. od 3. Semotique
prius tarda necessitas leti corripuit gradum.
Gabriel, whose trumpet sounds most shrill, and gives a most certain sound:
Behold, thou shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall
call his name Jesus, ver. 31. He shall be great, and shall be called the son
of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
David, ver. 32. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of
his Kingdom there shall be no end, ver. 33. Of all other there shall be. For all
politic bodies are in some sort subject to the condition of natural bodies. As
these, so they have their beginning or birth, growth, perfection, state, decay
and dissolution. And as the statures of men in this decrepit and feeble age of
the world are much diminished, and their life shortened; so even States and
Empires fall short of their former greatness, and are like sooner to arrive to
their period, natural end, or to speak more properly, civil death and
dissolution, called in my text destruction. Some who have taken upon them to
calculate as it were the nativitie of the world, and erect a scheme of all the
living, have set the utmost day of the duration of the one, and life of all the
other to fall within four hundred years, according to an ancient tradition of
the Jews fathered upon the house of Melancthon in Chron. l. 1. p. 10. Sex
millia annorum mundus; duo millia inane, duo millia lex, duo millia dies
Messiae: and propter peccata nostra quae multa and magna sunt deerunt anni qui
decrunt.
Elias: The world shall last six thousand years; two thousand thereof there
shall be a vacuitie or emptiness; two thousand the Law shall continue; and the
days of the Messiah shall make out two thousand more; of which if any be
lacking, by reason of our many and grievous sins they shall be lacking. The
Cabalists favor this conceit, and labor to wierdraw it out of the first verse
of the first chapter of Genesis, where because they find six Alephs or A's
which in numerall characters signify so many thousand years, conclude the
duration of the world from the first creation to the end shall make up just
that number of years. And many also of our Christian Chronologists, streining
the letter of 2 Pet. 3.8. One day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a
thousand years as one day.
St. Peter too far, allot precisely six thousand years for the continuance
of the world; at the seventh thousand they believe we shall all begin to keep
our everlasting Sabbath in heaven. For the period of particular Kingdoms
Gasper P^ucer. praesat. in Chron. Carrion. Hanc periodum lege quadam sancitam
divinit^s magnis Impe^iis fatalem esse, and universales mutationes afferre
ostendunt omnium temporum historiae.
Peucerus observes that it seldom or never exceeds 500. years; which he
proves by these instances following. From the departure of the children of
Israel out of Egypt to the building of the first Temple we find much about
five hundred years run out: the first, as also the second Temple stood
thereabouts: the Assyrians ruled in Asia so long: Athens was ruled by Kings,
Rome by Consuls just so many years: From Augustus to Valentinian the last, five
hundred years are reckoned, all which time the seat of the fourth Monarchy of
the world was fixed at Rome. The Church of Rome in a sort continued in her
purity for five hundred years: After the Papacy and superstition grew to the
height in the western parts before the thousanth year, and five hundred
years after the happy reformation begun by Martin Luther. Yet neither that
tradition of the house of Elias, nor the observation of Peucerus are of
infallible certainty. Acts 1.7. which the Father has (...) in his own power.
It belongs not to us to know times and seasons: and though often God has
translated Kingdoms within the limits of five hundred years, yet not always:
some have lasted longer, as the Monarchy of the Assyrians; some far shorter,
as the monarchy of the Persians; and after them of the Grecians. The Christian
Kings of Jerusalem finished their course within a hundred years. Men may
probably guess at the circumvolution of great Empires and Kingdoms: but
neither can the Astrologers certainly foresee by the course of the stars,
nor Bod. de rep. l. 4. c. 2. ex Plat. pol. 8.
Platonicks define by the accomplishment of the nuptial number, nor
Politicians foretell by their intelligence with foreign States, nor Magicians
determine by conference with their familiar spirits: but the Prophets of God
only forewarne by inspiration from him who has decreed before all time the
days of man, and continuance of families, and periods of Kingdoms, and ages
of the world, and lasting of time it self. That which Belshazzar saw, Dan.

a hand writing upon the wall, all Princes and States may see and read in the
records of heaven kept in holy Scripture: Mean, Mean, thou art numbered, thou
art numbered, thy years are summed, thy days are appointed, thine hour is
set. Be thou as great and glorious as Nebuchadnezzars Image with a head of
gold, arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, and legs of Iron; yet thou
stand upon feet of clay. And what is now become of the head of gold which
represented the Assyrian? and arms of silver which resembled the Persian? and
the thighs of brass which set forth the Grecian? and the legs of iron which
signified the Roman Monarchy? Are they not all broken together, and become like
chafe of a summers flower dispersed with the wind? How proudly does
Sennacherib insult over those Nations whom his Ancestors had destroyed? Esaias

Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arphad, and the King of the City

of the great King of Ashur: Where is the King of Shinar, and the King of

Monarch of Assyria? Whereas he should with Nebuchadnezzar have Dan. 4.34.35.
honored for these victories him that lives for ever, whose Kingdom is from
generation to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as
nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among
the Inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What
do thou?

Horat. l. 1. car. od. 34.
Valet ima summis mutare: and
insignem attenuat Deus, hinc apicem
rapax fortuna sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet.
If the state of Kingdoms and Monarchies is so fickle, what folly, or rather
madness is it for any private man to dream of perpetuities and certainties,
and indefeisable estates? As if a man might be safe in a small cabbine under
hatches, when the whole Ship is drowned under the water: or a Spider secure in
his web, when the whole window is pulled down: or a young bird out of danger
in the nest, when the whole arm of the tree is torn off. All private men's
estates are ventered in the bottom of the Commonwealth, and all
Commonwealths in the great vessel of the earth, which was once swallowed up
with a deluge of Water, and shall be ere it be long with a deluge of fire. A
house infected with some kind of Leprosy by the Law was to be pulled down
and burnt to ashes: and when iniquity shall so abound on the earth that the
whole world shall be infected with the Leprosy of monstrous and enormous sins,
this great house which has been long tottered, shall be burned, and fall
down about our ears. And verily if all other signs be accomplished, as many
of the learned in their commentaries upon the Apocalypse contend, I should
think the world cannot long stand: for Juvenal. sat. 1. Quando ub^rior
vitiorum copia? quando Major avaritia patuit sinus, etc Horat. l. 1. car. od.
35. Eheu cicatricu^ and sceleris pudet, fratrumque quid nos dura refugimus
caetas? quid intactum nefasti liquimus?
Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit. Every sin is grown to the height. Atheism
to the height, even in men of high calling: profaneness to the height, even
on the Lords Sabbaths, and in his holy Temple: Impuritie and immodestie at the
height, even daring the consistory: Iniquity at the height, possessing the
place and seat of justice: Drunkenness at the height, reeling at noonday:
Idolatry, Heresy, and Superstition at the height, advancing their followers
to the highest preferments in the Church, and keeping under pure Religion, and
the sincere Professors thereof.

It will be said, though plagues fall upon all Egypt, yet Goshen shall be free,
though the whole world be destroyed, all Israel shall be saved. Israel is Gods
firstborn, who shall dis-inherit him? Israel is the Vine which the right hand
of God has planted, who shall root it up? Israel is the Signet on his finger,
who shall pluck it off? Nay, Israel is the apple of his eye, who shall pull it
out? Let heaven and earth pass away, yet Gods covenant with Israel shall stand
fast; his seed shall endure for ever, and his throne shall be as the Sun
before God. If these promises stand good unto Israel, this Prophecy of Isreal's
downfall must needs fall to the ground. For how can the Kingdom of Jacob, and
the captivity of Jacob, Isreal's gathering out of all Nations, and Isreal's
scattering abroad into all Nations, Isreal's perpetual standing, and Isreal's
falling and utter subversion stand together?

To compose this seeming difference between Gods promises to Israel, and his
threats against Israel, we must distinguish of diverse kinds of promises made
to Israel, and of diverse Isreal's to which the promises may appertain. Israel
sometime signifies 1. Properly 1. Either the whole posterity of Jacob: 2. Or
the ten tribes which were rent from Roboam.
2. Figuratively The spiritual kingdom of Christ over the Elect.



Again, there is a threefold Israel: 1. According to the flesh only, of which
the Romans 9.6. Romans 11.25.
Apostle speaks expressly; They are not all Israel which are of Israel. And
obstinacy is come to Israel. 1 Cor. 10.18.
Behold Israel after the flesh. 2. Israel according to the Spirit only. Heb.
8.10.
This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those
days, I will put my Law into their minds, and write them in their hearts,
etc. and so all Romans 11.26.
Israel shall be saved, for this is my covenant with them when I take away their
sins. 3. Israel according to the flesh and spirit; which may rightly be
called the Israel of Israel, as Demosthenes terms Athens (...), the Greece of
Greece: to Israel in this third sense Christ had a special commission: I am
not sent, says he, but to the lost Math. 10.6. G^^ to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.
sheep of the house of Israel. Saint Paul points to this Israel, when the
fullness of the Gentiles is come in, all Romans 10.26.
Israel shall be saved. And Saint John, Apoc. 7 4.
There were sealed an hundredth and forty and four thousand of all the Tribes
of the children of Israel.


Retain these distinctions of Israel, and put a difference between the
promises; whereof

Some are 1. Absolute, 2. Conditional.
Some are 1. Temporal, 2. Spiritual:
and you shall easily reconcile those texts of Scriptures which seem to
overthrow this prophecy concerning the utter overthrow of the Kingdom of
Israel, (by which we are here to understand the ten Tribes) which fell out not
long after this Prophecy, in the days of Hosea their last King.

As for Judah, the Genesis 49.10.
Scepter, according to Jacobs prophecy, departed not from it until Shilo came:
but after he came and was rejected of that Nation, and the sacred twig of Jesse
was nailed to an accursed tree, God cut it off root and branch by the Romans.
Within less than half an age after our Lords death, Jerusalem bewailed it
with bloody tears, and the Temple rued it: in the ruins, dust, and ashes
whereof we may read this motto: There is no place privileged from Gods
judgment: no Sanctuary for presumptuous sinners: no protection from arrests
taken out of the Court of Heaven. The Palladium saved not Troy from the
Greeks, nor the Arc the Israelites from the Philistims, nor the Temple the
Jews from the Romans, nor the tombs of Martyrs Rome from the Goths, nor the
Crucifix the Christians in Palestine from Saladine the Sultan of Egypt. God
most hates sin in them whom he loves most, and most severely punishes it
in them; as Moses, Job, David, and Saint Paul felt by their own smart. When
the Jews in Jeremie cried out, Jer. 7.4.
The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,
presuming that God would save them for the Temples sake; the Prophet might have
answered, Which you have defiled, which you have polluted, which you have
profaned. The cry of our sins will soon move the justice of heaven (if we
stop it not) to turn the mouth of this roaring Cannon toward us. We are, we
trust in the God of Israel, the Israel of God: and if we take not their
destruction to heart, it will prove ours. For we cannot but thus reason with
our selves: If God spared not the natural branches for their unfruitfulnesse,
will he spare the engraffed? If judgment begins at the house of God, where
is it like to end? If God has sent a bill of divorce to the beloved City, and
has quite forsaken his first love, may his latter Spouse the Church of the
Gentiles presume to escape better, if she prove alike disloyal? If it has
been thus done, as before is specified, to the green tree, what shall be
done to the dry? If Jerusalem be made an example, and the Temple a lamentable
spectacle of divine justice, can Babylon and the house of Rimmon stand long? If
the seven golden Candlestickes placed by Christ's own hand in Asia, and
furnished with burning and shining lamps, are removed, and their lights put
out, have not we cause to fear that our Candlestickes shall be removed if we
love darkness more than light? Did God not spare his own House, but suffered
it to be burnt to Ashes for the sins committed in it? will he, think ye,
spare our houses if such wickedness be found in them for which he destroyed
the Holy of Holies?

But I list not to dwell any longer upon the ruins of Israel: I hasten to the
cause of Isreal's woe. Which as it concerned the Israelites more nearely, so it
will come also more home to us; Thou have destroyed thy self: Tu, Te. Praise
God O Israel for thy former prosperity, but now thank thy self for thy
imminent desolation. Clem. Alexand. strom. l. 1. (...).
Clemens Alexandrinus observes acutely that although Theology, flowing from
the fountain of sacred Scripture, run all in one channel; yet that many
other rivers arising from diverse heads and sources fall into it: as for
example, in the proper doctrine of this text, that destruction is from our
selves, but salvation from God, Moral Philosophy entervaineth with Divinity
in that her assertion; Plat. apol. Socr. Anytus and Miletus occidere me
possun^, laedere non possunt.
Nemo laeditur nisi a seipso, no man is hurt but by himself. Polity in that
observation, Lucan de bello Pharsal. l. 1.
In se magna ruunt, Great States as buildings are oppressed with their own
weight, and fall upon themselves. Art military in that stratagem intus Equus
Trojanus, that Trojane horse is within the walls which ruins the City. The
sword of the enemy draws out but a little corrupt blood, that may be well
spared: it is sedition and intestine war that gives the State her deaths
wound.

Eagle starved by his ravenous feeding, which makes his bill grow so big that

brings in evidence of fact to confirm the truth of this observation in humane
affairs. Sodom might have stood for all the five Kings that bid her battle,
if the unnatural fire of lust had not drawn down upon her unnatural fire, I
mean the fire of hell, as Salvi^n. de gubern. Dei. l. 1. Deus voluit declarar^
udicium q^ando super impium populum Gehennam misit de coelo.
Salvian speaks, from heaven. Troy might have stood a thousand years for all
the Grecian Fleet of a thousand ships, if Antenor had not by treachery opened
the Scean gate, and the Inhabitants upon the unexpected remove of the Fleet
thrown their houses out at the windows; whereof the Greeks having
intelligence Virg. Aen 2.
Invadunt Urbem somno vinoque sepultam: surprise the City, partly in a dead
sleep, partly dead drunk. It was not Dan's vigilancie, but Judge. 18.27. And
they came unto Laish, unto a people that were quiet and secure and they smote
them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the City with fire.
Laish her security that exposed her to spoil. It was not Xen Cyr. poed.
Cyrus his valor and prowess, but Babylons effeminatenesse and luxury that
subdued it: the Citizens kept a feast, and their King Belshazzar was quaffing
in the bowls of the Sanctuary, when the Persians stole in upon them and slew
them like beasts. They were not Fabius his soldiers, but Capua's pleasures
which conquered Capua Hannibali Cannae.
Hannibal. It was not Titus his siege without, but the Zelots sedition within
the walls that dispeopled Jerusalem, strowing her streets with carcasses, and
dying her common Seurs with blood. It was not the Turks puissance, but the
covetousness of the Citizens of Constantinople which made it a prey to the
enemy, as the Turk himself confessed, when in the sacking of the City, and
rifling the houses, he found such a mass of treasure as might have easily
secured the place if the owners would have contributed but a small part of it
to the maintenance of the Greek Emperors war against the Saracens. And to
come nearer my text, it was not the Assyrians horse and chariots, but Jeroboams
golden calves, together with their sorcerie, witchcraft, and other sins
discovered unto them by the Prophets Amos and Hosea, but unrepented of, which
destroyed Israel. It is true which Arnobius affirms, that we Arnob. adver.
gent. l. 2. Procul absit tam scelerata persuasio, ut rerum omnium salus Deus
ulli rei fuerit miseriarum aut discriminum causa.
may by no means stain the decrees of God with any aspersion of bloody
cruelty, or impute to him the miseries which befall us: and yet God by his
Prophet Amos 3.6.
Amos demands, Shall there be any evil in a City, and the Lord has not
done it? Salv. de providentia l. 8. A Deo quippe punimur, sed ipsi facimus ut
puniamur, cum autem punire nos ipsi facimus, cui dubitum est, quin ipsi nos
nostris criminibus puniamus, vim Deo faciamus iniquitatibus nostris, and ipsi
in nos iram Dei armamus.
Salvianus excellently accords the seeming difference between these
assertions; God is the cause, and we are the cause of our woe; God punishes
us, and we punish our selves: God indeed punishes us, but we cause, and
after a sort force him to do it: God inflicteth stripes, but we deserve them:
God strikes, but we provoke: God powers out the vials of his wrath, but we
fill them up to the brimme by our overflowing iniquities. God makes us good
if we are so: but in a true sense we make him just, (and which may seem a
great Paradoxe) even by our injustice. For if we were not unjust in
transgressing, God could not be just in punishing; neither would he desire
any way to exalt his glory by the ruin of his creature. For he delights in
mercy, ( Micah 7.18.) and goodness is his nature. He therefore never sends
evil upon us before we have it in us, he never fills us a cup of Psalm. 75.8.
In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full of
mixture, and he powers out of the same.
red wine before the measure of our crimson sin is full; neither powers he
out the dregs of his wrath upon any, but such as Moab-like are settled upon
their lees, Zeph. 1.12.

To strike sail then, and land my discourse: If our Israel, if the Scepter of
our Moses, and the Rod of our Aarons flourish not as in former times, if the
people be multiplied, and yet our joy not increased, if our corn, and wine,
and oil abound, and yet we are not enriched, if the public weal and every
man's private, by some secret vein inwardly bleeding, has been in a kind of
consumption, if our State has received any wound, or our Church any blow, we
know where to lay the blame: we must say with mournful Jerusalem, Lam. 1.8.
The Lord is righteous, but we have rebelled against him: God has been good
to us, but we have rewarded evil unto our selves: God has not forgotten to
be gracious, but we to be thankful: God would be better to us if we were
better: Hor. car. l. 1. od. 3.
Sed nos per nostrum non patimur scelus
Iracunda Deum ponere fulmina.


Does any desire to know how it comes to pass that our gold is not so pure?
our silver so bright? our brass and iron so strong as heretofore? that is, the
honor of our Nobility, the riches of our Gentry, the virtue and strength of
our Commonalty is much empaired. If I and all Preachers should be silent, our
Sen. de ira l. 2. Nec furtiva jam scelera sunt, praeter oculos eunt, and in

loud sins would proclaim it, blasphemy would speak it, profaneness
swear it, pride and vanity paint and print it, usury and bribery tell it,
luxury vent it, gluttony and drunkenness belch it out. St. Peter's argument
were now of no force, these men are not drunk, seeing that it is but the third
hour of the day: for all hours of day, yea and night too, are alike to many
of our drunkards. Tacit. annal. l. 3. Praestat omittere prae valida and adulta
vitia, quam id assequi ut palam fiat quibus vitiis impares simus.
Tiberius his advice in Tacitus may pass in point of policy for good, viz. to
dissemble and conceal overgrowne and headstrong evils, rather than by taxing
them to make it known what vices have so got the masterie of us, that we
cannot stand against them: but religion allows of no such politic silence.
God lays this burden upon his Prophets, to burden all sorts of men with all
sorts of sin, and to tell the greatest Potentates upon the earth, that
Potentespotenter, that the mighty shall be mightily tormented; that the Apoc.
19.18.
fowls that fly in the midst of heaven shall eat the flesh of Kings, and the
flesh of Captains, and the flesh of mighty men. The louder our sins cry, the
higher we must lift up our voice like a trumpet to cry them down, even by
thundering Gods judgments against them.

Pope Plat. in vita Silv.
Silvester when he was bid beware of Jerusalem, for that whenever he should
come thither, he should certainly dye, he flattered himself that he should
put off his death long enough, because he was sure that he never meant to
travel into Palestine, little thinking that there was a Church at Rome of that
name, into which he had no sooner set his foot, but he met with his evil
Genius, as Brutus did at Philippi, and suddenly ended his wretched days.
Suffer I beseech you the word of admonition and exhortation: It is not Rome in
Italy which we need so much to fear, though it be the Seminary of Heretics
and Traitors; but Rome in England, Rome at home; I mean the Popish faction
among us, which casts continually fireballs of dissension in the State, and
of Schism in the Church, to set all in a combustion. Cant. 2.15.
O take away the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the grapes of that far
spreading vine which God has planted among us by his word, and watered by the
blood of so many noble Martyrs.

But I fear to lance any public sores any deeper: let me give but a prick
at our private wheales, and then I will soon rid you and my self of pain.
Beloved, we are all querulous, yet none almost either knows or looks after
the cause of their woe. One complains that he goes backward in the world,
and sinketh in his estate, and he lays all the blame either upon bad
servants, or theevish neighbors, or racking Landlords, or hard times, or some
losses by sea or land; but never looks into his own heart, where the true
cause lies, be it covetousness, or distrust of Gods providence, or a
quarrelling disposition, or pride, or idleness, or luxury, or sacrilege.
Another is still whining that he cannot get or keep his health, and he
imputes this either to his crazie constitution by nature, or ill air, or over
much labor and study; whereas indeed the cause is his ill diet, his sitting up
all night at Revels, his pouring in strong wines, and spending the greatest
part of the day in Tavernes, his intemperancy or incontinency. All other sins
are without the body, but he that 1 Cor. 6.18.
commits fornication sins against his own body. First, against the
honor of his body; for thereby he makes the members of Christ the members of
an harlot: next, the strength, health, and life of the body, which nothing more
enfeebleth, empaireth, and endangereth, than greedily drinking stolen waters,
and coveting after strange flesh. A third is troubled in mind, and he feels
no comfort in his conscience, the good spirit has left him, and the evil
spirit haunteth him, and scorcheth his soul with the flashes of Hell fire; and
he ascribes this to some melancholy blood, or worldly discontent, or the
indiscretion of some Boanerges, sons of thunder, who preach nothing but
damnation to their hearers; whereas the true cause is in himself; he grieveth
the spirit of grace, he turns it into wantonness, and quenches the light
of it in himself; and therefore God withdraws this holy Comforter from him
for a time. When Just. hist. l. 1. Zopyrus qui sibi labia and nares praecidi
curasset, queritur crudelitatem Regis.
Zopyrus had cut his own lips and nose, he gave it out that the Babylonians
had so barbarously used him: such is the condition of most men; they disfigure
their souls, dismember their bodies by monstrous sins, and yet lay the whole
blame upon others. Mat. 10.36.

enflamed with anger, that streining himself to utter his passion, he brake a

felt their daggers at his heart whom he had saved from the sword; Mean servare
ut sint qui me perdant! O that I should save men to do me such a mischief! O
that we should harbor those snakes in our bosoms, which, if we long keep
them there, will sting us to death! A strange thing it is, and much to be
lamented, that the soul should prescribe remedies against the maladies of the
body, and yet procure nourishment for her own diseases. What are the vicious
affections we feed and cherish within us, but so many pernicious infections of
the mind? What is anger, but a fit of a frenzy? fear, but a sh^king fever?
ambition, but a wind collicke? malice, but an apostem? faction, but a
convulsion? envy, but a consumption? security, but a dead palsy? lust, but an
impure itch? immoderate joy, but a pleasing trance of the soul? These are the
greatest causes of our woe, not only because they disturb the peace of our
conscience, and set us upon scandalous and dangerous actions; but also because
they draw upon us heavy and manifold judgments. From which if we desire to be
freed, that they prove not our utter destruction, let us

First, confess our sins with David to be the fuel of Gods wrath, and the
fountain of all our miseries: Psalm. 51.4.
Against thee, thee only have we sinned, and done this, and that, and the
third, and many more evils in thy sight, that thou might be justified when
thou speak, and clear when thou art judged: and with Salv. l. 4. de provid.
Sive mise^ae nostrae sint. sive infirmitates, sive eversiones etc. testimoni^
sunt mali servi and boni domini: quomodo mali servi? quia patimur ex part quod
meremur: quomodo boni domini? quia ostendit quid mereamur, sed non irrogat quae
meremur.
Salvianus, Whatsoever our miseries are, or afflictions, or persecutions, or
overthrowes, or losses, or diseases, they are testimonies of an evil servant
and a good master. How of an evil servant? Because in them we suffer in part
what we deserve. How testimonies of a good master? Because by them he shows
us what we deserve, and yet lays not upon us so much as we deserve.

Secondly, let us compose our selves to endure that with patience which we have
brought upon our selves: Tute in hoc tristi tibi omne exedendum est.

Thirdly, let us forsake our beloved sins, and then God will take away his
plagues from us: let us be better our selves, and all things shall go better
with us: let repentance be our practice, and a speedy reformation our
instruction, so Gods judgments shall not be our destruction.

Now O Father of mercy and tender compassion in the bowels of Jesus Christ, who
have showed us what we deserve by our sins, and yet have not rewarded us
according to our iniquities, take away our stony hearts from us, and give us
hearts of flesh, that thy threats may make a deep impression in us, and that
we may speedily remove the evil of our sins out of thy sight, that thou
may remove the evil of punishment from us: so our sin shall not be our
destruction, but thy mercy our salvation through Jesus Christ. To whom, etc.

THE CHARACTERS OF HEAVENLY WISDOM. A Sermon preached before his Grace, and
diverse other Lords and Judges spiritual and temporal, in Lambeth. THE EIGHTH
SERMON.
PSALM. 2.10. Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings: be instructed ye Judges of
the earth.


Most Reverend, Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
THe mirror of humane eloquence apologizing for his undertaking the defense of
Murena against Cato the elder pertinently demands Cic. pro Muren. A quo
tandem Marce Cato aequius est defendi Consulem quam a Consule?
who so fit a patron of a Consul as a consul himself? The like may be said
in the justification of King David's lesson read in my text to Princes and
Judges; a quo tandem aequius est doceri Reges quam a Rege? erudiri Judices quam
a Judice? Who so proper to tutour Kings as a King? who might better give Judges
their charge than the chief Judge and Sovereign Justice in his Kingdom? Not
only nature and blood, but arts also and professions make a kind of
brotherhood: and an admonition that comes from a man in place to another in
like place and office, (that is, spoken by authority to authority) carries a
double authority, and cannot but be entertained with due respect and careful
regard. Therefore God in his wisdom instructed the Prophet David by 2. Sam.
7.3.5.
Nathan a Prophet, reproved the Apostle Saint Gal. 2.14.
Peter by Paul an Apostle, informed John the Apoc. 7.14.
Elder by an Elder, and here advises Kings by a King. Be wise now therefore, O
ye Kings: be learned ye Judges of the earth.

In this verse we have 1. A lesson applied, Of wisdom to Kings. Of
instruction to Judges.
2. A reason implied in the words of the earth; that is, Either Kings and
Judges made of earth, Or made Kings and Judges of earth.



Kings and Judges are but men of earth, earthly and therefore in subjection to
the God of heaven: and they are made Kings and Judges only of the earth, that
is, earthly and humane affairs, and therefore in subordination to divine and
heavenly Laws. For the order, first King David commends wisdom to Kings,
and then instruction or learning, viz. in the Laws, to Judges. Kings are above
Judges, and wisdom, the glory of a Prince, above learning, the honor of a
Judge. Kings make Judges, and wisdom makes learned: as the power of Kings is
the source of the authority of Judges, so wisdom is the fountain of all
laws, and consequently of all instruction and learning in them. First
therefore be wise O ye Kings to make good Laws, and then be learned O ye
Judges in these Laws, and found Ye your wisdom, Ye your learning in
humility:
for it is earth not only upon which your consistory stands, but also of which
you your selves consist. As the tongue is moved partly by a muscle in it self,
partly by an artery from the heart: so besides the motive to these virtues in
this verse it self, there is a reason drawn by the spirit to enforce these
duties from the heart of this Psalm, ver. 6. which is like an artery conveying
spirit and life to this admonition here: Yet have I set my King, etc. as if the
Prophet had said, Behold, O Kings, a throne above yours set in the stars:
behold, O Judges of the earth, a tribunal or judgment seat above yours
established in the clouds. There is a King of heaven by whom all earthly Kings
reign, and a Judge of quick and dead to whom all Judges of the earth are
accountable.

Horat. od. car. l. 3. od. 1.
Regum timendorum in proprios greges,
Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis.
Kings are dreadful to their subjects, God to Kings: Judges call other men to
the bar, but Christ Jesus shall summon all Judges one day to his tribunal,
Cyp. de mortal.
justissime judicaturus a quibus est injustissime judicatus, most justly to
judge Judges by whom both in himself and in his members he has been most
unjustly judged.

O Kings. The more excellent the office the more eminent the quality ought to
be: no virtue so befits a Prince as religious wisdom, the Queen of all
virtues: be wise therefore O ye Kings, excel in the grace which excels all
others: crown your royal dignity with all Princely virtues, and chain them
all together in prudence with the linkes following. Serve the Lord with fear,
fear him with joy, rejoice in him with love, and love him with confidence.
First, serve him not carelessly, but sollicitously, fearing to displease him.
Secondly, fear him, not servilely, but filially, with joy. Thirdly, rejoice in
him, not presumptuously, but awfully, with trembling. Fourthly, Tremble before
him, not desperately, but hopefully; so fear him in his judgments, that ye
embrace him in his mercies, and kiss him in the face of Jesus Christ. Though
he frown on you in his anger, yet still seek to please him: yea, though he
smite you in his wrath, and kill you all the day long, yet put your trust in
him and you shall be happy.

Be wise. Wisdom is the minds Arist. Eth. (...)
eye, by which she pryeth into all the secrets of nature, and mysteries of
State, and discerns between good and evil, and prudently guides all the
affairs of life, as the helm does a ship. No good can be done without her
direction, nor evil be avoided but by her forecast. She is the chief of the
four cardinal virtues, and may rightly be styled Cardinalium cardo, the hinge
that turns them all about. They advance not till she strikes an alarm, nor
retire till she sound a retreat. What the Apostle speaks of the three heavenly
graces, now there 1 Cor. 13.13.
remain these three, faith, hope, and charity, but the greatest of these is
charity; may be in like manner affirmed concerning the pre-eminence of
wisdom in respect of the other cardinal virtues, now there remain these
four: 1. Wisdom to direct, 2. Justice to correct, 3. Temperance to abstain,
4. Fortitude to sustain;
but the greatest of these is wisdom. For wisdom informs justice,
moderateth temperance, and leads fortitude. Wisdom gives rules to justice,
sets bounds to temperance, puts reins on fortitude. Without wisdom
justice hurts others, temperance our selves, Horat. od. car. l.
fortitude both our selves and others.

Isoc. ad Demon. (...).
Vis consili expers mole ruit sua. Saint Bernard. ser. 85. in cant. Sapientia a
sapore dicta est quia virtuti velut condimentum accedens sapidam reddit.
Bernard deriveth sapientia a sapore, sapience from sapour, because wisdom
gives a good relish to virtue. Discretion is the salt of all our actions,
without which nothing that is done or spoken is savourie. What does pregnancie
of wit, or maturitie of judgment, or felicity of memory, or variety of
reading, or multiplicitie of observation, or gracefulness of deliverie steed a
man that wants wisdom and discretion to use them? In these respects and
many more Solomon the wisest King that ever wore corruptible Crown, in his
prayer to God prefers wisdom to all other gifts whatsoever. And indeed so
admirable a virtue, so rare a perfection, so inestimable a treasure it is, that
the heathen who had but a glimpse of it, discover it to be a beam of that
light which no man can approach unto, Cic. Tus. quaest.
haec est una hominis sapientia, non arbitrarite scire quod nescias: this is
the chiefest point of man's wisdom, says Tully out of Socrates his mouth, to
have no opinion of his wisdom, but to know that undoubtedly he knows
nothing, at least as he ought to know. Justinian, though a great Emperor,
could not avoid the censure of folly for calling his wife by the name of
Sapientia; because, says Saint Austin, nomen illud augustius est quam ut
homini conveniat: because the name of wise, and much more of wisdom in the
abstract, is too high a title for any on earth to bear. What greater folly
then can be imagined in any man or woman to assume wisdom to themselves,
whose greatest wisdom consists in the humble acknowledgement of their
follies and manifold oversights? Therefore Lactantius wittily comes over the
seven wise masters, as they are called, whom antiquity no less observed than
Seamen do the seven Stars about the North Pole. When, says he, Lact. ^. 4.
divin. instit^. 1. Sicaeter^ omnes praeter ipsos stulti fuer^nt, ne illi quidem

there were but seven wise men in all the world, I would feign know in whose
judgment they were held so, in their own or the judgment of others; if in
the judgment of others, then of fools, by their own supposition empaling all
wisdom within the breasts of those seven: if in their own judgment they
were esteemed the only wise of that age, then must they needs be fools; for
no such fool as he who is wise in his own conceit. This consideration induced
Socrates to pull down his crest, and renounce the name of a wise man, and
exchange Sophon into Philosophon, the name of Sophister into Philosopher, of
wise into a lover of wisdom, with which title all that succeeded him in his
School of wisdom contented themselves. When the Sphinx Philosoph. c. 7.
Gryphus.
Milesian Fishermen drew up in their net a massy piece of gold in the form of
a Table or planke, there grew a great strife and contention in Law whose that
draught should be, whether the Fishermens who rented the fishing in that river,
or the Lords of the soil and water. In the end, fearing on all hands lest this
Altar of gold should melt away in law charges, they defer the judgment of
this controversy to Apollo, who by his Oracle answered, that it neither
appertained to the Fishermen, nor to the Lord of the Manor, but ought to be
delivered as a present to the wisest man then living. Whereupon this golden
Table was first tendered to Thales the Milesian, who sends it to Bias, Bias
to Solon, Solon in the end to Apollo, whom the heathen adored as the God of
wisdom. By this shoving of the Table from wise man to wise man, and in the end
fixing it in the Temple of Apollo, they all in effect subscribed to the
judgment of him who thus concludes his Epistle, To Rom 16.27. 1 Timothy 1.17. To
the King immortal, invisible, the only wise God be honor and glory for ever
and ever.
God only wise be glory for ever. And questionless, if we speak of perfect
and absolute wisdom, it must be adored in heaven, not sought for on the
earth. He alone knows all things, who made all things: he comprehends
them in his science, who contains them in his essence. Yet ought we to seek
for the wisdom here meant as for treasure: and although we may not hope in
this life to be wise unto perfection, yet may we and ought we to know the holy
Scriptures which are able to make us 2 Timothy 3.15.
wise unto salvation. In these we find a fourefold wisdom mentioned: 1.
Godly, 1. Godly wisdom is piety: 2. Worldly, 2. Worldly wisdom is policy:
3. Fleshly, 3. Fleshly wisdom is sensuality: 4. Divelish. 4. Divelish
wisdom is mischievous subtlety.

1. Godly wisdom is here meant, as the words following make it evident, Serve
the Lord with fear; and reason makes it yet more evident. For the Prophet
needed not to exhort Princes to worldly wisdom, the point of Policy is too
well studied by them: nor to fleshly wisdom, for they mostly take but too much
care to fulfill their lusts, and maintain their Port, and provide for their
temporal peace and safety. As for divellish wisdom, which makes men wise to
do Jer. 4.22.
evil, so holy a Prophet as David was would not so much as have taken it in
his lips, unless peradventure to brand it with the note of perpetual infamy.
The wisdom therefore which he here commends to Kings is a godly, a holy,
and a heavenly wisdom. A wisdom which begins in the fear of God, and
ends in the salvation of man. A wisdom that rebukes the wisdom of the
flesh, and despises the wisdom of the world, and confounds the wisdom of
the Devil. A wisdom that advertiseth us of a life after this life, and a
death after this death, and shows us the means to attain the one, and avoid
the other. Moral or civil wisdom is as the eye of the soul, but this
wisdom the Spirit here prefers to Kings, is the eye of the spirit. Ubi
desinit Philosophus ibi incipit Medicus, where the Philosopher ends there the
spiritual Physician begins. The highest step of humane wisdom is but the
lowest and first of divine. As Moses his face shined after he communed with
God, so all moral and intellectual virtues, after we have communion with
Christ, and he comes near to us by his spirit, receive a new luster from
supernatural grace. Prudence or civil wisdom is in the soul as a precious
diamond in a ring; but spiritual wisdom is like Solis jubar, the Suns
rays falling upon this Diamond, wonderfully beautifying and illustrating it.
Of this heavenly light, at this time by the eye salve of the Spirit clearing
our sight, we will display five beams.

1. The first, to begin with our end, and to provide for our eternal estate
after this life in the first place. For here we stay but a while, and be our
condition what it will be, it may be altered: there we must abide by it,
without any hope of change. Here we slide over the Sea of glass mentioned in
the Apoc. 15.2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass.
Apocalypse, but there we stand immovable in our stations: here we are like
wandering stars erraticke in our motions, there we are fixed for ever, either
as stars in heaven to shine in glory, or as brandirons in hell to glowe in
flames. Therefore undoubtedly the unum necessarium, the one thing above all
things to be thought upon is, what shall become of us after we go hence, and
be no more seen. The heathen saw the light of this truth at a chincke as it
were, who being demanded why they built for themselves glorious sepulchers, but
low and base houses, answered, because in the one they sojourned but for a
short space, in the other they dwelt. To this Solomon had an eye when he
terms the grave man's Eccles. 12.5. Man goes to his long home, and the
mo^rners go about the streets.
long home; and a greater than Solomon, when he informs his Disciples that in
his Joh 14.2.
Fathers house there are many mansions, that is, standing or abiding places.
Such are many in heaven built upon precious stones, but none on earth: here we
have only stands for an hour, or boothes for a Fair, or bowers for a dance,
or at the most Innes for a bait. Eccles. 3.2.
There is a time, says the wise man, to be borne, and a time to die: what,
and no time betwixt? sometimes none at all, as in those that are still-borne:
if it be any, as sometimes it is, he makes no reckoning of it, but joins death
immediately to our birth, as if they were contiguous, and our cradles stood in
our grave. The space between our birth and death, be it extended to the
longest period, is but a moment in respect of eternity, and yet ex hoc momento
pendet aeternitas, upon the well or ill employing of this moment depends our
eternity. I will tell you a strange thing says Sen ep. ad Lucil.
Seneca, Many die before they begin to live. I can tell you a stranger thing,
many die before ever they think of the true life. These, howsoever they may
carry the name of wise and great Statesmen, yet when it will be too late they
shall see their folly far to exceed that of the simplest Idiot in the world:
when at the hour of their death finding that they have laid out their whole
stock of wealth and wit in purchasing and furnishing a chamber in a thorough
fare, and provided themselves no house in the City, where they are for ever to
abide, shall cry out in the bitterness of their soul, either with Carrion. in
Cron.
Severus, Omnia fui, and nihil profui; I have been all things, and yet have
done no good at all: or with Adrian, Sphinx Philos.
O animula vagula blandula
hospes comesque corporis,
quae nunc abibis in loca! etc.
O my pretty soul, the pleasant guest and companion of my body, into what
places shall thou now go, naked, cold, and trembling! or with the afflicters
of the righteous; Wisd. 5.8, 9, 10.13.
What has pride profited us? or what good has riches with our vaunting
brought us? All these things are passed away like a shadow, and like a post
that hastes by. And as a Ship that passes over the waves of the water, which
when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of
the keele in the waves: Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were borne,
began to draw to our end, and had no sign of virtue to show, but were consumed
in our own wickedness. I like well of his resolution who said, (...), I hate
that wise man, whose wisdom reflects not upon himself, who is no whit
bettered by his wisdom. He cannot be wise who is not provident: he is not
provident who prepares not a place for his soul after she is dislodged of the
body. He is no thriftie man who lavisheth out his time, and spends his
strength in pursuing shadows, when with less pain and cost he might have
purchased a substantial and indefeisable estate: he is no good husband who
takes perpetual care for his temporal affairs, and takes little or none at
any time for his spiritual and eternal; who gathers treasure upon earth,
where rust and Matthew. 7.19.
moth does corrupt, and thieves break thorough and steal; and laye^^ up no
treasure in heaven, where neither rust nor moth does corrupt, and thieves do
not break thorough and steal: who drives a great and rich trade in foreign
parts, and returns no money by letters of exchange, sent by the hands of the
poor, to be repaid him upon his return into his country in heaven: who travels
sea and land to dig into the bowels of the earth, yea and sometimes rakes hell
also for unrighteous Luke 16.9.
Mammon, and when he has great store of it, makes no friends with it, that
when he fails they may receive him into everlasting habitations.

2. The second precept is to inform our selves certainly how we stand in the
Court of heaven, whether recti in curia or no: to know by the reflection of
grace in our souls, whether Gods countenance shine upon us, or there be a
cloud between it and us. For as the Plin. not. hist. l. 9. c. 35. Coeli iis
major societas est quam maris, inde nubilum trahunt colorem aut pro claritate
matutina serenum.
Margarite or pearl has such affinity with the sky, that if it be bred at
the opening of the shell fish in a clear morning, the color thereof is
clear, and the stone most orient: but if in a duskie evening, or when the
heaven is over-cast with clouds, the color thereof is darker, and the stone
less precious: so the hidden man of the heart is lightsome and cheerful when
Gods face shines upon him, but sad and dejected when heaven lowres upon him.
Without assurance that we are in the state of grace, and reconciled to God in
Christ, there is no comfort in life and death, because no sound joy, nor
settled peace within. Neither is it so easy a matter as some imagine to get
this assurance, or the knowledge thereof. For not only the sick patient, but
also sometimes the skillful Physician is deceived in the state of our body,
though all ordinary diseases have their certain symptoms by which they may be
known, even to sense: how much more difficult a thing is it certainly to
judge of the state of our soul? A man may set a good face on it, as Tiberius
did, and brave it out, yea and riot also, who yet has such a secret disease
which will make an end of him in a few hours. Nay, a man may take infection,
or receive some bruise inwardly, or spring some vein, and yet not know of it
till it be too late to cure it: in like manner, a man that makes great
profession of Religion, and carries a great appearance of piety and sanctity,
both at Church and in his own house, feeling no inward gripe of conscience,
may yet have taken some infection of Heresy, or have still in him some poison
of malice, or bruise of faction, or rupture of schism, or corrupt humors of
luxury, and daily decay in grace, and be in a spiritual consumption, and yet
perceive it not. I have no commission to ransacke any man's conscience, nor to
make privy search for concealed Idols, or masqued hypocrisy, or veiled
impudency, or closely conveyed bribery, or secretly vented luxury, or
statutable usurie, or legal simonie, or customary sacrilege. Only I will be
bold to say the least breach which any of the above named sins make in the
conscience, is like a small leake in the bottom of a Ship, which, if it be not
stopped in time, will drown the greatest vessel, fraught with the richest
merchandise. Your experience shows you that Bristow and Cornish stones, and
many other false gems, have such a luster in them, and so sparkle like true
jewels, that a cunning Lapidarie, if he be not careful, may be cheated with
them: such are the enlightening graces which shine in hypocrites, they so nearly
resemble the true sanctifying and saving graces of the Elect, that the eye of
spiritual wisdom it self may mistake them, if it be not single, and look
narrowly into them. Are not repentance from dead works, faith in Christ, peace
of conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost, the proper characters of a regenerate
Christian and an elect child of God? Yet Esau counterfeited the first: (the
Heb 12.17.
Apostle says that after he had sold his birthright he sought it with
tears.) Simon Magus the second: (St. Luke says he Acts 8.13.
believed.) The man possessed in the Gospel the third: (our Savior says all
things were in Luke 11.21.
peace in his house.) The Jews the fourth: (the text says they Joh. 5 35.
rejoiced at St. John's preaching.) Here then is work for spiritual wisdom
to discern Gib. in Cant. Qualis unguentorum artifex est satanas qui de mortis
olla vitae vapores exire simulat, and venenum quasi balsamum facit sp^are!
a sented poison from Balsamum, to distinguish tears of repentance, such as
Peter's were, from tears of discontent and revenge, such as Heb. 12.17.
Esau's were: a temporary faith, such as Act. 8.13.
Simon Magus his was, from a justifying, such as Luke 9.9.
Zacheus his was: a feared conscience, such as the Luke 11.21. When a strong
man armed keeps his Palace, his goods are in peace.
possessed man had, from a secured conscience, such as St. Acts 24.16.
Paul's was: lastly, a sudden exultation of the spirit, such as the John 5 ^5 Ye
were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
Jews was, from true joy in the holy Ghost, such as Psalm. 4.7.
David's was.

3. The third point of spiritual wisdom is, to consider what infirmities and
maladies of mind our natural constitution, state, place, or profession, or
course of life makes us most subject unto, and to furnish our selves with
store of remedies against them; to mark where we lie most open to temptation,
and there to have our ward ready. For Satan plays always upon advantage,
and for the most part boweth us that way to which we incline of our selves,
through the weakness of our nature: he sails ever with the wind. Is our
knowledge in matter of faith deficient? he tempts us to error. Is our
conscience tender? he tempts us to scrupulositie and too much preciseness.
Has our conscience like the eclipticke line some latitude? he tempts us to
carnal liberty. Are we bold spirited? he tempts us to presumption. Are we
timorous and distrustful? he tempts us to desperation? Are we of a flexible
disposition? he tempts us to inconstancy. Are we stiff? he labors to make
obstinate Heretics, Scismatikes, or Rebels of us. Are we of an austere temper?
he tempts us to cruelty? Are we soft and mild? he tempts us to indulgence
and foolish pity. Are we hot in matter of Religion? he tempts us to blind
zeal and superstition. Are we cold? he tempts us to Atheism and flat
irreligion. Are we moderate? he tempts us to Laodicean lukewarmednesse. The
Camelion when he lies on the grass to catch flies and grasshoppers, takes
upon him the color of the grass; as the Polypus does the color of the rock,
under which he lurketh, that the fish may boldly come near him without any
suspicion of danger: in like manner Satan turns himself into that shape which
we least fear, and sets before us such objects of temptation as are most
agreeable to our humors, natural desires, and inclinations, that so he may
the sooner draw us into his net. St. Greg. l. 29. mor. in Job. c. 38. Prius
conspersionem uniuscujusque antiquus adversarius perspicit, and tunc
tentationis laqueos apponit, alius namque laeti^, alius tristibus, alius
timidis, alius claris moribus existit. Qu^ ergo occultus adversarius facile
capiat vicinas conspersionibus deceptiones parat. Quia enim laetitiae voluptas
juxta est, laetis moribus luxuriem proponit and quia tristitia in i^am facile
labitur, tristibus poculum discordiae porr^git, paventibus terrores int^ntat,
and quia ela os extolli laudibus conspicit, eos blandis favoribus trahit:
singulis igitur hominibus vitiis convenientibus insidiatur.
Gregory long ago noted this subtle device of the wily serpent, he has,
says he, fit allurements for all sorts of men, as fishermen have baits for
fishes: for the luxurious he baiteth his hook with pleasure; for the
ambitious, with honor; for the covetous with gain; for the licentious with
liberty, for the factious with schism, for the studious with curiosity, for
the vainglorious with popularity. Here then is our spiritual wisdom seen
to be strong always, there where our enemy is like to lie in ambush, and
where he goes about to undermine us, to meet him with a countermine. To unfold
this precept of wisdom even to the meanest capacity: Art thou by nature a
lover of pleasure? bend thy whole strength against the sin of luxury. Art thou
of a fiery disposition? lay all upon it to bridle thy passion of anger, and
desire of revenge. Have thou too much earth in thy complexion, and art given to
the world? furnish thy self continually with spiritual levers to lift up thy
heart, and raise thy thoughts and affections to heaven and heavenly objects.
Does the eminency of thy place bring thee in danger of high mindedness? let
thy whole study be humility. Does thy profession incline thee to contention?
study peace: to dissembling and cousening? study honesty: to extortion and
exaction? study charity, and practice restitution: to corruption and receiving
the wages of iniquity? let all thy prayers and endeavors be for integrity.

Socrates was wont say, facile est Athenienses Athenis laudare, that it was no
unpleasing argument to commend the virtues of the Athenians at Athens: neither
will it seem burdensome I hope to recommend yet more instructions of wisdom
to you that are wise. God has spread abroad the heaven and the earth as large
samplars before our eyes, wherein every act of his special providence in
governing the affairs of the world is as a flower or curious piece of
drawne-worke, which a wise man ought to take out by observation, and work it
in his own life by imitation.

4. The fourth lesson therefore which wisdom reads to all those that have
ears to hear, is to observe the carriage of all affairs in this great City
of the world, and to set a mark upon Gods wonderful protection and care over
the godly, and his fearful judgments upon the wicked. From the former
spiritual wisdom gathers the sweet fruit of comfort, from the latter the
bitter fruit of terror, from both the most wholesome fruit of instruction. The
fruit of comfort she gathers by using Jacobs ladder to rest upon, when she is
weary, Hagars fountain to quench her thirst, the widows meal to sustain her
in famine, Jonah's gourd to shade her in heat, Jonathans honey to clear her
eyesight, Hezekia's figs to heal her plague-sores, the Samaritan's oil to
supple her wounds, and Christ's Cross to support her in all. The bitter fruit
of terror she gathers when she makes the drowning of the old world a
warning to her for security, the confusion of Languages at Babel for pride, the
burning of Sodom for unnatural lust, the pillar of salt into which Lot's wife
was turned for backsliding and disobedience, the plagues of Egypt for hardness
of heart, the captivity of Israel and Judah for Idolatry, and the final
destruction of the City and Temple for infidelity, and persecution of Christ
and his Gospel. When the Devil offers us any forbidden fruit, seem it never
so pleasant to the eye, let us think of Adam; when a wedge of gold, of Achan;
when red broth, of Esau; when a pleasant vineyard lying near to our house, of
Ahab; when a bribe, of Gehazi; when holy vessels to carouse in, of Belshazzar;
when money for the gifts of the holy Ghost, of Simon Magus; when the price of
innocent blood, of Judas; when a share in sacrilege, of Ananias. Let us learn
by Adams fall to shut our ears against evil counsel; by Noah's shame, to
abhor drunkenness; by David's adultery, to fly idleness; by Joseph's swearing
by the life of Pharaoh, to avoid ill company; by Peter's denial, to beware of
presuming on our own strength; by Paul's buffetting, to take heed of spiritual
pride. Do the students at the law follow all Courts, and are ready at all
assizes with their table-books to note what passes in all trials, to put down
the cases, and take the sentences of the Judges: and shall we neglect the
judgments of the Almighty, and not write down in the tables of our memories
such cases as are ruled in the Court of heaven? There is nothing will more
deject us in the opinion of our own wisdom, and stir us up to the admiration
of Gods wisdom, justice, and power, than to observe how he compasses the
wise of the world in their own ways, and shoots beyond them in their own
bow, and over-reacheth them in their highest designs: how he chooses the
foolish things of the world to convince and rebuke the wise; the weak things
of the world to conquer the mighty; the ignoble things of the world to obscure
the glorious; and the things that are not to confound the things that are. When
we see him draw light out of darkness, sweet out of sower, comfort out of
misery, joy out of sorrow, and life out of death, how can we distrust his
goodness? Again, when we see on the sudden how he turns day into night,
liberty into captivity, beauty into ashes, joy into heaviness, honor into
shame, wealth into want, rule into servitude, life into death, how can we but
fear his power? When we see Scepters made of mattocks, and mattocks of
Scepters; hovils of Palaces, and Palaces of hovils; valleys raised high, and
hills brought low, Kings cast out of their thrones to the ground, and poor
raised out of the dunghill to sit with Princes; how can we be proud? When we
observe the godly man like the Ox that goes to plow, worn out with labor and
pain, and the wicked like beasts fatted for the slaughter, abound with riotous
superfluity, how can we but be patient? When we see daily stars rise and fall
in the firmament of the Church, how can we then but be solicitous? Lastly, when
we see our wants as well as our wealth, our defects as well as our exceedings,
our falls as well as our risings, our sorrows as well as our joys, our fasts
as well as our feasts, our sickness as well as our health, our terrors as well
as our comforts, our crosses and afflictions as well as those we call blessings
work for the best for us, how can we but be content? This rule of wisdom
every man by his experience can easily draw out at length, and the time calls
upon me to cut the thread of this discourse: wherefore in a word I will now
deliver that precept of wisdom in the last place which in practice must
challenge the first, viz. that in all serious and weighty affairs, especially
such as concern our spiritual estate, we ask counsel of God, who among
other glorious attributes, described by the Prophet Isaiah, is styled the
wonderful Esaias 9.6. His name shall be called the wonderful counselor. A^oc.
3.18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold, etc.
Counselor, who freely gives us that counsel which cannot be got by any fee
from mortal man. Success crowns no great attempt which wisdom undertaketh
not: wisdom undertaketh nothing but by the advice of counsel, and no counsel
safe in deliberations of this kind but from the spirit of God. The Israelites
usually asked counsel of God by the Ephod, the Grecians by their Oracles, the
Persians by their Magi, the Egyptians by their Hirophantae, the Indians by
their Gymnosophistae, the ancient Gauls and Britains by their Druides, the
Romans by their Augures or Soothsayers. It was not lawful to propose any
matter of moment in the Senate, Cic. de Arusp. resp.
priusquam de coelo servatum erat, before their wisards had made their
observations from the heaven or sky. That which they did impiously and
superstitiously, we may, nay we ought to do in another sense piously, ( viz.)
not to imbark our selves into any action of great importance and consequence,
priusquam de coelo servavimus, before we have observed from heaven, not the
flight of birds, or houses of planets, or their aspects or conjuncti^ns, such
foul or star-gazing is forbid by a voice from heaven; but the countenance of
God, whether it shines upon our enterprises or not, whether he approve of our
endeavors, projects, and designs, or dislike them: if he approve of them we
need not fear the success: for if it be not good for the present, it shall be
good: if he dislike them we may not hope for success; for if the issue be not
bad for the present, it shall be bad in the end. Tullies resolution is good; Cic.
ep. ad At.
sapientis est nihil praestare praeter culpam, a wise man is to look to his
intentions, and to answer for his actions, that they be without blame, not to
undertake for the events. Let us make good our ends, and the means we use, and
God will make good the issue, and turn all to the best. A Pilot, as Quintilian
observes, cannot be denied his lawful plea dum clavum rectum teneam, though
the ship be cast away or drowned he is not to make satisfaction, so long as he
held the stern right, and guided it by the compass: in like manner, though our
actions and good intentions miscarrie in the event, we are not to be blamed if
we steered our course by the compass of Gods word: though the bark be cast
away, as St. Paul's was, the lives of all in it shall be safe: and our temporal
losses shall always turn to our spiritual and eternal advantage. Yea, but God
is in heaven, we are upon earth, how may we come to have speech with him, or
open our case to him, or receive answer from him? The Jews had two means to
receive answer from him, either by the mouth of the Prophets, when the spirit
was on them, or from the Priests, when they had put on the breast plate of
judgment: we have no such means now to enquire the will of God, neither are
visions nor dreams by which men in former times understood the pleasure of
God, now either frequent, or undoubted oracles of truth; yet have we still
means to advise with God both by prayer and consulting the holy Scriptures. Of
the former St. James speaks; Jam. 1.5.
If any man lack wisdom, that is, counsel and direction in his affairs,
let his ask it of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth not,
and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith nothing wavering, etc. Of
the second the Prophet David: Psalm. 119.24.
Thy testimonies are my delight and my counselors; in the Hebrew, men of my
counsel.

Having now composed the press, what remains but to clap it to the sheets, and
labor by a word of exhortation to print some of these rules in your hearts? Be
wise now, etc. Be wise, 1. In the choice of your wisdom: 2. Be instructed in
the means of your instruction, make choice of the wisdom that comes from
above from the Father of lights, not that which comes from beneath from the
Prince of darkness: receive instruction from the spirit, not from the flesh:
from God, not from the world: so shall you be wise unto salvation and
instructed to eternal life. Be your selves clients and suitors to God before
your clients and suitors have access unto you; ask counsel of him before you
give counsel to them: and content not your selves with the waters of the
brook or rivelet, but have recourse to the Cic. de orat. l. 2. Tard^ est
ingeni^ rivulos consectari, fontes rerum non videre.
fountain. Now the fountain of all law is the wisdom of God, as the wisest
of the heathen Lawgivers in effect acknowledged it: Zamolxis ascribing the
laws (he delivered to the people) to Vesta, Zoroaster to Hormasis,
Trismegistus to Mercury, Lycurgus to Apollo, Solon to Minerva, Numa to the
Nymph Aegeria, Minos to Jupiter. If time be well spent in searching records of
Courts, and evidences of conveyances, and titles of lands, how much better in
searching the holy Scriptures which are the records of heaven, the deeds of
Almighty God, and evidences of our salvation? Who would not search where he may
be sure to find treasure? In Scriptures you may be sure to find it, wherein
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid: the treasures of natural
Philosophy in Genesis; of moral Philosophy in Exodus, Deuteronomie, and
Ecclesiastes; of the Politickes in the Judicials of Moses, and the Proverbes of
Solomon; of Poetry in the Psalms; of History in the books of Chronicles,
Judges, and Kings; of the Mathematickes in the dimensions of the Arc and
Temple; of the Metaphysickes in the books of the Prophets and the Apocalypse.
Do you desire that the tree of your knowledge in the Law should spread far
and near, and that all men should shade themselves under your boughs? Water
the root of the tree which bears up your laws, and sends sap and life to
all the branches thereof, and that is true religion: for Psalm. 111.10.
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and a good understanding
and care have all they that follow after it. First, to look to the maine
chance, and provide for their eternal estate in another world: next, to learn
certainly that they are in state of grace here: thirdly, to observe where they
are weakest, and there to strengthen themselves against the assaults of the
enemy: fourthly, to make use of the history of the world, and comment upon
the special works of Gods providence: lastly, to entertain God his Prophets
and Apostles for their learned counsel, to direct them in all their suits in
the Court of heaven, and managing all their weightiest affairs on earth: so
shall they be sure to attain that which David so earnestly sought of God by
prayer, saying, Psalm. 73.24.
Guide me by thy counsel, and after that receive me to thy glory. To whom, etc.

THE JUDGES CHARGE. A Sermon preached at the Readers Feast in LINCOLNES Inn.
THE NINTH SERMON.
PSALM. 2.10. Be instructed, or learned, ye Judges of the earth.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
AT the siege of Tarentum, Aelian. de Var. hist. l. 5.
when the Citizens were driven by extremity of famine to the point of yielding
themselves into the hands of the Romans, they were strangely relieved by the
charity of their neighbors at Rhegium, who every tenth day fasted themselves,
and sent in their provision for that day to the Tarentines. In memory of which
relief they kept ever after a feast which they called Jejunium, o^ Festum
jejunii, the Fasts feast, or a feast grounded on a fast. Such is the Feast bid
at this time in this place, gained by a long prescription out of the Lent Fast.
It may rightly be called Festum Jejunii, the Feast of the Fast; a Feast of the
Law beside, if not contrary to the Law of Feasts appointed by the Church.
Wherein yet I conceive, according to the right meaning of the first founders of
this exercise and Feast, the Ecclesiastical cannons of the Church, and local
statutes of these houses do not harshly clash one against the other; but
rather like strings tuned alike, and dexterously touched, make a perfect chord,
and strike full unisons, both intending Festum Jejunii; the one a spiritual,
the other a scholasticall; the one an Evangelicall, the other a Legal Feast in
the time of Fast. For the Church appoints more frequent exercises of piety
and devotion, Prayers, Lectures, and Sermons, (which are the souls dainties)
at this time, than any other season of the year. And agreeable hereunto in the
Universities, which are the Nurseries of Religion and Arts, and in these noble
Seminaries of justice, and knowledge in the laws, the most solemn and
profitable exercises for the proficiencie of students, (whether readings,
disputations, or determinations) have been, time out of mind, and are yet
performed in the Lent: wherein the eye of the soul is the more apt and single
for the contemplation of divine and humane knowledge, by how much it is freer
from the fumes of bodily meats, and the smoke of worldly cares and business.
As for the exceeding in some one day or other in variety of all palate
provocations, it is a vain thing for me or any other to speak against it;
quia venture non habet aures, the belly has no ears, especially to hear any
thing against it self. If it had, I should have craved a Writ of remove of
these Vitellian feasts out of the confines of Lent, or made a motion, that
these surcharges of purse and stomach might be turned into the Lacedaemonian
Phiditia were sparing meals, or frugall seasts: so named from ecl. (...)
signifying to spare or be thrifty.
Phiditia, or at least that the superaboundancie in them might not be wasted by
luxury, to the hurt of our own bodies, but dispensed by charity to the
relief of others; that devotion might recover that in alms deeds which it
loses in fasting: so would our tender and indulgent Mother, Christ's dearest
Spouse the Church, vouchsafe these meetings her presence, as Mary the Mother of
Jesus was present at the Feast in Cana; and Christ himself would furnish the
wine of spiritual joy and gladness, even at these Feasts, though, like Saint
Paul, 1 Cor. 15.8.
borne out of due time.

But I leave the time, and have an eye to the notes pricked in my text, which
are three: 1. Religion enjoyneth learning: Be learned. 2. Learning becomes
and qualifieth Judges: Ye Judges. 3. Judges give sentences of, and rules for
land: The earth.


1. Divine wisdom excludes not humane learning: Be learned.

2. Learning is not only a comely ornament, but a necessary accoustrement of a
Judge: Ye Judges.

3. All Judges on earth are Judges of earth, that is, consisting of earth, or
sitting upon the earth: The earth. The earth is their materia ex qua, and circa
quam too. 1. The matter of which they are made. 2. The matter on which they
make and give their judgment and sencence.


O all ye Kings of these Netherlands, manum ad Sceptrum, oculos ad Astra: there
is a King above who over-lookes you all, and will one day break your Scepters
with his Iron mace. O ye Judges of this lower Circle and Circuits, manum ad
Gladium, oculos ad Astra: there is a Judge of heaven who will set his tribunal
in the clouds, and call all you to his bar, and your judgments in question
before him. Be wise now therefore O ye Kings, advance his Kingdom in yours: be
learned ye Judges of the earth, declare his judgment by yours.

Tullie gives this character of Thacydides, that in his writings there are
near as many Cic. declar. orat. Numerum verborum numero sententiarum pene
consecutus est.
sentences as words: such is the Rhetorike of this parcel of holy writ, the
parts are answerable to the words, the points of doctrine to the parts, the
uses to the points of doctrine. 1 Erudimini, there is the charge. 2 Judices,
there is the style. 3 Terrae, there is the circuit of the Judges.
1 Be learned, there is the aim of your study. 2 Ye Judges, there is the
title of your place. 3 Of the earth, there is the emblem of your frailty.


These parts hold good correspondence; 1 The first with this present exercise.
2 The second with this honorable auditory. 3 The third with this holy time.
1 It is most agreeable at a Reading to treat of learning, Be ye learned. 2 It
is most proper to give the Judges charge before the prime Judges of the
kingdom, Ye Judges. 3 It is most seasonable to frame a discourse of the mould
of us all, earth and ashes, in the time of Lent, Of the earth.


By the law the Levit. 1.16. And ye shall pluck away the filth thereof with his
feathers, and cast it besides the Altar, by the place of the ashes.
crop, or as it is in the Hebrew, the filth of the birds that were sacrificed,
together with their feathers, were to be cast in locum cinerum, into the place
of ashes. Now if ever is the season not only to purge or remove the filth of
our lives out of the sight of God, but also to cast away the beautiful pompes,
maskes, shows, and all oaths vanities of the world, which are no better than
feathers in locum tinerum, where we ought to mourn for our sins in
sacke-cloth and ashes; pulvis and cinis, dust and ashes have great affinity
with terrae in my text.

Be learned. When Cic. de orat l. 1. Neque tam molestus mibi fuit Antonius,
quod jus nostrum civil pervellit, quam jucundus quod se id nescire confessus
est.
Antony carped at the study of the civil law, withal acknowledging his small
sight therein, Scaevola a great Lawyer smiling, said, that he made a kind of
amends for his invective against the Law, by professing his ignorance therein.
For it is no disparagement to any science or profession to be slighted by
such as understand it not. A bright beam and great light troubles, and
dazeleth, and paineth also a weak eye, Urit enim fulgore suo. Who can blame
Peti. Dialect^cum criminatur, sed cum ad interrogata respondere non possit.
Petilian the Donatist for complaining of Saint Austins Logic, whereby that
ignorant Heretic was non-plussed and shamed? Verily as fast has no enemy but
gluttony, chastity but lust, frugality but luxury, wisdom but folly,
humility but pride, orthodoxe doctrine but heresy, so neither knowledge but
ignorance. Wherefore whatsoever fair gloss of the Scriptures
selfe-sufficiency the Brownists and Separatists put upon their secret
undermining of our Schools and Universities, and stopping up the Well-springs
of good Learning among us, their true end is, that Eras. adag Inter coecos
luscum regnare posse.
among blind men they might be some body, who among sharpe-sighted men are no
body. For the Latin proverb puts them in some heart, (viz.) that a purblinde
man may be a jolly fellow, nay by good reason chosen a King among such as are
stark blind. Doubtless, if ever learning were needful, it is now adays
most necessary, when men by subtle Sophistry, and deceivable eloquence, not
only go about to wrangle us out of our estates, but also juggle us out of our
Religion. Call ye it a reformation? is it not rather the deformation of a
building to damb up the lights thereof? The state of Aelian de var. hist. l. 3.
Gravissima (...) poe^am inflixerunt ut libe^os suos non docerent literas.
Mi^ylene desiring to be revenged to the uttermost on their Confederates that
had revolted from them, after they had got the mastery of them, laid this as
the forest punishment they could devise upon them; that none of their children
should go to school, or be brought up in learning. And in a like regard
Julians persecution was accounted more grievous than that of Dioclesian, though
that blasphemous Apostata shed little Christian blood; in as much as Dioclesian
plucked but out the bodily eyes of Saints and Martyrs, (the holes whereof the
good Emperor Constantine kissed) whereas Julian by shutting up all Christian
schools, and bereaving them of the light of knowledge, after a sort plucked
out the eyes of their souls. Which I speak not for that I conceive the
Scriptures are not sufficient of themselves for our instruction, to enlighten
our understanding; but because we are not sufficient for the opening of the
meaning of them, without the helps of arts and sciences, the miraculous gifts
of the holy Ghost ceasing long before our time. The light of diverse rapers in
the same room, though united, yet is not confounded, as the optics
demonstrate, by the distinct shadows which they cast: neither does the light
of divine knowledge confound that of humane in the soul, but both concur to
the full illumination of the understanding. And as the organe of the bodily eye
cannot discern any thing without a double light, viz. 1. Brierhood tractat de
oculo M.S.
Lumine innato, an inward light in the christalline humor of the eye. 2.
Lumine illato, an outward light in the air, and on the object:
so neither can the eye of the soul in this region of darkness perfectly
distinguish the colors of good and evil without a double light, the inbred
light of nature, and the outward light which is acquired by learning; being
Lumen not innatum, but illatum: not naturally resplendent in the soul, and
brought with it into the world, but ab extrinseco, brought into the soul by
reading, hearing, discoursing, contemplating, or divine inspiration. Solomon

Mat. 13.52.
Christ himself compares every Scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom
of heaven, to a man that is an householder, who brings out of his treasury new
things and old. He likeneth him not to a peddler that has nothing but inkle,
tape, and such like trash in his pack, which he opens at every man's door;
but to a rich warehouse man, who out of his treasury or warehouse brings
out precious things, either new or old, as they are called for. Such a Scribe
was Moses, who Acts 7.22.
was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. Such a Scribe was Daniel
and the four children that were bred up with him, to whom God Dan. 1.17.
gave knowledge and skill in all learning. Such a Scribe was S. Paul, who was
Act. 22.3.
brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner
of the Law of the Fathers. Neither was he conversant only in the writings of
the Rabbines, but also expert in the heathen Philosophers, Orators and Poets,
whom he after a sort defloureth of their choicest sentences and observations,
incorporating them into his most learned and eloquent epistles. Such a Scribe
was Clemens Alexandrinus, whose writings in regard of all variety of good
literature in them, are called stromata, rare pieces of Arras or Tapestry. Such
a Scribe was S. Cyprian, who by Rhetoric; Tertullian, who by the civil Law;
Justin Martyr, and Origin, who by Philosophy; S. Basil, who by Physic; S.
Austin, who by Logic; Eusebius, who by history; Prudentius, who by Poetry;
Gregory Nazianzen, Jerome, and many other of the ancient Doctors of the Church,
who by exquisite skill in the Arts and learned Languages, exceedingly improved
their sacred talent of Scripture-knowledge. Vid. Lyps. Manuducti ad Stoicam
Philosophiam.
Philo that accomplished Jew devises an elegant allegory upon Abraham's
companying with Hagar, before he could have issue by Sara. Hagar the bondwoman
is secular or humane learning, with which we must have to do, before we can
promise our selves fruit by Sarah, that is, much profit by the study of
divinity. Neither does this argue any imperfection in the Scriptures, but in
us: the stars are most visible in themselves, yet through the imbecility of
our sight, without a perspective glass we cannot exactly take their elevation,
or true magnitude.

What though God in the first plantation of the Gospel used the industry of
illiterate men, and made Fishermen fishers of men, that our 1 Cor. 2.5.
faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God? yet
after the miraculous gifts of the Spirit failed in the Church, we shall read
of no Rams horns, but Silver Trumpets employed in the throwing down of
Satan's forts. Since that, the promise of dabitur in illa hora, it shall be
given you in that hour, is turned into the precept of attend lectioni, give 1 Timothy 4.13.15
attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, meditate upon these
things, give thy self wholly unto them, that thy profiting may appear unto
all men. Since the days of the Apostles, and their immediate Successors, the
learned men have proved the worthiest instruments of Gods glory in Church or
Commonwealth: Be learned therefore.

Ye Judges. Religion commends learning, and learning a Judge: Numb. 11.17.
The Lord took of the Spirit which was upon Moses, and put it upon seventy
Elders. This Spirit it is which animateth a Judge, whose briefest and yet
fullest definition is Jus animatum, enlived right, or the living law. For the
law is a dead and mute Judge, and the Judge is a living and speaking law: As
the Philosopher terms Arist. Rhet. l. 3. Pictura muta poesis, poesis loquens
pictura.
painting silent Poetry, and Poetry a speaking picture. Now how can a Judge
speak the law, or the law speak by him, if he know not the law? It implies a
kind of contradiction for an Actor to be without action, or an Orator without
words, or a Labourer without work, or a Counselor without advice, or a Judge
without judgment in the law. Can an Artificer work by his rule, who holds
it not in his hand? or a Pilot steer by the compass who has not the compass
before his eye, or understands it not? no more can a Judge give sentence
according to the law, who is ignorant of the law. Ignorance in a private man is
a prejudice, and some blemish to himself, but Aug. de civ. Dei. Ignorantia
Judicis est calamitas innocentis.
ignorance in a Judge is the calamity of the innocent, nay may prove the ruin
of a State. What greater mischief in any society than that the estates, good
name, livelihood, yea and lives too of men should lie in the breast of a Judge,
who out of ignorance is feign to ask Quid est justitia, what is justice? as
Pilate did, Quid est veritas, what is the truth? How will the Lawyers work upon
this advantage? how far will the Counsel go in a bad cause, upon the strength
of a large fee? what false glasses will they set before the eyes of such a
Judge to deceive him, and lead him by the nose? Neither will skill in the
municipall law alone suffice, and yet that law has a large walk, and many
turnings where he may lose his way: he must be well experienced in the
affairs of the world: he must sink deep into men's dispositions as well as
their speeches: he must be able to weigh reasons, poyze witnesses, reconcile
laws, compare presidents: in a word, he must be like an Angel of God to
discern between good and evil. Among the many titles of a good Judge, who is
styled the soul of the law, the oracle of the city, the priest of justice, the
tutour of pupils, the father of orphans, the sanctuary of innocents unjustly
pursued, me thinks none so fitteth him as Regula, or rather Arist. Rhet. l. 1.
Regulator juris, a rule, or rather, the ruler of right. For orders in Court
you call rules, and judge cases in law, ruled cases: now that a man may rule
well, that is, in your phrase judge well, six things are requisite. 1 That he
has skill to rule, 2 That his paper, or parchment be spread abroad, and lie
even before him, 3 That his eye be on his rule, 4 That he have nothing in his
hand save his pen or plummet, 5 That his hand on his ruler be steady, 6 That
his hand on his plummet be quick, to draw a line speedily.


Upon these six ruled lines we may write a fair copy for a Judge, according
to the form following. 1 He must have skill to rule, knowledge to judge. 2 He
must have his paper or parchment spread, that is, the case unfolded before him.
3 He must fix his eye on his rule, which is the law. 4 He must have nothing in
his hand but that wherewith he rules, he must be empty-handed. 5 His hand on
his ruler must be steady, it must not shake through fear. 6 His hand on his
plummet or pen must be swift and ready, he must have a desire and dexterity to
rid work out of his hand, and speedily to set a period to tediously protracted
suits.


I had forgot one more circumstance if the last word of my text (earth) had not
put me in mind of it, which is this: That a man cannot well rule, or draw
exact lines by a ruler upon his paper or parchment, but he must needs how
himself and look down up on it: neither can any man be a good Judge who is
not humble. For Lypsius truly observes that it is a very hard thing for a man
Lyp polit. l. 4. Difficile est in alto positum non alta sapere.
in high place not to be high minded. Sen. de ira. l. 2. c. 21. Quicquid leve
and inanc in animo est, secunda fortuna sustollit, etc.
Honor lifts up the heart above measure, especially when it is armed with
power. Knowledge also puffs up, especially when it is blown with the breath
of flattery. Wherefore lest wise Kings and learned Judges should too much
reflect upon the eminency of their place and gifts, and forget the frailty of
their condition, the Prophet gives them an alloy in the word immediately
following the title of their dignities, Terrae, of the earth.

Of the earth. When Bees are most angry in their swarming, cast but a little
earth upon them, and they are presently quiet, and leave their humming. Though
nothing else can Plin l. 1. c. 104. 106. Limum flagrantem, maltham dictam,
terra tantum extingui docuere experimenta. Ignem montis Chimaerae extingui
terra and fimo tradit Guidias.
quench the burning slime of Samosaris, or the fire in the hill Chimaera, yet
earth and dung can: so though nothing else can assuage the tumor of the proud,
or quench the burning desire of honor in the ambitious, of wealth in the
covetous, of pleasure in the voluptuous, yet the consideration of the grave
can. He that seriously thinks with himself, these scarlet robes of mine
clothe nothing but dung, all my dainty fare feeds but worms; I who have power
of other men's lives, have no power of my own life, no not for a moment; even
whilst I sit upon prisoners, and condemn guilty persons, I am arraigned in my
conscience, and plead guilty before God. He that keeps down his heart with
these thoughts, can no more be overthrown with pride, than a ship which is
well ballast be blown away in a storm. Great personages, the stronger guard
they have about them, the more they lie open to envy: the more secure they are
by their authority, the more in danger they are of surprizall by pride. Judges
were Princes among the Jews before the days of Saul, and Princes were Judges
among the Romans, as Augustus and Adrian. I find the title of Psalm. 82.1. God
stands in the congregation of the mighty, he judges among the Gods. and v.
6. I have said ye are Gods.
Gods in Scripture attributed not only to Sovereign Kings, who are the
supreme Judges, but to inferior Judges also, subordinate to Princes: their
Bodin. de rep c. 4. Lex Horatia est, Jovi sacrum esse caput ejus qui Judici
nocuerit.
persons by the Roman laws were sacred, he who hurt them was presently to be
sacrificed. In France when a Gallant in his ruff struck a Judge, by an arrest
of the Parliament at Paris his hand was suddenly cut off, and a heavy fine
laid upon him. The privileges of Judges granted to them by Princes, in whose
seat they sit, their power, their wealth, their clyents, their retinue, their
robes, their maces, their officers, their titles will exalt them too high in
their own conceit, if they consider not with Trajan, Plin. in panegyr. Se non
minus hominem esse, quam hominibus prae esse cogitet.
that though they are above men, yet they are but men. Pliny the elder having
related a strange story of a child, whose life was taken away by the snuff of
a candle, takes all the potentates of the earth to task, and rings them a
peale in their ear, saying, Plin. not. hist. l. 7. c. 7. Tu qui te deum credis
aliquo successu, tamen tanti perire potuisti, atque etiamnum potes aut minoris,
ut Anacreon acino uvae, and Fabius Praeto^ in lactis haustu pilo.
Thou which art so puffed up with the happy success of some battle fought by
thee, or some great fortune fallen unto thee, that thou take thy self to be
a God, may purchase thy death at as low a rate as this child, or a lower, as
Anacreon the Poet came to his end by a raisin stone, and Fabius the Praetor by a
hair in his milk. No posture of the body seems more secure than sitting in
a chair, yet Judge Aug de civit. Dei, l. 22. c. 22. Quid videtur sedente
securius? de sella cecidit Eli, and mortuus est.
Ely fell out of his chair, and brake his neck. Wherefore since Judges
themselves are as subject to the laws of humane frailty as other men, since
for ought they know they are as near death as the prisoner whom they have
newly condemned to dye: let them look above them, not about them; let them
fear God, not man; let them deliver nothing at the bench, which they are not
assured in their consciences that they are able to make good before the Judge
of quick and dead, from whose face heaven and earth fled away, and their place
could no where be found.

Judges may be considered either as of a particular circuit of the earth, and
so they must receive instruction from the King or Lord of that land: or as
Judges of the earth at large, and in that regard must take their Commission,
and receive Instruction from the Lord of the whole earth, who requires in his
Judges, 1 Religion, Exodus 18.21.

1 Want of Religion makes a profane Judge. 2 Want of Moderation an unmercifull
Judge. 3 Want of Learning an unsufficient Judge. 4 Want of Integrity a corrupt
Judge. 5 Want of Indifferency a partial Judge. 6 Want of Attention a rash
Judge. 7 Want of Expedition a tedious Judge. 8 Want of Resolution a timorous
Judge. 9 Want of Equity an unrighteous Judge. Lastly, Want of any of these an

1 Religion is required in a Judge, without which there will be no conscience
of doing justice, where injustice may be borne out: and because even religious
men are subject to passion, to religion a Judge must add

2 Moderation and government of his passions: and because a man of temper, fit
for a Judge, may mistake his mark, if he be not expert in the Law, to
moderation he must add

3 Learning and knowledge in the Law, according to which he is to give
sentence: and because bribes blind the Deuteronomy. 16.19.
eyes of the wisest and learned Judges, to learning he must add

4 Integrity and incorruption, a sincere heart, and clear hands: and because
where bribes cannot open the hand, yet favor may enter at the eye, to his
Integrity he must add

5 Indifferency, free from all kind of partiality: and because a Judge,
though never so religious, temperate, learned, incorrupt, and impartial,
cannot yet give right judgment without a full hearing and exact discussing of
the cause before him, to indifferency he must add

6 Patient Attention, and diligent Deuteronomy. 19.18.
inquisition: and because the plaintiff or defendant are nothing benefited by
the Judges hearing of, or searching into the cause, if after examination there
follow not a sentence, to Attentition he must add

7 Expedition; for delayed justice oftentimes as much wrongeth the plaintiff as
injustice: and because after enquiry and hearing, though the Judge be expert
and ready, yet judgment may be stopped if a great person appear in the
cause, to Expedition he must add

8 Courage and Resolution: and because if a Judge strike too hard with the
sword of justice he may break it, as also because the sentence of the law may
be just in general, yet in regard of difference in circumstances may wring and
wrong a man in particular, to all the former virtues a complete Judge must add

9 Levit. 19.15. In equity shall thou judgethy neighbor.
Equity and stayed discretion, which holds steedily the gold weights of
justice, and adds or takes away a grain or more to make the piece and
weight perfectly agree.

1. Religion. Alvares reports that the Aethiopians place many chaires about
the Judges seat, not out of State, but out of Religion, supposing that their
Gods fit there with their Judges. That which they suppose we certainly know,
that God and his Angels are present at the Assizes, and that he judges among
the Psalm. 82.1.7.
gods, that is, the Judges, or Princes. How religious then ought Judges to be,
who are Almighty Gods Assessours? So near is the affinity between Justice and
Religion, that as Priests are called Judices sacrorum, Judges of Religion, and
causes Ecclesiastical; so Judges are by Ulpian styled Sacerdotes justitiae,
Priests of justice. And not only the high Priests among the Jews, but also the
Archontes of the Athenians, the Archiflamines and Cic pro domo sua ad
Pontifices. Cum multa divinitus Pon^ifices a majoribus nostris in venta atque
instituta sunt, tum nihil praeclarius quam quod vos cosdem, and religionibus
deorum immortalium, and summae reipublicae prae esse voluerunt.
Pontifices of the Romans, the Muphteyes of the Turks, the Brameres of the
Indians, the Druides of the ancient Britains were trusted with Justice as
well as Religion, and that for important considerations. For since mortal men
cannot prescribe against God, nor dispense with his commandments, since the
divine law is the supreme law to which lies an appeal from all humane
statutes and ordinances; they who by their calling are Interpreters of that
law, might well be thought fit Umpires in all controversies concerning the
equity of laws, and conformity to the divine: especially in such points
wherein the laws trench upon holy things. But I list not in the heat of modern
oppositions to drink of the waters of strife: let that question pass, whether
sacred persons, expert in the divine law, are not fittest to judge in secular
causes of greatest moment: this I am sure, Judges must be, if not in orders,
yet eminently religious and skillful in the law of God: for the judgment they
are to give is Deuteronomy. 1.17.
Gods. If a Judge be not religious, he will never be zealous for Gods honor,
nor severely punish the breaches of the first Table. If a Judge fear not God,
he will fear the face of man, and fly back when he should stand out for a
poor innocent against a mighty adversary.

Martial. epig.
Contra libertum Caesaris ire timens. If a Judge make no account of giving one
day an account of all his actions to the supreme Judge of quick and dead, he
will make no consscience of delaying justice, or denying it, or perverting it,
or stifling it, or selling it. Justice shall be cast in her own Court, and
overthrown upon her own Tribunal. The Judge Cypr. l. 2. ep. 2. Inter leges
delinquitur, inter jura peccatur, innocentia nec ubi defenditu^ servabitur.

Sen. de ira l. 2. Quam turpes lites, quam turpiores advocatos habent? Judex
damnaturus quae fecit, eligitur: and corona pro mala causa, bona patroni voce
corrupta. Lactan. divin. instit. l. 1.


who sits on the bench to punish delinquents, will prove the greatest
delinquent, and dye his dibaphum or bis tinctum, his twice died scarlet the
third time with innocent blood. If a Judge depend upon the King, and not upon
God, Seianus shall be condemned to a most painful and ignominious death,
upon a bare letter from Tiberius, though no man know for what crime, or upon
what evidence: nay a Pilate will condemn Jesus himself to be crucified,
rather than not be thought a friend to Caesar. If a Judge be like Cardinal
Caraffa, securus de numine, out of all fear of Gods vengeance, he will make
the law a snare, and justice a net, and the bench a step to his own
advancement: He will either like Hercules Priest, play with one hand for
Hercules, and the other for himself: Or like Mazar. in Ps. 51.
Ayat the Jew, utraque manu tanquam dextra uti, take bribes on both sides, and
do Justice on neither.

2 A Judge must be a religious man, and none but such ought to be called to the
bench, yet neither are all religious men fit to be Judges; for beside the fear
of God and devotion in a Judge, there must be temper in him, and singular
moderation: he must be a Moses, Numb. 12.3.
a very meek man above all the men that were upon the face of the earth: the
mind of a Judge should be as still and calm as the upper region of the air:
Perpetuum nulla temeratum nube serenum.

For it is impossible for him clearly to discern between man and man, cause
and cause, blood and blood, there being colorable pretenses on both sides,
whose eye is clouded with passion, or overcast with any mist of prejudice. When
the water is troubled, or mingled with mud, we see not a bright pearl or piece
of silver in the bottom: in like manner when the mind is stirred and troubled
with perturbations, we cannot discern the truth, which for the most part lies
not in the top, but in the bottom, as it were, of a deep Well, according to
Democ. dixit veritatem in fundo demersam.
Democritus his emblem. In this consideration the Areopagite Judges prohibited
Orators to play their Prizes of wit before them, or go about any way by
figures of amplification and exaggeration to move any affection in them, of
love, or hatred, or fear, or anger, or envy, or pity. And Arist. Rhet. l. 1.
c. 1 (...).
Aristotle yields a good reason for it; It is the part of an unskilful and
foolish artificer, says he, to endeavor to bow or crook his own rule whereby
he is to work: Now the understanding of a Judge is, as it were, the rule and
square by which all causes are to be tried, and justice met out. By indirect
means then to pervert the mind of the Judge, and deprave his judgment, what
is it else in an Advocate or Pleader, than to crook his own square, and
falsify the common measure of right? Most certain it is, that as meat tastes
not a like to a clear stomach, and to a stomach repleat with ill humors, so
that no matter in debate presents it self in the like hue to a single and
clear eye, and to a dazzled or blood-shot. Let S. James give the Judges their
Motto, Be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. Vellaius Pater l. 1.
hist. Quicquid voluit valde voluit Brutus, nimium Cassius.
Brutus would have made an ill judge, who was affianced to his own will: and
Cassius a worse, who was wedded to it: and Herod worst of all, of whom Josephus
gives this character, that he was Legis dominus, irae servus, Lord of the law,
yet a slave to his own passion. It is no strong piece that will easily be out
of frame: frame therefore and temper must needs be in a Judge; yet this will
not serve without a great measure of

3 Knowledge and learning in laws, 1 Divine. 2 Humane.


As also in causes 1 Ecclesiastical. 2 Secular: of which before.
1 Civil. 1 Municipall.


4 Integrity. Probe doctus est qui probus est, he is entirely learned who to
his learning has added integrity. Learning teaches what is wrong as well as
what is right, and without integrity instructs a Judge how to make wrong
pass for right in a legal form. If a Judges eye be open to favor, or his
hand to gifts, his learning will serve him to no other end, than cunningly to
divert the straight current, to bring water to his own Mill. He that opens his
hand to catch after a great reward, cannot choose but let fall his rule out of
it. In which regard the Rainold. com. in Rhet. Arist. l. 1.
Thebanes pourtraying a Judge, drew a venerable personage in a sacred habit,
fitting still in a chair, having neither eyes nor hands; his sacred habit
represented his religion, his venerable years, his learning and experience;
his still sitting, his moderation; his eyes out, his indifferency or
impartiality; his want of hands, his integrity or freedom from taking bribes.
Mazar. com. in Psalm. 51.
Mazarinus complains of the Judges beyond the sea (and there let them still
be) that they resembled the boodstone, which has a special property to
stanch blood, yet it is observed by Jewellers, that it never exercises this
virtue, nor stancheth blood, unless it be set in, or covered over with silver,
and so applied to the vein. How true this is I know not, but sure I am that
those who use a silver plummet draw black lines. When Demosthenes, having
received a large fee of the adverse party to be silent in a cause, and being
called to plead pretended the Squinsie, his clyent handsomely came over him,
saying, (...), non est ista angina, sed argentangina. I could match such an
Advocate with a like Judge in Poland called Ictus, who a long time stood for a
poor plaintiff against a rich defendant, in the end took of the defendant a
great sum of money, stamped according to the usual stamp of the country,
with the Image of a man in complete armor, and at the next Sessions in court
judged the cause in favor of the defendant: and being taxed for it by his
friends in private, showing them the coin he received, demanded of them, quis
possit tot armatis resistere? who were able to stand against so many in
complete armor? Steel armor is bullet or musket proof, but nothing except
the fear of God is gold or silver proof. Nothing can keep a Judge from
receiving a reward in private, in a colorable cause, but the eye of the
Almighty, who sees the corrupt Judge in secret, and will reward him openly, if
not in his lower Courts on earth, yet in his high Court of Star Chamber in
heaven.

5 All corruption is not in bribes; he who for hope of advancement or for
favor, or for any by-respect whatsoever perverteth judgment, is not clear
from corruption, though his hands be clean. The Judges who absolved the
beautiful strumpet Phryne, had their hands clean, but their eyes foul. The
Judges who absolved Murena, that by indirect means purchased the Consulship of
Rome, are not taxed for taking any bribe from him, yet was their judgment
corrupt, because that which swayed them in judgment was not the innocence of
Murena, but his modest carriage, together with his sickness then upon him,
moving them unto compassion. An upright Judge must in a moral sense be like
Melchisedek, without Father or Mother, kiffe or kin; I mean in justice he
must take no notice of any affinity or consanguinity, friendship or favor, or
any thing else, save the merits of the cause; to which

6 He must give a full hearing: for otherwise the Poet will tell him, that
Sen. in med. Qui aliquid statuit part inaudita altera, aequum licet statuerit,
baud aequus est.
though the sentence he gives may be just, yet he cannot be just. The ear is
not only the sense of discipline or learning, as the Philosopher speaks, but
of faith also, as the Apostle teaches, yea and of truth also and justice.
Though a Judge need not with Philip stop one of his ears while the accuser is
speaking; yet ought he always to reserve an ear for the defendant, and
according to the ancient decree of the Areopagites, Demost. orat. de coron.
(...).
hear both parties with like attention and indifferency their full time.
Albeit our Lord and Savior knew the hearts of men, which no earthly Judge can;
yet to prescribe a rule to all Judges, he professes, sicut audio sic judico;
Joh. 5.30.
as I hear so I judge. Never any Roman Emperor was so much censured with
injustice and folly as Sueton. in Claud.
Claudius Caesar, and the reason why he so often mistook, was, because he
often sentenced causes upon the hearing of one side only, and sometimes upon the
full hearing of neither. But of hearing you hear every day, not only the
Preachers at the Assizes, but the Counsel on both parts call upon you for it:
I would you heard as often of that which I am to touch in the next place (without
which hearing is to no purpose:)

7 Expedition. If the time had not prevented me, I would have long insisted
upon the prolonging of suits in all Courts of justice. For a man can come into
none of them but he shall hear many crying with him in the Poet, Quem das
finem Rex magne laborum? When shall we leave turning Ixions wheel, and rolling
Sisyphus stone? O that we had an end either way! long delayed justice often
more wrongeth both parties, than injustice either. I am not ignorant of the
colorable pretense wherewith many excuse these delays, affirming that
questions in law are like the heads of Hydra, when you cut off one there arise
up two in the place of it: which if it were so, as it argues a great
imperfection in our laws, which they who are best able make no more haste to
supply, than beggars to heal the raw flesh; because these gain by such
defects, as they by showing their sores: so it no way excuses the protraction
of the ordinary suits, disputes, and demurres, in which there is no more true
controversy in point of law, than head in a sea-crab.

8 Of courage and resolution I shall need to add nothing to what has been
spoken, because the edge of your sword of justice has a strong back, the
authority of a most religious and righteous Prince, under whom you need not
fear to do justice, but rather not to execute justice upon the most potent
delinquent.

9 There remains nothing but Equity to crown all your other virtues, which
differs but little from moderation above enforced; for moderation is equity
in the mind, as equity is moderation in the sentence. Be not over just, says
Eccl. 7.16.
Solomon, but moderate thy justice with equity, and mitigate it with mercy, for
summum jus est summa injuria; justice without mercy is extreme cruelty, and
mercy without justice is foolish pity; both together make Christian equity.
Therefore these two virtues resemble Castor and Pollux, which if either alone
appear on the mast, is ominous, but both together promise a prosperous voyage:
or like the metals, which are so termed, quia (...), because the veins succeed
one the other: after the vein of one metal you fall upon the vein of
another: so in scripture you shall find a sequence of these virtues, as in the
Prophet Micah, Micah 6.8.
He has showed thee O man what is good: and what does the Lord require of
thee, but to do justly, and love mercy? and in Zechary, Zech. 7.9.
Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his
brother: and in Solomon, Pro. 21.21.
He that follows after righteousness and mercy, finds life,
righteousness, and honor.

To gather then up at length the scattered links of my discourse, to make a
golden chain for your necks, Be instructed O ye Judges of the earth, either
Judges made of earth, earthly men, or made Judges of the earth, that is,
controversies about lands, tenures, and other earthly and temporal causes,
serve the Lord of heaven in fear, and rejoice unto him with trembling, be
religious in your devotion, moderate in your passions, learned in the laws,
incorrupt in your courts, impartial in your affections, patient in hearing,
expedite in proceeding, resolute in your sentence, and righteous in judgment
and execution: So when the righteous Judge shall set his tribunal in the
clouds, and the unrighteous Judge, as being most contrary to him, shall receive
the heaviest doom; ye that are righteous Judges, as being likest to him, shall
receive a correspondent reward, and be taken from sitting upon benches on
earth, to be his Assessours on his throne in heaven: To whom, etc.

He that will blazon the arms of the Queen of affections, Eloquence, must
borrow her own pencill and colors: nor may any undertake to expound this text,
and declare the power of this gift here mentioned, but by the gift of this
power. Wherefore as in the interpretation of other inspired Scriptures, we are
humbly to entreat the assistance of the Inspirer, so more especially in the
explication and application of this, which is not only effective a spiritu,
but also objective de spiritu, not only indicted and penned (as all other) by
the spirit, but also of the spirit. This of all other is a most mysterious
text, which being rightly understood, and pressed home, will not only remove
the weaker fence between us and the Greek Church, touching the procession of
the Holy Ghost from the Son; but also beat down and demolish the strong and
high partition wall between the reformed and the Roman Church, built upon S.
Peter's supremacy. For if Christ therefore used the Ceremony of breathing upon
his Apostles, with this form of words, Receive ye the Holy Ghost, as it were
of set purpose, visibly to represent the proceeding of the holy Spirit from
himself, why should not the Greek Church acknowledge with us, the eternal
emanation of the holy Ghost from the Son as well as the Father? and
acknowledging it, join with us in the fellowship of the same spirit? Our
difference and contestation with the Church of Rome in point of S. Peter's
primacy, is far greater I confess. For the head of all controversies between
us and them, is the controversy concerning the head of the Church. Yet even
this, how involved soever they make it, may be resolved by this text alone. For
if Christ sent all his Apostles, as his Father sent him, if he breathed
indifferently upon all, if he gave his spirit, and with it full power of
remittting and retaining sins to them all, then is there no ground here for
S. Peter's jurisdiction over the rest, much less the Popes: and if none here,
none elsewhere, as the sequel will show. For howsoever Cajetan and Heart, and
some few Papists, by jingling Saint Peter's Mat. 16.19.

go about to confound the harmony of the Evangelists, who set all the same
tune, but to a different key: yet this is confessed on all sides by the
Fathers, Hilary, Jerome, Austine, Anselme; and by the Schoolmen, Lumbard,

bunch of keys is offered to all the Apostles, and all of them receive them,
all are joined with S. Peter as well in the mission (as my Father sent me, so
I send you) as in the Commission.

Lastly, as this text contains a sovereign Antidote against the infection of
later heresies, so also against the poison of the more ancient and farther
spread impieties of Arrius and Macedonius, whereof the one denied the divinity
and eternity of the Son, the other of the holy Ghost, both whose damnable
assertions are confuted by consequence from this text. For if Christ by
breathing gives the holy Ghost, and by giving the holy Ghost power of
remitting sin, then must Christ needs be God; for who but God can give or
send a divine person? The holy Ghost also from hence is proved to be God, for
who can Mar. 2.7. or Esaias 43.25.
forgive sins but God alone?

So much is our faith indebted to this Scripture; yet our calling is much more:
for what can be spoken more honorably of the sacred function of Bishops and
Priests, than that the investiture and admittance into it, is the receiving of
the holy Ghost? Primum in unoquoque genere, est mensura and regula caeterorum.
The first action in every kind of this nature, is a president to all the rest,
as all the furniture of the Ceremonial law was made according to the first
pattern in the Mount, such is this consecration in my text, the original and
pattern of all other, wherein these particulars invite your religious
attention: 1 The person consecrating, Christ the chief Bishop of our souls. 2
The persons consecrated, The Apostles the prime Pastors of the Church. 3 The
holy action it self, set forth 1 With a mysterious rite, he breathed on them:
2 A sanctified form of words, receive ye the holy Ghost.



1 First, for the person consecrating. All Bishops are consecrated by him
originally, to whom they are consecrated: all Priests are ordained by him to
whom they are ordained Priests; the power which they are to employ for him,
they receive from him, to whom Matthew. 28.18.
all power is given both in heaven and in earth. By virtue of which deed of
gift, he makes Matthew. 10.2.
choice of his ministers, and he sends them with authority, J^h. 20.21.
as my Father sent me, so I send you: And he furnishes them with gifts,
saying, receive ye the holy Ghost; and enableth them with a double power; of
order, to Matthew. 28.19. Teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost. and 1 Cor. 11.24. This do in
the remembrance of me.
preach and administer both the sacraments; and of jurisdiction also ( Matthew.
18.18.) Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shallbe loosed in
heaven. And that this sacred order is to continue in the Church, and this
spiritual power in this order, even till Christ resigneth up his keys and
kingdom to God his Father, S. Paul assures us ( Ephesians. 4.10.11.12.) He that
descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he
might fill all things, and he gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some
Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for
the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Ver. 12.
Till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fullness of
Christ. Till all the Elect be come God cease not to call by the ministry of
the word, and none may call without a calling to call. Needs must there be
therefore a settled order in the Church, for the calling of those to the
ministry of the word and sacraments, who are to call others by their
ministry. This constant ordination of a succession in the Church, some make a
royalty of Christ, or an appendant to his princely function; for it is for
Kings to set men in authority under them in the affairs of the Kingdom.
Others annexe it to his priesthood, because the high Priest was to consecrate
inferior Priests. A third sort will have it a branch of his prophetical
office, because Prophets were to anoint Prophets. All these reasons are
concludent, but none of them excludent. For the entire truth, in which these
three opinions have an equal share is, that the establishing the ministry of
the Gospel, and furnishing the Church with able Pastors, has a dependence on
all three offices: 1 On the Kingly, in respect of heavenly power. 2 On the
Priestly, in respect of sacred order. 3 On the Prophetical, in respect of
ministerial gifts.
Each of Christ's offices deliver into our hands as it were a key: 1. Clavem
Coeli. 2. Clavem Sanctuarii, or Templi. 3. Clavem sacrae Scripturae.
1. His Kingly office conferreth on us the key of heaven, to open and shut it.
2. His Priestly, the key of the Temple, to enter into it and administer holy
things. 3. His Prophetical, the key of holy Scripture, to open the meaning
thereof.


Thus you see ordinem ordinis, an order for holy orders; you hear who is the
founder of our religious order, and whose keys we keep. Which consideration,
as it much improveth the dignity of our calling, so it reproves their
indignity who walk not agreeable thereunto. A scar in the face is a greater
deformity than a wound or sore in any other part of the body: such is the
eminency of our calling, beloved brethren, that our spots can no more be hid
than the spots in the Moon: nay, that it makes every spot in us a stain,
every blemish a scar, every prick a wound, every drop of Ink a blot, every
trip a fall, every fault a crime. If we defile Christ's priesthood with an
impure life, we do worse than those his professed enemies who spit on his face.
If we foul and black with giving and receiving the wages of unrighteousnes
those hands wherewith we deliver the price of man's redemption in the blessed
Sacraments, we more wrong our Savior than those who pierced his sacred hands
with nails. If we in these holy Mounts of God, wherein we should press the
purest liquor out of the grapes of the Vines of Engaddi, vent our own spleen
and malice; what do we else than offer to Christ again vinegar and gall? If
we Christ's meniall and domestical servants turn Romans 12.11.
(...) into (...), as some copies mis-read, and serve the time instead of
serving the Lord. If we preach our selves, and not Christ crucified; if we
bear the world in hand to woo for our master, but indeed speak for our
selves; if we use the stairs of the Pulpit as steps only to our preferment; if
we hear our Lord and Master highly dishonored, and dissemble it; if we see
the Sea of Rome continually to eat into the banks of our Church, and never go
about to make up the breaches; if that should ever fall out which a sweet
sounding Cymball sometimes tinckled into the ears of the Pope, that Bernard.
de considerat. ad Eugen. Multi necessarii, multi adversarii, non Doctores, sed
Seductores; non Praelati, sed Pilati.
the greatest enemies of Christ should be those of his own house; if Pastors
turn Impostours, if Doctors Seductours, if Prelates Pilates, if Ministers of
Christ servants of Antichrist, either by silence to give way, or by smoothing
Romish tenets to make way for Popery; no marvel then if judgment begin at
the house of God, as it did in the siege at Jerusalem with the slaughter of
Ananus the high Priest: no marvel if God suffer sacrilege to rob the Church
of her maintenance almost in all places, when the Church her self is guilty of
worse sacrilege, by robbing God of his worship and service. But on the
contrary, if as Ambassadors for Christ, we deliver our message faithfully and
roundly; if we seek not our own, but the things that are Jesus Christ's; if we
esteem not our preferments, no nor our lives dear unto us in comparison of
our Masters honor; if we preach Christ crucified in our lives, as well as in
our sermons; if in our good name we are the sweet smelling favor of God, as
well as in our doctrine, we may then, Christi nomine, in Christ's stead
challenge audience, yea, and reverence too from the greatest powers upon earth,
(whatsoever State-flies buzze to the contrary.) For as he that Luke 10.16.
despises Christ's ministers despises him, so he that Mat. 10.40.
receives him receives them also. No man who honors the Prince can
dis-esteeme his Ambassadors. If Scribes and Pharisees must be heard because
they teach in Moses chair, how much more, Says St. Chrysostom, may they
command our attention who sit in Christ's chair? The same Apostle who charge
every soul to be Romans 13.1.4.
subject to the higher powers, who bear not the sword in vain, as strictly
requires the faithful to Heb. 13.17.
obey them that have the rule over them in the Lord, and submit unto them: for
they watch, says he, for your souls, as they that must give account, that
they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for
you. Therefore Sym. epist. ad Anast. Defer Deo in nobis, nos Deo in te.
Symmachus kept within compass, when he thus spoke to Anastasius the Emperor;
Acknowledge God in us, and we will acknowledge him in thee. Deus est in utroque
parente, we hold from Christ as you from God, as we submit ourselves to Gods
sword in your hands, so you ought to obey Christ's word in our mouths. And so I
pass from the person consecrating to the persons consecrated.

He breathed on them, and said, receive ye the holy Ghost.

The holy Martyr St. Cypr. de unita. Eccles. Apostolis omnibus post
resurrectionem suam parem potestatem tribuit, and dicit, sicut misit me pater
and ego mitto vos, accipite Spiritum sanctum: si cui remiseritis peccata,
remittentur ei etc. Hoc e^antutique caeteri Apostoli quod fuit Petrus; pari
consortio praediti, and honoris, and potestatis.
Cyprian makes an inference from these words, for which the Popes have looked
awry upon him ever since. The inference is this; Christ after his resurrection
gave all his Apostles equal power, saying, as my father sent me, so I send
you, receive ye the holy Ghost: whose sins ye remit, they are remitted. Here
lest any addicted to the Papacy might thrust upon the Martyrs words this
meaning, that Christ gave all the Apostles equal authority among themselves,
but not equal to Peter their head, he adds, the rest of the Apostles were
the same that Peter was, admitted into an equal fellowship both of honor and
power. Mark I beseech you, the Martyr speaks here not of a privilege or
singularity, but a society, (consortio;) not a superiority, but a parity,
(pari;) and this parity both in honor, (honoris;) and of power also,
(potestatis:) where there is a parity in honor there can be no preheminencie;
where there is a parity in power there can be no supremacy. Where then will our
Adversaries fasten? Upon those words of Christ, Mat. 16.18.
Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church? St. Austin beats
them off this hold, expounding the rock of Christ, not of Peter, thus, Upon me
I August. in haec verba, Super me aedificabo te, non super te aedificabo me.
will build thee, not me upon thee. Yet if we should leave it them, the
building upon Peter, or laying him in the foundation of the Church, will no
more make him the supreme head of the Church than the rest of the Apostles; for
we read of Apoc. 21.14. And the wall of the City had 12. foundations, and in
them the names of the 12. Apostles of the Lamb. and
twelve foundations upon which the heavenly Jerusalem is built, on which the
names of the twelve Apostles were engraven, and of more also: now therefore,
says he, ye are no more strangers and forreiners, but fellow Citizens with the
Saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the
Apostles and E^hes. 2.^0. Of more.
Prophets. From whence Saint Jer adver. Lucifer. Super omnes ex aequo Ecclesiae
fortitudo solidatur.
Jerome infers, that the strength of the Church is solidly founded, and
equally built upon all the Apostles.

Will they fasten upon the promise made to Peter, (Mat. 16.19.) whatsoever thou
shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: these words might carry some
show of a privilege granted to S. Peter, if S. Matthew, and the other Apostles
were not joined in Patent with him; Mat. 18.18.
whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and Joh. 20.23.
whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them. The last refuge to
which our adversaries fly, is that text, Joh. 21.15.
Feed my lambs, feed my sheep. Which charge of our Saviors makes nothing for
Peter's supremacy, Peter himself being Interpreter; for what Christ gives him
he gives all Elders in charge, Pet. 5.2.
Feed the flock of God which is among you. If feed my sheep make Peter an
oecumenicall Pastor, then feed the flock of Christ, spoken in like manner to
all Elders makes them oecumenicall Pastors. If the word (pasce) when it is
spoken to Peter signifies rule as a Monarch, then (pascite) feed ye, spoken
by S. Peter to Elders must likewise be interpreted, rule ye over the Flock
of God, and Church of Christ as Monarchs. For as Cic. orat. pro Cecinna.
Nunquam obtinebis ubi tu volueris verba interdicti valere oportere, ubi tu
nolueris non oportere.
Tully spoke to Ebutius, so may I say to Bellarmine, you shall never persuade
any man of understanding that words must signify what you will have them, and
conclude nothing but what you will infer from them; that the word pasce or
feed, when it serves your purpose must be taken for to bear rule over the
whole Church; and when it serves not, then it must signify nothing but teach,
as every Pastor does. Had the Apostles so understood the words of our Savior
to Saint Peter, Upon this rock will I build my house, and, To thee I will give
the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, as the Church of Rome at this day does,
(viz.) I will appoint thee Head of all the Apostles, and visible Monarch of the
Church, and infallible Judge of all controversies; they would never have
contended, as they did afterward, Luke 20.24.
which of them should be counted greatest; they would never have taken upon
them to send him Act. 8.14. Now when the Apostles which were at Jerusalem heard
that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.
with John. It is not the manner of Subjects to send their Sovereigns in
Embassages or messages, much less join any other of their Subjects in equal
commission with them, as the Apostles do John with Peter. Had the Church in
the Apostles time understood that our Savior by that charge, Pasce oves meas,
Feed my sheep, made Peter universal Pastor of the whole world; and by his
prayer for him, that his Faith might not fail privileged him from all
possibility of error; they would have rested upon his resolution in the first
Act. 15.11.
Synod. Saint James would never have presumed to speak after him in the great
point which was then in controversy; nor have added a distinct Head or Canon
of his own, That the Gentiles should abstain from pollution of Idols, and
from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. The Apostolical
letter should have been indorsed, not as it was, The Apostles, and Elders, and
Brethren, but, Peter, Christ's Vicar, and Monarch of the Church, and the
Apostles his Counselors; or after the like manner. Had Saint Paul believed
Saint Peter to be Head of the Church, he would never have Gal. 2.11.
withstood him to the face, as he did at Antioch, much less have stood upon
even terms with him as he does, saying, 2 Cor. 12.11.
In nothing am I behind the very chiefest Apostles: and, Gal. 2.6.
they who seemed to be pillars added nothing to me: and ver. 7. the Gospel of
the uncircumcision was committed to me, as the Gospel of the circumcision was
to Peter. If any man's eyes are so dazeled with the luster of the Popes triple
Crown, that he cannot see Paul's equality to Peter in the letter of the text;
yet he cannot but see it in the Fathers Commentaries. Ambros. in comment. 2
Cor. 12. Hoc dicit quia non est minor neque in praedicatione, neque in signis
faciendis, nec dignitate, sed tempore. Chry. in 2 Cor. 12.11. (...).
The Apostle speaks on this wise, says Saint Ambrose, that or because, he is
not inferior to the chief Apostles, neither in preaching, nor in working
miracles, nor in dignity, but in time. Saint Chrysostom acutely observes,
that the Apostle redoubleth his forces, and not content with that he had said
before in 2 Cor. 11.5. I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest
Apostles; he adds in the Chapter following with more confidence and
authority, In nothing am I behind the very chiefest Apostles, though I be
nothing. What? not inferior to Saint Peter? no not Saint Peter (for so it
follows in Saint Chrysostom) he shows himself to be equal in dignity to
the rest; and he Chrysostom. in Gal. 2. v. 8. (...).
compares himself not to other of the Apostles but to the chief, showing
that he was of equal rank with him. See, says Occumen. in Gal. 2. (...).
Oecumenius, how he equalizeth himself to Peter, or sets himself upon even
ground with him. These were Fathers of the Greek Church: what will our
adversaries say if Leo sermon. de laud. Petri and Pauli. De quorum meritis and
virtutibus quae omnem supera^t dicendi facultatem, nihil diversum sentire
debemus, nihil discretum, quos and electio pares, and labor similes, and mors
fecit aequales.
Leo Bishop of Rome, who extolled Peter above the skies, and admits him
after a sort into the fellowship of the individual Trinity, yet makes Saint
Paul his match, saying, Let no man cast a golden apple of contention between
these glorious instruments of Christ's Gospel Peter and Paul, of whose merits
and virtues, which exceed all faculties of speech, or can never be
sufficiently commended, we ought to think nothing diverse, or put no
difference at all in any respect between them; whose calling to the
Apostleship made them equal, and their travel in their office like, and their
martyrdom parallel? Saint Paul then in Leo his judgment may go everywhere
hand in hand with Peter; and in very deed he has the hand of him in the Popes
seal, which puts Bellarmine to much trouble, and great fear, lest Saint
Paul should be taken to be the better man of the two, because in the Popes
seal, which confirms all his Bulls, and unerring Decrees ex cathedra, Saint
Paul has the right hand, and Saint Peter the left. But he may set his heart
at rest, for no Protestant goes about to set Saint Peter below Saint Paul, or
any other Apostle: all that we contend for among the Apostles is but for a
parity: a parity there may be in the Apostolical power and function, and yet
Peter have some preheminency in respect of his years or gifts; such a primacy
may be granted him without any power or jurisdiction over the rest: some power
he might have over the rest, and be a kind of President in the Apostles
College, yet not Christ's Vicar general, or Head of the whole Church: Head he
might be of the Church in some sense, yet his Headship, as his Apostleship,
dye with him, and not descend upon his successors: descend it might upon his
successors, to wit, upon his undoubted successors in Antiochia, and not be
appropriated to his questionable successors at Rome: lastly, it might be after
a sort entayled to his successors at Rome, yet with a qualification, to all his
lawful successors, not to usurpers: to men, as Linus; not to women, as Pope
Joane; to Catholics, as Saint Gregory and Damasus, and all the Popes for 300.
years; not Heretics, as Liberius and Honorius, and many of the latter: to
such as entered canonically, as Cornelius and Stephanus, and the ancient Popes
generally; not such as thrust themselves into that See, and purchased the
Papacy either by art Magic, as Sylvester the second; or by an imposture as
Hildebrand; or simony and faction, as almost all since. Lastly, upon
Apostolical men in life and doctrine, not apostaticall or apotacticall, as
those fifty Popes reckoned by Genebrard (his Holinesses Chronicler) one after
another. By all which particulars seriously considered, Urban his supremacy
derived from Saint Peter, appears to be a rope of sand, or a castle of
Table-men piled one upon another without any thing to hold them together, which
fall allasunder with a fillep; or an old ruinous pair of stairs, the
groundcell or foot whereof, viz. Peter's superiority to the rest of the
Apostles, is not sure, and all the consequences deduced from thence, like
stairs built upon it, are all rotten: and therefore I will stand no longer
upon them, but leap into my third and last part, The manner of the Apostles
consecration: and first of the mysterious rite,

He breathed. The truth and substance Christ himself, who put an end to all
legal shadows, commanding all to worship God in Spirit and truth, ordained
notwithstanding mysterious rites in the Sacraments of the new Testament, and
used visible and significant gestures in his miraculous cures: he gave sight to
the blind, not without touching the eye; and hearing to the deaf, not without
thrusting his finger into the ear; and speech to the dumb, not without wetting
the tongue: he fetched not Lazarus breath back again, without fetching a deep
sigh; nor inspired his Disciples with the holy Ghost, without breathing upon
them. Gestures Cic. de orat. l. 3. Gestus est sermo quidam corporis.
in religious actions are as significant, and more moving than words. Decent
Ceremonies in the substantial worship of God are like shadowing in a picture,
which if it be too much (as we see in the Church of Rome) it darkeneth the
picture, and obscureth the face of devotion; but if convenient, and in fit
places, it gives grace and beauty to it. Superstition may be, and is as
properly in such, who put Religion in not using, as in those who put Religion
in using things in their own nature merely indifferent. Christian liberty is
indifferently abridged by both these errors about things indifferent. And as a
man may be proud even of the hatred of pride, and contempt of greatness; so he
may be superstitious in a causlesse fear, and heady declining of that which
seems, but is not superstitious. Which is the case of some refined Reformers
(as they would be thought) who according to their name of Precisians, ungues
ad vivum resecant, pare the nails of pretended Romish rites in our Church so
near, that they make her fingers bleed. For fear of monuments of Idolatry,
all ornaments of the Church (if they might have their will) should be taken
away: for fear of praying for the dead, they will not allow any prayer to be
said for the living at the burial of the dead: for fear of bread-worship,
they will not kneel at the Communion: for fear of invocating the Saints
deceased, they will not brook any speech of the deceased in a funeral Sermon:
for fear of making matrimony a Sacrament, they will have it no sacred rite,
but a mere civil joining the parties contracted in the congregation, not by
the hand of the Ministers of God, but by the hand of their lay Elders or
Borgomasters: for fear of overlaying the Queens vesture with rich laces of
ceremonies, they rip them off all, cut off the fringe, and pare off the nappe
also. But because the Spouse of Christ (as things now stand) is more afraid of
losing her coat than of her lace or fringe, I leave these men, as unworthy upon
whom more breath should be spent; and come to the particular rite or ceremony
of breathing used by our Savior.

He breathed on them. Here every Interpreter abounds in his own sense:
Barrad. in Evang. Flatus domini potestatem quam dabat remittendi peccata
adumbrabat; ut enim flatu nubes to^o aere pelluntur, sic flatu domini, id est,
Spiritu sancto peccatorum nubes disperguntur; juxta illud Esa. 44. delevisti ut
nubes iniquitates nostras.
Barradius his sense is, that this breathing shadowed forth the ghostly power
of remitting of sins, which Christ gave to his Apostles. For as by a blast of
wind clouds are driven out of the air; so by the blast of God, that is the
holy Spirit, the clouds of our sins are dispersed; according to the words of
the Prophet Esaias, cap. 44.22. I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy
transgressions. Maldonat. in Johan. Christus per insufflationem declarare
voluitipsam Spiritus sancti naturam, est enim veluti flatus patris and filii.
Maldonate his sense is, that Christ by this visible ceremony of breathing
declared the nature of the holy Ghost, who is the breath of the Father and the
Sun. Musculus in Johan. Commode Spiritum per flatum dedit, cum illis muneris
Apostolici potestatem daret, pendebat enim illa a verbis oris ipsius.
Musculus his sense is, that Christ fitly used the ceremony of breathing, when
he invested the Apostles into their function, because it has a dependence upon
the words of his mouth; because it is a power of the word, it was therefore
given by breathing on them. Calvin. harm. Cumarcana inspiratione posset
Christus gratiam confer Apostolis, visibilem flatum addere voluit ad eos
melins confirmandos: symbolum autem sumpsit a vulgari S.S. more qui Spiritum
confert vento.
Calvin his sense is, that Christ added this ceremony of outward breathing upon
them, to confirm their faith in the inward inspiration: the symbol or sign
he took from the common custom of the Scripture, which compares the spirit
to wind. Athana. in Joh. In sufflando dedit animam quae est principium vitae
naturalis, and Spiritum qui est principium vitae spiritualis, ut idem
quicreator agnosceretur renovator.
Athanasius his sense is, that as God in the creation of man breathed into him
his soul, which is the beginning or principle of the natural life; so Christ
here breathed into the Disciples his spirit, which is the beginning or
principle of the spiritual life; that we might know that the same God who is
the author of the natural life, is also the author of the life of grace; and
that he who first created the spirit of man, renews all the faithful in the
spirit of their minds. But the most natural, genuine, and generally approved
reason and interpretation of this rite and ceremony is that which is given by
Saint Austine and Saint Cyrill (viz.) that Christ by breathing on his Apostles,
when he gave them the holy Ghost, signified that the person of the holy Ghost
proceeded from him, as that breath came out of his mouth. For although
Theophylact infected with the present error of the Greek Church, jeareth at
this interpretation, yet neither does he, nor can he give so apt and fit a
one: and in this regard Cardinal Bellarmine justly takes him up for
sleighting the judgment of two of the greatest pillars of the Church. Verily,
says he, Theophylact is to be jeared at by all of the Latin Church, if he
flout at Saint Austine: and of the Greek Church also if he flout at Saint
Cyril: for what interpretation so natural, what reason so proper can be given
of coupling this ceremony with the words, Receive ye the Holy Ghost? that is
giving the holy Ghost by breathing, as this, that the holy Spirit proceeds
from his person. And so I pass from the mysterious rite of breathing, to the
sanctified form of words.

Receive ye the holy Ghost. Not the person nor the substance of the holy
Ghost; for that error the Master of the sentences was long ago whipped by his
scholars. Sanctified the Apostles were by receiving the Spirit, but not
deified. What then received they at this time? some gift of the holy Ghost?
that takes not away the doubt but makes it; untieth not the knot but fasteneth
it rather. For as Pythagoras, when the question of marriage was put to him in
his flourishing age, answered, (...) not yet; when in his decaying and
withering age, he replied, (...) not now: so if the question be of the
ordinary gifts of the holy Ghost, it may be said, (...), the Apostles were not
now to receive them, because at their first calling they were seasoned with
that heavenly liquor. But if the question be of the extraordinary gifts of the
holy Ghost, or a fuller measure of the ordinary, it may be replied, (...), they
were not as yet to receive them. For Christ Joh. 16.7.
must first ascend before he send the holy Ghost. To take this pearl out of
the eye of my text, many medicines have been applied. Theodoret thus offers
to remove it, Our Savior (Joh. 16.7.) said not that he would not give the
holy Ghost before his ascension, but that he would not send him before; at this
time (says that Father) Christ gave the holy Ghost secretly, with grace; but
then he sent him in a visible shape with power. Calvin in Joh. Sic datus fuit
Apostolis spiritus hoc loco, ut respersi fuerint duntaxat ejus gratia, non
plena virtute imbuti.
Calvin helps it with a distinction of the receiving the holy Ghost in
different degrees; now the Spirit was but sprinkled, as it were, upon them; but
in the day of Pentecost it was powered out on them: now they were gently
breathed on, and refreshed as it were with a small gale; then they were all
blown upon, as it were with a mighty wind. Chrysostom. in Joh. (...).
Saint Chrysostom thus expedites the difficulty; some say that Christ gave not
the holy Ghost at this time, but that by his breathing on his Apostles, he made
them capable, or fit to receive him; but we may safely go farther, and say,
that the Apostles at this time received some spiritual grace or power, not of
working wonders, but of remitting sin. If you further ask, why the power of
forgiving sins; or, which comes all to one, why remission of sins is
peculiarly attributed to the Spirit, and by a metonymie termed the Holy Ghost:
Barradius brings us an answer out of the schools, that Barrad. in harmon.
Evang.
remission of sins is a work of Gods goodness and mercy; now works of
goodness are peculiarly attributed to the holy Spirit, who proceeds (as they
determine) from the will of the Father and the Son, whose object is
goodness; as works of wisdom are attributed to the Son, because he is
the word, proceeding by way of generation from the understanding of his Father.
This reason may go for current in their way; neither have I any purpose at
this time to cross it, but to haste to the period of this discourse: in which
that I may better discover the path of truth, in stead of many little lights
which others have brought, I will set up one great taper made of the sweetest
of their wax.

The Holy Ghost is sometimes taken for the person of the Comforter, which
seals Gods chosen to salvation: sometimes for the gifts, effects, or
operations of the Holy Ghost, as it were, the prints of his scale left in the
soul: these are principally three; 1 (...), Grace. 2 (...), spiritual power
or authority. 3 (...), Virtue, or ghostly ability to work wonders, and speak
with diverse languages.
1 Is common to all them that are sanctified. 2 Is peculiar to Christ's
Ministers. 3 Restrained to the Apostles themselves, and some few others of
their immediate successors.
Joh. 3.5. Exce^t a man be borne of the water and of the spirit --
1 Regenerating grace is termed the holyGhost. 2 Spiritual order, or
ministerial power is called the Spirit or holy Ghost in this place, and Luke
4.18. and Esaias 61.1. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the Gospel,
etc. 3 Miraculous virtue is called the holy Ghost, Act. 2.4. And they were
filled with the holy Ghost, and spoke with diverse tongues.
1 The Spirit of grace and regeneration the Apostles received at their first
calling. 2 The Spirit of ecclesiastical government they received at this time,
etc. 3 The Spirit of powerful and extraordinary operation they received in the
day of Pentecost.
1 In their minds by infallible inspiration. 2 In their tongues by
multiplicity of languages. 3 In their hands by miraculous cures.


Receive then the Holy Ghost, is 1 A ghostly function to ordain Pastors, and
sanctify congregations to God. 2 Spiritual gifts to execute and discharge
that function. 3 Spiritual power or jurisdiction to countenance and support
both your function and gifts.


Thus have I opened the treasury of this Scripture, out of which I now offer to
your religious thoughts and affections these ensuing observations. And first in
general I commend to the fervor of your zeal and devotion, the excessive
heat of Christ's love, which absumed and spent him all for us, flesh and spirit.
His flesh he offers us in the Sacrament of his Supper: his spirit he
conferreth in the sacred rite of consecration. His body he gave by those
words, Take, eat, this is my body: his spirit he gave by these, Receive ye
the holy Ghost; a gift unestimable, a treasure unvaluable: for it was this
spirit which quickened us when we were dead in trespasses and sins, it is
this spirit which fetches us again when we swoune in despair, it is this
spirit that refreshes and cools us in the extreme heat of all persecutions,
afflictions, sorrows, and diseases; to it we owe, 1 Light in our minds. 2
Warmth in our desires. 3 Temper in our affections. 4 Grace in our wills. 5 Peace
in our consciences. 6 Joy in our hearts, and unspeakeable comfort in life and
death.


This is the wind which blows Cant. 4.16. Blow upon my garden, that the
spices thereof may flow out: let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his
pleasant fruits.
upon the Spouse her garden, that the spices thereof might flow out. This is
the breath which forms the words in the cloven tongues: this is the breath
which blows and opens all the flowers of Paradise. This is the blast which
diffuseth the savor of life through the whole Church. This is the gale which
carries us through all the troublesome waves of this world, and brings us
safe to the haven where we would be.

And as the Spouse of Christ, which is his mystical body, is infinitely
indebted to her head for this gift of the spirit, whereby holy congregations
are furnished with Pastors, and they with gifts, and the ministry of the
Gospel continually propagated; so we above all nations in the world at this
day are most bound to extol and magnify his goodness toward us herein:
among whom in a manner alone, this holy seed of the Church remains unmixed
and incorrupt; not only as propagated but propagating also, not children only
but Fathers. Apostolical doctrine other reformed Churches maintain; but do
they retain also Apostolical discipline? laying of hands they have on
Ministers and Pastors, but consecration of Archbishops and Bishops they have
not. And because they want consecrated Bishops to ordain Pastors, their very
ordination is not according to ancient order. Because they want spiritual
Fathers in Christ to beget children in their ministry, their Ministers by the
adversary are accounted no better than filii populi; whereas will they nill
they, even in regard of our Hierarchy, the most frontlesse Papists must
confess the children begot by our reverend Fathers in the ministry of the
Gospel, to be as legitimate as their own. For albeit they put the heretic
upon us, as the Arrians did upon the Catholic Fathers, calling them
Athanasians, etc. yet this no way disableth either the consecration of our
Bishops, nor the ordination of our Priests; not only because we have proved
the dog lies at their doors, and that they are a kind of mungrils of
diverse sorts of heretics: but because it is the doctrine of their Church, See
Croy in his third conformity. Whitaker in fine resp. ad demonstrat. Sanderi.
Rivet, procem. de haeref. q. 1. Cath. orthod.
that the character of order is indeleble; and therefore Archbishop Cranmer,
and other of our Bishops ordained by them, if they had afterward (as Papists
most falsely suppose) fallen into heresy, could not lose their faculty of
consecration and ordination. The consecration of Catholic Bishops by Arrians,
and baptism of faithful Christians children by Donatists, though heretics,
is made good, as well by the decrees of ancient as later Councels, determining
that Sacraments administered even by heretics, (so they observe the rite, and
form of words prescribed in holy scripture) be of force and validity. Praised
therefore for ever be the good will of him that dwelt in the bush, that the
Rod of Aaron still flourishes among us, and planteth and propagateth it self,
like that Indian fig tree so much admired by all Travelers, from the utmost
branch whereof issues a gummy juice, which hangs down like a cord or finew,
and within a few months reaches the ground, which it no sooner touches than
it takes root and makes it self a tree, and that likewise another, and that
likewise a third, and so forward till they over-runne the whole grove.

To draw nearer to you my Lord to be consecrated, and so to an end. This
scripture is part of the Gospel appointed for the Sunday after Easter, known
to the Latin Church by the name of Dominica in albis. Which Lords day, though
in the slower motion of time in our Calendar, is not yet come; yet according to
exact computation, this Sunday is Dominica in albis; and if you either respect
the reverend presence Candidantium, or Candidandi, or the sacred order of
Investiture now to be performed, let your eyes be judges whether it may not
truly be termed Dominica in albis, a Sunday in whites. The text it self, as
before in the retexture thereof I showed, is the prototypon or original of all
consecrations, properly so called. For howsoever these words may be used, and
are also in the ordination of Priests, because they also receive the holy
Ghost, that is, spiritual power and authority; yet they receive it not so
amply and fully, nor without some limitation, since ordination and
excommunication have bin ever appropriated and reserved to Bishops. And it is
to be noted, that the Apostles long before this were sent by Christ to preach
and baptize; and therefore they were not now ordained Priests, but consecrated
Bishops, as Saint Greg. in Evan. Horum nunc in ecclesia Episcopi locum tenent
qui gradum regiminis sortiuntur, grandis honor sed grave pondus est istius
honoris.
Gregory says expressly in his illustration of these words, Receive the holy
Ghost: whose sins ye remit, etc. Now Bishops who fit at the stern of the
Church, hold the place of those to whom Christ gave here the ghostly power of
forgiving sins: a great honor indeed, but a great charge withal, and a
heavy burden; so ponderous in Saint Barnards judgment, that it needs the
shoulders of an Angel to bear it. The Apostles had made good proof of their
faithfulness in the ministry of the Word and Sacraments, before Christ lifted
them up to this higher staire; as likewise the venerable Personage now to be
taken up into that rank has done. For more than thirty years he has shined
as a star in the firmament of our Church, and now by the primus motor in our
heaven, is designed to be an Angel (or to speak in the phrase of the
Peripatetickes) an Intelligence to guide the motion of one of our Spheres.
Which though it be one of the least, his Episcopal dignity is no whit
diminished thereby. In Saint Hiero. ad Evag Omnis Episcopus sive Romae, sive
Eugubii aequalis est meriti.
Hieromes account every Bishop, be his Diocese great or small, is equally a
Bishop; Episcopatus non suscipit magis and minus, one Bishop may be richer than
another, or learneder, but he cannot be more a Bishop. Therefore howsoever
Basil. epist. 31. (...).
Nazianzen took it unkindly at Saint Basils hands, after he was advanced to
the Metropolitical See of Cappadocia, and had many good Bishoprics in his
gift, that he put him upon one of the meanest, being ill situated, and of small
revenue; telling him flatly, that he gained nothing by his friendship but this
lesson, not to trust a friend: yet it never troubled great Austine that obscure
Aurelius worked himself into the great and famous Archbishopricke of Carthage,
whilst this eminent light of the Church stuck all his life at poor Hippo:
for he well remembered the words of our Lord and Master, Matthew. 25.21.
Be thou faithful in a little, and I will set thee over much.

Suffer I beseech you a word of exhortation, and but a word. Be faithful to
your Master, seek not your own but the things that are Jesus Christ's. It is
not sufficient in Nazianzens judgment for a Bishop, not to be soyled with the
dust of covetousness, or any other vice; Nazian. orat. 1 de fuga in pont.
Privati quidem hominis vitium esse existimet turpia supplicioque digna
perpetrare, praefecti autem vel antistitis non quam optimum esse.
he must shine in virtue, and if he be not much better than other men, Idem
orat. 20. Antistes improbitatis notam effugere non potest, nisi multum
antecellat.
he is no good Bishop. Wherefore as it was said at the creation of the Roman
Consul, praesta nomen tuum, thou art made Consul, make good thy name, consule
reipublicae: So give me leave in this day of your consecration to use a like
form of words, to you my Lord Elect; Episcopus es, praesta nomen tuum, you are
now to be made a Bishop, an Overseer of the Lords flock, make good your name,
look over your whole Diocese, observe not only the sheep but the Pastors,
not only those that are liable to your authority and jurisdiction, but those
also who execute it under you. Have an eye to your eyes, and hold a strict hand
over your hands, I mean your officials, collectors, and receivers; and if your
eye cause you to offend, pluck it out, and if your hand, cut it off. Let it
never be said by any of your Diocese, that they are the better in health for
your not visiting them; as the Eras. apoth. Eo melius habeo quod te medico non
utor.
Lacedemonian Pausanias answered an unskilful Physician that asked him how he
did, the better (quoth he) because I take none of your Physic. Imprint these
words always in your heart, which give you your indeleble character: consider
whose spirit you receive by imposition of hands, and the Lord give you right
understanding in all things: it is the spirit of Jesus Christ, he breathed, and
said, receive the holy Spirit. This spirit of Jesus Christ is,

1 The spirit of zeal. Joh. 2.17. Be you not cold in Gods cause, whip out
buyers and sellers out of the Church.

2 The spirit of discretion. Joh. 10.14. I am the good shepherd, and know my
sheep, and am known of them. Know them well whom you trust with the mysteries
of salvation, to whom you commit those souls which God has purchased with his
own blood; lay not hands rashly upon any, for if the Matthew. 6.23.
light be darkness how great will the darkness be? If in giving holy
orders, and imposition of hands there be a confusion (hand over head) how great
will the confusion be in the Church?

3 The spirit of meekness. Matthew. 11.29. Learn of me that I am meek, break
not a bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax; sis bonus O foelixque tuis,
be good especially to those of your own calling. Take not Histor. Aug. in
Aureliano.
Aurelian for your pattern, whose soldiers more feared him than the enemy:
but rather Suet. in Tit.
Titus Vespasian, who suffered no man by his good will to go sad from him, and
in this regard was styled, Amor and delicrae humani generis, the love and
darling of mankind. The laity show in their name what they are durum genus;
and how ill they stand affected to us, (...) stone.
and hardly entreat our tribe, all have experience who have or ever had
pastoral charges. We cannot pray them so fast into heaven, as they will
swear us out of our maintenance on earth. And what relief we have at secular
tribunals the world sees; and if we must yet expect harder measure from your
officers and servants, I know not to what more fitly to compare the inferior
of our Clergy, who spend themselves upon their parochial cures, and are
flieced by them whom they feed, and by whom they should be fed, through
vexatious suits in law, than to the poor hare in the Epigram, which to save
her self from the hounds, leaped into the sea, and was devoured by a
sea-dogge: Auson epig.
In me omnis terrae pelagique ruina est.

4 The spirit of humility. Matthew. 20.28. The Son of man came not to be
ministered unto but to minister. The head of the Church vouchsafes Joh. 13.14.
to wash his disciples feet, professing therein ( ver. 15.) that he gave them
an example, that they should do as he had done to them. Wind blown into a
bladder fills it, and into flesh, makes it swell; but the breath of God
inspired into the soul produces the contrary effect: it abateth and takes
down all swelling of pride. Take not Austine the Monk for your pattern, from
whose proud behavior toward them, the British Monks truly concluded, that
he was not sent unto them from Christ; but Saint Austine the Father, whose
modest speech in a contention between him and Jerome, gained him more respect
from all men, than ever the Bishops of Rome got by their swelling bulls, and
direful fulminations. According to the present custom of the Church (says
he) the title of a August. epist. ad Hieron.
Bishop is above that of a Priest, yet Priest Jerome is a better man than
Bishop Austine. As the Bruson facet. and exempl.
Athenians wisely answered Pompey, requiring from them divine honor; We will
so far account thee a God, as thou acknowledgest thy self a man (for
humility of mind in eminency of fortune is a divine perfection): so the less
you account your self a Prelate, the more all men will prefer and most
highly honor you. When Christ consecrated his Apostles Bishops, he breathed on
them, to represent after a sort visibly by an outward symbol, the eternal and
invisible procession of the holy Ghost from his person. In regard of which
divine signification of that his insufflation, no man may presume to imitate
that rite, though they may, and do use the words, Receive the holy Ghost. All
that may be done to supply the defect of that ceremony is in stead of
breathing upon you, to breath out prayers to almighty God for you, that you
right reverend Fathers may give; and for you my Lord Elect, that you may
receive the holy Ghost; for us that we may worthily administer; and for you
that you may worthily participate the blessed body and blood of our Savior;
and for us all, that we may be nourished by his flesh, and quickened by his
spirit, and live in him, and he in us; and dwell in him, and he in us: So be
it, etc.

THE FAITHFUL SHEPHERD. A Sermon preached at the Consecration of three
Bishops, the Lords Elect of Oxford, Bristoll, and Chester, in his Graces
Chapel at Lambeth, May 9. 1619. THE ELEVENTH SERMON.
1 PET. 5.2.3.4. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the
oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but
of a ready mind: not as being Lords over Gods heritage, but being ensamples to
the flock. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a
crown of glory that fades not away.


Most Reverend, Right Honorable, Right Reverend, right Worshipful, etc.
ARchilochus Arist. Rhet. c. 2.
sharpning his quill, and dipping it in gall against Lycambes; that his
satyricall invectives might be more poignant, puts the pen in Archilochus
his Fathers hand, and by an elegant prosopopeia makes him upbraid his son
with those errors and vices, which it was not fit that any but his father
should in such sort rip up. And Orat. pro M. Coelio.
Tully being to read a lecture of gravity and modesty to Clodia, which became
not his years or condition, raises up, as it were, from the grave, her old
grandfather Appius Caecus, and out of his mouth delivers a sage and fatherly
admonition to her. In like manner (right Reverend) receiving the charge from
you to give the charge unto you at this present, and being overruled by
authority to speak something of the eminent authority and sacred dignity into
which ye are now to be invested; I have brought upon this holy stage the first
of your rank, and auncientest of your Apostolical order, to admonish you with
authority both of your general calling, as Pastors set over Christ's flock,
and your special, as Bishops set over the Pastors themselves: That in the
former words, (...), feed; this in the latter, (...), bishoping, or taking the
oversight of them. Both they are to perform, 1 Not by constraint: 2 Not for
lucre. 3 Not with pride.


1 Not by const^ant: constraint stands not with the dignity of the Apostles
successors.

2 Not for filthy lucre: filthy lucre sorts not with Gods Priests.

3 Not in, or with Lord-like pride: Lord-like pride complyeth not with the
humility of Christ's Ministers.

As Tully the aged wrote to Cato the ancient, of old age; so in the words of
my text Peter the Elder writes to Elders, of the calling, life and reward of
Elders in the Church of God. 1 Their function is feeding, and overlooking
Christ's flock, enjoined ver. 2. 2 Their life is to be a pattern of all
virtue, drawn ver. 3. 3 Their reward is a Crown of glory, set before them
ver. 4.
1 Their function sacred, answerable to their calling, which is divine. 2 Their
life exemplary, answerable to their function, which is sacred. 3 Their reward,
exceeding great, answerable to the eminency of the one, and excellency of the
other.


May it please you therefore to observe out of the words, 1 For your
instruction, what your function is. 2 For correction, what your life should be.
3 For comfort, what your reward shall be.


As the costly Exodus 28.14.
ornaments of Aaron were fastened to the Ephod with golden chains of writhen
work, so all the parts and points of the Apostles exhortation are artificially
joined and tied together with excellent coherence, as it were with chains of
gold. This chain thus I draw through them all.

Feed.
1 There are some of the ministry fitter to be fed and led like sheep, than to
feed or lead like shepherds; they are hunger-starved themselves, having no
better provision than the Apostles had in the wilderness after Christ's
miraculous feast, Matthew. 14.20.
a few baskets full of broken meat. Saint Tantae charitatis sunt per quos nobis
fluenta coelestia emanant, ut antea effundere quam effundi velint, loqui quam
audire paratiores, prompti docere quod nunquam didicerunt, Bernard.
Bernard admireth at their charity, saying, they by whom the streams of
heavenly doctrine flow to us, are of such superabundant charity, that they
desire to empty themselves before they are half full, nay many before they
have any drop of saving knowledge, and divine learning, most ready to deliver
that which they never received, and teach what they never learned. Such a one
was that Lactant. divin. instit. l. 5. Cum c^^cus ipse esser, alios illuminare
suscepit in se.
Bithynian whom Lactantius takes up for taking upon him to cure dim and
dark eyes, when himself was stark blind. I find nothing whereunto I may
fitter resemble them, than to squibs or small fireworks, which as soon as
they take fire, never leave popping and shooting, and making a hideous noise,
till all the powder be spent: so these having rammed a little stuff together,
and being kindled with blind zeal, never leave shooting and spitting fire in
the pulpit, as long as their poor provision lasts. These men, howsoever they
are liable to many other exceptions, yet all men will free them from the
imputation which Foelix laid upon Saint Paul, Act. 26.24.
much learning has made thee mad. And as secure are they from the danger of
the killing letter, as the Poet in his witty Epigram plays upon an ignorant
Priest in time of Popery; Tho. Morus in epig.
Tu been cavisti ne te ulla occidere possit
Litera, nam nota est litera nulla tibi.
Thou have taken good care that the killing letter shall not hurt thee, for
thou know never a better in the book. The measures of the Sanctuary
contained twice as much as the common measures, the shekel of the Sanctuary
weighed down two other shekels; to show us that the gifts of a Pastor ought
to carry a double proportion to those of his flock, else he had need to be
fed himself; and is not qualified for this duty required in my text, in the
first place, Feed.

2 Of those that are able to feed, some feed themselves, not their flock; The
flock.
like Varus, taxed by Velleius Paterculus, who came poor into a rich Province,
but went rich out of the poor Province; making a very gainefull exchange, by
leaving them the poverty he brought with him, and taking with him the wealth
he found there. Feed ye not your selves but the Flock.

3 Of those that feed the Flock, some feed not Gods Flock, Of God.
but Satan's heard; teaching in Conventicles of Heretics, or Schismatikes.
Waspes have their hives as well as Bees, and Pirates have their Pilots as well
as honest Merchants: be not ye like them; feed not the droves of Satan or
Antichrist, but the Flock of God.

4 Of those that feed the Flock of God, Among you.
some feed not that Flock which is among them, they are (...), Bishops in
other men's Diocesses; they thrust their sickle into another harvest, and
discharge without a charge: they may rightly say with the Spouse in the
Canticles, Cant. 1.6.
They have made me (or rather I have made my self) a keeper of vineyards, but
mine own vineyard have I not kept. If the frogs of Plin. not. Inst. l. 8.
Ranae mutae sunt etiam nunc in Serypho Insula, eaedem alio translatae canunt,
etc.
Seryphus could speak they would claim kindred of these men; for as those
frogs in the Island where they are bred are dumb, and make no noise at all,
but carried to any other Country, fall on singing or croaking, and never give
over: so these are silent and quiet in their own cures, but when they are out
of them none can be quiet for them: they who can scarce afford a Sermon in a
month at their own home, make nothing of lecturing every day in the week
abroad.

5 Of those that feed the flock of God which is among them, that is, Taking
the oversight thereof.
preach painefully and powerfully, some are not not (...) Overlookers; they
take not the oversight of their flock, they have not an eye to their life and
manners, they never use the reine, or rather curb of ecclesiastical
discipline; forgetting that in the Ark of God, together with the Table of the
Testimony, and the Pot of Manna, the Rod of Aaron that budded was laid up: and
that where Psalm. 23.4.
David compares God to a shepherd, he makes mention both of his rod and
staff.

Not by constraint
6 Of those that feed the flock of God that is amongst them, and take the
oversight thereof, that is, both rule well, and labor in the word, some
deserve not the double honor, because they do it by constraint, not
willingly, like those Calves, and Bullocks, and Rams, that were pulled and
haled to the Altars of the heathen gods, wherewith Plin. l. 8. not. hist. c.
45. Hoc quoque notatum est, vitulos ad aras humeris hominum allatos, non fere
litare, nec aliena hostia placari deos, nec trahente se ab aris.
Pliny observes that the Paynim deities were never pleased, nor gave good
success to them which offered such sacrifice unto them. Nature her self
gives a prerogative to that Plin. not. hist. l. 11. c. 15. In omni melle quod
per se fluit, ut mustum, oleumque quod appellatur acaeton, maxim laudabile
est. Not for filthy incre.
honey which drops out of the comb, before that which is forced or squized
out; and to that Plin. not. hist. l. 12. c. 15. Inciduntur bis, sudant autem
sponte priusquam incidantur stacten dictam.
oil which sweats out of the Myrrh trees, issuing from thence of it own
accord, before that which runs after pricking or incision. The noblest
pallat wine is made of that liquor of the grape which spinneth out upon the
smallest touch, without any violent pressure: Theog. gnom.
(...).

7 Of those that take the oversight of the flock, not by constraint but
willingly, some do it not freely, or of a ready mind, but for filthy lucre.
The Echo taught by Erasmus, rings this in the ears of the Laity, and they
hear it brief, Quid venatur sacerdos? (...). And Plat. in Bon. 3. Re vera
pace bonorum dicam, multi episcopatum desiderant, explendae avaritiae suae
causa, non quo communi utilitati ut eorum exposcit officium and nomen,
consulant: quaeritur enim quantum reddat episcopatus, non quot oves pascuae in
eo sint.
Platina gives a touch hereof in the life of Pope Goodface the third; the
first question is, after a man is chosen Pope, what is the Bishopric of Rome
worth? Filthy lucre carries such an ill favor with it, that the precious
ointment of Aaron cannot take away the smell thereof. Covetousness is a spot
in any coat, but a stain in the linen Ephod: what so unfit? what so
incongruous? nay what so opprobrious and scandalous, as for those who in
scripture are styled Angels, and should like Angels, by continual meditations,
and divine contemplations behold the face of God in heaven, to turn
earth-wormes, and lie and feed upon very mucke? How dare they deliver the holy
Sacrament with those hands that have received bribes? or are defiled with the
price of blood? or are foul with telling their use-money? Holiness (which of
all other most be fitteth our sacred calling) in the greek implies a
contradiction to earthlinesse: (...), which we render holy, is all one in that
language as unearthly. If a glass be soyled with dust, or be^^ ^eared with
dirt, it reflecteth no image at all: in like manner if the mind be soyled
with the dust of earthlinesse, the image of God cannot appear in it; the
fancy of such a man will represent no spiritual form, conceive no divine or
heavenly imaginations. If we seek our own and not the things that are Jesus
Christ's, the goods not the good of our flock, we lose the first letter of our
name in the Prophet Ezekiel. 3.17. Son of man, I have made thee a watchman.
Ezekiel, and of speculatores become peculatores, and are not to be termed
praedicatores but praedatores. But I will not make this blot bigger by
unskilfully going about to take it out.

8 Of those that feed, Not as Lords.
and take the oversight of Gods flock that is among them, not by constraint
but willingly, not for filthy lucre; but of a ready mind, some carry
themselves like Lords over the flock, not as ensamples to their flock, they
go in and out before them in a stately and lordly gate, Council. Carthag 4.
(...). fumosus seculityphus.
(...), in swelling pride, not in exemplary humility, seeking rather to
overruled them with terror and violence, than rule over them with the spirit
of meekness. These though they are put up to the highest form, yet have not
learned the first lesson in the school of Christianity, Matthew. 11.29.
to be meek and lowly in heart: neither understand they that divine graces,
which are the plants of Paradise, are like to the tree in the Poet that bare
golden boughs: Virg. Aen. 6.
-- Quae quantum vertice ad auras
Aethereas tantum, radice in Tartara tendit.
whose root was just so much beneath the earth as the top was in height above
it. The higher Gods Saints grow upwards to perfection, the deeper they take
root downward in humility, considering that they have nothing of their own,
but sin; and what a foolish and impious sin of pride is it, to be proud of
sin? He that presumes on his own strength, says holy Austine, is conquered
before he fight. To repose trust in our selves, says Bern. sermon. 20. in
vigil. not. dom. Sibimet ipsi fidere, non fidei sed perfidiae est, nec
confidentiae sed diffidentiae magis, in semetipso habere fiduciam.
Bernard, is not of faith, but perfidiousnesse, neither breeds it true
confidence, but diffidence. To be proud of knowledge, is to be blind with
light: to be proud of virtue is to poison himself with the Antidote: and to
be proud of authority, is to make his rise his downfall, and his ladder his
ruin. It is the dark foil that gives the Diamond its brightest luster: it
is the humble, and low, and obscure conceit of our own worth that gives
luster and grace to all our virtues and perfections, if we have any: Moses
glory was the greater because his face shined, and he knew not of it.

Thus have I numbered unto you the several linkes of the Apostles golden chain
of instructions for Pastors, now let us gather them together in a narrow room.
1 Be not such as need to be fed, but are able and willing to feed. 2 Feed
not your selves but the flock. 3 Feed not the flock or droves of Antichrist,
but the flock of God. 4 Feed the flock of God, not out of your charge, or
without you, but the flock of God which is among you. 5 Content not your
selves with feeding them only with the Word and Sacrament, but over-looke them
also, have an eye to their manners. 6 Do this not constrainedly, but
willingly. 7 Not out of private respects, but freely. 8 Not proudly but humbly;
not to show your authority over the flock, but to set before them an ensample
in your selves of humility, meekness, temperance, patience, and all other
virtues.


Thus feed the flock of God that is among you, thus rule those whom you
feed, thus carry yourselves toward those whom you rule, thus give good
ensample in your carriage; and when the chief shepherd and Bishop of your
souls Christ Jesus shall appear, you shall receive in stead of a Crosier a
Scepter, of a Miter a Crown, of a Diocese upon earth a Kingdom in heaven.

You see I have a large and plentiful field before me, yet I purpose at this
time to follow the example of the Apostles, Matthew. 12.1.
who as they passed through the corn field, plucked only an ear or two, and
rubbed them in their hands.

To rub the first ear, that you may see what grain it yields. To feed,
says l. 1. de Romans pont. c. 15. In scripturis pascere passim accipitur pro
regere, ut psalm. 2. reges cos in virga ferrea: in Heb. est pasce (...) and
Apoc. 2.27. (...)
Bellarmine, signifies to rule with princely authority, to sway the scepter as
a spiritual Prince over Christ's flock; and to this purpose he alleges that
text in the Apocalypse, 2.27. (...) he shall feed (or rule) them with a rod of
iron: hard feeding for Christ's sheep; he had need to have an Estridge's
stomach that can digest this interpretation here. Feed, not overruling, ver.
3. that is, overruled them, not feeding: this is as natural an interpretation
of this scripture, as the gloss upon the word statuimus in the Canon law, id
est, abrogamus, or statuimus quod non; we enact, that is, we abrogate; we
command, that is, we forbid; we appoint this, that is, we appoint that this
shall not be. If this be a right interpretation of this place, and the other
parallel to it in Saint Joh. 20.17.
John, then Saint Bernard. de considerat. ad Eugen. l. 2. I ergo tu and tibi
usurpare aude aut dominans apostolatum, aut apostolicus dominatum, etc.
Bernard was in the wrong, for he inferres the clean contrary from it: and
which is most considerable, in a book of consideration dedicated to the Pope
himself: Peter could not give thee that which he had not; what he had, that he
gave thee, care over the Churches: but did he not also give thee dominion?
hear what himself says, not as being Lords over Gods heritage but being made
examples to the flock: lest any man should think that this was spoken only
in humility, and not in truth, it is the voice of the Lord in the Gospel,
Kings of the nations bear rule over them, but it shall not be so with you; it
is plain that Lord-like dominion is forbidden to the Apostles: go too
therefore now, and assume to thy self if thou dare, either the office of an
Apostle, if thou be a Lord, or Lord-like Dominion if thou be an Apostle.
Howbeit I deny not that the word (...) here used, sometimes signifies to rule
with Princely authority, and Lord-like command, both in Scriptures and profane
Writers: as Hom. Il. 1.
Homer styles King Agamemnon (...), the Shepherd of the people: so God
himself calls Cyrus his Esaias 44.28. That says of Cyrus, he is my shepherd.
Shepherd; and which is very observable, Cyrus as if he had taken notice of
this name imposed by God upon him before his birth, was wont usually to say,
Xen. Cyr. poed. l. 8. (...).
That a good Prince was like a good Shepherd, who can by no other means grow
rich, than by making his flock to thrive under him; the prosperity of the
subject is not only the honor but the wealth also of the Prince. All this
makes nothing for the Popes triple Crown, to which he lays claim by
virtue of Christ's threefold pasce, or feed (Joh. 21.15.16.17.) for neither
does (...) originally, nor properly, nor usually signify to reign as a King,
especially when oves meae, or grex domini, my sheep, or the flock of God is
construed with it; nor can it be so taken here, or Joh. 21. as the light of
both texts set together reflecting one upon the other will clear the point. For
that which Christ enjoyneth Peter, Joh. 21. that Peter here enjoyneth all
Elders: the words of the charge are the same, Feed my sheep, there; Feed the
flock of God, here. But Saint Peter enjoyneth not all Elders in these words to
rule with sovereign authority as Kings over the whole flock, or as Lords over
their own peculiar: for this he expressly forbids, ver. 3. therefore to
usurp authority over the whole Church, or to domineere over any part thereof,
is not to feed according to Christ's charge to Saint Peter, or Saint Peter's to
all Elders. What is it then? if you have reference to the Etymology (...) is
(...), to feed, as the word imports in the original, is to reside upon our
cure, or abide with our flock, where the spouse is commanded to seek Christ,
Cant. 1.8.
go thy way forth to the footsteps of the flock. And indeed where should the
Sentinel be but upon his watchtower? where the Pilot but at the stern? where
the intelligence but at his orb? where the sun but within his ecliptic
line? where the candle but in the candle-stick? where the diamond but in the
ring? where the shepherd but among his flock? whom he is to feed, for whom
he is to provide, of whom he is to take the oversight, to whom he ought to
be an example; which he cannot be if he never be in their sight. But because
this observation is grounded only upon the Etymology, I will lay no more
stresse upon it. The proper and full signification of the word is pastorem
agere, to play the good shepherd, or exercise the function of a Pastor, which
consists in three things especially: 1 Docendo quid facere debeant. 2 Orando
ut facere possint. 3 Increpando si non faciant.
1 In teaching those of his flock what they ought to do. 2 In praying that
they may do it. 3 In reproving if they do it not.


All which may be reduced to a threefold feeding: 1 With the Word, Jer. 3.
Jer. 3.15. I will give you pastors according to mine own heart, that shall
feed you with knowledge and understanding.
2 With the Sacraments, Apoc. 2. and Joh. 6. 3 With the Rod, Micah 7.14.


To feed with the Word and Sacraments is the common duty of all Pastors, but to
feed with the rod is reserved to Bishops: they are Seraphims, holding the
spiritual sword of excommunication in their hands, to guard the tree of life:
whose special office, and eminent degree in the Church is employed in the word
(...), which the vulgar latin rendereth providentes, but Saint Aug. de civ. l.
19 c. 19. Supervidentes appellantur, ut intelligant se non esse episcopos qui
prae esse dilexerint, non prodesse.
Austine more agreeable to the Etymology, supervidentes, super-visours, or
super-intendents. Yet this is but a general notation of the name; every Bishop
is a super-visour or over-seer, but every super-visour is not a Bishop. The
Lacedaemonian Magistrates were called Ephori, which is an equivalent style to
Episcopi: and Eusebius. vit. Constant (...).
Constantine the great spoke as truly as piously to his Bishops; Ye reverend
Fathers are Bishops of them that are within the Church, but I of them that are
out of the Church: where your pastoral staff is too short, I will piece it
out and lengthen it with my scepter. (...) in the most proper and restreyned
signification, is to exercise Episcopal authority (or perform the office of a
Bishop) which consists in two things: 1 In ordaining. 2 Ordering.
1 Giving orders. 2 Keeping order.


Saint Paul gives Tit. 1.5.
Titus both in charge: for this cause left I thee in Crete, to ordain Elders
in every Church, there is the first, to wit, ordination; and to set in order
things that are wanting, or (...), to correct things out of order, there is the
second, viz. ordering or reformation. Timothy likewise the first consecrated
Bishop of Ephesus is put in mind of these branches of his Episcopal function:
of the first, 1 Timothy 5.22.19
Lay hands suddenly on no man: of the second, Against an Elder receive not an
accusation but under two or three witnesses: ver. 20.
Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. Be not ver. 22.
partaker of any other man's sins, to wit, by not censuring or punishing them.
These two offices to be most necessary in the Church, every man's reason and
common experience will inform us. For how shall we have Ministers at all
without ordination? and how shall we have good Ministers or people without
visitation? Now for Presbyters or Ministers, who are equal in degree to
exercise authority one over the other, and lay hands upon themselves, and so to
become their own ghostly Fathers, is to make order it self a confusion.
Therefore God in the law put a difference between the Priests and Levits: and
Christ in the gospel between the Apostles and Disciples; and the Apostles
after Christ's death between Bishops and Elders. Which the primitive Church kept
so religiously, that to oppose it in practice was accounted no less than Act.
Council. 1. Chalced. (...).
sacrilege; in doctrine, flat heresy. The first that I find ever to have
gone about to break down the partition wall between Bishops and Presbyters,
was Aerius, a man like his name, light and aerie, easily carried away with the
wind of ambition. For as Epiph. haeres. 71. Cum episcopatus spe excidisset
Eustathio posthabitus, ut se consolaretur hanc haeresem excogitavit. (...).
Epiphanius writes, standing for a Bishopric, and missing it, he invented
this heresy to comfort himself; and because he could not raise up himself
to the high rank of Bishops, he sought to pull them down to his lower rank
of Elders. What difference, says he, is there between a Bishop and a Priest?
none at all, their order, and honor, and dignity, is one and the selfsame.
But for this his saucy malepartnesse he felt the smart of the Crosier staff,
and for ranking Bishops among Presbyters or Elders, he was himself ranked among
heretics. God who made greater and lesser lights in the firmament, and set
Angels in ranks one above another, has erected an See King James his Cygnea

Hierarchy upon earth: which as he has ever yet, so I hope he still will to
the end of the world establish and support and propagate it, as it has
wonderfully supported and propagated the Church. The bounds thereof extended by
the preaching, and kept by the government of Bishops; the Heretics and
Schismatics in all ages suppressed by Councels and Synods of Bishops; the
Rubricks of Ecclesiastical Kalendars colored with the blood of so many
martyred Bishops, are sufficient evidence thereof. And as the Church soon
after her first plantation exceedingly prospered under the shade of James
Bishop of Jerusalem, Titus of Crete, Timothy of Ephesus, Mark of Alexandria,
Ignatius of Antioch, Antipas of Pergamus, Polycarpe of Smyrna, and diverse
others ordained by the Apostles, or their immediate successors; and in
succeeding ages received her best sap and nourishment from the Greek and
Latin Fathers, who for the most part were Bishops: so Beza de grad. Min.
evang. cap. 18. Non tantum insignes Dei martyrs, sed etiam praestantissimos
doctores and pastores.
Beza himself acknowledges it to have been the singular happiness of the
Church of England, which he prays may be perpetual, that this reverend and
sacred order has yielded not only famous Martyrs, but also most excellent
Doctors and Pastors. As the Poet blazing the virtues of the Emperor then
reigning, said, Mart. epig. l. 1.
Te volet invictus pro liberate Camillus:
Si Cato reddatur, Caesarianum erit.
Brutus and Camillus and Cato, the greatest sticklers for the liberty of the
commonwealth, if they were now alive would turn Royalists: so we may truly
affirm that the greatest enemies of Episcopal jurisdiction, could not but
approve of such Bishops as now sit at the stern in our Church. And what if all
are not such? must the whole order suffer for their sake? Ovid l. 1. de art.
Desine paucorum diffundere crimen in omnes. lay not upon all the fault of
some. If one or other budde of Aarons rod, the bishopric of Rome and the
dependants thereon, are turned into serpents, shall the whole rod be cast out
of the Arc, and Jonah's gourd put in the place thereof? I mean the new sprung
up mushrome, the government of lay Elders; Elders whereof no elder age of the
Church ever took notice, and the younger cannot tell yet how to christen them:
because they are a kind of epicoens, of both genders, plant-animals, partly
animals, partly plants: like a sort of Nuns at Bruxels, partly regular partly
secular; in the morning wearing the cowles and habit of Recluses, in the
afternoon the feathers and other attire of Gallants. For they are
Clergy-laickes, and Lay-clerkes: of their clergy they are, for they together
with their Ministers ordain Ministers, and inflict ecclesiastical censures;
and yet laickes they are, for they may not preach nor baptize. Churchmen they
are, for they bear rule in the Church; yet churchmen they are not, for they
may receive no maintenance from the Church. They are the Elders that rule well,
and labor, not in the word, for such they will have intimated by S. Paul; yet
the honor which their own Interpreters there expound honorable maintenance,
is not due unto them. Spare me Men, Fathers, and Brethren, if I spare not them
who go about to bereave us of our spiritual Fathers, qui saeviunt in plagas
and vulnera ecclesiae, who seek to ruin the ruins, and spoil the very
spoils of ecclesiastical dignity and distinction left among us. To place such
Bats as these, rather mice than birds, must Christ's Apostles and their
successors be displaced, and all ranks of ecclesiastical order confounded: is
there any justice in this, to break all Crosier staves, and tread all Miters
under foot, and tear all Rochets in pieces Unius ob noxam and furias Ajacis
Oilei. for the usurpations and tyranny of one Bishop the Pope of Rome? By this
reason take away the reverend order of the Apostles for Judas sake, take away
the sacred order of Prophets for Balaams sake, take away the sovereign order
of Princes for Julians sake, take away the glorious orbs of stars for the
stars sake called Apoc. 8.11.
wormwood in the Apocalypse, nay take away the highest regiment of Angels for
Lucifers sake, and the rest of his faction, sometime in the highest order in
heaven, but now reserved in chains of darkness till the great day.

This may suffice to be spoken of, and for your calling: two words of the two
duties employed in the words, (...) and (...), feed, and take the oversight.
You are Pastors and Bishops, make good your titles, feed as Pastors, take the
oversight of your Diocese as Bishops. The three orders in the Church,
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, resemble the three faculties of the soul, the
vegetative, sensitive, and reasonable. For as the sensitive faculty includes
the vegetative, and aliquid amplius and somewhat more, to wit, sense; and the
reasonable implies the sensitive, and aliquid amplius and somewhat more, to
wit, reason; so a Priest implies a Deacon, and aliquid amplius; and a Bishop
implies a Priest, and aliquid amplius. Ye are (my Lords) both Bishops and
Priests, and as you are invested into a double honor, so you have a double
charge: as Bishops you are to rule well; as Priests to labor in the word: as
Priests you are to preach, as Bishops to ordain Priests, and countenance
Preachers: as Priests you are to smite simony and sacrilege, schism and
heresy, impurity and impiety, gladio oris, with the sword of your mouth; as
Bishops, ore gladii, with the mouth, that is, the edge of the sword, the sword
of ecclesiastical censures which Christ has put into your hand: bear not
this sword in vain, be not partakers of the sins of any of the clergy, or
bribes of the laity; use this your sword for, not against the Church: Virg.
Aen. 4.
Non hos quaesitum munus in usus.

Hold not too strict a hand over your too much oppressed Clergy; let it not be
said of the clergy of your Diocese, as it was said of the Roman soldiers
under Severus, that they were more afraid of their Captain than of the enemy.
For as Saint Paul speaks to the Corinthians, if I make you sad who shall
comfort you? so may I say to you, if you dishearten poor Ministers who shall
comfort them, or stand for them? the laity? no, they take too much of the
nature of the stone, from whence they have their name given them, (...)
signifies people, (...) a stone.
(...) from (...): if a faithful minister of Jesus Christ, if a diligent
preacher that spends his oil and week, his body and soul to give them light;
sue but for his dues, especially if he mutter but a word against their great
Diana, their sacrilegious customs, which often deprive the ministers of the
Gospel of nine parts of the Tenth, and leave them but decimam decimae, the
tenth of the tenth; they will all fall upon him, and unless your power and
authority relieve him, grind him to powder. They use their godly Preachers,
whom the world cannot parallel, as the Hawke in Hesiod dealt with the melodious
Nightingale, Hesiod. op. and dies l. 1.
they plume them and devour them, (...), although they be the sweetest
singers of Israel. Many of them after they have spent their strength in
preaching in season and out of season, catechizing and lecturing on the Lords
day, and on the week days, may truly say as Synesius sometimes complained
that they carried nothing away from their parishes or cures, but bonam
conscientiam and malam valetudinem, a good conscience, and an ill and cr^zed
body.

No more of (...), taking the oversight: and but a word of (...), feed, lest
whilst I exhort you to feed, I detain you from better feeding, viz. upon the
blessed Sacrament now set before you. As in Churches and Noble-mens hals, where
there hang great Candlestickes with many branches, the lights are first let
down to be tinded, and when they are fully lighted, then they are drawn up
by degrees to give light to the whole room: so our Church first sends her
sweet wax lights, made and formed in private schools, down to the
Universities to be tinded, and when they are fully enlightened with knowledge,
then draws them up by degrees, first to pastoral charges, then to dignities,
Deaneries, and Bishoprics; not that then they should be put out, but to the
end that as they are set higher they should give more light. You are, right
Reverend, the silver Trumpet of Zion, whom God lifts up on high that you may
sound the louder and shriller, as bells are hung higher in the steeple, that
they may be heard further. Let it be never said of you as it was of Saul,
that when he came to the high places he made an end of prophesying. The more
God has honored you, the more you ought to honor him; the higher Christ has
preferred you, the more you ought to love him, and show this your love by your
treble diligence in feeding his sheep. To which end these words, Peter love
thou me? feed my sheep, etc. are by the order of our Church appointed to be
read for the Gospel at your consecration. I grant you feed many ways; you
feed when you appoint pastors to feed, you feed when you instruct them how to
feed, you feed when you censure them for not feeding their flocks, or not
feeding them with wholesome food, you feed in a Synod when you make good
canons, you feed in your visitations when you encourage good Ministers, and
reform abuses in the Church, lastly, you feed at your tables when you keep
good hospitality. And after all these manners the Apostles and ancient Fathers
fed; yet they thought themselves in danger of a vae, or curse if they fed not
by preaching the Gospel in their own persons. Woe be to me, says Saint 1
Cor. 9.16.
Paul, if I preach not the Gospel. Saint Gregory was a Bishop himself, and
that of a very large and troublesome Diocese (for he was Pope of Rome) yet
he deeply charge Bishops with this duty, thus inferring upon Christ's words
to Peter, love thou me? feed, etc. Greg. in verb. evang. secundum Johan. Si
dilectionis argumentum est cura pastoralis, quisquis virtutibus pollens gregem
Dei renuit pascere, summum pastorem convincitur non amare.
If care and diligence in a pastoral charge be an argument, and certain
evidence of the love we bear to Christ, whosoever furnished with gifts and
abilities thereunto, refuses to feed Christ's flock, is to be taken pro
convicto, that he bears no good affection to the chief Pastor and Bishop of
our souls. If the love of Christ constrained us not to stir up the grace of
God in us, which we have received by imposition of hands, and even like lamps
to spend our selves to give light to our flocks; yet methinkes the excellency
of this function should inflame us thereunto. Where can we fix our thoughts
with more delight and contentment than upon heaven and heavenly objects? how
can we put our tongues to a better use than to declare the word of life? to
preach the Gospel of the Kingdom? to sound out our makers praises? how can
our hands be better employed than about the seals of grace? Hear Saint
Chrysostom. homil. 1. in Matthew. (...), etc.
Chrysostom open his golden mouth, and weigh his words in the scales of the
sanctuary: See thou not, says he, how thine eyes water whilst thou stayest
in the smoke, but are cleared and refreshed if thou go out into the open
air, or walk a turn in a pleasant garden? so the eye of our mind is
cleared, and our spiritual senses much revived by walking in the garden of
holy Scriptures, and smelling to the flowers of Paradise; but if we run about
in the smoke, that is, busy our selves about earthly affairs, we shall shed
many a tear, and be in danger of quite losing our sight.

I will conclude, and briefly represent all the principal points of the
Apostles exhortation to your view in one type of the law. In the Arc of the
covenant there was the rod of Exodus 24.25.
Aaron that budded, and about it a crown of gold. By the rod of Aaron you
easily apprehend the Priests office or pastoral charge: the buds of this rod,
or parts of this charge are two, feeding and overseeing; which ought to be
performed not by constraint, but willingly, as the buddes were not drawn out
of Aarons rod, but put forth of their own accord. And herein we are not to
respect our own good, but the good of our flock: we must do nothing for
filthy lucre, but of a free mind to benefit others, as the rod of Aaron bare
not blossoms or fruit to, or for it self, but to, and for others. By the
fruits of Aarons rod you may understand the good life of a faithful Pastor,
who is to be an example to his flock; this fruit enclineth him to true humility
opposite to Lord-like pride, as the fruit of a tree weighs the branches down
to the earth. Lastly, by the Crown above the rod, and round about the Arc, is
represented the reward of a faithful Shepherd and vigilant Bishop. You have
the emblem of your office, the word or Motto shall be Germinet virga Aaronis,
Let the rod of Aaron blossom in your mouths by preaching the word, and budde
in your hands by the exercise of ecclesiastical discipline, and bear fruit in
your lives by being ensamples to your flock, and the crown above the rod, and
about the Arc shall be yours, as it is promised, ver. 4. And when the chief
shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not
away; Which God the Father grant for the price of his Sons blood, to whom
with the holy Spirit be all honor, glory, praise, and thanksgiving, now and
for ever, Amen.

THE TREE OF SAVING KNOWLEDGE: OR Schola Crucis, Schola Lucis, A Sermon
preached in Lent, March 16. before the King at White Hall. THE TWELFTH SERMON.
1 COR. 2.2. I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ,
and him crucified.


IF any here present be of so dainty ears, and delicate a palate, that
wholesome meat will not down with them, unless it be curiously dressed by
art, and exquisitely dished, and set forth with variety of costly sawces; I
desire them to consider that there may be intemperancy in the ear as well as
the taste, and that to feed such a luxurious humor in them, were a kind of
breach of the holy Fast we now keep. Where beautiful pictures, and sacred
imagery are most in use (I should say abuse) I mean in the Church of Rome,
during the whole time of Lent, sad P. Moul. cont. Coeffet p. 2.
curtains, and dark vailes are drawn before them: and in like manner our
divine Apelles's, if they have any rare and eminent piece for stuff as well as
workmanship by them, they may do well to veil or shadow them at this season,
that art may sympathize with religion, and humane learning, as it were, put on
blacks, when divine puts on sack cloth. For my self, I need make no other
Apology to you than the Apostle does to the Corinthians, in my text. The words
which I handle are a warrant for the plain handling thereof; for what is I
determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him
crucified, but in effect to say, I Chrysostom. in Genesis orat. 41. (...).
purposed not to make any banquet, I bid you to no feast, I have provided you
but one dish of meat, the Lamb of God, and it but ordinarily dressed,
broached upon the Cross, that is, Jesus Christ, and him crucified?

Too exact division has the same inconvenience with ^^uinct. instit. orat. l.
4. Id viti um habet nimia quod nulla divisio, confuso simile est quicquid in
p^lverem usque secatur, deinde cum fecerunt multas parti^ulas in eandem
incidant obscuritatem, contra quam inventa partitio est. The division.
want of division: for it breeds confusion, which it should prevent, and
troubles the memory, which it should help and ease. As to handle several
parts without premising a convenient partition, is to tear asunder, and not to
carve up: so on the contrary, over-curiously to divide upon division, and
sub-divide sub-divisions, is to crumble not break the bread of life; or as
Fabius speaks, frusta facere, non membra, that is, to mince, and not (as the
Apostle requires) rightly to divide the word of truth. May it please you
therefore to go along with me through the few parts of this facile and
passab^le division.

1 The profession of the Apostle, I determined to know. 2 The object of his
profession, positively, Jesus Christ. privatively, nothing but him.
3 The condition of the object, And him crucified.
As the Zab lib. de trib^^ pr^^agnitis.
Logicians in the subjects of all sciences distinguish rem consideratam, and
modum considerandi; the matter considerable, which they call the material
object, and the manner of considering it, which they call the formal: as in
Physic the res considerata, or material object, is corpus humanum man's body,
the modus considerandi, or formal object, is qua sanabile, as curable: in
Music the res considerata is numerus, number, the modus considerandi is qua
sonorus as it is found in sounds, and serves to harmony: So here the res
considerata, the thing, or rather person to be considered is Jesus Christ; the
modus considerandi manner of considering him, is qua crucifixus, as crucified.
The best nurture is in the school of the cross, but then this cross must be
the cross of Christ Jesus, and Christ Jesus must be known, and lastly this
knowledge must be desired, or resolved to be got.

1 Nothing is more to be desired than knowledge, I desire, or have determined
to know.

2 No knowledge more to be desired than of Jesus Christ, Nothing but Jesus
Christ.

3 Nothing of Jesus Christ is more to be desired to be known, than that he
was crucified, And him crucified. Of all things knowledge is most to be set by,
for Joh. 17.3.
this is life eternal to know thee to be very God, and whom thou have sent
Jesus Christ. Of all knowledge this of Christ is most excellent, Phil. 3 8.
for I account, says the Apostle, all things as dung in comparison of the
knowledge of Christ. Of all Christian knowledge this of the cross is most
comfortable; for Gal. 6.14.
God forbid, says he, that I should rejoice in any thing save in the cross
of Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. These
points I shall clear to your understanding, and press upon your devout
affections, Gods grace assisting, your patience encouraging, and the time
permitting me.

I determined to know nothing among you, etc. No people under the cope of
heaven were more desirous of knowledge, or capable of a greater measure
thereof, than the Corinthians, that were Pupilla Graeciae, the apple of Greece,
the eye of the world; and none more furnished with divine and humane knowledge
than my Apostle, whose portion, especially of acquired learning, was like to
Benjamins (of whose tribe he was) Genesis 43.34.
five times greater than his brethren. (...) Eras. Adag.
Yet this every way accomplished Doctor of the Gentiles, so enriched with all
knowledge, at Corinth the prime City of Greece, the Royal Exchange (if I may
so speak) of all arts and sciences, whither men of ordinary rank and quality
might not easily have access; among these who heard of Saint Paul, that he
had been 2 Cor. 12.2.
rapt up into the third heaven, and expected that he should utter unto them
what he saw and heard there, he will be known to know nothing save Jesus
Christ, and him crucified. All that he took up at Gamaliels feet he laid
down at Christ's; he buried his jewels of Egypt which cost him so dear, under
the wood of the cross, as Jacob did Labans idols Genesis 35.4.
under the oak at Sichem. He not only under-valueth them in respect, but
makes no reckoning of them.

I esteem nothing of any, nor will be esteemed for any knowledge, save of
Jesus Christ and him crucified. The coherence.
Which words are spoken by the Apostle here by way of apology to certain of
the Corinthians, who, prepossessed with the false Apostles, making great show
of learning and eloquence, could not away with the Apostles plainer and simpler
kind of teaching, without ostentation of art or mixture of secular learning.
To these he addresseth himself after this manner, ver. 1. And I, brethren,
when I came unto you, came not with excellency of words, or wisdom, declaring
unto you the testimony of God: For I determined not to know any thing among you
save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. My speech, and my preaching was not with
enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of
power, that your faith might not stand in the wisdom of man, but in the power
of God. In effect he confesses that his words were not so picked, The sense.
his phrase so choice, his composition so smooth, his sentences so fluent, his
cadences so sweet, his language so polite, his style so flourishing, or his
lines so strong, as were those of the false Apostles, who with their puffed up
eloquence and word wisdom sought to bring into contempt the simplicity of the
Gospel. I seek not, says he (in effect) to approve my doctrine unto you by
Tropes of Rhetorike, or Syllogismes of Logic, or Axioms of Philosophy, but
by the evidence of the Spirit. I profess no science among you but the science
of the cross: and surely the plainest and simplest method and manner of
teaching best fitteth it. Were it decent and agreeable, think you, to treat of
God his emptying himself in swelling words? to speak of Christ his abasing
himself in a lofty style? to discourse sweetly upon gall and vinegar? to beset
nails and thorns with flowers of Rhetoric? and to bring our Savior in
pomp of words and vainglorious pageants of art to his cross? Let them make
ostentation of their learning and eloquence who preach themselves; I that am a
Minister of Christ and called to preach him, make conscience to add any thing
of mine own that may detract from him, or any way obscure the doctrine of the
Gospel.

making merchandise thereof, expose it to sale in their sermons: they must not
seek to value themselves chiefly by it, or make any show or ostentation thereof
to the obscuring, or any way disparaging the doctrine of the Gospel. There are
many simples go to the making of a sovereign Electuary, which yet cannot be
discerned in it when it is made: we see not the honey-suckles and other sweet
flowers which Kine feed upon in the spring, Virg Geor. 4.
Attamen occultum referunt in lacte saporem; yet we have the taste of them in
the milk. The Prince of the Roman Orators illustrateth the like observation
by a similitude drawn from those that walk in the sun; Cic. de orat. l. 1
who though they walk not to that end to be sunne-burnt, yet if they walk
long they will be so: in like manner though a man study not the arts to this
end to gain an opinion of learning or skill in them, nay though he conceal
art (which is a high point of art) with all possible art; yet by that which he
performs in his pleading of causes it will appear how he has profited in
them.

I determine to know nothing, etc. The Apostle seems to be very flat upon
the negative, and by a kind of Ostracisme to banish all eminency of secular
learning out of the school of Christ: yet as Saint Chrysin hunc ^^cum.
Chrysostom well notes, he does not absolutely condemn humane learning and
eloquence, wherein himself excelled; for that had been to slurre his own
perfections: but the edge of his Apostolical reprehension falls upon the
abuse, ostentation, or over-prising it to the prejudice of the knowledge of
Christ crucified. I know the ground I now tread upon is slippery, and therefore
I must carefully look to my feet lest they slide on either side. To derogate
from the all sufficiency of Scripture is sacrilege and blasphemy; and on the
other side, to detract from the worth and credit of arts and sciences is
anabaptisticall frenzy; the truth in the middle may be laid down in this
Aphorism, Scripture is of it self abundantly sufficient for us, but we are
not sufficient for it without the help of the arts, or, as we term them,
liberal sciences. We cannot sufficiently either conceive our selves, or
declare to our hearers the works of God without natural Philosophy, nor the
law of God without moral, nor the attributes of God without the Metaphysickes,
nor the dimensions of the Arc and Temple without the Mathematickes, nor the
songs of Sion without Music and Poetry. We cannot interpret the text of
Scripture without Grammar, analyze it without Logic, press and apply it
without Rhetoric. Wherefore let Brownists and Separatists scoff at
University learning, as the Fox in the Greek Epigram disparageth the fair
and ripe grapes on a high tree, because they were out of his reach; we must be
always thankful to God for his bounty to us, in enriching our schools with
this treasure. Which no way obscureth the glory, or diminishes the price and
excellency of the doctrine of the cross; if in humility we submit it to
Scripture, and our selves to the holy Fathers of the Church their directions:
which are three; 1 To purge and cleanse it. 2 To subject it to, and make it
serve divine knowledge. 3 To use it moderately, without affectation; and
modestly, without ostentation.


1 To purge and cleanse it; for the best of it is but like oar, which must be
washed, and pass through the stamping mill, and the fire too, before it make
pure metal. St. Epist. 26. Sin adamaveris captivam mulierem, id est,
sapientiam secularem, and ejus pulchritudine captus fueris, decalva eam, and
illecebras crinium, and ornamenta verborum cum emortuis unguibus seca, lava came
prophetali nitio, and multos tibi foetus captiva dabit.
Jerome gives sage counsel to any that fall in love with secular learning,
which he there fitly terms the Bondwoman: If, says he, thou love the
Bondwoman, and art taken with her beauty, cut off her hair, that is, her
superfluous ornaments of words, and pare her nails, and wash her with the
Prophets soape; and then if thou marry her she will bring thee much fruit. Yet
take heed thou dotest not upon her, nor too highly esteemest of her: such fond
affection cost Heliodorus his Bishopric, and Theopompus his wits; who, as
Jos. l. 12. ant. c. 2. Eusebius. l. 8. Evang. praep. c. 1.
Josephus and Eusebius write, when he went about (as he thought) to adorn and
embellish the Scripture with Greek eloquence, was distracted and troubled in
mind, and enforced to give over his intended purpose. Whatsoever some men
profess in words, it is evident that in their practice they under-value
Scripture, and too high esteem secular learning; whose chief labor is in
their Sermons (...), to preach art and wit; or, as the Apostle speaks,
themselves, not Christ. Neither are those hearers free from this sacrilegious
error, robbing God of his honor, and the Scriptures of their excellency, who
account those the rarest Sermons which are no Sermons at all. Of which it may
be said as the Countryman spoke of a goodly head exquisitely painted, (...);
What an excellent scull is this, and yet there is no brain in it? A Sermon
without divinity, fraught only with picked phrases, and numerous sentences,
cannot be fitter compared than to Onesilus his head, of which Herod. in Melpom.
Onesili caput suspensum cum jam exinanitum esset examen apum ingressum favo
refersit.
Herodotus reports that it was empty of brain, and in stead thereof filled
with honey combs. Eras. Apoph. l. 1.
Lysander refused rich apparel made up after the luxurious garb of the
Sicilians, which Dionysius sent to his daughters, saying, Vereor ne his amictae
turpes videantur. When the King of Persia sent to Aelian. var. hist. l. 14.
Antalcidas a garland of Roses, perfumed with sweet spices and odours, the
Lacedaemonian Captain accepted of his good will, but found fault with his
Present, saying, Rosarum odorem, naturaeque fragrantiam artis adulteratione
perdidisti. They whom it concerns can well interpret and apply these stories
to themselves; who if they will show themselves faithful suitors for their
Master, and not wooers for themselves, they must follow Origens advice, and
conceal Art as much as may be. In Exodus 34.
Moses, says he, coming from the mount put a veil upon his face when it
shone, that the people might not see it: so should the Preachers of the word
obscure the shining of humane learning (especially in their homilies and
exhortations to the people) lest the Cross of Christ be made of none effect.
The Mat. 23.19.
gold sanctifies not the Altar, but the Altar the gold: humane learning
improveth not divine, but contrariwise divine improveth it. The Arts are holy
in their use only, which is to attend upon sacred knowledge; and whilst they
do so the law intitleth them to some kind of holiness. Nam quae sacris
serviunt profana non sunt: those things which serve holy things are not to be
accounted profane. Now if the highest preferment that humane arts and sciences
can aspire unto is to be handmaids to the sacred and saving science of
Divinity, they must not in their attendance on her exceed in their dress, and
flaunt it too much. Hagar may be arrayed decently to wait on her Mistress; but
if she begin to out-brave Sarah, she must be turned out of doors. Neither St
Paul's inlaying his Epistles with sentences of Aratus, Epimenides, and
Heraclitus Ephesius, nor Scu^^^ de (...) ^^gend^ ^^^ologia cum T^^ologia.
Clemens his Stromata, nor Eusebius his books De praeparatione Evangelica, nor
St. Augustine his Tract^ts De Civitate Dei, nor any of the ancient Fathers
(quoted by St. Hieron. epist. 84
H^erome) embellishing their writings with all variety of humane learning, will
warrant their practice who displace Scripture testimonies in their Sermons, to
make room for Moral Essays, Politic Aphorisms, Philosophical Axioms, or
Poetical Fictions. Epithets are ornaments of speech not to be contemned; Arist

yet Archidamus, says Aristotle, was much to blame for cloying his auditors
with them, and using them as meats which he should have used only as sauces.
St. Hierome in his Epistle to Marcella deservedly taxes those women who were
nimio candore deformes, who deformed their native beauty by painting themselves
too white. And Quin. l. 8. inst. orat c. 16. Ut affert lumen clav^s purp
raeloco insertus, ita certe neminem deceat plu ibus intextanotis vestis. Ne
ocul^ quidem in toto c^^po^e d cer^^t^nce (...) centum oculis venustum dixeum.
Quintilian rightly observes, that though the eyes be the most beautiful
parts of the body, yet no man would account such a man as the Poets feign Argos
to have been, who had an hundred eyes, to be a comely or beautiful man.
Pendants on the ears, a chain of pearl on the neck, and bracelets on the
arms, and rings with j^wels on the fingers may do well in noble Matrons: but
to stick the lips, and noses, and cheeks, and breast, and almost all parts of
the body, as the Bert us geograph de Peru, etc.
Peruvians do, with precious stones, wounds rather than adorneth that sex.
It is most commendable I grant to borrow of Egyptians jewels of gold, and
silver, and raiment, to the end to offer them to God for the use of the Arc:
but we must take heed that we make not Idols of these jewels, and secretly

eyes like a flaming fire, and feet like fine brass, will discern their
vainglorious pride, and stamp them and their Idols to powder. To close up
this note, though not so fit for this quire, yet not to be skipt because pricked
in the rules of my text, let all the Dispencers of Gods holy mysteries, by the
Apostles example, strive in their preaching to win souls to Christ, not
applause to themselves; to prick the heart, not tickle the ear; to leave in
their hearers minds a persuasion of their doctrine, not opinion of their
learning and eloquence; that is, in the Apostles phrase, to esteem to know
nothing save Jesus Christ.

JESUS Ma^t. Epig^. l. 9.
Nomen cum rosis violisque natum,
Quod hyblam sapit, atticosque flores,
Quod nidos olet avis superbae,
Nomen nectare dulcius beato.
A name sweeter to the smell of the soul than roses, or violets, or all the
Arabian spices in the Phoenix nest; and sweeter also to the taste than the
Athenians honey, or Nectar it self. Nothing relished St. Augustine without it:
Ignatius calls Jesus his love and only joy; Jesus amor meus crucifixus,
Jesus my love is crucified. This name Jesus was imposed by an Angel Mat. 1.21.
Mat. 1. and acknowledged by the Devil Act. 19.15. Jesus ^e know.
Act. 19. and highly advanced by God himself above all names Phil. 29. A name
abo^t all names.
Phil. 2. Three in the old Testament bare this name, and they were all types of
Christ: Jesus Nave or Josua was a type of Christ as a King, Jesus in Zechary as
a Priest, and Jesus the son of Syrach as a Prophet to reveal the secrets of
his Fathers wisdom. As all Joseph's brethrens sheaves rose up and did homage to
Joseph's sheafe* so all the attributes of God and other names of our Redeemer,
after a sort rise up and yield a kind of pre-eminence to this name, which the
Apostle styles a ver. 10.
a name above all names, at which every knee must bow. And the reason hereof is
evident to all that have yielding hearts and bending knees, and are not like
the pillars in the Philistims Temple, which were so fast set in their sockets,
that they needed a Sampson to bow them. For there is majesty in God, there is
independent being in Jehovah there is power in Lord, there is unction in
Christ, there is affinity in Immanuel, intercession in Mediator, help in
Advocate, but there is Act. 4.12.
salvation in no name under heaven but the name of Jesus. Jesus be taken
appellatively it signifies Savior, or him that saves us from 1 The wrath of
God, 2 The power of Satan, 3 The guilt and dominion of sin, 4 The sentence of
the law, 5 The torments of hell.


And to know Jesus in this acception, is to know a sovereign salve for every
sore of the conscience, a remedy against all the diseases of the mind, a
sanctuary for all offenses, a shelter from all storms, a supersedeas from all
process, and an impregnable fortress against all the assaults of our ghostly
and bodily enemies; and can you then blame the Apostle for making so much of
the knowledge of Jesus which is also Christ?

Christ, that is, anointed, a blessed and tender hearted Physician, professing
his manner of curing in his name, which is by unction, not by ustion; by
salving and plaistering, not burning and lancing. Vulnera nostra non ustione
urans sed unction^.
To know Christ is to know our King, Priest, and Prophet: For (...), signifies
a thrice sacred person anointed with oil above all his brethren, and appointed
by God, 1 A Prophet to us, 2 A Priest for us, 3 A King over us.
1 A Prophet to teach us by his Word, 2 A Priest to purge us by his Blood, 3 A
King to govern us by his Spirit.


Of Christ's prophetical function Moses prophecieth, saying, Deuteronomy. 18.15.
A Prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you like unto me, unto him ye shall
hearken: his Priesthood God confirms to him by Psalm. 110.4.
oath: his Kingdom the Angel proclaims, Luke 1.32.33.
The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his Father David, and he shall
reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there shall be no
end. Priests were anointed, as Aaron by Moses; and Prophets, as Elizeus by
Elias; and Kings, as Saul by Samuel. Christ was therefore thrice anointed as
King, Priest, and Prophet, yet is he not three anointeds, but one anointed.
And it is not unworthy our observation, that Christ's three functions are not
only mystically figured, but also after a sort naturally represented in the
oil wherewith he was anointed. 1 Oil makes a cheerful countenance, so
does Christ as a Prophet by preaching the glad tidings of the Gospel unto us.
2 Oil suppleth and cures wounds, so does Christ as a Priest the wounds of our
conscience, by anointing them with his blood. 3 Oil has a predominancy
amongst liquors; if you power wine, water, and oil into the same vessel, the
oil will be uppermost; so Christ as a King is above all creatures, and is
Sovereign over men and Angels. This his Kingly office typically shined in the
Myter of Aaron, as his Priesthood was engraven in the Jewels of his
breast plate: as for the third office of our Lord, his prophetical function,
it sounded in the golden bells hanging with the pomegranats at the high Priests
skirts. By this glympse you may see and know what it is to know Jesus Christ.
This Jesus had not bin a Jesus to us if he had not bin Christ, that is,
anointed by God, and enabled by his threefold office to accomplish the perfect
work of our redemption: neither could Christ have been our Christ if he had
not been crucified to satisfy for our sins, and reconcile us to God his
Father by his death upon the cross; therefore the Apostle adds, and him
crucified.

Crucified. And so I fall upon my last Note, a Note to be quavered upon with
fear and trembling in the Antheme set for Good Friday; yet it will not be
amiss to tune our voice to it at this time. For this is also a Friday, and
next unto it, and in sight of it: and we all know that if there be many
Instruments on a Table, and you strike one string of any one of them, the
strings in the other that carry the same note (though untouched) give some
sound at the same instant: in like manner all the Fridayes throughout the
year, especially those that fall in Lent, ought to sound out some of the Notes
of the doleful song that was pricked on that day, not with a pen, but with a
spear, the burden whereof was Christ crucified.

Crucified. In this word the Apostle briefly casts up the total of Christ's
sufferings; the particulars whereof were his 1 Fears and sorrows, 2
Indignities and disgraces, 3 Tortures and torments.
His agony and bloody sweat, his betraying and taking, his arraigning and
condemning, his stripping and whipping, his mocking and spitting on, his
pricking and nailing to the cross. The cross had four parts, 1 An
arrectorium, which was the maine tree fastened in the earth and standing
upright toward heaven. 2 Scabellum, a planke to which the feet were nailed. 3
Lignum transversum, a cross piece of wood whereto the hands were nailed. 4
Verticem, the top or place above the head, where the inscription was put.


To the dimensions of which parts the Ephesians. 3.18.
Apostle seems to allude in his sacred Mathematickes, that, says he, you
may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and
depth, and height. The breadth seems to have reference to the lignum
transversum, the length to the arrectorium, the depth to the scabellum, and
height to the vertex of the cross. Those who are conversant in Jewish
antiquities, observe that crucifying succeeded in place of strangling among
them; wherein the special providence of God is to be marked, that although
the Romans changed the form of the death, yet they changed not the Tree; he
that was crucified as well as he that was strangled hanged upon a tree, and
thereby became Deuteronomy. 21.23.
accursed by the law. A circumstance whereof the Apostle makes a most
comfortable use, saying, Gal. 3.13.
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us,
for it is written, cursed is every one that hangs on a tree. The consequents
of sin are three: 1 Shame, 2 Pain, 3 Curse.


All these Christ suffered on the cross for us. 1 Pain, in his being nailed,
racked and pierced. 2 Shame, in being placed between two thieves, and that
naked, on their solemn feast day on which there was a concourse of innumerable
people at Jerusalem. 3 The curse, in hanging upon the tree, being fastened
thereto with nails; which is properly crucifixion or crucifying.

In sum, to be crucified is to be put to a most painful, ignominious, and
accursed death: first, to be stripped stark naked, stretched upon a gibbet or
cross, there to have four nails driven into the most tender and sinewy parts
of the body, then to be set up and exposed to open shame, to be a spectacle
of misery to the world, to Angels, and to men, and so to hang upon his own
wounds with continual increase of torments, till either extremity of famine
has exhausted the vital spirits, or extremity of pain has rended and
evaporated the substance of the heart into sighs and groans. All this the
Son of God suffered for us, and yet this is not all: For we must not think
that Christ's hands and feet were only crucified, which yet alone were
fastened to the cross; his eyes were after a sort crucified when he beheld
the Disciple whom he loved, together with his dearest Mother weeping out her
eyes under him: his ears were crucified when he heard those blasphemous words,
others he has saved, himself he cannot save; if he be the Son of God let
him come down from the cross: his smell was crucified with the stench of
Golgotha: his taste with gall and vinegar; and last of all, and most of all,
his heart was crucified with four considerations, that entered deeper into his
soul than the nails and spear into his body. These were, 1 The obstinacy and
impenitency of the Jews. 2 The utter destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple.
3 The guilt of the sins of the whole world. 4 The full wrath of his Father.
For Christ charged himself with the sins of all the Elect, and therefore
his Father laid a most heavy burden of punishment upon him: so heavy that in
bearing it he sweat blood; so heavy that he complains in piteous manner,
Mat. 26.38.
my soul is heavy unto death; yea and seems to buckle under it, crying out,
Mat. 27.46.
My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? All this Christ suffered for us,
and yet this is not all, for, Cyprian. de patientia.
qui adoratur in coelis nondum vindicatur in terra, he that is adored in
heaven is not yet fully revenged upon earth. Revenged said I? nay he is still
wronged, he continually suffers in his members, and after a sort in himself
by the contemners of the Gospel, mis-believers, and scandalous livers. Because
the cross is the trophee of Christ's victory over sin, death, and hell, Satan
has a deadly spite at it, and as he has done heretofore, so he does at this
day employ all his agents to demolish and deface it; namely, by 1 Jews, 2
Gentiles, 3 Papists, 4 Separatists, or Non-conformitants: all four enemies to
the cross of Christ.
1 The Jews make it a stumbling block. 2 The Gentiles a laughing stock. 3
The Papists an Idol. 4 The Separatists a scarre-crow.
1 To the Jews it is an offense. 2 To the Gentiles foolishness. 3 To the
Papists superstition. 4 To the Separatists and Precifians an abomination.


As it was the manner of the Spartanes in the worship of Diana, to whip naughty
boys before her altars, so I hold it an act of piety and charity to scourge
these four sorts of men before the cross of Christ in my text; and first the
Jew, who makes a stumbling block of the cross.

Use 1. cont. Jud.
O unbelieving Jew, why do thou stumble at that which is the chief stay of an
humble and faithful soul? is it because the cross of Christ casts an
aspersion of innocent blood spilt by thy ancestors? Repent for their sin and
thine own, and by faith dippe thine hand in this his blood; it has this
wonderful virtue, that it cleanses even those hands that were imbrued in it.
He is quickened, says Saint Cyprian, by the blood of Christ, even who a little
before spilt Christ's blood. Is it because thy glorious fancy of the temporal
throne of thy so long expected Messiah cannot stand with the ignominious cross
of Christ? reprove this thy folly, and convince this thine error out of the
mouth of thine own Prophets which have been since the world began. Ought not
Dan 9.26.
Messiah to be slain after sixty two weeks? ought not Christ to suffer such
things, and so to enter into his glory? what is written of him, and how read
thou in thy noble Prophet of the royal race? Esa. 53.8. and 5.
He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgressions of my
people was he stricken. He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his
stripes we are healed: therefore was Barabbas acquitted, and Jesus condemned
to the scourge and the cross. Again, ver. 12.
he powered his soul unto death, and he was numbered with the transgressors:
therefore Jesus was executed with two malefactors, the one on the right hand,
the other on the left. Again, he bare the sin of many, and made
intercession for the transgressors: therefore Jesus when they crucified him,
said, Luke 23.34.
Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. How read thou in
Moses law? Deuteronomy. 21.23.
cursed is he that hangs on a tree: therefore Jesus who became a curse for
us, hung on the tree of the cross. Again, all things by the law are purged by
sprinkling of blood with a bunch of Hyssope: therefore Jesus blood was Joh.
19.29.
shed upon the cross, and a bunch of Hyssope there offered unto him. How
read thou in the book of Psalms? Psalm. 22.21.
they gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to
drink: therefore Jesus said on the cross, I thirst, and they filled a sponge
full of vinegar, and put it on a reed and gave him to drink. Again, Psalm.
22.18.
they parted my garments among them, says David Christ his type, and on my
vesture did they cast lots: therefore after Jesus Mat. 27.35.
gave up the Ghost, the soldiers parted his garments, and cast lots. Christ
was fastened to the wood of the cross as Genesis 22.9.
Isaak was bound to the faggot. Behold the type accomplished, and the scripture
fulfilled, he Esa. 53.10.
made his soul an offering for sin, be not faithless but believe. Christ
was lift up Number. 21.9.
upon the cross, as the brazen serpent was set up upon a pole for a sign.
Behold the type accomplished, and the scripture fulfilled, Zach. 12.10.
they shall look upon him whom they have pierced, be not faithless but
believe. Christ's flesh was torn, bruised, pierced, and as it were, broached on
the cross, as the paschall Lamb, yet without any bone broken. Behold the type
accomplished, and the scripture fulfilled, Psalm. 22.16.
they pierced my hands and feet, and thou Psalm. 34.20.
keep all my bones, so that not one of them is broken. Be not faithless but
believe, since every circumstance of Christ's passion is a substantial proof,
every indignity offered unto him is an Axiom, every nail and thorn a
poignant argument, every mark and scarre in his flesh a demonstration a signo,
and his extension on the cross a declaration and ostension, that he is the
true Messiah.

The Jew has his payment; I now take the Gentile to task, Us. 2 Contr. Graec.
and Gentiles.
who makes a laughing stock of the cross. O foolish Greek, why do thou
esteem the doctrine of the cross foolishness, in which all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge are hid? The Abderites took Democritus for a man
besides himself; but Hypocrates that great Physician made them know that they
were out of their wits, not the Philosopher. The folly, O Greek, is in thy
judgment, not in the doctrine of the cross; the shadow is in thine eye, or the
dust in thy spectacle, and not in the object: for had thou a single eye, and
a clear spectacle, thou might see the cross beset with four Jewels; 1
Wisdom in the height and top. 2 Humility in the depth and basis. 3 Obedience
on the right side. 4 Patience on the left.
Thou might see by God his infinite wisdom light drawn out of darkness,
and good out of evil, and order out of confusion. Thou might observe in it
infinite justice and mercy reconciled: thou might admire glory conquered by
shame, power overcome by weakness, wisdom confounded by folly, death killed
by dying, the grave destroyed by being buried in it, and hell by descending
into it. Yea, but thy pride will not brook to have any faith in a man
crucified, or to hope for salvation from him who could not save himself from
the accursed tree. Indeed if he had been enforced thus to die, if he had not
laid down his life of his own accord, and made his soul an offering for
sin, thy objection had something in it considerable: but since he dyed by
power and not of infirmity; (for though to dye simply be of infirmity, yet so
to dye, to lay down his life at his own pleasure, and take it up again was of
power;) since being in the form of God he Phil. 2.8.
humbled himself to death, even the death of the Cross, and in it triumphed
over death, hell, and the Devil: stop thy mouth for ever from blaspheming the
cross, or rather open it to the everlasting praise of him that dyed on it;
whose misery (if thou believe) is thy happiness, his ignominy thy glory, his
death thy life, his Cross thy Crown. Thou eternizest the memory of Codrus,
Curtius, the Decii, and D. Claudius, for devoting and sacrificing themselves
for their Country: how can thou then but much more love and honor, yea, and
adore Jesus Christ, who Codrus-like put on the habit of a common soldier, or
rather servant, and dyed in the battle to gain us an everlasting victory
over all our enemies: Curtius-like leapt into the Hiatus, or gulf of death and
hell, to save mankind from it: Decius and Claudius-like, devovit se pro
terrarum orb, gave himself up to death for the life of the whole world?

And so I let the Greek pass: the Romanists turn is next, who makes an Idol
of the Cross. Contra Papist.
O superstitious Papist, why do thou vow pilgrimages, and creep on all four
to the Cross? Why do thou fall down at it, and often lash thy self before
it? Why do thou kiss it, and weep upon it, and make a wooden prayer to it,
saying, Ave lignum, spes unica; all hail thou wood of the Cross, our only
hope? Was the Cross crucified for thee? Did thy gilt crucifix die for thee?
Have thou not heard how the Gentiles of old traduced the Christians, quod
Minutius F^elix (...). O^^. 12 10.
Crucis erant religiosi, that they religiously worshipped the Cross; and what
answer the godly Fathers in those purest times returned unto them, Cruces nec
habemus nec optamus, we neither have Crosses nor desire them? Did thou never
hear what S. Helena the renowned mother of great Constantine did when she
discovered the true Cross to which our Lord was nailed, by the inscription?
St. Ambrose tells thee Orat. de obit. Theod. Invenit titulum, Regem adoravit,
non utique lignum, quia hic est Gentilis error and vanitas.
she espied the title, she adored the King, not the wood verily, for that is a
heathenish error and vanity; but she worshipped him who hung upon the Tree.
If the Cross be a creature, and latrie be divine worship, Cross latrie which
thou practisest, and thy Church teaches, can be no other than gross
Idolatry. Me thinks I hear a new bell ring in my ear, that Papists are not
so blockish as to adore the wooden Cross; this is but a scandal put upon
them by some braine-sicke Novellist. They yield only a reverend respect to it
as Protestants themselves do to the Font, to the Chalice, and to the Communion
Table, and no more. No more? How then construe they Cardinal Bellarmine his
words, L. 2. de imag. sanct. c. 27. Nos omnes cruces adoramus, quia verae
crucis imagines sunt.
We adore all Crosses, because all Crosses are images of the true Cross? How
wave they Orthod. explic. l. 9. Non diffitemur nos praeclarissimam Christi
crucem colere cultu latriae.
Andradius his open profession, We do not deny, or make no scruple to confess
that we worship the most excellent Cross of Christ with divine worship called
Latria? What soder have they for Jonas of Orleans his upbraiding Claudius
Taurinensis? or the Roman Inquisitor his branding the Waldenses with heresy,
for impeaching the adoration of the Cross? How can they put by their great
schooleman Aquinas p. 1. q. 25. Crux Christi, tum propter repraesentationem
Christi, tum propter contractum membrorum ejus, latria adoranda est.
Thomas Aquinas his magisteriall decision and reasons; The Cross of Christ
both in regard of the representation of Christ, and because it touched the
members of his body, is to be adored with divine worship? Verily, for this his
blasphemous conclusion, and the absurd premises out of which he infers it,
this master of the schools deserves to be whipped by his scholars, as the
schoolmaster of the Falisci was by the Roman Consul his appointment. For if
all those things are to be worshipped with Latria which represent Christ, then
all the types of the old law, yea, the brazen serpent it self, were to be
adored with religious worship; which yet the most religious King Hezekiah brake
down and stamped to powder for that very reason, because the people burnt
incense to it, and worshipped it. And if the touch of the members of Christ's
body leaves such a divine impression in the thing that touches them, that
presently veneration is due unto it, then most divine and venerable was the
dirt of Palaestine which touched Christ's feet; and Malcus his ear which
touched Christ's finger; yea, and the Ass his back which touched Christ's
thigh; and Judas his lips which touched Christ's mouth.

is such a scarcrow, that they hold aloof off it; either not coming to our
baptism at all, or if they come, snatching their children out of the hands of
the Minister before he sign them with the Cross. O supercilious and shallow
brain Cartwrightist, or Separatist, why do thou so much quarrel with an
innocent ceremony used in the christening of Innocents? The Canons of the
Church declare that we make it no sacramental action, but only a rite of
decency: no object of religious devotion, but a badge of our Christian
profession. Have thou never been taught in thy catechism that the sign is
made in the forehead, the seat of shame, to teach, that we ought not to be
ashamed of the Cross of Christ, but account it the greatest honor to fight
under this banner? Have thou never read or heard with what honorable titles
the ancient Fathers have graced this sign, terming it signum fidei, trophaeum
fidei, signum Dei, signum Dominicum, signum Christi; the sign of faith, the
trophee of faith, the banner of Christ, the ensign of the Lord? Arm your Cyp

Picus Mirandula, and others. When God would foreshew to Julian that his
Gospel should prevail, he did it by a Cross, environed with a Crown, which
he caused to appear to him in the entrails of a beast in the midst of his
divining. When he would make it known to the Jews that his Gospel should
prevail against them, who then repaired the Temple of Jerusalem to disgrace
it, he did it by certain signs of Crosses appearing in the builders garments.
Last of all, when he would foreshew the renewing of his Gospel by Martin
Luther, he did it in anno 1450. by bloody Crosses, nails, spunges and
spears, which appeared in the garments of men and women. What folly, if not
impiety, is it then in that English fugitive, and Parke^, in his book inti^ul
d, Symbolizing with Papists.
Amsterdamian Separatist, to style this sign of the Cross a mark of the
beast, the cognizance of the harlot of Rome, the character of Antichrist, nay,
the dumb vicar of the Devil; and to indite it of felony, theft, murder,
adultery, and concupiscence! The sign of the Cross, though it cannot speak,
yet by signs pleads not guilty to them all: for it stays not, nor has any
abode at all, and therefore cannot commit any such foul facts. It is made in
the air, which instantly closes, and gives the sign no permanencie to do
or suffer any evil: those accusations therefore lie not against it, but
suddenly vanish into air with the sign it self.

Yea, but say our Nonconformitants, we have other real objections against the
sign of the Cross, which cannot be blown away as these aeriall with a blast
of wind. For we will bring good proof, that this ceremony in baptism was
first devised, and the sign of the Cross taken up by the Valentinian
Heretics, and since it has been horribly abused by superstitious Papists;
pack therefore it must suddenly away with the rest of Popish trumperie.
Festi^a lent, soft and fair.

1 Were the sign of the Cross at the first made and brought into the Church
by the Valentinians, it will not follow that presently we must cast it out
after them. For though we are forbid to give that which is Matthew. 7.6.
holy to dogs, yet we are not forbid to take that which is holy from dogs: we
may not cast pearl before Swine, yet we may take a pearl from a Swines snout,
as Lapidaries do a precious stone out of the head of a Toad, or as the Prophet
Elias did, savory meat from the impure bill of a Raven.

2 We absolutely deny that Heretics either first made this sign, or
introduced it into baptism. For though it be most confidently affirmed by
Cartwright, Parker, and other Authors of schism amongst us, that the sign of
the Cross was first devised or cried up by the Heretics above named; yet
Irenaeus, whom they allege for it, says no such thing: he speaks not a word
in the places quoted by them of the sign of the Cross, but of the name of the
Cross; nor of Christ's Cross, but of Valentinus his God Aeons Cross. All that
he has in his declaration against those Heretics touching this point, is,
that Valentinus the Heretic called one of his fantastical Aeons by two
names, (...) and (...), that is, bound or definition, and Cross. Now if we may
not use the sign of the Cross, because that Heretic called his feigned God
Cross, by the like reason we may not make definitions in Logic, nor keep
bounds in our fields, because he called his Aeon Horon, that is, bound or
definition. Had the Valentinians used the sign of the Cross as they did the
name, yet that is no sufficient proof that they devised this sign, or brought
it first into the Church. It is certain that this sign was by many Aeons,
that is, ages ancienter than Valentinus his Aeons, or his heresy. We find some
print of it in Dial. cum Tryph. Jud.
Justine Martyr his Dialogue against Tryphon: Nazianzen and other Fathers note
an expression of it in Josuah's fight with Amaleck: Sozomen shows solid
characters thereof in the Temple of Serapis: in the ruins whereof, amongst
other Hieroglyphickes, the Cross was taken up; at the sight whereof many of
the Egyptians were astonished, and partly induced thereby to embrace the
Christian faith. The first is therefore a limping objection, and the second
halteth downright. It was this, Papists have horribly abused the sign of the
Cross, ergo we may not use it. To argue in such sort from the abuse to the
taking away of all use of a thing, is an abuse of arguing, and a mere non
sequitur, as Rhet. l. 1. c. 1.
Aristotle teaches; for there is nothing in the world that may not be abused
save virtue. What creature of God has not been abused by Gentiles to
Idolatry? What ordinance of God is not at this day abused by Papists to
superstition? be it the Church, or Communion Table, the Pulpit, nay the
Scriptures and Sacraments themselves. The Papists abuse lights in the Church,
must we therefore sit at Evensong in the dark? They abuse Frankincense,
offering it to their Images; may not we therefore use it in a dampish room?
They abuse Godfathers and Godmothers, to make a new affinity hindering marriage
in such parties; will they therefore christen their children without witness^s?
Excreate sodes; Papists abuse spittle, mingling it with chrisme, and putting it
in the mouth of the child when they baptize it; will they therefore never
spit? It is not the Valentinians first use, or the Papists abuse, or any thing
in the Cross it self, savouring of superstition; but a cross humor in
themselves which stirs them up to cavil at, and always quarrel with the
warrantable and decent rites and commendable constitutions of their Mother the
Church of England; to whose censure I leave them, and come to our selves.

If any here present at the hearing of these things shall be pricked in heart,
Act. 2.37.
as the Jews were at * Saint Peter's Sermon upon this subject, and shall demand
of me, as they did of him and the rest of the Apostles, quid faciemus? what
shall we do? I answer in his words, ver. 38.
repent and be baptized every one of you (not in the first which is already
past) but in the second baptism, which is of tears; Psalm. 4.4.
stand in awe and sin no more, commune with your own heart in your chamber and
be still, crucify the world, and the pompes, the flesh and the lusts thereof,
break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by alms to the
poor, humble your souls by watching and praying, fasting and mourning.
Prostrate your selves before Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and after you
have bathed your eyes in brinish tears, and anointed them with the eye salve
of the spirit, look up with unspeakable comfort on your Savior hanging on the
cross, stretching out his arms to embrace you, bowing down his head as it
were to kiss you, behold in his pierced hands, and feet, and side, holes to
hide you from the wrath of God, behold nails to fasten the handwriting
against you, being cancelled, to his cross; behold vinegar to search and
cleanse all your wounds, behold water, and blood, and hyssope to purge your
consciences, and lastly, a sponge to wipe out all your debts out of his Fathers
tables. Which the Father of mercy, and God of all consolation grant, at the
suite, and for the merit of Jesus Christ and him crucified: to whom with the
Father, and blessed Spirit be rendered all glory, praise, and thanksgiving now
and for ever, Amen.

THE TREE OF LIFE SPRINGING OUT OF THE GRAVE: OR Primitiae Sepulchri. A Spitall
Sermon preached on Monday in Easter week, April 22. THE THIRTEENTH SERMON.
1 COR. 15.20. But now Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first
fruits of them that slept.


Right Honorable, etc.
Plin. in panegyr. Aegyptus gloriata est se nihil imbribus coeloque debere.
Siquidem proprio semper amne perfusa, tantis segetibus induebatur, ut cum
feracissimis terris quasi nunquam cessura certaret.
PLiny the younger writes of Egypt, that she was wont to boast how she owed
nothing to the clouds, or any foreign streams for her fertility, being
abundantly watered by the sole inundation of her own river Nylus. A like or
greater privilege (it must be confessed) this renowned City has for a long
time enjoyed, in that she has not been indebted to any wandering clouds; nor
needs she to fetch the water of life from any foreign river, or neighbor
spring, being richly stored by the overflowing industry and learning of her
most able and painful Preachers within her self; filling not only the
lesser cisternes of private congregations, but the greater also of these most
celebrious and solemn assemblies. And for mine own part, so let the life
blasts of the spirit refresh me in the sweat of my holy labors, and the dew of
heavenly benediction fall upon your religious ears, as I never sought this
place, nor am come hither to make ostentation of any so much as conceived gifts
in me, nor to broach any new opinions of mine, or any other, nor to set before
you any forbidden fruit though never so sweet, and to a well conditioned
stomach wholesome; nor to smooth or level the uneven ways of any, who plow
in the Lords field with an ox and an ass, much less to gain vulgar
applause, or spring an hidden vein of unknown contribution, by traducing the
public proceedings in the State or Church; but only in obedience to the call
of lawful authority, to build you in your most holy faith, and elevate your
devotion to the due celebration of this high feast of our Lords resurrection;
and by crying as loud as I am able to awake those that sleep in sinful
security, that they may stand up from the dead, and Christ may give them and us
all light of knowledge, joy, and comfort. Which that I may be enabled to
perform, I humbly entreat the concurrence of your patience, with your prayers
to God for his assistance in opening the scripture now read in your ears.

But now Christ is risen, etc. This is no sterill or barren text, you hear of
fruits in it; and although the harvest thereof has been reaped by many
Laborers before me, yet there remain good gleanings for me also, and those
that shall leaze after me, even till the Angels shall thrust their sickle into
the large field of the ripe world, and reap the reapers themselves. The fruit
is of two sorts: 1 Christ's prerogative. 2 The deceased Saints privilege, who
in their degree participate with him.


He is above them, yet with them; he is the first fruits, and they are the
rest of the heap: and Romans 11.16.
if the first fruits be holy, the whole heap is holy. The ground which
bears this fruit, Occasio and scopus.
is the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, which the Apostle like a
provident husbandman first fenceth and makes sure, and after breaks and
lays it down. He fenceth it from the beginning of this chapter to the 35.
verse, by invincible arguments confirming the truth of the resurrection:
afterward, to the end of the chapter he lays it down, by apt and lively
similitudes declaring the manner thereof.

And this he does with much vehemence and contention of arguments, his zeal
being kindled through blasts of contradiction by some in the Church of Corinth,
who directly denied the former, verse 12. and obliquely carped at the latter,
verse 35. Neither did these alone at Corinth (as much as in them lay) subvert
this maine article of our faith, 2 Timothy 2.18.
but Hymeneus and Philetus, with others at Ephesus perverted the sense of it,
saying that the resurrection was past already.

Whence I first observe against Bellarmine, Parsons, and other Papists, that
the Devil tied not himself (as they have surmized) to any rule of method, ex
occas.
in laying his batteries against the articles of the Creed in order. For the
resurrection of the flesh is the last article save one, yet heretical impiety
(as you have heard) first ventured on it. Howbeit the Cardinal, that he might
more conveniently tie all whom he supposes Heretics in one chain, and
thrust us into the lowest place, Bellar. orat. habit in Gymnas. Ro^ anno 1576.
H^manigeneris ostis, e^itotus alioqui perversus and ordinis perturbator esse
soleat, tamen non sine aliquo ordine catholicae ecclesiae veritatem oppugnate
vol^^t, etc.
bears his Reader in hand, that the enemy of mankind, albeit in other things
he be a disturber of order, yet in impeaching the Apostles creed has kept a
kind of order. 1 For within 200. years after Christ he assaulted the first
article, concerning God the Father almighty maker of heaven and earth, by the
Simonians, Menandrians, Basilidians, Valentinians, Marcionites, Manichees, and
several kind of Gnostickes.

2 After 200. years he set upon the second article, concerning the divine
nature of Christ by the Praxeans, Noetians, Sabellians, and Samosetanians.

3 In the next age he opposed the divine person of our Savior, by the
Photineans, Arrians, and Eunomians.

4 From 400. to 800. he impugned the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh,
concerning the incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension of our Lord, and
his coming to judgment, by the Nestorians, Theodorians, Eutychians, Acephali,
Sergians, and Paulians.

5 From the year 800. to 1000. he bid battle to the eighth article,
concerning the holy Ghost, by the schism and heresy of the Graecians.

6 Lastly, from the 1000. year to this present age he has oppugned the ninth
and tenth articles, concerning the catholic Church and remission of sins,
by the Berengarians, Petrobrusians, Waldenses, Albigenses, Wicklefists,
Hussites, Lutherans, Zuinglians, Confessionists, Hugonites, and Anabaptists.

Refut.
Were these calculations exact, and observations true, the Cardinal deserved to
be made Master of ceremonies amongst heretics, for so well ranking them. But
upon examination of particulars it will appear, that his skill in history is
no better than his divinity. To begin where he ends. First, he most falsely
and wrongfully charge the worthy standard-bearers of the reformed religion
before Luther, with the impeaching the ninth and tenth articles of the creed.
They impeach neither of them, nor any other; nay, they will sooner part with
the best limb of their body, than any article of their creed: whereas on the
contrary side, the Romanists, as they impeach the article of Christ's
incarnation of the Virgin Mary, by teaching that his flesh is made daily by the
Priests in the Mass; not of her blood, but of bread; and of his ascension, and
sitting at the right hand of the Father, till he come to judge the quick and
the dead, by teaching that his body is at once in a Million of places on earth,
even wheresoever Masses are said: so they most manifestly overthrow the
articles he instanceth in, viz.

1 The ninth and tenth. The ninth by turning (...) into (...), universal into
particular, and empaling the whole Church within the jurisdiction of Rome, as
the Donatists did of old within the Provinces of Africa. The tenth by branding
them with the marks of heretics who believe the remission of their own
sins by special faith.

2 As the Cardinal is foulely mistaken in the point of divinity, so also in
the matter of history both of former ages, and this present wherein we live.
For who knows not that other articles besides the ninth and tenth, are at
this day oppugned by the Servetians, Antitrinitarians, Sosinians, Vorstians,
Anabaptists, Libertines, and Familists, whose heresies strike at the sovereign
attributes of God, the Trinity of persons, deity of Christ, his incarnation,
satisfaction, second coming, and life everlasting?

3 Neither were these two articles (instanced in) first impugned in our age, or
since the 1000. year, as he accounts; but long before in the third and
fourth ages, by the Novatians, Donatists, Luciferians, Meletians, and Pelagians.

4 Neither was Satan so long in setting heretics on work to undermine all
the articles of the creed. If you peruse the bedroll of heresies in Irenaeus,
Epiphanius, Philastrius, and Augustine, you shall find that within the space
of 400. years the Devil so bestirred himself, that he left no article of
the Apostles creed untouched by them.

5 And lastly, neither had the enemy of mankind any care at all of order in
employing heretics to overthrow our christian belief, more than an enraged
enemy, all set upon spoil in demolishing an house, thinks of pulling down
every stone in order; for to what end serves order when nothing but present
confusion is sought? Therefore against the rule of method set down by
Bellarmine, Satan in the second age called in question the last article of the
creed, by Papius, and the Millenaries. In the third age he called in question
the eighth article concerning the holy Ghost, by the Macedonians and
Pneumatomachi. In the first age he called in question the second article
concerning the divinity of Christ, by the Ebionites and Cerinthians: as also
the eleventh by the Ephesians, and those Corinthians whom the Apostle takes to
task in this chapter, and confuteth in my text.

My second observation from the occasion, is, that some heresies, as namely
this of the Corinthians concerning the resurrection, against which the Apostle
bends all his forces, have been very ancient, and some heretics
contemporaries to the Apostles. As God is styled (...) Dan. 7.13.
(that is, Ancient of days, or rather Ancient to days, as God speaks of
himself, Esa. 43.13.
Before the day was I am:) so the Devil is called (...), the old Serpent;
whose spawne are all heresies, as well old as new. No truth at the first
delivery thereof could be ancient, nor can any error after it has long
passed from hand to hand, be new. Time is without the essence of those things
that are measured by it; and consequently cannot make that which is in it self
evil, good; nor that which is good, evil. Antiquity can no more prescribe for
falsehood, than novelty prejudice the truth. Bare antiquity therefore is but a
weak plea in matter of religion ( Tertul. de Vol. Virg.
quodcunque contra veritatem sapit haeresis est, etiam vetus consuetudo)
whatsoever savoureth not of truth, or is against it, is heresy, yea although
it be ancient, and plead custom. 1 It was the Samaritans plea against the
Jews, Joh. 4.20.22.
Our Father worshipped in this mount, etc. But it was rejected by our Savior,
saying, you worship you know not what.

2 It was the plea of the heretics called Aquarii against the Catholics, but
disproved by Saint Ep. 74. Consuetudo sine veritate est vetustas ^rroris.
Cyprian, saying, Custom without truth is no better than inveterate error.

3 It was the plea of Guitmundus against the practice of the Roman Church in
Gregory the great his days, but disparaged by him, saying, custom ought to
give place to truth and right: Great. did. 8.
for Christ said not, Ego sum consuetudo, I am custom or prescription, but,
Ego sum veritas, I am truth.

Nay, it was the very plea of the Paynims against the Christians, and long ago
disabled by the ancient Fathers, Saint Ignatius, Arnobius, Ambrose, and
Augustine. Ignatius thus puts it by, Some say they will not believe the truth
of the Gospel, if we produce not ancient records for it; to whom my answer
is, Ignat. epist ad Philad. (...).
Christ is my antiquity, his words are to me in stead, or as good as all
ancient records. Arnob. l. 2. cont. gent. Quod verum est se^um non est, etc.
Arnobius gravely determines the point, the authority, says he, of Religion is
to be weighed, not by time, but by the divine author thereof; that which is
true is not to be traduced as late or too new. Saint Amb. l. 3. ep. 30
Reprobatis messem quia sera est foecunditas, etc.
Ambrose seconds Arnobius, saying to the heathen, do you find fault with our
Christian religion, because it is later than your heathenish superstition? you
may by the same reason pick a quarrel with harvest, because it comes not till
the end of summer, and with the vintage because it falls late in the year, and
with the olive because he bears fruit after other trees. Lastly, Saint
Quaest. vet. and novi Test. Quasi antiquitas praejudicet veritati, hic est mos
diabolicus ut per antiquitatis traducem commendetur fallacia.
Austine returns them a smart answer for this absurd plea, They say that that
religion which is elder cannot be false, as if antiquity or custom could do
the truth any prejudice at all; it is a divellish custom to vent falsehood under
the title of antiquity. Whereunto may be added, that in propriety of speech
that is not antiquity which is so esteemed: the age wherein we live is indeed
the eldest, because nearest to the end of the world; and those times which we
reverence as elder, are by so much the younger by how much they were nearer to
the beginning of the world, and the birth of time it self. The Catholic
Christian Church was never so ancient as now she is. For she was made so at
Christ's death, cum e terra sublatus fuero, omnes ad me traham: like Eve she
was formed out of the second Adams side, whence issued the two Christian
Sacraments, the water of baptism, and the blood of the holy Eucharist. At the
first she was fed with the sincere milk of the word in the Apostles time, came
to her perfect growth, strength, and full dimensions in the Fathers days, when
she valiantly encountered all persecutors abroad, and heretics at home. After
600. years she began apparently to break, and in every latter age decayed
more and more, and now in most parts of the Christian world (except only where
by reformation her age is renewed) she is become decrepit, dim in the sight
of heavenly things, deaf in the hearing Gods word, stiff in the knees of true
devotion, disfigured in the face of order, weak in the sinews of faith, cold
in the heart of love, and stouping (after the manner of bowed old age) to
graven Images. Wherefore it may be doubted that Cardinal Bellarmine was (...),
participated somewhat of the infirmities of old age in his books of the notes
of the Church, where he would have Bell. de not. Eccles. l. 4 c. 5. Secunda
nota est antiquitas.
antiquity to be a proper mark of the true Church. He might as well have
assigned old age to be the proper note of a man, which neither agrees to all
men, nor to man alone, nor to any man at all times: no more does antiquity to
the Church. What need I add any more, since the truth himself has dashed
through this mark again and again? Matthew. 5.21.27.31.33.38.43. teaching us
that the essays of the ancients are not the touchstone of truth, but his
(...), I say, you have heard that it was said by them of old time, etc. But I
say unto you, etc.

Yea, but say our adversaries of Rome, Christ himself elsewhere argues from
antiquity: both affirmatively, Mat. 19.4.
He which made them at the beginning, made them male and female; and
negatively, ver. 8.
From the beginning it was not so. And Saint John also, 1 John 2.7.
This is the message which ye heard from the beginning. And Tertul. contra
Prax. Id vertum quod prius, id adulterinum quod posterius.
Tertullian, That is true which is first, that is counterfeit which is latter.
And Saint Epist. ad Pomp. Nonne ad fontem recurritur? etc.
Cyprian, saying, If the pipe which before yielded water abundantly fail
suddenly, do we not run to the spring? And the council of Calcedon crying
with one voice, (...), let the ancient rites and customs prevail: and before
them the Prophet Jeremy, Jer. 6.16.
ask for the old paths, and walk therein.

All which allegations make strongly for the prime and original antiquity, not
for any of later standing. The old paths which the Prophet Jeremy speaks of,
are the paths of Gods commandments laid down by Moses and the Prophets;
there we are to ask where is the good way, and to walk in it, not because it
is the old way, but because it is the good way. For there are old ways which
are not good ways, which God forbids us to walk in: Ezekiel. 20.18.
Walk not in the statutes of your Fathers, nor observe their judgments; And
Psalm. 49.19.
David forewarnes us of, He shall follow the generation of his Fathers, and
shall never see light. A fit poesy to be written upon the door of every
obstinate recusant among us. The council of Calcedon cries up ancient
customs and ordinances, and so do we, such as are descended from the
Apostles, or at least are not repugnant to their doctrine, and practice.

Saint Cyprians advice is good, If water fail in the pipe or conduit, or run
muddily, to have recourse to the spring; but what spring does he there point
unto? fontem dominicae traditionis, the fountain of the Lords tradition, that
is, the scriptures. Tertullians observation is true, It Is good coin that is
first stamped, and afterward that which is counterfeited: the husbandman first
sowed good seed, and then the envious man sowed tares. Let the Romanists prove
their Trent doctrine to be Dominica, and to have in it the Kings stamp, we
will admit it for current. After Christ and his Apostles had sown the good
seed, which we yet retain pure in our reformed Churches, they by their
additions have sown upon it tares. Saint John draws an argument from the
beginning of the preaching of the Gospel; and Christ from the beginning, that
is, the first promulgation of the law in Paradise. Let the Romanists fetch an
argument from antiquity so high, and we will soon join issue with them.

And to this antiquity we might strictly tie our adversaries, as Saint Cyprian
does his opposites. Cyp. ep. 3. Non debemus attendere quid aliquis ante nos
faciendum putaverit, sed quid qui ante omnes est Christus.
We must not respect, says he, what any has done before us (in the matter
about which we contend) but what Christ did which was before all. When they
pleaded ancient tradition, he demands Epist. ad Pomp. Unde est ista traditio?
utrumne de dominica and evangelica autoritate descendens? etc. si in evangelio
praecipitur, aut in apostolorum epistolis, aut actibus continetur, observetur
haec sancta traditio.
whence is that tradition? is it derived from the Gospel, or Acts of the
Apostles, or their Epistles? then let such a holy tradition be religiously
kept. And Saint Augustine Aug. contra lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 6.
stands at this ward against the Donatists: whether concerning Christ, or
concerning his Church, or concerning any thing that pertains to our faith and
life, we will not say, if we, but as he going forward adds, if an Angel from
heaven shall preach unto you but what you have received in the Scriptures of
the Law and Gospel, let him be accursed. Yet we give them a larger scope,
even till the beginning of the seventh age, wherein Mahumetanisme began to
spread in the East, and Antichristianisme in the West. For the first six
hundred years they cannot find any Kingdom, Commonwealth, Country, Province,
City, Village, or Hamlet under the cope of heaven professing their present
Trent Faith. Wherefore as Phasis, while he was highly extolling the Emperors
proclamation for placing men of quality in the Theater according to their
rank, was by that very edict thrust out of the place he had got there by
Lectius the Marshall: Mart. epig. l. 5.
Edictum domini deique nostri
Quo subsellia certiora fiunt
Et puros eques ordines recepit
Dum laudat modo Phasis in theatro,
Phasis purpureis ruber lacernis, etc.
Illas purpureas and arrogantes
Jussit surgere Lectius lacernas.
So if the plea of antiquity should simply be admitted in point of faith, our
adversaries undoubtedly would be cast by it. For although they father
bastard-treatises upon ancient writers, and by an unnatural and prodigious
generation beget Fathers at their pleasure: yet they are not able to produce
any Record, express and direct testimony, canon of Council, or
Ecclesiastical constitution,

Thus by occasion of the occasion of my text, the old heresy sprang up in
Corinth, against the eleventh article of our creed, I have cast a bone or two
to those of the Synagogue of Rome to gnaw upon, who usually creep into these
great assemblies to catch at our doctrine, and snarle at Gods Minister: and now
I wholly address my self to give the children of the Church their bread, made
of the first fruits in my text.

But now. The verse immedately going before is to this in hand as a dark foil
to a bright and precious stone, and thus it sets it off. If in this life
only we have hope in Christ, then we Apostles, the chief laborers in the
Lords harvest, are but as weeds, nay, no better than the world esteems us,
that is, very dung, and the off-scowring of all things. But now through hope in
Christ's resurrection, and by virtue thereof we are as fruits, yea holy fruits
sanctified in the first fruits, which is Christ. If there be no resurrection
from the dead, all our hope is dead and withered at the root, all our preaching
false, your faith vain, your justification void, the dead in Christ utterly
lost.

But now that Christ is risen from the dead, and so risen, that he is become
the first fruits of all that sleep in him, our hope is revived, our preaching
justified, your faith confirmed, your remission ratified, the dead but only
fallen asleep, and our condition most desirable. For the greater persecution
we suffer for Christ's sake, the greater reward we shall receive from him; the
heavier our cross is on earth, the weightier shall our crown be in heaven.

But the (...), or (but) is remarkable; for it turns the stream of the
Apostles discourse toward Paradise, which before, like Jordan, was running
apace into mare mortuum. If no resurrection, we of all men most miserable, But
because there is a resurrection, we most happy. The sky is darkest
immediately before the break of day; such was the face of the Church before
the rising of the sun of righteousness. All the stars save one were
overcast, or rather darkened: In Al^^art 3. q. ult. (...). Turr^^. l. 1. de
eccles^^^.
memory whereof the Church of Rome on Easter Eeve puts out all the lights save
one, to signify that faith then remained only in the blessed virgin; in all
other, as well Apostles as Disciples, it was eclipsed for the time. The life of
their hope dyed with their Master, and all the hope of their life was buried in
his grave. Which when they saw guarded, and a great stone rolled to the mouth
of it, their hearts were as cold as a stone. But in the proper season of this
now in my text, the Angel removed that stone from the sepulcher (and this from
their heart) and sitting upon that, made it (as Chrysologus speaks) a chair
of celestial doctrine, and out of it preached the first part of my text,
Christ is risen from the dead, upon which the Apostle paraphrasing, says, is
become the first fruits of them that slept: Christ is risen from the dead,
there is the letter of our Creed, and is become the first fruits of them that
slept, there is, as it were, the flourishing about it, or if musical terms
sound sweeter in your ears, here is 1 Planus cantus, or the ground, Christ. 2
Discantus, or the division, is become the first fruits of them that slept.


The notes in the descant must answer those in the planus cantus, so they do
here: The first fruits to Christ: Is become to is risen: Them that slept to the
dead.


The ditty has three parts or sentences: 1 The doctrine of resurrection is
certain, for Christ is risen. 2 The prerogative of Christ is singular, is
become the first fruits. 3 The condition of the dead is happy, they are them
that slept, and rest now from their labors.


Now seems here to have more of the Conjunction than of the Adverbe, and to
be rather a particle of connection, than a note of time. For Christ was not
newly risen when Saint Paul wrote this Epistle, but many years before. The
proper and precise (Now) of Christ's resurrection, when he might have been
said to be now or new risen, was the third day after his passion, being the
first day of the week. Whence I observe the agreement of the time with the
truth, not in substance only, but in circumstance also. The types were the
Paschall Lamb, and the first fruits. Now as Christ our passover was slain the
very day in which the Paschall Lamb was to be killed, so he being also the
first fruits (ver. 23.) rose again the very day in which the first fruits were
by the law to be offered. Saint Bern sermon. in domin. Pasch.
Bernard a little varieth the note, yet makes good harmony. On the sixth day
on which he made man he redeemed him; the next day, being the Jewish sabbath,
he kept his sabbath rest in the grave; the third day, which was the first of
the weeke-dayes, he appeared, The first fruits of them that slept. Of which day
I need say no more to kindle your devotions, and stir up your religious
affections, than Sermon. de resur.
Maximus Taurinensis has long ago in his meditations piously ejaculated. A
blessed day, first discovering unto us the light, not of this world but of the
world to come; far happier than that day in which man first saw the light of
the sun. For on that day man was made to travel, on this day to rest; on
that day he was sentenced to death, on this day freed from fear of death; on
that day the sun arose upon the just and unjust, this day the sun of
righteousness rose only upon the just; (illius diei splendour etiam sepulchra
illuminat) that day shined only upon the living, this also upon the dead, as it
is written, Awake thou that sleep, and stand up from the dead, and Christ
shall give thee light.

Christ, l. 4. divin. instit.
Lactantius interprets the King, Unctus nomen est imperii, anointed is the
name of sovereign majesty. Saint Tract. 2. in Johan. Christus sacramenti nomen
est, quomodo si dicatur sacerdos.
Austine expounds it a Priest, others a Prophet; for Prophets were also
anointed. Saint Bernard alluding to this name, makes Christ a tender
Chirurgian, curing our wounds, non ustione sed unctione, not by lancing or
searing, but by anointing and plastering. The Heathen in Tertullians time
expounded it, Tertul in apologet.
bonum and benignum, good and bountiful, and ne sic quidem male, and not
amiss, says he, if we regard the sense and application of that attribute to
our Savior. For (...) is indeed (...) kind, and gracious, and profitable to
man, because Phil. 1.21.
in life and death advantage: but amiss if we respect the derivation. For
Christ is derived from (...) ungo, and answers to the Hebrew Messiah, of
(...), signifying to anoint, and peculiarly it designeth the Son of God and
Savior of the world. For albeit others were anointed besides Christ, and
called the Lords anointed, yet Christ alone was (...) the Christ: 1 (...). In
verity. 2 (...). After a singular manner.
1 In verity or truth: for all Kings and Priests that were anointed before him
were but types of him, and that in part, how holy soever they were; he is the
only true Christ anointed and appointed by God to save lost man.

2 (...), According to excellency, or after a singular manner, he is the
Christ: 1 Others were anointed by men, he immediately by God. Psalm. 45.7.
God even thy God has anointed thee. 2 They with a less measure of graces, he
with a greater, incomparably greater, with oil of gladness above thy
fellows. 3 They to bear one office, or two at the most, he to bear three.
Melchisedech was a King and a Priest, but no Prophet: Samuel a Prophet and a
Priest, but no King: David a King and a Prophet, but no Priest: Christ was all
three, a Priestly King, as Melchisedeck, a Kingly Prophet, as David, and a
Prophetical Priest, as Samuel. I conceive the Apostle here made choice of this
name Christ above others, because it best fitted his purpose, and employed some
cause of his resurrection. For as anointing or embalming dead corpses keeps
them from putrefying; so Christ by the divine unction was preserved from
corrupting in the grave: because there was no corruption in his soul, his body
could not corrupt, or at least God would not suffer it, as the Prophet
speaks, Psalm. 16.10.
thou will not suffer thy holy One to see corruption. Now if his body must not
be left, nor corrupt in the grave, because it was Act. 2.24.
impossible for him to be held with the sorrows of death, he must undoubtedly
have risen again, as it follows:

Is risen. In the original it is (...) raised (viz.) by the right hand of his
Father; elsewhere (...) he is risen of himself: neither is there yet any
contradiction. For the Father and the Son are one in nature, and consequently
the power of the Father who is God, is the power of the Son, who is one God
with him. Id resurgit quod prius cecidit, that is properly said to be raised,
or rise again, which before fell, and that is the body, which is therefore
called in Hebrew (...) from (...) in Greek (...), in latin cadaver a cado.

Christ's resurrection then, or resuscitation from the dead, must be the
enliving his dead corpse, and lifting it up, and bringing it up out of the dark
sepulcher into the light, which is a kind of second birth, and not unlike to
his first. For as that was his proceeding out of the Virgins womb; so this was
out of a Virgin tomb; the difference was only in this, as Petrus Chrysolog.
sermon. pasch. de resur. ser. 14.
Chrysologus acutely has observed, the womb of the virgin conceived Christ
quick, and accordingly brought him forth alive; the womb of the earth
conceived him dead, but brought him forth quick: uteri nova forma concepit
mortuum, parit vivum.

As we may behold the feature of a man's face either in the countenance it
self, or in a glass set before it, or in a picture drawn by it: so we may
contemplate the resurrection, either in the prophecies and types of the old
law, as in glasses, or in the hystory of the new, as it were in the face it
self, or in our spiritual resurrection from dead works, as in the picture. A
glass shows the lineaments and proportion of a man, but at a distance; so
we may see Christ in the predictions, visions, and figures of the Old
Testament, as so many glasses, but at a distance, according to the words of
that Seer, Number. 24.17.
I shall see him, but not near. So Hosea saw him insulting over death and
hell, and menacing them; Hos. 13.14.
O death I will be thy death: so Esaias saw him risen from the dead, and
speaking to him said, Es. 26.19.
Thy dead shall live, with my body shall they rise: awake and sing ye that sit
in dust.

So David in the Spirit saw the day of the resurrection, and exceedingly
rejoiced at it, saying, Psalm. 16.9.
my heart was glad, my glory rejoiced, my flesh also shall rest in hope. For
thou will not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy holy One to see
corruption. So Adam saw him conquering death, and triumphing over him that had
the power of death, to wit, the Devil (though more obscurely, because at the
farthest distance) in the promise, Genesis 3.15.
it shall break thy head, and thou shall break his heel, the death and
resurrection of Christ are mystically involved. As the Poets fabled that
Achilles after his Mother Thetis held him by the heel, and dipped the rest of
his body into the sea, could be hurt in no part but his heel: so in a divine
sense it may be said of our Savior, that he could be wounded by Satan no
where but in his heel, that is, in the lowest part of his humane nature, his
flesh. This the serpent stung at his death, but in his resurrection he bruised
the head thereof. The Devil, says Greg. Nyssen. de resurrect. ser. 1. (...).
Nyssen, in his sermon upon the resurrection, going about to catch, was caught;
for catching at the bait of Christ's flesh, he was caught fast himself, and
wounded by the hook of his divine nature. Besides these predictions and
promises, we have in the Old Testament the figure of our Lords resurrection in
Adam, a type in the escape goat, a sign or emblem in Jonas, and a vision in
Ezekiel. The figure may be thus expounded, As Adam rose out of his dead sleep
in which Eve was formed out of his ribbe; so Christ after his slumber of death
on the cross, in which his spouse the Church was formed out of his side (as
has been said) awoke again. The type may be thus exemplified: as the
scapegoate came near to death, being within the cast of a lot to it, and yet
avoiding it, was presented alive to God to make an atonement; so Christ who
seemed to have been conquered by death, and swallowed up of the grave, lying
there three days and three nights, yet escaped it, and was presented on Easter
day to his Father alive, to make an atonement for all his brethren. To the
emblem of Jonas Christ himself gives the word or Motto: Mat. 12.40.
As Jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly, so shall the
son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. After
three days Jonas came out of the bowels of the whale, Christ out of the heart
of the earth. The vision of Ezekiel is so clear, that he that runs may see
in it a praeludium of the resurrection.

Ezekiel 37.7, 8, 9, 10.
The Prophet saw in a valley a number of dry bones moving one to the other; and
suddenly they were tied with sinews, and covered with flesh, and the wind
breathed into them the breath of life, and they stood up like an army.

We have viewed the resurrection in the prophecies and figures of the Old
Testament, as so many several glasses: let us now contemplate it in the
history of the New, as it were in the face it self.

1 Early in the morning, while it was yet dark, the Angel removed the stone,
that so Mary and the Apostles might look into the sepulcher: and unless the
angel of the covenant remove the stone from our hearts, we can never look
into Christ's sepulcher with an eye of faith, nor undoubtedly believe the
resurrection.

2 Peter and John made have to the sepulcher, but they stayed not there; Mary
abides there, she therefore sees a vision of Angels, the one standing at the
head, the other at the feet where Jesus had lain: either to signify that the
Angels of God attend as well on Christ's feet, the lowest members of his
mystical body, as on his head, that is, the chiefest in the Church: or that
the angels smell a sweet savor from our works of charity, and therefore the
one sat at the head, the other at the feet where Mary had anointed our Lord.

3 A third Angel, whereof mention is made in the Gospel of Saint Mar. 16.5.
Mark, sitting on the right side appeared like a young man, to signify that
in the resurrection our age shall be renewed, and our bodies shall be in
their full strenghth and vigor: his raiment shined like lightning, to represent
the clarity and splendor of our bodies, that after death shall be made
conformable to Christ's glorious body.

4 Mary Magdalene has the honor first to see our Savior, and to be the
first Preacher of the resurrection, to the everlasting comfort of all true
Penitents: and as by the woman death came first, so the first news of life
from death was brought by a woman.

5 Till Christ called Mary by name she knew him not, but supposed him to have
been the Gardener (who indeed is the Planter of the celestial Paradise:)
neither can we know Christ, till by a special and particular vocation he make
himself known to us.

6 Christ appeared first to single witnesses, as Mary apart, and Peter apart,
and James apart; then to double, Cleophas and that other disciple; afterward
to the eleven Apostles; and last of all to more than 500. brethren at once. If
Mary's testimony might be excepted at because she was but a woman, what can
they say to Saint Peter? what to Saint James, to whom Christ vouchsafed to show
himself in particular? If they except against them as single witnesses, what
will they say to Cleophas and Saint Luke, two contests of one and the self
same apparition? If their paucity be cavelled at, what will they say to the
eleven Apostles? or to more than five hundred brethren that saw him all at one
time? nay, what to more than five millions of Confessors and Martyrs, signing
the truth of it with their blood, and showing the power of it as well by the
wonders which they wrought in his name, as the invincible patience wherewith
they endured all sorts of torments, and death it self for his name? I might
produce the testimony of Josephus the learned Jew, and tell you of Paschasinus
his holy Well, that fills of his own accord every Easter day; and the annual
rising of certain bodies of Martyrs in the sands of Egypt, and likewise of a
Phoenix in the days of Tyberius, much about the time of our Lords
resurrection, rising out of her own ashes.

Lactant. in Poem.
Ipsa sibi proles suus and pater and suus haeres,
Nutrix ipsa sui, semper alumna sibi
Ipsa quidem, sed non eadem, quia and ipsa, nec ipsa
Eternam vitam mortis adepta bono.
But because the authors of these relations and observations are not beyond
exception, I will rather conclude this point with an argument of Saint De
civit. Dei l. 22. c. 5. Haec duo incredibilia, scil. resurrectionem nostri
corporis, and rem ^am incredibilem mundum esse crediturum, idem dominus
antequam vel unum horu^ fieret, ambo futura esse praedixit, unum duorum
incredibilium jam factum videmus, ut quod erat incredibile crede^et mundus,
curid quod reliquum est desperatur?
Austines, to which our own undoubted experience gives much strength. The same
Spirit of God, says he, which foretold the resurrection of Christ, foretold
also that the doctrine thereof should be publicly professed and believed in
the world; and the one was altogether as unlikely as the other. But the latter
we see in all ages since Christ's death, and at this day accomplished in the
celebration of this feast; why then should any man doubt of the former? The
Apostles saw the head living, but not the mystical body the Catholic Church
of all places and ages. We have read in the histories of all ages since Christ,
and at this day see the Catholic Church spread over the whole face of the
earth, which is Christ's body, how can we then but believe the head to be
living which conveigheth life to all the members? I have set before you the
glass of the resurrection in the figures of predictions of the Old Testament,
and the face it self in the history of the New: may it please you now to cast
a glance of your eye upon the Image or picture thereof, in our rising from the
death of sin to the life of grace. All Christ's actions and passions, as they
are meritorious for us, so they are some way exemplary unto us: and as none can
be assured of the benefit of Christ's birth unless he be borne again by
water and the Spirit, nor of his death unless he be dead to sin, nor of
his burial unless he have buried his old Adam; so neither of his
resurrection unless he be risen from dead works, and continually walks in
newness of life. See you how the material colors in a glass window, when
the sunbeams pass through it, produce the like colors, but less material
(and therefore called by the Philosophers intentionales and spiritales) on the
next wall? no otherwise does the corporal resurrection of Christ produce in
all true believers a representation thereof in their spiritual, which Saint
John calls Apoc. 20.5.
the first resurrection: Saint Paul, Heb. 6.1.
repentance from dead works. Sins, especially heinous and grievous,
proceeding from an evil habit, are called dead works, and such sinners dead
men, because they are deprived of the life of God, have no sense of true
Religion, they see not Gods works, they hear not his Word, they savor not
the things of God, they feel no prick of conscience, they breath not out holy
prayers to God, nor move toward heaven in their desires, but lie rotting in
their own filthiness and corruption. The causes which moved the Jews so much
to abhor dead corpses, ought to be more prevalent with us carefully to shun
and avoid those that are spiritually dead in sins and transgressions: they
were four; 1 Pollution. 2 Horror. 3 Stench. 4 Haunting with evil spirits.


1 Pollution. That which touched a dead corpse was by the law unclean; neither
can any come nigh these men, much less embrace them in their bosom, without
moral pollution, and taking infection in their souls from them.

2 Horror. Nothing so ghastly as the sight of a dead corpse, the
representation whereof oft-times in the Theater appalleth not only the
spectatours but also the actours: and yet this sight is not so dreadful to the
carnal man, as the sight of those that are spiritually dead (I speak of
foul, notorious, and scandalous offenders) to them that fear God. Saint John
would not stay in the same bath with Cerinthus; and certainly it is a most
fearful thing to be under the same roof with blasphemous heretics, and
profane persons who have no fear of God before their eyes.

3 Stench. The smell of a carcass is not so offensive to the nostrils, as the
stench of gluttony, drunkenness, and uncleanness, in which wicked men wallow,
is loathsome to God and all good men.

4 Haunting with evil spirits. We read in scriptures that the men that were
possessed of the devil came Mat. 8.28.
out of the tombs and graves: and we find by daily experience the like of
these, rather carcasses than men, that the devil hankereth about them, and
enters into their heart, as he did into Judas, filling them with all
wickedness and uncleanness. After they have exhausted their bodies with
incontinency, their estate with riotous living; and have lost, first their
conscience, and after their credit, they fall into the deepest melancholy, upon
which Satan works, and puts them into desperate courses. Psalm. 73.19.
O how suddenly do they consume, perish, and come to a fearful end! Me
thinks I hear some say, we heard of places haunted by evil spirits in time
of popery, are there now any such? not such as then were, solitary houses,
ruined palaces or Churches, in which fearful noyses are said to have been
heard, and walking spirits to have been met. For at the thunder of the Gospel
Satan fell like lightning from heaven, and has left those his old holds; but
places of a contrary condition, such where is the greatest concourse of people,
I mean profane Theaters, disorderly Tavernes, Alehouses, places of gaming and
lewdness, yea prisons also which were intended for the restraint of
wickedness, and punishment of vice, are made refuges of Malefactors, and
schools of all impiety and wickedness: Quis custodes custodiet ipsos?

As in the hot sands of Africa, where wild beasts of diverse sorts meet to
drink, strange monsters are begotten, which gave occasion to that proverb,
Eras. Adag.
Semper Africa aliquid apportat novi, etc. so in the places of moist meetings
monstrous sins are begotten, monstrous oaths, monstrous blasphemies,
monstrous murders, monstrous uncleanness; here Popery is familiarly broacht,
nay Atheism freely vented, Gods creatures abused, his Sabbath profaned, the
actions of the State censured, the watchful Magigistrates, and the zealous
Ministers of the Gospel, and all that make profession of Religion nicknamed,
jeared, and made a parable of reproach: here profane Music and impure Songs
are played and sung, even in time of divine Service; here is no difference of
days holy or common, nay no difference of day or night, I had almost said nay
nor of Sexes. If the hands of the religious Magistrates be not strengthened,
and their zeal stirred up to take some course to abate the incredible number,
and reform the unsufferable abuses of these sinks of all impurity, especially
about the skirts and suburbs of the city, we have cause to fear a worse fire
than that which lately affrighted us, falling in that place where it might be
as a dreadful beacon to warn both City, Borough, and Suburbs; I mean such a
fire as fell upon Sodom and Gomorrha. Cause. in Polyhist. symb.
Polycritus writes of a Lake of troubled water in Sicily, quam si quis
ingrediatur in latum extenditur, into which the deeper a man wadeth the larger
it does extend it self. Such a lake my discourse is fallen into, the water is
foul and troubled, and the deeper I sink into it, the more it enlarges it
self: and lest it should overflow the banks of the allotted time, I will
suddenly leap out of it into my second part, which is Christ's prerogative,
whereby he is become the first fruits of them that slept.

We have surveyed the ground, let us now take a sample of the fruits; in the
spreading whereof abroad I must handle two things: 1 The reference. 2 The
inference.


1 The reference is to Leviticus 23.10. When you reap the harvest, you shall
bring in a sheafe of the first fruits of the harvest unto the Priest (ver. 7.)
and he shall wave it. And to Exodus 34.22. You shall observe the feast of weeks,
the feast of the first fruits of wheat harvest. Now let us set the truth to the
type. As the first fruits were reapt in the harvest, when the corn was ripe,
so Christ was cut off by death in his ripe age.

2 As the sheafe that was offered was shaken before; so there was an Mat. 28.2.
earthquake at Christ's lifting out of the grave.

3 As the sheafe was offered, the morrow after the Sabbath; so Christ the first
day of the week after the Sabbath was presented alive to his Father at his
resurrection. Lastly, as there was a distance of time between the first fruits
which were offered on Easter day, and those that were offered at the day of
Pentecost; so there is a distance of time between Christ's rising from the dead,
which was 1600. years ago, and ours which shall be at the last day. Thus much
for the reference; now to the inference, which is twofold: 1 Christ's
prerogative, in that he is the first fruits. 2 The Saints communion with him,
in that they are of the heap.


1 Christ's prerogative, Joh. 3.31.
He that is in heaven is above all, for Mat. 28.18.
to him is given all power in heaven and earth, and Phil. 2.9.
a name above all names, Ephesians. 1.22.
he is the head of the Church, and Ephesians. 5.23.
Savior of the body, he is the first Heb. 1 6.
begotten of the Father, Mat. 1.25.
first borne of his Mother, the first Col. 1.18. Rev. 1.5.
begotten of the dead, Col. 1.15.
first borne of every creature. Therefore as Quiros strongly concludes in every
order, both of creation and regeneration, of nature and grace, of things
visible and invisible, he has the pre-eminence among all: let him have the
precedence in our love and affections, let us not set any thing above him on
earth, who has the first place in heaven. If he be the head of men and
Angels, let the knees of all in heaven, in earth, and under the earth, bow to
him: if he be the bright morning star, let the eye of our faith be early
upon him: if he be Apoc. 22.16.
Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, let him be first in our thoughts,
and last in our memory; Apoc. 1.8.
let us begin our prayers in his name, and end them in his merits. (...). Prima
dicta mihi, summa dicende Camena.

If he be the first fruits, Reshith bicorre, the first fruits of the first
fruits, let all the sheaves do homage to him, let us sanctify him in our
minds, let us offer him the first fruits of our hearts, the first fruits of our
lips, the first fruits of our hands, the first fruits of the earth, the first
fruits of our thoughts, the first fruits of our desires, the first fruits of
our prayers, the first fruits of our labors, the first fruits of our
substance, so will he esteem us Jam. 1.18.
the first fruits of his creatures, and we shall receive the Romans 8.23.
first fruits of the spirit here in our regeneration, and the whole harvest
hereafter in our glorification, as our holy brethren that are fallen asleep, in
soul have received already; who rest from their labors, and their works
follow them, and here you may see them. I may say of them as Isaac said of
Jacob, Genesis 27. The smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord
has blessed. And behold here as in a corn field, Allude to the Hosp tall
children in blew coats.
blew flowers intermingled.

[Here the Preacher read the Catalogue printed, of all the poor relieved in
the Hospitals of the City, which follows.]

Children kept and maintained at this present at the charges of Christ's
Hospital, in the said house, in diverse places of this city, and suburbs, and
with sundry nurses in the country, 905 Which is a far greater number than
has hitherto been since the foundation. The names of all which are registered
in the books kept in Christ's Hospital, there to be seen from what parishes,
and by what means they have been from time to time admitted. Children put
forth apprentices, discharged, and dead this year, 69 There has been cured
this year last past at the charges of Saint Bartholomews Hospital, of
soldiers and other diseased people, to the number of 832 All which were
relieved with money and other necessaries at their departure. Buried this
year, after much charges in their sickness, 121 Remaining under cure at this
present, at the charge of the said Hospital, 262 There has been cured this
year last past at the charges of Saint Thomas Hospital, of soldiers, and
other diseased people, 731 All which were relieved with money and other
necessaries at their departure. Buried out of the said Hospital this year,
200 Remaining under cure at this present, 304 There has been brought into the
Hospital of Bridewell (for this year past) of wandering soldiers, and vagrant
persons, to the number of 1578 Of which number many have been chargeable for
the time of their being there; which cannot be avoided by reason of their
misery, nor passed away without charge. There is maintained and kept in the
said Hospital, in arts and occupations, and other works and labors,
Apprentices taken up out of diverse parishes and streets of this City, to the
number of 200
I have made an end of the Catalogue, but you must not make an end of your good
works: I have set before you a fair copy, you must write after it, or else
this schedule will prove a handwriting against you at the day of judgment,
who have had not only many most forcible exhortations to good works in this
place, but such noble and royal presidents as you see, and yet have not been
bettered by them. You cannot want pitiful objects of mercy: your pious charity
has daily Orators, the tears of orphans, the sighs of widows, the groans
of the sick, and the lamentable cries of prisoners and captives. Neither is it
sufficient for you now and then to drop upon the dry and thirsty ground, you
must stillare pluviam liberalissimam, you must power down golden showers to
refresh Gods inheritance. To whom much is given, much shall be required of
him. In other seizements you give as you are in the Kings books; but
contrariwise, you are in Gods books, and he valueth you as you give to pious
and charitable uses. And let me entreat you for the love of your Redeemer from
everlasting thraldom, to open your hands toward the redemption of many
hundreds of our contrymen, whose bodies are in captivity under Turks and
Infidels, their wives and children in misery at home, and it is to be feared,
their souls in worse case. Next to the redemption of these spiritual Temples
of the holy Ghost, I commend unto you the reparation and beautifying of his
material Temple: you have most decently and beautifully adorned and trimmed
the daughters of Zion, the lesser and later built Churches in this City, let
not your piety be less to the Mother Church, dedicated to the most public
and solemn worship of God, where you are fed with the finest flower of wheat,
and drink of the purest juice of the grape, and in the fullest manner partake
of the communion of Saints; which was the second inference I made from the
attribute of Christ in my text, whereby he is styled Primitiae dormientium,
The first fruits of them that slept.

2 The second inference from the attribute here mentioned ( the first fruits
of, etc.) is the communion of the faithful with Christ, both in sanctification
and glorification; for the further manifestation whereof it will be requisite
to specify whereof Christ is the first fruits, viz. 1 Coeli, for he is the
first begotten of his Father. 2 Uteri, for he was the Virgins first borne. 3
Sepulchri, for he is the first fruits of them that slept.


In all three the faithful partake with him after a sort.

1 In that he is Primitiae coeli, the first fruits of heaven. For as he is
the natural son of God, so are we the adopted sons of God, and by his
spirit made 2 Pet. 1.4.
partakers of the divine nature: as he is the first borne of heaven, Heb.
12.23.
so we are also of the general assembly and Church of the first borne which
are written in heaven.

2 In that he is Primitiae uteri virginei, the first fruits of a virgins womb.
For as Christ was borne of a virgin Mother, so the Christian Church our Mother
is continually in childbearing, and yet remains still a virgin.

3 Most properly do we partake with him in that he is Primitiae sepulchri;
for he is Joh. 12.24.
that corn of wheat Saint John speaks of, which was sown at his death,
dug deep into the earth at his burial, sprang up again at his
resurrection, and now is become the first fruits of them that slept: in like
manner we are sown at our death, dug deep into the earth at our burial,
and shall spring up again at the last resurrection, and be offered as Apoc.
14.4.
first fruits unto God and the Lamb. Where the first fruits are taken out,
there must needs be a lump or heap out of which they are taken. Calvin in
hunc locum.
In primitiis totius anni proventus consecrabatur, in the first fruits the
whole crop of the year was hallowed; so in Christ, who is our first fruits,
all true believers are sanctified, as those words of our Savior in that most
divine prayer to his Father recorded import, Joh. 17.19.
for their sakes I sanctify my self, that they also might be sanctified
through the truth.

If Christ sanctified himself for us, shall not we endeavor as he enableth
us by his grace, to sanctify our selves also for him? If he impart this his
dignity to us, and makes us Jam. 1.18.
the first fruits of his creatures, let us dedicate our selves unto him: let us
be given to him, as 1 Samuel 1.28.
Samuel was, all the days of our lives. He has chosen us to be (mark I
beseech you what) fruits, not blossoms, not leaves; fruits I say, not stalks,
not empty ears, like those who make a bare profession of the truth, and all
their religion is in their ears, bearing no fruit at all, or in no degree
answerable to their holiest profession. If God has made us fruits, let us not
make our selves rank weeds by heresy, or filthy dung by a corrupt life. After
the first fruits are carried away out of the field, the rest of the shockes or
sheafes follow of course; Theod. in hunc locum.
primitias universa massa sequitur: Christ the first fruits is carried away
long since out of the field of this world, into the celestial barn. A barn
far more stately, beautiful, and glorious than any Princes palace upon
earth; and when the harvest shall come, which is Mat. 13.39.
the end of the world, we shall be carried thither also every one in his own
order: the first fruits is Christ, after they that are Christ's at his coming,
ver. 23.

Before I can proceed, according to my desire and your expectation, to the
period of my discourse, and end of all men's course, viz. death, called here
sleep, I must remove six rubbes that lie in my way. For we read of three
dead men raised in the Old Testament, and as many in the New, before Christ
himself rose: how then is he the first fruits of them that slept?

1 I will offer to your consideration many solutions of this doubt, that you
may take your choice. Saint Jerome gives but a touch at it, yet because it is
upon the right string it is worth your hearing: Christus primus surrexit in
incorruptione; the rest before they were raised began at least to corrupt; it
is said of Lazarus expressly, that he Joh. 11.39.
stanke, but God suffered not his holy One to see corruption: they rose in
their natural and corruptible bodies, Christ in an incorruptible, and as the
Apostle calls it, a spiritual body, ver 44.

2 That which Cornelius A lapide answers is considerable, that though Christ
were not primus tempore, the first that rose in time, yet that he was primus in
intention Dei, the first in Gods intention.

3 Aquinas comes yet nearer the matter, Christus primus sua virtute resurrexit,
Christ was the first that rose himself by his own power; they before Christ
were raised by others. If any thing be yet lacking, S. Bernard and Beza will
supply it; alii suscitati sunt mortui, sed iterum morituri; other dead were
raised, but dyed again, like drowned men which rise up twice or thrice from
under water, but sink again to the bottom: Christus simul resurrexit, and
aeternam beatamque vitam recepit, Christ at once rose, and obtained an eternal
and blessed life. Romans 6.9.
Christ being risen from the dead dies no more, death has no more power over
him.

Whereunto (...) may be added, that others rose as private men, Christ as a
public person, and the cause of all other men's rising, either univocall, as of
all the Elect, who rise as he did to happy eternity; or equivocall, as of the
reprobates, who are raised to eternal misery. They who rose before Christ were
either singular types of him, or as common sheafes of the heap; Christ was the
first that ever rose in the nature and quality of the first fruits, to
sanctify the whole harvest of the dead in him, who are here called, Them that
slept.

Aristot. lib. de mirabil. auscult.
Aristotle writes of certain serpents in Mesopotamia, which do great
mischief to strangers, but do no hurt at all to the inhabitants: such is
death, it has power to sting those that are strangers and aliens from the
commonwealth of Israel, it hurts not at all the natural Israelites, which
are fellow-citizens with the Saints of the household of faith. Those which are
without God in the world, and without Christ, though within the visible Church,
have cause to fear death; because, like the Phalangium in Strab. l. 2. geog.
(...).
Strabo, it stings them to death in such sort, that they dye either laughing or
mad; that is, either making a jest of judgment, and hell, and the life to
come, or distracted in some fearful fit of desparation. And as Diogenes when
he felt himself falling into a slumber a little before his death, said
pleasantly, Eras. apoph. Diog.
Frater me mox est traditurus fratri suo; one brother is now delivering me to
the other (he meant sleep to death:) so it is most true of these scoffers at
God and all religion, dying impenitently, that their temporal death delivers
them over to eternal death; the elder death to the younger (but longer liver,)
the first death to the Ubi mors vivit, and finis incipit. Greg. Morah. in Job.
second: but upon those who are in Christ, and have part in the first
resurrection, the second death has no power, and in that regard the first
death is not terrible unto them: nay, so far is it from being terrible, that
even lying on their deathbeds they insult both upon death and the grave with
holy sarcasmes. 1 Cor. 15.55.
O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory? (...).

Graec. liturg.
The immortal entered into a single combat with death on the cross, and gave
death a death wound, even by his death: and now death is no more death to the
godly, but a sleep; Mat. 9.24.
The damsel is not dead, but asleep; our friend Lazarus is Joh. 11.12.
but asleep. Stephen though he came to his end by a violent means, yet it is
said of him that Act. 7.60.
he fell asleep. And I would not have you ignorant brethren, says S. Paul,
concerning them which are 1 Thessalonians. 4.14.
asleep: and so in my text, they who before were called the dead, now after the
mention of Christ's resurrection, are termed, Them that slept.

Which words are not so to be understood, as if their souls slept with their
bodies till the day of judgment. That is a drowsy heresy, out of which
Calvin shakes some in his time, whom he calls by the right name
Soule-all-night-sleepers.
Psychopamychistas: but in three other respects,

1 Because they rest from their toylesome labors, as those that sleep we say
are at their ease.

2 Because they neither mind, nor at all meddle with any affairs of this life
either good or bad, as those that are fast asleep, Hom. Il. 2.
(...), for the time, neither think nor often so much as dream of any thing
in the world.

3 Because they shall certainly be awaked by the shrill sound of the last
Trumpet; as those that sleep at night are awaked again in the morning by the
Weytes your City music.

Do you believe all these things? I know you do. Why do you then take on in
such grievous manner when your friends are taken away from you by corporal
death? Why do you make their deathbeds swim with your tears? non
amisistis, sed praemisistis; you have not lost them, but sent them to bed
before you: they are but asleep, they shall awake again; they are but as
seed sown in the earth, they shall rise out of it again.

Bern. in Cant. Occidit me Deus cum succidit Gervasium meum.
I know that where hearts have bin knit together, they cannot be rent asunder
without exceeding great pain and unexpressible grief: neither do I find fault
with natural affection; much less condemn the Christian compassion of those
who Romans 12.15.
weep with them that weep. It is for a Stoicke, or rather a stock, to be
without all sympathy of others sorrow, or sense of his own loss: Cic. pro
dom. ad Pont.
eam animi duritiam sicut corporis, quod cum uritur non sentit, stuporem potius
quam virtutem puto. Our Lord and Master reads us another lesson, who himself
Joh. 11.35.
wept for Lazarus: and whosoever reads (if yet for tears he be able) David's
lamentation for Jonathan; Saint Ambroses for Satyrus; Nyssens for Saint Basil;
Nazianzens for Gorgonia; Augustines for Nebridius; and Bernards for Gervasius,
will find that the heat of love is contrary to all other. For all other
dries, but this the greater it is in the heart the moister the eyes are. Yet
love must not exceed proportion, nor tears measure; Hieron. in epitaph.
Paulae.
grandis in suos pietas impietas est apud Deum. What Seneca speaks of words,
may be a good rule in these tears, still are volo non currere; let them drop
like precious water out of a Lymbecke, not run like common water out of a
spout: Horat. carm. l. 2 ed. 20.
Absint inani funere naeniae,
Luctusque turpes, and querimoniae:
Compesce clamorem.


Demang in Hebrew, signifying a tear, has great affinity with Demama,
signifying silence, to teach us that our tears ought to be silent, not
querulous or clamorous. Let nature have her course, but let religion set bounds
to it. Horat. l. 2. carm ed. 9.
Ne semper urge flebilibus modis
Mysten ademptum.


Let us water our plants, but not drown them, as those that mourn without
hope. Joseph loved his Father Jacob better than the Egyptians, yet his tears
were but the tithes of theirs; for he mourned but Genesis 50.3.
seven days, but they seventy. Rachel, though otherwise a good woman, yet in
this was too womanish and wayward, that she would not be comforted; neither
is her reason good nor true, if we take it as the words sound, because they
are not; for we know they are, and living too, all live to God: we know where
they are that dye in the Lord, with Christ in Paradise; we know what manner of
dwellings they have, tabernacles not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;
we know of what congregation they are, of the congregation of the first borne,
and the spirits of just men made perfect: we know what they do, they follow
the lamb wheresoever he goes; we know what they say also, they cease not to
cry day and night, Holy, holy, holy, etc. lastly, we know what they sing,
Halelujah.

Wherefore as Xenophon when news was brought him (as he was sacrificing) of
his sons death, put off the crown he had on his head, and gave vent to his
sorrows at his eyes; but after he understood that he dyed valiantly, and
worthy such a Father, put on his crown again, and finished his sacrifice: so
when news shall be brought unto us of the death of our dearest friends, let
us first put off our crown of joy, and let nature and love melt us into
tears; but when we hear again that they dyed penitently and religiously,
with hope full of immortality: let us put on our crown again, and comfort
ourselves, and finish our Christian course with joy, as those religious people
did, of whom Saint Austine speaks, putting himself among them; Aug. ser. 35.
de diverse.
Contristamur in nostrorum mortibus necessitate amittendi, sed cum spe
recipiendi, inde angimur, hinc consolamur, inde infirmitas afficit, hinc fides
reficit, inde dolet humana conditio, hinc sanat divina promissio: the
consideration of the loss of our friends cutteth us, but the hope of receiving
them again heals us.

And now at the length to release your long captivated attention, I will speak
but one word of admonition to you concerning your own end, and so an end. Is
death nothing but a sleep? why then are you so much scared at the mention or
thought of it? When the Prophets of God, or some other your dearest friends
deal faithfully with you, telling you there is no way but one, and advising
you to set your house in order, for you must dye and cannot live; why do you
fetch many a deep sigh, turn to the wall and mourn like a dove, or chatter
like a crane? why do you not rather struggle with your own infirmity, and
with resolute Hilarion, even chide out your souls hankering at the door of
your lips: Egredere, quid times? egredere anima mea, quid dubitas? sexaginta
prope annis servisti Christo, and mortem times? Go out my soul, why art thou
afraid? go out, why make thou any difficulty? thou have served Christ well
nigh sixty years, and do thou now fear death? You will hardly find any
little child, much less man, that is afraid to go to bed; nay travelers
after a tedious journey in bitter weather, are not content to pull off their
clothes, they tear them for haste to get into their soft and warm beds: When
our day is spent, and we are come to our journeyes end, why do we not, as it
were, pull off our clothes, by stripping ourselves of worldly cares and
businesses, and settle our selves to sleep in Jesus, and breathe out our
souls between his arms? Plato when he died had the book of Sophronius the
Musician under his pillow. When we lie on our death bed let us have under our
pillow to support us, not the book of Sophronius the Musician, but the books
of the sweet singers of Israel, David and Solomon, and the rest of the inspired
Writers: so shall we be sure that God will make our beds in our sickness,
and we shall sweetly fall into our last sleep, as did the most religious
Matron Paula, who when some about her, as she was now drawing on, read to her
the second of Canticles; so soon as she heard the Bridegroom calling, Surge
speciosa mea, surge columba mea, veni: Arise my Love, arise my Dove, arise my
Fair one, and come away, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone: she
answered as it there follows; the flowers appear in the earth, the time of
pruning, or (as it is in our translation) the time of singing is at hand. With
which word she made an end of her life, and I will of my Sermon; committing
you, as she did her soul, to God; beseeching him who has taught us the
doctrine of the resurrection by his word, to accomplish it in us by his Spirit,
that having part in the grace of the first resurrection here, we may hereafter
participate in the glory of the second through JESUS CHRIST. Cui, etc.

THE TRUE ZEALOT. A Sermon preached at the Archbishops visitation in Saint
Dunstans. THE FOURTEENTH SERMON.
JOHN 2.17. The zeal of thine house has eaten me up.


THe parcel of Scripture whence I have taken my text is a sacred sculpture or
Hieroglyphicke, consisting of 1 An emblem or imprese: 2 A motto or word.


The emblem presents to us the Temple with a kind of Fair in it; and a man
(which is the son of man) with a scourge of small cords, driving out all the
buyers and sellers, and pouring down their money, and overthrowing their
tables and stalles. The motto, word or sentence, is that which I have already
spoken in your hearing, viz. The zeal of thine house has eaten me up. The
exemplification of the emblem I commend to him, to whom our Savior has left
his whip to void, and cleanse this temple, and to discipline all sorts of bad
merchants in it. The motto or word belongs properly to them to publish and
proclaim it, whose style is vox clamantium, the voice of Mat. 3.3.
cryers; not the sweet voice of singers to lull men asleep in security, with
melodious streines of time-serving and eare-pleasing Madrigals and Fancies: but
the strong and loud voice of Cryers, to call all men into the Court, and summon
them to the bar of Christ's judgment: he that promises his Apostles and
their successors to give them a Luke 21.15. I will give you a mouth, etc.
mouth, has given me at this time both the mouth and the Motto, the Motto of
the emblem, viz. the words of my text, Zelus domus tuae devoravit me. In the
uttering whereof if ever, now I need to pray that the Lord would Esaias 6.7.
touch my tongue with a coal from his altar; with a coal, that I may speak
warmely of zeal; with a coal from the altar, that I may discourse holily of
his Temple. Saint Homil. 3. Utinam daretur mihi de superno altar, non carbo
unus, sed globus igneus offeratur, qui multam and inveteratam rubiginem possit
excoquere.
Bernard made the like prayer upon the like occasion: O, says he, that there
were given unto me from the altar above, not one coal, but rather a fiery
globe, a heap of coals, to scorch the abuses of the time, and burn out the
inveterate rust of vicious customs. By the light of these coals you may
behold in this Scripture, 1 In David as the type, Christ, 2 In Christ, as the
mirror of perfection, zeal, 3 In zeal as a fire, 1 The flame, 2 The fuel.



The flame, vehement, consuming, or devouring, devoravit.

The fuel sacred, me, me.

No divine virtues or graces like to Christ's affection:

No affection in him like to his zeal:

No zeal like to that which he bare, or rather wherewith he was transported
to his Fathers house, which even eat him up; and may deservedly take up this
golden moment of our most precious time. May it please you therefore, Right,
etc. to suffer your religious ears to be bored at this present with these
sacred nails, or points, which I humbly pray the holy Spirit to fasten in your
hearts: 1 The virtue or affection it self, zeal. 2 The object of this
affection, thy house. 3 The effect of this object, has eaten up. 4 The subject
of this effect, me.
1 In figure, David. 2 In truth, Christ.


(...); and who is sufficient for these things? or able worthily to treat of 1
An affection most ardent, zeal. 2 A place most sacred, thine house. 3 An
effect most powerful, has eaten up. 4 A person most divine, me?


Zeal is derived from (...) to burn, or hizze, as water cast on metal
melted, and it signifies a hot or burning desire, an ardent affection: and
sometimes it is taken

1 For (...), or emulation, which is a commendable desire of attaining unto
another virtue or fame.

2 For (...), or (...), envy, which is a vicious affection, repining at
another fame or fortune.

3 For (...) jealousy, which is an irksome passion arising from love wronged,
at least in opinion. And no other fire we find on natures forge, or the
Philosophers hearth; but on Gods altar there burns another manner of fire,
fed with pure fuel, which like a wax light or taper, yields both a clear
flame and a sweet fume; and this is holy zeal. All things that are cast into
the fire make a smell; but the burning of sweet odors only makes a perfume: so
the hot and fervent 1 Desire of, 2 Intention in, 3 Affection to the best things
only, is zeal.


Fire is the noblest of all the elements, and seated next to the heavens: so
zeal sparkling in the soul is the chief and most heavenly of all spiritual
affections. Some define it to be the fervor, intention, excellency, or
improvement of them all.

Heat 1 In Romans 12.11. Fer^ent in spirit.
devotion, if it exceed becomes zeal. 2 In Col. 4.13.
affection, if it be improved grows to be zeal. 3 In 1 Cor. 14.12.
desire of spiritual gifts, if it be ardent is zeal. 4 In 1 Cor. 7.11.
indignation, or revenge of our selves, if it be vehement, is called by the
Apostle zeal.


Fervent devotion, ardent love, earnest desire, vehement indignation, all are
zeal, or rather are all zeal: for there is a 1 Zeal of good things, which
makes us zealous of Gods gifts. 2 Zeal in good things, which makes us
zealous in Gods service. 3 Zeal for good things, which makes us zealous for
Gods glory.
And answerable to the three operations of fire, which are, to heat, to burn,
to consume: 1 The first heateth us, by kindling a desire of grace. 2 The second
burns, by enflaming our hearts with the love of God. 3 The third consumes,
by drying up the heart, absuming the spirits with grief, and hazzarding our
persons and estates in removing scandals, and reforming abuses and profanations
of God his name, house, or worship, as also revenging wrongs done to his
household and servants.


In sum, zeal is a divine grace grounded upon the knowledge of Gods word,
which according to the direction of spiritual wisdom, quickens and
enflameth all the desires and affections of the soul in the right worship of
the true God; and vehemently and constantly stirs them up to the preserving,
advancing, and vindicating his honor by all lawful means within the compass
of our calling. Rectum sui est judex and obliqui: If you set a straight line or
rule to a crooked figure or body, it will discover all the obliquities in it.
Hang up an artificial pattern by an unskilful draught, and it will show all
the disproportions and deformities in it. Wherefore Aristotle gives this for a
certain (...), or character of a true definition, to notify and discover all
the errors that are, or may be devised about the nature of the thing defined;
which are in this present subject we treat of, sundry and manifold. For as
when there is public notice given of a ring found, with a rich stone set in
it, every one almost that ever was owner of a ring like unto it, especially if
his own be lost, challenges it for his: so all in whose temper, affections
or actions, any natural or spiritual, divine or diabolical, heavenly,
earthly or hellish fire gloweth, challenges the precious coal or carbuncle of
zeal to be theirs. The Choleric and furious, the quarrelsome and
contentious, the malicious and envious, the jealous and suspicious, the
Idolatrous and superstitious, the indiscreet and preposterous, the proud
selfe-admirer, the sacrilegious Church-robber, the presumptuous and exorbitant
zealot, nay the seditious boutefieu and incendiary, all pretend to zeal. But
all these claimers and many more besides, are disproved and disclaimed by the
true definition of zeal: which is, first, a grace, and that distinct from
other; not more graces, or a compound of love and anger, as some teach; or of
love and indignation, as others: for the graces of the spirit, and virtues of
the mind are incoincident. As where diverse candles or torches in a room
concur to enlighten the place, the light of them remains impermixt, as the
Optickes demonstrate by their several shadows: so all the divine graces
conjoyne their luster and virtue to adorn, and beautify the inward man; yet
their nature remains distinct, as their special effects make it evident to a
single and sharp-sighted eye. God was in the bush that burned and consumed not,
yet God was not the bush. The holy Ghost was in the fiery cloven tongues, yet
the holy Ghost was not the tongues. The spirits run along in the arteries
with the purer and refined blood, yet the spirits are not the blood. The fire
insinuates it self into all the parts of melted metal, and to the eye
nothing appears but a torrent of fire, yet the fire is not the metal: in
like manner zeal shines and flameth in devotion, love, godly jealousy,
indignation, and other sanctified desires and affections, it enflameth them as
fire does metal, it stirs and quickens them as the spirits do the blood,
yet zeal is not those passions, neither are all, or any of them zeal;
howsoever the schools, rather out of zeal of knowledge than knowledge of
zeal, have determined the contrary.

2 Secondly, zeal is defined to be, not a moral virtue, but a divine gift or
grace of the Spirit: the Spirit of God is the efficient cause, and the Spirit
of man is the subject; which the Apostle intimates in that phrase, Romans 12.11.
(...), being fervent or zealous in Spirit. This fire, like that of the
Vestals, is kindled from heaven by the beams of the Sun of righteousness,
not from any kitchen on earth, much less from hell. They therefore qui irae
suae stimulum zelum putant, they who imagine the flashes of natural choler are
flames of spiritual zeal, toto coelo errant, are as far from the mark as
heaven is distant from the earth. No natural or moral temper, much less any
unnatural and vicious distemper, can commend us or our best actions to God and
men as zeal does. The fire of zeal like the fire that consumed Solomon's
sacrifice, comes down from heaven; and true zealots are not those
Salamanders or Pyrausts that always live in the fire of hatred and contention;
but Seraphims, burning with the spiritual fire of divine love, who, as Saint
Bernard well notes, kept their rank and station in heaven, when the other
Angels of Lucifers band, that have their names from light, fell from theirs.
Lucifer cecidit, Seraphim stant, to teach us that zeal is a more excellent
grace than knowledge, even in Angels that excel in both. Howbeit though zeal
as far surpass knowledge as the sunne-beame does a glow-worme, yet zeal
must not be without knowledge. Wherefore God commands the Priest when he
Exodus 30.8.
lights the lamps to burn incense: though the fire be quick, and the
incense sweet, yet God accepts not of the burning it to him in the dark. The
Jews had a zeal, as the Romans 10.2.
Apostle acknowledges; and the Apostle himself before his conversion, yet
because it wanted knowledge, it did them and the Church of God great hurt. No
man can be ignorant of the direful effects of blind zeal: when an unskilful
Phaeton takes upon him to drive the chariot of the sun, he sets the whole
world in a combustion. What a mettled horse is without a bridle, or a
hot-spurred rider without an eye, or a ship in a high wind and swelling sail
without a rudder, that is zeal without knowledge; which is like the eye in the
rider to choose the way, or like the bridle in the hand to moderate the pace,
or like the rudder in the ship to steer safely the course thereof. Saint
Inser. 22. in Cant.
Bernard hits full on this point: Discretion without zeal is slow paced, and
zeal without discretion is heady; let therefore zeal spur on discretion,
and discretion reyne zeal; fervor discretionem erigat, and discretio fervorem
regat. Discretion must guide zeal, as it is guided by spiritual wisdom, not
worldly policy: and therefore

Thirdly, I add in the definition of zeal, that it quickens and enflameth
all our holy desires and affections according to the direction of spiritual
wisdom. For wisdom must prescribe zeal, when, and where, and how far, and in
what order to proceed in reforming all abuses in Church and State, and
performing all duties of religious piety, and eminent charity. What Isocrates
spoke sometime of valor or strength, is as true of zeal, viz. Isoc. ad Them.
(...), etc.
that zeal and resolution with wisdom does much good, but without, it does
much mischief to our selves and others; like grenades and other fireworks,
which if they be not well looked to, and ordered when they break, do more hurt
to them that cast them than to the enemy. Yet that we be not deceived in
mistaking worldly policy for wisdom, I add spiritual, to difference it from
carnal, moral, or civil wisdom; for they are too great coolers, they will
never let zeal exceed the middle temper of that Vibius.
Statesman in Tiberius Court, who was noted to be a wise and grave Counselor,
of a fair carriage, and untainted reputation; but he would Juven. sat. 4.
Ille igitur nunquam direxit brachia contra torrentem.
never strike a stroke against the stream, he would never own any man's
quarrel, he would be sure to save one. Such is the worldly wise man, he
will move no stone, though never so needful to be removed, if he apprehend
the least fear that any part of the wall will fall upon himself. The Cic. de
orat. l. 1. Tempus omne post consulatum objecimus iis fluctibus qui per nos a
communi peste depulsi in nosmetipsos redundarunt.
Roman Consul, and incomparable Orator shall be no president for him; who
employed all his force and strength to keep off those waves from the great
vessel of the State, which rebounded back again, and had near drowned the
cocke-boate of his private fortune. He will never engage himself so far in
any hot service, no not though Gods honor and the safety of the Church lie at
stake, but that he will be sure to come off without hazard of his life or
estate. He has his conscience in that awe that it shall not clamor against
him for not stickling in any business that may peradventure reflect upon his
state, honor, or security. In a word, peradventure he may be brought with
much ado to do something for God, but never to suffer any thing for him. This
lukewarm Laodicean disposition, the less offensive it is to men, the more
odious it is to God, who is a jealous God, and affects none but those that
are zealous for his glory; he loves none but those that will be content to
expose themselves to the hatred of all men for his names sake. He Jud. 5.23.
Curse ye Meros, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, because they came

accurseth all those in the name of Meros that refuse to come in their best

Laetus compend. hist. Romans
Anastasius the Emperor for his luke-warmnesse in the Catholic cause, and
endeavoring to reconcile the Arrians and Orthodoxe, or at least silence those
differences, was stricken to death with a hot thunderbolt. No Sacrifice is
acceptable to God that is not salted with the fire of zeal, which guided by
wisdom quickneth and enflameth all the inward desires as well as the outward
actions, that appertain to religion: for the chief seat of zeal is the
fountain of heat, and that is the heart; there it Psalm. 45.1.
bubbled in David, there it Luke 24.32. Did not our hearts burn when he
opened to us, etc.
burned in the disciples, it Psalm. 22.15. My heart is dried, etc.
consumed and dried up the very substance of the heart in Christ. If our zeal
burn not inwardly as well as outwardly, as well upwards toward God, as
downwards toward the world; if it inflame not our charity as well as incense
our piety; if the heat of it be cooled by age, or slacked by opposition, or
extinguished even by floods of bloody persecution, it is no true Vestall fire,
nor such as becomes Gods altar: for that might never, this did never go out;
sincerity it self is not so opposite to hypocrisy, as zeal. Sincerity
without zeal is a true, but a cold and faint-hearted, zeal is an eager,
fierce, hot, and courageous enemy of all hypocrites, whom she brandeth with an
eternal note of infamy. But because all fires are in a manner alike to the
eye, how should we know holy fire from profane, heavenly from earthly, that
is, zeal from enraged hypocrisy; pretending with Jehu, that he is zealous
for the Lord of hosts? I answer, as a precious Diamond is valued, by three
things: 1 Inward luster: 2 Number of caracts: 3 Solidity of substance.
and thereby is distinguished both from counterfeit gemmes, and those that are
of less value: so true zeal is distinguished from hypocritical by 1
Sincerity, 2 Integrity, 3 Constancy: all which notes are discernable in holy
Psalm. 119.2.
David's zeal.
1 Sincerity; I have loved thy testimonies with my heart, ver. 6.
yea my whole heart. 2 Integrity; I have had respect unto all thy
commandments: ver. 34.
all false ways I abhor. 3 Constancy; I have kept thy laws unto the end.
ver. 44.



When the face and hands and outward parts burn, as in a fever, the heart is
so cold that it quaketh and shivereth: so it is with the hypocrite, his tongue
always, and his hands too sometimes burn, Persius satyr.
-- Sed pone in pectore dextram
Nil calet. --
If you could put your hand into his bowels, you should find his heart like
Nabals, as cold as a stone. True zeal if it be transported, it is in private
devotion to God (si insanimus Deo insanimus) in outward carriage toward men it
proceeds resolutely indeed and undauntedly, but yet deliberately and
discreetly; it burns within most ardently, it scarce ever flameth or
sparkleth outwardly; like those bathes in the Pythecusian Islands, whereof
Balnea in Pythecusiis insulis fervent supra modum calore, and vi ignea, nec
tamen flammam emittunt. Vide Aristot. mirabilium auscult.
Aristotle writes, that they are hot above measure, and of a fiery nature, yet
send forth no flame.

Secondly, as insincerity discries the hypocrite, so also want of integrity.
Take the hypocrite that makes the fairest offer to zeal, though he
outstrippe some it may be in some works of piety, and duties of the first
Table, you shall take him tardy in most acts of charity, and duties of the
second Table. Peradventure he will slay smaller sins with the sword of the
Spirit, like the meanest of the Amalekites, but he will spare Agag and the
principal, his gainefull sins of simony, sacrilege, usury, and oppression;
he is never -- Totus teres atque rotundas. Go he as upright as he can you
shall perceive him to limpe and halt with God, or man, or both. If the point of
controversy in the Church no way touch his freehold, he takes it no more to
heart than Act. 18.17.
Gallio did the uproare about Saint Paul's preaching; then difference about
articles of faith, are but contentions about words, (...): but if it rub upon
his profit or credit with his own faction, then he never leaves crying out,
great is Act. 19.28.
Diana of the Ephesians. You may find an hypocrite zealous against Idolatry,
but you shall find him very moderate against sacrilege: if he have a months
mind to Rome he will stickle for the authority of the Church; but the
scripture is very cheap to him, he will deliver prayers by tale to God, the
blessed Virgin and Saints: but for Sermons, he holds it a kind of merit to
hear few of those of his own sect, and none of any other. On the contrary, if
he has been brought up at the feet of Cartwright or Brown, then he is all
for Scriptures, and nothing at all for the Church; all for preaching, and
nothing for prayer, unless it be an abortive issue of hi^ own brain, an
extemporary, indigested, incomposed, inconsequent ejaculation, in which he is
never out because he is never in. As for the premeditated, penned, advised, and
sanctified form of Service appointed by the Church, it is to him like the
white of an egg that has no taste in it. But the most certain and infallible
character of an hypocrite and his zeal, is the soon cooling and abating
thereof, and in the end evaporating into air; like a blazing star he glareth
for a time, but in a short space plays least in sight; like fireworks of
danke powder, he never leaves shooting off on these and the like watch-towers
whilst his matter lasts, but when that is spent goes out in a fume or
stench. True beauty bears off all weathers, but paint is washed off with a
shower, or discovered by the fire. Saint Basil's emblem was columna ignea, a
fiery pillar; fiery, there is his zeal; a pillar, there is his constancy. I
doubt whether nature can present such a stone as the name Asbestus in the
original signifies, that is, a stone of fire that nothing can extinguish: but
I am sure grace can, and that is this jewel of zeal I have been so long in
describing; for it burns always in the heart and can never be quenched. I
would be loath to be thought to go about to quench the smoking flax, or
discourage any man in whom there is a spark of this fire covered with ashes;
yet I should deceive them, or suffer them to be misled with an ignis fatuus,
if I should not tell them that if this their zeal like a lamp or candle arise
not up in the socket, and make the greatest blaze at the last, it is no true
zeal. Not. hist. l. 37. c. 10. Chrysolampis pallidi coloris est interdiu,
nocte ignei. l. 2. c. 103. Fons solis circa meridiem maxim frigidus est, ad
noctis medium fervore infestatur.
Pliny writes that the Chrysolamp is of a pale color in the day, but of a
fiery in the night: and in like manner he reports of the fountain of the
sun, springing in the country of the Troglodites, that at midday it is
extreme cold, but extreme hot at midnight; and Solinus the like of a Well by
Debris. I wish I did not see in these fountains, or the color of the
Chrysolampis, the picture of our nations zeal. In the dark of ignorance, or
midnight of Popery was not our zeal for Gods truth exceeding hot and fiery?
but now in the sunshine of the Gospel is it not of a cool temper, like
fons solis, the fountain of the sun, and of a pale color like the Chrysolamp
in the day? Solin. c. 32. Apud Debrim oppidum Garamantum fons est qui die
friget, nocte fervet, friget calore, calet frigore.
There was a time when like the Galatians the people of this City and Kingdom
would have plucked out their very eyes for the Ministers of the Gospel, and
have chosen rather to have lost the lights of their body than of their soul:
but now many care not how little they see us upon these or the like
watch-towers. May not God complain of our zeal as he did of the
righteousness of Ephraim, that it is like the Hos. 6.4.
morning dew, when the sun grows hot not a drop to be seen on the
grass? It was the reproach of our neighbor nation, Primus impetus plus quam
virorum, secundus minor quam foeminarum.
That in their first assault they were more than men, in the second less than
women. I pray God we justify them not in our fight against sin and Satan, and
conflicts with temptation, in which we are not so valiant at the first as we
are cowardly at the last. May we not daily observe many, who at their first
entry into the ministry are so zealous, so frequent, so diligent in their
preaching, that a man durst engage himself deeply for them, that they would
prove true Vide vit. Juell praefix. oper.
Juels, dye standing in the Pulpet: and yet shortly after, great preferments
coming upon them, they verify that Proverb, leves curae loquuntur, ingentes
stupent? Have we not Guardians of our Churches, that in their first year
present more abuses than a zealous Nehemiah can reform in seven; yet
afterward when they are made of the Cabin-Councell, and become leaders in our
Vestries, and have learned that Demosthenes received a greater reward for
silence than Aeschines for speaking, they erect a Court of Faculties in their
own breast, and dispense with themselves for perjury: videntes vident and non
discernunt, and audientes audiunt and non intelligunt; in seeing they see
scores, nay hundreds receiving the Communion standing, or sitting at their best
ease: they see, especially in the suburbs, not only on other holy days, but
also on the Lord's Day, Alehouses and Tavernes full, and Churches empty: in the
City seeing they see but will not discern many a reverend Paul, and hopeful
Timothy forsaken of the better part of their auditory, who run a gadding
after some new schismatic Lecturer, whose name is up; who resembles our
late and new found Wels, that work wonders for a Summer, and multitudes of
people flock to them, but afterward all their virtue is gone? As in seeing
they see these things and discern them not, so in hearing they hear and
understand not: they hear old heresy new varnished, refined popery, yea
sometimes direct and gross, and yet they either do not, or will not
understand it: they hear Popish Priests and Jesuits at their next door
mumbling Masses, and yet understand it not: they hear in the Pulpet our
reverend Prelates, most worthy double honor, our zealous Nehemiahs, our
Christian Courts, our sacred Canons, our decent Ceremonies jeared at or sighed
against in a pang of Amsterdamian zeal, and yet they understand it not. What
should I speak of the people in general, who when a Chrysostom first opens
his golden mouth amongst them, throng and crowd at the Church doors, and not
only fill all the seats, but climb into the windows, and hang upon iron
bars, and contribute so freely to his maintenance, that they need to be
restrained by law, as the Israelites were in Moses time; but after a year or
two they follow Eras. adag.
Mandrabulus his steps, who finding great treasure, as he conceived, by
direction of Juno of Samos, offered to her the first year a Statue of gold,
the next year of silver, the third year of brass? So at the first they offer
gold in abundance, afterward they turn their gold into silver, and then their
silver into brass tokens, and last of all these into air. As a temporary
faith justifies us not before God, so neither temporary charity before men;
true zeal is not a flash, or a blaze, but a lasting fire that burns always:
it is good, says Saint Gal. 4.18.
Paul, to be zealous in a good matter always.

By the marks I have now set upon the hypocrite, you may descry him, and sever
him from a zealous Christian: and by those which follow in the definition of
zeal, Enflaming all the desires and affections in the true worship of the true
God, the holy fire of the sanctuary is distinguished from all such strange fire
as our Nadabs and Abihu's, superstitious, idolatrous, seditious, or
presumptuous zealots offer.

1 The lay Papist is a kind of zealot; for his zeal eats up his time and his
estate too: yet he is not zealous, because his zeal is not employed and
exercised in the true worship of God, according to his word, but according to
man's will and invention; viz. in praying to Saints, in worshipping images, in
suffrages for the dead, in seeing Masses, and adoring the host, and telling
out a fet number of Pater-nosters, and Ave-Maries upon hallowed beads, in
making superstitious vows, and going in pilgrimage, and abstaining from
certain meats, and wearing haire-cloth, and whipping themselves, and creeping
on all four to a crucifix, and the like: of all which we demand as God does
of the Jews by the Prophet Esaias, Isa. 1.12. Who has required these things at
your hands?
Who required these things?

2 The idolatrous heathen is a kind of zealot: for he is not content to offer
beasts only to God, with the Jew, but men also to their gods. For in some
places they sacrifice their children, as among the Moabites: in others their
fathers, as among the Triballi: elsewhere their princes or priests, as among
the Indians: and in some countries themselves, as among the Americans: yet for
all this their throwing themselves into, or causing others to pass through the
fire to their Moloch, or Saturn, or Abaddon, they are not to be accounted
zealously affected in religion, because what they do in this kind, is not
done by Gods commandment, nor intended to his honor; but in obedience, and to
the honor of an Idol, or Devil, whom they worship in stead of the true God.

3 The Jesuit, or Jesuited Romanist is a kind of zealot: for he will
compass sea and land to make a proselyte, he will stick at nothing for the
advantage of the catholic cause, no not the sticking or stabbing of Kings and
Princes: his zeal is so hot, that it will kindle a fire to blow up whole
Parliaments for an Holocaust to the Roman Moloch; yet is he not zealous,
because he is hot and fervent, not for Christ, but for Antichrist; and he
uses not sanctified, but execrable and damnable means to promote the
catholic cause (as he terms it) and enlarge the territories of the Man of
sin.

The last condition of true zeal is, that it keep within the walk of men's
special calling, which they who confound, for the most part bring confusion
upon themselves, as did King Uzziah, who would be thought out of zeal to
burn incense unto the Lord; but because he took upon him to do that which 2 Chronicles. 26.18.
appertained not to him, but to the Priests of the Lord the sons of Aaron,
that were consecrated thereunto, his incense stanke in the nostrils of God,
ver. 19.
and himself also: for a leprosy rose up in his forehead before the Priests
in the house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar; and Azariah the chief
Priest thrust him out of the Temple, ver. 20.
yea himself hasted also to go out, because the Lord had smitten him. Nothing
is more necessary or useful than fire, if it be kept within the furnace,
oven, or tunnell of the chimney, yea or within the barrel of the piece, and
from thence orderly issue out; but nothing so dangerous if it be not contained
within the hearth, or break out of it self, and fly abroad: so nothing is
more commendable or profitable than well guided, nothing more incommodious and
perilous than exorbitant zeal; when the Prince medleth with the censer, or
the Priest with the scepter: when private men take the sword out of the
Magistrates hand, or the Magistrate mis-applyeth the public sword of justice
to revenge his private wrongs.

Thus have I at length defined zeal, and confined it within the limits of
every man's lawful and special calling. Which limits shall be the bounds of my
speech and your attention at this present. The best Plin. not hist. l. 12. c.
ult. Optimum quod est odoratissimum e semine, ac maximum and ponderosissimum,

balsamum and most sovereign, is that which is biting in the taste, and
burning in the mouth: such have been the observations upon this text, biting
in the taste, and hot in the mouth. God grant that like true balsamum they may
prove a savor of life unto life to all that have heard me this day. I am come
with our Saviors Commission, to put fire among you; and what is my desire, but
that forthwith it be kindled, to purge out all your dross, to purify the sons
of Levi like Mal. 3.2.
silver, to burn up all hay and stubble built upon the foundation of our most
holy faith, and lastly, to consume all our spiritual sacrifices? But non opis
est nostrae, non opus est nostrum; alas it is not my breath will do it, it
must be the blast of Gods holy Spirit, that can first kindle, and after keep
this sacred fire in the hearth of our hearts. To him therefore who descended in
the Act. 2.3.
similitude of fiery cloven tongues, let us lift up our hearts, hands, and
voices, beseeching him to tind and preserve this spiritual fire in our 1
Hearts, 2 Ears, 3 Tongues, 4 Hands; that we may be zealously affected to
Godward, in meditating on him, in hearing from him, in praying to him, in doing
and suffering for him. To knit up all in a word, His grace make us sincerely,
entirely, discreetly, and constantly zealous, 1 Of his gifts, 2 In his service,
3 For his honor: to whom be ascribed all honor, glory, etc.



THE SEASONING OF ALL SPIRITUAL SACRIFICES: OR The Salters Text. A Sermon
preached before the Company of the Salters at S. Mary's Church in Bread-street.
THE FIFTEENTH SERMON.
MARK 9.49. For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
shall be salted with salt.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
THat I may not entertain your religious attention with a cold or unseasonable
discourse, I have made choice of a text, wherein I find both fire and salt;
fire to heat it, and salt to season it. And if any parcel of Scripture may be
appropriated to any of the Worshipful Societies or Companies of this
Honorable City, certainly you may challenge a peculiar interest in this. For
here is both salt and salting (from whence you take your name) both of men and
sacrifices. The best of all creatures on earth are men, and the best of all
gifts of men are sacrifices, and both are made savory and acceptable to God by
seasoning; they with fire, these with salt. In relation to the former, me
thinks as Christ said to Andrew and Peter, Matthew. 4.19.
Follow me and I will make you fishers of men; so I hear the holy spirit say
to me, Observe this text well and apply it, and I will make thee a salter of
men; for every man must be salted with fire, and, as it follows, Every
sacrifice must be salted with salt. Lev. 2.13. Every obla^ion of the meat
offering shall thou season with salt, neither shall thou suffer the covenant of
thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering.
With all thine offerings thou shall offer salt, says Moses from God: Every
sacrifice shall be salted with salt, says Christ from Moses; whose drift in
this place is somewhat obscure, because the sense is covered under the veil of
an Allegory, which we cannot draw without looking up higher into the chapter,
and touching upon the precedent verses. Wherein our Lord threatens
unquenchable fire, and an immortal worm to all that for want of the fire of
zeal grow cold in religion; and for lack of the salt of grace putrefie in
their sins. If, says he, that person or thing that causes thee to offend,
either in want of courage for God, or of zeal and Christian resolution against
thy bosom sins and natural corruptions, be as dear to thee as thine eye,
or as necessary as thy right hand, part with them thou must; if it be an eye,
pluck it out; if an hand, cut it off, and cast it away from thee; better see
thy self in heaven with one eye, than to see thy self in hell with both;
better hoppe into life with one leg, than run to eternal death with both;
better without a right hand to be set with the sheep at Gods right hand, than
having a right hand to be set at Gods left hand, and afterward with both
thine hands be bound to be cast into hell fire, ver. 44.46.48.
where the worm never dies, and the fire is not quenched, and again, and a
third time, where the worm never dies, and the fire is not quenched. At the
mention whereof, it being the burden of his doleful Sonnet, our Savior
perceiving the ears of his auditors to tingle, in the words of my text he
yields a reason of that his so smart and biting admonition, saying, For every
one shall be salted, etc. and withal he shows them a means to escape that
unquenchable fire which they so much dreaded, and to kill the immortal worm
which even now began to bite them. The means to escape the one, is to be
salted here with fire; and the means to kill the other, is to be salted here
with salt; for salt preserves from that putrefaction which breeds that
worm. He who now is salted with the fire of zeal, or heart-burning sorrow for
his sins, shall never hereafter be salted with the fire of hell: this fire
will keep out that, as Ovid. Met. l. 2. Saevis compescuit ignibus ignes.
Jupiters fire drove out Phaetons: and he who macerateth here his fleshly
members with the salt of Gods incorrupt word, and the cleansing grace of his
spirit, shall never putrefie in his sins, nor feel the torment of the never
dying worm.

The Philosophers make three partitions, as it were, in the soul of man: the
first they call the reasonable, or seat of judgment; the second, the
irascible, or seat of affections; the third, the concupiscible, or the seat of
desires and lusts. In the reasonable part they who knew nothing of the fall of
man, and original corruption, find little amiss; but in the concupiscible
they note (...), something like superfluous moisture inclining to luxury; in
the irascible, (...), or (...), something like cold or rawnesse enclining to
fear: behold in my text a remedy for both; fire for the one, and salt for the
other. And that we may not lose a spark of this holy fire, or a grain of
this salt so sovereign, let us in a more exact division observe, 1 Two kinds
of seasoning: 1 With fire: 2 With salt.
2 Two sorts of things to be seasoned: 1 Men without limitation, Every: 2
Sacrifices without exception, All.



God Genesis 4.4.
had respect unto Abel and his sacrifice; first to Abel, and then to his
offering: he accepts not the man for his sacrifice, but the sacrifice for
the man's sake. First therefore of men and their salting with fire; and after of
sacrifices and their salting with salt.

Every one shall be salted with fire. Saint Hieron. in hunc locum. Mire dictum
est, etc. ille vere victima domini est, qui corpus and animam a vitus
emundando, Deo per amorem consecratur, nec sale aspergitur, sed igne
consumitur, quando non peccati tantum contagio pellitur, sed and praesentis
vitae delectatio tollitur, and futurae conversationi tota^ mente suspiratur.
Jerome was much taken with this speech of our Savior: it is, says he, an
admirable saying; That which is seasoned with salt is preserved from corruption
of vermin; that which is salted with fire loses some of the substance; with
both the sacrifices of the old Law were seasoned: such a sacrifice in the
Gospel is he, who cleansing his body and soul from vice, by love
consecrateth himself to God; who then it not only sprinkled with salt, but
also consumed with fire, when not only the contagion of sin is driven away,
but also all delight of this present life is taken away; and we sigh with our
whole soul after our future conversation, which shall be with God and his
Angels in heaven. It is news to hear of salting of men, especially with fire:
an uncouth expression, yet used by our Savior to strike a deeper impression
into the minds of his hearers: and verily the Metaphor is not so hard and
strained, as the duty required is harsh and difficult to our nature. It went
much against flesh and blood to hear of plucking out an eye, or cutting off an
hand or foot, yet that is nothing in comparison to salting with fire: salt
draws out the corrupt blood, and superfluous moisture out of flesh, but fire
takes away much of the substance thereof, if not all. For the fattest and best
parts of all sacrifices were devoured by the flame, of such things as were
offered to God by fire. If such a salting be requisite, we must then not
only part with an eye, or a hand, or a foot, but even with heart, and head,
and whole body to be burned for the testimony of the Gospel; if so the case
stand that either we must leave our body behind us, or we leave Christ. Such a
salting is here prescribed by our high Priest, as draws out not only corrupt
moisture, but consumes much of the flesh also, yea sometimes all; (that is)
not only bereaveth us of superfluous vanities, and sinful pleasures, but even
of our chief comforts of life it self, our friends, our estates, our honors,
yea sometimes our very bodies. So hot is this fire, so quick is this salt.
Those that are redeemed by Christ's blood, must think nothing too dear for him
who paid so dear for them: rather than forfeit their faith, and renounce the
truth, they must willingly lay all at stake for his sake, who pawned not only
his humane body and soul, but after a sort his divine person also, to satisfy
the justice of God for us.

Every one. How far this Every one extends, and what this salting with fire
signifies, the best Interpreters, ancient and latter, are not fully agreed.
Some restrain every one to the reprobate only, and by fire understand
hellfire: others to the elect only, and by fire understand the fire of Gods
spirit, or grace, burning out, as it were, and consuming our natural
corruptions. They who stand for the former interpretation, conceive that Christ
in these words yields a reason why he said that hellfire shall never be
quenched; Ver. 48.
for every one (that is say they) of the damned in hell shall be salted with
that fire; the fire shall be to their bodies as salt is to flesh, which keeps
it from putrefying. O cruel mercy of hellish flames: O saving destruction: O
preservation worse than perdition: O fire eternally devouring, and yet
preserving its own fuel: O punishment bringing continual torments to the
damned, and continuing their bodies and souls in it! It is worse than death to
be kept alive to eternal pains: it is worse than perdition to be saved for
ever in these flames, to be ever scorched and never consumed, that is, to be
ever dying and never dye. Here, as Saint Aug. de civit. Dei, l 13. c. 11. Ibi
non erunt homines ante mortem, neque post mortem, sed semper in morte, atque
per hoc nunquam viventes, nunquam mortui, sed sine fine morientes.
Austine acutely observes, we can never be said properly dying, but either
alive or dead; for to the moment of giving up the ghost, we are alive, and
after that dead; whereas on the contrary, the damned in hell can never be said
to be alive or dead, but continually dying: not dead, because they have most
quick sense of pain; not alive, because they are in the pangs of the second
death. O miserable life where life is continually dying; O more miserable death
where death is eternally living! Yea, but shall all be salted with this fire,
the fire of hell? God forbid. Does Christ say of this salt, not of the earth
but of hell, that it is good? (ver. 50.) is this the meaning of his
exhortation, have salt in you; that is, procure the salt of hell fire to keep
you alive in the torments of eternal death, to preserve you to everlasting
perdition? By no means. In hunc locum.
Maldonat therefore and Barradius, and all that are for this first
interpretation are justly to be blamed, because they had an eye to the
antecedents, but not to the consequents of my text. On the other side, those
who adhere to the second interpretation are not free from just exception,
because they had an eye to the consequents, and not to the antecedents. For we
ought to give such an interpretation of these words as may hold good
correspondence both with the antecedents and consequents, and either give light
to both, or receive it from them. The elect, to whom these latter restrain the
word All, have nothing to do with the unquenchable fire of hell, mentioned
ver. 48. neither have the reprobate, to whom the former interpreters
appropriate these words, any thing to do with the good salt, ver. 50. yet both
have to do with some kind of salting, and with some kind of fire. For every
one shall be salted one way or other, either here with the fire of the spirit
seasoning our nature and preserving it from corruption; or hereafter with the
fire of hell. There is no means to escape the never dying worm of an evil
conscience, but by having salt in us, nor to prevent the unquenchable fire of
hell, but by fire from heaven, I mean, heart-burning sorrow for our sins:
Dolor est medicina doloris.

That we may not be hereafter salted with the fire of hell, we must be here
salted with a threefold fire: of 1 The word: 2 The spirit: 3 Affliction, or
persecution.


First, with the fire of the word: the word is a fire; Jer. 23.29.
Is not my word like a fire, says the Lord? It has the three properties of
fire: 1 To give light: 2 To burn: 3 To search.


First, it gives light; therefore Psalm. 119. it is called a lanthorn to our
steps, and a light to our paths. Secondly, it burns, 1 In the ear: 2 In the
mouth: 3 In the heart.


First, in the ear: 1 Samuel 3.11.
Whosoever hears my words, says God, his ears shall tingle. Secondly it
burns in the mouth, Jerem. 5.14.
I will make my words fire in the mouth. Thirdly, it burns in the heart, Luke
24.32.
Did not our heart burn within us when he opened to us the scriptures?

Lastly, it searches, pierces, and tries like fire, The Heb. 4.12.
word of God is mighty in operation, and sharper than a two-edged sword, etc.

Secondly, with the fire of the spirit; the spirit is a fire, Act. 1.5.
You shall be baptized with the holy Ghost and with fire. Water will wash out
filthy spots and blots on the skin only; but fire is more powerful, it will
burn out rotten flesh and corrupt matter under the skin. This fire of the
holy Ghost enlightneth the understanding with knowledge, enflameth the will and
affections with the love of God, and zeal for his glory, and purges out all
our drossie corruptions.

Thirdly, with the fire of persecution and affliction. Persecution is called a
1 Pet. 4.12.
fiery trial; and all kind of afflictions and temptations, wherewith Gods
Saints are tried, in Saint Austines judgment, are the fire whereof Saint Paul
speaks; 1 Cor. 3.15.
He shall be saved, as it were through fire. And of a truth, whatsoever the
meaning of that text be, certain it is that the purest vessels of Gods
sanctuary, first in the Heathen, next in the Arrian, and last of all in the
Antichristian persecution, have been purified and made glorious like gold
tried in the fire. There is no torment can be devised by man or devil whereof
experiments have not been made on the bodies of Christ's martyrs: yet the
greater part of them, especially in these later times, have been offered to
God by fire, as the Holocausts under the law. Bloody persecutors of Gods
Saints, set on fire with hell, of all torments most employed the fiery, because
they are most dreadful to the eye of the beholders, most painful to the body
of the sufferers, and they leave nothing of the burned martyr, save ashes,
which sometimes the adversaries ma^ice outlasting the flames of fire, cast into
the river. And many of Gods servants in this land, as well as in other parts,
in the memory of our fathers have been salted with this fire; call you it
whether you please, either the fire of martyrdom, or martyrdom of fire. And
howsoever this fire in the days of Queen Mary was quenched especially by the
blood of the slain for the testimony of Jesus Christ, as the fire in the city
of the Live. decad 3. l. 8 Bruson. facet. and exempl. l. 1.
Astapani (as Livie observes) when no water could lave it our, was
extinguished with the blood of the citizens: yet we know not but that it may
be kindled again, unless we blow out the coals of wrath against us with
the breath of our prayers, or dead them with our tears. Admit that that fire
should never be kindled again, yet God has many other fires to salt us
withal, burning fevers, fiery serpents, thunder and lightning, heart-burning
griefs and sorrows, loss of dearest friends, wrack of our estates, infamy,
disgrace, vexations, oppressions, indignation at the prosperity of the wicked,
terrors of conscience, and spiritual derelictions. And God grant that either
by the fire of the Word, or of the Spirit, or seasonable afflictions, our
fleshly corruptions may be so burned out in this life, that we be not salted
hereafter with the fire of hell; which burns, but lights not; scorcheth,
but yet consumes not; works without end both upon soul and body, yet makes
an end of neither. O that they who are frozen in their sins were sometimes
singed and thawed with the consideration of this infernal and eternal fire!
If they did but mind it, they could not but fear it; and if they feared it,
they would in time seek means to escape it; and if they sought them in time,
they might find them in my text. And so I pass from the salting of men with
fire, to the seasoning of sacrifices with salt.

Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. There was nothing but 2 King. 2.14.
death and barrenness in the waters of Jericho till Elisha cast salt in the
springs. In these waters Saint Isidor. Pelus. ep. 16. (...).
Isidore descryeth a type of our natural estate, wherein we were dead in
sins, and barren of good works, till the true Elisha, Christ Jesus, cast
salt in the springs, I mean, our hearts, whence are the issues of life. Salt
has three most known properties; 1 To powder: 2 To season: 3 To cleanse.


It powdereth flesh, and keeps it from putrefaction: it seasoneth meats and
drinks: and it cleanses wounds, fretting and eating out the corrupt matter in
them. And answerable hereunto there are three effects of the word mixed with
faith; 1 It powdereth the heart: 2 It seasoneth the speech: 3 It cleanses the
sores of wounded consciences.


Material salt is not more necessary in our houses, than this spiritual salt
in the house of God; for without it no taste of goodness, no relish of
holiness, no sapour pleasing to God. In some sacrifices of the old law, flesh,
in some wine, in some oil, in some meal; but in all and with all salt was
offered. These sacrifices were not only shadows of the body, which was
Christ's sacrifice on the cross; but also types of our spiritual sacrifices:
the meat offerings of our alms deeds, whereby we feed the hungry; the drink
offerings of our penitent tears; the peace offerings of our praise and
thanksgiving; the heave offerings of our elevated desires and affections; the
whole burnt offering or holocaust of martyrdom for the testimony of the
Gospel. And as the legal sacrifices were seasoned with salt, and consumed with
fire; so all our spiritual sacrifices must be seasoned with the salt of
discretion, and consumed with the fire of zeal. And because the zeal is in
the man, and the discretion is seen in his offering, it is said, Every man
shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. To
begin with the holocaust, or whole burnt-offering. When a servant of Christ
overcommeth the violence of fire by his faith, and remains as unmoved in the
torment thereof, as the Godwin in Archiep Cant. Cranmerus flamma saeviente,
erectis in coelum oculis, Domine suscipe spiritum meum exclamavit, and corpore
tam immotus perstitit quam palus cui alligatus est.
stake at which he is burnt: in this sacrifice salt is most necessary, I
mean, the salt of spiritual wisdom and religious discretion. For a man must
not offer himself to the merciless flames; but being adjudged to them, and by
the secular arm brought to them, patiently and cheerfully suffer them, rather
than deny the Lord that bought him. No man must seal the truth of the Gospel
with his blood, unless he be called in as a witness, and required to
depose: and then he must not only depose in a free profession of his faith,
but also deposite his life for the further confirmation of his Christian
profession. He that is called to suffer, must in the first place consider for
what he suffers; for all are not blessed that suffer, but those that Mat.
5.10.
suffer for righteousness. Blessed, indeed most blessed are they that are
persecuted for righteousness sake; not those who are executed as malefactors,
for murder, felony, blasphemy, schism, obstinacy or fancy. None dies a Martyr
but he who dies for the faith by which the just lives. If a Jew be scourged
to death for the abrogated rites of the ceremonial law: or a Jesuited Papist
hanged, drawn, and quartered, according to the penal statutes of this
kingdom, for treason against the Prince, in the Popes quarrel: or if an
Anabaptist be burned to ashes for his fanaticall and fantastical revelations;
he dies the Popes, or his own Martyr, not Christ's. His suffering, as Ep. 1.
Si occisi extra ecclesiam fuerint, corona fidei non est, sed potius poena
perfidiae.
Cyprian the blessed Martyr determines the point against all heretics, is,
Poena perfidiae, non corona fidei, a punishment for his heresy or
perfidiousnesse, not a crown of faith or a wreath of glory.

Another sacrifice of the whole man, is when a devout Christian gives up his
members as servants unto righteousness, and his whole body as a living Romans
12.1.
sacrifice unto God: in this likewise the salt of spiritual wisdom and
discretion is most requisite. For we must so devote our selves to the service
of God, that we altogether forget not our duty to man: we must so follow the
things that are above, that we neglect not our affairs below, quit not our
calling on earth, much less in aspiring to angelical perfection, cast our
selves down beneath Heathens and Infidels, by casting away all care of
provision for our 1 Timothy 5.8. If any provide not for his own, and especially
those of his house, or kindred, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an
Infidel.
family. There was never any sect had a more plausible pretext for their
heresy than the Euchites, who nothing but prayed continually: yet because they
distinguished not between time and season, misunderstanding the precept of the
Apostle, 1 These. 5.17.
pray continually; which requires that we pray upon every occasion, and at all
seasons, that is, fit hours for prayer, not simply, at all times which are
allotted us by God for Eccl. 3.1.
every purpose under heaven; but especially because they jusled out all other
duties of piety and Christian charity for it, they were themselves by the
ancient Fathers driven out of the Church, and deservedly excommunicated, who
Epiph haeres. Massal and Euchi^. and Aug. de haeres. ad quod vult Deum.
communicated nothing to the public, but were all for their private devotion.

Undoubtedly, as when the fattest and best of the sacrifice was consumed, the
Priests might take the rest for their use; so after we have given God the
flower and best of our time, the rest we may, nay we must employ in the
works of our special calling for our own and others behoof.

Next to the sacrifice of the whole man is the sacrifice of the hidden man, of
the heart, I mean, Psalm. 51.17.
a broken spirit, and contrite heart. In this sacrifice the salt of discretion
is as necessary as in the former. For even godly sorrow must not exceed, the
rivers of Paradise must be kept within their banks. A man may prick his
heart for his sin, nay wound it, but he must not kill it. He may dive deep
into the waters of Mara, but not stay so long under the water till he be
drowned. He that has grievously wronged Gods justice by presumption, let him
take heed that he do not more wrong his mercy by desperation: his sins can
be but finite, but Gods mercy, and Christ's merits are infinite.

There remains yet two other sacrifices, the sacrifice of the tongue, and the
sacrifice of the hand, Prayer, and Almsdeeds: Prayers are termed Hos. 14.2.
Render the calves of your lips.
Vituli labiorum, the Calves of the lips; and Almsdeeds are graced with the
title of Heb. 13.16. To do good and communicate forget not, for with such
scarifices God is well pleased.
sacrifices by the Apostle; and Saint Austine yields a good reason for it;
because God accepts these pro sacrificiis, or prae sacrificiis, for, or
before all sacrifices. With both these salt must be offered, the salt of
discretion with the one, and of admonition with the other: spiritual wisdom
must guide both the lifting up of our hands to God, and the stretching them out
to our brethren.

First for prayer. No unsavory prayers proceeding from a corrupt heart are
pleasing to God; no words sound well in his ears but such as are consonant to
his word, and minister grace to the hearers. Let my Psalm. 141.2.
prayer, says the Psalmist, be directed to thee as incense; prayer must be
directed, not suddenly thrown up, as it were at all adventures. Wisdom and
intention must direct it, not to Saints and Angels, but to God. As it must be
directed, and that to God; so in the third place it must be directed as incense
from a burning censer, that is, a zealous heart; or, to use the phrase of my
text, it must be seasoned with salt, the salt of discretion, and salted with
fire, the fire of zeal. Is this to pray and praise God, to draw near to him
with our lips, when our hearts are far from him? to lift up our eyes and
hands to heaven when our minds are on earthly things? is this to pray unto, or
praise God, to vent out our unhallowed desires and indigested thoughts in
broken words, without any premeditation, order, or connection? No surely, this
is not to offer to God Vitulos labiorum, the calves of our lips, but labia
vitulorum, the lips of calves.

You hear how needful salt is in the sacrifice of the tongue: as necessary it
is in the sacrifice of the hands. Psalm. 41.1.
Blessed is he, says the Kingly Prophet, qui intelligit super egenum, who
considers the poor and needy; that is, first takes notice of their
condition and quality, and accordingly relieveth them, lest otherwise he
contribute to idleness, and not to necessity. Some want work to their will,
others will to work: some are impotent indeed, others are counterfeit: to the
one a gift is an almes-deed, to the other the best alms is to give them a
sharp admonition, or send them with their errand to the House of correction.
The Philosopher might say when he bestowed an alms upon a lewd rogue,
Plutarch. apoph.
Non homini dedised humanitati, Not to the man but to manhood; not to his
person, but to his nature; not to his ill conditions, but to his miserable
condition: but he that fears God must take heed that he cast not seed upon
accursed earth, lest it bring forth the fruits of Gomorrha; or it prove like
the seed sown by Ovid. Met l. 3. Vipereos dentes populi incrementa futuri,
etc. Crescitque seges clypeata virorum.
Cadmus, whence grew up on the sudden armed men, I mean an army of sturdy
beggars, armed against us in the highways. He must make a conscience both
what he gives, and out of what, and in what manner, and to what end. First,
what; he must not give the childrens bread to dogs: secondly, out of what;
he must not give to God of that which he has stolen from man, or got by any
indirect courses, for this were to make God accessory to his stolen goods:
thirdly, in what manner; manu serendum, non corbe, he must cast seed out
thriftily by the hand, not carelessly throw it out of the basket; he must so
draw out that the spring of bounty be not exhausted: fourthly, to what end; to
glorify God, not to receive praise from men; to relieve want, not to maintain
vice. Though his left hand must not know what his right hand does, yet his
right eye must know and direct his right hand to pour the oil into the wounds
of the Samaritane, and not to spill it upon the sound flesh. As eye salve laid
to the foot profits not at all; and a plaster or poultess made for the
feet, if it be applied to the eye endangereth the sight: so bounty misplaced
does more hurt than good, benefacta male locata, malefacta arbitror.

The application.
I wish it were so in the ministering physic for the soul, as it is in the
physic for the body, where the Physician prescribes, and the Apothecary
ministers: the Physician makes, or appoints the making of the salve, and
leaves it to the Apothecary to apply it. For of all texts this needs most
warily to be applied, because there is in it both fire and salt; and fire if
it be laid close will scorch, and salt if it be rubbed into a wound will make
it smart. Howbeit the best is, that rule in corporal physic holds also in
this; Nulla medicamenta tam faciunt dolorem quam quae sunt salutaria, The more
bitter the potion for the most part the more effectual; and the more smarting
the plaster the more wholesome. To apply therefore in a word. In the setting
forth of any banquet or service, fire and salt must be at hand; fire to dress
the meat, and salt to season it. Likewise in the sacrifices of the old law
neither fire nor salt could be wanting; salt to prepare the sacrifices for the
altar, and fire to consume them upon it. Neither can there be any spiritual
sacrifice, or evangelicall service acceptable unto God, without the fire of
zeal, and salt of discretion. Zealous discretion, and discreet zeal is a rare
composition, not of art but of grace, which makes both our persons and our
offering agreeable unto God. No cold service, nor unsavory dish is for his
taste: without heat of zeal the sacrifice we offer is the sacrifice of dead
men; and without salt of discretion the sacrifice we offer is a sacrifice of
fools. Profaneness and worldliness cold in the true worship of God,
offers a dead sacrifice; and idolatry and superstition hot in the false
worship, offers a foolish sacrifice; religion in the middle, being zealous in
the true service of a God, offers a holy, living, and reasonable sacrifice
unto him; by zealous discretion pleasing God; and by discreet zeal men. Some
offer unto God fire, but want salt, they are zealous without discretion: some
have salt, but want fire, they are discreet but without zeal. The Papists have
fire, fervent zeal, but they want salt, direction from Gods word, and
judgment to discern between reasonable service and will worship; and for
want of this salt their devotions are tainted with much superstition. The
conformable Protestant has store of salt, wholesome directions from Gods word
to season his spiritual sacrifices, but does he not want fire? is he as
zealous for Christ as the other is for Antichrist? does he contribute as
freely to the pure worship of God, as the other does to the garish service of
the Mass? are his eyes as often fixed on Christ in heaven, as the others are
on his crucifixe? does he keep the Lords day as strictly as the other does
our Ladies, and other Saints? Although the Papist has no command for hallowing
any day to Saints, especially such as we find in the Roman Calendar: we
have both the command of God, and the injunctions of the Church to devote this
day Homily of the time and place of prayer.
wholly to the service of God; yet how many Clients on this day besiege your
doors, when you and we all should be Clients only unto God? Should God
deal so with us in our portion of time on the weeke-dayes, as we deal with
him in his; should he restrain the light of the sun, and take away so many
hours from every day in the week, as we defaulk from his service on this
day, what darkness, what outcries, what horror, what confusion would be in
all the world? When Xen Cyr. paed. l. 2.
Cyrus was young, Sacas was appointed by his Grandfather to be his moderatour,
both in his diet, recreations, and all expense of time; but when he grew riper
in years he became a Sacas to himself, and took not so much liberty as
Sacas would have given him. Where the law seems too laxe, there every man
ought to be a Sacas to himself, and for the health of his soul forbear
something that is permitted to the recreation of his body. Again, those who
are of the stricter and preciser sort have fire in their invectives against
Popery, in their reproof of sin, and their voluntary and extemporary
devotions; but they want many a grain of salt, and therefore offer often
times, with Nadab and Abihu, strange fire upon Gods altar: they distinguish not
between Episcopal Hierarchy and Papal tyranny; superstitious rites and
comely ceremonies; decent ornaments and meretricious painting of Christ's
spouse. They are always Boanerges, and seldom or never Barnabasses; always
Sons of thunder, and seldom or never Sons of consolation. And when they are
Sons of thunder, and cast forth their lightning, it is not like the lightning
whereof Plin. not. hist. c. 51. l. 2. Martia gravida icta partu exanimato vixit.
Pliny writes, which killed Martia's child in her womb, but hurt not her at
all; that is, destroy sin in the conscience, but no way hurt the person in
his reputation: but contrariwise, they blast the person, but kill not the sin.
Their prayers are all fiery indeed, burning with zeal, and therein
commendable; but for want of salt of discretion they make all things fuel for
this sacred fire; like fire their devotion keeps within no bounds. As the
ringing, so the praying now adays in request is all upon the changes, the
round of a set form is utterly despised; and as ringers in the changes, so
these in their extemporary orisons, go up and down, backward and forward, are
often at a stand, use vain Mat. 6.7.
repetitions prohibited by our Savior, and by clashing phrases, as the Apostle
speaks, make 1 Timothy 1.6.
vain janglings. Suffer, I beseech you, yet one word of exhortation, it shall

corrupt age, and therefore never more need of salt than now, Et vos est is
sal, you are the salt of the commonwealth, as we of the Church, si sal
infatuatus fuerit, if the salt grow unsavory through the corruption of
heresy, bribery, simony, or vicious living, quo salietur? wherewith shall it
be seasoned? I hope it is not so, I pray God it be never so, but that we may
be always like pure and wholesome salt, preserving our selves and others from
corruption. The good will of him who appeared in the fiery bush, salt our
persons with the fire of the Word, Spirit, and seasonable Afflictions, and
season our sacrifices with the salt of faith and discretion, that God may have
always respect to us and our sacrifice for the merits of Christ's infinite
sacrifice offered on the Altar of the Cross. To whom, etc.

THE SPIRITUAL BETHESDA. A Sermon preached at a Christening in Lambeth Church,
the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord Duke of Buckingham being
Godfathers, October 29. Anno Dom. 1619. THE SIXTEENTH SERMON.
MARK 1.9. And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth
of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.


BEing to treat of a subject agreeable to the occasion of our present meeting,
I have made choice of this Scripture, representing unto us the baptism and (if
I may so speak) the christening of Christ himself.

1 Because the baptism of Christ here related by the Evangelist cleansed the
holy Font, and sanctified the river Jordan, and other waters, to the spiritual
ablution of the soul, and fetching out of stains and spots out of the
conscience, not by the infusion of any supernatural quality into the water,
but by annexing a gracious promise to the religious use of the element,
according to his ordinance. For to this end especially (as Saint Aug. Ser. de
temp 30. Non ut sibi munditiem acquireret, sed ut nobis fluenta purgaret.
Austine observes) our Savior would be baptized, To sanctify the Font in
himself, not to cleanse himself in the Font. In which respect we may rightly
term Christ his baptism, baptisma baptismatis, the christening of baptism
it self, in as much as our Lord by the descending into the water, raised it
above it is own pitch, and of a corporal Bath made it a spiritual Laver, of
an earthly Element an heavenly Sacrament; and this I take to be the riches
which that holy Father says Christ put into the river Jordan, in like manner
as the Geographers report, that the Indians yearly throw in a great mass of
gold and silver into the river Ganges. Christ's body, says he, Aug. ser. 1. de
Epiph. Attactu corpora tinguntur, and fluenta ditantur, vitalemque gratiam non
corpus ex flumine, sed flumen mutuatur ex corpore.
was washed, and the stream thereby was enriched; the body received not virtue
from the water, but the water from his body.

2 Because Christ was not baptized for himself, but for us, to wash away that
filth and corruption which we draw from the loins of our parents. As the
cause of his baptism was in us, so the effect was for us; he was baptized
corporally in his natural body, that we might be baptized spiritually in his
mystical. As for himself, his immaculate conception preserved him from
original corruption; and therefore the remedy of baptism, to him in respect
of himself, was needless, on whom the disease neither had nor could fasten:
but as for us he had bin before circumcised, so for us was he now baptized, who
believe and are baptized in his name. So Joh. 17.19. For their sakes I
sanctify myself, that they might be truly sanctified, neither pray I for
these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me throught their word.
himself testifies. As our superfluities were pared off with his knife in
circumcision, so our spots were washed away with water in baptism: by his
baptism of water we are cleansed from original, and by his baptism of blood
in the garden and on the cross, from all our actual sin. When he went
down into the river, he carried our old man with him, and drowned him there
in Jordan. To which point Saint Amb. in Luke Unus mersit, sed lavit omnes, unus
descendit ut ascenderemus omnes, unus omnium peccata suscepit, ut in illo
omnium peccata morerentur.
Ambrose speaks as fully as elegantly; One dived into the water, but he
washed all; one descended that we might all ascend; one took upon him the
sins of all, that he might destroy the sins of all in himself.

3 Because Christ's baptism was the perfect sampler and pattern of ours. For
as Christ was washed with water, so is a Christian. As when Christ was baptized
the Mat. 3.16.17.
three persons in the Trinity manifested themselves, the Father by a voice from
heaven, the Son by the water, the holy Ghost by the dove; so likewise in our
baptism the three persons are expressly mentioned, In the name of the Father,
etc. Lastly, as at Christ's baptism the heavens were opened, and the holy
Spirit descended on our Savior in the similitude of a dove, so at the
christening of the children of the faithful, who are innocent like doves, the
heavens are opened, and the grace of the holy Spirit descends upon them: and
after this their new birth by Water and the Spirit, God acknowledges them for
his Sons. Thus far you hear a perfect concord between Christ's baptism
and ours: but in one circumstance, which I am now to touch upon, there seems
a discord: for Christ was baptized in his perfect age, we in our infancy or
nonage. In those days, says my Luke 3.1.
Evangelist, about the beginning of John's baptism, which was in the fifteenth
year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, verse. 23.
when Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age. At which
circumstance of time the Anabaptists greedily catch, as men that are in danger
of drowning lay hold on flagges, and rotten stakes by the bank side that are
not able to support them. For though Christ were not baptized till he came to
his perfect age, it does not thence ensue that we ought (...) our baptism so
long, or that if we were christened in our infancy, we ought to be baptized
again in our perfect age, when we can give a good account of the hope that is
in us, after the manner of the Anabaptists. For neither was Christ rebaptized,
neither is Christ's case and ours alike. Not therefore to lay much stresse upon
Aquinas his resolution, that Christ was baptized in his perfect age, to show
that baptism makes a man perfect, which is in effect to say, that this delay
of baptism in Christ was of a mystical signification, not for our necessary
imitation. I answer that Christ his example in this case ought to be no
president for us; and that for many reasons:

1 Our Savior in his infancy received circumcision, which then was in stead of
baptism, it being the authentical seal of Gods covenant: and it was not
requisite that two broad seals, if I may so call them, of the King of heaven
should be put to the same deed, at the same time, both being entire. Neither
was it convenient that the figure and the verity, the type and the antitype,
the sacrament of the old and of the new should meet at the same period; but
that there should be a good distance of time between them.

2 Christ needed not baptism at all for himself, being conceived and borne
without sin, and therefore there could be no danger in deferring his baptism
in that regard: but we are conceived and borne in sin, and have no remedy to
heal the leprous contagion of our birrh, but by being washed in this Jordan,
which Christ sanctified by his baptism. Wherefore it is no way safe for us to
put off this sacrament, the only cure of this malady, lest God take us out of
this world whilst our filthy scurfe and sores are upon us.

3 Christ desired not to be baptized of John, to be cleansed thereby, but
either (as I showed before) to sanctify baptism it self, or to receive a
testimony from the Father and from John, and to declare himself to the world;
in which regard he deferred his baptism till the time was come when he
should take off the veil from his face, and suffer the rays of divine majesty
to break forth.

4 Our Font is always open, or ready to be opened, and the Minister attends
to receive the children of the faithful, and dip them in that sacred Laver:
but in Christ's infancy there was neither Baptist nor baptism. Before our
Savior was thirty years of age, either Saint John had not his Commission to
baptize, or at least began not to execute it: but as soon as he took upon
him that holy office, and unsealed the sacred Font, and multitudes came to him
from all parts; In those days came Jesus from Galilee, and was baptized of
John in Jordan.

Having spoken of the substance, Christ's baptism, let us now poize the
circumstances, which are all weighty, and bear down the scale of Christ's
humility to the ground.

1 That Christ in his perfect age should take, if I may so speak, the festraw
into his hand, and be entered in his Primer, and receive the token of the first
admittance into his own school.

2 That he should not expect John to come and tender his service to him, but
should take a long journey to meet with the Baptist.

3 That he should daigne to let him lay his hands on his head, who was not
worthy to Mat. 3.11.
untye his shoe; that the fountain of all christianity, in whose name we are
all baptized, should receive his christendom, as we speak, from another, and
be baptized in the open and common river Jordan. Each of these considerations
adds a degree of descent to our Saviors humility, and consequently a degree
of ascent to his glory. For there is nothing more glorious than for highest
majesty to humble himself in the lowest and lowliest manner. The Plin. in
Panegyr. Curiad summum fastigium nihil superest, is uno modo crescere potest si
se submiserit.
tree that is at the highest pitch can no otherwise grow than downward. 1 If
Christ would be baptized, why not in his infancy? why in his perfect age would
he stoop to the childrens Font, or, to speak more properly, the spiritual
Lazars bath, in those days when he was about thirty years of age? 2 If in
that age he would be baptized, to grace and countenance John's baptism, why
yet did he not send for John to come to him? why did he take a voyage to
John? why did he seek after, and run to his forerunner? Jesus came from
Galilee. 3 If he would take such a journey to be baptized, having no need of
baptism for himself, to fulfill all righteousness for us, why would he not
be baptized by an Luke 2.21. His name was called Jesus, which was so named of
the Angel before he was conceived in the womb.
Angel, who first named him Jesus, but by John his servant? Was baptized of
John. 4 If he would be baptized by a man, the rather to prove his manhood, or
countenance the ministry of man, why gave he not order for some Font of gold
to be made for him, in a princely palace? why would he uncloath himself in
the open air, and go down into the common river Jordan, to be washed there
as an ordinary man? Why all this, but to exalt his glory by humility, and to
teach us to stoop low, when we enter in at the gate of Christ's school?

In those days, etc. Perfection it self in his full age takes the remedy of
our imperfections; Jesus receives baptism. The way it self takes along and
tedious journey; Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee. The Leo ser. de Epiph.
Descendere in se fontem foelix unda miratur.
fountain of all purity is washed, And was baptized. The Lord and author of
baptism receives his own badge and cognizance from his servant, Of John. The
boundless ocean descends into the river, In Jordan. Well might, says
Barradius, the heavens be opened, that the Angels might behold this wonderful
sight. A strange and wonderful baptism indeed, in which he that was washed
was purer than the Font it self, in which the person is not sanctified by the
Sacrament, but the Sacrament by the person. A strange and wonderful baptism,
in which he is baptized with water, who baptizeth with the holy Ghost and with
fire. A strange and wonderful baptism, in which the person baptized is the
Son of God, and the two witnesses the Father and the holy Spirit. A strange
and wonderful baptism, in which not the Church door but heaven gates were
opened, and in stead of a Sermon from the mouth of a mortal man, there was
heard a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well
pleased. Observe, I beseech you, in this and other strains of the sweet
harmony of the Evangelists, how the Bases and Trebles answer one the other; how
where they depresse our Savior most in his humanity, there they raise him
highest in his divinity. In the passages of one and the self same story, where
you find most pregnant proofs of his infirmity and humility as man, there you
have also most evident demonstration of his majesty and glory as God. What
greater humility than to lie for many months in the dark prison of the Virgins
womb, and to be borne of a poor handmaid? this shows him to be a true
man; yet what greater glory than to be conceived of the holy Ghost, and to
have a regiment of heavenly Soldiers, to guard him as it were into the world,
and a quire of Angels to sing at his birth? this demonstrateth him to be God.
What greater argument of his humility than to be borne in an Inn, lodged in a
Stable, and laid in a Manger? this shows him to be virum dolorum, a man in
distress and great necessity; yet what greater glory than to be manifested by
a star, and presented by the Heathen Sages with Gold, Frankincense, and
Myrrh? this demonstrateth him to be God. What greater humility than to be
carried up and down from place to place by Satan, and to be tempted by that
foul fiend? this shows him to be a man; yet what greater glory than to be
attended on, and ministered unto by Mat. 4.11. Then the Devil leaves him, and
behold Angels came and ministered unto him.
Angels in the desert? this demonstrateth him to be God. What greater humility
than to suffer himself to be taken by the high Priests servants armed with
swords and staves against him, as if he had been a Malefactor? this shows
him to be a man, and that of little or no reputation among the Rulers; yet
what greater glory than with the breath of his mouth to cast down those that
assaulted him, and make them fall John 18.6. As soon as he had said unto
them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
backward to the ground, in such sort that he might have trampled them under
his feet? this demonstrateth him to be God. What greater humility than to be
nailed to the cross, and to dye in torments? this shows him to be a mortal
man; yet what greater glory than at his death to eclipse the sun, and obscure
the heavens, and move the earth, and cleave the rocks, and rend the veil of
the Temple from the top to the bottom, and open graves? this demonstrateth
him to be God In like manner here in my text, what greater testimony of
humility, than to descend into the river, and suffer himself to be baptized
by John? yet what greater glory than at his baptism to have the heavens
opened, and the holy Ghost in a visible shape to descend upon him, and God the
Father from heaven to acknowledge him for his Son? this demonstrateth him to
be God. But to bound my self within the eclipticke line of my text, where it
follows, Jesus came from

Nazareth of Galilee. Nazareth was a little town or village in Galilee, where
our Savior dwelt with his parents for many years, and from his abode there
took the appellation of Nazarene. This his country with his person was highly
exalted upon the cross the Trophee of his victory over the world; as appears
by that inscription, Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews. Hieron. de nom Hebr.
Drusius ad voces N. T. comment. Steph. interp. nom. Heb.
Nazareth signifies florem, or virgultum ejus, a flower, or a twigge, derived
from Buxlorf. epit. rad. Natsar surculus, sic dictus quod custodia and cura
egeat, ne a vento dejiciatur aut frangatur.
Natsar, to keep, or warily to look to, because flowers or tender plants need
care, lest they be blown down with a wind, or otherwise wronged. Upon which
grounds Saint Ber. de concept. Christ. Voluit concipiflos in flore intra
florem, id est, intra Nazareth, ut fieret ipse flos florens, id est, Nazarenus.
Bernard thus pleasantly descanteth: The sweet flower of Jesse would be
conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin, a most sweet and unblasted
flower, planted in Nazareth the flower of Galilee, that he might budde and
become a Nazarene, that is, a flourishing flower. I will add no more at this
time of Nazareth, but that as it was said of Archelaus, that Eras. Adag. Non
Euripides ex Archelai, sed Archelaus ex Euripidis amicitia nomen assequutus est.
Euripides was not famous for his acquaintance with Archelaus, but Archelaus
for his acquaintance with Euripides: so for ought I ever read, Christ was not
ennobled by Nazareth, but Nazareth honored, nay rather eternized by Christ's
dwelling in it. This Nazareth is situate in Galilee, where our Lord first
preached the Gospel of the Kingdom, and declared the power of his Deity by
many signs and wonders; and because his Contrymen showed least respect to
his person, and gave least credit to his doctrine, it fell out by the just
judgment of God in the conquest of Palaestine by the Romans, that the
Galileans first smarted for their unbelief, the whole country being spoiled
and laid waste by Vespasian. From Galilee we return with our Savior to
Judaea, where he met John, and was

Baptized of him. At the first mention of our Lords baptism this objection
offers it self to every man's conceit. The whole need not the Physician, but
they that are sick; the clean need not to be washed, but they that are foul;
the innocent need not to ask or receive pardon, but the guilty; why then
should the health and salvation of all mankind take this purge? why should the
immaculate lamb be washed in the Font? why did he desire the seal of
remission of sins, who knew no sin, neither was there guile found in his
mouth? 1 S. Amb. in Luke 2. Baptizatus est Dominus non mundati volens, sed
mundare aquas, ut ablutae per carnem Christi, quae peccatum non novit,
baptismatis jus haberent.
Ambrose answers, that our Lord was baptized, not that he might be cleansed
by the water, but (as was touched before) intending thereby to cleanse and
sanctify the water, that being washed by Christ's flesh, it might thereby be
elevated to be an instrument of the holy Ghost in the spiritual washing of
the soul. 2 Saint Aug. de. bapt. Christ. Ne homines gravarentur ad baptismum
Domini venire, cum Dominus ipse non gravaretur ad baptismum servi venire.
Austine adds that our Savior vouchsafed to be baptized, to draw all men to
Christian baptism; for why should any refuse to come to the Lords baptism,
when the Lord himself daigned to come to the baptism of his servant? 3 Saint
Jerome assigns a third reason of Christ's receiving baptism from John, viz.
that he might ratify, and give authority to Saint John's baptism. 4 Calvin.
haerm. evang. Ut certius sibi persuadeant fideles se in Christi corp, inseri,
and consepeliri cum eo in baptismo, ut in novitate vitae resurgant.
Calvin yields a fourth reason, that the faithful might be more assured
that they are engraffed into Christ, and are buried together with him in
baptism, that they may rise up again with him in newness of life. But our
Saviors reason must stand for all, thus it becomes to fulfill all
righteousness: the righteousness of the law he had fulfilled in that
behalf, in being circumcised the eighth day; and now he began to fulfill the
righteousness of the Gospel. The ceremonial law was in force in Christ's
infancy, which required circumcision; and now the Gospel began to be in
force: after John's baptism circumcision went out, and baptism came in with
John: therefore it was now requisite that Christ should be baptized; But why
should he be baptized of John?

Of John. It had been an office beseeming the first of the Angelical
Hierarchy, to lay hands on the head of the Church: True; but Jesus now came in
humility, and as he was in the form of a servant, so he vouchsafed to be
baptized of a servant. The Lord comes to do honor to his servant, the sun
to be enlightened by a star, the fountain to be washed in his own stream,
the root to receive sap and moisture from the branch, God to receive the
Sacrament from man. This does not more set forth our Lords humility than add
to John's glory. And questionless a special reason that moved our Savior to
receive baptism from Saint John was, to countenance John's ministry, and to
give authority to his fellow laborer, and, if I may so speak, under-workman.
For John brought stones to Jesus, and cut them for the building, and Jesus laid
them in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem, near himself the corner
stone: John rough-hewed the Jews with the axe of Gods judgments threatened
against them, Mat. 3.10. The axe is laid to the root of the tree, etc.
to cut them down and cast them into hellfire, unless they repented; Christ
smoothed and polished them with the doctrine of the Gospel, that they might
be like Psalm. 144.12.
the polished corners of the Temple; or like the Lam. 4.7.
Nazarites, whose polishing was of Sapphire: John washed the sores of wounded
consciences with water, as the Jailer did Act. 16.33.
Paul and Silas stripes of body; Christ healed them with the ointment of the
spirit: John cleansed the inward rooms of the soul by the water of baptism
and penitent tears; Christ strawed the swept rooms with the flowers of
Paradise: John began, Christ finished; John baptized with water, Christ with
the holy Ghost and with fire: Jesus and John resemble the Cherubins in the
Arc, casting a gracious look one upon the other: Alter in alterius jacientes
lumina vultum. Jesus like the sun casts light upon John, and John like a
Crystal glass reflects it upon him. Jesus says of Joh. 5.35.
John he was a burning and shining lamp, John Joh. 1.34.
says of Jesus, This is the Son of God: Jesus testifies of John, that he
was Elias, John of Jesus that he was the Messiah: Jesus points to John,
saying, Mat. 11.9.
Behold a Prophet, yea and more than a Prophet; John to Jesus, saying, Joh.
1.29.
Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world: Jesus
comes to honor John in desiring his baptism; John by putting him back at
the first, honors him the more, saying, I Mat. 3.14.
have need to be baptized of thee, and come thou to me? John says of
Jesus, Mat. 3.11.
I am not worthy to bear his shoes; Jesus says of John in effect, I account
him worthy to lay hands on my head.

I have gone down the four former steps and descents of our Saviors humility,
I am now to descend to the fifth, which was Christ's descending into

Jordan, and his vouchsafing to accept of the water of that common river to
consecrate baptism in his own body. The Ancients, who delighted much in
Acrostickes, wrote for Christ, (...), that is, a Fish: for if you take the
first letters of these words, (...), (Jesus Christ the son of God crucified)
and join them together, they make the word (...). This (...), or mystical Fish
is taken by John in the river Jordan, and that head before which the Cherubins
and Seraphins, Caput tremendum potestatibus inclinatur ab homine.
and all Principalities in heaven bow, is bowed by John on earth, and dipped
under the water in the river Jordan; this the particle (...) intimates, (...),
that is word for word, He was baptized into the river Jordan. Here if you
demand with the curious Schoole-Divines, why Jordan has the honor and
precedencie of all other rivers? why Christ made not choice rather of the Red
sea, to be baptized in it as he fled into Egypt, considering the Red sea was
an evident type of baptism? For as Pharaoh and his host were drowned in the
Red sea, so all our spiritual enemies are destroyed in the Red sea of Christ's
blood, whereof the waters of baptism are a figure. We need not go far for
answer, the words immediately going before may resolve the point in question:
Jesus came to be baptized of John who baptized at this time in Jordan; Christ
chose not John to baptize him for Jordans sake, but Jordan to be baptized in
for John's sake. Howbeit it if you will dive deeper into Jordan, you may find in
it a more remarkable type of baptism than in the Red sea. For as Zeno the
Bishop of Verona long ago observed, the Israelites after they had passed the
Red sea came into the wilderness; but we pass through the Red sea of Christ's
blood over into Paradise. The river Jordan was in the children of Isreal's way
to the land of promise, so is the water of baptism in ours to the celestial
Canaan. Shall I add out of Saint Aug. ser. 2. de Epiph. Sicut aquae Jordanis
conversae sunt transeuntibus Israelitis, Ita Christo baptizato retrorsum
peccata conversa sunt.
Austine, that as the waters of the river Jordan were turned back when the
Israelites passed over it; so at this entry of Christ into Jordan the sins of
all true believers were driven back, and the course of our nature turned
another way? Or out of Aquinas in suplem. Elias divisit aquas Jordanis cum
rapiendus esset in coelum, quia transeuntibus per aquam baptismi, per ignem
Spiritus sancti patet aditus in coelum.
Aquinas, that as Elias after he had divided the waters of Jordan, was carried
up into heaven in a fiery chariot; so after we have parted the waters of the
Font in our baptism, through the fire of the holy Spirit we are carried up,
by divine contemplation first, and after by real ascension into heaven? As I
have sprinkled the waters of Jordan on you in the explication of my text, so
give me leave in the application to rub and cleanse some sores in you with
them.

1 Christ traveled over a great part of Palaestine to Jordan to receive John's
baptism; where are they who will not stir out of doors to receive Christ's
baptism? Jesus came himself to Jordan, they will have Jordan by a secret pipe
conveyed into their private houses. Mistake me not, I beseech you beloved
brethren, I go not about to streighten the bowels of our Mother the Church,
which in great charity and compassion sends the water of life in baptism to
infirm infants, and the bread of life in the other Sacrament to sick persons,
who are not able to fetch them. But when the child is strong, the minister
provided, the congregation assembled, if perchance there fall a drop of rain
to wet their new set ruff, or there lie any dirt in the street to foul their
shoes, upon such or the like slight occasions and frivolous pretenses, to
deprive God of his public worship, the congregation of the spiritual food,
the infant of the benefit of the prayers of the whole assembly argues a great
neglect of the solemn worship of God, and an insufferable wrong to his Church.
The Martyrs heretofore could not be kept from the Church and public ministry
of the Word and Sacraments by fear of haile-shot or bullets; these are kept
from it by a few drops of rain.

2 Jesus was baptized, who are they who slightly esteem baptism? If the
immaculate Lamb were washed in the Font of baptism, how much more ought they
to desire to be cleansed therein, who are fuller of spots than Leopards? If
Christ, says S. Ambros. in Luke Si Christus peccata nostra lavit, quanto magis
nos lavare peccata nostra convenit, si pro nobis Christus lavit, imo nos in
corpore suo lavit, quanto nos magis lavare delicta nostra debemus.
Ambrose, washed for us, nay rather washed us in his own body, how much more
ought we to wash our own sins, original in the laver of our baptism, and
actual in the baptism of tears?

3 Jesus vouchsafed to be baptized of John, a man though of admirable gifts,
and eminent place in the Church, yet in comparison of our Savior he was not
so much as a star of the sixth magnitude to the sun: where are they who
refuse the holy Sacraments from the hands of any minister who is of inferior
place, or of meaner gifts, at least in their account? Does the potion work the
less because the Physician that administreth it is himself crazie? does the
plaster less heal because it is applied by an Apothecary that has a sore
hand? does not the lees or soap scour white which is received from the hand of
a blackmore? is a piece of coin, be it an Angel, or Sovereign, or Jacobus,
of less value if it be tendered by a beggar? They need to be better
catechized, who know not that the effect of the Sacrament depends upon the
power and promise of God, and right form of administering it according to his
Word, and not upon the dignity of the minister.

4 Jesus was baptized in the open and common river Jordan: where are they who
disdain the common Font? No Font will serve them but a Font of gold new made,
or a silver basin with their arms on it. Saint Paul teaches us that the way
to heaven is a hard and rugged, a stony and thorny way, through many
afflictions; these think to go to heaven treading all the way upon rich
carpets, or rose leaves. By their reason Christ the Son of God, and Prince of
heaven should have refused the common river Jordan, and not have received
baptism in any river but such as Ganges or Pactolus, whose sands are said to
be full of rich Ore. Do they think it is pleasant to God to keep state in
their march toward heaven? to receive the Sacrament of Christian humility in
pride? to profess the renouncing of the pompes and vanities of this world, and
in the very profession thereof at the Font to show the pomp and vanity
thereof? Eras. apoph. Plat.
Calcare saeculi fastum majori fastu, for which Plato justly taxed Diogenes.
But the time excludes, and that whereof mine eyes are now witnesses, silenceth
all such otherwise seasonable increpations. For we all see, and rejoice to see
this infant presented by the parents to God in the Temple, and reverently and
modestly brought, without displaying the ensigns of gentility, to holy
baptism; the public ministry is not neglected, the common Font is not
despised. Such an assembly, so honorable, so religious, so full, we rather
pray for than hope for upon the like occasion in this place. Let the honor of
it redound to God, the benefit to the infant to be baptized, that the Peers
of this Kingdom, and other persons of eminent quality, have for a time
absented themselves from the Kings court, and now present themselves in the
Courts of the Lords house to add a Lamb to Christ's flock. Such an illustrious
constellation of so many stars, and some of the first magnitude, has seldom
appeared in this Horizon. What remains, but that we now proceed with joy and
comfort from the Pulpet to the Font, from the Word to the Sacrament, from
feeding our own souls to make a Christian soul? Solin. Polyhist. Fusca
pecora vertit in candida.
Solinus reports of a river in Baeotia that it turns the color of the
sheep that are washed in it, in such sort that if they were before black or
dunne, they become presently as white as milk. That may be a fable, but this
is Gospel, that such is the virtue of the consecrated waters of baptism,
wherein Christ's lambs are usually washed through divine benediction upon this
holy ordinance, that though they were never so black or foul before, yet
after they come out of this laver they are most clean and white, and so
continue till they plunge themselves into the mire of worldly desires and
fleshly lusts. Glorious things may be spoken of thee thou Well of life. O
sacred Font of God, O royal Bath of Christ, O heavenly Laver, O spiritual
Bethesda, infinitely exceeding that wonderful poole in Jerusalem mentioned by
Saint John. For that healed but bodily infirmities, this cures spiritual
maladies; that healed him only that was first let down into it after the
Angel moved the water; this heals all those that are dipped into it, or
sprinkled with it, after the minister, who is Gods Angel, stirs this water:
that received a medicinal virtue for the body, as Saint Jerome conceives,
from the blood of the sacrifices that were washed in it; this receives a
spiritual and divine virtue for the cure of the soul, from the blood of the
immaculate lamb Christ Jesus. For his blood cleanses us from all our sins. In
other waters, as Zeno notes, living creatures are cast in alive, and after
they are held a good while under the water, or sink down of themselves, are
taken out dead: but contrariwise, in the sacred Font children are dipped in
dead, to wit, in trespasses and sins, but are taken out alive, alive to God,
enlived by his spirit, quickened by his grace. This life of grace God grant to
the infant now to be metriculated into the University of all Saints, and
continue it in us all, that Christ may live in us here by grace, and we for
evermore live with him hereafter in glory. To whom, etc.

THE LIVING TEMPLE. A Sermon preached at the Readers Feast in the Temple
Church. THE SEVENTEENTH SERMON.
2 COR. 6.16. For ye are the Temple of the living God.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
COnsecrate your hearts to the service of God, and dedicate your ears to his
holy Word, For ye are the Temple of the living God. If the heathen Orator
making an Oration in aede Concordiae (a Temple consecrated to their goddess
Concord) used the place for a Topic, and drew an argument from the house
inscription where they met, to persuade peace and concord: and the Apostle
himself took the advantage of the title of an Altar at Athens to declare unto
them the true God, whom Act. 17.23. I found an altar with an inscription, To
the unknown God.
they ignorantly worshipped: and in his Epistle to Philemon alludeth to the
name of his unthrifty servant (...) ab (...) prosum. Phile. v. 11. I beseech
thee for my son Onesimus, which in times past was to thee unprofitable, but
now profitable to thee and to me.
Onesimus, assuring him that howsoever in former time he had been
unprofitable, yet that he should now prove (...), according to his name
Onesimus, profitable to both of them: I persuade my self it will not be
offensive to you to hear a lecture read upon your name, and many holy duties
enforced from the sacred appellation in my text, wherewith your honorable
society is graced, that you may be indeed what you are called, The Temple of
the living God.

This text of the Temple admits of a like division to the partition of the
Temple of Solomon, which was into three rooms or spaces: 1 Atrium, the outward
court. 2 Sanctum, the holy place. 3 Sanctum sanctorum, the holy of holies.
1 In the outward court the people stood. 2 In the holy place the Priests
offered their daily sacrifice. 3 In the holy of holies the high Priest appeared
once a year.
1 Ye are, resembles the outward court, where the people were. 2 Temple, the
holy place. 3 The living God, the most holy. The Temple of God is holy, but the
God of the Temple is infinitely more holy.


In passing through these spaces and partitions, let the eye of your religious
observation fall upon 1 The proper title of the Elect, Temple. 2 The proper
owner of the Temple, God. 3 The proper attribute of God, Living.
1 For expresses and presses a reason, What agreement, etc. For. 2 Ye
specifieth the persons. 3 Are points to the time. 4 The Temple is the title
of Gods children. 5 Of God is added for distinction of Temples. 6 Living is
adjoined for distinction of Gods.
1 There are many who deserve to be called cages of unclean birds, or rather
styes of unclean beasts, than Temples, Ye are the Temple. 2 There are Temples
of Idols, or rather Devils, not of God, Ye are the Temple of God. 3 There are
gods not living, Ye are the Temple of thee living God.


Here is a sweet cluster of the grapes of the vine of Engaddi.

1 Press the first grape, and it will yield this liquor, That Christians may
not communicate with Idolaters, nor consort with profane persons: For.

2 Press the next grape, and it will yield this juice, That holiness to God
is the Imprese of the regenerate: Ye.

3 Press the third, it yields this, That there are Saints upon earth, viz.
in truth and sincerity, though not in perfection: Are.

4 Press the fourth, it yields this, That the whole company of true
believers make but one Holy Catholic Church; Temple not Temples: The Temple.

5. Press the fifth, it yields this, That reverence is due to the servants of
God, that sanctity is in them, and safety with them. Of God. The Temple of God
carries with it all three: and to whom indeed is due more reverence, in whom
shines more sanctity, with whom is found more safety than Gods secret ones,
who as stones coupled together, and built upon the corner stone Christ Jesus,
rise up toward heaven, and become a holy temple of God?

6. Press the last, and it yields this, That the God whom we Christians
serve is the only true living God, and source and fountain of all life; which
he conveigheth to us in a threefold channel, 1 The broader of nature: 2 The
narrower of grace: 3 The overflowing and everspringing of glory.


For: The reason stands thus. Separate your selves from wicked and profane
persons, For ye are a Temple. Secondly, keep your selves from dead and dumb
Idols, For ye are the Temple of the living God.

(For) perforce draws us from all familiar company and intimate conversation
with men of a lewd, dissolute or profane carriage; Ephesians. 5.11.
Have no fellowship with them, says the Apostle: elsewhere, Act. 2.40.
Save your selves from them, says Saint Peter: Come out from among them, and
be you 2. Cor. 6.17, 18.
separate, and I will be a Father unto you, and you shall be my Sons and
Daughters. It was an abomination by the Law to touch any dead thing, Lev. 22.4.
Whosoever touches any thing that is unclean by the dead, etc. and are not
they that live in pleasure and sensuality 1 Timothy 5.6.
dead while they are alive? but she that lives in pleasure is dead whilst
she lives. She is no loyal wife that delights in company disliked by her
husband, though but upon suspicion. How can the son but incur his fathers
displeasure, who entertaineth such guests with all love and kindness whom his
father hates, and forbids them his house? Those who are of worth seek to
preserve their credit and good name as a precious ointment, which is soon
corrupted by the impure air of nasty society. For such a man is deservedly
esteemed to be, with whom he ranketh himself: but corrupting the soul is
far worse than tainting a good name; and who is there almost that comes
fair off from foul company? he cannot but learn evil by them, or Epictet.
(...).
suffer evil of them. Man in Paradise might be like the plants of Paradise, of
which Athanasius reports that they imparted an aromaticall savor to the
trees near adjoining: but since man was cast out, the corruption of his nature
makes him resemble rather the wan and withered vine in the Poet, which took
away the fresh color and sap from the neighbor vine; Juven. sat. 1. Dedit
haec contagio labem, etc.
Uvaque livorem conspecta ducit ab uva.

It is true, Bonum est sui diffusivum, Goodness is of a communicative nature;
but since our fall we are not so capable of receiving good as evil. The
example of an evil man sooner corrupts a good man, than a good example
converteth an evil man. The weak and watery eye is not strengthened by
looking on a quick or strong eye; but on the contrary, many a strong and dry
eye by looking on a watery eye waters it self. The sound man by lying with the
sick loses his health, yet the sick man by lying with the whole man gains
not his health; the exchange is not mutual. If you mingle bright and rusty
metal together, the rusty will not become bright by it, but on the contrary
the bright rusty; so, says Senec. ep. 7. Rubiginosus comes etiam candido suam
affricuit rubiginem.
Seneca, a rusty companion rubbeth some of his rust upon a man of fair
conditions, yet the man of fair conditions imparteth none of his candor to the
rusty. The diseases of the mind are more taking than the diseases of the body;
let us therefore take heed how we come within the breath of a man who is of a
rotten heart, and corrupt conscience. If Joseph living in Pharaohs Court
learned to swear by the life of Pharaoh, and the people of God being mingled
with the heathen learned their works: beware how you touch pitch lest you be
defiled, and bird-lime lest you be entangled. Socrates was wont to say to
Alcibiades, sometime the paragon of beauty both of body and mind, when he met
him among Gallants like himself, I fear not thee but thy company: and Saint
Aug. confess. l. 2. c. 9. Eamus, faciamus, pudet non esse impudentem.
Austine in his Confessions with tears complains of the hellish torrent of
evil company, wherewith he was carried away oftentimes, and fell into many a
dangerous gulf: I had not the power to stay my self, says he, when they
called; Eamus, faciamus, Let us go, let us do some noble exploit, or brave
pranke of youth: nay, they so far wrought upon me, that I was ashamed of my
shamefaced modesty, and blushed that I was not past blushing. You that are Gods
chosen make choice of your company, let all your delight be, with holy David,
Psalm. 16.3.
in such as excel in virtue, and have holiness to the Lord engraven in their
breasts. For ye are Temples, therefore be ye separate from profane persons.

Ye are the Temples of the living God, meddle not therefore with dumb and dead
Idols. If Idolatry be the spirits adultery, and Gods wrath against Idolaters
is jealousy, and his jealousy burns like fire down to the bottom of hell;
I shall not need by arguments to deter any understanding Christian from
coming within the verge of so dangerous an impiety, the guilt whereof lies
not only upon those whose souls and bodies have been agents in Idols
services, but also all those who by any speeches, acts, signs, or outward
gestures, give any allowance or countenance thereunto. Amb. ep. 31. Pollui se
putabat si aram vidisset.
Constantine the Emperor thought himself defiled if he had but seen an
heathenish altar: Psalm. 16.4.
David if he had but made mention of an Idol; their offerings of blood I will
not offer, nor take their names into my mouth. Saint Paul permitted not the
Corinthians to taste of any dainties that were served in at the Idols table.
Let them therefore beware of some fearful judgment of God, who without any
calling or commission, out of mere curiosity, enter into the house of Rimmon,
and behold those Idolatrous rites wherewith Romish superstition has corrupted
the pure worship of God. How can they be there with them without offense? If
they join not with these Idolaters in censing, bowing before, offering unto,
and kissing their Images, in calling upon Saints, and praying for the releasing
of souls out of Purgatory, they give offense to them: if they join with them,
they give greater offense to the Church of God, and not only receive a Hom.
against rebellion the Pope is called the Babylonish beast.
mark from the beast, but a grievous wound. The Corinthians, whom S. Paul in
these words plucks, as it were, violently out of the idols Temple, had as
colorable a pretense as these Naamans can have. They pleaded that they went not
to the idols temple to worship, but to make merry with their neighbors, and
feed their bellies with the idols relics; these in like manner say that they
resort not to places where Masses are said to worship the wafer, or breaden
god, but to feed their eyes with their garish shows, and please their ears
with their exquisite music. They proceeded farther in their defense,
alleging that they knew the idol was nothing, and in their eating of things
offered to it, they had no relation to the Paynim deity, nor purpose to worship
it, but the true God, whose creatures they received with cheerfulness and
thanksgiving. And is not this the fairest gloss they set upon their foul and
scandalous practice in pressing into Popish chapels, that they know the
sacrifice of the Mass is nothing, neither do they any reverence at all to
image or picture, but to God, to whom they pray against those superstitions
even when they are at them? But what does the Apostle answer to the
Corinthians? viz. That though the idol be nothing in it self, yet since it is
a supposed Deity in the mind of the Idolater, who intends a religious
worship thereunto, in keeping those heathenish feasts, a Christian may not
join with him in the outward action of his idol service (whatsoever the
intention be) without receiving a foul stain both in his conscience and in
his good name. To lift up the heart to God when they fall down with their body
before the Host or Image, will no more acquit them from idolatry, than it will
clear a woman from adultery to think upon her husband when she prostituteth
her body to the impure soliciter of her chastity. Neither is it easy to sever
the soul from the body in one and the self same act, as Aug. confess. l. 6.
c. 8. Alypius ab amicis violenter in amphitheat um adductus, dicens, si corpus
meum in illum locum trahitis, numquid and animum? adero itaque absens, and sic
and vos and illa superabo: ille diuclausis oculorum foribus, interdixit animae
ne in tanta mala procederet, utinam and aures obturasset, nam quodam pugnae
casu curiositate victus, aperuit oculos, and percussus est graviore vulnere in
anima quam ille in corpore.
Alypius found by his woeful experience; who being violently drawn by his
friends into the Roman Theater, thus reasoned with himself: What though you
have drawn my body into this place? you shall not draw my soul: seeing you
will have it so, I will stay with you, but I resolve to be absent when I am
present, and so I will deceive you and them. According to which his firm
purpose, he kept the liddes of his eyes shut, that his soul might not, as it
were, go out of them, and gad after these vanities: And it had been happy for
him, says Saint Austine, if he had locked up the gates of his ears also; for
on the sudden hearing a great shout and applause, ere he was aware he
opened his eyes, and by seeing that bloody spectacle received a deeper wound in
his soul than the hurt Fencer in his body. Is it not to be feared that as the
Genesis 30.39. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
cattle ring streked, speckled, and spotted.
sheep which conceived before the colored rods brought forth spotted
lambs, so the prayers and meditations which are conceived before idols, will
receive some impression from the image, and be tainted with idolatry, or
spotted with superstition? Was it unlawful for the Corinthians to partake with
idolaters in meats offered unto idols, and can it be lawful for these men to
communicate with Papists in prayers offered unto them? If they answer, they
pray to Saints, and before images and not idols; let them know that any image
or creature to which religious worship is given, thereby becomes an idol. If
Saint Cyprians zeal transported him not too far, when he peremptorily
determines there can be no society between faith and perfidiousnesse, or
between the true and false worship of God. If the 2 Cor. 6.14. What fellowship
has righteousness with unrighteousness? etc.
Apostle allows of no more communion between Christians and Idolaters than
between righteousness and unrighteousness, or light and darkness, or Ver.

Christ and Belial; certainly all Interimists, and Pseudo-Cassanders, and
catholic Moderators of these times, who go about to bring Christ and
Antichrist to an enterview, sodder unity and schism, piece faith and heresy,
and make the Whore of Babylon and Christ's spouse good friends, are like to have
a hard task of it. For what agreement has the Temple of God with Idols? but
ye are the Temple of God.

Ye. The light of the sun is common unto all, but not his influence: in like
manner there are certain enlightening gifts which are not denied to the
unregenerate, but the sanctifying, and saving graces of the spirit are peculiar
to Gods children. God forbids in the Law the anointing any thing with the
holy Exodus 30.33.

holy ointment to any common use, and shall we think that he will shed the
ointment of his spirit into any impure or profane heart? will he cast his
pearl before swine? The piety of Paynims is Necromancy or Idolatry, of
Heretics is Will Worship, of Hypocrites is Formality, of Schismatics is
Faction. There can be no true devotion without illumination of the
understanding, and renovation of the will, and purifying the heart by faith;
there is no Temple of God which is not built upon the corner stone Christ
Jesus. Ye, and none but such as ye are. The Church in the song of Solomon is

regeneration of grace, Saints by daily renovation of the inward man, Saints by
devotion and dedication of themselves wholly to God, Saints by inhabitation of

there we shall dwell with him, and have fullness of all things, yet without
satiety or being cloyed therewith.

The Temple. Not the Temples, but the Temple. Genesis 1.1. (...)
As the learned Hebricians from the construction of the noune plural with a
verb singular, as if you would say in Latin, Dii or Numina creavit, gather the
trinity of persons in the unity of the divine nature; so from the construction
here of a singular adjunct with a subject plural, we may infer the
plurality of the faithful in the unity of the Church. For we that are many
yet are truly one, many grains one bread, many sheep one fold, many members
one body, many branches one vine, many private oratories or chaplets but one
Temple. The parts of the Catholic Church are so far scattered and dissevered
in place that they cannot make one material, yet they are so near joined in
affection, and fast linked with the bonds of religion, that they make but one
spiritual Temple. They are many souls, and must needs have as many diverse
natural bodies; yet in regard they are all quickened, guided, and governed by
the same spirit, they make but one mystical body, whose head is in heaven, and
members dispersed over the earth. Can unity be divided? If we are rent in
sunder by schism and faction, Christ his seamelesse coat cannot cover us all.
The Philosophers find it in the natural, the Statesmen in the politic, and
I pray God we find it not in the mystical body of Christ, Cyp. de simplic.
prel. A velle radium a sole, divisionem lucis unitas non capit, ab arbore
frange ramum, fructum germinare non poterit, a font praecide rivum, prorsus
arescet.
That division tends to corruption, and dissolution to death. Pluck a beam if
you can from the body of the sun, it will have no light; break a branch from
the tree, it will bear no fruit; sever a river from the spring, it will soon
be dried up; cut a member from the body, it presently dies; cast a pumice
stone into the water, and though it be never so big, while it remains
entire, and the parts whole together, it will swim above water, but break it
into pieces, and every piece will sink: in like manner the Church and
Commonwealth, which are supported, and as it were borne up above water by
unity, are drowned in perdition by discord, dissension, schism, and faction.
It is not possible that those things which are knit by a band, should hold fast
together after the band it self is broken. How can a sinew hold steady the
joint if it be sprayned, or broken, or cut in sunder? Religion (beloved
brethren) is the band of all society, the strongest sinew of Church or
Commonwealth; God forbid there should be any rupture in this band, any sprayne
in this sinew. The husbandman has sowed good seed, clean and picked in this
Kingdom for more than threescore years, and it has fructified exceedingly
since the happy reformation of Religion in these parts; O let no envious man
sow upon it those tares which of late have sprung up in such abundance in our
neighbor countries, that they have almost choked all the good wheat. Let no
root of bitterness spring up in our Paradise, or if it be sprung, let
authority, or at least Christian charity pluck it up. We are all one body,
let us all have the same mind toward God, and endeavor to the utmost of our
power to Ephesians. 4 3.
preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, that our spiritual
Jerusalem may resemble the old Byzantium, the stones whereof were so matched,
and the wall built so uniformely, that the whole City seemed to be but one
stone continued throughout. It was the honor of the Psalm. 122.3. Jerusalem is
builded as a City that is compacted together.
old, let it be also of the new Jerusalem, that it is a City at unity in it
self.

Porch, let us now enter into the Temple. Glorious things are spoken of you, O
ye chosen of God, ye are termed vessels of honor, lights of the world, a
chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a peculiar people, a celestial
society; yet nothing ever was or can be more spoken to Your endless comfort,
and superexcellent glory, than that you are Children of the Father, Members of
the Son, and Temples of the holy Ghost. Seneca calls the world,
Augustissimum Dei Templum, a most magnificent Temple of God; David, the heaven;
Solomon, the Church; Saint Paul, the Elect in the Church; and in a sense not
altogether improper, we may term the world, the Temple of the Church, the
Church the Temple of our bodies, our bodies the Temples of our souls, and our
souls most peculiarly the Temples of the living God: because God dwells and
remains in our souls, our souls in our bodies, our bodies in the Church, the
Church in the world. There are many other reasons of this appellation, but the
Apostle dwells most upon this of dwelling. Where God dwells there is his
Temple, but he dwells in our hearts by faith, we are therefore his Temple. If
exception be made to this reason, that dwelling proves a House, but not a
Temple, Call. in hunc locum. De homine si dicatur hic habitat, non erit protinus
templum, sed domus prophana, sed in Deo hoc speciale est, quod quemcunque locum
sua dignatur praesentia, eum sanctificat.
Calvin answers acutely, that if we speak of the habitation of a man, we
cannot from thence conclude that the place where he abides is a Temple: but
God has this privilege, that his presence makes the place wheresoever he
resideth necessarily a Temple. Whereas the King lies there is the Court, and
where God abides there is the Church. It might be said as truly of the stable
where Christ lay, as of the place where God appeared to Jacob, This is the
house of God, and the gate of heaven. Here I cannot but break out into
admiration with Solomon, and say, 1 Kin. 8.27.
The heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, O Lord, and will thou dwell in my
house, in the narrow room of my heart? Isocrates answered well for a
Philosopher, to that great question, What is the greatest thing in the least?
Isoc. ad Them. (...).
The mind, said he, in man's body. But Saint Paul teaches us to give a better
answer, to wit, God in man's soul. And how fitly he terms here believers
the Temple of God, will appear most evidently by paralleling the inward and
outward Temple of God, the Church and the soul.

1 First, Churches are places exempt from legal tenures and services, and
redeemed from common uses: in like manner the mind of the faithful and devout
Christian is after a sort sequestered from the world, and wholly dedicated to
God.

2 Secondly, Temples are hallowed places, not by censing, or crossing, or
burning tapers, or healing it over with ashes, and drawing the characters of
the Greek and Hebrew Alphabet, after the manner of popish consecration; but by
the Joh. 17.17.
Word and Prayer, by which the faithful are also consecrated. Sanctify them,
O Lord, with thy truth, thy Word is truth.

3 Thirdly, Temples are places of refuge and safety; and where more safety than
in the household of faith? God spared the City for the Temples sake, and he
spares the whole world for the Elects sake.

4 Fourthly, the Temple continually sounded with vocal and isntrumental
music; there was continual joy, singing, and praising God: and does not the
Apostle teach us that there is Ephesians. 5.19.
joy in the holy Ghost, and continual melody in the hearts of believers?

5. Fifthly, in the Temple God was to be Phil 3.3.
worshipped: and Christ teaches that the true John 4.24.
worshippers of God worship him in spirit and in truth: and Saint Paul
commands us to 1 Cor. 6.20.
worship and glorify God in our body and spirit, which are his.

6. Sixthly, do not our feet in some sort resemble the foundation, our legs
the pillars, our sides the walls, our mouth the door, our eyes the windows,
our head the roof of a Temple? Is not our body an emblem of the body of the
Church, and our soul of the queere or chancell, wherein God is, or should be
worshipped day and night? The Temple of God is not lime, sand, stone, or
timber, says Lact. divin. instit. l. 5. c. 8. Templum Dei non sunt ligna and
lapides, sed homo qui Dei figuram gestat, quod Templum non auro, and gemmarum
donis, sed virtutum muneribus ornatur.
Lactantius, but man bearing the image of God: and this Temple is not adorned
with gold or silver, but with divine virtues and graces.

If this be a true definition of a Temple, and description of the Ornaments
thereof, they are certainly much to be blamed, who make no reckoning of the
spiritual Temple of God, in comparison of the material: who spare for no cost
in imbellishing their Churches, and take little care for beautifying their
souls: Hoc oportet facere, and illud non omittere; they do well in doing the
one, but very ill in not doing the other. It will little make for the glory of
their Church to paint their rood-lofts, to engrave their pillars, to carve
their timber, to gild their altars, to set forth their crosses with jewels and
precious stones, if they want that precious pearl which the rich Merchant man
sold all that he had to buy: to have golden miters, golden vessels, Mat. 13.46.
golden shrines, golden bells, golden snuffers and snuffe-dishes, if as
Boniface of Mentz long ago complained, Their Priests are but wooden or leaden.
Saint Amb. Auro non placent quae auro non emuntur. Jnven. sat. 11. Fictilis and
nullo violatus Jupiter auro.
Ambrose says expressly, That those things please not God in, or with gold,
which can be bought with no gold. In which words he does not simply condemn
the use of gold or silver in the service of God, no more than Saint 1 Pet. 3.3.
Peter does in the attire of godly Matrons, (Whose adorning let it not be that
outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and wearing of gold, or of putting on
of apparel: but let it be in the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which
is in the sight of God of great price,) but he and Lactantius both speak
comparatively, and their meaning is, that the chief adorning of Churches is not
with the beauty of colors, but of holiness: not with the luster of pearls
and precious stones, but with the shining of good works: not with candles and
tapers, but with the light of the Word: not with sweet perfumes, but with a
savor of life unto life. It will be to little purpose to stick up wax
lights in great abundance in their Churches, after they have put out the pure
light of Gods Word, or hid it as it were under a bushel in an unknown tongue.
Rhenamus reports that he saw at Mentz two Cranes standing in silver, into
the belly whereof the Priests by a device put fire and frankincense so
artificially, that all the smoke and sweet perfume came out at the Cranes
beakes. A perfect emblem of the peoples devotion in the Romish Church: the
Priests put a little fire into them, they have little warmth of themselves, or
sense of true zeal: and as those Cranes sent out sweet perfumes out at their
beaks, having no smelling at all thereof themselves; so these breath out the
sweet incense of zealous prayers and thanksgiving, whereof they have no sense
or understanding at all, because they pray in an unknown tongue.

And so from the holy place, the Temple, I come to the Holy of holies, the
owner of this holy place, the

Living God. The Apostle so styles God here in my Text, to terrify the
Corinthians from provoking him either to jealousy by their Idolatry, or to
anger by their impure conversation with the Gentiles; whose gods were dead and
senseless stocks, not able to apprehend, much less revenge any wrong offered
unto them by their worshippers; and therefore they might be bold with them, as
the Philosopher was with Hercules, putting him to his thirteenth labor in
seething his dinner: and Martial with Priapus, in threatening to throw him in
the fire if he looked not well to his trees: and Eras. apoph. l. 5. Jovi
Olympio detraxit magni ponderis amiculum, dicens, aestare grave, hyeme
frigidum: Aesculapii auream barbam detraxit, quod negaret decorum patrem
Apollinem imberbem, ipsum barbatum conspici.
Dyonisius with Aesculapius, in cutting off his golden beard, alleging for it,
that it was not fit the son should have a beard seeing the Father had none:
but let Christians take heed of the least provocation of the living God, Heb.
12.29.
for he is a consuming fire. A child may play at the hole of a dead
cockatrice, and a silly woman may strike a dead lion, but who dares handle a
live serpent, or play with the paw of a ramping and roaring lion? how much more
fearful by infinite degrees a thing is it to fall into the hands of the living
God, who with the breath of his mouth is able to blow down the whole frame of
nature, and destroy all creatures from the face of the earth! There is spirit
and life in this attribute living, which comprehends in it all that we can
comprehend, and all that we cannot comprehend of the Deity. For the life of
God is his being, and his being is his nature, and his nature is all things.
When we call upon the living God, we call upon the true God, the everlasting
God, the Father of spirits, the Author of life, the Almighty, All-sufficient,
All-working God; and what is not comprised in all these? The more excellent the
nature is of any thing, the more excellent is the life thereof: as is the life
of beasts than of trees, of men than of beasts, of Angels than of men. What
then may we conceive of the life of God himself? from whence he has his
name in Greek, (...): and because it is his chiefest attribute, he most
frequently swears by it in holy Scripture, As I live says the Lord.

This attribute, living, is applied to God in a threefold regard:

1. To distinguish him from the false gods of the Gentiles, which were dead and
senseless stocks, bearing for the most part the image of a dead man, deified
after death.

2. To represent unto us the sprightly and actuous nature of God, which is
always in action, and ever moving in it self.

3. To direct us to the Fountain of life, from whom all life is derived into
the creature by a threefold stream, of 1 Nature, 2 Grace, 3 Glory.


1 First, the true God is styled the living God in opposition to the heathen
Idols, which were without life, sense, or motion: they had eyes and saw not,
ears and heard not, hands and handled not; whereas the true God has no eyes,
yet sees; no ears, yet hears; no hands, yet works all things. The heathen
Idols were carried upon men's shoulders, or camels backs, as the Prophet Esa.
46.1.2.3.
Esaias excellently describes the manner of their procession: but contrariwise,
the true God bears his children, and supporteth them from the womb even to
their old age, and gray hairs. Mothers and nurses carry children but for a
short space, God bears his children all the days of their life. The heathen
gods, as Saint L. 1. de civit. Dei, Neque enim homines a simulachtis, sed
simulachra ab hominibus servabantur, quomodo vero colebantur ut patriam
custodirent and cives, quae suos non valuere custodire custodes?
Austine observes in the siege of Troy, saved not them that worshipped them,
but were saved by them from fire and spoil; whereupon he infers, What
folly was it to worship such gods for the preservation of the city and
country, which were not able to keep their own keepers? but the true God
preserves them that serve him, and hides them under the shadow of his wings.

2 God is called the living God, because he is all life, he understands and
wills, decrees and executes, begins and ends, observes and orders,
appoints and effects all things: he whirleth about the heavens, raises
storms and tempests, thundering and lightning in the air, he moves upon the
waters, and shakes the pillars of the earth, he turns about the whole frame
of nature, and sets all creatures on work: in a word, as Trismegistus
excellently expresses this truth, (...), and (...).
He potentiateth all acts, and actuateth all powers.

3 Living, because he gives life to all that enjoy it, and preserves also it
in them to the period thereof set by himself. All other living creatures, as
they have but one soul, so they have but one life: man to whom diverse
Philosophers assign three souls, has a threefold kind of life, 1
Vegetative, 2 Sensible, 3 Reasonable.


But over and above, every faithful man has an estate of three lives in Gods
promises: 1 The life of nature (which implies the former three) at our
entrance into the world. 2 The life of grace at our entrance into the Church, 3
The life of glory at our entrance into Heaven.


Nature is the perfection of every creature, grace the perfection of nature,
glory the perfection of grace. The life of nature is given to us to seek the
life of grace, which brings us to the life of glory. That God is the author
of the life of nature, nature her self teaches; Act. 17.28. In him we live,
etc. as some of your Poets have said.
In ipso vivimus, In him we live, move, and have our being. That he is the
author of the life of grace, Saint John, whose name signifies grace,
testifies; Joh. 1.2.
In ipso vita erat, In him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the
light shined in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. Lastly, that
he is the author of the life of glory, Christ who is the way, the truth, and
the life, declares, s^ying, Jo^. 11.25.
I am the resurrection and the life, whosoever believes in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live. There remains nothing to the illustration of
this point, but the removing of an objection which somewhat cloudeth the truth.
For thus a man may argue; If God, as the Prophet speaks, is the Well of life,
in which there are the three springs abovenamed, one above the other, then is
life conveyed to all creatures according to the capacity of their nature, and
consequently all may truly and properly be said to live; how then is life
appropriated to God, and God by this attribute, living, distinguished not only
from fained deities, which were no creatures, but also from creatures which are
not God? I grant that other creatures live, and that truly and properly. For
the Angels live in heaven, the Birds in the air, the Fishes in the sea, Men
and Beasts in the earth, the Devil and damned ghosts in hell; but none of them
live the life of God: their life differs as much from his, as their nature
from his.

1 His life is his nature, theirs the operation of their nature; the life of
Angels is their contemplation, of Devils is their torment, of Men is their
action, of Beasts their s^^e and motion, of Plants their growth; in brief, He
is life, they are but living.

2 His life is his own, he lives of himself, and by himself, and in
himself; their life is borrowed from him, as all light is from the sun.

3 His life is infinite, without beginning or ending; their life is finite, and
had a beginning, and most of them shall have an end, and all might, if he had
so pleased.

4 His life is entire altogether, and perfect, theirs imperfect, growing by
addition of days to days, and years to years.

5 His li^e is immutable, theirs mutable, and subject to many alterations and
chang^s.

To dr^w toward an end; you hear what You are, not profane or common houses,
but the Temple; not the Temple of Devils, but of God, ye^ the living God: mark
I beseech you what will ensue upon it.

house, the house fell down: so soon as the Christians were safe at Pella out
of Jerusalem, Jerusalem was destroyed. The house of Obed-Edom was blessed for
having the Arc in it; and thrice happy are those houses which have many of
these Temples in them.

3 If Gods chosen are his most holy Temple, they must not admit Idolaters into
their communion, nor profane persons into their houses; for this were to set
open the Church of Christ to Belial, and to entertain Gods enemies in his own
house.

4 Are our bodies and souls the Temple, and our faculties and members the
Chapels of the holy Ghost? how holy then ought we to be in our inward and
outward man? how pure in our souls, and clean in our bodies? What a horrible
and abominable thing were it for a man to do any notorious villainy, or commit
any filthiness in the Church upon the Communion Table? the savage Goths, and
barbarous Infidels would not do so wickedly. Can we possibly believe that we
are the Temple of the living God, if we be so dissolute, and impure, and
profane as some are? Know we not that so often as we swear vainly, and use
curses and execrations, we profane Gods Temple? so often as we draw blood of
our brother we pollute it? so often as we corrupt him we destroy it? so often as
we defile our bodies with fornication, or our souls with Idolatry, we commit
filthiness, and practice wickedness in the Temple of God, in the presence of
God, even under his eye? Men and brethren, in this case what shall we do? for
who has not in some kind or other polluted Gods holy Temple, his soul and
body? Lactantius gives us the best counsel that may be, Lact. de ira Dei, c.
ult.
Mundemus hoc Templum, Let us cleanse and purify this Temple which we have
defiled. You will say, How is this to be done? Gorrham answers you out of the
Law.

1 The pavement, according to the rites prescribed by Moses, was to be broken
up, and all dead men's bones cast out: let us in like manner break up the
ground of the heart, and cast all dead works out of our consciences.

2 It was to be swept all over, and washed: let us in like manner wash our
inward Temples with tears, and cleanse them with hearty repentance, and godly
sorrow for our sins.

3 It was to be sprinkled with blood: let us in like manner through faith
sprinkle our consciences with the blood of the Lamb.

4 It was to be perfumed with sweet odours and incense: let us in like manner
perfume our inward Temple with zealous prayers, and sighs for our sins. When
God shall see his Temple thus purified, his house thus prepared for him, he
will return into it, and dwell in it again, and take delight in it, and
enrich it daily more and more. I will lock up the gates of this Temple with
the golden Key of Lact. l. de ira Dei, c. ult. Sit Deus in nobis, non in
templo, sed in cord consecratus; mundemus hoc templum, quod non fumo nec
pulvere, sed malis cogitationibus sordidatur; quod non cereis ardentibus, sed
claritate and luce sapientiae illuminatur; in quo si Deum semper crediderimus
habere praesentem, cujus divinitati secreta mentis pateant, ita vivamus ut
propitium semper habeamus, and nunquam vereamurs iratum.
Lactantius: Let God be consecrated, or set up by us, not in the Temple, but
in our hearts, and let us carefully cleanse this Temple, which is soyled and
blacked, not with smoke and dust, but with impure thoughts and earthly
desires: which is not enlightened with burning tapers, but with the light and
brightness of wisdom: in which if we believe that God is continually
present, to the beams of whose divine eyes the inmost Closets of all hearts
lie open: let us so live that we may ever enjoy his favor, and never fear
his wrath.

Gracious Lord, who have placed thy Tabernacle in the midst of us, in our
hearts, consecrate them, we beseech thee, for holy Temples unto thee; sprinkle
them with thy blood, cleanse them by thy grace, enlighten them with thy Word,
sanctify them with thy Spirit, adorn them with thy gifts, and fill them with
thy glory. O thou who dwell in the highest heavens, come down and visit thy
lower houses, our bodies and souls, dedicated unto thee, take a lodging with
us for a while in our earthly Tabernacles; and when we must leave them, receive
thou us into thine everlasting habitations. So be it. etc.

Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
I Find this Aphorism in the prime Writers of our common laws, Gladius gladium
juvat, the one sword steeds the other: whereby is meant that the
Ecclesiastical and Temporal powers mutually aid and assist each other; that
Canons improve laws, and laws corroborate canons; that where the arm of the
secular Magistrate is short in civil punishments, the ecclesiastical
lengtheneth it by inflicting Church censures; and again, where the
ecclesiastical arm is weak, the secular strengthens it by executing
corporal punishments upon such delinquents as stand out in contempt of
spiritual. The like may be said of the Ephesians. 6.17.
spiritual and military sword, Gladius gladium exacuit, the one whets and
sharpens the other. For the word of God, which is the sword of the spirit, by
divine exhortations and promises sets such an edge upon the material, that Gods
men of war therewith easily cut in pieces the armor, and put to flight or
death the armies of the Heb. 11.34. Out of weakness were made strong, waxed
valiant in fight, put to flight the armies of the Aliens.
Aliens. The Jews never acquitted themselves so worthily, nor fought so
victoriously, as when they received their armor out of the Temple from the
Priests hands: and after Constantine the great having seen a vision in the
air, and heard a voice from Heaven, In hoc signo vinces, set the cross upon
the Eagle in his Ensign, his Christian soldiers marched on so courageously,
and drove with such speed before them the bloody enemies of their faith, that
they might seem to be carried by the wings of an Eagle. The ancient Laced
aemonians also before they put themselves in the field, had a certain Poem of
Tyrtaeus read unto them; but no Verses or Sonnets of Tyrtaeus, Pindarus, or
Homer, are comparable in this respect to the Songs of Sion: no Cornets, Fifes,
or Drums in the camp sound so shrill in a Christian soldiers ears, as the
silver Trumpets of the Sanctuary: no speech or oration like to a Sermon to
rowze up their spirits, and put courage and valor into their hearts, who fight
the Lords battles. None puts on so resolutely, as he who has Gods command
for his warrant, and his presence for his encouragement, and his Angels for his
guard, and a certain expectation of a crown of life after Revel. 2.10. Be
faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
death for his reward. He cannot but be such as Josuah is here willed to be,
that is strong, and of a good courage, afraid of no adverse power, dismayed
with no preparations on the contrary part, appaled at no colors, no not at the
wan and ghastly colors of death it self: For if Romans 8.31.
God be for us, who can be against us; or if they be against us, hurt us?

Have not I commanded thee? be strong therefore, etc. As God at the first, by
breathing into man the Genesis 2.7. And he breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life, and man became a living soul.
spirit of life, made him a man; so here by breathing into Josuah the spirit of
courage, he made him a man of war. Reason is the form and specificall
difference of a man; and fortitude and valor of a soldier: Be strong
therefore, and of a good courage. This courage cannot be well grounded, unless
it have Gods command, or at least warrant for the service (Have not I commanded
thee?) and his presence for our aid and assistance (The Lord thy good is with
thee.) If we have Gods command or allowance for the service we undertake, if we
fight under his Banner, and follow his Colors, we may well be strong, and of a
good courage. The Heathen Ovid. fast. l. Tu pia tela feres, sceleratas ille
sagittas, Stabit pro signis fasque piumque tuis.
Poet could say, that those who have Religion and Justice on their side, may
promise themselves happy (...). Eras. Adag.
success. A good cause makes a good courage, as wholesome meat breeds good
blood (Have not I commanded thee?) be strong, etc. A good courage in a good
quarrel cannot want Gods assistance, The Lord thy God is with thee.

Behold here then, noble Commanders and Soldiers in the Lords battles, 1. Your
commission: Have not I commanded? 2. Your duty: Be strong. 3. Your comfort,
and ground of confidence: The Lord is with you.


Have Gods word for your warrant, and his presence for your assistance, and you
cannot but be valiant and courageous; your commission will produce courage,
and your courage victory. As you are to receive commission from God, so be
strong in God, and God will be with you: first have an eye to your commission.

Have not I commanded thee? As Moses was a lively and living type of the Law,
so was Josuah of the Gospel. Moses commends Gods people to Josuah; the Law
sends us to the Gospel. Moses led the people through the Wilderness, and
discovered the Land of promise from Mount Nebo, and dyed; but Josuah brought
the people into it, and put them in possession thereof. The Law leads us in
the way, and gives us a glimpse of the celestial Canaan; but the Gospel, by
our Josuah Christ Jesus, brings us into it, and possesses us of it. That
which the Hebrew pronounce Josuah, Saint Luke and the 70. Interpreters write

Drusius, in his Commentary upon the Hebrew words of the New Testament, out of
Baal Aruch, and Elias, proves, that Josuah and Jesus are all one name. Josuah
is Jesus in the history, and Jesus is Josuah in the mystery. Josuah is typical
Jesus, and Jesus is mystical Josuah. Here then adamas insculpitur adamante,
one diamond cuts and points another. Jesus Christ instructs and encourages
Jesus Nave, the substance forms the shadow, the face draws the picture, the
truth fitteth and accommodateth the type. As those who deal in curious stuffes
that are wrought on both sides, view the flowers as well in the inside as the
out; so in the sacred context of this book, we are as well to handle and take
special notice of the inside as well as the outside: the mystical
reference, as well as the historical relation. When we read of Josuah, let
the eye of our faith be upon Jesus: when we read of his passing over Jordan,
before he gained his greatest victories, we must think of Jesus passing the
river Cedron before his passion: when we read of Josuahs Jos. 4.8.
placing 12. stones for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever, let us
think of Jesus his setting 12. precious Apoc. 21.19.

Josuahs slaying, or driving out of all the old Inhabitants of Canaan, let us
think of Jesus his destroying the Ephesians. 4.22.
old man in us, and driving out all the native, and (if I may so speak)
aboriginall sins out of our consciences: when we read of Josuahs
vanquishing 31. Kings, let us think on Jesus his victories over sin, hell,
and death, his leading captivity captive, and subduing all principalities, and
powers, and thrones, and dominions, and whatsoever lifts it self up against
his Cross: when we read of the Sun standing still in Jos. 10.12.
Josuah his battle against the Amorites, let us think of the Suns vailing
himself, and the Heavens mourning in sables at the passion of our Savior.
Lastly, when we read of Josuahs forcible entry, and taking possession of the
earthly, let us meditate upon Jesus his victorious entry into the celestial
Canaan.

Thus briefly of the person commanding, and the person commanded, both
literally and mystically. The command it self is to be a valiant Commander and
Leader of Gods people against the Amorites, Amalekites, Jebusites, and all the
several sorts of the Canaanites. For the clearing of which commission of
Josuah, two questions are to be debated: 1. Whether war in general can stand
with Religion. 2. Whether this war in particular could stand with Justice.
Both are briefly resolved in one word, I: God commands Josuah to fight;
therefore war is lawful: he appoints Josuah to command in chief in this
war against the Canaanites; this war therefore was just. Yet to remove all
scruples out of weak consciences, I crave leave to bring out before you, and
break in pieces those weak and dull weapons wherewith some fight against all
war and fighting in general, and this war in special.

First, they allege that Christ our Lord is styled the Prince of peace, that
his Spouse, the Church, is said to have nothing red about her but her lips;
which are described to be ruddy, because all her discourse is of Christ's
bloody passion.

Secondly, by the Christian law, say they, we must rather dye than kill,
rather patiently suffer our own blood to be spilt, than spill any others: if
we must render to no man evil for evil, nor rebuke for rebuke, much less
blows for blows: they that smite with a sword, shall Mat. 26 52.
perish with a sword.

Thirdly, they labor also to make the ancient Fathers on their parts, and by
name Lactantius, and Cyprian. Lactant. di^in. (...). Si qu^ (...) homin^^
^^gulaver (...) ^nta (...) ac ^^^at^^o^^ betur, n^^^^d te^^e^^ hoc domicilium
eum admittifas putant: ille autem qui infinita hominum millia truc^dave^it,
cruore campos inundaverit, slumina infecerit, non modo in Templu^ sed etiam in
coelum admittitur.
Lactantius argues thus: If any man cut the throat of one man alone, he is
taken for a nefarious malefactor and bloody murderer, and shut out of the
house of God on earth: and shall he who has been the death of many millions,
who has colored the rivers with man's blood, and made an inundation thereof in
many pitched fields, not only be admitted into the Temple, but into Heaven? And
Saint Cypr. ep l. 2. Madet orbis mutuo sanguine, and homicidium cum admittant
singuli c^^men est. virt^s vorat i^ cum public petitu^.
Cyprian pursues the same argument: The world, says he, swimmeth with man's
blood, and murder, if it be committed by single men, or one by one, is a
heinous crime; but an heroical virtue, when by public authority thousands of
men are miserably slaughtered. Can he be a good Warrior, who is taught to
seek peace and ensue it; if his enemies strike him on the right hand, to turn
the left; if he compel him to follow him one mile, to accompany him two?

With these weapons certain cowardly Heretics war against all war, and
sharpen their pens against the sword: but they are easily beat back. As Christ
is styled the Prince of peace, so God is in holy Scripture every where honored
with the title of the Lord of hosts; and the Spouse of Christ is described to
be terrible as an Cant. 6.4.
Army with banners. It follows not, that because Christian Religion
persuades patience, that therefore it abates courage: that because it
forbids private revenge, therefore public justice: because it condemns
bloody cruelty, therefore martial prowess. He which strikes with a sword,
unless lawful authority put it into his hand, shall perish with a sword; but
where God and his Vicegerent puts a sword into our hands, we must smite
with it, or we deserve to be smitten with it. We must seek peace, and ensue
it by all means; whereof one, and that a most powerful one, and sometimes the
only one, is by managing a just war. And therefore, as Saint Jerome, though
otherwise he seem partial for virginity against marriage, yet in this respect
he prefers marriage, because it begets virgins: in like manner those who
are most averse from war, must yet hold with it in this respect, because
oftentimes nothing but a good sword can make a sure and settled peace. And
therefore though in the first building of the Temple there were no noise of any
iron tool, yet in the second they built with their Nehem. 4.13.
tools in one hand and their sword in the other. And do we not read, that
the servants of God by Hebr. 11.33.
faith have subdued Kingdoms? Was it not foretold of them, that they should
bind Kings in chains, and Nobles in linkes of iron, to execute upon them the
judgment written, This honor have all his Psalm. 149.8, 9.
Saints? Does not the Kingly Prophet David by the spirit give them the word,
Arm, arm: Let the high praises of God be in their mouths, Ver. 6.
and a two edged sword in their hands? If Saint John Baptist had judged the
profession of a soldier incompatible with the calling of a Christian, when his
soldiers came unto him, and demanded of him what they should do, he would
have returned them this short answer, Quit your calling, and throw away your
armor, and undertake another profession: but on the contrary, he allowing
their calling, directs them how to demean themselves in it, saying, Do Luke
3.14.
violence to no man, nor accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.
Christian Religion is purest of all religions from all stain of blood. A
Christian Commander would more heartily wish than ever Antonius did, Utinam
possem multos ab inferis revocare; I would it were in my power to restore those
to life, whom the sword has devoured: but when the only means to save the
life-bloud about the heart, is to let out some of the corrupt blood in other
parts, he is a cruel Physician that will n^^ prick a vein. When the right
of a Crown, when the honor of the St^^e, when the Commonwealth, and every
man's private fortunes, when R^^i^^ion and our Faith lies on bleeding, not to
use the speediest means that ^^y be to drive away Usurpers, Invaders,
Rebels, Traitors, and other bloud-suckers, is bloody cruelty, and which is
worst of all, cruelty to our selves and our own bowels. To conclude, if any
upon what pretext soeve^ shall cast a blurre upon the noble and honorable
profession of a soldier, he goes about not only to take off the Garland from
the heads of all David's Worthies, but also the Crown from David himself, and
Constantine the great, and Theodosius, and many other the most glorious Princes
that ever swayed mortal Scepters. All that Christianity requires in waging
war, is comprised in that golden sentence of Saint Austin, Esto bellando
pacificus; Be thou a peacemaker even in warring, war with peace, war for
peace. War with peace, being persuaded in thy conscience of the lawfulness
of the quarrel, and bear no private malice, nor bloody mind toward thine
enemy: conquer him as fairly as thou can; and let this be the end of taking
up arms, that arms may be safely laid down on all hands And that wars
especially thus managed are lawful and warrantable even among Christians, none
but braine-sicke Anabaptists doubt: But what kind of wars are lawful, is a
point not so soon determined. Some are merely for defensive wars, Ovid. l.
1. Fastorum.
Sola gerat miles quibus arma coerceat arma.

And that such wars are lawful Nature her self teaches: Cic. pro Milunc.
Est enim haec non scripta sed nata lex, ad quam non docti sed facti, non
instituti, sed imbuti sumus.
This is a law written in the heart of all men, to repel force with force, and
beat back arms with arms; therefore defensive arms need no apology or
defense. Offensive arms are allowed by the Orator in two cases, only pro
fide and salute, when the safety, or honor of the State requires either to
right or to save our selves. Christian Religion is not so strait-laced, But
maintains all wars to be just, when they are necessary; and to judge when
they are necessary, belongs to the sovereign power of the State, in
whomsoever it resideth, either in the Prince, as in all free Monarchies; or in
the Senate and prime men, as in an Aristocratie; or the major part of the
people, as in a Democratie. It may be said that no necessity can be pretended
to invade a foreign country, and root out all the natives and inhabitants, and
settle our selves in their places, which was Josuah and Isreal's case: How then
was this war lawful?

The answer hereunto is twofold.

First, that the Israelites title was good to the Land of Canaan by the
donation of God himself, for more than four hundred years before this time.

Secondly, Josuah had a special command from God himself, to root out the
Canaanites, and to plant Gods people in their room. Therefore as he had good
warrant to undertake this war, so he had great reason to pursue and manage it
valiantly. For where God gives (...) he gives (...); where God gives
authority to do a thing lawfully, there he gives power to do it effectually.

Be strong, and of a good courage. In these words the Lord of hosts inspireth
Josuah the General of his Army with the spirit of fortitude and courage, to
perform this noble service, to settle his people in their long promised
inheritance: he exhorts them to put on a resolution to adventure upon all
dangers, to break through all difficulties, and contemn all terrors in the
accomplishment of this honorable work. Be strong, and of a good courage,
there are the positive acts; Be not afraid, nor dismayed, there are the
privative acts of Christian fortitude: strength takes away fear, courage
dismayednesse; be strong in body, and of good courage in mind; or be strong in
thy self, and courageous against thy enemies: be not surprised with any
inward fear, nor dismayed with any outward terror. For I am the Lord, and
can; I am thy God, and will be thy guard and convoy in all thy ways
whithersoever thou shall go. Fortitude and magnanimity is one of the cardinal
virtues consisting in a mediocrity, or middle temper of the mind, between
audacious temerity, and timorous cowardice. It is usually divided into two
kinds: 1. Fortitudinem in ferendo: Fortitude in bearing. 2. Fortitudinem in
feriendo: Fortitude in attempting, or assailing.


The former is the glory of the Martyrs, the later the crown of Christian
soldiers; both are requisite to make up the perfect entire virtue of Christian
fortitude, which must have as well a back of patience to endure all hardness,
as an edge of valor or courage, to set upon all difficulties, and go through
all dangers, not sticking at death it self, (...), the king of all fears.
This virtue is called in Greek, (...), from (...), from a word signifying a
man, as manhood in our Language, to intimate, that it is the most proper virtue
of a man; and that he is not a man, who is not manly and courageous in Gods
cause, and his Countries. Degeneres animos timor arguit, Fearfulness is an
argument of a base mind, but valor is the proper ornament of a generous
spirit; which has been always held in that esteem in the world, that all
trophies, triumphs, obeliskes, coats of arms, and other ensigns of honor
have been appropriated to this virtue, and that deservedly. For all other Cic.
pro Murena. Omnes arts latent sub tutela rei bellicae.
arts and professions whatsoever, lie under the safe protection of it. In which
regard Fulvius removed the images of the nine Muses out of a Chapel in
Ambracion, and placed them in Hercules Temple at Rome; to show that as arms
need the commendation of arts, so all arts stand in need of the defense of
arms. To this virtue we owe our liberty, our honor, our wealth, our state:
upon which premises the Orator infers this conclusion; Cic. pro Muren.
Cedat stylus gladio, umbra soli, sitque illa virtus in civitate prima, per quam
fit ipsa civitas omnium princeps.
Let therefore the pen give place to the sword, arts to arms, the shade to the
sun, and let that virtue have the preheminency in the State, by which the
State it self gets the precedence of all other; let that rule in the city,
by which the city has obtained the rule of the whole world. The great
Philosopher Aristotle seems to subscribe to this conclusion: for in
martialling moral virtues in their order, he gives magnanimity the first
place: and he yields this reason for it; the more difficult and dreadful
the subject, the more excellent the virtue which regulates the affection about
it: now death is the chief of all fears, magnanimity therefore which
conquereth this fear is the Prince of all virtues. As the strength of a blade
is tried by the hardness of the matter which it cutteth, be it wood, stone,
or metal: so the excellency of virtue is seen in the difficulty of the object
about which it is conversant; and what so difficult as willingly to hazard our
life, and contemn death? If reason can work this in a moral man, shall not
religion much more in a Christian? If fame, and a garland of flowers, and a
small donative can produce noble thoughts and resolutions in heathen, shall not
immortal glory, and an incorruptible garland, and hope of an immarcessible
crown breed more generous resolutions in those who have given their names to
the Lord of Hosts, to fight his battles? especially considering that valor and
courage, as it is more honorable, so it is safer than base fear. For it
strikes a terror in the hearts of the enemies, and often times winnes a
victory without striking a blow. And as our courage makes the enemies
fearful, so our timorousness makes them valorous; our trembling at danger
brings more danger upon us, by making us unable to resist. For this cowardly
affection works not only upon the soul, but upon the body also; and as it
dejecteth and dis-armeth the one, so it dis-ableth and weakeneth the other. But
the strongest motive to fortitude, and most effectual incentive to courage,
and surest ground of confidence, is that which now follows in the last place.

The Lord thy God is with thee whither soever thou go. The Lord, whose
command is universal; God, whose power is invincible; The Lord thy God, whose
mercies are incomprehensible, is with thee whither soever thou go. If the
Lord thy God be with thee, his wisdom is with thee to direct thee, his power
to protect thee, his strength to support thee, his goodness to maintain thee,
his bounty to reward thee, his word to encourage thee, and, if thou dye under
his banner, his Angels presently to carry thee into heaven. Where the
Israelites lamentably deplore their ill success in war, they attribute it to
Gods absence, Psalm. 44 9. and 60.10.
Thou go not forth, say they, with our armies. And to the end that they
might be more assured of Gods presence with them in their battles, they carried
the Ark of God with them, and were wont to ask counsel of him before hand,
touching the success of their war; and in ancienter times the Priests gave
answer from God by the Ephod: but in the latter, if we may believe Joseph.
antiq. Judaic.
Josephus, they ghessed at the event by the glaring or duskinesse of the
Diamond on the Priests breast plate. For if it shined brightly and clearly, it
foreshewed certain victory; but if it changed the color, or lost any thing of
the luster, it portended ill success. The Lacedaemonians being overtaken by
the Persian horse, and overwhelmed with great flights of arrows, did
notwithstanding quietly sit still, without making any resistance at all, or
defense, till the sacrifices for victory were happily ended; yea though many
were sore hurt, and some slain out right before any good sign appeared in the
entrails: but as soon as their General Pausanias had found good tokens of
victory, and persuaded his soldiers of the divine approbation of their war,
they arose, and with excellent courage first received the charge of the
Barbarians, and after charged them afresh, and slew Mardonius the Persian
General, and many thousands of the rest, and got the day. If the conjecturall
hope of the aid and assistance of a fained deity put such courage and
resolution into the Lacedaemonians, shall not faith in the true God, and
confidence in his help, breed better blood, and infuse nobler spirits into
the hearts of Gods warriors, and Christian soldiers? God can save his, and
overcome the enemy, as well with small forces as with great; but all the forces
in the world without him have no force at all. Therefore though Captains have
many employments, yet they must look especially to hoc unum necessarium, this
one thing most needful, That they have God on their side, that they make him
sure for them. You will say, I know, How may this be done? How may he be
wrought and made thorough for us? He shows at the 7. and 8. verses. Observe
to do according to all the Law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn
not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou may prosper
whithersoever thou go. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy
mouth, but thou shall meditate therein day and night, that thou may observe
to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shall make thy
way prosperous: and then thou shall have good success.

First, the Lords Josuah's must look strictly to their life and conversation,
so much the rather by how much in battle they are nearer death; which points
to them in every sword and spear, and gives them a summons at the report of
every Cannon, and discharging of every Piece.

Secondly, they must look to their companies and troops, and see that there
be never an Achan among them, never a sacrilegious, profane, or abominable
person, whose horrible crimes, if they be not discovered and punished, may
prove the loss of many a battle, and the ruin of a whole army. The
Barbarians hands, says Saint Barbari nostris vitiis fortes sunt.
Jerome, are made strong against us by our grievous transgressions; our
infirmities are our enemies greatest strength, our distractions their security,
our crying sins their thundering ordnance. Sal. l. 4. de provid.
Salvianus acknowledges that it was just with God to strengthen the armies of
the Goths and Vandals, though they were heretics, against the right
believing Romans, because those barbarous nations observed most strict
discipline, and lived more chastely and temperately than the Roman soldiers.

Lastly, when you put on your corporal armor, forget not to put on the
spiritual, laid out for you by the Apostle, and gilt by his divine eloquence;
I mean, Ephesians. 6.14, 15, 16, 17.
The breast plate of righteousness, the shoes of preparation, the shield of
faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit. Learn of that
fortunate Commander of the Goths, who, like lightning, in a moment appeared
from one part of the earth to the other, and nothing was able to withstand him.
This Emperor never put himself into the field to fight with his enemy, before
at home he had made his peace with God. Salvianus, who lived at the same time,
and accurately observed his demeanor, attributes his miraculous victories to
nothing more than to his extraordinary and admirable devotion. Sal. de prove. l.
7. Ipse rex hostium usque ad diem pugnae, stratus cilicio preces fundit, ante
bellum in oratione jacuit, ad bellum de oratione surrexit.
The King that warreth against us, to the very day in which he draws out his
forces to fight, lies on the ground at his devotion in sackcloth and ashes;
before he goes into the battle he is at his prayer in private, and never
rises but from his knees to fight. Wrestle you in like manner with God, that
you may be Isreal's; keep his Law as strictly as your Martial discipline, and
I will be bold to give you now at your parting the benediction of the Psalmist:
Psalm. 45.3, 4.
Gird your swords upon your thighs, O ye mighty, with glory, ride on with
honor, because of truth, meekness, and righteousness, and your right hand
shall teach you terrible things; your arrows shall be sharp in the heart of
the Kings enemies, whereby the people shall fall under you. Has not the Lord
by his Vicegerent commanded you to help and assist your brethren? Be strong
therefore, and of a good courage, and the Lord God shall be with you
whithersoever you go. To whom, etc.

THE CROWN OF HUMILITY. A Sermon preached in VVooll-Church, April 10. 1624.
THE NINETEENTH SERMON.
MATTHEW. 5.3. Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the Kingdom of
Heaven.


THey who desire to abide in the Tabernacle of the Almighty, and rest upon his
holy Psalm. 15.1.
Hill, had need to get by heart, and con without book by continual practice
this Sermon of Christ upon the Mount: which has more ravishing strains of
Eloquence, more divine a phorismes of Wisdom, more powerful motives to
Holiness, more certain directions to Happiness treasured up in it, than are
found in all the parenetiques of Orators, all the diatribes of Philosophers,
all the apophthegmes of Sages, all the emblemes of Poets, all the
hieroglyphics of Egyptian Priests, all the tables of Laws, all the pandects
of Constitutions, all the digests of Imperial Sanctions, all the bodies and
systemes of Canons, all acts of Parliament, all rules of Perfection ever
published to the worlds view. I dare confidently affirm, that which all the
ancient and later Commentatours upon it will make good, that this one Sermon in
Monte surmounts them all. Ubi desinit Philosophus, ibi incipit Medicus; Where
the Philosophers left and could go no further, the Physician of our soul goes
on, at the health and eternal salvation of our immortal spirit: where they
made an end of their discourses, which yet came far short of their mark,
there he begins, at blessedness it self. And doubtless, if there be any
happiness in knowledge, it is in the knowledge of happiness; which the proper
owner thereof in himself, and gracious doner to his creatures capable thereof,
bestows here as a dowry, and shareth between eight divine virtues. 1.
Humility: poor in spirit. 2. Repentance: mourning for sin. 3. Compassion:
ever meek. 4. Devotion: hungring and thirsting for righteousness. 5. Piety:
always merciful. 6. Sincerity: pure in heart. 7. Brotherly love: making
peace. 8. Patience: enduring all for righteousness sake:


There are no strains in Music so delightful, as those in which discords
are artificially bound in with concords; nor dishes so dainty, as those in
which sweet things, and tart or sour are seasonably mingled: nor pictures so
beautiful, as those in which bright colors with dark shadows are curiously
tempered: nor sentences so rhetorical, as those in which contraries are fitly
opposed, and set one against the other. Such are almost all the strains of
this sweet Lesson pricked by our Savior, such are all the dishes placed in
this heavenly Banquet, such are the pictures set in this Gallery, such are the
sentences skilfully contrived into the Proeme of this Sermon; wherein blessing
is opposed to cursing, laughing to weeping, reward to punishments, satisfaction
to hungring and thirsting, gain to losses, glory to shame, and (in my Text)
heavenly riches to earthly poverty. 1. Blessed poverty, because to be enriched.
2. Blessed mourning, because to be comforted. 3. Blessed hungring, because to
be satisfied. 4. Blessed enduring punishment, because to be rewarded.


Blessed are the poor, etc. In these words our blessed Savior, the hope of
our blessedness here, and blessedness of our hope hereafter, teaches us, 1.
Whom we are to call blessed. 2. Why.


1. Whom, the humble in heart, here termed poor in spirit.

2. Why, because their lowliness of mind entituleth them to the highest top of
honor, glory, and happiness, a Kingdom, and that in Heaven. Blessed, not in
fruition, but in hope, are the poor, not simply in estate, but in spirit: and
these are also blessed, not for any thing they have on earth, but for that they
shall have in heaven, an incorruptible Crown of glory.

1. There are some to be held for blessed even in this life.

2. These blessed are the poor.

3. These poor are poor in spirit.

Or if you like better of a Logical division, than a Theological partition,
observe in this speech of our Savior, 1. An affirmation, Blessed are the
poor. 2. A confirmation, For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.


The affirmation is strange, and may be called a divine Paradoxe: for the world
accounts blessedness to consist in wealth and abundance; not in poverty. A
good man, in the language of the City, is a wealthy man. Poverty above all
things is despised: Juv sat. 3.
Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se,
Quam quod ridiculos homines facit.
And of all poor men we have the meanest opinion of those that are poor in
spirit, we account not them worth the earth they tread upon; yet for these
Christ plats the Garland of blessedness. Because the affirmation is strange,
the confirmation ought to be strong; and so indeed it is: For, says he,
theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Whether we take the Kingdom of Heaven for
the Kingdom of grace, or the Kingdom of glory, they have best right to both.
For the Kingdom of grace is in them, according to the words of our Savior,
Luke 17.21.
The Kingdom of God is with you: and they shall be in the Kingdom of glory
when they enter into their Masters joy; and therefore they are doubly happy: 1.
Re. 2. Spe.


1. Re, in the present possession of the Kingdom of grace: and

2. Spe, in the certain expectation of the Kingdom of glory.

O how is the world out in her account! She esteems them the only miserable,
who indeed are the only happy: she deemeth them the offscouring of all
things, who shall shine as stars in the Firmament: she accounts them
beggars and forlorn men, who are Apoc. 1.6. And has made us Kings and Priests
unto God.
Kings to God, and so assured of a celestial Crown, that Christ says not
theirs shall be, but theirs is the kingdom of Heaven, as if they now ware it.
When one of Apelles his scholars had drawn Helena in costly and gorgeous
apparel, hung all over with orient pearl, and resplendent stones; O young
man, says he, because thou could not paint Helena fair, her natural
feature being above thy art, thou have drawn her rich: in like manner may we
say truly, that because the Heathen Philosophers (whose several opinions
amount unto the number of some hundreds, as Saint Austin relates in his books
of the City of God, and strikes a dash of his pen through them all) could not
describe their summum bonum, or chief happiness beautiful; because they
wanted the eye of faith to descry the beauty of the 1 Pet. 3.4.
hidden man of the heart, they like the young man thought to make amends by
painting her rich, abounding with all outward comforts and contentments,
houses, possessions, treasures, attendants, pleasures, honors: but our blessed
Savior contrariwise, because he could not set her forth rich in estate here
(for Mat. 8.20. The son of man has not where to ^^y his head.
he had not himself to lay his head upon) he describes her most fair and
beautiful, like Psalm. 45.13.
Solomon's Queen, all glorious within. Has not God chosen the Jam. 2.5.
poor of this world rich in faith, to be heirs of his Kingdom? Yes
certainly: for Christ not only affirms them to be blessed, saying, Blessed
are the poor; but also confirms it with a most forcible reason, For theirs is
the Kingdom of Heaven. Upon which Scripture all my observations for the
present shall level at three points: 1. Blessedness. 2. Poverty in spirit. 3.
Kingdom of Heaven.


First I will demonstrate, that the Saints of God enjoy a kind of blessedness
in this life. Secondly, that this blessedness consists especially in their
right to a crown in heaven. Thirdly, that this right is in the poor in spirit.

Blessed are. They who observe the changings and turnings of this mortal life,
and in them consider how wretched man, like a Tennis-ball, is beat from wall to
wall, and as it were racketted from one trouble to another, from one care to
another, from one exigent to another, may easily guess at the reason why the
ancient Sages termed him Melancthon chron.
ludum deorum, the gods game or sport. For as Tiberus Constantinus in the year
of our Lord 577. John Don psed. Mart
commanding a golden cross set in Marble to be dug up, that it might not be
trod upon, found under it a second, and under the second a third, and under the
third a fourth; so the dearest servants of God in this world digging for the
hidden treasure of the Gospel, find cross under cross, and loss upon loss,
and sorrows after sorrows. Look how the waves in the sea ride one upon the
neck of the other, and like as Jobs messengers trod one upon the heels of
another; so miseries, and calamities, and vexations in the course of this life
follow close one upon the other. The vanity of youth presses upon the folly of
childhood, and the ambition of ripe years immediately succeeds the folly of
youth, and infirmities of old age seize on the ambition of perfect age, and the
terrors of death make haste after all. We run in the race of our life as it
were in a ring of misery, from inward evils to outward, and from outward to
inward, from diseases of body to maladies of mind, and from those to these;
from fears to cares, and from cares to fears, from temporal losses to
spiritual, and from spiritual back again to temporal, which are so many
and so grievous, that whosoever is sensible of them, cannot but acknowledge
this present life to be miserable: and if he be not sensible of them, he is
to be accounted so much the more miserable, because he has lost common sense,
as Saint Aug. de civit. Dei, l. 19. c. 7. Haec mala tam magna, tam horrenda,
tam saeva quisquis cum dolor considerat miseriam necesse est fateatur,
quisquis autem considerat, vel patitur ca sine animi dolote, multo utique
miserius, ideo se putat beatum, quia humanum perdidit sensum.
Austin nimbly wieldeth this two-edged sword against the Heathen Philosophers
that doted upon worldly happiness. Polycrates, who would not seal the truth
concerning the vanity and uncertainty of worldly happiness with his ring,
which he purposely threw in the sea, that he might lose it, but regained it
again out of the mouth of a fish sold in the Market, and brought into his
Kitchen: yet afterward he signed it with his blood, when the date of his
happy fortunes were out, and the cross fell in the end to be his lot. And
Croesus, who derided Solon, preaching to him this doctrine, as he sat upon
his throne at Sardis, afterward taken prisoner by Cyrus, and condemned to the
fire, proclaimed it upon the pile now ready to be kindled, crying out upon
Solon, Herod. Clio.
O Solon, Solon, I find thy words to be Oracles, and thy Paradox to be an
Axiom: -- dicique beatus

that no man ought to be entered in the Calendar of the Blessed, before we see
what end he makes, whether the glorious light of his temporal prosperity go
not out in an obscure and stinking snuff of a miserable and infamous death.
Reason easily persuades, but Religion compels our assent to this truth. For
Christianity is a Tertul^n a olog. Hoc quod Christiani sumus fidei and speires

with Christ in God: when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we
also appear with him in glory. By hope we are saved, but hope that is seen is
not hope; for what a man sees, why should he hope for it? If this hope were
confined to this life, then were the best Christians of all men the most 1 Cor.

miserable. How then does our Savior here crown eight sorts of Christians with
a title of Blessedness, and those who make least show of it (viz.) the poor in
spirit, mourners, hungry, thirsty, persecuted, reviled, cursed persons?

To clear the meaning of our Savior, it will be requisite briefly to
declare, first, how man is capable of blessedness at all: secondly, how far
in this life, truly termed by St. Austin the region of death.

Blessedness is a sovereign attribute of God, and as Nyss hom de ^^at.
Nyssen teaches, primarily, and absolutely, and eternally belongs to him
only. Creatures are blessed but in part, derivatively, and at the most from
the term of their creation. Beauty first shines in the living face and
countenance; that which is resembled in the image or picture, is but a
secondary, or relative beauty: in like manner, says he, the primary
blessedness is in God, or to speak more properly, is God himself; the
blessedness which is in man made after Gods image, is but a secondary
blessedness. For as the image is, such is his beauty and blessedness; but the
image of God in man since his fall is much soiled and defaced, and
consequently, his blessedness is very imperfect and obscure. Yet they that
rub off the dust of earthly cares, and dirt of sin, and by spiritual
exercises brighten the graces of God in their soul, as they are truly, though
not perfectly beautiful within; so they may be truly, though not absolutely
styled blessed even in this life.

1. First, because they are assured of Gods love, and they see his countenance
shine upon them, which puts more Psalm 4.7.
gladness into their heart, than is or can be in the heart of them whose corn
and wine is increased. For if it be deservedly accounted the greatest
happiness of a subject to be in continual grace with his Prince, what is it
to be a Favorite of the King of kings?

2. Secondly, because they have an 1 Pet. 1.4.
inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in
the heavens for them. A great heir, though he may sometimes pinch for
maintenance, and be driven to hard exigents; yet he still solaceth himself
with this hope, it will be better with me, and I shall one day come to my
lands: and such comfort have all Gods Saints in their greatest perplexities and
extremities.

3. Thirdly, because they enjoy the peace of a good conscience, which Solomon
calls a continual feast. And Saint Paul a cause of 2 Cor. 1.12. For our
rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience. Romans 8.28.
triumph and joy.

4. Fourthly, because all things work together for their good, and tend to
their eternal happiness. The joys of the wicked are grievous, their
pleasures are pain unto them: but on the contrary, the sorrows of the
righteous are joyous, and the pains which they endure for Christ are pleasures
unto them. The gains of the worldly are indeed losses unto them, because they
help on their damnation; whereas the losses of the godly are gain and
advantage unto them, because they further their salvation.

5. Fifthly, because they enjoy God (wherein consists the happiness of a
man) in some measure and degree even in this life. For it cannot be denied, but
that devout Christians, even whilst the soul resides in the body, have a
comfortable fruition of the Deity (whose favor is better than life) by faith
in the heart, by knowledge in the understanding, by charity in the will, by
desire in the affections, by sight in the creatures, by hearing in the Word, by
taste in the Sacraments, by feeling in the inward motions and operations of
Gods Spirit, which fill them with exceeding and unspeakable joy and comfort.

Saint Apoc. 21.
John setting forth the blessedness of the triumphant Church, and depainting
the joys of Heaven in golden colors, describes a City situate in Heaven,
whose temple is God, and light the Lamb, and walls Salvation, and courts
praise, and streets gold, and foundations gemmes, and gates pearls, twelve in
number, in a relation to the Lambs twelve Apostles. Answerable to the gates in
price, though not in number, are the steps up to them, which our Savior (who
is the way) directs us unto: they are eight in number, made of so many whole
pearls, that is, divine Virtues.

1. The first step is humility, poor in spirit, upon which when we stand, we
may easily get upon the next, godly sorrow, mourning for sin: none so apt to
mourn for their sins, and humble themselves under the mighty hand of God in
sackcloth and ashes, as the poor in spirit.

2. When we are upon this step, we readily get up upon the next, which is
tender compassion and meekness: none so compassionate and meek toward
others, when they slip into the mire of sin, as those who continually bewail
their foul falls, and wash their defiled souls with their tears.

3. When we are upon this third step, we may soon get up the fourth, which is
hungering and thirsting for righteousness: for those who are most sensible of
their own wants, and continually bewail their corruptions, and are
compassionately affected toward others when they are overtaken with any
temptation, must needs hunger and thirst for righteousness both in themselves
and others.

4. When we are upon this fourth step, we may soon climb up to the other
three; Mercy the fifth, Purity the sixth, and Peace the seventh: for they who
eagerly pursue righteousness, shall certainly meet with these three her
companions.

Lastly, they who have attained unto righteousness, and are enamoured with her
three companions, Mercy, Purity, and Peace, will suffer any thing for their
sake, and so ascend up the highest step of Christian perfection, which is
constant patience, and zealous striving for the truth, even unto blood, which
is not only saved, but cleansed also by being spilt for Christ's sake. The
lowest greece or staire, and the first step to Heaven is poverty in spirit,
that is, as the Fathers generally interpret, Humility: which is the
ground-colour of the souls beautiful images the graces of the spirit. The
ground-colours are dark and obscure, yet except they be first laid, the wool
or stuff will not receive, much less retain the brighter and more
beautiful. Such is lowliness of mind, of no great luster and appearance in
itself; yet without it no grace or virtue will long keep color, and its
beauty: and therefore Christ first lays it, saying, Blessed are the

Poor in spirit. These poor in spirit are not to be understood poor in
spiritual graces, such cannot come near the price of the Kingdom of Heaven:
and therefore the spirit advises them under the type of the Church of Apoc.
3.18.
Laodicea, to buy of him gold tried in the fire, that they may be rich, etc.
nor are they necessarily poor in state, much less such as are poor in state
only: for bare poverty, yea though it be voluntary, is but a weak plea, and
gives a man but a poor title to a Kingdom in Heaven. We hear indeed in the
Gospel of Lazarus the Luke 16.22.
Beggar in Heaven, but we find him there in the bosom of rich Abraham, to
teach us, as Saint Austine notes, that neither the poverty of the one brought
him thither, nor the wealth of the other kept him from thence. John 14.2.
In my Fathers house, says our Savior, there are many mansions; some for the
rich, some for the poor, some for noble, some for ignoble, some for Agapet. ad
Justin. (...).
kings, some for beggars: and it is hard to say, whethers crown in Heaven
shall be more massy, and be set with more orient jewels, the rich man's, who
is also rich in God, or the poor man's, who is poor for God: the wealthy, who
has given much to Christ, or the needy, who has lost all for his sake: the
noble and honorable man, who by his birth and place has innobled the
Christian faith, or the ignoble, who has preferred the ignominy of Christ's
cross to all the honors of this world: the King, who lays down his scepter
at the foot of Christ's cross, or the Beggar, who takes up his cross, and
readily follows Christ. It is true which Saint Cypr. de laps. Multos
patrimonia pondere suo depresserunt in ter^am.
Cyprian charge many of the rich in his time with, that their great
patrimonies, and large revenues of their lands, with the weight thereof pressed
them down to the earth, nay, some to hell. But the fault was in their mind,
not in their means; in their desires, not in their fortunes or estates. For as
when a man takes a heavy Trunk full of plate or money upon his shoulders, it
crooketh his back, and boweth him down toward the earth; but if the same weight
be put under his feet, it lifts him above ground: in like manner if we put our
wealth and riches above us, preferring them to our salvation, they will press
us down to the ground, if not to hell with their weight; but if we put them
under our feet, and tread upon them as slaves to us, and quite contemn them in
respect of heavenly treasure, they will raise us up toward heaven. As they did
Job, who made so many friends of unrighteous Mammon, that every eye that saw
him blessed him. As they did Mary Magdalen, whose name is and shall be like an
ointment powered out to the end of the world, because she brake an Alabaster
box of most costly Matthew. 26.12, 13. Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached
in the whole world, there shall also this that this woman has done be told,
for a memorial of her.
ointment upon the head of our Savior. As they did Cornelius, whose
almsdeeds were a forcible means to carry up his prayers into Heaven, Acts
10.31. Thy prayer is heard, and thine almsdeeds are had in remembrance. As
they did Dorcas, whom the clothes which she made for the widows and poor
orphants kept warm in her death bed ( The Acts 9.39.
widows stood by her weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas
made whilst she was with them) and were motives to Saint Peter by miracle to
restore her to life. As they did Constantine the great, who made his crown the
basis of Christ's cross. As they did Ludovicus, who by continual largess
turned all his state into obligations. The meaning then is not, that none are
blessed but poor: for 1 Timothy 4.8. Godliness is profitable unto all things,
etc.
Godliness has the promises of this life, and the life to come. But to make
up the harmony of the Evangelicall doctrine in this place, we must take one
note from the words as they are related by Saint Luke, and another from the
words, as they are recorded by Saint Matthew in my Text. The note from Saint
Luke is, That the worlds miserable man is for the most part Christ's blessed
man. Christ's words in Saint Luke are these; Luke 6.20, 21, 24, 25.
Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the Kingdom of God. Blessed are ye that
hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye
shall laugh. But woe unto you that are rich: for you have received your
consolation. Woe be unto you that are full: for you shall hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now: for you shall mourn and weep. Vicibus res disposita est,
Happiness goes by turns. Dives shall be Lazarus hereafter, and Lazarus on
earth shall be Dives in Heaven: those who laugh here, shall weep there; and
those who weep here, shall laugh there: those who feast continually, and riot
in pleasures in this world, shall fast in the other; and those who fast upon
earth, shall feast with the Lamb in Heaven.

But the note which we are to take from Saint Matthew is, That affliction and
penury, unless it be sanctified to us by God, no way makes us happy: Blessed
are the poor, not simply, but with an addition, in spirit. The poor are
blessed, if poor in spirit, that is, humble. Blessed are they that mourn, if
their mourning be a godly mourning, either out of sense of their own sin, or
compassion of their brethrens miseries. For godly 2 Cor. 7.10.
sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of; but the sorrow
of the world works death. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst, if it be
for righteousness; for there are that hunger for the fleshpots of Egypt, and
there are that thirst after blood, or after Prove. 9.17. Stolen waters are
sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant, but he knows not that the dead
are there, and that her guests are in the depth of hell.
stolen waters, which are sweet in the mouth, but poison in the belly, and
rottenness in the bones. And neither of these are blessed. All that are in
want are not Christ's poor, neither are all that wear blackes his mourners.
Saint Luke says in effect, not many rich are blessed: Saint Matthew adds,
nor all poor, but the poor in spirit only, that is, such as are of an humble
spirit, or a Prove. 16.19. Esaias 57 15. I dwell in the high and holy place, with
him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit.
contrite spirit. Those Beza in Mat. 5. Qui sive paupertate, sive aliis
calamitatibus domiti, sive ultro peccatorum suorum sensu tacti, and ab omni
superbia remoti, sese Deo subjiciunt.
who by any affliction outward or inward are so thoroughly tamed and subdued,
that they humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, wholly relying upon
his providence for their estate, and upon his mercy for their salvation. None
is poor in spirit, says Calvin harm. Nemo spiritu pauper est, nisi qui in
nihilum apud se redactus in Dei misericordia recumbit, namque desperatione
fracti, cum adversus Deum fremunt, elato superboque spiritu esse oportet.
Calvin, but he who being brought to nothing in himself, casts himself
wholly upon Gods mercy. For he who grows into desperate fits, and murmureth
against the most High, must needs be of an impatient and proud spirit. Crosses
work not alike upon all: some are bettered by them, some are made worse; some
are bowed down by them, others rise up against them. As under the same flaile
the stubble is bruised, and the corn purged; and in the same Aug. l. 1. de
Civ. Dei. Sub codem igneaurum rutilat, palea fumat.
fire gold shines, and chafe smoaketh: so the same affliction which tries
the faith of the godly like gold, and makes it more precious, consumes the
temporary belief of hypocrites like dross. We read in the Apocalypse, that
after the fifth Angel powered out his vial upon the seat of the Beast, that his
kingdom was full of darkness: and they Rev. 16.10.
gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of Heaven, because of
their pains, and sores, and repented not of their deeds: these turned
medicines into poisons, whereas on the contrary the true servants of God make
medicines even of poisons; like silver Bells, they ring sweetest when they are
struck hardest. Of those who are smitten by the hand of God, some like solid
bones are hardened by his stroke, some like tender flesh are softened thereby,
some turn to him that strikes them, others fly away from him: the former are
blessed, not the latter; theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, not theses. Here
some may cast in a scruple, Why should Christ preach poverty in spirit to his
Disciples, who had nothing to be proud of, being poor, illiterate, despicable
men? Saint Chrysostom answers:

First, that the greater part of the multitude, to whom Christ directed his
speech, were not Disciples, but men of another condition, who bare themselves
upon their wealth, or place of authority; and in that regard much needed a
Lecture of Humility to be read unto them.

Secondly, he adds, that this admonition was very seasonable, even to his
Disciples, lest they should be puffed up with their miraculous gifts of
casting out Devils, and healing all manner of diseases.

Thirdly, it may be thought also, that our Savior used this Preface to his
Sermon, not so much to instruct his Disciples, as to vindicate them and his
doctrine from scorn and dis-esteeme. For if you draw out at length this rich
piece of Arras, you shall find in it the heads and lineaments of this
exhortation, or the like. O ye people of Israel, and seed of Abraham, you
look for a glorious and majesticall Messiah to restore the kingdom unto
Israel, and to make you all rich and mighty men upon earth: and therefore you
despise me and my Disciples in regard of our poverty and mean estate. But you
err, not knowing the Scriptures, not the true characters of the Messiah, whose
Kingdom is not of this world, neither is he here to rule this Nation in pomp
and state; but to be rejected of it, and to be slain in it, and crucified,
and so to enter into his glory. And as for my Disciples and Followers, despise
not them though they be poor, and in mournful habit, and forlorn and
persecuted men: for I tell you, Blessed are these poor, For theirs is the
Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are these mourners: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are these persecuted men for my sake: for great is their reward in
Heaven. As I come now in humility, so I preach poverty in spirit. As I come in
the form of a servant, so I preach obedience. As I come to suffer, so I preach
patience. The Disciple is not greater than his Master, nor the servant than his
lord.

And so I have done with the assertion or affirmation, Blessed are the poor in
spirit; and am now to examine the reason or confirmation.

For theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. What Synesius spoke concerning his
preferment to his disadvantage, Citat. a Casaub. tract. de liberate ecclesiast.
(...). Now, says he, ascend downward: for before thou did descend upward
(his meaning was, that now he gained in honor, but lost in profit; but before
lost in honor, and gained in wealth) may fitly be applied to all mankind, who
fell by rising in our own conceits, and Aug. confess. l. 4. c. 12. Descendite
ut ascendatis ad Deum, c^cidistis enim ascendendo contra eum.
can no otherwise rise again, but by falling in our selves. We ascended
downward in Adam, when we would be like unto God in knowledge; but we descend
upward when we strive to be like the son of man, and learn of Christ to be
meek and lowly in heart. The first precipice or down fall to Hell both in
Angel and Man was by pride: therefore humility must needs be the first step to
Heaven. For the rule holds both in the physic of soul and body, Contraria
curantur contrariis. As the disease is contrary to health, so the remedy is
always contrary to the disease. He that means to build high, must lay his
foundation low: he that sets any choice plant, diggeth the earth deep to
put in the root. All those precious and resplendent stones reckoned up in the
Apocalypse, were placed in the Apoc. 21.19. And the foundation of the wall of
the Ci y was ga^nshed with all manner of precious stones.
foundation of the heavenly City, to teach us, that all Christian virtues are
grounded in humility. If a vessel be full, it will receive no more liquor, be
it never so sovereign and precious. The proud and high minded man is full of
his own gifts and perfections; and therefore lets not into his soul the
wholesome dew of Gods grace. What is the reason so few great, and mighty, and
noble, and wise, and learned enter into Christ's school, or very late? because
the gate is low, and they will not stoop. Holy Austin Aug. confess. l. 9. c. 4.
Dulce sit mihi confiteri quemadmodum me complanaveris humiliatis montibus
cogitationum mearum. Tumor meus non capiebat illius modum.
confesses with tears, that his swelling greatness or tumor of pride would
not suffer him for a long time to enter in at the Mat. 7.13, 14. Enter in at
the strait gate, because strait is the gate that leads unto life.
narrow gate that leads unto life. In whose tears many of our noble Sparks,
or lusty Gallants, and high Spirits may read the cause why they are so usually
poor, and naked, and blind in the inward man, and though oft-times nearest to
the Court of Princes, yet are furthest off from the Kingdom of God. They will
not confess their wants, either because they suppose they have none, or they
cannot endure the shame of acknowledging them: they will not beg, because
they are rich in their own conceits: they will not subject their reason to
faith, because they value their reason above faith: but those that are poor in
spirit are ever begging and asking at Gods hands; and therefore always on the
taking hand. The soul that feels her self empty, hungereth and thirsts
for righteousness; and therefore is satisfied. The modest man has no opinion
of his own wit or wisdom: and therefore willingly brings every thought
into captivity, and every affection to the obedience of the Gospel. The lowly
in heart esteems more vilely of himself than the world can: and therefore
he cheerfully takes up his cross and follows Christ.

Thus have I cleared the title of the poor in spirit to the Kingdom of
Heaven: which is so sure and unquestionable, that our Savior says not, Theirs
shall be in the future; but in the present tense, Theirs is the Kingdom of
Heaven. And likewise, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come unto
me, for of such Matthew. 19.14.
is the Kingdom of Heaven. As we say of such an one that has the advowson of
a Benefice, or reversion of an Office under seal: or of an heir to a wealthy
father, such a Lordship, or such a Manor, or such an Office, or such a
Benefice is his, either because he is as sure thereof as if he were possessed
of it; or because he has actually jus ad rem, though not in re, a right to it,
though not in it: so in regard of the poor in spirit their undoubted right to,
and their present interest in some of the privileges and profits of their
heavenly Fathers Kingdom, that Kingdom is said here to be theirs already.
When Cyneas the Ambassador of Pyrrhus, after his return from Rome, was asked
by his Master what he thought of the City and State, he answered, that it
seemed to him Respublica Regum, A State of none but great Statesmen, and a
Commonwealth of Kings. Put the same question to Saint John concerning
Jerusalem that descended from God, he will answer you in like manner, Videri
rempublicam Regum, that it is no other than a Parliament of Emperors, or a
Commonwealth of Kings. For in the Kingdom of grace upon earth all Kings are
subjects; but in the Kingdom of glory in Heaven all subjects are Kings. Every
humble and faithful soul is coheire with Christ, and has a robe of honor,
and a scepter of power, and a throne of majesty, and a crown of glory. If you
peruse the records and evidences of Heaven exemplified in holy Scripture, you
shall find no estates there but inheritances, no inheritances but kingdoms,
no houses but palaces, no meals but feasts, no noise but music, no rods but
scepters, no garments but robes, no seats but thrones, no head ornaments but
crowns: these inheritances, these palaces, these feasts, these songs, these
scepters, these thrones, these robes, these crowns God bring us unto, and
possess us with through poverty in spirit, in the right and title purchased
for us by our elder brother Christ Jesus. To whom, etc.

THE COGNIZANCE OF A CHRISTIAN: OR CHRIST HIS NEW COMMANDMENT. A Sermon
preached in VVooll-Church. THE TWENTIETH SERMON.
JOH. 13.34. A new commandment give I unto you, That ye love one another, as I
have loved you, that ye also love one another.


Right Worshipful, etc.
ALL that by a Christian vocation are severed from the world, and cut as it
were out of the common rock of mankind, and by faith rely upon Christ, are

corner stone rising to a spiritual building, reaching from the earth to
heaven. The line by which they are built is the Word of God, and the cement
wherewith they are held fast together is Christian charity, the soder of minds,
the couple of dispositions, the glue of affections, and the bond of all
perfection; which to fasten the more strongly, among all that gave their name
to Christ, the Primitive Church in the days of the Apostles added a double
tie: 1. Sacred. 2. Civil.


The sacred was the frequent receiving of the Lords Supper: the civil was the
celebrating their Agapae's, or keeping their love feasts. Which though they
were in after ages taken away, by reason of manifold abuses and disorders
committed in them, even in the place of holy assemblies: yet it were to be
wished, that all our feasts were truly love feasts. I mean that the rich among
us would imitate holy Job, and not eat their morsels alone, but invite those of
the poorer sort to their Tables, whom Christ bids to his board: or at least
that they would defaulke a great part of that charge, which is spent in
furnishing these luxurious feasts, wherein this City exceeds all in the
Christian world, and convert it to the refreshing of the bowels of poor
prisoners, or clothing the naked, or redeeming captives, or to some other pious
and charitable use: so should your City and Company feasts be true Agapae,

love feasts; and you testify to all the world, what account you make of
Christ his new commandment in my Text, Love one another.

Of all speeches we ought to give most heed to those of our Savior; of all
speeches of our Savior, to his commands; of all commands, to this of Christian
charity: 1. Because it is a rare and choice one: A new. 2. Because it is a
sweet and easy one: To love. 3. Because it is a just and reasonable one: One
another. 4. Because we have such a singular President for it: As I have loved
you, etc.


We have all Athenian ears, thirsting after news: behold a new. We all
profess obedience to Laws: behold a commandment. We all acknowledge Christ
to be our supreme Lord, who has absolute power of life and death; hearken
then to his Proclamation, I give unto you. If he had laid a heavy burden and
hard yoke upon us, we must have submitted our necks and shoulders to it, and
we have all reason so to do. For he took Esaias 53.4. Surely be has born our
griefs, and carried our sorrows.
upon him our infirmities, and bare our sorrows: how much more when he lays
so sweet a yoke upon us as to love? so light a burden as to love one another?
Nothing more agreeable to our nature than to love, nothing more needful to our
condition than to love one another. We all stand in need one of another, this
need is supported by love, this love is commanded by Christ, this command of
Christ is new.

As M. Tul. Cicer. Orator. Numerum verborum, numero sententiarum complexus est.
Tully spoke of Thucydides his style, that in his Orations every word was a
sentence. And as Saint Jerome observes in the Apocalypse, Quot verba, tot
sacramenta, that there are so many mysteries in it as words: so we may say of
this Text, Quot verba, tot argumenta; so many words, so many arguments: so many
notions, so many motions or motives to this duty of mutual love. To which we
ought to have a special eye, and extraordinary regard:

First, because it is a new commandment.

Secondly, because it is Christ's commandment, I give unto you.

Thirdly, because it is an amiable and easy one: To love.

Fourthly, because it is a general and indifferent one: Every one.

Fifthly, because it is so just and profitable a one: One another.

Lastly, because it is pressed by such a rare example as the world never had the
like, As I have loved you.

You see the ears that stand above the rest, which by the example of the
Apostles on the Sabbath, I will Mat. 12.1.
rub in the handling of them to stay your spiritual hunger a while.

A new. The first word in my Text is new; and even this may seem new and
strange, that Christ calls here this commandment of love a new commandment,
which is as old as the Law of Moses, nay as the law of nature. For before
Christ made love Gospel, Moses made it written Law; and before Moses made it
written Law, God made it a branch, or rather the root of the law of nature:
before the Evangelist wrote this precept in the Gospel, Moses wrote it in the
Law, and before Moses wrote it in the Law, God wrote it with his own finger in
tables of stone, and long before that in the fleshly tables of Adams heart. How
then does our Savior here term it a new commandment, which is so old, that
Saint John 3.11. This is the message that ye received from the beginning, that
ye love one another.
John himself commends it from the antiquity? As Saint Ambrose spoke of the
Cherubins in Ezekiels vision, Si stabant, quomodo movebant? si movebant,
quomodo stabant? If they stood still, how did they move? if they moved, how did
they stand still? may not we likewise argue the case thus, If the duty of
mutual love be a message received from the beginning, either of the
promulgation of the Law, or the Creation it self; how is it here styled new?
If it be so new in Saint John's Gospel, how is it so old in his Epistle? Every
answer shaped by the Interpreters to this question may serve for a several
exposition of this Text, and a special motive to this duty of mutual love.

First, Mald. in Mat. Multa dum vobiscum versatus sum dedi mandata, multa
documenta, nunc dabo unum quod instat est omnium.
Maldonat resolves it to be an Hebraisme, in which language new, rare, and
most excellent are synonimaes. A new name ( Apoc. 2.) is a most honorable
name. A new song ( Psalm. 69.) a most excellent song. New wine ( Matthew. 26.29.)
vinum praestantissimum alterius generis, the best wine; so here a new
commandment is a rare, a choice, a special, a remarkable one: as if our Lord
had said, Unum praeque omnibus unum, One above all other. Calvin Calvin in hunc
loc. Vult hujus mandati perpetuo vos esse memores, ac si lex esset recens nata.
Scimus leges initio diligentius servari, sensim vero labi ex hominum memoria,
donec tandem obsolescant: ergo Christus quo magis infigat charitatem suorum
animis a novitate eam commendat.
varieth not much from Maldonat, paraphrasing thus, Christ would have us
perpetually mindful of this his precept, as if it were a law newly enacted.
For we know, says he, that laws at the first making of them are carefully
looked unto, and diligently observed; but by degrees wear out of men's memory,
and in the end grow quite into dis-use: therefore Christ, the more to fasten
love in the minds of his, commends it unto them as a new commandment. The
most of the Ancients conceive this commandment to be termed new, because it is
propounded here nova forma, in a new form. In the Law it runs thus, Love thy
neighbor as thy self: but in the Gospel, Love one another as I have loved
you, that is, in some case more than your selves. For indeed so did Christ,
laying down his life for us. Yet Saint Aug. in hunc loc. Novum dicitur ab
effectu quod nos renovet, and exuto vetere novo induat.
Austin has a new way by himself; he says, that the commandment of love is
here said to be NEW from the effect, because it renewes us, and by it we put
off the old man, and put on the new. Let us strike all these strings together,
and make a chord of them: What account ought we to make of, how carefully to
observe the commandment of our Savior, which is a rare and singular one, and
so new: renewed and revived by Christ in the Gospel, and so new: delivered in a
new manner, and after a new form, and so new: enforced by a new president, and
so new: lastly, which makes us new in our minds, in our inward and outward
man, and so new? The most fluent and current sense of the words seems to be
this. Christ had before called his Disciples children, and foretold them that
he was shortly to leave them: therefore he gives them here such counsels and
precepts as fathers usually give their children when they are to take a long
journey. Children, I am now to leave you, who have been your greatest stay and
comfort: now therefore you must be a mutual help and comfort one to another.
My peace I leave with you, my love I commend unto you. I give you now my last
and newest commandment, to love one another as I have loved you. I have loved
you 1. Freely: for you chose not John 15.16.
me, but I chose you. 2. Sincerely: for I have left my Father and a Kingdom
in Heaven to live with you. 3. Exceedingly: for I have resolved to lay John
15.13.
down my life for you. 4. Constantly: for having loved mine own which were in
the world, I loved them to John 13.1.
the end.
Let your love be such one to another, that all that see you may know you by
this badge to be my Disciples.

This cognizance was so bright to be seen in the livery of the Christians of
the Primitive Church, that by their love feasts and charitable contributions,
and having all things in common, and visiting their sick in time of infection,
and having recourse one to another in prisons, and dungeons, and dens, and
caves of the earth, and accompanying one another to the rack, to the gibbet,
to the block, to the fire, to all sorts of most exquisite tortures and
torments, the Heathen knew a man to be a Christian. But this badge grew in
after ages dimmer, and now it is in a manner quite worn out. Which that it might
not come to pass, our Savior in Gorth. in hunc loc. Ideo novum dicit
mandatum, quia semper debet recens esse in cord, quia semper debet dilectio
innovari, ac nunquam per interruptionem aut negligentiam inveterari.
Gorrhams judgment proposes this precept of love in this form of words, A
new commandment I give unto you, that is, such a one as ought to be always
fresh in your mind and memory, and never to wax old, or be blotted out of your
heart by any dis-use or negligence. To come yet nearer to the native and
genuine sense of the words, a law may be said to be new out of a double
consideration: the thing commanded, if it be such a thing as before never fell
under any law and this is the meaning of our Proverb, Novus rex, nova lex, New
lords, new laws; because for the most part new governors and rulers bring in
new customs, proclaim new edicts, and settle new orders in Church and
Commonwealth: new act of commanding; so an old Statute, when it is revived may
be called a new Statute, as an old book when it is reprinted, or an old
fashion laid aside for a long time when it is again taken up, passes for new.
In both these respects this commandment in my Text may be said to be new.

1. First, in respect of the duty commanded. For though mutual love were long
before this enjoined, yet not this love, whereby Christians are required to
love one another as Disciples of one Master, nay as members of one mystical
body, whereof Christ Jesus is the head.

2. Secondly, in respect of the new act of commanding, expressed in these words,

I give unto you. The promises of Christ in the Law, are the Gospel of the Law;
as on the other side, the precepts of Christ in the Gospel, are the Law of the
Gospel: there is James 4.12.
one Lawgiver, who is able to save and destroy; and this Lawgiver is Christ,
the Judge of quick and dead. It belongs to Kings to give Laws to their
subjects, Masters to their servants, Parents to their children: Christ was
their Matthew. 2.1.
King, and their Master, and their Father; for he calls them children,
saying, Little Joh. 13.13, 33.
children, yet a while I am with you. In which of these relations are we to
God; as our King, or our Master, or our Father? are we subjects, servants, or
children? If we are subjects, let us obey our King. If we are his servants,
let us do our Masters will. If we are children, let us keep the commandments
of our Father. Had the 2 Kings 5.13.
Prophet, says Naamans servant, bid thee to do some great thing, would
thou not have done it? How much more when he says unto thee, Wash and be
clean? so may I say unto you, If our Master, our Father, our King had laid a
hard task upon us, we ought to have done it; how much more when he says but
Love as I have loved you, A new commandment I give unto you?

To love. To Arist. 2. rhet. ca. 4. (...).
love is to bear good affection to another, and to be willing and ready to
do him all the good we can for his own sake, without any eye to our selves
therein. Otherwise, if we love him for our pleasure, we love indeed our
pleasure, and not him: if we love him for our profit, we love our profit, and
not him: if we love him for any end of our own, we love our selves, not him.
The Fly loves not the Apothecaries shop, but the sweet ointment there.
Craterus loved not Alexander, but the Crown: and therefore was termed (...) not

loaves which he multiplied by miracle: Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye
seek me not because you saw the miracles; but because you did eat of the
loaves, and were filled. The Schools therefore well distinguish of a double
love, 1. Amor concupiscentiae. 2. Amor amicitiae.
A love of concupiscence, and a love of friendship. If the love of
concupiscence exceed, it degenerateth into either lust, covetousness, or
ambition. If it carry us inordinately to pleasure, it is lust or sensuality. If
to gain, it is covetousness. If to honor, it is ambition. The love of
friendship is of another nature, it loves a person for himself, not for any
by respect; or to speak more properly, it loves Christ in our Christian
brother, and may be well termed the natural heat of Christ's mystical body,
which conveigheth nourishment into all parts, and performs all vital
functions. It is a spiritual grace, knitting the hearts of the faithful in
affection one to another, melting them in compassion one of another, and
dilating and enlarging them in delight and joy one in another.

In the delineation of this plant of Paradise I will imitate the Naturalists,
and describe it by the root, the maine stock, the branches, the blossoms, the
leaves, the fruit. The root is the knowledge of God. For as the beams of the
Sun reflected from thick glasses generate heat; so the light of divine
knowledge incident upon the understanding, and reflected upon the will,
produces in it the ardent affection of the love of God, and from it, as the
maine arm of the tree, issue two branches, the love of our neighbor, and of
our selves. The blossoms on these branches are good meanings, desires, and
purposes, to wish all good to our neighbor, to think well of him, to
congratulate his felicity, and to condole his misery. The leaves are good
speeches, counsels, and prayers. The fruit are good works and almesdeeds, to
correct him in his errors, to comfort him in his troubles, to visit him in his
sickness, and to relieve him in his necessities. And, to speak truth, to love
in truth is to love in deed, and charitable deeds are the deeds and evidences
that certainly prove a good conveighance of this affection. Let us love, says
the Apostle, not in 1 John 3.18. My little children, let us not love in word
not in tongue, but in deed and in verity.
word and in tongue, but indeed and verity. Deed and verity as you hear are
all one: and therefore word only, and vanity and hypocrisy, must go
together, as also the Latin phrase verba dare signifies. True James 1. ult.
religion and undefiled before God even the Father is this, to visit the
fatherless and the widow in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
of the world. I would all who profess religion were of this religion of Saint
James. For the religion which is (I will not say professed) but practiced by
most men, is aptly set forth unto us in the Wezel, quae aure Adrian. Jun. ^mhl.
concipit, parturit ore, which conceives at the ear, and brings forth at
the mouth. It conceives in the ear in the frequent, if not perpetual hearing
of Sermons; but brings forth only at the mouth by discourses of religion,
pious counsels, good words, and liberal prayers, such as these, God help
thee, God relieve thee, God comfort thee, Alas poor soul (alas poor
comfort.) Words be they never so adorned, clothe not the naked: be they never
so delicate, feed not the hungry: be they never so zealous, warm not him that
is starved with cold: be they never so soft, cure not the wounded: be they
never so free, set not free them that are bound, visit not the sick or
imprisoned: in a word, perform not any of those duties which shall be
vouchsafed the naming at the general day of retribution unto all men, which
shall be according to their works, not according to their words. The witty
Epigrammatist deservedly casts a blurre upon Candidus his fair name and
debonaire carriage, because all the fruits of his friendship grew upon his
tongue: Martial Epigr.
Candide kona philn haec sunt tua Candide pnta,
quae tu magniloquus nocte dieque sonas.
Ex opibus tantis veteri fidoque sodali
das nihil, and dicis Candide koina philon.
Thou say, my friend Candidus, that all things are common among friends, but
it seems these words of thine are thy all things. For of all thy wealth and
goods thou make no friend thou have a doite the better, thou give nothing
at all, and yet art most prodigal in thy language, and wearest out that
Proverb threed-bare, (...), All things are common amongst friends. The
Naturalists observe, that the females of Bi^ds oftentimes lay eggs without
cocks, but they are (...), ova subventanea, eggs filled up with wind, unfit
to be hatched: such is the issue of most men's love now a days, it brings
forth partus subventaneos, windy brats, that is, good words, fair promises,
and happy wishes. But though in our gardens of pleasure we nourish many plants
and trees for their beautiful blossoms and goodly flowers, yet it is manifest
out of the 16. Thou shall ear freely of every tree in the garden.
Verse of the second of Genesis, that there grew no tree in the terrestrial
Paradise of God that bare not fruit, neither shall any but such as fructify
be transplanted into the celestial. For, Mat. 3.10.
Every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into
the fire. We read in our Chronicles of King Oswald, that as he sat at table,
when a fair silver dish full of regal delicacies was set before him, and he
ready to fall to, hearing from his Amner that there were great store of poor
at his gate piteously crying for some relief, commanded his Steward presently
to take the dish off the table, and distribute the meat, and beat the dish all
in pieces, and cast it among them: whereat the Bishop his Amner, taking hold of
his hand, was heard to use these or the like speeches, Nunquam veterascet haec
manus, the hand which bears such fruit shall never wither or wax old; and in
part he was a true Prophet: for afterward in a battle where the King was
slain, having his arm first cut off, the arm with the hand being found, were
covered in silver, and kept as a holy Relic; and by this means endured many
hundred of years after the whole body was consumed. That which quenches Hell
fire in the conscience is the blood of Christ, that which applies this blood
is faith, that which quickneth this faith is love, that which demonstrateth
this love are works of mercy and bounty, piety and pity, which are not so much
offices to men, as sacrifices to God: faith cries for these, as Rachel did for
children, Give me fruit, or else I dye. For, James 2.26.
Faith without works is dead, as the body without breath. And can aman (think
we) live by a dead faith? Give, says our Savior, and it shall be given unto
you. Which precept of his was so imprinted in the mind of that noble Matron
Hieron. epitaph. Paul. Mat. Damnum putabat, si quisquam debilis aut esuriens
cibo sustentaretur alterius. Et Cyp. de elecmos. Demus Christo vestimenta
terrena indumenta coelestia recepturi, demus cibum and potum secularem cum
Abrah. Isa. and Jac. ad coeleste convivium venturi.
Paula, that she accounted it a great loss and damage to her, if any
prevented her charity in relieving any poor or distressed member of Christ;
she was a like affected, as if one had taken a great bargain out of her hand:
A great bargain indeed, to lay out money in earthly trash, and receive for it
heavenly treasure; to bestow rags, and receive robes; to give a little broken
meat that perishes to the hungry, and for it to be bid with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob to an everlasting banquet in Heaven. I should close with this sweet
strain of Saint Cyprian, but that there remains another note pricked in the
last words of my Text.

(...), One another. If any demand why Christ adds this clause, enjoining
mutual love: I answer, because gratitude, charity, and necessity inforceth it.
Where love is not answered, there is no gratitude: where kindness is not
requited, there is no justice: where offices of friendship are not mutually
performed, there is no life. All Senec. ep. 48. Alteri vivas oportet, si vis
tibi. Societas nostra lapidum fornici similima est, quae casura nisi invicem
obstarent, hoc ipso sustinentur.
humane societies are like archt-building, in which, unless every stone hold
up another, the whole frame suddenly falls. Howbeit, though gratitude,
justice and necessity plead for correspondency in Christian charity; yet the
world is full of complaints of parents against their children, husbands against
their wives, pastors against their flocks, tutours against their pupills,
masters against their servants. that their providence, love, and care is not
answered in the observance, love, gratitude, and obedience of their inferiors.
Fathers upbraid their children, saying, Amor descendit, non ascendit; Love
descends from us to our children, but ascends not from them to us. Husbands
commence actions of unkindnesse against the wives of their bosom, that the
kinder they are to them the more disloyal they find them. Pastors take up the
Apostles complaint against his Corinthians, that the 2. Cor. 12.15.
more he loved them, the less he was loved again. Tutours murmr, that
their care to break their scholars of ill conditions is recompensed with
hatred. And Masters, that their good usage of their servants is requited with
contempt: whereby you see how needful it was that Christ should with his own
mouth as it were heat the glue to join our affections together, with his own
finger knit the knot to tie our hearts together, with his own hands to write a
new bond to inwrap our souls one in another, and with his own press print
anew in our mind the commandment of mutual love: the characters whereof were
quite worn out of most men's memory. Seneca fitly resembles the mutual and
reciprocal duties of friendship, in giving and receiving benefits one from
another, to a game at Tennis, wherein the ball is tossed backward and forward
from one racket to another, and never falls to the ground; or if it fall, it
is his forfeit who mist his stroke: even so every kind office, wherewith our
friend serves us, ought to be returned back to him, that no courtesy fall to
the ground. The Cherubins faces in the Exodus 37.9.
Arc were one to another: Alter in alterius jacientes lumina vultum. And the
wheels in Ezekiels Ezekiel. 1.16.
vision were one in the midst of the other; to teach us, that we ought not only
to cast a benign aspect one upon another like Cherubins, but also to be
inwardly knit one in another like the wheels: that we may be one in another as
Christ is in John 17.23.
the Father, and we in him; I in them, and they in me, that they may be made
perfect in one. Wheresoever almost in holy Scripture this obligation of love is
mentioned, the condition is expressed that it be mutual: as in affection, Be
like Romans 12.10.
one to another: in courtesy, to salute Romans 16.16.
one another: in humility, to wash John 13.14.
one another feet: in love, to serve Gal. 5.13.
one another: in hospitality, to 1 Pet. 4.9.
entertain one another: in patience, to Colos. 3.13.
forbear one another: in compassion, to bear Gal. 6.2.
one another burdens: in devotion, to pray Jam. 5.16.
one for another: in holy communication, to 1. These. 5.11.
edify one another. Here moral Philosophy goes hand in hand with Divinity,
demonstrating that true friendship cannot but be mutual, because the
foundation of it is a similitude of manners and dispositions: which similitude
being a relation, cannot but be in both. And daily experience teaches us, that
as fire in an apt subject generateth fire; so love begets love. I will tell
thee, says Seneca ep. 9. Ego tibi monstrabo amatorium sine medicamento, sine
herba: Si amari vis, ama.
Seneca, how thou may make another love thee, without any love potion, spell
or witchcraft: if thou desire to be beloved, love thou first sincerely and
entirely. This recipe is approved by Arist rhet. l. ^. (...).
Aristotle, who says, that of all men they are the most lovely, that are most
loving. And by the Poet, who advises him who desires to endeare the
affections of another to himself, first to endeare his affections to her, and
to kindle fully that fire in his own breast, which he would have burn in
hers. Sit procul omne nefas, ut ameris, amabilis esto.

Plato writes under this his probatum est, and he instanceth in Socrates and
Alcibiades; the one whereof had no sooner began a health of love, but the other
pledged him in the same cup, atque ita mutuum imbiberunt amorem. He must needs
be of a very ill disposition, qui amorem si nolit impendere, nolit rependere,
who if he will not begin love, and provoke this affection in another, will not
yet repay love, and answer love with love, and courtesy with courtesy,
considering that as the affection is mutual, so the gain is reciprocal. As
in a Hop-yard the poles sustain the Hops, and the Hops by embracing adorn the
poles: and as in a building the walls bear up the roof, and the roof keeps
the walls and timber from wet; so it is among friends: the wise directs the
strong, and the strong defends the wise; the wealthy maintains the
honorable, and the honorable supporteth the wealthy.

There is not only a re-action between natural, but also between moral
agents. Philosophy demonstrateth omne agens repati, and omne patiens reagere,
that every agent suffers from his patient, and every patient works again
upon the agent, either in the same or in a diverse and contrary kind. In the
same kind, as when the hammer and the anvile one harden the other: or when two
Millstones grate one on the other, or two tools whet and sharpen one the
other: In a diverse and contrary kind, as when the warm hand heateth the cold,
the cold hand cools the warm: the stone dries the drop of rain, and the
drop moisteneth the stone; And in physic, the corasives sharpen the
lenitives, and the lenitives mitigate the corasives. In like manner every one
that does good should receive, and every one that receives from another should
do good to the other, either in the same kind, as when two Preachers like
lights kindle one the others knowledge, or two Physicians heal one the other,
or two Bone-setters set one the others joints, or two Lawyers plead one for the
other, or two Soldiers fight one for the other: Or in a diverse and contrary
kind, as when the confident Christian comfort the weak, and the weak
Christian by relating his conflicts and temptations, is a means to keep the
strong and confident Christian from presumption; the zealous professor
inflameth the moderate, and the moderate temperateth the zealous; the rich
supplyeth the want of the poor, and the poor takes away from the superfluity
of the rich. Thus in the same kind, or in a diverse and contrary, every one
that is willing may hold correspondency and fair quarter in love. If no
otherwise we can requite the kindness of our friends, yet in thankful
acceptance we may; and the acknowledgement of the debt of love is a good part
of the payment. The jewel which is illustrated by the Sun beams, colors
the beams; and the earth which receives moisture from the sky, repayeth it
back again in vapors and exhalations: yea the rocks and stones which
receive a sound from the air before it be fully given, return it by an
echo; only self-love and ingratitude return nothing back again.
Self-love is a bad creditour, it will lay out nothing; and ingratitude is a
bad debtour, it will repay nothing. The former resembles the Pumish stone,
from which no moisture at all can be extracted; the later is like the stone of
Syphnos, which being steeped in oil becomes the harder by it: such is an
ungrateful person, the better you are to him, the worse he demeaneth himself
toward you.

Dearly beloved Christians, if any man could live of himself, he might have
some color to live to himself only: but since all civil life and humane
society is maintained by giving and receiving, as the natural is by taking in
and letting out breath; let us abandon those vices above all others, that stop
the intercourse of courteous offices passing from one friend to another, and
let us all embrace that Christian virtue, which joyneth all men unto us, and us
unto all men in the glue of affections and bond of perfection. Let us give,
that we may receive: let us sow liberally, that we may reap plentifully: let
us scatter abroad earthly, that we may gather heavenly treasure.

While we have time let us do good unto all, especially to the household of
faith; and in this time of fullness think of the empty belly, and out of our
superfluity supply their extreme want. We read in the Jewish Talmud, that the
grapes in Babel upon a time sent to the vines in Judea for some of their broad
leaves to overshade them; otherwise the scorching heat would consume them in
such sort, that they could never come to maturity. This Apologue shall serve
for my Apology, if I press you at this time with all the interest I have in
your love, nay with all the power that I have as a Minister of Christ Jesus, to
contribute something to the necessity of your brethren. You know well the
grapes I told you of, which send to you, as the grapes in Babel did to the
vines in Judea, to impart unto them some of your sap, and to shade them under
your well spread boughs, or else they will undoubtedly wither and perish. I
beseech you in the bowels of Christ Jesus come not behind, but rather go
before others in pious bounty and Christian charity. So the good will of him
that dwelt in the bush make you all like the tree in the first Psalm, planted
by the rivers of waters, that brings forth his fruit in due season, and his
leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever he does it shall prosper.

THE STEWARDS ACCOUNT. A Sermon preached in the Abbey Church at WESTMINSTER.
THE XXI. SERMON.
LUKE 16.2. Give an account of thy stewardship: for thou may be no longer
Steward.


Right Reverend, right Honorable, right Worshipful, etc.
THat I may give a better account of the mysteries of saving truth, and you of
the blessings of this life, whereof God has made us Stewards in different
kinds, I have chosen for the subject of my serious meditations, and the object
of your religious consideration, this parcel of sacred Scripture, which
admonishes us all to look to our several accounts, to examine and clear
them, that we may have them ready and perfect when our Lord and Master shall
call for them from every of us by name, and in particular, saying, Give an
account of thy stewardship.

The words are part of a Parable, which resembles the tents of Solomon, vile
and black without, but full of precious things within. For on the outside we
read nothing but a narration of an unjust Steward, or crafty Merchant, who
being called to an account, and justly fearing to be turned out of his place
upon it, in time provideth against the worst, and takes a course to make
himself whole by cheating his Master: but in the inside there are many
beautiful Images of divine doctrines, drawn by the pensill of the holy Ghost,
which I purpose to set before you, after I have opened the veil of the letter,
by showing you 1. What are the goods for which the Steward is to reckon. 2. Who
is the Steward charged with these goods. 3. What manner of account he is to
give.


Touching the first, the learned Interpreters of this mysterious Parable are at
strife, and (if I may so speak) in law about the goods left in the hands of
this unfaithful Steward. Some put temporal blessings only and worldly wealth
in his account. Others by goods understand the Word and Sacraments principally,
wherewith the Ministers of the Gospel are trusted. But Bonaventure lighting one
candle by another, expounds this Parable by the other Parable of the five
talents, and takes the goods here committed to the Steward, to be those five
talents delivered to every man to trade and negotiate withal for God his
Master: and thus he tells them, 1. Naturae, 2. fortunae, 3. potentiae, 4.
scientiae, 5. gratiae: the first of nature, the second of wealth, the third of
power, the fourth of knowledge, the fifth of grace. By nature he understands
all the natural faculties of the mind, and organs and instruments of the
body. By wealth, riches and possessions. By power, offices and authority. By
knowledge, all arts and sciences. By grace, all the gifts of the spirit, and
supernatural infused habits, such as are faith, hope, and charity, etc.
whereunto if he had added a most precious Jewel, which if it be once lost can
never be recovered, viz. our time, he had given a true and perfect Inventary
of all the goods, for which the unfaithful Steward in my Text is called to an
account.

Touching the second, about whom there is as great contestation and variety of
opinions, as about the goods themselves. Gaudentius makes a Steward of the
Devil, who justly deserves the name of an unjust servant, for wasting his
lords substance, that is, spoiling his creatures, and robbing him of his
chiefest treasure, the souls of men. But if the Devil be the Steward, who is
the accuser of this Steward? doubtless he can be no other than the Devil,
whose style is the Revel. 12.10. The accuser of the brethren is cast down,
which accuses them before the Lord day and night.
Accuser of the brethren. The Devil therefore is not the Steward here meant,
whom God never set over his family, nor trusted him with any of his goods since
he became a Devil. Tertullian conceives the people of the Jews, to whom the
Tables and Pots of Manna, and Oracles of God were committed, to be the Stewards
called to an account in my Text for the abuse of these holy things. If we
follow this Interpretation, neither the Parable nor the Text any way concerns
us Christians: therefore Saint Ambrose, Saint Chrysostom, Saint Augustine,
Beda, Euthymius, and Theophylact enlarge the Stewards Patent, and put all rich
men in the world in it, who are advised to make friends with the unrighteous
Mammon they have in their hands, that when they fail their friends may receive
them into everlasting habitations. Lastly, Saint Jerome and others put in hard
for the Ministers of the Gospel, to whom they assign the first place in the
Patent, as being Stewards in the most eminent kind, and so styled both by our
Luke 12.42. Who then is the faithful and wise Steward whom his lord shall make
ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?
Savior, and his Tit. 1.7. A Bishop must be blameless, as the Steward of God,
and 1 Cor. 4.1. Let a man so account of us, as Stewards of the mysteries of God.
Apostle.

To reconcile these opinions, and make a perfect concord of seeming discords, I
understand by the great husband or rich man in the Parable Almighty God, whose
house is the whole world, and all things in it his wealth. Men endued with
reason and understanding are his Stewards, whom he has set over this great
household, to govern the rest of his creatures, and employ the riches of his
goodness to the advancement of his glory. These are all accountable unto him:
the Jews peculiarly for such things as he bequeathed to his children by the
Old Testament; the Christians for such things as he has bequeathed to them by
the New: the unregenerate are to reckon with him for the gifts of nature; the
regenerate for the graces of the spirit: the rich for his wealth, the noble for
his honor, the mighty for his power, the learned for his knowledge, every man
for that he receives of the riches of his mercy in spiritual, temporal, or
corporal blessings. In which regard we may rightly term Kings Stewards of
their crowns, Lords of their lands, Captains of their armies, Bishops of
their diocese, Pastors of their parishes, Householders of their families, and
every private man of the closet of his conscience, and treasury of his heart.
For all Kings are Gods subjects, all Captains are his soldiers, all Teachers
are his scholars, all Masters are his servants, and consequently all Lords his
stewards. In a word, there is none of so high a calling in the world that is
more, nor any of so low a calling or small reckoning that is less than a
Steward of the King of kings, who shall one day call not only all men of sort,
but even all sorts of men to a most strict and exact account; Kings for their
scepters, Magistrates for their swords, Officers for their staves, Bishops for
their crosiers, Soldiers for their weapons, Clerks for their pens, Landlords
for their possessions, Patrons for their advowsons, Merchants for their trade,
Tradesmen for their crafts, Husbandmen for their ploughes, calling to every one
in particular, Give an account of thy Stewardship.

Touching the third, some render the original (...), render a reason; others
give an account: some actus tui, of thy Factorship, as Tertullian; others
villicationis tuae, of thy Bailiwicke, as Saint Jerome; a third sort
dispensationis tuae, of thy Stewardship, as the Kings Translators. A great
difference in sound of words, but little or none at all in sense: for though a
Factor in foreign parts, and a Steward at home, and a Baily in the country are
distinct offices, and different employments; yet to the meaning of this Parable
they are all one. For they all deal with other men's money, rent, or goods, and
are all liable to an account, and upon it dischargeable. And in this place,
whether we translate (...), a reason, or a reckoning, all comes to one
reckoning: for upon the matter, to render a reason of moneys disbursed by us,
is to give an account. A careful Steward or Accomptant in any kind, besides
the casting of the sums, sets down a reason of every parcel of money laid
out by him after this manner: Item in provision so much. Item in reparations.
Item for workmens hire. Item for law suits, etc. thus much. Howbeit they that
delight in tithing Mint and Cummin, and nicely distinguishing between words of
very like, if not altogether the same signification, observe that in precise
propriety of speech we are said to give an account how, but render a reason
why we have disbursed such moneys: and that our account must be of our
Masters goods; but our reason of our own actions: and we are accountable
only for that we have laid out; but we are answerable, or to yield a reason to
our Master as well for that we have not laid out for his profit in due season,
as for that we have laid out for his necessities. For he expects gain of
every talent committed to us, and will not only accept his own without
advantage. The things we are to account for are contained under these three
heads: 1. Goods. 2. Gifts. 3. Graces.
By goods, I understand the blessings of this life, which the Philosopher
calls bona fortunae. By gifts, indowments of nature, which they call bona
naturae. By graces, divine virtues, which the Schools call habitus infusos. In
our book of account

Under the first head, viz. goods of this world, we must write, How bestowed.

Under the second, viz, gifts of nature, we must write, How employed.

Under the third, viz. graces of the spirit, we must write, How improved.

And if it appear upon our accounts, that we have well bestowed the first in
holy, pious, and charitable uses; and well employed the second in carefully
discharging the general duties of a good Christian, and diligently performing
the particular works of our special calling; and have much increased the
third, by our spiritual trade with God, by hearing, meditating, reading,
conferring, praying, and the constant practice of piety, and exercise of every
divine virtue and grace: then our Master will say unto us, Well Mat. 25.21.
done good and faithful servant, thou have been faithful in a little, be
thou ruler over much, enter into thy Masters joy. But if we have kept
unprofitably, or wasted riotously the first, the wealth of the world; and
retchlesly abused the second, the dowry of nature, or by idleness let it rust;
and rather diminished than increased the third, the treasury of spiritual
graces; then we are to render a reason, and make answer for these defaults: and
if our answer be not the better, to make satisfaction to our Lord to the
uttermost farthing, after we are put out of our Stewardship, as the reason
annexed to the command implies, For thou may be no longer Steward.

Give then an account of thy Stewardship, that is, of thy life; whereof thou
art not lord but steward, to spend it in thy Masters service, and lay it down
for his honor. Cast up all the particulars of thy life, sum up thy thoughts,
words, and deeds: read rationem 1. Mali commissi. 2. Boni omissi. 3. Temporis
amissi.
Make answer for 1. The evil thou have committed. 2. The good thou have
omitted. 3. The time thou have pretermitted or mis-pent, either in 1. Doing
nothing at all. 2. Or nothing to the purpose. 3. Or that which is worse than
nothing, tracing the endless mazes of worldly and sinful vanities.



Now to proceed from the exposition of the words, to the handling of the parts
of this Scripture, which are evidently two: 1. A command, Division.
wherein I observe 1. The person commanding, God, under the name of a rich man.
2. The persons commanded, all men, under the name of Stewards. 3. The thing
commanded, to give an account. 4. The office for which this account is to be
given, a Stewardship. 5. The propriety of this office, thine.
2. A reason, wherein I note 1. The Stewards discharge, and quitting his
office, thou may, etc. 2. The time, now.



Which particular points of observation direct us to these doctrinall
conclusions, 1. That God is Lord of all. 2. That all men are Stewards. 1. Not
Lords. 2. Not Treasurers.
3. That all Stewards shall be called to an account. 4. That the office for
which they are to account is their own Stewardship, not another. 5. That upon
this account they shall be discharged.


These conclusions resemble the rings spoken of by St. Aug l 21. de civit. Dei.
Austin, whereof the first being touched by the Lodestone drew the second, the
second the third, the third the fourth, and the fourth the fifth. For here the
first point infers the second: If God be Lord of all, men can be but
Stewards. The second infers the third: If all men are Stewards, all men are
accountable. The third the fourth: If all men are accountable for a
Stewardship, this Stewardship must needs be their own. The fourth the fifth:
If they are to account for their own Stewardship, certainly either at the
private audit, the day of their death, or at the public audit, the day of
judgment, after which they shall be no longer Stewards, but either Lords in
Heaven, or Slaves in Hell. Wherefore, O Christian, whosoever thou art, whether
thou swayest the scepter, or handlest the spade: whether thou sit at the
stern, or rowest at the oar: whether thou buildest on the roof, or diggest
at the foundation, make full account of it, thou shall be called to an account
for thy work; be not idle therefore nor secure. Secondly, that for which thou
art to account is no place of authority, but an office of trust: no Lordship,
but a Stewardship: be not proud of it, nor unfaithful in it. Thirdly, this
office of trust is not a Treasurership, but a Stewardship; be not covetous, nor
unprofitable. Fourthly, this Stewardship is not another, but thine own; be
not curious, nor censorious. Fifthly, this thy Stewardship is not perpetual,
but for a time, it expireth with thy life; be not negligent, nor fore-slacke
thy opportunity of making friends to receive thee into everlasting habitations
after thou must relinquish thy office.

That God is Lord of all, his claim unto all is a sufficient evidence to us.
For he cannot pretend a false title, who is truth it self: neither can any
question his right in any Court, who is author of all laws, as he is maker of
all things: which are his by a threefold right, 1. Of Creation. 2. Purchase. 3.
Possession.


1. Of Creation: for that which a man makes is his own.

2. Of Purchase: for that which any one purchases is his own.

3. Of Possession: for that which any one is possessed of time out of mind is
his own. By the first of these the Father may claim us, as all things else,
who made all. By the second the Son, who redeemed the world. By the third the
holy Ghost, who inhabiteth us, and after a special manner possesses us. Isa.
66.1.
Heaven is my throne, says God, and the earth is my footstool. You see then
great reason why God should be compared to a rich man, with whom all the rich
men in the world may not compare, neither in lands, nor in cattle, nor in money
and treasure. Not in lands: for the bounds of the earth are his land-markes,
and the Sun is his Surveyer. Nor in cattle: for Psalm. 50.
every beast of the forest is his, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. Not
in money or plate: for Haggai 2.
gold is mine, and silver is mine, says the Lord. Nor lastly in goods: for
that golden chain of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 22.23.
All are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is Gods, may be drawn backward
by the same linkes thus: All are Gods, and God is Christ's, and Christ is ours.

Yea, but it may be argued against this conclusion, that God has small or no
demaines, in as much as he holds nothing in his own hands, having let out
(if I may so speak) the heaven to Saints and Angels, the air to Birds and
Foul, the water to Fish, the earth to Men and Beasts to dwell in it, and reap
the fruits thereof. But the answer is easy: for though God make no benefit of
any thing to himself, yet he keeps the right and propriety of all things in
himself; and he must needs keep all things in his hands, who clincheth the
Heavens with his fist. Moreover, he requires homage of all his creatures,
which are but his tenants at will, or to speak more properly, servants to be
thrust out of office and state upon the least offense given, or dislike taken.
Which condition is far worse than the former. For a tenant has some kind of
propriety and interest in that which he holds of his Landlord; and if he
perform all covenants, provisoes, and conditions of his lease or agreement
with his Lord, he may not without apparent wrong be suddenly turned out of
house and home, much less may his Lord seize upon all his goods, and dispose
of them at his pleasure. The case stands far worse with a Steward, who has
nothing he may call his but his office, for which he may be always called to
an account, and upon it discharged. Yet this is the state of the greatest
States and Potentates of the world; they have no certainty in any thing they
possess or enjoy. For which cause Saint Hom. 2. ad po^. Antioch. Omnes usum et
fructum habemus, dominium nemo.
Chrysostom finds great fault with the wills and testaments of great
personages in his time, by which they bequeath lands, lordships, and
inheritances in their own name and right, as if those things were absolutely in
their power: they usurp, says he, upon Gods prerogative, who has given unto
them the use and profit of the things of this life, but not the dominion, no
nor propriety in strict point of law, unless a man will account that to be his
own, for which he is to give an account to another. The Steward is no whit the
richer, because he has more to account for; but in this regard more
solicitous and obnoxious. Which observation we may crown with this corollary,
That they who seem to have the greatest and best estates in this world, are in
the worst condition of any, if their gifts be not eminent, and their care and
industry extraordinary, to make the best advantage to their Master of the many
talents committed to them. The reason hereof is easy to guess at, and was
long ago yielded by Gregory the Greg. sup. Evang. dominic. Cum augentur dona,
crescunt rations donorum.
great, As their means and incomes, so their accounts grow. For Luke 12.48. To
whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
to whom more is given, more shall be required of him. To speak nothing of the
many employments and distractions of men in great place, which sacrilegiously
rob them of their sacred hours devoted to prayer and meditation, and bereave
them of themselves, I had almost said deprive them of their God, and the sweet
fellowship of his holy Spirit: they must give so much audience to others, that
they can give but little attendance on God. Public employments, and eminent
places in Church and Commonwealth expose those that hold them to the view of
all men, their good parts, whatsoever they have, are in sight, and their bad
too: which men are more given to mark ( quis enim solemn fere intuetur, nisi
cum deficit? when do men so gaze upon the Sun, as in the eclipse?) in so
much that the very word Mark is commonly taken in the worst sense for some
scarre, blemish, or deformity. A small coal raked up in the ashes may live a
great while, which if it be raked out and blown, soon dies and turns into
ashes. They that were kept in close prison by Dionysius, enjoyed the benefit of
their sight in those dark rooms, which they lost, when they were suddenly
brought forth into the open air, by the over bright reflection of the Sun
beams from a wall new white-limed. Which I speak not to detract from dignity,
or obscure glory, or disparage nobility, or dishonor worldly preferments or
honors in them, whose merits have been their raisers. For these honorable
titles and dignities are the luster of eminent quality, the garland of true
virtue, the crown of worldly happiness, and to the lowly, high favors of the
Almighty. The mark I aim at is to give some content to them whose places are
inferior to their virtues; and advice also to those whom God has or shall
raise to great places and high preferments. Let the former consider, that there
can be no obscurity where the Sun shines; that he is truly honorable not
always, whom the Prince puts in high places, but he, upon whom God lifts
the light of his countenance; that it is sufficient that he sees their good
parts, from whom they expect their reward; that the more retired their life is,
the less exposed to envy, and more free from danger; that the fewer suitors or
clients they have to them, the more liberty they have to be clients to God; the
less troubles they have about their temporal estate, the better they may
look to their spiritual, and secure their eternal: lastly, that the less
they are trusted with, the easier their account shall be at the great audit. On
the other side, let those who have degrees accumulated, and honors and
preferments heaped upon them, seek rather to diminish their accounts, than to
increase their receipts, and pray to God daily for less of his goods, and more
of his grace, that they may make a better account at the last day, and then
receive a Kingdom in Heaven for a Stewardship on earth.

Beloved brethren, you see your calling, you are Stewards not Lords, think
upon it seriously that you may be every day, you shall be one day, called to a
strict account for all that you have or enjoy. This was the first point of
special consideration I recommended to you from the nature of our office,
which is here called a Stewardship. The second was, that we are not Gods
Treasurers, but his Stewards, and that our employment is not to gather up and
keep, but to expend and distribute our Masters moneys for the maintenance and
relief of his poor servants, according to their several necessities. And
look whatsoever we lay out in this kind, shallbe allowed upon our accounts,
and put upon our Masters score, who acknowledges it to be his own debt: Mat.
10.42.
Whatsoever you do unto any of these little ones, you do it unto me. You
clothe me in the naked, you feed me in the hungry, you relieve me in the
distressed, you visit me in the imprisoned, you ransom me in the captive,
you cure me in the wounded, you heal my pierced hands and feet with the oil
which you pour into their wounds. Thrice happy Stewards we, if we can so
handle the matter, that we may bring our Master indebted to us for the interest
of his own money. For he, Prove. 19.15.
who gives to the poor, lends to the Lord, and that which he has given
will he pay it him again. So exceeding bountiful is he, that he gives us
abundantly to pay our fellow servants, and pays us double for giving it
them. After our Savior had healed the man with a Mark 3 5.
withered hand, to show that it was whole, he commanded him to stretch it
forth: in like manner, if we desire to show and make a sensible proof that
the sinews of our faith are not shrunk, that the hands of our charity are not
withered, we must stretch them out, and reach our alms to the poor: which we
will be more willing and ready to do, if we reflect often upon our office
shadowed out under this Parable; which is to be Stewards, not Treasurers of
Gods manifold blessings. Secondly, if we consider that we lay out nothing of
our own, but of our Masters purse; And thirdly, that whatsoever we lay out for
him upon earth, we lay up for our selves heaven: according to that rule of
Saint Leo ser. quod. Thesaurum co^dit in coelo, qui Christum, pascit in
paupere: manus pauperis ga^aphylatium Christi.
Leo, He lays up treasure in heaven, who feeds Christ in the poor; the
poor man's hand is Christ's box. This branch of our duties, which is to be
always fruitful in good works, extends farther than the expending of
moneys or good usage of the blessings of this life. For all the members of our
body; and faculties of our foul, and graces of the spirit are pa^^ of our
Masters goods, and must be employed in his service, and occupied for his
profit. Besides all these we are accountable to him for our time, which we
may not wastefully and prodigally lavish out in sports and pastimes; but so
thriftily expend upon the necessary works of our calling, that we may save a
good part to consecrate it to exercises of piety and devotion, whereby we may
multiply the talent of grace committed unto us. There is no covetousness
commendable but of time, of which yet most men and women are most prodigal
Senec. ep. 1. Quem mihi dabis qui aliquod pretium tempori ponat, qui diem
aestimet? etc.
spenders. Any jewel that is lost may be found, yea though it be cast in the
sea, as Polycra^es his ring was, which a fish in his mouth brought back into
his Kitchen. Yea, the treasure of grace and pearl of the word, which the rich
Merchant sold all that he had to buy; yea God himself after we have lost him
may be found, if we seek him in time: only lost time can never be recovered.
Wherefore that we may not lose any moment of the time allotted, which is so
precious, but put it to the best use for the increase of our talent of
knowledge, I pass from the Stewardship of the things of this life, to the
account we are to give of this Stewardship.

In which that we may more readily and safely proceed, first I will set up a
great light: secondly, remove some rubs out of the way. The light shall be a
clear confirmation of the truth of the point out of the Scriptures, which are
most evident and express, both for the unavoidable necessity and strict
severity of the last judgment. We profess in our Creed, that Christ who now
sits at the right hand of his Father in heaven, shall from thence come to
judge the quick and the dead; and we have sure ground in Scripture to build
this article upon. For Acts 10 42.
there we read, that Christ is ordained of God to be Judge of the quick and
the dead: and that Romans 14.10.
we shall all stand before his judgment seat: nay, that we 2 Cor. 5.10.
must all appear before his tribunal: which is so certain a thing to come to
pass, that Saint Apoc. 20.12, 13.
John in a vision saw it as present; And I saw the dead small and great stand
before God, and the books were opened, and they were judged according to the
things wrote in those books. Now for the terror of that day, I tremble almost
to rehearse how it is described in holy Scriptures, by S. Apoc. 20.11.
John, I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the
earth and heaven fled away: and by Saint 1 Pet. 4.17.
Peter, The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God, and if
it begin there, what shall the end of them be that obey not the Gospel? and if
the righteous shall scarce be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner
appear? It is hard to say, whether the antecedents are more direful, or the
concomitants more doleful, or the consequents more dreadful. The antecedents
are formidable: The Mat. 24.29.
Sun shall be darkened, and the Moon shall be turned into blood, and the
stars shall fall from the skies, and the powers of heaven shall be sh^^^^
Luke 21.25, 26.
In the earth shall be distress of Nations, and perplexity, and the sea and
t^^ waters shall roar, and men's hearts shall fail them for fear, and for
looking after those things that are coming on the earth. The concomitants are
lamentable: Behold, he Apoc. 1.7.
comes in the clouds, and all eyes shall see him, and all kindreds of the
earth shall mourn before him. And yet the conseque^^ are more fearful than
either the antecedants or concomitants. For the books of all men's consciences
shall be spread abroad, and every man shall answer for all the Eccles. 12.14.
works that he has done, nay for every Mat. 12.36.
word he has spoken, nay for every thought, purpose, and intent of the heart.
For when the Lord comes, he will bring to light the 1 Cor. 4.5.
hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the heart.

Having set up a fair light, I will now take away some blocks and r^^^ that
lie in the way of my discourse. The first is, that God executes judgment in
this world; and therefore Salvianus has written a book De^^^^^ senti Dei
judicio, of Gods providence over his Church, and present judgment. Does he
not open his treasures to the righteous, and pour down the vialls of his
wrath upon the wicked in this life? Does not Saint Paul affirm, that those
that believe are Romans 5.1.
justified already? And Saint John, that those that believe not are condemned
John 3.18.
already. What place then remains for a future trial?

Secondly, immediately upon our death our soul is carried either by good
Angels into Abraham's bosom, or by evil into the dungeon of hell: what then
need they come to the general assizes who have received their doom at the
quarter sessions?

Thirdly, if all men's consciences shall be ripped up, and all their secret
sins be discovered in the face of the Sun at the day of judgment, that day
cannot be but dreadful to the most righteous man on earth: yet Christ says to
his Disciples, Luke 21.28.
When these things come to pass, lift you up your heads; for your redemption
draws nigh: and they in this regard long for his second coming, and pray
continually, Come Lord Apoc. 22.20.
Jesu, come quickly.

The first rub is thus removed: though Gods judgments overtake some, yet not
all in this life. For the afflictions of the godly, and the prosperity of the
wicked were a great eyesore to Psalm. 73.12.
David and Jerem. 5.28.
Jeremy Moreover, God has rewards both temporal and eternal; the former he
dispenceth in this life, the later in that which is to come. He that believes
is justified already before God, and in the sense of his own conscience: for
he has peace with God. And in like manner he that believes not is condemned
already in Gods decree, and he has received also the sentence of condemnation
within himself, as a fellon is hanged in the law, and may know what his
sentence shall be before it be executed or pronounced against him. This
hinders not but that the public sentence shall pass upon both at the last
day for eternal salvation or damnation.

The second is thus removed: Immediately upon death every soul knows what
she is to trust to, but this it not known to the world. Besides, the body
must be rewarded or punished as well as the soul: therefore partly to clear
the justice of God in the sight of men and Angels; partly, to render to the
body and soul that have been partners in evil and good their entire
recompense, after the private session at our death, God has appointed a
public assizes at the day of judgment.

The third rub is thus taken away: The day of judgment is both terrible and
comfortable to the godly; terrible in the beginning, comfortable in the end:
terrible in the accusation by Satan, comfortable in the defense by Christ our
Advocate: terrible in the examination, but comfortable in the sentence. Yea,
but their sores are laid open, and they are foul: their debts are exhibited,
and they are very many: their rents in their conscience are showed, and they
are great. It is true, their sores are laid open, but anointed with Balsamum:
their debts are exhibited, but with a fair acquittance signed with Christ's
blood: their rents in their conscience are seen, but mended and filled up with
jewels of grace. It is far otherwise with the wicked; their sores appear
without any salve; their debts appear, but no acquittance; their rent in their
conscience appears, and remains as wide as ever it was, being never made up
or mended by repentance: therefore they cry Apoc. 6.16.
to the mountains, fall on us, and to the hills, cover us from the presence of
the Lord, and from the wrath of the Lamb.

This point of doctrine is not more evident in the proof, than profitable in
the use, which is threefold: 1. To comfort the innocent. 2. To terrify the
secure. 3. To instruct all.


First, to comfort the innocent. For many that have walked sincerely before God
have been censured for hypocrites; many innocents have been falsely condemned,
many just men have suffered for righteousness sake, and many faithful
Christians have been adjudged to merciless flames for their most holy
profession. To all these the day of judgment will be the brightest day that
ever shone on them. For then their innocence shall break out as the light, and
their righteous dealing as the noone day: then they shall have the hand of
their false accusers, and judge their Judges: then they shall see him for whom
they have stood all their life time, and strived even to blood. Every loss
they have sustained for his sake shall be then their gain, every disgrace
their honor: for every tear they have shed they shall receive a pearl, for
every blew stripe a saphir, for every green wound an emerald, for every drop of
blood a ruby to be set in their crown of glory.

Secondly, it serves much for the terror of the wicked, who go on
confidently in their lewd courses, and proceed from evil to worse, adding
drunkenness to thirst: let these know, that Romans 2.5.
they heap wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous
judgment of God: and that as the farther back the axe is fetched, the heavier
is the stroke; so the longer their punishment is deferred, the heavier in the
end it will fall upon them. Let them who fear not to do wrong, but carry
their sin with a high hand, bearing themselves upon their wealth, or some
potent friend at Court know that they shall be brought to Christ's bar ore
tenus, and that none upon earth shall be able to rescue them. Let them who lay
snares in the dark, and look for their prey in the twilight, and say in
their hearts no eye sees us, know, that God has Apoc. 1.14.
eyes like a flaming fire, enlightening the darkest corners of the inmost
rooms: and that he Psalm. 50.21.
will reprove them, and set their sins in order before their eyes: and that
what they commit in secret, and would not for a world that any witnesses should
be by, shall be brought to an open examination before men and Angels.

Thirdly, to instruct all so to live, that they may not fear to come before
the face of God; so to clear their accounts here, that they need not to dread
their examination there. To this use the holy Ghost points, 2 Pet. 4.11, 12,
14.
Seeing that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought
ye to be in all holy conversation? how diligent, that we may be found of him
in peace without spot and blameless? When Alcibiades came to visit Eras.
Apoph. Atqui inquit potius quemadmodum rationem non redderes, laborares.
Pericles, and found him very busy about his accounts, Why (says he) do
thou thus trouble thy self in seeking to make up thy accounts? thou should
rather use a means to put it off, and think of a course to free thee from
this care, and take order that thou should never be called to an account. I
doubt not but that many Treasurers and Stewards of great Princes make good use
of this advice, and by friends and money so bring it about, that they are never
brought to an account. If we have any such thought we deceive our selves;
there is no dodging with God, no delay, no not for a moment, when he sends
his Pursuivant for us from the high Court of Star Chamber in Heaven: as he
(in Saint Gregory's days) found by woeful experience, who being summoned by
death approaching to bring in his accounts before they were ready, cried out
pitifully, Inducias vel ad horam, O reprivall but for a day, truce but for an
hour, respite but for a minute: but could not obtain it, but was suddenly
posted away to the judgment seat of Christ: and who of us knows whether he
shall be the next to whom God will send a messenger to bring him before him to
render an account of his Stewardship, saying to him in the words of my Text,
Read rationem dispensationis tuae, Give an account

Of thy Stewardship. (Thy.) I know not how it comes to pass, that most men
now a days are sick of Saint Peter's disease, when Christ tells them of
their duty, or fore-sheweth them their end, they are inquisitive about others,
saying, John 21.21.
What shall this man do? There are diverse kinds of Stewards, some of powers,
some of wealth, some of knowledge, some of the Word and Sacraments. Kings
dominions, and Bishops diocesses, and Lords lands, and Rich men's money, and
Clerks writings, and Merchants trades, and Tradesmens shops, and Husbandmens
ploughes are their Stewardship, of which they must give an account; and yet few
there are that mind their own account to their Master for that wherewith they
are trusted: but every man looks to another. The Ploughman censureth the
Tradesman, the Tradesman the Merchant, the Merchant the country Gentleman, the
country Gentleman the Courtier, and all the Ministers of God; as if to impeach
others were to clear themselves. At the audit day they will find that it will
little avail them to say, I am no tot quot, I am no joyner of house to house,
or land to land, I am no usurer, oppressor, or extortioner like other men: when
it will be replied unto them, but thou art like the Pharisee, a deep
dissembler, a counterfeit saint, a secret hypocrite, a slanderous backbiter, a
busie-body, an uncharitable censurer, a streigner of a gnat in others, when thy
self eatest many a fly, nay swallowest many a camel. Plut. tract. de
curiosit.
Plutarch rightly observes, that they who delight to gad abroad, for the most
part have smoaky, nasty, or dankish houses, or at least ill rule, and no
content at home; so when men range abroad, and play the spies and scouts, and
pry into other men's actions, it is a sign that they have a foul house at
home, and ill rule in their own conscience. Wherefore Stella in Luc. Observa
etiam diligenter quod hic non dicit dominus, Read rationem villicationis
alienae, vel read rationem villicationis alterius, sed villicationis tuae; pro
priae enim vitae tuae factorumque tuorum, non alienorum redditurus es rationem
Deo: unusquisque enim redditurus est de propri^s factis rationem.
Stella, according to his name Star, well illustrateth this Text, Give an
account of thy Stewardship, not of any other man's: Pry not into his life, set
not his actions upon the rack, read not a lecture upon his manners; but
meditate and comment upon the book of thine own conscience, that thou may
make even reckonings there. It is an uncivil part to over-looke other men's
papers, especially bills of account, which no way concern us: yet there are
those that take to themselves a liberty to look into, and examine the books
of other men's conscience, not being able to read a letter in their own:
herein resembling the crocodile, which sees nothing in the water, which is his
chiefest place of abode, yet is very quick and sharp sighted on the land out
of his own element to do mischief. I will undertake that any man shall have
work enough to cast up his own accounts, if he look into every particular
for which he is to reckon, every stray thought, every idle word, every
inconsiderate action and sudden passion. God is not herein like unto many great
personages, who seldom or never call their Stewards to an account; or if they
call them, they look over their books and bills but slightly, taking the
visus in gross. For he will certainly call all men to a most strict and
particular account of every moment of time they have spent, of every particular
grace they have received, of every particular duty they have omitted, of every
particular sin they have committed in deed, word, or thought, nay of the
first motion and inclination to evil. The smallest atomi or moates that fly
in the air are discerned in the Sun; so the smallest sins and offenses
shall be discovered at the brightness of Christ's coming. And as the words
that are written with the juice of a Lemmon, cannot be read when they are
written, but may be plainly and distinctly if you hold the paper to the fire,
and dry the letters; so the smallest letters in the book of our conscience, yea
the least notes, and points, and scratches, which neither any other nor our
selves see well now, shall easily be discerned by the fire of the last
judgment. The conceit whereof took such a deep impression in the render heart
of Saint Hierome, that he professes Victor. Reat. in vit. Hieron. Sive comedo,
sive bibo sive quid aliud facio, semper videtur mihi tuba illa terribilis
sonare, Surgite mortui, and venite ad judicium.
wheresoever he was, whatsoever he did, whether he ate or drank, or walked
abroad, or sat in his study, or talked with any, he thought he heard the last
Trump sound shrill in his ears, Awake ye that sleep in the dust, and come to
judgment. At which time that you may be all more perfect, I would advise you
to Barradius comment. in concord Evang. Ascendat men's tribunal judici, rationem

reckon before hand with your selves, either at private fasts, or every
evening. Among Pythag. (...).
Pythagoras his golden Verses these seem to me to be most weighty: Before thou
suffer thy temples to take any rest, resolve these three questions, Wherein
have I transgressed? What have I done? What part of my duty have I left this
day undone?

(...)
(...);
According to which rule Seneca records it to the eternal praise of Sextius,
that every evening he put these interrogatories to his soul, Quod hodie malum
san^st? cu^ vitio obstitisti? qua part melior factus es?
What wound have thou healed this day? What vice have thou withstood? Wherein
art thou better than thou were the day before? thus Pythagoras advised, thus
Sextius did, and yet neither of them (for ought appears) thought of any other
judge than their reason, nor accusers than their thoughts, nor tormentors than
their vicious affections, nor hell than their own conscience. What suppose ye
would they have done? what care would they have taken? how often would they have
revised their accounts, if they had thought they should have been brought to
answer for all their actions, speeches, gestures, affections, nay thoughts,
purposes, intentions, deliberations, and resolutions, before God and his holy
Angels at the dreadful day of judgment? If the consideration of these things
no whit affect you, you shall one day give an account among other your sins for
the unprofitable hearing of this Sermon. His word which I have preached unto
you this day, shall testify against you at that day. Give me leave therefore a
little to rouse you up, and by applying the steel of my Text to your flinty
hearts, to strike out of them the fire of zeal. I told you before of four
sorts of Stewards, the sacred, the honorable, the wealthy, and the common and
ordinary. I will begin with the sacred.

1. Appl. to Ministers.
Thou to whom the Oracles of God and souls of men are committed, who have
received grace by imposition of hands, not to gain applause to thy self, or
an high step of dignity on earth; but to win souls to God, and bring men to
Heaven: thou to whom the mist of black darkness is reserved for ever, if thou
departest from the holy commandment, and drawest others after thee; but an
eminent place amongst the Stars, if thou turn many to righteousness: how is
it that thy mind, study and endeavor is not to build Gods house, but to raise
thine own; not to add by the ministry of the Gospel those to the Church that
shall be saved, but Imponere Pelion Ossae, to lay steeple upon steeple, and
preferment upon preferment, and add dignity to dignity? either not preaching
at all, or like the high Priest in the old Law, entering but once a year into
the Sanctum sanctorum, or at the most furnishing but some few high Festivals
with some rare and exquisite pieces of stuff, embroidered with variety of all
arts and sciences, save Divinity. Is this to preach Christ crucified? Is this
to John 21.16, 17.
feed, feed, and feed? is this to be 2 Timothy 4.2.
instant in season, and out of season; to reprove, rebuke, to exhort with all
long-suffering and doctrine? is this to Acts 20.27. I have not shunned to
declare unto you all the counsel of God.
declare the whole counsel of God? is this to 1 Timothy 4.13.
attend to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, to continue in them? is this
to give themselves wholly to the work of the Ministry, that their profiting
may appear unto all? is this to Acts 20.31.
warn every one publicly, and house by house, day and night with tears to
save themselves from the corruption of the world, and the snares of Satan, and
wrath to come? Will a purchased dispensation of absence from thy Cure upon some
plausible pretense, or thy Curates diligence excuse thy supine negligence, or
secure thee from the Apostles 1 Cor. 9.16.
Vae, Woe be to me Paul, if I preach not the Gospel in mine own person? O
think upon it in time to make a better reckoning before thou be summoned to
give up the last accounts in the words of my Text, Give an account of thy
Stewardship, of thy Ministry.

Next to the sacred Steward comes in the minister of State and Magistrate to
be rounded in the ear with the admonition in my Text. 2. To Magistrates.
Thou to whom both the Tables are committed, who art ordained by God, and
appointed by thy Sovereign to see religion maintained, justice executed, and
peace kept: how comes it to pass that the sword of justice lies rusty in
the scabard, and is not drawn out against Sabbath Breakers, contemners of the
Church discipline, blasphemers, swearers, drunkards, lewd and scandalous
livers? Do thou use the authority committed to thee to revenge thy self,
and not to redress wrongs done to the law? nay do thou protect and bolster
iniquity and impiety? do thou live by those sins, and draw a revenue by
licensing those places of disorder, which thou art made a minister of justice
to suppress? Is this to be a man fearing God, and hating covetousness? is
this to stop the mouth of impiety? to cleanse the sinkes of impurity? to purge
out the filth that is in the skirts of Jerusalem? to reform all abuses, and to
prevent Gods judgments upon this Realm, by punishing all the violaters of his
laws? Remember that thou who here sit upon the bench, shall one day be
called to the bar, to be tried for eternal life or death before the Judge of
all flesh, from whose face the heavens and the earth fled, and their place
could no where be found. O think in time to make a better reckoning before
thy summons to give in thy last account in the words of my Text, Give an
account, etc. viz. of thy authority and commission.

After the Ministers of the Gospel and the Magistrate, 3. To the rich and
covetous.
come the rich of this world to be admonished to look to their accounts. Thou
whom thy Master has trusted with much of his goods and coin, to beautify his
Sanctuary, to maintain them that serve at his Altar, and to stay and silence
the loud cries and deep sighs of the hungry, thirsty, naked, oppressed,
imprisoned, and captivated members of thy Redeemer; do thou bury thy money
under the ground, or lock it up in thy iron chest till it rust? Do thou
like the Gryphine in the natural story keep others from the precious metal,
whereof thy self make no use at all? Thou Cypr. de cleemos. Servas pecuniam,
quae te servata non servat, etc.
savest the money, which being saved will not save thee, and losest by keeping
it the blessing of God, the prayers of the poor, nay thine own soul, by
preferring thy Mammon, and setting it in thine own affection before thy
Savior. How can thou give an account of thy Stewardship, who have laid out
nothing for thy Masters use; who yet will certainly question thee as well pro
lucro cessante, as pro damno emergente, as well for not employing his money for
his advantage, as for that thou have employed to loss? In which regard Saint
James 5.1.
James ringeth them a sad peale after the passing bell has gone for them, Go
to now you rich men, weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon you;
your riches are corrupted, your garments moth-eaten, your gold and silver is
cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat
your flesh as it were fire.

4. To the Prodigal.
Here let not the prodigal spender vainly flatter himself, that his condition
shall be easier at the day of judgment than that of the covetous; because he
suffers not his money to rust: but rather causes it to glissen in his plate,
glare in his jewels, glitter in his apparel, shine in his gilt rooms,
cabbinets, furnitures and hangings. For all this luster shall be a clear
evidence against him of his wasting his Masters substance; and if it shall go
hard with the hard and covetous man, who lays not out his Masters money, what
may this exhauster expect? if the Miser shall suffer as a Cypr de elecmos.
Sacrilegium est rem pauperum non dare pauperibus.
sacrilegious person, because he gives not the poor their due, what
punishment is he like to endure, who robs the Church, racketh his tenants,
oppresses the poor, extorteth from, or exacteth upon all, to maintain either
his vain glorious pride, or delicate palate, or idle sports, or impure
pleasures? How many hunger and cold starved poor will have an action against
this Steward, for preferring his Hawks and Hounds before them: and riotously
expending that in one luxurious feast, which would have fed them for many
years: and laying out that in one costly suit or rich jewel, wherewith
hundreds of them might have been clothed in the bitterest winter season, and
thereby their lives preserved? how will they be ashamed and confounded at the
great audit day, to deliver in an account after this manner? In vain sports
thus much, in satisfying my lust thus much, to make ostentation of my
greatness thus much, to be revenged of my enemies thus much, for maintenance
of Gods worship not the tenth of my tenth, nay not the hundredth part of my
rapines, for the relief of the poor a trifle, in voluntary oblations nothing
at all. O think upon this in time, that you may make better reckonings before
you be summoned to give in your last accounts in the words of my Text, Give an
account of thy Stewardship, of thy wealth and worldly blessings.

5. To all men in general.
Are all dispensers of the Word and Sacraments? are all in authority? are all
commanders? have all the wealth of the world? surely no: yet all are
accountants; some for their trade and course of life, others for their natural
parts and gifts, and all for their time. Few I persuade my self can give a
good account of the first, fewer of the second, but fewest of all of the third.
It was spoken by a Heathen of the Heathen, but I fear it may be truly said of
many Christians in profession, Sen. ep. 1. ad Lucil. Magna pars vitae labitur
male agentibus, maxima nihil agentibus, tota aliud agentibus.
that they spend a great part of their life in sinful actions, the greatest in
idleness, the whole in impertinent business. The dearest loss of all is of
time: because if we have imbezelled our estate by ill husbandry, we may
repair it by thrift and industry; if we have pawned our plate, and
household stuff, and jewels, they may be redeemed again; if we have morgaged
our lands, the morgage may be satisfied, and our lands restored: but the time
that we have idly, or lewdly, or loosely spent can never be recovered. No
man need Bellerophon like spur a flying horse, time posteth of it self: yet
many men not content to let time go from them in her swiftest motions, they
drive her out, and devise how they may set her packing, and be soonest rid of
her; like the Aelian. var. hist. l. 1.
Persian King, who proposed a great reward to any that could invent any new
pastime, they highly value such companions with whom they may lavish out the
flower and best of their time. The account of these brave Gallants, and noble
Sparks, as they are termed, is soon cast. Half the night gamed and revelled,
and as much of the day slept out, and the remainder indifferently shared
between the Tavern and the Play, and the worst of the three. Neither can the
other sex give an account much better, 6. To Women.
whose day after a ramisticall dichotomy being divided into forenoone and
afternoon: the former part is usually taken up in dressing, trimming, and I
fear in that for which they have no color in holy Scriptures, nor the example
of the best times, painting; the later in idle visits, and seeking after the
fashions. They allow themselves little time for the contemplation of any thing
save their face and dresses in their glasses, nor trouble they their heads with
any thing so much as their tiring. In sum, they spend all their time in a
manner in beautifying and adorning their body to please their lovers, but in
comparison none at all in beautifying and adorning their souls to please their
Maker and Husband Christ Jesus. Of these Saint James 5.5.
James long ago gave us the character, They live in pleasure in the earth, and
wax wanton, and are fatted for the day of slaughter. I spare to rehearse other
lavishing out of time, lest the rehearsing thereof might seem worthy to be
numbered among the idle expenses thereof. And now it is time to set the foot to
the account of my meditations on this Scripture, The Conclusion.
and draw near to that which we all every day draw nearer, unto an end. The 1
Pet. 4.7.
end of all things is at hand: be sober therefore, and watch unto prayer. The
day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens
shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent
heat, the earth also and the works thereof shall be burned up. This great
Doomes-day cannot be far off, as we see by the fearful forerunners
thereof: howsoever the day of our death, which may be called little doomes-day,
will soon overtake us; peradventure before the Sun yet set, or this glass be
run. Wherefore, I beseech you all that hear me this day, in the fear of
God, by occasion of the summons in my Text, to enter into a more strict
examination of your life than ever heretofore: bring out all your thoughts,
words, deeds, projects, councels and designs, and lay them to the rule of Gods
Law; and if they swerve never so little from it, reform and amend them:
recount how you have bestowed the blessings of this life, how you have employed
the gifts of nature, how you have increased your talents of grace, wherein the
Church or Commonwealth has been the better by you; consider how you have
carried your selves abroad in the world, how at home in your private families,
but how especially in the closet of your own heart. You know out of the
Gospel, that a man's Mat. 12.44.
house may be swept and garnished, that is, his outward conversation civil and
fair, and yet harbor seven unclean spirits within. If lust, and
covetousness, and pride, and envy, and malice, and rancour, and deceit, and
hypocrisy, like so many serpents lie under the ground, gnawing at the root of
the tree, be the leaves of your profession never so broad, and seem the fruits
of your actions never so fair, the vine is the vine of Sodom, and the grape
the grape of Gomorrah. There is nothing so easy, as to put a fresh color upon
a rotten post, and to set a fair gloss upon the fowlest matters, to pretend
conscience for most unconscionable proceedings, and make religion it self a
mask to hide the deformity of most irreligious practices. But when the secrets
of all hearts shall be opened, and the intents and purposes of all our actions
manifested, and the most hidden works of darkness brought to light. As it is
to be hoped, that many that are infinitely wronged in the rash censures of
men, shall be justified in the sight of God and his Angels; so it is to be
feared, that very many whom the world justifies and canonizeth also for
Saints, shall be condemned at Christ's bar, and have their portion with
hypocrites in hell: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Wherefore
since we shall all one day come to such a public, such an impartial, such a
particular trial of all that we have done in the body, either good or evil:
let us look more narrowly to all our ways, and see that they be straight and
even.

1. Let us search our heart with all diligence, let us look into all the
corners thereof, and see there lurk no wickedness, nor filthiness, nor
hypocrisy there: let us look to our thoughts, that they be pure: to our
desires, that they be lawful: to our affections, that they be regular: to our
passions, that they be moderate: to our ends, that they be good: to our
purposes, that they be honest: to our intentions, that they be sincere: to our
resolutions, that they be well grounded and firm.

2. Next, let us take our tongue to examination, and weigh all our words in the
balance of the Sanctuary, and try whether they have not been light and idle,
but grave and profitable: not crafty and deceitful, but simple and plain: not
false and lying, but true and faithful: not outrageous, but sober: not filthy,
but modest: not profane, but holy: not censorious, but charitable: not
scurrilous, but ponderous: not insolent, but lowly and courteous: not any way
offensive and unsavory, but such as might Ephesians. 4.29.
minister grace to the hearers.

3. Lastly, let us lay our hands upon our handy works, and examine our outward
acts and deeds. 1. Whether they have been always justifiable in general by
the Law of God, that is, either commanded by it, or at least warranted in it.
2. Whether they have been and are conformable to the orders of the Church, and
laws of the Land. For we must obey lawful authority for conscience sake, in
all things that are not repugnant to the divine Law, as Bernard piously
resolves, saying, Thou must yield obedience to him as to God, who is in the
place of God, in those things that are not against God. 3. Whether they have
been agreeable to our particular calling. For some things are justifiable by
the Law of God and man in men of one state and calling, which are heinous
sins in another: as we see in the cases of Uzza and Uzziah. 4. Whether they
have been answerable to our inward purposes, intentions and dispositions. For
though they are otherwise lawful and agreeable, yet if they go against the
hair, if they are done with grudging and repining, and not heartily, they are
neither acceptable to God nor man. 5. Whether they have been (all things
considered) most expedient. For as many things are profitable and expedient
that are not lawful; so some things are lawful that are not 1 Cor. 6.12. All
things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient.
expedient: and because they are not expedient, if necessity bear them not
out, they become by consequent unlawful. For we are not only bound to eschew
all the evil we know, but also at all times to do the best good we can: else
we fulfill not the commandment of loving God with all our heart, and all our
soul, and all our strength.


To sum up all. I have discoursed unto you, first, of the Stewardship of the
things of this life: secondly, of the account of this Stewardship: thirdly, of
the time of this account. The Stewardship most large, the account most strict,
the time most uncertain. After the explication of these points, in the
application I arraigned four Stewards before you: first, the sacred: secondly,
the civil: thirdly, the wealthy: fourthly, the ordinary: and found them all
very tardy and imperfect in their accounts: which that you might not be, I but
even now delivered unto you the rule of three, or golden rule, as it is called
in sacred algebray, whereby you may easily number your days, and cast up your
accounts, and infallibly perfect the books of your conscience. What remains,
but that at your first and best opportunity you fall on this work, cast your
accounts privately in the chamber of your heart, peruse the book of your
conscience, mend what is amiss by unfeigned and hearty repentance, fetch out
all the blots and blurres there with the aqua fortis of your tears: and if yet
there remain any thing which you cannot well account for, to meet your Master
before hand upon your knees, and beseech him to put it upon his Sons score,
and to satisfy himself out of the infinite treasury of his merits, or to wipe
it out with the sponge that was offered him on the Cross? This if ye practice
daily, and make even with God every night; you shall be perfect and ready when
your Master shall call for your accounts: and you shall be found of him in
peace, and he shall then say unto you, Well done good and faithful Stewards,
ye have been faithful in a little, I will set you over much: ye have been
faithful in temporal, I will trust you with eternal goods: ye have been
faithful in earthly, I will commit to you heavenly treasures: ye have been
faithful in a Stewardship, I will give you a Kingdom: enter into your Masters
joy. Into which God grant we may all enter, when we are passed out of this vale
of tears, through the merits of Christ's death and passion, by the conduct of
his holy Spirit. To whom, three persons and one God, etc.

Chapel at the Funeral of Master Benet, Merchant. THE XXII. SERMON.
DEUTERONOMY. 32.29. O that they were wise, then they would understand this, they
would consider their later end.


Right Worshipful, etc.
HEnoch lived by just computation so many years as there are days in the
year, viz. 365. and he was the seventh man from Adam, and dyed in anno Sethus
Calvis. in Chron.
Sabbathico, the Sabbathick year, and thereby became a lively Emblem both of
this life, and the life to come. For the labors of this life are governed by
the course of the Sun, which is finished in that period of time; and the rest
of the life to come is evidently prefigured in the Sabbath. It is farther
written of him in the holy Records of eternity, that he Heb. 11.5. Genesis 5.24.
walked with God, and was therefore translated that he should not see death,
to teach us, that they who walk with God all the days of their life as he
did, shall come into no condemnation, but immediately pass from death to life,
from death temporal to life eternal, which was not obscurely disciphered unto
us in the narration of the seventh days creation. After the mention of every
day in the week, and the work thereof, we read, so the evening and the
morning were the first day, and so the Genesis 1.5, 8, 13.19, 23, 31.
second, and the rest: but after the relation of the seventh days creation, on
which God rested and blessed and sanctified it, the former clause is quite Gen
2.1, 2, 3.
omitted. It is not added as in the rest, so the morning and the evening were
the seventh day: because in Heaven, whereof the Sabbath was a type, there is no
morning and evening, much less night; but as it were perpetual high-noon. For
the Apoc. 21.23.
Lamb is the light thereof, and this Lamb is the Mal. 4.2.
Sun of righteousness, which never rises nor sets, but keeps still in
the midst of the Empyreall Heaven and Throne of God: as on the contrary, in
Hell there is nothing but continual midnight and everlasting darkness. Thus
the wisdom of God justly, and the justice of God wisely has proportioned the
rewards in the life to come to the works of men in this life: they that cast
off the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light, and walk in the
light as children of the light here, shall hereafter possess the inheritance
of the Colos. 1.12.
Saints in light; but they who love darkness more than light, and have
fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, and continually walk as
in the dark, in gross and palpable ignorance, in gluttony and drunkenness,
in chambering and wantonness, and the like sins of darkness here, shall
hereafter inhabit the region of perpetual darkness, and never vanishing
shadows of death. O that we were wise, then we would understand these things,
and in the beginning of our race in this world think of our ^^n. ep. 30. Ut
mortem nunquam time^s, semper cogita.
later end. For the beginning of wisdom is the consideration of our end; and
a forcible means to bring us to everlasting life, is to meditate continually
upon our death. To think what we shall be, stench and rottenness, and worse
if we be not better, ashes and cinders of hell, will through the power of
Christ's death make us what we should be, that is, dead to sin, dead to the
world, dead in our selves, but alive in God. How can he live in sin, who
perpetually apprehends that he shall dye eternally for his sin? how can he
make a trade of iniquity, and a sport of religion, and a mock of God, and a god
of his belly, who has hell torments always before the eyes of his mind?
Lament. 1.9.
Jerusalem remembered not her last end; therefore she came down fearfully: and
because we put from us the evil day, it comes fast upon us. It were
unpossible to go on forward as we do in the ways of sin and paths of
death, if we would dwell but a little while upon these or the like thoughts:
After a few days, perhaps this very day, yea this hour, I shall be called to
a strict account of my whole life, charged with all the sins open and secret
that ever I have committed, accused by the Devil, convicted by mine own
conscience, condemned by the dreadful Judge of quick and dead, to be cast
into utter darkness in hell, there to endure such torments for ever, as it
would break the strongest heart, and conquer all humane patience to feel but
for an hour. Haec cogitare est vitiis omnibus renunciare, to enter into a
serious consideration of these things, is to chase away all wanton and wicked
thoughts and to send a bill of divorce to the world and all her minions, the
mistresses of our carnal affections: but this is the mischief, as S. Cyp. de
mortal. Aeterna tormenta nemo cogitat, quae metueret conscientia si crederet,
si metueret caveret, si caveret evaderet.
Cyprian pricking the right vein tells us, it is a thing to be bewailed with
tears of blood, that none almost minds everlasting torments. For did they
mind them and believe them, they could not but fear them, and if they feared
them ^^^y would beware of them; and if they would beware of them, they might
escape them. O that men therefore were wise, to think upon hell before they
rushed on the brinke of it, and enter into a serious consideration of Gods
fearful judgments upon obstinate and impenitent sinners before they were
overtaken by them. This is the scope and effect of these words, and I pray God
they may work this effect in us, that laying before our eyes the fearful ends
of the wicked, and their damnation, we may learn from henceforth to be wise
unto salvation.

The unum necessarium and chief point of all to be thought upon in this life
is, what shall become of us after we go from hence: for here (God knows) we
have but a short time to stay. We read in King Eccles. 3.1.2.
Solomon's distribution of time, according to the several occasions of man's
life, to every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the
heaven, a time to be borne, and a time to dye: but we read of no time to
live, as if our death bordered upon our birth, and our cradle stood in our
grave; yet upon this moment rather than time of our life depends eternity.

Division.
The greatest perfection attainable by man in this life is wisdom, and the
most proper act of wisdom is consideration, and the chiefest point of
consideration is our later end. First therefore the Spirit of God in this Text
commends wisdom to their desires. Secondly, consideration to their
wisdom. Thirdly, their later end to their consideration: and the more to
stir up their affections and express his, he delivers this his advice in a
wish, and accompanies it with a deep sigh, saying, O that they were wise, they
would understand this, that it is not for their sakes that they might brag,
but for their enemies sake that they might not brag, that I have thus long
spared them. For I had long ere this scattered them abroad, and made their
remembrance cease from amongst men, but that I knew their adversaries would
take advantage thereat, and wax proud upon it, Verse 27.
and say our high hand, and not the Lord has done it. For they are a Nation
void of council, neither is there any understanding in them. Which words bear
a light before the words of my Text, Coherence.
and thus bring them in: O that they were wise, then they would understand
this, viz. that nothing stands between them and my wrath, my wrath and their
destruction, but the pride of their enemies: they are indebted to the fury,
malice, and insolency of the Heathen, who seek utterly to destroy them, and by
proudly treading upon their necks, to trample true religion under feet, that
hell raines not down upon them from heaven, and they not burnt like Sodom,
and consumed like Gomorrah. Were they wise, they would understand it, and
understanding consider how near they are to their end, and considering it meet
the Lord upon their knees, to prevent their utter overthrow.

Observe. 1.
O that they were so wise. If those words wherewith Moses begins his
Swan-like song immediately before his death, Verse 2.
My doctrine shall drop as the rain, and my speech shall distill as the dew,
as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass,
were verified of any of his words, they are certainly of these in my Text,
which drop like rain, or rather like ho^y from his mouth: whereby we may
taste how sweet the Lord is in his speeches, how mild in his proceedings, how
passionate in his persuasions, what force of art and eloquence he uses to draw
us unto him, without force and violence. Are not sighs the very breath of
love? are not sobs the accents of grief? are not groans fetched deep the long
periods of sorrows ravishing eloquence? which Almighty God breathes out of the
boiling heat of his affection both here and elsewhere: O Hos. 6.4.
Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, how shall I entreat thee? for
your righteousness is as a morning cloud, and your goodness as an earthly dew
vanishes away. O that Psalm. 81.13, 14, 15, 16.
my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways. I should
soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him: but their
time should have endured for ever. He should have fed them with the finest of
the wheat, and with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied thee. And, O
Mat. 23.37.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest those that are
sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen
does gather her chickens under her wings, but ye would not? How can the
affection more outwardly enlarge, or the heart open it self, than by opening
the bosom, and stretching out the arms to embrace? Behold the Esaias 65.2.
arms of Almighty God stretched all the day long to a rebellious people, which
walks in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts. What truer
Ambassadors of a bleeding heart than weeping eyes? behold the tears of our
Savior over Jerusalem, and reach your hand, and thrust it into the hole of his
side, and you shall feel drops from his heart bleeding afresh for your
ungrateful refusal of his love, and despite of his grace. If drops of rain
pierce the stones, and drops of warm Goats blood crumble the Adamant into
pieces; shall not Christ's tears sink into our affections, and the drops of
his heart blood break our hearts with godly sorrow, and make them so thorougly
contrite by unfeigned repentance, that they may be an acceptable sacrifice unto
him? according to the words of the Psalmist, Psalm. 51.17.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O
God, thou shall not despise. Were not that City very unwise, that would refuse
any tolerable conditions of peace offered by a potent enemy, against wh^m she
could not make her party good in war? Beloved, are we able to hold out war
with Almighty God? to maintain a fight against his plagues and judgments?
what are we but dead men, if he lay hold on his glittering sword? why then do
we not come in whilst he holds out his golden Scepter of mercy? why sue
we not to him for a treaty of peace? It can be no disparagement to us to
seek to him first; yet we need not, he seeks to us first, he makes an
overture of his desire for peace, he draws conditions with his own hand, and
offers them to us, as we heard before out of the 81. Psalm, If Israel would
have walked in my ways, etc. that is, if you will yield to me, and
acknowledge me for your Lord, and accept of my laws, I will take the
protection of you against all your bodily and ghostly enemies, I will secure
you from all danger, enrich you with grace, give you all the contentment you
desire upon earth, and prefer you to a crown of glory in heaven. Can you
desire fairer conditions than these? know ye who it is that tendereth them? he
is your Lord and Maker, who need not condition with you; that which he meekly
craves he could powerfully force you unto; he sueth for that by entreaty,
which he may challenge by right; all that he requires on our part is but our
bounden duty, and his desire is that we should bind him to us for doing that
service which we are bound to do. Was there ever such a creditour heard of,
that would come in bonds for his own debt, and become a debtour to his
debtour? Saint Aug l 5. confess. c. 9. Dignaris quoniam in seculum misericordia
tua est iis quibus omnia debita dimittis promissionibus tuis debtor fieri.
Austin could not hold when he fell upon this meditation, but breaks out into
a passion, Thou vouchsafest, O Lord, by thy promises to become debtour to them,
to whom thou remittest all debts. What happiness! what honor is it to have
Almighty God come in bonds to us? I beseech you think what they deserve who
set light by so great a favor, and refuse such love.

Application.
Now God makes as it were love to us, and in doleful Sonnets complains of our
unkindnesse, O that my people would have hearkened to my voice, etc. To which
his amorous expostulations if we now turn a deaf ear, the time will come
when we shall take up the words of God in our own persons, and with hearts
grief and sorrow say, O that we had hearkened to the Lord, O that we had
walked in his ways; then should we have seen the felicity of his chosen, and
rejoiced with the joy of his people, and gloried with his inheritance: but now
we behold nothing but the misery of his enemies, and are confounded with the
shame of reprobates, and suffer the torments of the damned, and shall till we
have satisfied to the utmost farthing. Now God wooeth us with deepest
protestations of love, and largest promises of celestial graces, which if we
make light of, it will one day fall heavy upon us. The sweetest wine
corrupts into the sharpest vinegar, and the most fragrant ointments, if they
putrefie, exhale most pestilent savours; and greatest love, if it be wronged,
turns into the greatest hatred. Now God as a lover passionately wooeth us,
but if we sleighten him, and despise his kind offers, he will change his
note, and turn his woo into a woe, as we hear, Hos. 7.13.
Woe be unto them, for they have fled away from me; destruction shall be unto
them, because they have rebelled against me: though I have redeemed them, yet
they have spoken lies against me. After the clearest flash of lightening
follows the terriblest clap of thunder: in like manner after Gods mercy in
Scripture has for a long time lightened, and most clearly showed it self to
any people or nation, his justice thundereth out most dreadful threats. For
example: after Gods familiar disputation with his Vineyard, Esaias 5.1, 2, 3, 4.
My beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill, and he fenced it, and
gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and
built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he
looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge I pray you between
me and my Vineyard, what could I have done more to my Vineyard that I have not
done? etc. mark the fearful conclusion (Verse 5.) I will tell you what I will
do to my Vineyard, I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall he eaten
up, I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And
what ensued upon our Saviors tears over Jerusalem, which would not sink into
their stony hearts, but the bloody tragedy which was acted upon them 40. years
after by the Romans? who spared neither the anointed head of the Priest, nor
the hoary head of the aged, nor the weaker sex of women, nor the tender age of
infants; but put all to the sword, sacked the walls, rifled the houses, burned
the Temple down to the ground, and left not one stone upon another. O that we
were wise, then we would understand, and observe the method of Gods
proceedings, and in the ruin of Gods people, if we repent not, consider our
later end. O that they were

Wise. The Philosophers distinguish wisdom into (...), Prudence.


Sapience they define to be the knowledge of all divine and humane things, so
far as they fall within the scantling of man's reason.

Prudence they restrain to the ordering of humane affairs: and this they
divide into 1. Private, 2. Public: and this they subdivide into 1. Civil, 2.
Military.

Military prudence makes a wise soldier, civil a wise statesman, domesticke
a wise householder, and sapience a wise contemplative, and moral prudence in
general a wise practick man. The rules of this wisdom are to be taken from
the precepts of Philosophy, discourses of Policy, the apophthegmes and
stratagems, sentences and examples of those whom the world has cried up for
Sages; but this is not the wisdom which Moses here requires in Gods people,
and passionately complains of the want of it: but a wisdom of a higher
nature, or, to speak more properly, a wisdom above nature, a wisdom which
descends from the Father of lights, which directs us so to order and
govern our short life here, that thereby we may gain eternity hereafter: so
to worship and serve God in Christ in this world, that we may reign with him
in the world to come. The infallible rules of this wisdom are to be fetched
only from the inspired Oracles of God extant in the Old and New Testament: the
chief whereof are these;

1. To receive and entertain the doctrine of salvation, Rules of spiritual
wisdom.
which is the wisdom of God in a mystery, confuting the errors, and
convincing the folly of all worldly wise men.

2. To deny our selves, and our carnal wisdom and reason, and bring every
thought in obedience to the Gospel.

3. To account our selves strangers and pilgrims here upon earth, and so to
use this world as though we used it not.

4. To know, that we are not Lords of our lands, wealth and goods, but only
Stewards, to account for them: and therefore so to dispense and distribute
them, that we make friends of unrighteous Mammon, that when it fails us, they
may receive us into everlasting habitations.

5. To seek the Lord whilst he may be found, and not to defer our
repentance from day to day.

6. To be sure to provide for our eternal state, whatsoever becomes of our
temporal; and to prefer the salvation of our soul before the gaining of the
whole world.

7. To examine daily our spiritual estate, and to inform our selves truly how
we stand in the Court of Heaven, in Gods favor, or out of it.

8. To observe to what sins we are most subject; and where we are weakest,
there continually to fortify against Satan's batteries.

9. In all weighty occasions, especially such as concern our spiritual
estate, to ask counsel of God, and take direction from his Word.

10. To consider the special works of Gods providence in the carriage of the
affairs of this world, and make use thereof to our selves.

11. Lastly, to meditate upon the Law of God all the days of our life, and
consider their blessed end that keep it with their whole heart; and their
accursed death that transgress it. And so I fall upon the second branch of my
Text:

They would consider. I have already proposed wisdom to your desires: now I
am to commend consideration to your wisdom. The School Divines make this the
special difference between the knowledge of men and Angels, that the knowledge
of Angels is intuitive, but of men discursive: they see all things to which the
beam of their sight extends, as it were on the sudden with one cast of the
eye; but we by degrees see one thing after another, and infer effects from
causes, and conclusions from principles, and particulars from generals: they
have the treasures of wisdom and knowledge ready always at hand; we by
reading, hearing, conference, but especially by meditation must dig it out of
the precious mines where it lies. In which regard Barradius, alluding to the
sound of the word though not to the Grammatical original, says, meditatio
est quasi mentis ditatio, meditation is the enriching of the soul, because it
delves into the rich mines of wisdom, and makes use of all that we hear or
read, and lays it up in our memories. Seneca fitly terms it rumination, or
chewing of the cud, which makes the food of the soul taste sweeter in the
mouth, and digest better in the stomach. By the Law of God the Levit. 11.3, 7.
beasts that chewed not the cud were reckoned among the unclean, of which the
people of God might not eat: such are they in the Church, that never ruminate,
or meditate upon those things they take in at the ear, which is the souls
mouth. I know no difference more apparent between a wise man and a fool than
this, that the one is prometheus, he advises before; the other is epimetheus,
he acts first, and deliberateth afterward, and Hesiod. (...).
wardeth after he has received the wound: the one does all things headily and
rashly; the other maturely and advisedly. A man that has an understanding
spirit, calls all his thoughts together, and holds a cabinet council in
the closet of his heart, and there propounds, debateth, deliberateth and
resolves what he has to do, and how, before he imbarke himself into any
great design, or weighty affair. For want of this preconsideration most men
commit many errors, and fall into great inconveniences, troubles and
mischiefs, and are often caught unawares in the Devils snare; which they might
easily have shunned, if they had looked before they leaped, and fore-casted
their course before they entered into it. It is a lamentable thing to see how
many men, partly through carelessness and incogitancie, partly through a desire
to enjoy their sensual pleasures without any interruption, suffer Satan like
a cunning Faulkner to put a hood upon their souls, and therewith blind the
eyes of the understanding; and never offer to pluck it off, or stir it,
before he has brought them to utter darkness.

O that men were wise to understand this cunning of the Devil, Application.
and consider always what they do before they do it: and be they never so
resolutely bent, and hot set upon any business, yet according to the advice of
the Cic. Orat. pro Pub. Quint. Si haec duo solum verba tecum habuisses, Quid
ago? respirasset credo cupiditas, etc.
Orator, to give their desires so long a breathing time, till they have spoken
these two words to themselves, Quid agimus? what do we? what are we about? is
it a commendable work? is it agreeable to the Word of God? and suitable to our
calling? is it of good report? and all circumstances considered expedient? if
so, go on in Gods name, and the Lord prosper your handy-workes: but if
otherwise, meddle not with it, and put off all that the Devil or carnal
wisdom can allege to induce you unto it, with these checkes of your own
consciences, saying to your selves, Shall we offend God? shall we charge our
consciences? shall we stain our reputation? shall we scandalize our
profession? shall we despite the Spirit of grace? shall we forfeit our estate
in Gods promises, and foregoe a title to a Kingdom? shall we pull down all
Gods plagues and judgments upon us in this life, and hazard the damnation of
body and soul in hell; and all this for an earthly vanity, a fading commodity,
a momentary pleasure, an opinion of honor, a thought of contentment, a dream
of happiness? Shall we bett with the Devil, and stake our souls against a
trifle? shall we venture our life, and put all the treasures of Gods grace, and
our crown of glory in the Devils bottom, for such light and vile merchandise
as this world affords? Is it not folly, nay madness to lay out all upon one
great feast, knowing that we should fast all the year after? to venture the
boiling in the river of brimstone for ever, for bathing our selves in the
pleasures of sin for an hour?

We forbid our children to eat fruit, because we say it breeds worms in
their bellies: and if we had the like care of the health of our souls, as of
their bodies, we would for the same reason abstain from the forbidden fruit
of sin, because it breeds in the conscience a never dying worm. O that we
were wise to understand this, and to

Consider our later end. I have proposed wisdom to your desires in the first
place; and in the second referred consideration to your wisdom: now in the
last place I am to recommend your later end to your consideration. A wise man
begins with the end, which is first in the intention, but last in the
execution: and as we judge of stuffes by their last, so of all courses by their
end to which they tend. It is not the first or middle, but the last scene that
denominateth the play a tragedy or a comedy: and it is the state of a man at
his death and after, upon which we are to pass judgment, whether he be happy
or miserable. No man knows who has gotten honor or infamy, till the race is
run; but after the course is finished, when the rewards are distributed to
every man according to his work, when they that have kept within the ways of
God, and held on straight to the price of their high calling, receive an
incorruptible crown of glory: but they who have turned out of the right way to
pursue earthly vanities, receive their wages, eternal death; then all men
shall see who was the wiser of the two, and took the better course: then the
wicked themselves shall confess their beastly folly, thus rubbing upon their
own sores, and fretting their own wounds, as we read in the book of
Wisdom; And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say
within themselves, Wisd. 5.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
This was he whom we had sometimes in derision, and a Proverb of reproach. We
fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honor. How is
he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the Saints?
Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness
has not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us. We
wearied our selves in the way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone
through deserts, where there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord, we
have not known it. What has pride profited us? or what good has riches with
our vaunting brought us? All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as
a Post that hasted by. And as a ship that passes over the waves of the water,
which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found: neither the
pathway of the keele in the waves. Where is now our gay and gorgeous
apparel? where are our sumptuous hangings? our rich cubboard of plate? our
gold and silver? where are our orient pearls? our blushing rubies? our glowing
carbuncles? our sparkling diamonds? our beautiful damsels? our pompous shows?
our various delights and pastimes? our riotous banquets? our effeminate songs?
our melodious music? our lascivious dancing? our amorous imbracings? All
these things are vanished like shadows; but our sorrows come upon us thick
and threefold: all our joys, delights and comforts are withered at the root;
but our terrors, hearts grief and torments grow on us more and more, and
shall till time shall be no more. Application.
If these piteous complaints and hideous shrikes of the damned in hell move us
not, I tremble to speak it, they shall be one day ours: then with anguish of
heart and bitterness of soul we shall sigh and say, O that we had been wise,
then we would have understood these things, and in time considered of our
later end.

quatuor novissima, the four last things: 1. Death, most certain. 2.
Judgment, most strict. 3. Hell, most dreadful. 4. Paradise, most delightful.


O Death, how bitter is thy remembrance to him that is in the prime of his
pleasures, and pride of his fortune? yet the remembrance of judgment is more
bitter than of death, of hell than of judgment: death in comparison were no
death, if judgment followed not after; and judgment were no judgment, or
nothing so dreadful, if immediately upon it hell were not opened; and hell
were not hell, if it deprived us not of the pleasures of Paradise for ever. O
that men were wise to consider in the beginning, or at least before it be too
late, what their later end shall be; first to dye, then to be brought to
judgment, and after sentence, Application.

for evermore, or to be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone with the Devil
and his angels, and all the reprobate and damned, the Apoc. 14.11.
smoke of whose torment ascends up for ever and ever, and they have no rest
day nor night.

Ashes keep fire alive, and the consideration of our end and dissolution,
which shall be into dust and ashes, not only keeps alive, but also stirs
up the sparks of Gods grace in us after this manner: Why do I thus torment my
self with projects, cares, and designs? I shall shortly (I know not how soon)
return to my earth, and then all my Psalm. 146.1.
thoughts shall perish. Why do I bear my head so high now? it shall lie low
enough one day. Why do I lay on so much cost on gorgeous apparel, which
covers nothing but dust and dung? Why do I prodigally lavish out my
patrimony in exquisite dainties, and all kinds of delicious meats, which feed
nothing but worms? Why dote I upon the fairest beauty flesh and blood can
present to a lascivious eye? if it be artificial, it is nothing but paint and
powder; if natural, nothing but dust and ashes. Why do I send to the
uttermost parts of the earth for the rarest stuffes, the finest linen and
napery? I shall carry nothing of it all away with me but my winding sheet.
Lastly, why do I make so great purchases of lands and possessions? I shall
keep the possession of nothing but the measure of my grave, and perhaps be
disturbed in it too, as two of the greatest purchasers of land in the world
were. William the Norman, who conquered a great part of this Island, and
Alexander the great, who conquered the greatest part of the known world, both
lay a long time above ground unburied, being denied that which the poorest
beggar that never had foot of land in all his life has freely given unto him,
a hole to lay his head in under ground. Verily, as nothing can quench the
burning slime of Samosaris called Plin. not. hist. l. 2. c. 104. Limum
flagrantem (quam Maltham vocant^) tetra tantum extingui docuere experimenta.
Flagrat mons Chimaera immortali flamma, extinguitur tamen terra and fimo.
Maltha, nor the flame of the hill Chimaera, but only earth; so nothing can
extinguish the ever burning desires of the ambitious for honor, of the
voluptuous for pleasure, of the covetous for gain, but only mold and earth,
the complements of our grave, and remains of our later end.

In my discourse of our later end, to draw toward an end, before the
destruction of the holy City and Temple, Josephus writes of a man afflicted in
mind, that ran about the City crying, Woe to the City, woe to the Temple, woe to
the Priests, woe to the people, and last of all woe to my self; at which words
he was slain on the walls by a stone out of a sling. Let us take away but one
letter, turning woe in O, and his prophecy for the future may be our
admonition, and the application of this observation for the present. O that the
world, O that this Kingdom in the world, O that this City in this Kingdom, O
that we in this City here present were wise, then would we understand this:
this spectacle of our nature, this emblem of our frailty, this mirror of our
mortality, Applicat. ad defunct.
and in it consider our later end, which cannot be far off. For our deceased
brother is here arrested before our eyes for a debt of nature, in which we are
as deeply engaged as he; and if either the wealth of the world, or gifts of
nature, or jewels of grace might have redeemed him; if either skill of
Physicians, or love and care of his friends, or prayers and tears of his
kindred, and his dearest second self could have bayled him, he had not been
laid up as now you see him. But let no man sell you smoke to daz^ your eyes in
such sort, but that you may all see your own faces in thi^ broken glass.
There is no protection to be got from King or Nobles i^ this case: no rescuing
any by force from this Sergeant of God, death: a^^ bail or mainprise from this
common prison of all mankind, the grave: all our comfort is, that we may
hereafter sue out an habeas corpus, which the Judge of all flesh will not deny
us at the general Assizes, that we may make our corporal appearance at his
bar in the clouds, and there have our cause tried. Do you desire to know how
this debt with infinite arrerages grows upon us and all mankind? Saint
Austin gives you a good account, the woman took up sin from the Serpent, as
it were by loan, consensu Adam fecit cautionem, usura crevit posteritati, Adam
by consenting sealed the band, the interest has run upon all his posterity,
and the interest that death had in him by sin, and upon us by him, and the
interest upon interest by numberless actual sins eats us out one by one,
till death that swalloweth us up all in the end be swallowed up into 1 Cor.
15.15.
victory: and then shall be fulfilled that prophecy, O death, where is thy
sting? O grave, where is thy victory? At which Goale-delivery of all deaths
prisoners, we that are living shall not prevent our brother that lies asleep
before us in his winding sheet: upon whose hearse after I have strowed a few
flowers, I will commit him to the earth, and you to God.

1. The first flower is a Rose, the emblem of charity. For a Rose is hot in
nature, it spreads it self abroad, and after it is full blown shattereth
both leaves and seeds; so charity is hot in the affection, spreads it self
abroad by compassion, and scatters seeds by almsdeeds. Our deceased
brother, like a provence or double Rose (for God doubled the blessings of this
life upon him) spread himself abroad every way by largess, and shed seeds
plentifully, but withal so secretly, that his left hand knew not what his
right hand did: his Legacies by his death were not great, because his will was
in this kind to be his own executor by his life time.

2. The second flower is the Lilly, the emblem of purity and chastity. For the
Lilly is perfect white in color, and cold in operation, and thereby
represents pure chastity, which cools the heat of lust: this flower he kept
unblasted in the time and place of most danger, in the prime of his youth, and
in his travels beyond the sea, where he chose his consort out of pure love;
and ever loved his choice with a constant and loyal affection unto death.

3. The third flower is the Violet, the emblem of humility. For the Violet is
little, as the humble is in his own eyes, and grows near the ground, from
whence the humble takes his name, humilis ab humo, and of all other flowers it
yields the sweetest savor, as humility does in the nostrils of God and man.
Of his humility he gave good proof in his lovely and lowly carriage toward
all, in his refusing places of eminency, in renouncing all confidence in his
own merits at his death, and forbidding that a Trumpet should be blown
before his works of piety or charity. Wherefore I must be silent of the dead
by the command of the dead, with whose Christian and happy end I will conclude.
I was the happiness of Homer to be borne in Rhodes, (...), rosa. (...), viola.
a place ta^^^g the name from Roses, and to be buried in Chios taking the name
^^^m Violets: this was the happiness of our brother, who was borne and buried
in the garden of Christ's Spouse, where he drew in his first, and let out his
last breath in the sincere profession of the Gospel, which is the savor of
life unto life: which happiness God grant unto us all for his Son Jesus Christ
his sake. To whom, etc.

THe Caussin. parab. hist. Ceraunias in locis fulmine tactis invenitur.
Naturalists write of a precious stone called Ceraunias, that it is found only
in a day of thunder, glistering when the sky is overcast with darkness. With
these gems the Spouse of Christ is adorned, whose faith, constancy and patience
shine most brightly in time of adversity and persecution, when all the earth is
full of darkness and cruel habitations. As Plin. not. hist. l. 2. In
Troglodytis fons solis circa me^idiem maxim frigidus, mox paulatim tepescens;
ad noctis medium ferventissimus est. c. 103.
the fountain of the sun in the country of the Troglodytes is cold or
lukewarm at midday, but most extreme hot at midnight; such is the nature of
zeal: in the day of prosperity, and high noone of temporal glory it is cold,
or at the best lukewarm: but in the night of adversity, and dead time of
persecution it is most fervent and flagrant. Then the sincere professors open
their hearts most freely in prayer to God, and their bowels of Christian
charity and compassion to their afflicted brethren: the fear of their enemies
husheth their private differences: their loss of goods and lands is an
inducement to them to contemn the world, and (as having little or no comfort
in this life) to set their hearts wholly upon Heaven. On the contrary, peace
usually breeds carnal security, abundance luxury, wealth pride, honor
ambition, power oppression, pleasure sensuality, and earthly contentments
worldliness the bane of Religion. In which consideration especially we may
conceive it is, that our blessed Lord the Husband of the Church, who loves her
more than all the world besides (which he preserves only for her sake) yet
seldom crowns her in this world with worldly happiness and eminent
greatness; but exercises her now under the cross, as he did under the
bondage of Egypt; and captivity of Babylon before his coming into the flesh;
and after his death, first under the fury of the Heathen, next the cruelty of
the Arrian Emperors, and since that, under the insolency of the Turk in the
East, and tyranny of Antichrist in the West. As he is termed by the Prophet
Esaias, Vir dolorum, a man of sorrows; so we find her Uxorem lachrymarum, a
wife of tears; as he was crowned with thorns, so she lies in the briars: as
he was laid in wait for at his birth, so she at her new birth: as he fled from
Herod into Egypt, so she from the Dragon into the wilderness: as he was
tempted once, so she is always: as he bare his cross to Golgotha, so she has
borne hers in all parts and ages of the world. Indeed sometimes she has had
lucida intervalla, times of lightsomenesse and joy, when Kings have been her
nursing fathers, and Queens her nursing mothers: but for the most part she
sits in darkness, as a close mourner, yet solacing her self with Micah
7.8. Rejoice not against me, O my enemy: When I fall I shall rise, when I sit
in darkness the Lord shall be light unto me.
hope of better times. Hence it is, that all the pictures that are drawn of
her in Scripture, are either taken from a Apoc. 12.13.

Scripture clad in three suits of apparel different in color: 1. Black. 2.

Black is their mourning weed. Red their military ornament. White their

Their red and black vests do not so much cover their bodies, as discover
their state and condition in this world; where they always either stand, and
fight with their bodily and ghostly enemies, or sit down and Job 7.1.

continual warfare upon earth; three potent enemies continually bid them
battle: 1 The World, Without. 2 The Flesh, Within. 3 The Devil, Both within
and without.


The Devil never cease to suggest wicked thoughts, the World to present
dangerous baits, the Flesh to engender noisome lusts. The Devil mainly
assaulteth their faith, the World their hope, the Flesh their love: and they
fight with three special weapons; 1 Temptations. 2 Heresies. 3 Persecutions.


Temptations I call all vicious provocations: heresies, all false doctrines in
matter of faith and salvation: persecutions all outward afflictions.
Temptations properly lay at the will, heresies at the understanding,
persecutions at the whole person: which though the Church of Christ for the
most part in her noble members courageously endures, and therefore is fitly
compared to the Pyrausts, which are nourished in the fire; and to the Phoenix,
because she rises again out of the ashes of the burnt bodies of Martyrs: yet
sometimes, especially in her weak and more feeble members, to escape this fire
she flies into some wilderness, or remote or obscure place, where God always
provideth for her.

Division.
And the woman, there is the frailty of her nature; fled, there is the
uncertainty of her state; into the wilderness, there is the place of her
retiredness; where she is nourished by God, there is the staff of her
comfort; a thousand two hundred and threescore days, there is the term of her
obscurity, and the period of all her troubles.

And the woman, etc. Though all the prophecies of this book are darkened with
much obscurity, yet by illustrating the vision set down through this whole
chapter, and hanging it, as it were a great light, in the most eminent part of
it, we shall easily discover what divine truth lies hid in every corner
thereof. The holy Apostle, and the Evangelist S. John, in a divine rapture saw
a most fair and glorious woman in travel, and an ugly red Dragon with seven
heads and ten horns, standing before her with open mouth, ready to devour her
child; of which she was no sooner delivered, but her son was taken up to the
Throne of God, and she carried with the wings of an Eagle into the Wilderness:
the Dragon thus deceived of his prey, after which his mouth watered, cast out
of his mouth water as a flood after her to drown her. Such was the vision;
mark now, I beseech you, the interpretation thereof. By the woman all that
have dived deep into the profound mysteries of this book understand the
Church, whose beauty and glory is Ver. 1. There appeared a great wonder in
heaven, a woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet: and upon
her head a crown of twelve stars.
illustrated by the Sun clothing her, and the Moon supporting her, and the
Stars crowning her. The Sun either signifies the knowledge of Gods Word,
which enlighteneth the Church throughout; or Christ the Sun of
righteousness, who clothes her with the robes of his righteousness, Mal. 4 2.
and exalts her to his throne of glory above the Moon, on which she
stands; and thereby shows her contempt of this uncertain and mutable
world, ruled by the Moon, and subject to as many changes as that planet. Thus
it seems clear what is meant by the Sun and Moon; but what shall we make
of the crown of twelve stars set upon her head? It seems to represent
either the number of the twelve Patriarchs the Crown of the Jewish, or the
twelve Apostles the Crown of the Christian Church. The man child which this
woman had no sooner brought forth, but he was caught up unto God in his Throne,
Ver. 5.
and was to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, is undoubtedly our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ; as by comparing the fifth verse of this chapter with Psalm.
2. v. 9. and Apoc. 2.27. and 19.15. appears most evidently. As for the
Dragon, he is so set out in his colors, v. 9. that any may know him: there he
is called the old Serpent, the Devil and Satan, which deceives the whole
world. The waters which he casts out of his mouth, are multitudes of people
which he stirs up to persecute the Church. He is described with seven heads
and ten horns, like to the woman, whereby the Roman Empire or Church is meant,
called Babylon, the Mother of fornications, and abominations on the earth, ver.
5. because the Dragon employed the seven heads, and ten horns, Apoc. 17, 3.5.
that is, the policy and strength of the Roman State especially, to suppress
the true Religion, and overthrow the Church. Other Kingdoms and States have
been stained with the blood of Christians, but Rome is that Whore of Babylon,
which has died her garments scarlet red with the blood of Saints and Martyrs
of Jesus Christ: others have licked or tasted thereof, but she, in regard of
her barbarous cruelty in this kind, is said to be Apoc. 17.6.
drunk with their blood.

The vision thus cleared, the meaning of my text, and the special points of
observation in each word therein may easily be discerned. The first (...), the
woman figureth unto us the Church her 1 Original. 2 Fruitfulness. 3
Tenderness. 4 Weakness. 5 Frailty.


1 First her Original. As the first Adam being cast into a slumber, the woman
was formed of a rib taken out of his side; so when the second Adam fell into a
dead sleep on the Cross, his side was opened, and thence issued this woman
here in my text, Christ's dearest Spouse.

2 Her fruitfulness. The honor of women is their childbearing. For therefore
was Heva called the mother of the living, because all save Adam came from her:
such is the Church, a most indulgent and fruitful mother; Heva matter
viventium, the mother of all that live by faith. And as St. Cypr de unit.
Eccles. Deum non habet patrem, qui ecclesiam non habet matrem.
Cyprian concluded against all the Schismatikes in his time, we may resolve
against all the Separatists in our days; they cannot have God to their Father,
who acknowledge not the Church for their Mother.

3 Her tenderness. Mulier, says Varro, quasi mollior, women take their name
in latin from tenderness or softness, because they are usually of a softer
temper than men, and much more subject to passions, especially of fear,
grief, love, and longing: their fear is almost perpetual, their grief
immoderate, their love ardent, and their longing most vehement: such is the
temper of the militant Church, in fear always, weeping continually for her
children, never out of trouble in one place or other, sick for love of her
husband Christ Jesus, and ever longing for his second coming.

4 Her weakness or impotencie. Women are the weaker 1 Pet. 3.7. Giving honor
to the wife as to the weaker vessel.
vessels, they have no strength in comparison of men; they are able to make
small or no resistance: and in this also the militant Church resembles a
woman; for howsoever she be always strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
might, and albeit for a short time, when she had Kings and Princes for her
Champions, as in the days of David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and other Kings
of Judah: and in the reign of Constantine, Theodosius, Martianus, Justinian,
and other Emperors of Rome, by the temporal sword she put her enemies to the
worst, and had a great hand over them: yet in other ages, as well before
Christ's incarnation as after, she has bin destitute of the arm of flesh, and
has had no other than women's weapons to defend her self, viz. prayers and
tears. These alone St. Ambrose took up for his defense against the Arrian
Emperor; Amb. ep. 33. R gamus Auguste, non pugnamus.
We bow down before thee, we rise not up against thee, our dread Lord. For my
own part I can sorrow, I can sigh, I can weep; by other means I neither may
nor can resist.

5 Her frailty. Women are not only weaker in body than men, and less able to
resist violence; but also weaker in mind, and less able to hold out in
temptations: and therefore the Devil first set upon the woman, as conceiving
it a matter of more facility to supplant her than the man. I would the
militant Church were not in this also too like the weaker sex. Fair she is I
grant, but Cant. 6.10.
fair as the Moon, in which there are dark and black spots: Origin in Cant.
hom^ an illa verba Nig^a s^^. Nigra est sponsa, pulchra tamen inter mulicres
ita ut habeat aliquid Aethiopici candoris.
Or, as St. Origin notes, pulchra inter mulieres, not perfectly fair, but
fair among women: her brightest colors are somewhat stained, her graces
clouded, her beauty Sunburned. Let the Pelagians and Papists stand never so
much upon the perfection of inherent righteousness, they shall never be able
to wash clean the Esaias 64 6. We are all as an unclean thing, and all our
righteousness is as filthy rags.
menstruous cloutes, and filthy rags the Prophet Esaias speaks of. St.
Austin, who was more inward to the servants of God in his time, and better
acquainted with their thoughts than any Heretics could be, tells us, that if
all the Saints from the beginning of the world were together upon earth, and
should join in one prayer, it would be this or the like, Lord enter not into
judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
Nothing is so easy as to slip whilst we walk upon a Apoc 15 2. And I saw as
it were a^ea of glass mingled with fire.
sea of glass. For this reason it is that our Savior teaches us to pray,
Mat. 6.13.
lead us not into temptation; because there is not any temptation so weak,
that puts not our frailty to the worse: and albeit it overcome not our
faith, yet it makes our sinews so shrink (as Jacobs did after he wrestled
with the Angel) that by it we are lamed in holy duties. All those usual
similitudes whereby the Scripture sets the Church militant before our eyes,
show her frailty and imbecilitie. She is a vine, a lilly, a dove, a flock of
sheep in the midst of ravening wolves. What tree so subject to take hurt as a
vine, which is so weak, that it needs continual binding and supporting; so
tender, that if it be pricked deep, it bleedeth to death? No flower so soft and
without all defense or shelter as a lilly; no foul so harmless as the dove
that has no gallat all; no cattle so often in danger as sheep and lambs in the
midst of wolves. Yet neither the weak vine, nor the soft lilly, nor the
fearful dove, nor the harmless sheep, so lively expresses the infirmity
and danger of the wayfaring or rather warfaring Church, as the traveling woman
in this vision. What more pitiful object or lamentable spectacle can present
it self to our eyes, than a woman great with child, scared with a fiery
serpent ready to devour her child, and driven to fly away with her heavy
burden with which she is scarce able to wag? This and worse, if worse may be,
is the case of Christ's Spouse, the true Inheritrix of his Cross, which he
bequeathed her at his death, having indeed little else to leave her: for his
soul he was to surrender to God his Father, his body Joseph of Arimathea
begged of Pilat, his clothes the soldiers parted among them; only his
cross, and nails, and crown of thorns remained to dispose of for his
dearest Spouse; which she continually bears about with her, and in this
vision carried with her into the wilderness, whither she fled to save her
life. And the woman

Fled. This picture might have been taken of the Church as she fled from
Pharaoh into the wilderness; or as she fled into Egypt from Herod; or as she
fled into all parts of the earth in the time of the ten first persecutions from
heathen Emperors; or in the succeeding ages from the Arrian Emperors; and last
of all from Antichrist and his instruments: in all which her trialls and
troubles she gained more than she lost. For as Justine Martyr rightly observed,
Just. apolog. Id est persecutio Ecclesiae, quod vineae putatio.
persecution is that to the Church which pruning is to the vine, whereby it is
made more fruitful: with whom Tertullian accords, thus jearing at the
Gentiles, who made full account by their barbarous cruelty to exhaust the whole
Church, and extinguish the name of Christians: Tert. apolog c. ult. Nequicquam
tamen proficit exquisita quaeque crudelitas vestra, illecebra est magis sectae:
plures esficimur quoties metimur a vobis: semen est sanguis Christianorum.
What gain you by your exquisite cruelty and studied torments which you
inflict upon us? they are no scarre-crowes to fright, but rather baits and
lures to draw men to our profession: we ever grow faster and thicker after we
are mowed by you: the shedding the blood of Christians is the sowing the seed
of the Gospel. And St. Leo; I eoserm. 1. in not. Petri and Pauli. Non minuitur
persecutionibus Ecclesia Dei, sed augetur magis: ager Dominicus segete ditiore
vestitur, dum grana quae singula cadunt multiplicata nascuntur.
The Church of God is not diminished by persecutions, but increased rather; the
Lords field is clothed with a richer crop whilst the seed or grains which
fall one by one, after they are dead in the earth rise up again in great
numbers. Moreover, whilst in the chief Cities those who are called by God to
depose for his truth win many thousands to the Christian faith, other servants
of Christ, to whom he has vouchsafed means to escape, by dispersing
themselves into all parts of the world, propagate the doctrine of the Gospel,
and plant new Churches. Upon this flight of the woman in my text, many of the
learned Interpreters take occasion to handle that great case of conscience,
whether it be lawful to fly in time of persecution, or whether all zealous
Christians are not bound to stand to their tackling, and strive for the truth,
even to the effusion of their blood. Aug. l. 22. de civ. Dei c. 7. Pullulatura
foecunditis cum in sanguine Marty^um seretur.
Tert. infug. in ersc^ut.
Tertullian in his book professedly written of this subject is altogether
against flight, grounding his judgment upon the words of our Savior, John
10.11. etc. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the
sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep
are not, sees the Wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: the
hireling flies, because he is an hireling, etc. And Mark 8.35, 38. Whosoever
will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake
and the Gospels, the same shall save it. Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed
of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also
shall the son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father
with the holy Angels. But Saint Austin and others allow of flight in some case,
and they bring very good warrant for it, Christ's express command, Matthew.
10.23. When they persecute you in this city, flee into another. And Matthew.
24.15, 16. When you see the abomination of desolation stand in the holy place,
then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains. And to the end we
should count it no shame to fly in this case, they bring noble presidents for
it, and show us the footsteps in Scripture of Jacob when he fled from Esau: and
Moses, when he fled from Pharaoh: and Eliah, when he fled from Ahab and
Jezabel: and David, when he fled from Saul: and Joseph and Mary when they fled
from Herod. They add also, that by this flight of many in time of persecution
the Church reapeth a double benefit: first, hereby many worthy Doctors and
eminent Professors reserve themselves for better times: next, they in their
flight scatter the seeds of the Gospel, whereby the great Husbandman gathers
a plentiful crop. If the Apostles had not been scattered by the persecution of
Herod, and the primitive Christians by the persecutions of the Heathen
Emperors, and the true Professors in later times by the persecution of
Antichrist, many countries in all likelihood had not been sown with the pure
seed of the Word. The resolution of this question may be taken from my Text: in
such a case as the woman's was here we may fly; that is, when there is no
safety in staying, and God offers us Eagles wings, that is, a fair and
certain means to escape danger. Yea, but Christian courage will rise up
against this, and object, Is not Martyrdom a garland of red Roses? is not the
blood of Saints the best watering of Gods field? can we show more love to
Christ than to sign the Gospel with our blood? will you persuade Christian
soldiers to fly from their colors, nay from their crown? God forbid. I
answer, all are not appointed by God to be Martyrs, nor qualified for so noble
and eminent service. To a Martyr two things are required: 1. A special
calling. 2. An extraordinary spirit.
Even in our Courts of justice a witness that offers himself is not accepted,
he must be brought in by order of law: neither will Christ have any depose for
him that are not called to it, and whom he calls, he endueth them with an
heroicke spirit, and armeth them with faith and patience like armor of proof,
into which the fiery darts of the wicked cannot enter. Every sincere believer
has not a spirit of fortitude given him to conquer the violence of fire, and
dull the edge of the sharpest swords, and weary all tortures and torments.
Moreover, God like a provident Husbandman, though he send much corn to the
Mill to be ground, as Ignatius and others, that they might be served in as fine
manchet at his own table: yet he reserveth always some corn for seed, I
mean some pastors and eminent professors to sow his field in future times,
and propagate Religion to posterity. These may and ought to fly in time of
persecution: provided first that they fly not when their conscience persuades
them that their flight will be a great scandal to Religion, and a
discouragement to the weaker; and they feel in themselves a great and earnest
desire to glorify God by striving for his truth unto blood. For being thus
called by God, and enabled and encouraged, they must prefer Gods glory before
their life, and a crown of martyrdom before any earthly condition.

2. That they leave not the Church destitute. For Christ gives it for one of
the characters of an hireling, to John 10.13.
fly when he sees the Wolf coming, and look to his own safety, taking
little care what becomes of his flock.

3. They must not use any indirect means to fly, they may not betray Gods
truth or their brethren to save their own life: he that saves his life upon
such terms shall lose it, and he that loses his life in Gods cause shall
find it. You will say peradventure, how may this be? I answer, as that which
is lost in Alpheus, after a certain time is undoubtedly found again in
Arethusa: so that which is lost on earth shall be found in Heaven. He that
loses his life for Christ's sake in this vale of tears, shall find it at the
last day in the Psalm. 16.11.
river of pleasures, springing at the right hand of God for evermore. When the
Stars set here, they rise in the other hemisphere; so when Confessors and
Martyrs set here, they rise in heaven, and shall never set again. Therefore as
Christ spoke of Virginity, we may say of Martyrdom: what he spoke of the
garland of white roses, we may of the garland of red; Qui potest capere,
capiat; He that is able to receive it, let him receive it; he that is not
able, let him trace the footsteps of the woman here that fled

Into the wilderness. Not by change of place, says In Apoc. c. 12. Fugit non
mutatione loci, sed amissione status and ornatus.
Pareus, but change of state and condition. I see no reason of such a
restraint; the Church may, and sometimes does fly two manner of ways:

1. Openly, when being persecuted in one country, she posteth into another.

2. Secretly, when she abides where she was, but keeps her self close,
and shunneth the eye of the world, and worshippeth God in secret, mourning for
the abominations and public prophanations of true Religion. Thus then we may
expound the words, the woman fled into the wilderness, that is, she withdrew
her self from public view, kept her exercises of Religion in private, held
her meetings in cryptis (hidden places) as vaults under ground, Heb. 11 38.
They wandered in deserts and mountains, and dens and caves of the earth.
dens and caves in the earth: or if persecution raged above measure, and
without end, removed from country to country, and from city to wilderness for
safety. By wilderness, some learned Expositors understand remote countries,
inhabited by Paynims and Gentiles, where yet the fire of persecution is not
kindled. For, say they, though such places be never so well peopled, yet they
may be termed deserts; because never manured by Gods husbandry, never sown with
the seed of the Word, never set with plants of Paradise, never watered with the
dew of heavenly grace. And if the Church had not removed into such
wildernesses, she had never visited us in England, severed after a sort from
the whole world. Toto divisos Orb Britannos.

But such has been Gods goodness to these Islands, that the woman in my text
was carried with her Ver. 14. And to the woman was given two wings of a great
Eagle.
Eagles wings into these parts, before the Roman Eagles were brought in here:
our Country submitted it self to the Cross of Christ before it stooped to
the Roman scepter. Howbeit, I take not this to be the meaning of this
Scripture. For the propagation of the Church, and the extending her bounds to
the remotest regions of the world, makes her catholic, and by it she
becomes glorious: whereas the Spirit speaks here of her as in some eclipse.
The wilderness therefore here meant, must needs be some obscure place or
region, to which she fled to hide her self. If you demand particularly when
this prophecy was fulfilled; I answer, partly in those Hebrews of whom St.
Paul writes, that they lay in wildernesses, and dens, and caves of the
earth: partly in those Disciples that were in Jerusalem in the time of the
siege, and a little before, who mindful of our Saviors commandment fled into
the mountains, and were miraculously preserved in Pella, as Eusebius writes:
partly in those Christians, who in the days of Maximinus and Dioclesian fled
so far that they never returned back again into any City, but were the
fathers of them that live in woods and deserts, as Hermites; or enclosed within
four walls, as Recluses and Anchorites: partly in those Orthodoxe believers,
who in the reign of the Arrian Emperors took deserts and caves under ground
for sanctuary; of whom St. Hilarie writes saying, L. adver. Auxent. Ecclesia
potius delituit in cavernis, quam in primariis Urbibus eminebat.
The Church rather lurked in holes and vaults under ground in those days, than
showed her self openly in the chief Cities: partly in those professors of
the Gospel, who ever since the man of sin was revealed, have been by him
put to great streights, and driven to lie hid for many years in solitary and
obscure places: in all which persecutions of the Church, God prepared for her
not only a place to lodge in, but a table also that they should

Feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. Some referring
this prophecy to the Jews abode in Pella, find the time to be precisely three
years and an half: others by days understanding years, reckon from the
declining age of Constantine, till the great reformation in our age, near upon
a thousand two hundred and threescore years: in all which time the true Church
has played least in sight, and been in a manner buried in oblivion. But
neither is this calculation exact, neither (as I conceive) does St. John speak
of one flight only, nor of any particular place, nor definite number of
years; but after the manner of Prophets puts a definite number for an
indefinite, and foresheweth that the true Church must for a long time lie hid,
and withdraw her self out of the worlds eye, as it is afterward expressed, a
time, times, and half a time: a time under the heathen Emperors, times under
several Heretics, and last of all, half a time in that last and greatest
tribulation immediately before the utter overthrow of Antichrist. For that Mat.
24.22.
persecution shall be shortened, as our Savior intimates, for the Elects
sake, lest all flesh should perish.

You have here (as before I showed you) the Church of Christ drawn as it were
with a coal, and expressed with three dark and sad marks: 1 Frailty: A
woman. 2 Perplexity: Fled. 3 Obscurity: To the wilderness.
Her nature is frailty: The woman. Her state is uncertainty: Fled. Her glory
obscurity: remained in the wilderness a thousand two hundred and threescore
days.


From the frailty of her nature let us learn a lecture of sober watchfulness;
from the unsettlednesse of her estate, a lecture of prudent moderation; from
her obscurity or latencie, a lecture of modest humility.

1 If the mother be frail, the daughter is like to be weak. They who are
subject to slip and fall must carefully avoid high and narrow ridges, as also
slippery places, and precipices or downefalls. We scarce stand Seneca de ira.
Recedamus quantum possumus a lubrico, vix in sicco firmiter stamus.
sure upon dry, firm, and plain ground; therefore let us beware with all
diligence how we come nigh high ridges with the ambitious, or slipperie places
with the voluptuous, or downefalls with the presumptuous sinner: let us pray to
God 1 To make his way plain before us. 2 To order our steps in the plain
path. 3 To support us continually with his right hand.


2 If the Spouse of Christ be a pilgrim, and flies from place to place, from
City to City, from Kingdom to Kingdom; let us learn by her example, and
from the Apostle's mouth, that Heb. 13.14.
we have here no continuing City, but seek one to come. St. James by an
elegant metaphor calls the affairs of this world Jam 3.6. (...).
(...), the course of nature, a nowne derived from a verb signifying to run;
because the world runs upon wheels. As in triumphs and pompous shows we
see towers, and rocks, and castles, but enpassant, carried in procession, not
staying any where: such is the glory of this world. The portable Arc in the
Old Testament, and the flying woman in the New, are images of the militant
Church in this world; the one was drawn by beasts from place to place, the
other was carried with the wings of an Eagle from Country to Country: neither
of them was fixed. When two Noble men strived about a fish pond, and could by
no means be brought to an agreement, Gregorius Thaumaturgus by miracle
suddenly dried it up: so God in wisdom takes away from us the things of this
life, if we too much strive for them. Wherefore let us not build upon the
sails of a windmill, let us not cast the anchor of our hope on the earth, for
there is nothing to hold by: riches get themselves wings, possessions change
their Lords, great houses, according to Diogenes his apophthegme, vomit and
cast up their owners. The favors of men are like vanes on the top of houses
and steeples, which turn with the wind. The Church in many respects is
compared to the moon, she receives her light from the Sun of righteousness,
she has her waxing and waining, is never without spots, is often eclipsed by
the interposition of the shadow of the earth, I mean the shadows of earthly
vanities. Those who profess the art of turning baser metals into gold, first
begin with abstractio terrestrietatis a materia, the abstraction or drawing
away of earthlinesse from the matter of their metal: in like manner, if we
desire to be turned as it were into fine gold, and serve as vessels of honor
in God house, our earthly dregs and dross must be drawn out of us by the fire
of the Spirit; that is, our earthly cares, our earthly desires, our earthly
hopes, our earthly affections. Hercules could never conquer Anteus, donec a
terra matre eum levasset, till he had lifted him up above the earth his
mother: no more can the Spirit of grace subdue and conquer us to the obedience
of the Gospel, till he has lifted up our hearts from the earth with these
levers, especially the consideration of 1 The vanity of earthly delights. 2 The
verity of heavenly comforts. 3 The excellency of our soul. 4 The high price of
our redemption.


Can we imagine that so incomparable a jewel as is the soul of man was made
to be set as it were in a ring on a swines snout, to dig and root in the earth?
Did God breathe into us spirit and life, nay, did Christ breathe out his
immortal spirit for this end, to purchase us the happiness of a mucke-worme,
that breeds and feeds, lives and dies in the dung? or at the best the
happiness of an Indian Chrysostom. hom. 7. in ep. ad Philipp. (...).
Emmet, that glistereth with gold dust about her? St. Austin has long ago
christened the contentments of this world in the font of tears, by the names
of solacia miserorum, non gaudia beatorum; solaces of wretched, not joys of
blessed ones: at the best they are but reliefes of natural necessities. For
what is wealth but the relief of want? food, but the relief of hunger?
clothing, but the relief of nakedness? sleep, but the relief of watching?
company, but the relief of solitariness? sports and pastimes, but the taking
off the plaster, and giving our wounds a little air, and our selves a little
ease from our continual labor and pains? Like the gnats in Plutarch we run
continually round in the circle of our business till we fall down dead,
traversing the same thoughts, and repeating the same actions perpetually; and
what happiness can be in this? The more we gild over the vanities of this
world with the title of honors, pleasures and riches, the more we make them
like the golden apples which hung at Tantalus his lips, which were snatched
away from him when he offered to bite at them. For the 1 John 2.17.
world passes away, and the lust thereof. Albeit the earth abides, and shall
till the end of the world, which cannot be now far off; yet all Monarchs,
Kingdoms, States, Commonwealths, Families, Houses, pass. There is written
upon them what Balthazar saw, the hand writing upon the walls of his Palace,
Mean, mean, tekel upharsin. Admit they abide for a large time, yet we are
removed from them by persecution, invasion, peregrination, ejection, and death.
Albeit our Lawyers speak of indefeisable estates, and large terms of years
to have and to hold lands on earth, yet they speak without book; for no man
can have a better estate than the rich man in the Gospel, to whom it was said,
Luke 12.20.
Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee, and then whose
shall those things be which thou have provided? so is he that lays up
treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. Wherefore if ever we look
to arrive at the fair haven, we must cast anchor in heaven, and not trust in
uncertain riches, but in the living God: who here provided for the woman both
a lodging and a table in the wilderness. Wherefore let us cast the burden of
our care upon the providence of our heavenly Father, who feeds the young
ravens that call upon him, and undoubtedly will never suffer his children to
starve. There is nothing more choaketh the seed of faith, and dampeth the light
of the spirit, and troubles the peace of conscience than worldly cares,
especially when they are immoderate, inordinate, and distrustful: immoderate
in the measure, inordinate in the means, and distrustful in the cause: when
we say in our hearts, What shall we eat, and what shall we drink, or
wherewithal shall we be clothed? We have but a little oil in our cruse, and
a little meal in our pot; and when that is spent what shall become of us? The
cure of these worldly cares is threefold, by 1 Diversion. 2 Devotion. 3
Deposition of them.


1 By diversion, when we withdraw our mind from these carking cares and vexing
thoughts, to other more pleasant cogitations of Gods former mercies to us, and
the present blessings we enjoy. As Painters, when their eyes be dazzled through
long poring upon over-bright objects, recover them again by looking upon
green glass, or some darker colors, which congregate radios visuales, the
sight beams: or as husbandmen, when their ground is overflown with much water,
make ditches and water furrows to carry it away; so if our minds be
overflowne with the cares of this world, there is no better means to draine
them, than by making another passage for them, and diverting them to the
contemplation of a better subject, as David did his: Psalm. 119.23.24.
Princes did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy
statutes. Thy Testimonies are my delight and Counselors.

2 By devotion and prayer to Almighty God, as Hanna did: 1 Samuel 1.15.
I am a woman of a sorrowful heart: I have drunk neither wine nor strong
drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Count not thine handmaid
for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief
have I spoken hitherto. Then Eli answered, and said, Go in peace; and the God
of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou have asked of him. And she said,
Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight: So the woman went her way, and did
eat, and her countenance was no more sad.

3 By deposition, when being at a stand in our deliberations, and having used
all means to little purpose to relieve our necessities, we in the end lay
down our burden of cares, and wholly rely upon Gods promises. Psalm. 37.3, 5.
Trust in the Lord and do good, and verily thou shall be fed. Commit thy way
unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass. And, Psalm.
34.9.10.
O fear the Lord ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him.
And, ( Heb. 13.5.
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee:) 1 Pet. 5.7.
Casting all our care upon him who cares for us; assuring our selves, that he
who prepared Zoar to save Lot in the burning of Sodom, and Goshen to preserve
the Israelites from the plagues of Egypt, and Pella to rescue his Disciples in
the siege of Jerusalem; he who provided a fountain of water to refresh Hagar
in extremity of thirst, and a cake of dough to satisfy Elias in extremity of
hunger, and the shadow of a gourd to cool Jonas in extremity of heat, and an
Angel from heaven to comfort our Savior in the extremity of his agony, will
never leave us utterly destitute in our greatest perplexities. The woman in my
text was feign to fly into the wilderness, from savage men to savage beasts,
unprovided of a place to lie in, or any manner of food to sustain life; yet
God on the sudden prepared for her both lodging and diet. So did he for the
Israelites, brought to a like exigent: Psalm. 107.4.5.6.
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way, they found no City to
dwell in: hungry and thirsty; their souls fainted in them: then they cried to
the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distress. Mat.
6.32.
Take no thought therefore, says our Savior, for your life, what you shall
eat, and what you shall drink, or wherewithal you shall be clothed: for
your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things. He that
cloatheth the lillies, and feeds the fowls of heaven, will he leave his
children unprovided of things necessary? No, if ordinary means fail, he will
lay an unusual imposition upon all creatures to relieve his chosen. The air
shall serve-in Manna for corn, the hard rock shall gush out with streams of
water, the dry cruse shall spring with oil, the Lions jaws shall drop with
honey, the fowls of heaven shall bring in meat in their bills, and the fish of
the sea bring money in their mouths to supply their several wants, and defray
their necessary charges. Therefore trouble not your selves overmuch with the
cares of this life, but when you have done your utmost endeavors, ease your
selves by relying upon Gods providence; and be confident, that he who feeds
you with the bread of life, will not fail to give you your daily bread; he
that offers you the cup of salvation full of the price of your redemption,
and the grace of sanctification, will not suffer you to die for thirst; he that
cloatheth your souls with the robes of his righteousness, and deckes them
with the jewels of his grace, will undoubtedly provide a covering for your
bodies.

3 If the Church be truly represented by a woman flying into the wilderness,
and there continuing for a long season, certainly outward pomp, and temporal
felicity, and perpetual visibility, are no certain notes of her, but rather
of the malignant Church. For so is the Whore of Babylon described: Apoc. 17.3.4.
A woman set upon a scarlet colored beast, arrayed in purple, decked with
gold, and precious stones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full
of abominations. And ver. 15. The waters which thou saw where the whore
sits, are peoples, and nations, and multitudes, and tongues. The dark foil
sets off the Diamond, and the Church when she is most obscure outwardly is
most glorious within. Albeit temporal felicity gives her some luster, and
furnishes her with means to encourage Proselytes, and erect stately monuments
of piety and charity; yet withal it ministers matter of luxury and pride, it
breeds faction and schism, it withdraws the mind from celestial
contemplation, it abateth her longing desire after the second coming of
Christ: on the contrary, the Cross is like a file that brighteneth all her
spiritual graces, quickens her zeal, puts her noblest virtues to the
test; wisdom by dangers, faith by conflicts, courage by terrors, patience by
torments, and perseverance by perpetual assaults. Witness the prime age
wherein she warmed her zeal at the embers of the Martyrs sepulchers, when she
had no Churches but caves under ground, no wealth but grace, no exercises but
sufferings, no crown but of martyrdom: yet then she thrived best, then she
spread farthest, then she kept her purity in doctrine and conversation, then
she convinced the Jews, then she converted the Gentiles, then she subdued
Kingdoms: whence I infer three corollaries;

1 That the Roman Church cannot be the true Church of Christ. For the true
Church of Christ, as she is described in the holy Scriptures, has for long
time lien hid, been often obscured and eclipsed by bloody persecutions: but
the Roman or Papal Church has never been so; her advocates plead for her,
that she has been always not only visible, but conspicuous; not only
known, but notorious. And among the many plausible arguments of persuasion,
and deceiveable shows of reason, wherewith they amuse and abuse the world,
none prevails so much with the common sort and unskilful multitude, as the
outward pomp and glory of the Papal See. For since most men are led by sense,
and judge according to outward appearance, the Church of Rome, which makes so
goodly a show, and has born so great sway in the world for many ages, easily
induces them to believe that she is that City whereof the Prophet speaks:
Psalm. 87.3.
Glorious things are spoken of thee thou City of God. What more glorious and
glittering to the eye than the Popes triple crown, and the Cardinals hats, and
their Archbishops Palls, and their Bishops miters and crozures, their shining
images, their beautiful pictures, their rich hangings, their gilt rood lofts,
their crosses and relics covered in gold, and beset with all sorts of
precious stones? These with their brightness and resplendency dazzle the eyes
of the multitude: and verily if the Queens daughters glory were all without,
and the kingdom of Christ of this world, and his Church triumphant upon earth;
all the known Churches in the Christian world must give place to the Sea of
Rome, which has borne up her head, when theirs have been under water; has
sat as Queen, when they have kneeled as captives; has braved it in purple,
when they have mourned in sackcloth and ashes. But beloved, Romans 10 17.
faith comes not by sight, but by hearing; and we are not to search the
Church in the map of the world, but in the Scriptures of God; where we find her
a pilgrim in Genesis, a bondwoman in Exodus, a prisoner in Judges, a captive in
the book of Kings, a widow in the Prophets, and here in my text a woman
laboring with child, flying from a red Dragon into the wilderness. I grant
that Christ promises her a kingdom, but not of this world; and peace, but it
is the peace of God; and joy, but it is in the Holy Ghost; and great glory, but
it is within: Psalm. 45.13.
The Kings daughter is all glorious within, etc.

2 That none ought to despise the Churches beyond the seas under the Cross,
but, according to the command of the blessed Apostle, Heb. 13.3.
Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them that suffer
adversity, as heing our selves also in the body. Their turn of sorrow is now,
ours may be hereafter: God has begun to them in a cup of trembling, it is to
be feared it will not pass us, but we and all the reformed Churches shall
drink of it. Our Church in Queen Mary's days resembled this woman in my text,
theirs now does: both never a whit the less, but rather the more the true
Churches of Christ, because they wear his red livery, and bear his Cross.

3 That we ought not to look for great things in this world, but having food
and raiment, as the woman had here in my text, to be therewith contented: and
as she withdrew her self from the eye of the world, so ought we to retire our
selves into our closets, there to have private conference with God, to examine
our spiritual estate, to make up the breaches in our conscience, to pour out
our souls in tears of compunction for our sins, of compassion for the
calamities of our brethren, of an ardent desire and longing affection for the
second coming of our Lord, when he shall put an end, as to all sin and
temptation, so to all sorrow and fear. Amen. Even so come Lord Jesu. To whom,
etc.

THE SAINTS VEST. A Sermon preached on All Saints day at Lincolnes-Inne for
Doctor Preston. THE XXIV. SERMON.
APOC. 7.14. These are they that came out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
THe question which the Elder moved to Saint John in the precedent verse to my
Text, (...); what are these? me thinks I hear some put to me at this
present, saying, What are these holy ones whose feast ye keep? what mean
these devotions? what do these festivities intend? what speak these
solemnities? what Saints are they, Virgins, Confessors, or Martyrs, whose
memory by the anniversary return of this day you eternize? (...); whence came
they? or rather how came they to be thus honored and canonized in our
Calendar? My direct answer hereunto is my Text (These are they, etc.) and the
exemplification thereof shall be my Sermon. The palms they bear are ensigns
of their victory: the robes they wear are emblemes of their glory: the blood
wherein they dyed their robes represents the object of their faith: the white
and bright color of them, their joy: and the length of them the continuance
thereof. Yea but these holy ones (you may object) at least the chief of them
had their days apart; the blessed Virgin hers apart, and the Innocents apart,
the Apostles apart, and the Evangelists apart: how come they now to be
repeated? why commits the Church a tautologie in her menologie? what needs
this sacred (...) or congeries of feasts, blending of devotions, thrusting all
Saints into one day, and that a short one in the rubricke? It is that men may
see by that which we do what we believe in that Article of our Creed, the
communion of Saints. We join them all in one collect, we remember them all
upon one day, because they are all united into one body, admitted into one
society, naturalized into one Kingdom, made free Denisons of one City, and
partakers of one Col. 1.12.
inheritance of the Saints in light. In a word, we keep one feast for them all
upon earth, because they all keep one everlasting feast in heaven, the marriage
Apoc. 19.9.
supper of the Lamb. The Romans, beside several Temples dedicated to
several deities, had their Pantheon, or all-gods temple. See we not in the
sky here single stars glistering by themselves, there constellations, or a
concourse of many heavenly lamps joining their lights? do we not hear with
exceeding delight in the singing of our Church Anthemes, first single voices
answering one the other, and after the whole Quire joining in one, as it were
tracing the same musical steps? has not nature drawn with her pensill a
perfect grass green in the Emrald, a sky color in the Saphir, the glowing of
fire in the Carbuncle, the sanguine complexion in the Ruby, and the twinkling
of the stars in the Diamond, and all these together in the Opall, which has
in it the luster and beautiful colors of all these precious stones, Plin.
not. hist. l. 37 c 6. In Opale est Carbunculi tenuior ignis, Amethysti fulgens
purpura, Smaragdi virens mare, etc.
incredibili mistura lucentes? Such is this feast of all holy ones: it is the
Churches (...), the Kalendars pandect, as it were a constellation not of many,
but of all the stars in the sky: in it as in the Opall shine the beautiful
colors and resplendency of all those precious stones which are laid in the
Apoc. 21.19.
foundation, and shine in the gates and walls of the heavenly Jerusalem. Upon
it we celebrate the chastity of all Virgins, the simplicity of all Innocents,
the zeal and courage of all Confessors, the patience of all Martyrs, the
holiness of all Saints. Upon this day the Church militant religiously
complementeth with the Church triumphant, and all Saints on earth keep the
feast, and express the joy, and acknowledge the happiness, and celebrate the
memory, and embrace the love, and set forth the virtues of all Saints in
heaven. Which are principally three, shadowed by the allegory in my Text: 1.
Patience in tribulation, They came out. 2. Purity in conversation, And washed
their garments. 3. Faith in Christ's death and passion, Made them white in etc.


The better to distinguish them, you may if you please term them three marks:
1. A black or bluish mark made with the stroke or flaile, Tribulation. 2. A
white made by washing their garments, and whiting them. 3. A red, by dying them
in the blood of the Lamb.


1. First of the black or blew mark, They came out of great tribulation. The
beloved Apostle and divine Evangelist Saint John, who lay in the bosom of our
Savior, and pryed into the very secrets of his heart, in the time of his exile
in Pathmos had a glimpse of his and our country that is above; and was there
present in spirit at a solemn investiture or installation of many millions of
Gods Saints into their state of glory, and order of dignity about the Lamb in
his celestial court. The rite and ceremony of it was thus, The twelve Ver. 5,
6, 7, 8.
Tribes of Israel were called in order, and of every Tribe twelve thousand were
sealed in the forehead by an Angel keeper of the broad Seal of the living God
(Ver. 2.) After this signature; Lo a great multitude, which no man can number,
of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne,
and before the Lamb, and they had long white robes put upon them, and palms
given them in their hands in token of victory, and they marched on in triumph
singing with a loud voice, Salvation from or to our God that sits upon the
Throne, and to the Lamb: at which words all the Angels that stood round about
the Throne, and the Elders, and the four living creatures full of eyes fell
before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Praise, and
glory, and wisdom, and thanks, and honor, and power, and might be unto our
God for ever and ever, Amen. This glorious representation of the triumphant
Church so overcame and took away the senses of the ravished Apostle, that
though he desired nothing more than to learn who they were that he had seen
thus honorably installed, yet he had not the power to ask the question of any
that assisted in the action, till one of the Elders rose from his seat to
entertain him, and demanded that of him which he knew the Apostle knew not,
but most of all desired to know, and would have enquired after, if his heart
had served him: viz. who they were, and whence they came that were admitted
into the order of the white robe in Heaven. The answer of which question when
the Apostle had modestly put from himself to the Elder, saying, Lord thou
know, the Elder courteously resolves it, and informs him particularly
concerning them, saying: These are they that are come out of great tribulation,
etc. Thou might perhaps have thought, that these who are so richly arrayed
and highly advanced in Heaven, had been some great Monarchs, Emperors, or
Potentates upon earth, that had conquered the better part of the world before
them, paving the way with the bodies, and cementing it with the blood of the
sl^ine, and in token thereof bare these palms of victories in their hands.
Nothing less; they are poor miserable forlorn people that are newly come
some out of houses of bondage, some out of the galleys, some out of prisons,
some out of dungeons, some out of mines, some out of dens and caves of the
earth, all out of great tribulation. They who wear now long white robes
mourned formerly in black: they who now bear palms in their hands, carried
their crosses in this world: they who shout and sing here, sighed and mourned
under the heavy burdens of manifold afflictions all the days of their
pilgrimage on earth: they whom thou see the Lamb leading to the Ver. 17.
living fountains of waters, drank before deep of the waters of Marah, and
full cups of tears in the extreme heat of bloody persecutions: and in
consideration of the great tribulation which they have patiently endured for
the love of their Redeemer, he bestows upon them these glorious robes whited
in his own blood, and he takes them near to himself, that they may stand
before him for evermore.

Mat. 5, 11, 12.
Blessed, thrice blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake,
for great is their reward in heaven. The heavier their cross is, the weightier
their crown shall be: their present sorrows shall free them from all future
sorrows; their troubles here shall save them from all trouble hereafter; their
temporal pains through his merits for whom they suffer, shall acquit them
from eternal torments; and the death of their body, through faith in his
blood, shall redeem them from death of body and soul, and exempt them from
all danger, misery and fear. Which privileges the spirit seals unto them
in the verses following, They Rev. 7.15.16.17.
are before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and
he that sits on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no
more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any
heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and
shall lead them into living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes.

These are they that came out of great tribulation. Great tribulation in the
judgment of Marlorat is a periphrasis of the last persecution of the Church by
Antichrist, which shall be the hottest service the soldiers of Christ shall
ever be put to. As the last endeavor of nature before death puts the patient
to most pain, and the last assault of Pharaoh put the Israelites to the
greatest extremity; so the last persecution of the Church by Antichrist shall
exceed all the former. Mat. 24.29.
For then the sun (that is, the knowledge of the truth, or the light of Gods
countenance) shall be darkened: and the moon (that is, the beauty of the Church)
shall be obscured and turned into blood; (that is, deformed by bloody
persecutions:) and the stars shall fall from heaven, (that is, the greatest
lights of the Church shall fall from it) and there shall be such perplexity and
distress of nations as never was before: then, as Aug. ep 80. Tunc Ecclesia
non apparebit, impiis ultra modum persequentibus.
St. Augustine infers, the Church shall have no outward appearance, wicked
men raging and cruelly persecuting her above measure.

But I see no reason why we should restrain tribulation to persecution, or
persecution to that of Antichrist. For every great affliction and heavy cross
which the faithful bear in this world, be it loss of goods, or of friends,
banishment, imprisonment, infamy, torture of body, or vexation of mind, is
great tribulation, through which any elect child of God may enter into heaven.
Albeit we yield Martyrs a precedence amongst Saints, yet they alone enter not
into their masters joy. Let their garlands have a red rose added unto it, and
their crown a rubie above the rest; yet assuredly all other that are Apoc.
2.10.
faithful unto death shall receive the crown of life: all that fight a good
fight, and keep the faith, after they have finished their course shall receive
a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give at
that day to all that love his appearing. The article (...) therefore is not
(...), but (...): not demonstrative, pointing to any singular persecution; but
intensive, intimating that many and very great tribulations abide the faithful
servants of God, and they must through them enter into the kingdom of heaven:
their life is nothing else but a Hieron. ep. ad Heliodor. Etras frate^, erras
si unquam putas Christianum persecutionem non pati; tunc maxim oppugnatis, si
te opp^gnati nescis.
race of patience through many tribulations, and a battle of faith against all
kind of temptations. A Christian is never without an enemy to persecute him
inwardly or outwardly: even this is a temptation of the Devil, to think that
we are at any time free from all temptation. For either we are in war with
the World, Flesh, and the Devil, or God will fight against us: either we are
afflicted for our sins, or afflicted with our sins: and if God for a long
time spare us, even this afflicts us that we are not afflicted. For since God
afflicts them whom he affects, we have just cause to fear, because we are
not under his rod we are out of his care; and that therefore he chasteneth us
not here, because he reserveth us to eternal torments. If any demand why God
carries a more severe hand over his children than over the wicked that deserve
less favor; I answer by propounding them the like questions: Why does a
father when he sees two boys fighting in the street correct his son and
not the other? Why does the Schoolmaster take a stricter account of the
Scholar he best affects than of others, whom he suffers often to play the
trewants? Why does the husbandman let unfruitful and unsavory trees grow out
at length without any cutting or pruning, but pruneth the fragrant roses, and
pricketh the fruitful vines till they bleed? Why does the Physician when he
sees his patient desperate, give order to them that are about him to deny him
nothing that he has a mind unto? but if he has any hope of recovery of any
patient of his, he keeps him in diet, forbids him such things as he most
desires, and prescribes for him many meats, drinks, and potions which go
against his stomach. Lastly, why does a Captain set the best Soldiers in the
forefront of a battle, and appoints them to enter at a breach, with apparent
hazard of their lives?

To the first question they will answer, that a wise father takes up his son
sharply, and corrects him for his misdemeanour, and not the other, because he
has a special care of his sons behavior, and not of the other: thus let
them think of the Father of Spirits his dealing with his children, who
chasteneth those faults in them which he seems to wink at in others, because
he bears a singular affection to his own, and has a special care of their
nurture.

To the second they will answer, that a good schoolmaster takes a more strict
account of his best scholar, and more often plyeth him with the rod or feruler
than any other, because he most desires his profit: let them think so of our
heavenly Teacher, that he holds a stricter hand over those in Christ's school
who outstrip others, that they may more profit by him.

To the third they will answer, that an understanding husbandman lets other
trees grow to their full length without cutting or pruning them, because they
are good for nothing but for fire wood; but he pruneth the roses to make them
more savoury, and the vines to make them more fruitful: let them thus conceive
of themselves, that they are like vines that run into luxuriant stemmes, and
roses apt to grow wild: therefore God the Father, who John 5.1.
is an husbandman, pruneth them to make them more savourie in their prayers and
meditations, and more fruitful in good works.

To the fourth they will answer, that the Physician does according to his art
to cure the body; and God does the like in wisdom to cure the soul: they
whom he orders not, setting them in a course of physic, but lets them do
what they will, and have what they call for, are in a desperate case.

To the last they will answer, that the experienced Captain sets the most
valiant soldiers in places of greatest danger, that they may get the greater
honor; so does God set the most valiant Christian upon the most dangerous
service, that thereby he may gain greater honor, and a more massy crown of
glory. Moreover, sin takes us oftentimes after the nature of a falling
sickness, out of which our heavenly Father awaketh us by the stroke of his
rod. Whereby also he beats down the pride of our flesh, and keeps us
always in awe, and constrains us to cry aloud unto him in our prayers: he
makes us sensible of our sins, and compassionate of our brethrens misery,
and conformable to the image of his Son. He weaneth us from this world, and
breeds in us a longing desire to exchange this vale of tears with the river
of pleasures springing at his right hand in Heaven. If God should not send us
sometimes crosses and afflictions, and sauce our joys with sorrows, we would
often surfeit of them, we would take too great liking to this world, and say
with Peter, It is good being here, let us pitch our tents, and take up our rest
here.

This might suffice for the clearing of the first doctrine of this Text, but
that I foresee an objection that may be made against it. How say I tribulation
or afflictions are marks of Gods children, since we see the wickedest men that
breath sometimes full of them? Are not notorious malefactors often apprehended,
cast in prison, scourged to death, tortured upon the rack, broken upon the
wheel, and executed with other most exquisite torments? Do not all the plagues
threatened in the Law fall upon some of Gods enemies in this life? Are not the
very dregs of his vialls of vengeance poured upon them?

For your full satisfaction herein, I propound these ensuing observations to
your serious thoughts.

1. Albeit the judgments of God fall heavily in this life upon some notorious,
obstinate and impenitent sinners; yet for the most part the rod of God falls
to the lot of the righteous: more of them are afflicted, and they more
afflicted than usually the wicked are, who with Dives take their pleasure here,
because, as the Psalmist speaks, their Psalm. 17.14.
portion is in this life.

2. Though afflictions in some sort are common to all sorts of men, yet
chastisements and corrections (meant by the word tribulation in my Text) are
proper to the godly. The calamities and afflictions that befall the ungodly are
punishments for their sins, not chastisements for their good; effects of Gods
justice, not tokens of his love: they are sent to them for their ruin and
destruction, not for their amendment and instruction.

3. Afflictions taken by themselves are not notes or marks of Gods children,
but afflictions with patience, and tribulation with joy: crosses heavier or
lighter are laid upon all men, but none bear them cheerfully save Gods
children. The wicked when they feel the hand of God upon them, rise up against
him, but the godly submit themselves under his mighty hand, and commit their
souls to him as their faithful Creator: the wicked Revel. 16.12.
gnaw their tongues and curse, but the godly Job 1.21.
bless and praise God: the wicked have little or no sense of the wrath of God
or their sin, but of their punishment; but the godly are much more grieved at
the wrath of God and their sin than their punishment: the wicked have always
their eyes upon their wounds, stripes and sores, but the godly on the hand that
smites them; which when they see to be the hand of their heavenly Father, they
compose themselves to patience, they humble themselves before him, and confess
their sin, they open all their wounds and sores, crying with that religious
Father, hic ure, hic seca, here burn, here lance, here prick my veins, here
feed me with the bread of affliction, here give me my full draught of the cup
of tears, that all tears may be wiped from my eyes hereafter; chasten and
judge me here, that I be not condemned with the world. This holy Aug. de Civit.
Dei, l. 1. c. 8. Manet dissimilitudo passorum etiam in similitudine passionis:
et licet sub eodem tormento non est idem virtus atque vitium: nam sicut sub
codum igne aurum rutilat, palea fumat, and sub eadem tribula stipulae
comminuuntur, frumenta purgantur, etc. ita una eademque vis irruens, bonos
probat, purificat, eliquat, malos damnat, vastat, exterminat.
Father elsewhere lively expresses the difference between the godly in their
sufferings, and the wicked, by the similitude of the same flayle that strikes
the corn out of the ear, but bruiseth the stubble; the same fire that purges
the gold, but consumes the dross; the same motion that causes an ointment to
send forth a most fragrant smell, but a sink to exhale a most noisome savor.
The godly are whole under the flayle of tribulation; their faith like gold
shines in that fire, in which the hypocrites smoke like chafe; their
devotion sends forth a most sweet savor, when they pour out their souls
before God, but the wickeds consciences being troubled, like sinkes that are
stirred, exhale most pestilent aires, breathing out blasphemies and
execrations. In a word, the wicked and godly come out of great tribulation, but
the godly come out of it clean, the wicked foul; the one with their garments
soyled and rayed, the other with their garments washed and made white.

They washed their garments and made them white. Thus having descried all holy
ones by their blew mark, let us now view the white; they have washed, (...).
Pareus acutely notes, that it is not here said that the Saints Comment. in
Apoc. c. 7.
do wash, but have or had washed their garments. For indeed there is no
washing in heaven, because there can no impure thing enter there: he that is
unclean at his death remains unclean still. For, as St. Cypr. ad Demet.
Postquam hinc excessum fuerit nullus est jam poenitentiae locus, nullus est
satisfactionis effectus; hic vita aut amittitur aut tenetur.
Cyprian truly informs Demetrian, After we are gone from hence there is no
place for repentance, no effect of satisfaction; here eternal life is got or
lost. Here one drop from our eyes can fetch out that spot which an ocean cannot
do hereafter. Let us seek God therefore while he may be found, strive to
enter in before the gate of mercy be locked up, work while we have day, wash
while we have water and soape, do good while we have time, break off our
sins, and wash our polluted consciences with our penitent tears, and purge
them with hyssop dipped in Christ's blood, before we hear that dreadful order
read in our ears; Apoc. 22.11.
He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is filthy, let him be
filthy still: behold I come, and my reward is with me, to give every man
according as his works shall be. The whiteness here of the garments of them
whom Saint John saw invested, signifies the candor and purity of their life,
without spot of foul sin, or stain of infamy. This is a conspicuous note of
Gods children, Phil. 2.15, 16.
who shine as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, holding
forth the word of life. It is not enough to have a clear conscience within us,
we must see that our Mat. 5.16.
works so shine before men, that they may see them, and glorify our Father
that is in heaven. To represent this outward purity and integrity of the Saints
to the Apoc. 19.8.
wife of the Lamb, it was granted, that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
clean and white: for the fine linen, says St. John, is the righteousness of
Saints. As virtue in Arist. ethic l. 8. (...).
Aristotle's time was the character of a Grecian, and vice of a Barbarian; so in
the first and best ages of the Church a Christian was distinguished from a
Heathen by his innocence and charity: they suffered all, they offered no wrong;
they visited the sick how infectious soever the disease was, they defended the
fatherless and the widow, and kept themselves unspotted of the world: the
light of their good works so dazzled the eyes of the Infidels, that even malice
it self confessed them to be good men. Tert. in Apolog. Bonus Caius tantummodo
malus quod Christianus.
Caius is an honest man, he has but one fault, that he is a Christian: I
could love Seius with all my heart, setting aside his religion. Such speeches
Tertullian overheard the Gentiles use concerning those innocent lambs in his
days, which were daily sacrificed by the Roman Emperors. Doubtless, as the
purer blood in the veins causes a better color and complexion in the outward
parts; so the purer the faith and religion is, it begets always in all the
sincere professors thereof a holier life and conversation.

You will object, that as when a law was made among the Romans that chaste
Matrons should wear a kind of girdle to distinguish them from Bodin de rep.
Curtizans, that all the Curtizans in Rome, though never so dissolute, got on
those girdles: so that if outward conformity and purity in conversation be
given for a note of a Saint, that many Hypocrites, Heretics, and Schismatikes
will lay a fair claim to sanctity. For Priscillian was of a most strict life,
Novatus outstripped most catholic Bishops in outward appearance and semblance
of holiness, John of Constantinople, who first usurped the title of universal
Bishop, for his continual fasting and praying was surnamed (...), Jejunator,
the Faster: but

I answer with Lib. 2. de anima. Non urit ignis pictus, nec rugit leo marmoreus.
Lodovicus Vives, Paint a fire most artificially, yet it will not burn; it may
deceive the sight, but not the touch. Cut the proportion of a Lion in marble,
or carve it in wood, and lay live colors upon it; yet be confident this wooden
or marble Lion will never roar, much less devour. The grapes which Zeuxis
painted had the color, but not the taste of grapes: a glow worm has the
light, but not the heat of fire: a counterfeit stone has the luster, but not
the virtue of a precious stone: hypocrisy, heresy, and schism have the
vizard, but not the face of holiness: their outward conformity, and seeming
sanctity, differs from theirs who are holy ones indeed, in three things: 1 It
is not sincere. 2 Not entire. 3 It is not permanent or constant.


1 It is not sincere: pone in pectore dextram, nil calet: though their veins
swell, and their faces be as red as blood, as if they were all fire and made of
zeal; yet if you could put your hand into their bowels, you should find their
heart either but key cold or luke warm, like a false gemme in which the light
is in the outside only, and not in the body of the stone. Such is their zeal
and precise purity, in which they will streine at the gnat of a ceremony and
harmless custom in public, and yet swallow a Camel of ougly heresy, or
beastly sensuality, or biting usury, or abominable sacrilege in private. Prove.
30.12.
They are a generation pure in their own eyes, but yet are not washed from
their filthiness: they, as St. Greg. mor. in Job l. 34. Quasi habitam
sanctitatem ante oculus hominum videntur amittere, sed eam ante oculos Dei
nunquam habuerunt.
Gregory speaks, may seem in the eyes of men to be clothed with holiness,
but in Gods eyes they are stark naked.

2 It is not entire: if they are forward in the duties of the first table, you
shall take them tardy in the duties of the second: if they are strict one way,
you shall find them loose enough another way: like Numa they have a Nymph
Aegeria in a corner, some private sin which they hugg in their bosom, either
of covetousness, as Seneca; or of ambition, as John the Faster; or
wantonness, as Montanus; or fraudulent lying and cousening, as Priscillian; or
spiritual pride and uncharitable censuring of others, as Novatus.

3 It is not constant: their sanctity is like painted beauty, which is washed
away with a storm, or drops over a fire: they are true Ephraimites, Their Hos.
6.4.
goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away: their
over hot zeal soon slaketh, and their charity in time waxes cold. Fained
things, says the Orator, like blossoms soon fall, or are blown away with a
puff of wind; true virtue takes root and propagateth it self. The
experience of all times makes it good, that those things which have had but a
show of appearance, have had but a thought of continuance.

We have discerned the Saints by two marks, their blew and their white: there
remains yet one more, their red mark. They have died their garments

In the blood of the Lamb; that is, their own innocent blood, says Saint
Austin: but herein venerable Beda shoots nearer to the mark: They washed
their garments, and made them white in the blood of Christ, who is the Lamb of
God that takes away the sins of the world. Saint Aug. Sermon. 2. de sanct.
Stolas Martyrs laverunt dum membra sua quae oculis insipientium visa sunt
poenarum squalore foedare, sic potius fuso pro Christo sanguine ab omnibus
mundavere contagiis.
Austin indeed draws a fine line, but without the rules of the text: The
Martyrs, says he, washed their robes in blood when they cleansed their
members from all contagion by their blood shed for Christ, wherewith in the
eyes of fools they seemed to defile and deforme their bodies. But neither is it
said here they washed their robes in sanguine agnino, or sanguine suo, but
sanguine (...), which Beza well rendereth agni illius: they washed not their
garments in their own blood, or lambs blood simply, but Beza annot. in Apoc.
the blood of that lamb, who, ver. 17. shall feed them and lead them unto
living fountains of waters. Neither is it the blood which we shed for Christ,
but the blood which Christ shed for us, that John 1.7.
cleanses us from all sin. It is true, that the blood of Martyrs shed for the
testimony of the Gospel, is a most acceptable sacrifice unto God; yet not
propitiatory for their or our sins. Blood spilt for Christ is no stain but
an ornament; it does no way deforme the body of a Martyr, as the foolish
heathen imagined, whom Saint Austin there justly taxes, but makes them more
lovely in the eyes of God and all his Saints: yet because their blood is some
way defiled, it cannot cleanse or purge, much less make white their, or our
robes. These are the three privileges of the clean and pure blood of the
immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus, which Apoc. 1.5.
Washes. John 1.7.
Cleanses. Apoc. 7.14.
Whiteth.


It washes us in our regeneration, cleanses us in our justification, and
whiteth us in our glorification: it washes away the filth of sin in our
regeneration, it cleanses us from the guilt of sin in our justification, and
makes us white, that is, perfectly just and righteous, not by imputation only,
but by inhesion; or, as the schools speak, inherent righteousness in our
Heb. 12 23. To the spirits of just men made perfect.
glorification. They washed

Their robes. Not their robe in the singular, but their robes in the plural
number; because as every guest at the Kings supper had his peculiar wedding
garment, so here every Saint has his robe of glory: all are long and down to
the feet, yet some longer than other, according to their stature that ware
them. For the proportion of glory in heaven answers the proportion of grace
here. Some strain the letter farther, and from hence infer, that all Saints
have a double robe given unto them; one in this life, another in the life to
come: the one washed indeed, but yet not without some spots cast upon it
through carnal frailty, which are covered by Christ; the other is whited, and
without any spot or stain, and this is reserved for us in the wardrob of
heaven. But I rather infer from hence, that if there be such virtue in
Christ's blood, that it not only washes the Saints robes, but makes them
perfectly white: if it can change the color and hiew of any sin of the
deepest dye, and though it be as Esaias 1.18.
red as scarlet, make it as white as wool; that there is no need at all of
Romish holy water, or Mary's milk, or the soape of Saints merits. If Christ's
blood purges us from all sin, and all dross is sin, what remains for
Purgatory fire to work upon, but the gold of their purses that have faith in
those imaginary flames? St. Delicatus est Christi sanguis, alienum non patitur.
Bernard truly observes, that the blood of the Lamb is most pure and
delicate blood, it will endure no mixture with any other thing. All things by
the law were purified by the blood of sacrifices, and in the Gospel by the
sacrifice of Christ's blood.

Yea, but it is said, Acts 15.9.
Faith purifieth the heart; how then is it here said, that their robes were
washed and made white with Christ's blood? I answer, that Christ's blood whiteth
as the soape or nitre, but faith as the hand of the Laundresse. Christ's blood
heals us as the plaster, faith as the finger of the Apothecary applying it.
Christ's merits and death acquit and free us as the ransom tendered for our
redemption, faith is as the hand that receives this sum from Christ, and
tendereth it to the Father for the redeeming of our souls. When the Temple of
Jerusalem was on fire, nothing could quench the flame but the blood of the
slain: in like manner, when Gods wrath is kindled against his servants, which
are living Temples of the Holy Ghost, nothing can quench the flame, but the
blood of the immaculate Lamb, that was slain from the beginning of the world.

Secondly, from hence I would infer for the comfort of all affrighted
consciences, that if they have renewed their covenant in Christ's blood, and
purified their hearts by faith before their death, they need not fear to come
into the presence of God. For though his eyes are most pure, and they full of
sores and corruption; yet they need not any way be dismayed, because there shall
be long white robes given unto them, to cover all from the sight of God. Mary
Magdalen washed Christ's feet with her tears, but Christ washes not only our
feet, but our hands, head, and whole body with his own blood; and thereby
fetches out all the stains of our consciences, and makes our souls appear
most fair and lovely in the eyes of Almighty God. O royal bath! O the true
Mare rubrum, or red Sea, in which the spiritual Pharaoh and all his host are
destroyed, and through which we pass not, as the Jews did, into the
wilderness, but into Paradise! In this royal bath, or rather indeed red Sea
of Christ's blood, I will drown my discourse at this present, and shut up all
with that Epiphonema of St. John: Apoc. 1.5.6.
To him that loved us, and washed our sins in his own blood, and has made
us Kings and Priests to God and his Father: to him be glory and dominion for
ever, Amen.

SERMONS PREACHED AT SERJEANTS-INNE IN FLEETSTREET.
THE CHRISTIAN VICTORY. THE XXV. SERMON.
APOC. 2.17. To him that overcommeth will I give to eat of the hidden Manna,
and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which
no man knows saving he that receives it.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
MEdals and small pictures that are showed us under the cover of a crystal
glass are most delightful to the eye: Pref.
such are the images of divine truth, and heads of heavenly doctrine, whereof
you have a glympse in my text, through the mirror of an elegant allegory. The
glass of art gives both light to the pictures, and delight to the beholders.
Notwithstanding for your more exact view, and my particular handling of them, I
will open the Crystal cover, and take them out one by one in order as they
are set in the letter; wherein 1 A condition is propounded, to him that
overcommeth. 2 A promise upon condition is made, I will give. Divis.
3 Three gifts upon promise are specified; 1 Hidden Manna (which some make) a
type of election. 2 A white stone, an emblem of justification. 3 A new name,
an imprese of glorification.



In the review of the words mark, I beseech you, the connection of the
doctrinall points which stand as it were out of the words.

1 No man knows the new name, save he that receives it. Connex.
2 No man receives it, but he that has the white stone. 3 No man has the
white stone, but he that eats the Manna. 4 No man eats the hidden Manna,
but he to whom it is given. 5 It is given to none to eat thereof, but to him
that overcommeth the Devil by his faith, the World by his hope, the Flesh by
his charity, all baits and allurements by his abstinence, all crosses and
afflictions by his patience, all conflicts and assaults of temptations by his
constant perseverance unto the end.


Obser.
1 It is said to him that overcommeth, to include our labor and industry: yet
it is added, I will give, to exclude merit.

2 It is said (...) to him, that is, to every one, (for an indefinite
propofition in materia necessaria, is equivalent to an universal) to teach us,
that the promises of the Gospel are general: yet to the (...) is added (...),
to him that overcommeth, to show us that this generality is conditional.

3 The Spirit says not to him that fights, but to him that overcommeth. All
virtues adorn a Christian, but perseverance alone crowns him.

4 To him that overcommeth the Spirit says not I will give to see, but to eat
of the hidden Manna, and receive the white stone, with the new name. Our
eternal happiness consists not in the bare contemplation, but fruition of
the hidden Manna, the white stone, and the new name.

5 It is not Manna simply, but the hidden Manna: nor a stone, but a white
stone: nor a name, but a new name: every subject has here his adjunct, every
face his shadow, every letter his flourish, every diamond his foil, every kind
his quality. All Manna is not the hidden: what is this hidden Manna? All
precious stones are not the white: what is this white stone? All names are not
new names: what is this new name? O thou who have the key of David, and openest
and no man shuts, open the treasure of this Scripture, that we may see what
heavenly mysteries lie in this hidden Manna, are engraven in this white stone,
and charactered in this new name.

Alter in alterius jacientes lumina vultum.

You shall hardly light upon any vision or revelation in this book concerning
the succeeding estate of the Church, which has not some kind of reference to
the predictions of the ancient Prophets of things already accomplished. God, to
whom all things past and future are eternally present, in his infinite wisdom
has so fitted latter events to former presidents, that the same perspectives
of Prophetical visions, for the most part, in which holy men under the law saw
things now long past, serve St. John to represent unto him the image of the
last times, even till our Lords second coming. For brevity sake at this time I
will instance only in my text, where every word is a relative. The first,
vincenti, refers you to Job 7.1. Is not the life of man a warfare upon
earth? The second, Dabo, I will give, to Luke 12.32. It is your Fathers
pleasure to give you a kingdom. The third, Manna absconditum, the hidden
Manna, to Exodus 16.33. Take a pot, and put an Omer full of Manna therein, and
lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. The fourth,
Calculum candidum, the white stone, to Esaias 28.16. Behold, I lay in Zion a
tried stone, a precious stone. The fifth, novum Nomen, a new name, to Esaias 62.2.
And thou shall be called by a new name. Christ who has overcome the world,
under these metaphors looking to foregoing prophesies and promises, incourageth
all Christians like valiant Soldiers to follow him, setting before them all
spiritual delicacies, employed in the hidden Manna, all treasures in the white
stone, all true honor in the new name. To him that overcommeth pleasure, and
abstaines from sinful delights, I will give hidden Manna. To him that
overcommeth covetousness, and esteems not of worldly wealth and earthly
treasure, I will give a white stone. To him that overcommeth ambition, and
seeks not for a name upon earth, I will give a new name, written in heaven.
In many other texts the letter is easy, but the spiritual meaning difficult:
but on the contrary, in this the spiritual meaning is facile, and out of
question, but the letter is much controverted. For some contend, that the
metaphor is here taken from the manner of feasting great Personages, wherein
the Prince, Ambassador, or great Statesman is entertained with rare and
reserved dainties, served in under covered dishes; and after the last course
has a medall, or a stone with his name engraven in it, and a posie given unto
him; which, because he carries away with him, and keeps it as a memorial of
his honorable entertainment, the Greeks call (...): this is Alcasar his
conceit. Others place the Scene, if I may so speak, in a Green, where he that
out-runneth the rest, receives a white stone: this is Aretus his guess. A
third sort of Expositors run upon a pitched field, which he that wanne had
his victory with his name entered into the Roman Fasti with a white stone: this
is Sixtus Senensis his interpretation. But the most of our later Commentatours
imagine, that Christ had an eye to the Roman Judicial proceedings in their
Courts, in which he that overcame his accuser, and had the better of the cause,
was absolved by the Judges casting white stones into an urne or pitcher. Mos
erat antiquis, niveis, atrisque lapillis
His damnare reos, illis absolvere culpa.


But since we have the Jewel, let us not much trouble our selves about the
casket: let us not contend about the shell, but rather taste the kernel.

To him, that is, to every one. As Dido at the building of Carthage offered
like privileges to the Tyrians and Trojans, saying, Virg. Aen. 4.
Tros, Tyriusque mihi nullo discrimine agetur: so Christ in the building of the
spiritual Jerusalem, which is his Church, puts no difference between Jew
and Gentile, but propounds salvation upon like conditions of repentance and
faith unto all. At his incarnation he took not upon him the singular person of
any man, but the common nature of all men, and accordingly offered himself a
surety for all mankind, laying down a sufficient ransom for all, and
inviting all by the hand of faith to take so much as may serve to free
themselves, and satisfy for their debt. Esaias 55.1.
Ho, every one that thirsts, says the Prophet, come ye to the waters; and he
that has no money: come ye, buy ye wine and milk without money, and without
price. John 7.37.
If any man thirst, says our Savior, let him come unto me and drink. He that
believes on me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
of living water. Mat. 11.28.
Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest. Apoc. 3.20.
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open
the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him. In the law of Moses
there is a great difference between the Jew and the Gentile; but in Christ
there is none at all: we who were sometimes far off, are made nigh by his
blood. Ephesians 2.14.
For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle
wall of partition between us. Through him we have an access by one Spirit
unto the Father. ver. 18.
Now therefore we are no more strangers and forreiners, ver. 19.
but fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the household of God: Ephesians. 3.6.
Fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of God his promise in
Christ by the Gospel. Now as there is one shepherd, so but one sheepfold: and
for this very cause Christ is called Lapis angularis, the corner stone; because
the Gentiles and Jews, like two sides of a wall, join in him, and are built
up to make a holy Temple unto the Lord, which is his visible Church. Neither
are the Gentiles only admitted into the terrestrial Jerusalem and Church
militant, but also into the celestial and Church triumphant. For so we read,
that after there Apoc 7.4.9.
were sealed an hundredth and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the
children of Israel, Lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all
nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues stood before the throne, and
before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands. Before
Christ came into the flesh, there was as it were a small wicket open in heaven
for the Gentiles, at which some few entered one by one; as Jethro, and Job, and
Melchizedeck, and the King of Nineveh, and the Queen of the South, and some
other: but since the death, resurrection, and ascension of our Lord, we read
of a Apoc. 4.1.
great door opened in heaven, at which great multitudes may enter together.
Even from the beginning of Christ's coming into the flesh the Gentiles went in
equipage with the Jews. For when the Angel preached the incarnation of Christ
to the Jews, a new Star preached it to the heathen Sages, that all men might
know, according to Simeon his prophecy, that Luke 2.32.
he was no less a light to lighten the Gentiles, than the glory of his people
Israel. For this cause we may conceive it was, that he was borne in an Inn,
not in a private house; and baptized in the river Jordan, not in a peculiar
font; and suffered without the walls of the City, to make it manifest unto us,
that the benefit of his incarnation, baptism, death and passion, is not
impropriated to any sort of people, nor enclosed within the pale of Palestine,
but like the beams of the Sun diffused through the whole world. Thus far
we all teach universal grace, that is, the grace and favor of God, offered
unto all by the preaching of the Gospel; not the grace (they call sufficient)
conferred upon all since Adam's fall. This secret belongs unto God, to whom
he will make this offer of grace effectual; but that which he has revealed
belongs to us and our children, that Tit. 2.11, 12, 13.
The grace of God that brings salvation has appeared unto all men, teaching
us, that denying ungodliness and wordly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope,
and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Savior Jesus Christ. The
2. Tim. 2.19
foundation of God remains firm, having this seal, God knows who are his,
not we. We therefore who are dispensers of the mysteries of salvation, must be
open handed unto all, and indifferently tender unto them the precious pearl
which the rich Merchant man sold all that he had to buy.

First, because it is Christ's express command that we should do so: Go,
says Christ, preach to all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost. Or as we find his words related by Saint Mark; Mark
16.15.
Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that
believes, and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be
damned.

2 Next, Because the Elect could not be called by us who cannot discern them
from the reprobate, if we preached not the Gospel to all without exception.
Howsoever therefore our preaching to the reprobate does them little good,
proving no better unto them than a savor of death unto death; yet our labor
is not in vain in the Lord, because in every assembly we may piously hope
there may be some if not many of the Elect, to whom the Word will prove a
savor of life unto life.

3. Lastly, By thus propounding conditions of peace, and a desire of
reconciliation on Gods part through Christ unto all, the reprobate are debarred
of that excuse which otherwise they might use, (viz.) that they would have
embraced Christ if he had been offered unto them, and have walked in the light
of the Gospel if it had shined upon them.

Tullie speaks of a Panchrestum medicamentum, a remedy for all diseases; and
Pliny of Panaches, a salve for every sore. Such a catholic medicine, such an
universal salve is the death and passion of Christ, not only sufficient for
all, but also sovereign and effectual unto all: but then this potion must be
taken, this salve must be applied.

hidden Manna, and the white stone, and the new name are promised to every one
that is so qualified. The promises of the Gospel are general, that none should
despair; but yet conditional, that none should presume. Eternal life by the
ministry of the Gospel is offered unto all, but upon condition of faith: John
3.16.
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son: that whosoever
believes in him should not perish, but have life everlasting. Pardon and
remission of sins is promised unto all, but upon condition of repentance and
new obedience: Ezekiel. 18.21.22
If the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep
all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live,
he shall not die. All his transgressions that he has committed, they shall not
be mentioned unto him; in his righteousness that he has done, he shall live.
Rest is offered unto all, but upon condition of submission to Christ's yoke:
Mat. 11.29.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart:
and you shall find rest unto your souls. Salvation is offered unto all, but
upon condition of Mat. 13.13.
perseverance: he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. An
incorruptible crown is promised unto all, but upon condition of faithfulness:
Be Apoc. 2.10.
thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life. Fishermen
in their draw-nets use both lead and cork; lead to pull down some part of it
under water, cork to keep the other above. As Fishermen, so likewise the
Fishers of men in the draw-net of the Gospel make use both of cork and lead;
the general promises like cork bear us up (in hope) the conditions like lead
keep us down (in fear.) These conditions cannot be performed without grace;
therefore all must implore divine aid: yet grace performs them not without
the concurrence of our will. We must therefore exercise our natural faculties,
we must seek the Kingdom of God, we must strive to enter in at the narrow
gate, we must search for wisdom as for treasure, we must labor for the meat
that perishes not, we must stir up the graces of God in us, we must work out
our salvation with fear and trembling. Cic. lib. 2. de orat.
Lepidus lying all along upon the grass, cried out, Utinam hoc esset laborare,
O that this were to labor and get the mastery; so many stretching themselves
upon their ivory beds, and living at ease in Sion, say within themselves,
Utinam hoc esset militare, O that this were to go in warfare, and fight under
the cross: but let them not deceive themselves, heaven is not got with a wish,
nor paradise with a song, nor pardon with a sigh, nor victory with a breath, it
will cost us many a blow and wound too before we overcome.

Omnes necessarii, omnes adversarii. Against all these enemies of our peace
with God we hang up a flag of defiance in our crisme, and lift up our ensign
when we are crossed in the forehead, and proclaim a war under Christ's
banner, (in our renouncing the Devil and all his works) which begins at
the Font, and ends at our Grave. Philip graced his war against the
Phocenses, and our Ancestors their exploits against the Saracens for Palaestine
with the title of Bellum sacrum, the holy War: but neither of their
expeditions and martial attempts so properly deserved that appellation, as
this I am now to describe unto you. Those wars were for Religion in truth or
pretense; but this war is Religion and true Christianity: and the weapons of
this warfare are no other than holy duties and divine virtues, which by some
are reduced to three: 1. Prayer, 2. Fasting, 3. Almsdeeds.
For, say they, as our enemies are three, the Devil, the Flesh, and the World;
so they tempt us to three vices especially, 1. Pride, 2. Luxury, 3. Avarice.


Now our strongest weapon 1 Against pride, is humble prayer. 2 Against luxury,
frequent fasting. 3 Against avarice, charitable alms.
Howbeit, though these are the most usual, and, if I may so speak, portable
arms of a Christian; yet there are in his armorie many more, and some more
forcible than these, which St. Ephesians. 6.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
Paul takes out, and gilds over with these sacred attributes; the sword of the
Spirit, the helmet of salvation, the shield of faith, the breast plate of
righteousness, the girdle of truth, the shoes of preparation of the Gospel of
peace. As this war is thus holy in respect of the weapons used in it, so much
more in respect of the Prince that decrees it, the Heralds that proclaim it,
the field where it is fought, and the cause for which it is undertaken. The
Prince who decrees this war is the Holy One of Israel, the Heralds that
proclaim it are the Ministers of the Gospel, the field where the battle is
fought is the militant Church, the end for which it is undertaken is the
advancement of Christ's kingdom of grace in us, and us in the kingdom of
glory. The Roman Historians divide their wars into three kinds; 1 Externa,
foreign. 2 Civilia, civil. 3 Servilia, servile.
Foreign against other States. Civil against seditious Citizens. Servile
against mutinous slaves.
This our war partaketh of all these three kinds, and may be termed both a
foreign, a civil, and a servile war. A foreign, in respect of Satan and his
band. A civil, in respect of the world. A servile, in respect of the flesh and
slavish lusts that war against the Spirit.


In other wars some are exempted by their calling, as Priests; some by their
sex, as women; some by their years, as old men and children; some by their
indisposition of body or mind, as sick and impotent persons not able to bear
arms: but in this war it is otherwise; none can challenge any privilege.
Not Priests, for they blow the trumpet, and give the onset; not children, for
as soon as they are borne they are enrolled in the Captains book, and are
crosse-signed for this service in baptism: and it may be said of many of them
as Pet. Dam. sermon. de sanct. Vict. Prius vicit quam vincere noscet.
Damianus spoke of St. Victor the confessor, He conquered before he could know
what it was to conquer: and St. Cyprian of martyred infants for Christ in his
days, Cyp. ep. 4. Aetas necdum habilis ad pugnam idonea, extitit ad coronam.
The age which was not yet fit for war was found worthy to receive a crown.
Not women, for they fight daily the good fight of faith, and many of them are
crowned in heaven with white and red garlands; white, consisting of lillies, in
token of their chastity and innocent purity; red, consisting of roses, in
testimony of their Cyp. de ^a^. vi^g. ^ortior (...) vi^is to^quen^ u^
i^ve^tutor.
blood shed for the name of Christ. Not aged and infirm persons, for like
Saint 2 Cor 12 10.
Paul, when they are weak then they are strong, nay when they are weakest then
they are strongest; when they are weakest in body, they are strongest in
spirit; when they lie on their deathbed, and are not able to stir hand nor
foot, they grapple with the 1 Pet. 5.8.
roaring Lion (that runs about seeking whom he may devour) and conquer him
by their faith. In other wars though the fight last many hours, yet in the
end either the night, or the weather, or the victory, or the flight on one side
parts the armies, and oftentimes necessity enforces on both sides a truce
for a time: but this war admits no intermission, abides no peace or
truce; all yielding is death, and treaties of peace mortal. In all other
battles he that kills conquereth, and he that is slain is conquered; but
in this the persecuters who slay are Cyp. d^ laps. Se^^ciunt to^^ to^quentibus
fo^^tor^s, and pulsantes, and la^^nt^s un^^las, puls^ta and l^mat^ membra,
vicerunt.
conquered; and the Martyrs who are slain, and breath out their souls with a
triumphant Io Paean in the flames of fire, are the conquerers. Pareus in Apoc.
Corporaliter victi sunt, spiritualiter vicerunt, dum in vera Christi fide ad
mortem us^; perstiterunt.
Paraeus expounds this riddle, The servants of Christ who seal the truth
with their blood, are in their bodies mastered, but in their souls undaunted,
and much more unconquered; whilst notwithstanding all the tortures and
torments which the malice of man or devil can put them to, they persist in the
profession of the true faith unto death: For this is the 1 John 5.4.
victory of the world, even our faith. In that famous battle at Leuctrum,
where the Thebans got a signal victory, but their Captain Epaminondas his
deaths wound; Plutarch writes of him that he demanded whether his buckler had
been taken by the enemy, and when he understood that it was safe, and that
they had not laid hands on it, he died most willingly and cheerfully. Such is
the resolution of a valiant soldier of Christ Jesus, when he is wounded even
unto death, he has an eye to his shield of faith, and finding that out of the
enemies danger, his soul marches out of this world, singing Saint Paul's
triumphant ditty; 2 Timothy 4.7.8
I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth is laid up for me
a crown of righteousness.

To clear the sum which I have been all this while in casting; Christian
victory is a prerogative of the regenerate, purchased unto them by Christ's
death and resurrection, whereby in all conflicts and temptations they hold out
to the end, and in the end overcome on earth, and after triumph in heaven.

First, it is a prerogative of the regenerate: for none but those that are 1 John 5.4.
borne of God overcome the world.

Secondly, this prerogative is purchased unto them by Christ, and therefore the
Apostle ascribes the glory of it to his grace: 1 Cor. 15.57
Thanks be unto God who gives us victory through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Thirdly, this victory is not in one kind of fight, but in all, whether Satan,
the world, or the Devil assault us; whether they lay at our understanding by
sophistical arguments, or at our will by sinful persuasions, or at our senses
by unlawful delights: whether our profession be oppugned by heresy, or our
unity by schism, or our zeal by worldly policy, or our temperance by
abundance, or our confidence in God by wants, or our constancy by persecution,
or our watchfulness by carnal security, or our perseverance by continual
batteries of temptations; in all we are more than conquerours through him that
loved us. Romans 8.35.36.37.
What, or who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (as
it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted
as sheep for the slaughter;) Nay in all these things we are more than
conquerours, etc.

1 Exasperation. 2 Courage. 3 Constancy.


Exasperation sets him on, Courage gives him strength, and Constancy
holds out to the end. Exasperation is necessary, because anger (as Aristotle
teaches) is the goad or spur of fortitude: neither indeed can any man
maintain a hot fight in cold blood. And this is the cause why we are so often
put to the worst in our spiritual conflicts, because we fight like her in the
Poet, Tanquam quae vincere nollet; we fight not in earnest against our
corruptions, but either in show only, dallying, or faintly without any earnest
desire of revenge. Saint Aug. confess. l. 8. c. 7. In exordio adolescentiae
petieram chastitatem sed timebam ne me nimis cito audiret, and cito sanaret a
morbo concupiscentiae, quem malebam expleri quam extingui.
Austine before his thorough conversion prayed against fleshly lusts, but (as
he confesses with great anguish and sorrow of heart for his insincerity) so
aukwardly, and against his will, that secretly he desired that his lust should
rather be accomplished than extinguished. As it was then with him, so it is
with too many that take upon them the profession of Christians, and would
think it foul scorn to be taken for other than true converts. When the
voluptuous person offers a formal prayer to God, to extinguish the impure
flame of lust rising out of the cindars of original sin, Satan sets
before his fancy the picture of his beautiful Mistress; and as the Calor
ambiens, or outward heat in a body disposed to putrefaction, draws out the
natural heat; so this impure heat of lust draws out all the spiritual heat
of devotion, and so his faint prayer against sin is turned into sin. In
like manner while the covetous man prays against that base affection in his
soul, which ever desires that wherewith it is never Aristophan. in Plut.
(...). Sen. ep. 15. Si quid in his esset solidi, aliquando implerent, nunc
haurientium sitim concitant. Horat. carm. l. 2. od. 2. Crescit indulgens sibi
dirus hydrops, nec sitim pellit, nisi causa morbi fugerit venis, and aquosus
albocorpore languor.
satisfied, Mammon represents unto him the rising up of his heaps, and
swelling of his bags by his use-mony, whereby his heart is tickled, and so
his prayer also turns into sin. Thus all sinners that are not brought to a
perfect hatred and detestation of their bosom sin, even whilst they pray
against the forbidden fruit, hold it under their tongue, and their carnal
delights suffocate their godly sorrow.

Spiritual courage is most necessary, that is, confidence in God and in the
power of his might. This confidence is the immediate effect of a lively faith,
which S. John calls 1 John 5 4.
the victory of the world. When Christ bad Peter come to him walking on the
sea, upon the rising of a storm Peter's faith began to fail, and no sooner his
heart sanke in his body, but his feet also sanke in the water; even so when
any storm of persecution arises for the word, when we see our selves
encompassed on every side with dangers and terrors, and our faith fails, we
presently sink in despair, if Christ stretch not out his hand presently to
support us, and establish our heart in his promises.

3 Thirdly, constant perseverance is most needful; for though all virtues
run in the race of a Christian life, yet perseverance alone obtains the
garland. Suppose a ship to be fraught with rich merchandise, to have held a
prosperous course all the way, and escaped both rocks and Pirates, yet if it
be cast away in the haven, the owner is nothing the better for it, but loses
his goods, freight, and hope also. For this cause it is that in all the
promises in these letters of the hidden Manna, the white Stone, the water of
Life, the tree of Life, the crown of Life, etc. the only condition that is
expressed is perseverance. To him that overcommeth I will give, etc. for without
it faith is not faith, but a wavering opinion; hope is not hope, but a golden
dream; zeal is not zeal, but a sudden heat; joy but a flash, love but a
passion, temperance but a physic diet for a time, valor but a bravado,
patience but weak armor notable to hold out. All therefore who expect to eat
of the hidden Manna, and receive the white stone with the new name, must get
unto themselves, and put on the whole armor of God, and be daily trained in
Christ's school; and when they are called to join battle, out of an
exasperated hatred against the enemies of their soul, with great confidence
and courage fight against Satan and his temptations; the world and all the
sinful allurements in it; the flesh and the noisome lusts thereof,
strenuously, valiantly, and constantly, never putting off their armor till
they put off their bodies, nor quitting the field till they enter into the
celestial Canaan, whereof the terrestrial was a type; and what title the
Jews had to the one, we have to the other, not by purchase, but by promise:
yet as the recovery of that Land cost the Jews, so the recovery of this
costeth the Saints of God much sweat, and blood too sometimes; but neither that
sweat nor that blood is the price of the Land of Promise, but the Joh. 7.29.
blood of the immaculate Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world.
In which regard the Prophet Hos. 10.12.
Hosea, having exhorted the people to sow in righteousness, varieth the
phrase, and says not ye shall reap in righteousness, but, ye shall reap
in mercy. Why not reap in righteousness as well as sow in righteousness?
because man's righteousness is not answerable to Gods, and therefore he must
plead for his reward at the throne of mercy, not at the bar of justice. For
though the wages of sin is death, yet eternal life is the gift of God by
Jesus Christ: to whom be ascribed, etc.

THE HIDDEN MANNA. THE XXVI. SERMON.
APOC. 2.17. I will give to eat of the hidden Manna.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
IN the Old Testament we hear, Sic ait Jehovah, So says the Lord, God the
Father; in the Gospel, Thus spoke Jesus; but in this book for the most part,
Thus writes the Spirit; as in this verse. Wherein you are to observe, 1
Literam Spiritus, The letter of the Spirit. 2 Spiritum Literae, The Spirit of
the letter.
Or, to use rather the Allegory in the text, fix the eye of your
coonsideration upon 1 The golden Pot, the elegant and figurative expression. 2
The hidden Manna, the abstruse and spiritual meaning.


To him that overcommeth. He who bids us stand upon the highest staire,
consequently commands us to run up all the rest; so he that would have us
to overcome, implicitly comandeth us, 1. To have our names enrolled in our
Captains book: 2. To be trained in military exercise: 3 To follow our
General into the field: 4. To endure hardness, and inure our selves to
difficult labor: 5. When battle is joined to stand to our tacklings, and
acquit our selves like men; never giving over till we have, 1. repelled, next
chased, lastly discomfited and utterly destroyed our ghostly enemies: and when
we are in the hottest brunt, and most dreadful conflict of all, by faith to
look upon Christ holding out a crown from heaven unto us; and after we have
overcome in some great temptation, and seem to be at rest, to look upon the
labell of this crown, and there we shall find it written, Vincenti dabo, To
him that overcommeth indefinitely, not in one, but in all assaults of
temptation; not in one, but in all spiritual conflicts, till he have overcome
the last enemy, which is death. There are many, too many, in the militant
Church, who drink wine in bowls, and sing to the pipe and violl, and never
listen to Christ's alarm: others there are who hearing the alarm, desire to be
entertained in his service, and give their names unto him, but are not like
Timothy trained up in Martial discipline: a third sort like of training well
where there is little danger, but when they are to put themselves into the
field, like the children of Ephraim, turn back in the day of battle: lastly,
many like the ancient Gauls, begin furiously, but end cowardly; in the first
assault they are more than men, in the second less than women. None of these
shall taste of the hidden Manna, nor handle the white stone, nor read the new
name, but they who by a timely resolution give their names to Christ, by
private mortification, fasting, watching, and prayer, are trained for this
service, by faith grapple with their ghostly enemies, and by constancy hold out
to the end. For as Hannibal spoke sometime to his soldiers, Qui hostem vicerit
mihi erit Carthaginensis, he that conquereth his enemy, what country man
soever he be, he shall be unto me a Carthaginian, that is, I will hold him
for such, and give him the privilege of such an one: so Christ speaks here
to all that serve in his wars, He that overcommeth his enemy, of what
country or nation soever he be, I will make him free of the celestial
Jerusalem, I will naturalize him in my kingdom in heaven. In other kingdoms
there are several orders of Discourse, and l. origin. des ordores milit. p. 49.
Knights, as of Malta, of the Garter, of the Golden Fleece, of Saint John of
Jerusalem, of Saint Savior, of Saint James, of the holy Ghost, and diverse
others: but in the kingdom of Christ we find but one only sort, viz. the
order of Saint Vincents. In all other orders some have been found (...),
white-livered soldiers, or carpet-Knights, that either never drew sword, nor
saw battle, or basely fled from their colors: but of this order never any
either fled from his colors, or returned from battle without the spoils of
his ghostly enemies. He therefore that will be of this order must be of good
strength and courage, well armed continually, exercised in Martial discipline,
vigilant to take all advantages, inured to endure all hardness: to strength
he must add skill, to skill valor, to valor industry, to industry patience,
to patience constancy, and to all, humility; not to challenge the rewards here
proposed as due to his service, but only by virtue of the promise of him who
here says, To him that overcommeth

I will give. (...), not (...), I will render or repay: for it is not so in
this war as in others, wherein the soldier who carries himself valiantly
in war, and ventureth his life for his Prince and country, may challenge his
pay of desert; because we bear not our own armor, nor fight by our own
strength, nor conquer by our own valor, nor have any color for our service
on earth to pretend to a crown in heaven. In which regard though we may
expect, yet not challenge; look for, yet not sue for; desire, yet not require
as due the reward here promised. Luke 12.32.
Fear not little flock, says our Savior, for it is your fathers pleasure to
give you a kingdom; it is not his bargain to sell you it. Albeit the wages of
sin is death, and there we may plead merit: yet the Apostle teaches us that
eternal life is the gift of God. Upon which words Saint L. de great. and lib.
arbit. c. 9. Cum posset dicere, and recte dicere stipendium justitiae vita
aeterna, maluit dicere gratia autem vita aeterna, ut hinc intelligeremus non
pro meritis nostris Deum nos ad aeternam vitam, sed pro sua miseratione vocare,
unde dicitur in psalmo, coronat te in miseratione.
Austines observation is very remarkable; Whereas the Apostle might have
continued his Metaphor, and said, the wages of righteousness is eternal life,
because eternal life is the reward of righteousness, as death is of sin,
yet he purposely put the word gift in stead of wages, that we might learn
this most wholesome lesson, that God has predestined and called us to
eternal life, not for our merits, but of his mercy, according to those words
of the Psalmist, He crowns thee in compassion. If there be any merit, in S.
Bernards judgment, it is in denying all merit; Sufficit ad meritum scire quod
non sufficiant merita. And verily had the Church of Rome all faith, as her
proselytes suppose that she has all the good works, yet her standing upon
terms with God, and pleading merit, would mar all her merit, and justly fasten
upon her the ill name of Meretrix Babylonica, the whore of Babylon. For
Meretrix, says Calepine, a merendo sic dicta est, has her name from meriting.
When we have done all that we can, Luke 17.10.
Christ teaches us to say, we are unprofitable servants, we have done but
that which was our duty to do. Nay, have we done so much as we ought to do?
Venerable Bede, to check our pride who are apt to take upon us for the least
good work we do, tells us no; quod debuimus facere, non fecimus; we have not
done what was our duty to do: and if the best of us have not done what was our
duty to do, we merit nothing at our Masters hands but many stripes. Yet the
Church of Rome blusheth not to define it as a doctrine of faith in her
conventicle at Trent, that our Council. Trid. sess. 6. Can. 32. Si quis dixerit
hominis justificati bona opera ita esse dona Dei, ut non sint etiam bona ipsius
justificati merita, aut non vere merere augmentum gratiae and vitam aeternam,
anathema sit.
good works do truly merit eternal life. In which assertion, as Tertullian
spoke of venomous flowers, quot colores tot dolores, so many colors so many
dolours or mischiefs to man; so we may of the terms of this proposition,
quot verba tot haereses, so many words so many heresies: for

First, it is faith which intituleth us to heaven, not works, by grace we are
saved Ephesians. 2.8.9.
through faith, and that not of our selves: it is the gift of God: not of
works, lest any man should boast. Fides impetrat quod lex imperat, Faith
obtains that which the Law commands.

Secondly, if works had any share in our justification, yet we could not merit
by them, because as they are ours they are not good, as they are good they are
not ours but Gods, Phil. 2.13.
who works in us both the will and the deed: it is God which works in you
both to will and to do of his good pleasure: for 2 Cor. 3.5.
we are not sufficient of our selves to think any thing, as of our selves, but
our sufficiency is of God. Whence St. de lib. arbit. c. 7. Si bona sunt, Dei
dona sunt; si Dei dona sunt, non coronat Deus tanquam merita tua, sed tanquam
dona sua.
Austin strongly infers against all plea of man's merit, If thy works are
good they are Gods gifts, if they are evil God crowns them not; if therefore
God crowns thy works, he crowns them not as thy merits, but as his own
gifts.

Thirdly, the works that may challenge a reward as due unto them in strict
justice must be exactly and perfectly good, but such are not ours. 1 John 1.8.
For if we say that we have no sin, or that our best works are not some way
tainted, we deceive our selves, and there is no truth in us. Woe (says St.
Confess. l. 13. Vae hominum vitae laudabili, si remota misericordia discutias
eam.
Austine) to the commendable life of men, if thou examine it in rigor without
mercy. In which passionate strain he seems to take the note from Psalm. 130.3.
David: If thou Lord should mark iniquities, O Lord who should stand? and
he from Job 9.2.3.
Job; How should man be just before God? if he contend with him he cannot
answer one of a thousand.

Fourthly, were our works free from all aspersion of impurity and suspicion of
hypocrisy, yet could they not merit at Gods hands any thing, to whom we owe
all that we can or are, Dei omne est quod possumus, quod sumus. The greatest
Champion of merit Vasques the Jesuit, here yields the bucklers, because we can
give nothing to God which he may not exact of us by the right of his dominion:
we cannot merit any thing at his hand by way of justice. For Vasques in Thom.
disput. Non meremur in via justitiae, quia pro eo quod alteri redditranquam
debitum, nihil accipere quis debet: and ideo servi in^tiles dici possumus, quod
nihil quasi sponte Deo demus, sed demus ea quae in re dominii ex praecepto
exigere possit.
no man can demand any thing as his due for merely discharging his debt, no not
so much as thanks. Luke 17.9. Does he thank that servant because he did the
things that were commanded him? I trow not.

Fifthly, might our works taken at the best, merit something at Gods hands, yet
not eternal life. For there is no proportion between our finite works and
such an infinite reward: Aug. in Psalm. 36. Quid appendis cum infinito
quantumcunque finitum?
no finite thing, be it never so great, can Ber. sermon. in annunciat. Quid sunt
merita ad tantam gloriam?
weigh down that which is infinite.

That our works may bear scale in the Sanctuary, and poyse the reward, five
grains must be added to them: 1 Propriety. 2 Liberty. 3 Utility. 4 Perfection.
5 Proportion.


First, propriety: we can merit by nothing that is not our own work, no more
than we can oblige a man to us by repaying him his own coin. Certainly that
which is not our work is not our merit.

Secondly, liberty: we can challenge nothing by way of merit for a work,
which we are engaged by duty to perform, no more than oblige a man to us for
discharging a bond, which we were bound under a great penalty by a precise day
to satisfy.

Thirdly, utility or profit: if that we do to another no way advantage him,
if he be no whit the better by it, what color have we to exact, or reason to
expect a reward from him for such a work?

Fourthly, perfection: unless a work be done sufficiently, the labourer
cannot in justice demand his hire, nor the workman require his price.

Fifthly, proportion: no labor or work can merit more than in true estimation
it is worth: the labourer deserves his hire, such a hire as is correspondent
to his pains, but no other. He that labors but a day, deserves not two
days, much less a week, or a months hire.

If the plea of merit is overthrown by the defect of any one of these
conditions, how much more by the defect of all? 1. If we have no interest in
the work, be it never so meritorious in it self, we cannot merit by it,
because it is not ours. 2. Let it be ours, and meritorious in another that
were not bound to perform it, yet weee cannot merit by it if we are any way
obliged in duty to perform it, because it is not free. 3. Let the work be
free, yet if what we do no way redound to his benefit from whom we expect a
reward, we cannot justly demand any recompense from him, because our work is
not profitable to him. 4. Let the work be profitable, yet if it be not done
as it should be in every circumstance, we cannot sue for the price agreed
upon, because the work is not perfect. 5. Let the work be perfect and exact,
yet we can exact no more for it than the skill, or the pains together with
the materials deserve. Press we each of these circumstances, and much more if
we press them all together, they will yield the doctrine of Saint Basil. in
psalm. 114. (...).
Basil upon the 114. Psalm: There remains a rest eternal for them who here
strive lawfully, not according to the merit of works, but according to the
grace of our most bountiful God. Let us once more squeze them.

First, a meritorious act must be our own, if we have any expectance for it;
these we call ours are not so: By the grace of God, says the Apostle, I am
that I am: and his grace in me was not in vain: But I labored more than they
all, yet not I, but the 1 Cor. 15.10.
grace of God which was with me. And this the Propht Esaias 26.12.
Esaias professes in his prayer to God; Lord thou will ordain peace for us: for
thou also have wrought all our works in us. If these texts are not clear
enough, the Apostles question is able to nonplus all the Pelagians in the
world: 1 Cor. 4.7.
Who makes thee to differ from another? and what have thou that thou have not
received? There is no good work which is not comprised within the will or the
deed, and both, as we heard before, are the work of grace in us. Upon this
firm ground Saint In psalm. 102. Si de tuo retribuis peccatum retribuis, omnia
enim quae habes ab illo habes; tuum solum peccatum habes. Enchirid. ad Laur. c.
302. Ideo dictum intelligitur, non est volentis, neque currentis, sed
miserentis Dei, ut totum Deo detur, qui hominis voluntatem bonam and praeparat
ad juvandam, and adjuvat praeparatam.
Austine builds a strong fort for grace against man's merit: If thou renderest
any thing to God of thine own, thou renderest sin; for all the good thou
have, thou have received from God: thou have nothing which thou may call
thine own but sin: And elsewhere when the Apostle says, It is not of him
that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that has mercy; we are thus
to understand him, That we ought to ascribe the whole unto God, who both
prepares the will of man to be helped, and helps it being prepared.

Secondly, a meritorious act must be free, in our power, and at our choice to
do or leave undone; our works are not so: for when Luke 17.10.
we have done all that we can, we are commanded to say we are unprofitable
servants, we have done that which it was our duty do. This wedge Marcus the
Tract. de iis qui putant ex operibus justificari. c. 2. (...).
Hermit drives in forcibly: The Lord, says he, willing to show that all the
commandments are of duty to be performed, and that the adoption of children is
freely given to man by his blood, says, when ye have done all things that are
commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants, etc. therefore the kingdom
of heaven is not the hire of works, but a gift of the Lord prepared for his
faithful servants.

Thirdly, a meritorious work must be of use, and some way beneficial to him
of whom a reward in strict justice is demanded; ours are not so: for Psalm. 16.2.
our goodness extends not unto God, he is far above it. This nail Saint
L 10. de civ. Dei, c 5. Totum hoc quod recte colitur, Deus credendum est homini
prodesse, non Deo, neque enim fonti se quisquam dixerit profuisse quod biberit.
Austine excellently fasteneth: If we serve and worship God as we ought, the
whole benefit thereof accrueth to our selves, and not unto God: for no man will
say that the fountain gains any thing by our drinking of it, etc.

Fourthly, a meritorious act must be complete, perfect, and without exception;
ours are not so: for Vide Plat. in dial. Euthyph.
Romans 8.26.
we cannot pray as we ought, and our very best actions are so stained, that
the Prophet Esaias calls them no better than Esaias 64.6. But we are all as an
unclean thing, and all our righteousness is as filthy rags.
filthy rags or menstruous clouts. This arrow Saint Moral. in Job. l. 5. c.
7. Ipsa justitia nostra, si ad examen justitiae divinae deducatur, injustitia
est; and sordet in districtione judicis quod in aestimatione fulget operantis.
Gregory drives to the head: Our very righteousness, if it be scanned by the
rule of divine justice, will prove injustice; and that will appear foul and
sordid in the strict scanning of the Judge, which shines and seems most
beautiful in the eye of the worker.

Fifthly, a meritorious work must hold some good correspondency and equivalence
with the reward; ours do not so: for if we might offer to put any work in
the balance, certainly our sufferings for Christ's sake; but these are too
light, yea so far too light, Romans 8.18.
that they are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us. Upon this anvile Saint In ep. ad Col. Hom. 2. (...). Idem in
psalm. 4. (...).
Chrysostom forms a steel weapon; No man shows such a conversation of
life that he may be worthy of the kingdom, but this is wholly of the gift of
God; and although we should do innumerable good^ deeds, it is of Gods pity
and mercy that we are heard; although we should come to the very top of
virtue, it is of mercy that we are saved: And Ansel. de mensurat. crucis. Si
homo mill annis serviret Deo ferventissime, non mereretur ex condigno dimidium
diei esse in coelo.
Anselme steepeth it in oil; If a man should serve God most devoutly a
thousand years, he should not deserve to be half a day in heaven. What have
our adversaries to say to these things? what does the learned Cardinal, whose
name breathes Bella, Arma, Minae.
Wars, Arms, and Threats? here he turns Penelope, texit telam and retexit,
he does and undoes, he sewes and ravels: after many large books written for
merit, in the end Quae dederat repetit, funemque reducit; he dasheth all with
his pen at once, saying, Tutissimum est, it is the safest way to place all our
confidence only in Gods mercy, that is, to renounce all merit. Now in a case
so nearly concerning our eternal happiness or misery, he that will not take
the safest course, needs not to be confuted, but either to be pitied for his
folly, or cured of his frenzy. To conclude this point of difference; the
conclusion of all things is near at hand: well may men argue with men here
below the matter of merit, but, as St. Ep 29. Cum rex justus sederet in throno
suo, quis gloriabitur se mundum habere cor? quae igitur spes veniae, nisi
misericordia superexultet justitiam?
Austine feelingly speaks of this point, When the righteous judge (from whose
face heaven and earth fled away) shall sit upon his throne; who will then dare
say my heart is clean? nay what hope for any man to be saved, if mercy at that
day get not the upper hand of justice? I need plead no more for this (Dabo) in
my text; if it plead not for us at that day, we shall never eat of the Manna
promised, but it shall be for ever hidden from us. I will give

To eat. The sight of Manna, which the Psalmist calls Angels food, especially
of the hidden Manna, which by Gods appointment was reserved in a golden pot,
had been a singular favor; but the taste thereof is a far greater. The
contemplation of celestial objects is delightful, but the fruition of them
much more. Even of earthly beauties the sight is not so great contentment as
the enjoying, neither is any man so affected with delight at the view of a rich
cabinet of jewels, as at the receiving any one of them for his own. Now so it
is in celestial treasures and delights; through Gods bounty and abundant
goodness unto us we own what we see, and we taste what we touch, and we feel
what we believed, and we possess what we have heard, and our heart enters
into those joys in heaven, which never entered into the heart of man on earth.
In which respect the Psalmist breaks out into that passionate invitation;
Psalm. 34.8.
O taste and see how gracious the Lord is: and S. Paul into that fervent
prayer; Phil. 1.9.
And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and
in all sense, (...): and Saint Confess. l. 6. c. 10. Te lucem, vocem, cibum, and
amplexum interioris hominis mei, etc. ubi fulget animae quod non capit locus,
and ubi sonat quod non rapit tempus, and ubi olet quod non spargit flatus, and
ubi sapit quod non minuit edacitas, and ubi haeret quod non divellit satietas.
Austine in that heavenly meditation; O let me enjoy thee, the light, the
sound, the food, the love and embracement of my inward man; thou art light to
the eye, music to the ear, sweet meats to the taste, and most delightful
embracings to the touch of my soul: in thee that shines to my soul which no
place comprehends; and that sounds which no time measures, or snatcheth
away; and that smells which no blast dissipateth; and that relisheth which no
feeding upon diminishes; and that adhereth which no satiety can pluck away.
When therefore the ancients define celestial happiness to be the beatificall
vision of God, grounding themselves especially upon these texts of scripture:
Mat. 5.8. Psalm. 27.8.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God, and seek his face
evermore. My heart said unto thee, thy face Lord will I seek; and, Psalm. 17.15.
I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake,
with thy likeness. And, 1 Cor. 13.12
Now we see through a glass, darkely, but then face to face; we are to
understand these speeches by a figure called Synecdoche, wherein a part is put
for the whole: for certainly there is a heaven in the will and in the
affections, as well as in the understanding. God has enriched the soul with
many faculties, and in all of them has kindled manifold desires; the heat
whereof, though it may be allayed for a time with the delights and comforts
which this life affords, yet it can never be quenched but by himself who
made the hearth, and kindled these fires in it. As the contemplation of God is
the understandings happiness, so the adhering to him is the wills; the
recounting of his blessings, the memories; the embracing him, the affections;
and generally the fruition of him in all parts and faculties, the felicity of
the whole man. To apply this observation to the words in my text: When the
dispensers of the mysteries of salvation open the scriptures, they set before
us heavenly treasure, they point unto, and show us the golden pots of Manna:
but when by the hand of faith we receive Gods promises, and are enriched by the
graces of the spirit, then we own the pearls of the Gospel. To hear one who
has the tongue of the learned discourse of the work of grace, enlightening the
mind, regenerating the heart, rectifying the will, moderating the desires,
quieting the affections, and filling the soul with unspeakable joy, is a great
delight to us; yet nothing to that we take when we feel grace working upon our
souls, and producing all these divine effects within us. When we read in holy
Scriptures what are the privileges of the sons of God, we see the hidden
Manna; but when the Romans 8.16.17.
Spirit testifies to our spirit that we are the sons of God; and if sons
then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ: then we eat

The hidden Manna. Some take the hidden Manna in my text for the mysteries of
the Gospel, others for the secret virtues of the Sacraments. Primasius in Apoc.
Christus factus est homo, ut panem Angelorum comederet homo.
Primasius for Christ himself, who, as he says, was made man that man might
eat Manna the food of Angels: Pererius for incomparable sweetness in the
contemplation of heavenly things: Cornelius a Lapide for spiritual comforts
after temptations: all in general speak to good purpose. But if you demand of
me in particular, what is this hidden Manna; I must answer as Cato did when one
asked him what he carried so fast locked up in a chest: It is locked up (says
he) that thou should not look into it nor know. I cannot tell you what it
is, because it is hidden: only this is open and manifest in the Scriptures,
that in the Word, the Sacraments, Prayer and Meditation, the Elect of God find
hidden Manna, that spiritual sweetness which may be compared unto, or rather
preferred before the relish of Manna to the corporal taste. And what St.
Cyprian speaks of the work of grace in our conversion, Sentitur priusquam
dicitur, it is felt before it can be uttered, may be applied to this hidden
Manna, gustatur priusquam dicitur, no tongue can speak of it worthily that
has not tasted it: as Psalm. 119.103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste
(...) they are sweeter than honey to my mouth.
David did, who prefers it before the honey and the hony-combe. And St. Aug.
confess. l. 9. c. 1. O quam suave mihi repent fuit carere mundi suavitatibus
and quas amittere metus fuit am dimittere gaudium crat: tu enim pro^^s intra^as
omni voluptate dulcior.
Austine, O what pleasure took I in abandoning all worldly pleasure! for thou,
O Lord, enteredst into me for them sweeter than any pleasure. And St. Jerome,
who calls God to witness that sometimes he found heaven upon earth, and in
his spiritual elevations and raptures thought that he communed with quieres
of Angels. And St. St. Ephesians. Domine recede a me parumper, quia vasis infirmitas
far non potest.
Ephraim, who was so over-filled with joy in the Holy Ghost that he made a
strange prayer; O Lord for a little while depart from me, and restrain the
influence of spiritual joy, lest the vessel break. And St. Mihi hae pruna
rosae videntur. Citat Cornelius a lap Comment.
Tiburtius, whose inward joys and spiritual raptures so drowned his bodily
tortures, that when he trod upon live coals he cried out, saying, These live
coals seem to me no other than red roses. The scholars of Pythagoras believed
that the celestial bodies by their regular motions caused an harmonicall
sound, and made admirable music, though neither he nor any other ever heard
it: and shall not we believe that there is hidden Manna, though we never tasted
it, if not upon the report of these Saints who spoke of their own sense and
experience, yet upon the credit of him who both promises to give this hidden
Manna, and is it himself? John 6.51.
I am the living bread which came down from heaven.

Christ and his word retain not only the name of Manna, but the chief
qualities and properties thereof.

First, Manna rained from the skies; Christ and his word came from heaven.

Secondly, Manna had a most sweet yet a new and strange taste, so has the
word; it is sweeter than honey to the spiritual taste, though the carnal man
like better of the flesh pots of Egypt than of it.

Thirdly, Manna relished according to the stomachs of them that ate it, and
answered all appetites: so the word of God is milk to children, and strong
meat to men.

Fourthly, Manna erat cibus reficiens and nunquam deficiens, the children of
Israel fed on Manna in the wilderness till they entered into the earthly
Canaan: in like manner the Word and Sacraments are our spiritual food till we
arrive at the celestial Canaan.

Fifthly, Manna was eaten by it self without any other meat or sauce added to
it: the word of God must not be mingled with human traditions and inventions.
They who go about to sweeten it with such spices mar the taste of it, and may
more justly be taxed than that King of Persia was by Antalcidas, who by pouring
ointment upon a garland of roses corrupted the natural smell and fragrancie
thereof by the adulterors sophistication of art.

Sixthly, some portion of the Manna was laid up in the Arc, and kept in a
golden pot for aftertimes; and part of the mysteries of holy Scripture are
reserved for us till we come to heaven: and in regard of such truths as are
not ordinarily revealed in this life, some conceive the word to be here termed

Hidden Manna. Howbeit, we need not restrain the words to those abstruse
mysteries, the declaration whereof shall be a part of our celestial
happiness: for the whole doctrine of the Gospel may in a true sense be called
hidden Manna, because it contains in it Sapientiam Dei in mysterio, the
wisdom of God 1 Cor. 2.7.
hidden in a mystery. For albeit the sound of the word is gone into all the
world, yet the harmony in it is not observed by all. The chapters and verses
of the Scripture are generally known, but not all the contents. He that saw
the outside of Solomon's tents could not guess at the royalty of that Prince:
but he that entered in, and took a particular view and inventory of his precious
furniture, rich hangings, massy plate, full coffers, orient jewels, and
glittering apparel, might make a good estimate thereof. A blind man from his
birth, though he may hear of the Sun, and discourse of his golden rays from
the mouth of others, yet can he not possibly conceive what delight the seeing
eye takes in beholding that glorious brouch of heaven, and Prince of the
stars. When we hear the last will of a rich man read unto us, which we
believe little concerns us, though it be never so well penned or copied out,
it little affects us: but if we have certain notice that by it some great
legacy in lands or money is bequeathed unto us, then we hearken to it with
thirsty ears, and as curiously observe every line and syllable therein as
Jewellers do every carrat in a Diamond. Such is the difference between the
carnal and the spiritual man's apprehension and affection in the reading and
hearing of the written word: the letters and points are not hidden to any that
can read, but the treasures of wisdom and knowledge laid up in it, the power
and efficacy of it, the price and value of it is hidden to all those Acts 16.14.
whose heart God opens not as he did the heart of Lidia. And if the Manna of
the word be thus hidden, how much more the Manna of the Spirit, I mean the
inward comforts and joys of the 1 Pet. 3.4.
bidden man of the heart? Plutarch. de tranquil. animae (...),
Diogenes the Philosopher bid every day holy in a good man's calendar: turn
Diogenes his good man into a regenerate Christian, and his Philosophy will
prove good Divinity. For to a sanctified soul every day is holy, on which he
keeps a great feast, the Pro. 15.15.
feast of a good conscience; at which the principal service is the hidden Manna
in my text. In the fields of Solinus polyhist. Campus Ennensis semper in
floribus est and omni vernus die.
Enna in Sicily there is a continual spring, and flowers all the year: so are
there in the mind of a faithful Christian, it is spring there all the year:
and though he has not always the sense and smelling, because sometimes his
spiritual nostrils are stuffed with earthly cares and worldly comforts, yet he
has always within him the sent of the flowers of Paradise. I grant there is a
time to rejoice, and a time also to weep: and I acknowledge that the devoutest
man upon earth, who is most ravished with divine contemplation, yet does not
always actually rejoice, that is, apprehend or express his joy: yet as St.
Pros. de vit. contemplat. l. 1. Non potest defraudari delectationibus cui
Christus est gaudium, quia bono delectatur aeterno.
Prosper soundly argues, He can never be without joy and comfort, whose joy is
Christ, because the fuel of this sacred flame is eternal. Though the earth be
sometimes, as now it is beyond the seas, full of darkness and cruel
habitations, yet there is still Psalm. 97.11. Light is sown for the righteous,
and gladness for the upright in heart.
light in Goshen, in the conscience of a righteous man.

Light is as it were the joy of the sky, and joy is the light of the mind:
now as lights, so joys are of two sorts: 1 Purer and finer: 2 Impurer and
grosser.


The purer lights burn clearer, last longer, and leave a sweeter savor
behind them: the grosser and impurer burn dimly, spend fast, running into
gutters, and go out with an ill favor. You may observe the like difference
between carnal and spiritual joys; carnal delights that are fed with
impure matter, such as are the lusts of the flesh, and the lusts of the eye,

1. Burn dimly, they yield no clear light of comfort to the mind, they are
mixed joys, and insincere; Medio de font leporum surgit amarum aliquid.

2. They spend fast, and are quickly over. Seneca rightly observes, Voluptas
cum accenditur extinguitur. Ita quibus delectatur vulgus, tennem habent ac
perfusoriam voluptatem, and quodeunque invectitium gaudium est, fundamento
caret. Sen. ep. 23. In praecipiti est voluptas, ad dolorem vergit, nisi modum
teneat.
That pleasure is quenched in the kindling of it, much like dry thorns under a
pot, which make a blaze, and suddenly are turned into ashes. In which regard
the Romans set up the image of Angerona the goddess of anguish and sorrow, in
the Temple of Volupia, the Goddess of pleasure, to show that pain treads
upon the heel of pleasure, and anguish of mirth.

3. They go out with a stink; they leave behind them amara and foeda
vestigia, as Saint Bernard speaks, a bitter fume, and noisome stench in our
consciences, and a foul print upon our name. But spiritual joys on the
contrary,

1. Burn clearly, send forth a bright flame; for these joys are sincere,
exceeding unspeakable and glorious.

2. They last long; for they are, as Saint Austine calls them, Sen. ep. 23.
Hoc ad quod te conor perducere, solidum est, and quod plus pateat introrsus,
etc.
fortes delitiae, and solida gaudia, during delights, and solid joys.

3. They leave a sweet savor behind them; a good report in the world, and a
sweet contentment in the soul. For they are Solomon's Pro. 16.24.
Dulcedo animae, David's Psalm. 45.7.
Oleum laetitiae, Saint Paul's 2 Cor. 2.16.
Odor suavitatis, and S. John's Manna reconditum, sweet to the soul, and health
to the bones, the oil of gladness, the savor of life, the hidden Manna: O
felix and paucis nota voluptas! The world is all set upon a merry pin, though
God knows there is little cause; we are all for pleasure, but it is a pain to
a righteous soul to think what pleasure, it is grief to name what joy. In
Pontus there is a flower called Rodo-dendrum, of which the honey that is made
is rank poison; such is the sensual delight that is taken in the use, or
rather the abuse of worldly pleasures; it distempereth the taste, and poysoneth
the soul. Not to forsake the Metaphor in my text; all inordinate pleasures,
immoderate joys, and impure delights are like the Manna that was gathered on
the Sabbath day, which corrupted suddenly, and became full of worms: but pure
and spiritual joys are like that Manna, which Moses by Gods appointment laid
up in a golden pot, which corrupted not, but preserved it self from
putrefaction, and the gold also from rust; the lid or cover of which pot I will
endeavor to open a little wider, that you may have yet a fuller sight and
quicker taste of the hidden Manna.

There are three kinds of the hidden Manna: 1 Of the Word: 2 Of the Sacrament:
3 Of the Spirit.


1 The Manna of the Word is that delight which is taken by the hearers in the
opening the mysteries of holy Scripture, and applying the sweet comforts of the
Gospel to the conscience: and this Ep. ad Hier.
Damasus conceived to be the greatest happiness in the world.

2. The Manna of the Sacrament is that comfort which the worthy receivers feel
in themselves, after the sanctified use of the elements, by growth in grace,
and increase of spiritual strength: and of this Saint Ep. l. 2.
Cyprian was as it were in travel, till he was delivered of it in his Epistle
to Cornelius.

3. The Manna of the Spirit is that unspeakable joy, wherewith the heart is
filled, and even leapeth and danceth within us, when we hear the Spirit
testifying unto our spirits that we are the sons of God. Precious metals are
dug out of the bowels of the earth, and pearls are found in the bottom of
the sea; and truly seldom shall we fall upon this treasure of spiritual joy,
and pearl of the Gospel, but in the depth of godly sorrow, and bottom and
lowest point of our humiliation before God.

1. The first taste we have of the hidden Manna of the Spirit, is in the
beginning of our conversion, and nonage of our spiritual life; when after
unutterable remorse, sorrow, and fear, arising from the apprehension of the
corruption, and guilt of our natural estate, and a dreadful expectation of
wrath laid up for us against the day of wrath, and everlasting weeping,
howling, and gnashing of teeth with the damned in hell; we on the sudden see
a glympse of Gods countenance shining on us, and by faith, though yet weak,
hope for a perfect reconciliation to him.

2. A second taste we have, when we sensibly perceive the Spirit of grace
working upon our heart, thawing it, as it were, and melting it into godly
sorrow, and after enflaming it with an everlasting love of him, who by his
infinite torments and unconceivable sorrows, has purchased unto us eternal
joys.

3. A third taste we have of it, when after a long fight with our natural
corruptions, we meet with the Devils Lieutenant, the sin that reigns in
us, which the Scripture calls the plague of the heart; that vice to which
either the temper of our body, or our age, or condition of life enclineth us
unto; our bosom abomination, to which for a long time we have enthralled our
selves, and having perfectly discovered it by employing the whole armor of God
against it, in the end we get the victory of it.

4. A fourth taste we have after some heavy cross, or long sickness, when
God delivers us above hope, and sanctifies our affliction unto us, and by
his Spirit calls to our remembrance all his goodness to us from our
childhood, and anointeth our eyes with eye salve, that we may see the manifold
fruits of the cross, and find in our selves with David, that it was good for
us thus to be afflicted.

5. A fifth taste we have at some extafie in our life, or a trance at our
death, when we are rapt up, as it were, into the third heaven with St. Paul,
and see those things that eye never saw, and hear words that cannot be
uttered. Thus have I opened unto you five springs of the waters of comfort; in
which after you have stripped your selves of wordly cares, and earthly delights,
you may bathe your souls: in the bottom whereof you may see the white stone,
which Christ promises to him that overcommeth, saying, To him that overcommeth
I will give to eat of the hidden Manna: To whom, etc.

THE WHITE STONE. THE XXVII. SERMON.
APOC. 2.17. And I will give him a white stone.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
IT was the manner of the Thracians to reckon up all the happy days of their
life, and mark them in a book or table with a white stone: whereunto the Poet
alluding says, Pers. satyr.
Hunc Macrine diem numera meliore lapillo.

May it please God by his Spirit to imprint those mysteries in your hearts,
which are engraven upon this stone, I doubt not but this day, in which I am to
describe unto you the nature of it, will prove so happy, that it shall deserve
to be scored up with the like stone. For this white stone is a certain token
and pledge of present remission of sins, and future admission into Christ's
kingdom. Whereof through divine assistance, by your wonted patience, I will
speak at large; after I have refreshed the characters in your memory of my
former observations upon this Scripture, which sets before all that overcome
in the threefold christian war, 1 Foreign, against Satan. Recapitulat.
2 Civil, against the world. 3 Servile, against fleshly lusts; three boones or
special gifts: 1 Hidden Manna, a type of spiritual consolation. 2 A white
stone, the emblem of justification. 3 A new name, the imprese of glorification.



There is 1 Sweetness in the hidden Manna. 2 Comfort in the white stone. 3
Glory in the new name.


The sweetness of the hidden Manna we tasted, 1 In the mystical meaning of
the Word. 2 In the secret power of the Sacrament. 3 In the unutterable comfort
of the Spirit. And now I am to deliver unto you in the next place the white
stone.


In the handling whereof, I will level at those three scientificall questions
mentioned by Aristot. analyt. post l. 2. c. 1. (...). Notand quod sit referti
ad an sit, ubi de accidente quaeritur, quia accidentis esse est mess.
Aristotle in his books of demonstration. Divis.
(...), An sit, aut quod sit. (...), Quid sit. (...), Propter quod sit.


First, whether there be any such white stone.

Secondly, what it is.

Thirdly, to what end it is given, and what use we are to make of it for our
instruction, correction, or comfort.

First, of the An sit, (...), whether there be any such stone or no. There has
been for many ages, a great question De lapide Philosophico, of the
Philosophers stone, to which they ascribe a rare virtue to turn baser metals
into gold: but there is no question at all among the sincere professors of the
Gospel, De lapide theologico, of the divine stone in my text, which yet is far
more worth, and of greater virtue than that. For that (if we have any faith in
Alchymy) after much labor, and infinite cost, will turn base metal into
gold; but this will undoubtedly turn penitent tears into pearl, and drops of
blood shed for the testimony of the Gospel, into rubies and hematites to beset
our crown of glory. With this stone, as a special love-token, Christ assures
his dearest spouse, that Romans 8.28.
all things shall turn to her good, and work together for her endless
happiness. He that has this white stone, shall by the eye of faith see it
suddenly turn all temporal losses into spiritual advantages, all crosses
into blessings, all afflictions into comforts. What though some heretics or
profane persons have no belief of this white stone, no more than they have of
that Mat. 13.46.
pearl of great price, which the Merchant sold all that he had to buy? What
though some have been abused by counterfeit stones like to this? shall we not
therefore regard this, or seek after it? This were all one as if an expert
Goldsmiths should refuse to look after pure gold, because some ignorant
Merchant has been cheated with sophisticated alchymie stuff for gold: or if
a skillful Jeweller should offer nothing for an orient Diamond, because an
unskilful Lapidary has been corisened with a Cornish or Bristow stone in
stead of it. The mistaking of any other man should not take off the edge of our
desires to gain an invaluable jewel, but whet our diligence the more, to
observe more accurately the notes of difference between the true and
counterfeit stone, upon which I shall touch anon, after I have convinced our
Romish skeptics, by evidence from the nature of faith, the profession of Gods
Saints, the testimony of the Spirit, and undeniable signs and effects, that
all that are called by the word effectually, have this white stone in my text
given unto them, whereby they are assured of their present estate of grace, and
future of glory.

Tit. 1.1.
Elect is not a bare assent to supernatural verities revealed in Scripture,
which may be in a Reprobate, and is in the Jam. 2.19.
Devils themselves: Thou beleevest there is one God, thou do well, the
Devils also believe and tremble: but a divine grace, whereby being fully
assured of Gods favor to us, we trust him with our souls, and wholly rely on
him for salvation, through the merits of his son. The sure promises of the
Gospel are like a strong cable, let down to a man in a deep pit or dungeon,
on which he does not only lay hand by faith, but hangs and rests himself
upon it, and thereby is drawn out of darkness, to see and possess the
inheritance of the Saints in light. To believe the communion of Saints, is not
only to be persuaded that there is a communion of Saints in the world,
remission of sins in the Church, resurrection of the flesh at the last day,
and life everlasting in heaven: but to be assured by faith, that we have an
interest in this communion, benefit by this remission, and shall partake the
glory of this resurrection, and the happiness of life everlasting. They who
had been stung by fiery serpents, and were healed by looking upon the brazen
serpent, did not only believe that it had cured many, but that it would cure
them. Here the Logicians rule holds, Medicina curat Socratem, non hominem;
physic is not given to man's nature to cure the species, but to every man in
individuo to heal his person: and to every sick soul that applies unto it
self the promises of the Gospel, Christ says, Mat. 9.22.29
Be it unto thee as thou beleevest, thy faith has made thee whole, go in
peace. Hereupon Saint Fides dicit; aeternabona reposita sunt; spes dicit, mihi
teposita sunt; charitas dicit, ego curro post ea.
Bernard brings in the three divine graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity, singing
as it were a catch, and taking the word one from another; Faith begins,
saying, everlasting treasures are laid up in heaven; Hope follows, saying,
they are laid up for me; Charity concludes, I will seek after them. And
verily no man by a general Romish credulity, but by a special faith in
Christ, can say with Job, My redeemer; with David, My salvation; with the
Spouse, My beloved, with the blessed Virgin, My Savior; with Thomas, My Lord
and my God: much less can he warrant these possessives with a scio; Job
19.25.26.27.
I know that my Redeemer lives, and that I shall see him stand up at the last
day upon the earth: and though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet
in my flesh I shall see God: whom I shall see for my self. And, Psalm. 45.11.12.
I know that thou favourest me, thou upholdest me in my integrity, and fettest
me before thy face for ever. And, Romans 8.28.
We know that all things work for the best to them that love God. We know
that when 2 Cor. 5.1.
our earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we shall have an eternal in the
heavens. 1 John 2.5.
We know that we are translated from death to life, because we love the
brethren. Opinion and science, a conjecturall hope and an assured belief, as
much differ as a shaken reed and a well grown oak, which no wind can stir.

To know any thing, says L. 1 posterior c. 2. Scire est causam rei cognoscere,
and quod illius causa sit, and quod res illa aliter se habere non posset.
Aristotle, is to know the cause, and that this cause is the cause of such an
effect, and that the thing it self cannot be otherwise than we conceive of
it: in which regard the Greek Etymologist deriveth (...), because opinion
waggeth and inclines the mind by probabilities on both sides; but science
fasteneth it, and makes it stand unmovable.

With these texts of scripture, attributing knowledge of salvation to all
believers, our Trent Merchants are manifestly gravelled, and stick in the mud:
yet they endeavor to boy up their sunk vessel by a distinction of a double
knowledge, 1 By common faith. 2 By special revelation.
They yield that some, who have been admitted to Gods privy Council by
special revelation, have been assured of their crown of glory; but they will
by no means grant that believers can attain to this certainty by their common
faith: yet such is the clearness of the texts above alleged, for the point in
question, that they easily, like the beams of the sun, break through this
popish mist. For Job speaks not of any special secret revealed unto him, but
of the common article of all our faith, concerning the resurrection of the
flesh; I know that my Redeemer lives, and he shall stand up, and I shall see
him with these eyes. And what David speaks of his knowledge of Gods favor,
and steadfast belief of his future happiness, Ad Monim. l. 1. ^ustus ex fide
vivens, fiducialiter dicit, credo videre bona domini in terra viventium.
Fulgentius applies to every believer; The just man living by faith, speaks
confidently, I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land
of the living. And S. John ascribes this knowledge, not to any singular
revelation, but to charity, the common effect of faith: We know that we are
passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: whereupon S. Tract. 5.
in ep. Joh. Nemo interroget hominem, redeat ad cor suum, si ibi invenerit
charitatem, securus sit, quia transiit a morte ad vitam.
Austin gives this sage advice; Let no man enquire of man, let him have
recourse to his own heart; if he find there charity, let him rest assured that
he is passed from death to life. And S. Paul joyneth all the faithful with
him, saying, We know that all things work for the best to them that love God:
and, There is laid up a crown of righteousness, which the righteous Judge
shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but to all them also that
love his appearing. In like manner Saint Ep. ex regist. l. 6. Hac fulti
certitudine, de ejusdem redemptoris nostri misericordia nihil ambigere, sed spe
debemus indubitata praesumere.
Gregory impropriateth not this assurance to himself, or some few to whom God
extraordinarily reveals their state hereafter, but extends it to all,
making it a common duty, not a special gift; saying, Being supported with this
certainty, we ought nothing to doubt of the mercy of our Redeemer, but be
confident thereof, out of an assured hope. By the coherence of the text in the
eighth to the Romans, we may infallibly gather, that all that walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit, and have received the first fruits thereof,
and the testimony within themselves, are the Sons of God, know that all
things work together for their good. Have we not all received the spirit of
adoption? do we not come to God as children to a most loving father? do we
not daily, in confidence of his love, cry, Abba Father? If so, then the Apostle
adds farther, that the Spirit testifies to our spirit, that we are the
sons of God. And lest any heretical doubt cast in might trouble the spring
of everlasting comfort, as if we were indeed made sons for the present, but
might forfeit our adoption, and thereby lose our inheritance, the Apostle
clears all in the words following ( v. 17.) If sons, then heirs, heirs of
God, and joint heirs with Christ. God adopteth no son whom he intends not
to make his heir, neither can any that is borne of him cease to be his son,
because the 1 Pet. 1.23. Being borne again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible.
seed of which he is borne is incorruptible, and this seed still remains in
him. 1 John 3.9. Whosoever is borne of God does not commit sin, for his seed
remains in him. There are three means of assurance among men: 1 Earnests. 2
Seals. 3 Witnesses.
In bargains earnests, in deeds seals, in trialls witnesses.

First, to secure sums of money or bargains we take earnests of men, or some
pledge: behold this security given us by God, even the 2 Cor. 1.22.
earnest of his Spirit in our hearts. On which words St. Chrysostom. in secund.
ad Cor. hom. l. 3. (...).
Chrysostom thus plainly glosseth, He says not the Spirit, but the earnest
of the Spirit, that thou may be every way confident: for if he meant not to
give thee the whole, he would never have given this earnest in present. For
this had been to lose his earnest, and cast it away in vain.

Secondly, to confirm all grants, licenses, bonds, leases, testaments and
conveyances, seals are required: behold this confirmation also, Ephesians. 1.13.
In whom ye are sealed by that holy Spirit of promise. and 4.30. And grieve not
the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption. Whether
we speak of the seal sealing, or the seal sealed, we have both. For we are
sealed by the Spirit of grace as by the seal sealing, and by the grace of the
Spirit as the seal sealed, that is, printed upon us. In reference to which
place Daniel Chamierus de fid. l. 10. c. 13. Sigillorum varii sunt gradus: alia
simpliciter ad rei pertinent certitudinem indefinite; sic Reges sigillis suis
muniunt diplomata, sic contrahentes sigillis schedam suam muniunt: sed alia
spectant personae certitudinem quae obsignari dicitur, id est, signo peculiari
insigniri, ut eo sciat se in numerum eorum ascriptum ad quos tale aliquod jus
pertinet, ut cum Rex Equitibus suis torques concedit, ut procerto habeat se
Equites esse.
Chamierus rightly notes, that there are seals put to things for their
confirmation, and certain signs or badges answerable to seals given to
persons at their investiture, as a collar of S's, and a blew ribbon, with a
George, to the knights of the Garter, etc. We have both these seals, sigillum
rei by the Sacrament, and sigillum personae by the Spirit, which seals us to
the day of our redemption.

Thirdly, to prove any matter of fact in Courts of justice, witnesses are
produced: behold this proof of our right and title to a kingdom in heaven;
proof (I say) by witnesses beyond exception, the holy Spirit and our renewed
consciences: The Spirit it self bears witness with our Spirit, that we are
the children of God, Romans 8.16. On which words St. Chrysostom thus enlarges
himself, Chrysostom in epist. ad Romans c. 8. (...).
If a man, or an Angel, or an Archangel had promised thee this honor to be the
Son of God, thou might peradventure have made some doubt of it: but now
when God himself gives thee this title, commanding thee to call him Abba,
Father, who dare question thy title? If the King himself prick a Sheriff, or
send him the Garter, or the Seal, what subject dare gainesay it?

Lastly, as the Planets are known by their influence, and the Diamond by his
luster, and the Balsamum by his medicinal virtue, and the soul by her vital
operations: so the gift here promised is most sensibly known by the effects: 1
Exceeding love. 2 Secure peace. 3 Unspeakable joy. 4 Invincible courage.


He that is not certain that he has or ever shall receive any benefit by
another, or comfort in him, loves but a little. He that was condemned to die,
and cannot tell whether he has a pardon for his life or no, can be at no
peace: he that hears glad tidings, but gives little credit to them,
rejoices but faintly: he who has no assurance of a better life, will be
advised how he parts with this. But the Saints of God and Martyrs of Jesus
Christ are exceedingly enflamed with the love of their Redeemer, in comparison
whereof they esteem all things as dung: they enjoy peace that passes all
understanding, they are ravished with spiritual joy, they so little pass for
this present life, that they are ready not only to be bound but to dye for the
Lord Jesu; they rejoice in their sufferings, they sing in the midst of the
flames, they lie as contentedly upon the rack as upon a bed of down, they
prove masteries with all sorts of evil, they weary both tortures and
tormentors, and in all are more than Conquerours: therefore they know assuredly
how they stand in the Court of heaven; they feel within them what Christ has
done for them; they have received already the first fruits of heavenly joys,
and doubt not of the whole crop; they have received the earnest, and doubt not
of their full pay; they have received the seals, and doubt not of the deeds of
their salvation; they have received the testimony of the Spirit, and doubt not
of their adoption; they have received the white stone in my text, and doubt not
of their absolution from death, and election to a kingdom in heaven.

What do their dying speeches, that ought to live in perpetual memory, import
less?

First St. 2 Timothy 4.6, 7, 8.
Paul's: I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the
righteous Judge shall give me at that day.

Secondly of Hieron. l. de viris illustribus. Utinam fiuar bestus quae mihi
praeparatae sunt, quas and oro veloces mihi esse ad interitum, and alliciam ad
comedendum me, ne sicut and aliorum Martyrum non audeant corpus attingere. Quod
si venire noluerint, ego vim faciam ut devorar. Ignoscite mihi filioli, quid
mihi profit ego scio, nunc incipio esse Discipulus Christi: nihil de iis quae
videntur desiderans, ut Jesum Christum inveniam; ignis, crux, bestiae,
confractio ossium, membrorumque divisio, and totius corporis contritio, and
omnia tormenta Diaboli in me veniant, tantum ut Christo fruar; and cum ardore
pascendi rugientes audiret leones, ait frumentum Christi sum, dentibus
bestiarum molar, ut panis mundus inveniar.
Ignatius. When he heard the Lions roar for hunger, to whom he was suddenly to
be cast as a prey: O that I were with the beasts that are prepared for me, whom
I desire quickly to make an end of me: if they refuse to touch my body (as
through fear they have abstained from the bodies of other Saints) I will urge
and provoke them to fall upon me: Pardon me, children, I know what is good for
me, now I begin to be Christ's disciple, desiring none of those things which
are seen: that I may find Jesus Christ, welcome fire, cross, beasts, teeth,
breaking of my bones, tearing asunder of my members, grinding to powder of my
whole body; let all the torments which the Devil can devise come upon me, to
the end, or so that I may enjoy Jesus my love. I am Christ's corn, and
presently I shall be ground with the teeth of wild beasts, that I may be
served in as fine manchet at my Lords table.

Thirdly, of Babylas: Return to thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord has
rewarded thee: I shall now walk before the Lord in the land of the living.

Fourthly, of Constantine the great: Eusebius. de vit. Constant. l. 4. c. 6. (...).
Now I know my self to be truly happy, I have now attained the true light,
and none but my self understands, or can apprehend what happiness I am made
partaker of.

Fifthly, of Saint Bernardus moriens dixit, Duplici jure retinet Dominus meus
regnum coelorum, haereditate patris, and merito passionis; altero ipse
contentus, alterum mihi donavit. Author. vit. Bern. l. 1. c. 22.
Bernard: My Lord has a double right to the kingdom of heaven; by
inheritance, and by purchase; by inheritance of his Father, and purchase of his
own blood: with the former right himself is contented, the latter he has
given unto me: I am not worthy, I confess, neither can I by mine own merits
obtain the kingdom of heaven, but rest upon that interest which I have in the
merit of Christ's passion.

Sixthly, of Luther: Vit. Luther.
Receive my soul, Lord Jesu; though I be taken from this life, and this body
of mine be laid down, yet I know certainly that I shall remain with thee
for ever, neither shall any be able to pull me out of thy hand.

Seventhly, of Juel: Humfred. in vita Juelli.
A crown of righteousness is laid up for me; Christ is my righteousness,
this is my day, this day let me quickly come unto thee, this day let me see
thee Lord Jesu.

You have heard what we are to say in answer to the first question, An sit?
whether there be any such white stone? The second scientificall question is,
Quid sit? what this white stone is? And because the Logicians distinguish of, 1
Quid nominis. 2 Quid rei:
the quiddity, as they speak, of the name and of the thing: First, I will
declare the Quid nominis, what the word signifies, or to what the metaphor
alludeth; Nam de hoc calculo varii sunt Doctorum calculi. Although all who have
brought sweet lights to illustrate this dark prophecy, make it very clear
that the white stone is a Metaphor, and the gift a mystery; yet as Manna is
said to have rellished according to the several appetites of them that had
eaten it, so this white stone in the mystical signification appears diverse
to each Interpreters fancy: and though a white stone, even in the bottom of a
river, may easily be discerned; yet not when the water is troubled, as here it
is.

Some by it understand corpus glorificatum, a glorified body: and therein note
four properties, 1 Solidity. 2 Candor. 3 Rotundity. 4 Splendor.


The solidity in the white stone, say they, represents the impassibility: the
candor, the clarity and beauty: the roundnesse, the agility: the luster or
splendor, the subtility and glory of the Saints bodies raised from the dust.
Thus Aquin. in Caten.
Aquinas, who takes his hint from Rupertus, and he from Beda.

Others understand by the white stone, the grace of the spirit, which renews
our minds, making them pure and white, that is, innocent before God: so Junius
in Apoc. Gratiam spiritus quae imbuit novis moribus, and mentes puras and
candidas, id est, innocents reddit coram Deo.
Junius, Aretius, Chytreus, Piscator, and Mathesius.

Others interpret claritatem nominis, an illustrious name, or the honor and
title of a conqueror; either because, as Sextus Sen. bib. sanct. Calculo albo
praenotabantur, quo a caeteris discernerentur.
Sixtus Senensis notes, the days in which the Romans gained any signal
victory, were entered into their Fasti or registers with a white stone: or
because they who overcame, and had the better in the Olympicke games or races,
received for their guerdon a Aretas in Apoc (...).
white shining stone.

Veg. in Apoc. Deus per Christi opera, seu calculos computatorios, omnium
hominu^ rationem subducit.
Vegus goes a way by himself, taking this white stone for a white counter,
and yields this reason of his interpretation: Because God, says he, casts
all men's salvation by Christ's works and merits; and all that hope to clear
with him for the infinite debts of their sins, must reckon upon them, or else
they will fall short in their accounts. Behold Saul prophesies, Balaam
blesses, and a Jesuit delivers Protestant doctrine.

Coment. in Apoc.
Primasius and Victorinus will have this white stone to be alba ge^^a, a white
gemme, or glistering jewel or pearl, like that in the Gospel, which the rich
Merchant man sold all that he had to buy: but the word in the original is not
(...), or (...), but (...), a stone used in (...) in giving sentences, or
making decrees. The Judges among the Romans, when they acquitted any man, cast
in a white stone into an urne or pot, according to that of the Poet: Mos erat
antiquis niveis atrisque lapillis,
His damnare reos, illis absolvere culpa.


And likewise the Citizens of Rome in choosing their Magistrates, wrote his
name to whom they gave their voice, in a white stone. By allusion to which two
customs, I conceive the Spirit in this place promises to every one that shall
overcome the lusts of the flesh, by the Spirit; the assaults of the Devil, by
faith; and the persecutions and troubles of the world, by his constancy,
calculum absolutorium, and suffragatorium, an infallible token of his
absolution from death, and election to a crown of life; an assurance of
present justification, and future glorification.

Thus I take the Quid nominis to be clear: the greatest controversy is about
the Quid rei; what that gift or grace is; what that sign or token, what that
proof or testimony, whereby our present estate of grace, and future of glory
are secured unto us.

Some guess not far off the truth; That it is testimonium renovatae
conscientiae, the testimony of a renewed conscience. For as the eye in a glass
by reflection sees it self looking; so the conscience by a reflection upon it
self, knows that it knows God, and believes that it believes in Christ,
and feels that it has a new feeling, sense, and life. The eye of faith in
the regenerate sees himself sealed to the day of redemption, and observes
the print of the seal in himself, and the image of the heavenly which it
bears. I shall speak nothing to disparage this testimony of conscience,
which affords to every true believer singular contentment in life, and
comfort in death. The nearer the voice is, the briefer and more certainly we
hear it; and therefore we cannot but distinctly take that deposition for us,
which conscience speaks in the ear of the heart. And yet we have a nearer
and surer voice to settle our heart in the knowledge of our spiritual estate,
the testimony of Gods Spirit, which is nearer and more inward to our souls,
than our souls to our bodies: and the witness thereof may be as great, or a
greater joy to us, than if God had sent an Angel to us, as he did to Daniel,
to show unto us that we were beloved of him: or an Archangel, as he did to
the Virgin Luke 1.28.
Mary, to salute us, Hail thou that art highly favored of God. If any demand,
as she did, not out of any doubt, but out of a desire of farther information,
quomodo? that is, how does the Spirit testify to our spirits that we are the
sons of God? To speak nothing of elevations of Spirit, and raptures, and
special revelations, which are not now so frequent, and so certain as in
former ages; I answer, The Spirit testifies this unto us two manner of ways,
by Motions, or Words. Effects, or Deeds.


By words; so are the express words of Saint Prolog card. vert. 1. Dicuntur
tibi verba quaedam arcana intrinsecus, ut dubitare non possis quin juxta te fit.
Cyprian, As when lightning breaks the cloud, and the sudden splendor
thereof does not so much enlighten as dazzle the eyes: so sometimes thou art
touched with I know not what motion, and feel thy self to be touched, and
yet see not him that touches thee; there are inwardly spoken unto thee
certain secret words, so as thou can not doubt that he is near thee, even
within thee, who does solicit thee; yet does he not let thee see him as he
is. These secret words Saint Sermon. 1. in annunc Hoc est testimonium quod
perhibet Spiritus sanctus, dimissa sunt tibi peccata tua.
Bernard utters, This is the testimony or record which the Spirit bears
unto thee; Thy sins are forgiven thee. I take it the meaning of the words of
these Fathers is not that the holy Ghost does sound these formal words in our
bodily ears, but that as God once 1 Kin. 19.12
spoke in a still small voice, so in it still he speaks to the faithful, by
the Spirit, verbis mentalibus, by mental words or notions: by which he
continually inciteth us to good, restraines us from evil, forewarneth us of
danger, and comfort us in trouble. And whilst we listen to these notions,
or rather motions of the spirit within us, we hear this testimony often and
distinctly. But when we give ear to the motions of the evil Spirit, and
entertain him, and delight in his society, and thereby grieve and despite the
Spirit of grace; he being thus grieved by us, speaks no more words of
comfort in us, but withdrawes his gracious presence, and leaves us in horror
of conscience, and darkness of mind. In this time of spiritual desertion,
we think we have lost this white stone, though indeed we have not lost it,
but it is hid from us for a while: for afterward we shall find it, having
first felt the Spirit moving upon the waters of our penitent tears; and in our
pouring out our souls before God, assisting us with sighs and groans that
cannot be expressed: then after we renewing our covenant with him, our sins are
blown away like a thick mist: and light from heaven breaks in again upon
us, and with this light assurance, and with assurance peace, and with peace joy
in the holy Ghost.

Yea, but a weak Christian may yet demand, How may I be assured that my stone
is not a counterfeit? that my gold is not alchymy? that my pearl is not
glass? that my Edenis not a fools Paradise? that this testimony in my soul
is not a suggestion of Satan to tempt me to presumption, and thereby drown
me in perdition? The Spirit of God commanding me to 1 John 4.1. Believe not
every spirit, but try the spirit whether they are of God.
Try the Spirits whether they are of God or no, implies that there are Spirits
which are not of God: how then may I certainly know that this motion within me
is from the good, and not rather from the evil Spirit? By this, if it accord
with the word, and the testimony of thine own conscience: but if it vary from
either, thou have just cause to suspect it. If any Spirit shall tell thee that
thou art locked in the arms of Gods mercy, and can not fall from him, though
thou huggest some vice in thy bosom, and let loose the reins to some
evil concupiscence; give that Spirit the lie, because it accords not with
the word of God, testifying expressly, that Ephesians. 5.5.
no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which it an Idolater,
has any inheritance in the kingdom of God, and of Christ. For the grace of
God that brings salvation, has appeared unto all men, teaching us, that
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world. Again, if any Spirit tell thee that thou art
rich in spiritual graces, and lackest nothing, when thine own Spirit
testifies within thee, that thou art blind, and naked, and miserable, and
poor, believe not that Spirit. For the Spirit of God is a contest with our
spirit, Romans 8.16.
(...), He bears witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God:
and when they both sweetly accord, we may without presumption conclude with
Saint Tract. 22. in Joh Veritas pollicetur, qui credit habet vitam aeternam,
ego audivi verba Domini, credidit infidelis cum essem, factus sum fidelis;
sicut ipse monuit transii de morte ad vitam; in judicium non venio, non
praesumptione mea sed promissione ipsius.
Austine; The truth promises, whosoever believes in me has eternal life: I
have heard the words of the Lord, I have believed; whereas I was before an
Infidel, I am now made faithful, and according to his promise, have passed
from death to life, and shall come into no condemnation. It is no presumption
to ground assured confidence upon Christ's promise. Hereunto let us add the
testimony of the effects of saving grace. As the testimony of the Spirit
confirms the testimony of the Word, so the effects of saving grace confirm
both unto us. These Saint Bernard reckons to be, Hatred of sin. Contempt
of the world. Desire of heaven.


Hatred of our unregenerate estate past, contempt of present vanities, desire
of future felicity.

And doubtless if our hatred of sin be universal, our contempt of worldly
vanities constant, and our desire of heavenly joys fervent, we may build upon
them a strong persuasion, that we are in the favor of God, because we hate all
evil; that we are espoused to Christ, because we are divorced from the world;
and that heaven belongs unto us, because we long for it. Howbeit these seem
to be rather characters of christian perfection, than common works of an
effectual vocation. Though we arrive not to so high a degree of Angelical,
rather than humane perfection, yet through Gods mercy we may be assured of
our election by other more easy and common works of the Spirit in us, I
mean, true faith, sincere love of goodness in our selves and others, hungring
and thirsting after righteousness, striving against our fleshly corruptions,
godly sorrow, filial fear, comfortable patience, and continual growth in
grace and godliness. Tully writes of Cic. Verr. 5.
Syracuse, That there is no day through the whole year so stormy and
tempestuous, in which they have not some glympse of the sun: neither
undoubtedly after the travels of our new birth are past, is there any day so
overcast with the clouds of temptation, in the soul of a Christian, in which
the Sun of righteousness does not shine upon him, and some of these graces
appear in him. For if he decay in one grace, he may increase in another; if
he find not in himself sensible growing in any grace, he may feel in
himself an unfeigned desire of such growth, and godly sorrow for want of it;
and though he conquer not all sin, yet he allows not himself in any
sin; and though he may have lost the sense, yet not the essence of faith; and
though he be not assured in his own apprehension of remission of sins, yet
he may be sure of his adhesion to God, and relying upon him for the
forgiveness of them, with a resolution like that of Job, Though he kill me,
yet will I put my trust in him. And this is the sum and effect of what our
Christian casuists answer to the second question, Quid sit, what is the white
stone, whereby, as a certain pledge, grace and glory are secured unto us.

The third question yet remains, Propter quid sit, to what end this white stone
is given.

In the maine point of difference between the reformed and the Roman Church,
concerning assurance of salvation, that we be not misled, we must
distinguish of a double certainty: The one of the subject, or of The person.
The other of the object: or of The thing it self.
The certainty of the one never varieth, because it depends upon Gods
election: the certainty of the other often varieth, because it depends upon
the vivacity of our faith. Even as the apple in the eye of many creatures
waxes and waineth with the Moon; and as Solin. Poly-hist. c. 56. Uniones
quoties excipiunt matutini aeris semen, fit clarius margaritum; quoties
vespertini, fit obscurius.
Solinus writes, that the Margarite is clearer or duskier, according to the
temper of the air, and face of the sky, in which the shellfish opens it
self: so this latter assurance waxes and waineth with our faith, and is more
evident, or more obscure, as our conscience is more or less purged from dead
works. If our faith be lively, our assurance is strong; if our faith fail,
our assurance flagges, and in some fearful temptation is so far lost, that
we are brought to the very brinke of despair; partly to chasten us for our
former presumption, partly to abate our spiritual pride, and humble us before
God, and in our own spirits; but especially to improve the value of this
jewel of assurance, and stir us up to more diligence in using all possible
means to regaine it, and keep it more carefully after we have recovered it. By
the causes of Gods taking away of this white stone from us, or at the least
hiding it out of our sight for a while, we may guess at the reasons why he
imparteth it unto us.

1. First, to endeare his love unto us, and inflame ours to him. For how can
we but infinitely and eternally love him, who has assured us of infinite
joys, eternal salvation, an indefeizable inheritance, everlasting
habitations, and an incorruptible crown?

2. Secondly, to encourage us to finish our christian race, through many
afflictions and persecutions for the Gospels sake; which we could never do if
this crown of glory were not hung out from heaven, and manifestly exhibited to
the eye of our faith, with assurance to win it by our patience.

3. Thirdly, but especially, to kindle in us a most ardent desire, and
continual longing to arrive at our heavenly country, where we shall possess
that inheritance of a kingdom, which is as surely conveyed unto us by the
Word and Sacraments, as if Almighty God should presently cause a special deed
to be made, or patent to be drawn for it, and set his hand and seal to it
in our sight.

To knit up all that has been delivered, that it may take up less room in
your memory, and be more easily borne away; let me entreat you to set before
your eyes the custom of the Romans, in the entertainment of any great
personage, whom after they had feasted with rare dainties served in covered
dishes, at the end of the banquet they gave unto him an Apophoreton, or
Carry-away, as they called it; that is, some jewel or piece of coin with his
name engraven on it, or some special poesy. Such entertainment is promised in
my text, and performed on this holy Table: Christ who is both Host and feast,
bids you to his hidden Manna in the Sacrament, and tendereth to every one of
you a white stone, with your new name written in it, for your Apophoreton. What
remains, but that by particular examination, and fervent prayer, and special
faith, and intention of devotion, ye prepare your stomachs for these covered
dishes, and the hidden Manna; and after you have fed upon it, receive the white
stone of absolution, and keep it safe by you, and have it always in your
eyes? Let not your importunate clients so trespass upon your time, but that
you reserve always some golden moments in every day, and especially on the
Lords day, to be clients to God. So peruse other writings and Records, that
you forget not to search the deeds and evidences of your own salvation: before
you give learned counsel to others, to secure and clear their titles to
their lands on earth, ask you counsel of the spirit; and with David, Psalm.
119.24
make Gods statutes your counsailers, to secure your title to a kingdom in
heaven. Make your election, whereof the white stone in my text is a clear
evidence, sure unto your selves, by the marks which I have described unto you,
hatred of sin, and contempt of the world, and desire of heaven; secure it to
your souls by the life of your faith, and strength of your hope, and ardency
of your love, and extremity of your hunger and thirst for righteousness, and
your earnest strife and most vehement fight against all your corruptions, by
your deep sorrow for your sins, careful watching over all your ways,
sonnelike fear of displeasing your heavenly father, universal conformity to
his will, and humble submission to his rod, with continual growth in grace,
and mending your pace toward heaven, the nearer you come to your journyes end.
So shall you overcome the devil by your faith, the world by your hope, the
flesh by your spiritual love, sinful joys by your godly sorrow, carnal
security by your watchful care and filial fear, dreadful crosses by your
comfortable patience, and dangerous relapses by your proficiencie in
godliness, and all sorts of temptations by your constant perseverance: And
thus overcomming, Christ will make good his promise unto you, set before you
the hidden Manna, and give you this white stone, which none shall be able to
take away from you; and lay you all, as so many precious stones, in the Apoc.
21.19.
foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem, descending from God: To whom, etc.

THE NEW NAME. THE XXVIII. SERMON.
APOC. 2.17. And in the same stone a new name written, which no man knows
saving he that receives it.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
IN this close of a letter, endited by the Spirit, and endorsed to the Angel
of the Church of Pergamus, our Emperor Christ Jesus his donatives to his
victorious soldiers are set forth to the best advantage of art. To him, that
is, to every one whosoever he be, Jew or Gentile, bond or free, young or old,
Captain or common soldier, that overcommeth the flesh by subduing it, the
world by despising it, the devil by defying him, and quenching all his fiery
darts on the buckler of his faith dipped in Christ's blood; I will give out of my
bounty, not for the merit of their service, the hidden Manna of consolation,
the white stone of absolution, and the new name of adoption, which no man
knows saving he that receives it.

The hidden Manna I set before you, when I first entertained your religious
attention with the mystical delicacies this text affords. The last time I
delivered unto you the white stone: and now I am to spell and read unto you
your new name, and both declare what it is, and why engraven in this white
stone; as also, how so engraven that it can be read by none save him who
owneth it. For my method, I will take it from Masters of Music and dancing:
for as they first tune their instruments, then finger the streines of some
exquisite lessons on it, and finally teach their scholars how to foot the dance
accordingly: so the divine assistance concurring with your patience, I will
first, by endeavoring to accord the several interpretations of the words, as
it were, tune the strings: next, by delivering unto you the doctrines of this
scripture, set to the lessons: and last of all, by applying them to your lives
and conversations, direct you how you are to order your feet, according to the
heavenly music pricked by the Spirit in the rules of my text.

But because it is very hard to read letters or characters engraven in brass
or stone, if the brass or stone be covered with dirt, or blotted with ink;
before I proceed to spell your name, I hold it requisite to rub out those
spots, and wipe away those blots, which the ancient Pelagians, and late
Pontificians have cast upon this white stone; I mean, our Protestant doctrine
concerning the assurance of our salvation in particular.

William, or thou John, or thou Peter art assured of thy salvation?

2. They cast this blurre upon it, That it has no place in the Apostles Creed,
and therefore in scorn and derision they term it the thirteenth article.

3. They allege against it, That it has no footing at all in reason. For, say
they, we ought continually to pray for the remission of our sins, which we
need not to do if we were assured of our justification and salvation.

4. They article against it, That it crosses all such texts of Scripture,
wherein fear is commended unto us, as a special help and furtherance to
eternal salvation. To what end does David advise, Psalm. 2.11.
Serve the Lord with fear: and Saint Paul admonish, Rom 11.20.
Be not high minded, but fear: and, Phil. 2.12.
work out your salvation with fear and trembling: and Saint Peter exhort, 1
Pet. 1.17.
pass the time of your sojourning here in fear; if all true believers are so
assured of their salvation, that they are in no danger of forfeiting their
estate of grace here, or losing their crown of glory hereafter?

5. They allege against it, That it dulleth the edge of industry, and cools
the heat of zeal, and takes away all care of walking exactly before God, and
uprightly before men: care and watchfulness, in their judgment, are
superfluous where salvation and eternal happiness is secured.

The first blot is thus wiped out. Resp. ad 1.
As all parts are contained in the whole body, so all particulars and singulars
are vertually enclosed in generals and universals: and therefore as when we
read, That all men are sinners; and, all men are deprived of the glory of God;
and, in many things we offend all, every man lays his hand upon his heart,
and acknowledges himself to be of the number: and as when we read, We must
all appear before the tribunal seat of Christ, every good Christian applies
it unto himself, and makes full account one day to answer at that bar: so
when peace of conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost, and assurance of eternal
bliss are promised to all believers in Scripture, every faithful heart
rejoiceth at them, as having special interest in them. I would feign know of
our adversaries, when a Proclamation is published in the Kings name to all his
loyal subjects, whether every particular man within his realms and dominions
be not liable to the Kings high displeasure, in case he disobey this his
Majesty's edict, though no man be therein particularly named. Now what are the
Ministers of the Gospel, but Gods Cryers, to proclaim his good pleasure,
concerning the receiving all penitent sinners and believers into grace and
favor? Our adversaries themselves believe that this Pope Urban the eighth is
Christ's Vicar, and cannot err in Cathedra; and that this Priest, viz. Fisher,
or Musket, has power to remit sins, and in the administration of the
Sacrament, to turn the bread into Christ's body; yet let them turn over all
the Bible, they shall no where find the name of Priest Musket, Father Fisher,
or Pope Urban. Here if they fly to general promises, made to all the Apostles
and their successors, they stifle the winde-pipe of their own objection, and
confess consequently, so the general be in Scripture, we need not trouble
our selves with the particular. But the general I have proved at large out of
Scripture, that assurance of salvation is a privilege granted to all the
children of God, that hear the testimony of the Spirit, and see the infallible
marks of Gods chosen in themselves.

Resp. ad 2.
The second blot is thus rubbed out: This white stone, the assurance of a man's
particular salvation, is comprised in the first words of the Creed, which
according to the exposition of the Eusch. Emissen. in symb.
Ancie^^s, imports, I trust in God for salvation. For we say not, I believe
there is a God, which is credere Deum; nor I believe God, which is credere Deo;
but I believe in God, that is, I put my religious trust and confidence in him.
Beside, the true meaning of that article, I believe the forgiveness of sins,
is not only, I believe there is a remission of sins in the Church, which the
devil himself does, and yet is no whit the better for it; but I believe the
remission of my own sins, as I do the resurrection of my own flesh. And if
this be the true meaning of that Article, which Rome and Rhemes shall never
be able to disprove, the assurance of our own justification and salvation is
not, as they cavil, a thirteenth article of the Creed, but part of the tenth.
To which Saint In psalm. 32. Dicit anima fecura. Deus meus es tu, quia dicit
Deus animae ego sum tua s^lus.
Austine subscribed; The devout soul says confidently, thou art my God,
because God says to the soul, I am thy salvation.

Resp. ad 3.
The third blot is thus wiped out: Prayer for remission of sins, and assurance
thereof may well stand together. After the Prophet Nathan had said to David,
The Lord has taken away thy sin, David believed the remission thereof; yet
he prayed most fervently for it: Psalm. 51.7.14.
Purge me with Hyssope and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be whiter
than snow. Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities,
deliver me from blood guiltiness O God, thou God of my salvation. Our blessed
Redeemer was assured that God would deliver him from the power of death and
Psalm. 16.10.
hell; yet in the Heb. 5.7.
days of his flesh he offered up prayers with strong cries to him that was
able to save him. Saint Paul was assured by faith, that God would 2 Timothy 4.18.
deliver him from every evil work, and preserve him to his heavenly kingdom;
yet he ceased not to pray, Libera nos a malo; Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil. To cut all the sinews of this objection at once, we
distinguish of three sorts of Christians: 1 Incipients. 2 Proficients. 3
Perfect.
Incipients pray for the remission of their sins, and assurance thereof to
their conscience: Proficients for greater assurance, and farther growth in
grace: those that are perfect (so far as perfection may be attained in this
life) for the abolishing of all power of sin in them, and their public
acquitting at the last day: and all three for a pardon of course, at least for
such sins of infirmity, as stick so close unto us that we cannot shake them
off till we put off this earthly tabernacle. For albeit every true believer is
firmly persuaded of the love of God, and the free pardon of all his sins in
general; yet because no particular sin can be actually remitted before it be
committed, neither is the remission of any promised, but upon condition of
repentance, and confession to God of all known sins in special, and Psalm.
19.12. Who can understand his errors? O cleanse thou me from secret faults.
unknown in general: every one that is careful of his salvation, and
mindful of the command of Christ employed in the pattern of all prayer, will
sue out a pardon for every new sin, which through the frailty of his nature he
falls into, by humble confession and prayer to God. Which prayer, because it
cannot be acceptable to him without faith, he who prays for the remission of
his sins, in the very instant when he prays believes that God will hear
him, and that he either has, or will certainly pardon him. And so we see that
this third objection either has no edge at all, or if it has any, wounds
the adversaries cause, if it be thus retorted against him. Whatsoever we pray
to God for according to his will, we ought steadfastly to believe that we shall
receive it. But every true believer prays for the remission of his sins,
according to Gods will and command. Therefore every true believer ought
steadfastly to persuade himself that his sins are, or shall be certainly
forgiven him.


The fourth blot is thus wiped out. Fear is twofold: 1 That which is opposed
to carnal security. 2 That which is opposed to spiritual confidence.
The former is commanded in all the texts above alleged, and must stand with
assurance of salvation; the latter is forbidden by Esaias; Esaias 41.14.
Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel: I will help thee, says
the Lord, and thy Redeemer. c. 43. ver. 1.
Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art
mine. And by Luke 1.68, 69 74.
Zachary in his Hymn; Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which has visited
and redeemed his people. And has raised up an horn of salvation for us in the
house of his servant David. That we being delivered from the hands of our
enemies, might serve him without fear. And by St. Paul, Romans 8.15.
Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear. And by Luke 12.32.
Christ himself, Fear not little flock, for it is your Fathers pleasure to
give you the kingdom. This latter fear, because it excludes confidence in
God, is excluded it self: but the former not only stands with certainty of
perseverance in grace, but mightily supporteth it. For even for this end God
promises to put that fear in the hearts of all true believers, that Jer.
32.40.
they may not fall away from him. Whereupon Tertullian acutely infers,
playing upon the double sense of the Latin word securus; De cult Jer^n. Qui
secutus est non est solicitus, qui est solicitus potest esse secutus.
He that is secure (that is, careless) of the means of his salvation, is not
solicitous or watchful; but he that is solicitous or watchful may be
secure, that is, free from all fear of unavoidable danger.

The last objection which our adversaries make against the doctrine delivered,
is taken out of the worme-eaten evidence of the ancient Pelagians, as we may
see in Saint Ep. ad August. Dicunt lapsis curam resurgendi adunt, and sanctis
occasionem teporis offerri, eo quod electi nulla negligentia possint excidere.
Hage conference, p. 12. etc.
Prosper: They (viz. the Pelagians) upbraid, that all care of rising out of
sin is taken away from those that are lapsed; that to holy men is ministered
an occasion of slacknesse in their devotion, or lukewarmnesse, inasmuch as the
Elect (according to our doctrine) cannot fall away by any negligence, howsoever
they behave themselves; and that consequently this doctrine takes away all
prayers, obsecrations, obtestations, exercise of mortification, and care of the
means of renewing our covenant with God, and watchfulness over all our ways.
But we answer with the ancient Aug. de correp. and great. Prosp. resp. ad
ob^ect Vincent.
Fathers, that the certainty of the end no way derogateth from the necessity of
the means of salvation, which on Gods part are admonitions, threatenings,
promises, commands, counsels, punishments and rewards: on our part, continual
prayer, watchfulness, progress in godliness, and unfeigned desire of, and
earnest striving for perfection. After Christ prayed for S. Peter's faith, that
Luke 22.32. I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.
it might not fail, Peter was assured of his perseverance; yet Christ
commands him with the rest, Mar. 14.37.38. Christ says to Peter, Simon
sleep thou? could not thou watch with me one hour? watch and pray lest
ye enter into temptation.
to watch and pray lest they enter into temptation: watchfulness therefore and
assurance are not incompatible. None ever had greater assurance of their
salvation than the Apostles, after Christ cheared their hearts, Luke 10.20.
In this rejoice, not that spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice
because your names are written in heaven: yet our Savior admonishes them to
Luke 12.35.
stand with their loins girt about, and their lights burning; and to take heed
to themselves L^k. 21.34.
lest at any time their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness,
and cares of this life, and so that day come upon them at unawares.
Questionless after Christ had given to Saint Act. 27.24.
Paul the life of all them that were in the ship with him, he was assured of
their safe arrival; yet when the shipmen were about to fly out of the ship,
under color as though they would have cast anchor, Paul said to the Centurion,
and to the soldiers, except these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved.
None may otherwise receive or apply to themselves the promises of grace, and
remission of sins, than they are tendered to them in holy Scripture: but in
them they are propounded unto all upon condition of repentance, faith,
holiness of life, new obedience, and perseverance in it to the end. To believe
therefore the remission of sins, and to be assured of Gods favor,
notwithstanding we hold on our sinful courses, is not spiritual confidence,
but carnal presumption.

Assurance of salvation is an effect of a lively faith, which Gal. 5.6.
works by love; and consequently all that have it, the more they are assured
of Gods love to them in Christ, the more their hearts are enflamed with love
toward God, and their neighbor also for Gods sake; the more zealous they will
be of his glory, the more thankful for his mercy, the more desirous to
please him, the more fearful to offend him, the more careful to obey him, the
more wounded with godly sorrow for their incurring his displeasure, and the
more ready to turn unto him by unfeigned repentance. Admit what they so much
clamor against us for, that the adopted sons of God are in no fear or
distrust that their heavenly Father will disinherite them; yet neither may
they, nor can they presume hereupon wilfully to provoke him; because they know
that he has many sharp rods to chasten them with besides; as temporal
plagues, painful sickness, irrecoverable losses, terrors of conscience, and
spiritual desertion. To conclude, the certainty of our belief that we shall
undoubtedly arrive at the celestial Canaan, is no reason why we should flacke,
but rather mend our pace thither.

Thus having wiped out the spots and blots, which the ancient and latter
Pelagians have fast upon the white stone, we shall more easily be able to
discern the characters engraven in it, and read

The new name. We receive many new things from our Savior: 1 A Mat. 26.28.

new name, upon which the Interpreters have many new conceits.

Alcazar the Jesuit, whose profound head the Pope lately graced with a
Cardinals hat, in his prolixe commentaries upon the Apocalypse, falling upon the
words of my text, will needs have this new name to be some derivative from
Jesus, as Jesuitae or Jesuati, or the like. For this name Jesus (as out of
Galatians he endeavors to prove) according to the true characters and points
in the Hebrew, is novum nomen, a new name, never given to any but our Savior:
and of this name above all other names it is most certain that no man knows
the virtue thereof, but he that is partaker of it. In which interpretation the
Jesuits affection seems to me to have over-swayed his judgment. For as
Aristoxenus the Musician, out of an admiration of his own profession, defined
the soul to be an Cic. Tusc. 1.
harmony; so this expositour, out of a love to his own society, resolves this
new name can be no other than a denominative from Jesus. But he should have
considered that this new name here promised to the Angel of Pergamus, is 1500.
years elder than Ignatius their Patriarch; and is not promised to him only,
but to all Christian conquerours in alleges; whereas the name Jesuit, before
Layola in this age so christened his disloyal offspring, was never heard of
in the world. Neither lies there hid such a mystery in the name Jesuit, that
no man knows it saving he that receives it: it is known well enough, not
only to Romanists of other orders, but also to those of the reformed Church,
who yet never received the badge of their profession, nor any mark of the
Apoc. 14 9.
beast.

Victorinus and some others with more probability guess the new name to be
here meant Christianus, of which they understand those words of Esa. 62.2.
Esaias, they shall be called by my new name.

Aretas gives the same interpretation of the white stone, and the new name, by
both which the conqueror in proving masteries was made known to the people.

Carthusian distinguishing of the essential and accidental rewards in heaven,
and calling the former auream, the latter aureolam, conceives this white stone
to be aureolam, a gemme added to the Saints crown of glory; and in it the
name of Beatus engraven, which no man can know but he that receives it;
because 1 Cor. 2.9.
eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man,
the things which God has prepared for them that love him.

Illyr. in Apoc Scribam cum haeredem vitae aeternae.
Illyricus and Osiander relating the custom of the Romans in the election of
their chief Magistrates, to write his name to whom they gave their voice in a
white stone, thus comment upon the words of my text: Him that overcommeth I
will entertain with hidden Manna, and I will declare him heir apparent to a
crown in heaven, I will elect him to a kingdom.

Comment. in 2. Apoc.
Pareus expounds novum nomen, nomen dignitate praestans, a name of honor and
renown.

Junius annot in Apoc. Induendo novum hominem, quem nemo novit nisi spiritus
hominis, qui in ipso est, cujus laus non est ex hominibus, sed ex Deo.
Junius glosseth it, signum and indicium novitatis vitae, a sign and token of
newness of life.

Lastly, Victor Pictabionensis, Sardus, Beda, Bulenger, Melo, Primasius,
Rupertus, Pererius, and other expositours, generally concur upon Filius Dei;
the new name; say they, written in the white stone, is the sun of God. Which
their opinion they illustrate by other texts of Scripture; as namely, Romans
8.15.16. and, 1 John 3.1. and they back it with this reason; The new name here
is such a one as no man knows saving he that receives it, and what can that
name be but the title of the sons of God, which no man knows, saving he
that receives the Spirit of adoption, whereby he cries Romans 8.16.
Abba Father; which Spirit testifies to his spirit that he is the child of
God? All other expositions may after a sort be reduced to this, for this is a
blessed name, according to Carthusians interpretation: for the children of God
are the children of the resurrection, and they are most happy. It is the name
of Christian conquerors, according to Victorinus and Aretas his gloss; for 1 John 5.4.
every one that is borne of God overcommeth the world; and, this is the victory
that overcommeth the world, even our faith. This is also a symbol and token of
newness of life; for all the regenerate sons of God Ephesians. 4.24.
have put on the new man. This name indeed is a glorious name in Pareus his
sense; for if it were an honor to David to be sonne-in-law to an earthly
King, how much more honorable is it to be the adopted son of the King of
heaven? Lastly, this name imports, according to Illyricus and Osianders joint
explication, haeredem vitae aeternae, heir of eternal life; for if Romans 8.17.
sons, then heirs.

And thus, as you hear, the strings are tuned, and all interpretations
accorded: now I set to the lessons, or doctrinall points, which are four; 1
The title of sons, novum nomen. 2 The assurance of this title, inscriptum
calculo. 3 The knowledge of this assurance, novit qui recipit. 4 The propriety
of this knowledge, nemo novit nisi qui recipit


The Roman Generals after their conquests of great countries and cities, had
new names given unto them; as to Publius Scipio was given the surname of
Africanus, to Lucius Scipio of Asiaticus, to Metellus of Numidicus, to Pompey
of Hierosolymarius: in like manner our celestial Emperor promises to all
that overcome their spiritual enemies, a new name, and eminent title of
honor; even that which Alexander the conqueror of the whole world most
triumphed in, when the Egyptian Priest saluted him, (...), Son of God. But
why is this called a new name? Either because it is unknown to the world, and
worldly men; or in opposition to our old name, which was, sons of Adam. That
is the name of our nature, this of grace; that of our shame and misery, this of
our glory and happiness; that is a name from the earth, earthly, this is a
name from the Lord of heaven, heavenly. And it appertains to all the Saints
of God in a threefold respect: 1 Of Regeneration. 2 Adoption. 3 Imitation.
Regeneration makes them sons of God: Adoption heirs with Christ: Imitation
like both.


When the Astronomer that calculated the nativity of Reginaldus Polus was
derided of all, because the disposition of the man was known to all to be
contrary to those characters which he gave of him, Poole facetely excused the
matter, saying, Such an one I was by my first nativity as he has described
me, but since that I was born again. This (...), or second birth, though
Nicodemus at the first deemed a riddle, because it could not enter into his
head, how a man could re-enter his Mothers womb, and be borne the second time;
yet after our Savior ingeminated this doctrine unto him, Joh. 3.5.
Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, he gave credit unto it, as
all must do who look for the inheritance 1 Pet. 1.4.
incorruptible and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for
them: 1 Pet. 1.3.
for all those are begotten again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, not with corruptible seed, but with incorruptible: and after they are
begotten they are born again of water and the Spirit, and 1 Pet. 2.2.
as new born babes they desire the sincere milk of the word, that they may grow
thereby; and as they grow 2 Cor. 4.16.
the old man decays in them, and the inward man is renewed daily. Inregard of
which great alteration and change wrought in them by the Spirit of regeneration
was it, that the holy Father, when he was solicited by the Mistress of his
affections in former times, claiming ancient familiarity with him, put her off,
saying, Ego nunc non sum ego; I am not the man thou take me for: thou art
indeed thou, remaining still in thy unregenerate estate, but I am not I. And
unless we all feel and observe in us Romans 12.2.
a transformation by the renewing of our mind, that we may prove what is that
good, that acceptable and perfect will of God, we cannot challenge to our
selves this new name, whereunto the Saints of God have yet a second right, by
the Romans 8.15.
Spirit of adoption.

Adoption, as Sum 1. p. ^. 93. Art. 4. Adop^o filiorum D^i est per
conformita^em ad ^maginem fil^^ nature lis, ^nperf^^te pude^ p^^ g^^tiam,
perf^c^e per glor^^m.
Aquinas defines it, is, by conformity to the image of the natural son of
God; imperfectly by grace here, and perfectly by glory hereafter. But this
great Schoole-man, it seems, was no great Lawyer, nor dived deep into the
nature of Adoption; which he here counfoundeth partly with sanctification,
which is our conformity in part to Christ by grace; and partly with
glorification, which is our perfect conformity to him, when our sanctification
is consummate in heaven. In precise truth, adoption is not by our conformity to
the image of Christ, but our conformity to the image of Christ is by the spirit
of adoption. Adoption, says Sen. controv. Ad p^^ est ^^si^t^ quae benefi^^
naturae and juris imitatur.
Seneca, is a most sacred thing, containing in it an imitation of nature,
civilly giving them sons, whom nature has left childlesse; and it may be
briefly defined, a legal supply of a natural defect, whereby they who can
beget no children, yet make heirs, to propagate their names to posterity, ut
sic abolita seculis nomina per successores novos fulgeant. According to which
definition, God cannot be properly said to adopt any children, though he give
them the titles of sons, and make them coheirs with Christ: for adoptio est
fortunae remedium, is provided as a remedy and comfort of those who are
destitute of children, and want heirs; God wants none, neither does he
adopt for his contentment, but for our solace and comfort. In civil adoption
the son begotten is not adopted, the adopted is not begotten: Nulla viro
soboles imitatur adoptio prolem. But in the divine adoption it is otherwise.
For God adopteth no son by grace whom he regenerateth not by his Spirit.
Moreover, in civil adoption the ground is either consanguinity or affinity,
which moved Julius to adopt Octavius: or if neither, eminency of virtue and
similitude of disposition, which induced Nerva to adopt Trajan. But in the
divine Pli^ pan^gyr. Nulla adoptati cum adoptato cognatio, null^ ^^cessitudo,
nisi quod uterque optim^s ^rat, dign^s^; alter ^ligi, alter eligere.
adoption on the contrary, God adopteth not us because of any kindred or
alliance in us to him antecedently; but he sent his son to take our nature
upon him, and become kin to us, that for his sake he might have some
occasion to adopt us. Men adopt those in whom they see worth, but God first
loves and gives worth, that he may more worthily adopt: and they whom he so
adopteth by the grace which he conferreth upon them, procure to themselves a
third right to this title of sons by imitation of their father.

This imitation consists in walking after the Spirit, as he is a Spirit: in
following after holiness, as he is most holy: in loving mercy, as his mercy is
over all his works: in purifying our hearts and hands, as he is purity it
self: in doing good to those that deserve ill of us, as he causes his Mat.

sun to rise upon the good and the bad, and his rain to fall upon the just
and the unjust: lastly, to aspire to perfection, as he is perfection it self.
In the holy language of Scripture rather expression of virtue than impression
of feature makes a son: all that through faith prevail with God are
accounted of the seed of Israel, and all believers the sons of Abraham: and
because the unbeleeving Jews did not the works of Abraham, Christ denies
them to be his children. John 8.39
If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.
Whereupon Sermon. 125. in Evang. Qui genitotis ope^^^n facit, a^^a^ genus.
Chrysologus infers, He that does not the works of his Progenitors, in

saw in his tender years an assay, and as it were the first draught of his
own virtues. On the contrary, the Roman Censors took such a distaste at the
son of Africanus for his debauched life, that they took a ring off his
finger, in which the image of his father was engraven, because he so much
degenerated from his fathers excellent virtues; they would not suffer him to
wear his fathers picture in a ring, whose image he bare not in his mind:
neither will God suffer any to bear his name, and be accounted his sons, who
bear not his image, who resemble not his attributes in their virtues, his
simplicity in their sincerity, his immutability in their constancy, his purity
in their chastity, his goodness in their charity, his holiness in their
piety, his justice in their integrity. Regeneration is wrought in the heart
known to God only; adoption is an act sped in the court of heaven, which none
knows on earth but he that receives an exemplification of it by the Spirit:
but imitation of our heavenly Father, by a heavenly conversation, proclaims
us to all the world to be his sons. The title thus cleared, the next point is
the perpetuity thereof, represented unto us by the engraving the new name in
the white stone: I will give him a white stone, and in it a new name written or
engraven. When the Pharisees appeached the woman taken (...), in the foul act
of adultery, it is there said, that our Savior stooping down wrote on the
ground: but what he wrote the Evangelist writes not. Saint In Evang. Terram
terra accusat.
Ambrose ghesseth that he wrote Earth accuses earth: St. Austine these words,
He that among you is free from sin, let him cast the first stone. Others are
of opinion that he wrote in the dust some private sins of the accusers; whose
opinion has thus far footing in Scripture, that God, whose mercy is over all
his works, writes the sins of men in dust, but his gifts and favors with a
Diamond in precious gemmes; as we may see on Exodus 28.20.
Aarons breastplate, and here in a solid white stone.

White stones, such as this in my text, were in great use among the Romans, and
served 1 To declare the victour or conqueror in proving masteries. 2 To acquit
the accused in courts of justice. 3 To deliver suffrages in the election of
Magistrates.
Upon all these uses the allegory in my text touches. For this white stone is
given in token of victory, Vincenti dabo: and before I demonstrated it to be
an evidence of our justification; and now I shall show it to be an assurance
of our election to a kingdom in heaven. As in the civil, so much more in the
divine use, the act signified or done by it is altogether irrevocable. He to
whom the white stone was given in the theater, or wheresoever the silver games
were kept, or prizes played, was ever held Victor, and carried that title to his
grave. He upon whom the Judges passed their sentence by casting white stones
into an urne or pitcher, was for ever acquitted of the crime laid to his
charge. He who gave his voice to any man, by writing his name in a white
stone, neither did nor could after vary: and shall we think that he to whom
Christ gives his white stone shall ever lose the benefit thereof? The names of
the twelve tribes engraven upon the twelve precious stones on Aarons
breast plate, continued for many hundreds of years, as you may read in
Josephus, and may be in them still for ought we know; yet if they could be
razed out, certainly their names cannot be blotted out Luke 10 20.
which are written in heaven. The calling and gifts of God are without Romans

by no means. For though a servant may cease to be a servant if his Master
cashiere him; and a tenant to be a tenant if he have forfeited his estate,
yet a son cannot cease to be a son; he that is borne, cannot but be
borne; and if he be borne of God he cannot (...), though he may (...), he
cannot do though he may suffer sin, that is, he cannot practice it, as a man
does his trade or profession, in a settled course, without check of
conscience, or reluctance, because the seed of God remains in him, which
fights against the poison instilled by Satan, and will in the end conquer it,
because it is 1 Pet. 1.23.

You will say peradventure, this assertion opens a window to presumption, and
carnal liberty: nay rather it shuts the leaves against it, and fasteneth
them with surest bolts and bars. For lay this for a ground, that he that has
received the Spirit of regeneration, and grace of adoption, cannot sin
desperately, nor give absolute way to any corruption: the conclusion to be
built upon it will be this (which necessarily checketh and choaketh all
presumptuous thoughts) That whosoever defiles his mouth with oaths or lies,
his hand with bribes, his body with uncleanness, his conscience with any
known sin, finding in himself no check with it, no struggling against it,
no smiting of the heart after it, no earnest desire, and in the end effectual
working out of it; was never a true convert, the sun of righteousness never
rose on him, because he yet lies frozen in the dregs of his natural
corruption. Cant. 2 5.
Stay me with flaggons, and comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love; the
doctrine of the perpetuity of the regenerates estate is a cup of the strongest
wine in those flaggons, which must be given to none but such as amore
languent, such as have been contracted to Christ, and have received from him
many jewels of grace, and infallible tokens of special affection, though at
the present by some fearful provocation, they have so far incurred his
displeasure, that he will not look upon their tears, nor hearken to their
sighs or groans, nor once turn his countenance toward them, which they
infinitely value above their life. To these we are to minister this cordial;
That Christ his contract with the soul is indissoluble, that the Covenant of
his peace is immovable, that the seed of regeneration is immortal, that whom
God loves he loves to the end, that they may have lost the sense, but they
cannot the essence of true faith, that their new name is still written upon the
white stone, though such a mist be cast before their eyes that they cannot
read it now; but after a great defluxe of penitent tears, Christ will anoint
them with the eye salve of his Spirit, and then they shall clearly see and
read it: for he that receives it knows it. And so I fall into the third
point, the knowledge of this perpetuity:

He knows it who receives it. As the eye sees either

1. Per radium rectum, a straight line drawn from the eye to the object: Or,

2. Per radium reflexum, a beam reflected from the object to the eye: so the
soul has a double knowledge; direct, of the object; and reflexe, of her own
acts. As when I look in a glass I look upon my self looking in it: when I
touch my pulse I feel my feeling of it: in like manner the soul by reflexive
knowledge apprehends her own apprehension, judges of her own judgment,
and believes her own faith and belief. How can there be any assurance by
faith, if there be no assurance of faith it self? Saint Ep. 112 c 3. Fides
ipsa mente u^que videtur quamvis hoc fide credatur quod non videtur.
Austine is most express for this reflexive act of faith: Faith it self,
says he, is seen in the mind, though we believe those things by faith
which we cannot see: and again, De trin. l. 13. c. 2. Fides est in intimis
nostris mentibus, nec eam quisquam hominum videt in alio, sed in semet-ipso.
Faith is in the inward parts of the soul, neither can any man see it in
another, but in himself he may. Could there be any doubt of this, I would
evict it out of the express words of our Savior ( Joh. 14.20.) In that day
you shall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you. And of
Saint Paul: 2 Cor. 13.5.
Examine your selves whether you be in the faith or no. Know ye not your
selves that Christ is in you, except you be reprobates? And, 2 Timothy 1.12.
I know whom I have believed. And, 1 Cor. 2.12.
We have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit of God, that we
might know the things that are freely given us of God. Hang up a taper or a
carbuncle in a dark room, and you shall perceive that first it discovers it
self by its own light, and then all things in the room. This taper or
carbuncle is faith in the soul, which as it manifests all other graces, so
most clearly also it self. The heat by the incident beam of the sun is but
weak, the greatest is by the reflected: so is it in the act of faith, there is
but small warmth of comfort from the direct act, whereby we believe the
singular privileges of all true believers; the greatest comfort is by the
reflexive, viz. that we are true believers, and share in those comforts.
Without this reflexive knowledge there can be Romans 14.5.
no (...), full persuasion in our minds, much less Ephesians. 3.12. In whom we
have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
access with confidence. Which yet the ancient Fathers not only teach
plainly out of the Apostle, but also show manifestly how it may be obtained. S.
Moral. q. 12. (...), etc.
Basil puts this case of conscience: How may the soul assuredly be
persuaded that God has forgiven unto her her sins? And he resolves it
thus: When she finds in her self the like disposition and affection to his,
that said, I hate iniquity, and all false ways I utterly abhor. Saint Amb.
Sermon. 2. de sermon.
Ambrose thus: He that cleaves to that leaven is made himself leaven, and
thereby sure of his own salvation, and secure of gaining others to the faith.
Saint Leo Sermon. 2. de pasch.
Leo thus: If they find any of the fruits of charity in their conscience, let
them not doubt but that God is in them. But we need not borrow torch light
where the sun shines so bright in holy scriptures. 1 John 5.10.
He that believes in the son of God has the testimony in himself: And,
the Romans 8.16.
Spirit testifies to our spirit, that we are the sons of God; the Spirit of
God warranteth the major, In whomsoever the marks of Gods children, set down
in scripture, are conspicuous, they are the sons of God: our Spirit
testifies the minor, that these marks are in us. Now because this assumption
can be proved no otherwise than by experience, and our own inward sense, my
fourth observation hence directly ensues, That no man knows the new name
save he that receives it: which is the last point now to be touched, and note
to be quavered on in my close, viz. the propriety of this knowledge.

None knows save he that receives it. For no man knows the things of a
man, save the 1 Cor. 2.11.
spirit of man that is in him. If this white stone were visible to the eye of
the body, and it were given to us in presence of others, it could not be but
that some should see and know it besides him that receives it. But this white
stone is conspicuous only to the eye of faith, which is the Heb. 11.1.
evidence of things not seen, and it is given by the Spirit which is
invisible, and received also by the inward faculties of our soul, which are
likewise invisible. Were this knowledge only conjecturall, and gathered from
outward signs and tokens, others might have notice thereof as well as our
selves: but the Spirit says here, No man knows save he that receives it. It
must be therefore a special act of special faith whereby we are assured of
our adoption by faith, and of faith by the Spirit. In Apoc. Sint duo quorum
uterque laudat mel, sed alterus lingua loquitur quod fauces ignorant, alterius
quod delectatio gustus cum docuerit.
Ansbertus gives good aim to the meaning of this text: Suppose two (says he)
commending honey, of whom the first discourses out of his reading, the tongue
of the second has tasted that he speaks of, such (says he) is the knowledge
of him who has received the white stone. Others may know it in specie, but he
in individuo: others contemplatively, but he experimentally. in Apoc. Tantae
excellentiae est nomen istud, ut nemo sciat quid valeat, quantum boni
comprehendat, nisi qui adoptatus est.
Sardus comes nearer the mark, This name (says he) is of such excellency,
that no man knows it, that is, the value and worth of it, but he who is
adopted by God. Rupert. in Apoc. Cui nemo scit nisi qui accipit? quia nominis
ejus scientiam non alterius extrinsecus documentum, sed proprium interius
efficit experimentum, ideo nemo scit nisi quem spiritus regenerando filium Dei
effecerit, and ipsa regeneratione scientem ejus rei doctumque suo tactu
effecerit.
Rupertus hitteth it; Why (says he) does no man know this name saving he that
receives it? Because this name cannot be known by any outward document, but
by an inward experiment; not by external evidence, but by inward sense:
therefore no man knows it saving he whom the Spirit by regeneration makes
the son of God, and by the same act makes him know it. There is a great
difference between a contemplative and an experimental knowledge of the
privileges of Gods children. A blind man from his birth may hear the theory
of the Sun read unto him, but he can never conceive rightly of the beauty of
that glorious lamp of heaven, or take the hundredth part of that delight which
we do who see it. The discourse of the Jewish Rabbis concerning the delicacy
of this Manna in my text is sweet, but nothing to the taste of it. The
meditations of Divines upon the joys of heaven are able to ravish the soul
with delight, yet are they nothing to St. 2. Cor. 12.2.
Paul's rapture into the third heaven: so far experimental knowledge in
particular exceeds contemplative in general. Out of this experimental
knowledge the Spouse testifies, Cant. 5 1.
I have eaten my honey comb, with my honey. To this the Prophet David inviteth,
Psalm. 34.8.
O taste and see how gracious the Lord is. For this the Apostle prays, that
the Philippians might abound in all spiritual wisdom and Psalm. 1.9. (...).
experience, or sense: and this is the knowledge here meant.

You have heard the lessons set in the lines of my text; what remains but
that according to my proposed method I direct you to foot the spiritual dance
accordingly?

1 And in the stone a new name. Mutatio nominis mutatio hominis, Applicat.
a new name should carry with it a new man. When God changed Genesis 32.28.
Jacobs name into Israel he changed his condition: and certainly Christ gives
this new name to none, to whom he gives not withal a new nature. If therefore
we expect that Christ should write this new name in a white stone, and give it
us; let us give all diligence that the image of the new man may shine in our
souls; otherwise, if the old Adam be young in us, if our old infirmities be
strong in us, if the old leven puffing us up with pride, and sowring the whole
lump of our nature is still in us; if our old corruptions, be they vicious, or
ambitious, or a varitious, or superstitious, still master us, this white stone
here mentioned will prove a black stone to us, and this new name written in it
a handwriting against us. For a Salvianus de provid. l. 4. Reatus impii pium
nomen. and l. 3. Quid est in quo nobis de Christiano nomine blandiamur, cum
utique hoc ipso magis per nomen sacratissimum rei simus quod a sanctimonia
discrepamus?
holy and godly title in a wicked man improveth the guilt of his sin.

This new name is the title of the Son of God, which appellation should bind us
to our good behavior, that we carry our selves so in private toward God, so
in public toward men, so holily in our devotion, so faithfully in our
vocation, so uprightly in our conversation, that we may be Proles tanto non
inficianda parenti, children not unworthy to be owned by such a Father, who
has adopted us in Christ. What a shame is it for a Prince, or the son of a
Noble man to filch and cheat, and take base courses, and live sordidly?
Tertullian strongly refuteth Montanus his prophecies by his personal
infirmities; What? (says he) a Prophet, and a Dicer? a Prophet, and an Usurer?
a Prophet, and fleshly given? a Prophet, and distemper himself with drink?
We may streigne this string higher, What? a Christian believer, and a Pagan
liver? the Son of God, and do the works of the Devil? the child of light,
and walk in darkness, in gluttony, chambering and wantonness, strife and
envying? an heir of heaven, and all his mind and thoughts upon the mucke and
dung of the earth? Why do thou reproach thine own Basil seleuc. Cur
appellationi cujus virtute cares contumelium irrogas? quid gestas cognomen?
quid personae probro sit? quid factis appelationem impugnas, and calumnia nomen
tuum afficis?
name? Why do thou disgrace thy greatest honor? Why do thou overthrow
thine own title by thy deeds?

3 If Christ has written our new name in a white stone, let us imprint his
name in our hearts, as Ignatius did, and that so deeply, if we may believe the
Legend, that the characters thereof were legible in it after his death: let us
sing a new song to him that has given us this new name.

4 If no man upon earth know to whom Christ has given this white stone saving
he that receives it, let us take heed how we suddenly write any man's name in a
black stone, I mean pass the censure of Reprobates upon them. The Mat. 7.1.
Judge himself advises not to judge, lest we be judged. The foundation of God
remains sure, having this seal, God knows who are his, not we: we ought to
labor for the reformation, and pray for the conversion, and hope for the
salvation of any to whom God, for ought we know, may give repentance unto life,
as he has given to us: They cannot be worse than we have been. Cypr. ep. l.
3. Nemo id sibi arroget quod sibi soli reservat pater.
Let no man arrogantly assume that to himself which the Father has reserved
to himself alone, viz. the fan to sever the wheat from the chafe in
Christ's floor.

5 Lastly, if we desire to eat of the hidden Manna, let us loathe the fleshpots
of Egypt; if we covet this white stone, let us value it above all precious
stones; if we expect this new name, let us contemn the titles of the world:
let us study less other men's titles and states on earth, and more our own
state in Gods promises, and title to heaven: let us view in the glass of holy
Scripture the true marks of Gods children, and seek to find them all in our
selves. So shall we be sure before death closes up our eyes, to have a sight
of this new name here, and after we remove hence to read it written in glorious
characters in the gates and walls of the new Jerusalem, descending from God,
whose Apoc. 21.19.
streets are paved with gold, and the gates and foundations of the walls
garnished with pearls and all sorts of precious stones: into which heavenly
Mansions, when we are ready for them, God receive us for his sake, who is gone
thither before to prepare them for us. To whom, etc.

SATANAE STRATAGEMATA. THE XXIX. SERMON.
2 COR. 2.11. Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant
of his devices.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
SCaliger has long since set forth an excellent work de emendatione temporum,
but we need rather books de emendatione morum. For in this Chrisis of
distempered humors, such is the condition of most hearers, that the Minister
of God, though upon good warrant from his text, can hardly rebuke the public
enemies of Church or State, but he shall procure private enemies to himself.
Every one is jealous that something is said or meant by our Paul's against his
great Diana. If he stand for, or be inclinable unto the new, or newly taken up
expressions of devotion, he suspects the Preacher glanceth at him under the
name of a temporizer, or symbolizer with Papists. If he be averse from such
customs and rites, he conceives himself to be taxed under the name of a
refractary Non-conformitant. If he make any great show of religion, he
thinks himself pointed at in the reproof of an Hypocrite; if little or no
show, he feels himself galled in the reprehension of the profane worldling.
If he relish the leaven of Arminius, he takes himself to be wounded through
the Pelagians; if of Cartwright, through the Brownists; if of Cassander, or the
Catholic Moderatour, through the lukewarm Laodicean sides. Yet I have met
with an enemy, through whose sides I am sure no man will hold himself wounded,
whose part no man will take, whose quarrels no man will own, against whom it
is lawful to cast not only fiery, but also poisoned darts, Tincta Lycambaeo
spicula fell -- whom to particularize is discretion; to stigmatize,
moderation; to curse to the deep pit of hell, piety; to hate with a perfect
hatred, the top of Christian charity: I mean the grand enemy of mankind, whose
name and spiritual snares you hear of in the reading of my text; but through
Gods help shall see, and handle them, and pull them asunder in the explication
and application thereof.

Plut. in Apoph. Optimus ille est Imperator qui maxim cognitas habet res
hostium. Et Eras. ap. l. 5.
Chabryas was wont to say, that he was the best Commander in war who best
understood his enemies. For knowing wherein their strength consisted, he could
prepare against it; and being acquainted with the manner of their fight, he
could discipline his soldiers accordingly; and having good intelligence what
courses they meant to take, he could prevent them therein, and always work
upon the advantage. As in all other sciences and arts, so in the military
profession there are certain axioms, maxims, or general rules: whereof the
first is, Vegetius de re milit. l. 3. c. 26. Quicquid tibi prodest adversario
nocet, quicquid illum juva, tibi semper officit.
Whatsoever is good for our enemies is always hurtful to us; for his gain is
our loss, his rise is our fall, his honor is our infamy, his help is our
hinderance, his devices are our snares, his plots are our traps, his inventions
are our circumventions. Wherefore it cannot but be a matter of great importance
to all that fight under the banner of Christ's cross against Satan and all his
infernal forces, to be informed out of Scripture, and the observations of the
best experienced soldiers in our spiritual warfare, wherein our ghostly
enemies strength lies, after what manner he assaulteth us, and what are his
usual stratagems whereby he most prevails; ut praemoniti, simus praemuniti,
that being forewarned of them, we way be forearmed against them. To which
end, among others, I pitched my serious thoughts upon this passage of
Scripture; wherein one of Christ's Worthies, who in his time fought many noble
battles, and was more than conqueror in them all, advertiseth the
Corinthians of a design that Satan had upon them, viz. by the rigor of their
severity to cast away one of the members of their Church, whom they had cast
out of their congregation for his incestuous match. Occas.
There was great reason the Elders and Governors at Corinth should be
exasperated against this delinquent, Call com. in 2 ad Cor.
qui primus nitorem ecclesiae tam turpi nota maculasset, who was the first that
blemished that Virgin Spouse of Christ: and therefore having received warrant
from the Apostle to proceed against him, they draw out their sharp sword of
excommunication, and presently cut him off from their assemblies; never
thinking they could do enough to manifest to the world their detestation of so
foul a fact, and fouler a scandale. Hereupon the common adversary works,
hardening their hearts more and more by a colorable pretense of zeal, and
locking up their ears against the prayers, and shutting their eyes at the
tears and lowest submission of this disconsolate penitent; that so he being
out of all hope of restitution to his former state, might run some desperate
course. And very like it was that Satan would have gone beyond them all, had
not the Apostle descried this his subtle device, and discovered it unto them in
this clause of his letter, which carries this sense:

Paraphr.
My beloved brethren at Corinth, it grieveth me to write any thing to you to
grieve you, who are the crown of my joy; and therefore I wrote heretofore more
smartly against him who troubled you, that I might make a trial of your love
toward me, in vindicating the honor of your Church, my plantation; and you
have abundantly testified your obedience to me, and zeal for the Gospel, by
putting him from among you, who brought an obloquy upon you, and blasted the
fruits of my labors. But now the case is much altered, he is not what he
was, he swells not with pride, but is fallen away with grief, and will
undoubtedly sink in despair, if you reach not out your hand of compassion to
save him from drowning in a sea of salt tears. Wherefore things standing thus
with him, let my pen which gave the wound, heal it; and if upon my former
letter, to show your obedience to me, you bound him with an anathema to
confirm the same, upon this letter release him: Una eademque manus vulnus
opemque ferat. If I forgave others for your sake, forgive him now for my sake,
or at least for your own sake, lest the common adversary make an advantage of
your zeal for the Church, to maime it; and abuse that power which God has
given you for edification, to the destruction of one, who before was, and after
reparation may be a living Temple of the holy Ghost.

The words contain in them a wise prevention of a subtle circumvention;
wherein I observe 1 A caution, Divis.
2 A reason.


The caution most seasonable, lest Satan should get an advantage.

The reason most forcible, for we are not ignorant of his devices.

In the former we are to take special notice, 1 Of the caveat put in, ne
circumveniat. 2 Of the party against whom it is put in, Satanas. 3 Of the
parties in whose behalf it is put in, nos.
1 Him. 2 You. 3 Me.


The reason is drawn from two heads, 1 The cause of the danger, (...), They
are devices. 2 The notice thereof, (...), We are not ignorant of them.


First, of the caution: (...). Some render these words, lest Satan should
usurp upon you; and they give this reason, because, say they, Theod. com. in 2
ad Cor. (...).
Satan has no right to any place; wheresoever he gets footing he is an
intruder and usurper: like Antiochus surnamed Hierax, the Hawke, who had no
estate or patrimony left him, but preyed upon others territories, and by rapine
patched out a kingdom to himself. Others read, lest Satan circumvent us,
agreeably to the circumstances of the place, and the practice of the devil;
who being demanded by God, Job. 1.7.
from whence he came, answered, from compassing the earth; and cur circuit,
nisi ut circumveniat? why does he compass the earth, but to circumvent us?
Circumvention is more easily understood, than prevented or avoided. A Wrestler
who can circumvenire, come about his adversary, takes hold where he list to
his best advantage: in a duel fought on horseback, he that can nimbly turn
his beast, and circumvenire, come about his Antagonist, he strikes him at
pleasure: when a passenger is met by a thief at every turn, he is properly
circumvented: when a city is environed and begirt with a puissant army, that is
circumvented, there is no hope to escape. By which few instances you may
perceive how apt this phrase is to express the great danger of Satan his
temptations. Yet the Kings Translation (lest Satan get advantage of us) comes
nearest to the Greek Etymology, which imports, to have more or the better, to
gain over and above: and Oecumenius the Greek Scholiast descanteth upon this
signification of the word after this manner: Oecumenius in 2 Cor. 2.11. (...);
Does not Satan gain over and above, when he gains upon us both ways, when
he gets an advantage of us both by sin and repentance, both by vicious
pleasures, and by godly sorrow? as he would have done upon this Corinthian,
whom first he persuaded to make an incestuous match, to satisfy his lustful
desires; and after he felt the smart of his sin, and severe censure of the
Church, he wrought upon his sorrow, and sought to drive him into desparation.

But why does the Apostle say, lest he get advantage of us? was Saint Paul in
any danger, or had Satan any design upon him? We may piously conceive that
Saint Paul joins himself with them, because he esteemed all those whom he
begot to Christ by the Gospel, no other than his own children; and the Father
cannot but suffer in the loss of his child. The Cypr. de laps. Plus pastor in
gregis sui vulnere vulneratur.
shepherd must needs be endamaged when any of his flock is diminished. 2 Cor.
11.29
Who is offended, says Saint Paul, and I burn not? yet this is not all, Saint
Paul was further interessed in this business than so: for the Corinthians had
excommunicated this incestuous person by order from the Apostle himself, and
therefore if he had miscarried, Satan had made his advantage upon all: upon the
incestuous person, whose soul he would have ruined; upon the Church, which
he had maimed of a member; upon the Corinthians, and S. Paul himself, under
whose hands this patient had been so roughly handled, that he died in the
cure. These were Satan's reaches, or as they are here called, devices; which he
could not carry so closely, but that the Apostles vigilant eye descryed them:
for, says he,

We are not ignorant of his devices. Did the householder know what night the
thief would come to rob him, he would certainly guard his house: did the birds
know a snare were laid for them, would they come near it? were the fishes
aware that a net were spread for them, would they run into it? had the
soldiers certain notice of an ambush set for them, would they be surprised?
Lo here, beloved, snares of temptation, nets of circumvention, ambushes of
destruction, prepared by a most subtle enemy, and we are not ignorant of them;
if then we be taken, entangled, or surprised, can we lay the blame upon any
thing but upon our careless and retchlesse folly? Could we plead with him in
the Poet, Non expectato vulnus ab host tuli; I was wounded by a dart I was not
aware of, our case deserved some compassion: but when we know our enemy, and
are foreshewed what fiery darts he prepares for us, and when and how he will
cast them at us, if we receive our deaths wound, our blood must needs be upon
our selves.

Satan assaults us two manner of ways, by his lions paw, and by his serpents
sting; by open force, and by cunning sleights; by the one in time of
persecution, by the other in time of peace: of the latter the Apostle here
speaks, saying, we are not ignorant of his

Devices. Devices are subtle means to compass our ends, such as are tricks
in gaming, fallacies in disputing, sleights in wrestling, mysteries in trading,
policies in state, and stratagems in war; the enemy of our soul is full of
them: -- cui nomina mill,
Mill nocendi arts. --
Lypsius has written of all the warlike engines used by the ancients, and
Vegetius of their military policies and Captaine-craft; but never any yet was
able to recount, much less describe all Satan's poliorcetickes and stratagems.
Some of the chief and most dangerous, partly out of scripture, and partly out
of experienced soldiers of Christ, I purpose to acquaint you with at this time.

1. The first stratagem, policy, or device of Satan is, To observe the natural
constitution of every man's mind and body, and to fit his temptations
thereunto. For he knows well, that as every plant thrives not in every
soil, so neither every vice in every temper and complexion. Though there be
in every man a general averseness from good, and propension to evil; and
albeit nature, as it is corrupted since the fall, be a step-dame to all
virtue, and a mother to all vices, yet she is not equally affected in every
one, to all her own children. Some ill conditions are more incident to some
climats, to some countries, to some families, than others. The Eastern people
were for the most part given to sorcery, the ancient Jews to idolatry, the
Greeks to curious heresy, the Latin Church to superstition. Unnatural lust
seems to be naturalized in Italy, pride in Spain, levity in France,
drunkenness in Germany, gluttony and new fangled fashions in great Britain.
Ambition haunteth the Court mostly, faction the University, luxury and usury
the City, oppression and extortion the Country, bribery and forged
cavillations the Courts of justice, schism and simony the Church. Pliny
writes of some families, that they had privy marks in their bodies, peculiar
to those of that line; the like may be found in men's minds: and every one
herein is like the Leopard, Cognatis maculis parcit fera: he Greg. mor. in
Job. l. 29. Prius conspersionem uniuscujusque intuctur, and post tentationum
laqueos apponit.
favors his own spots. These spots Satan curiously marketh, and accordingly
frames his suggestions: he observes our walks, and spies our usual haunts,
and there sets gins for us. As the Mariner marks the wind, and accordingly
hoiseth up or strikes sail: or as the cunning Orator learneth which way the
Judge propendeth, and ever draws him where he sees him coming on; so the
Devil makes perpetual use of the bent of our nature to help forward his
temptations, rightly considering that it is a very easy matter to bow a tree
the way it bends of it self, to cast a bowl swiftly down the hill, to push
down a wall where it swaggeth already, to trip up his heels whose foot is
sliding. He would find it a matter of some difficulty to tempt a flegmaticke
man to quarrelling and contention, a choleric man to sloth and
sluggishnesse, a melancholy man to excess of mirth, a man of a sanguine
complexion to over much sorrow, because the byas of their constitution carries
them to the contrary affections. What then does this crafty Sinon? he creeps
into the bosom of the choleric man, by adding fuel to his natural fire,
and whetting his desire of revenge; of the sanguine, by preparing a sweet bit
for his liquorish taste; of the flegmaticke, by making a down bed for him to
sleep in it securely; of the melancholy, by opening a spring to pensive
thoughts, and driving him along upon a full stream of sorrow into the gulf of
despair.

2. The second stratagem, policy, or device is, To observe our natural
abilities and endowments, and accommodate his temptations thereunto. Like a
cunning Poet he fits every actour with a part agreeable. Ex quolibet ligno non
fit Mercurius, Every piece of timber will not serve to carve Mercury on;
neither is every man fit to make an Arch-traytour or Heretic. He that will
be the ringleader of rebellion, had need be a man of great parts and power.
Such was Jeroboam in Israel, Cyrus the younger in the Persian state, Arbaces in
the Assyrian, Alcibiades and Themistocles in the Athenian, Hannibal in the
Carthaginian, the Gracchi, and Marius, and Cinna, and Sylla, and Catiline in
the Roman state. None but a man of a curious wit, and a prying Spirit into the
secrets of nature, would busy himself in astrologicall and magical
speculations: Satan therefore finding Zoroastres of old, and Cornelius Agrippa
of late, fitted for this purpose, used their brains and pens, under the
title of natural magic, or hidden philosophy, to commend sorcery,
figure-casting, and negromancy to the world. When Absalom went about to
dispossess his Father, a wise and puissant Prince, of his kingdom, he needed
a man of a deeper reach than his own to be his Counselor: therefore Satan
sends him Achitophel, the cunningest Politician that age afforded, whose
ungodly Maxims and state Aphorisms, fit for no Court but Lucifers in hell,
passed by tradition for the most part, till that Florentine monster Nicolaus
Machiavel committed them to writing. The invention and maintenance of heresy
is no work of a dull wit or illiterate apprehension; which the Father of lies
and all falsehood understanding, employed the subtilest Philosophers to devise
and defend impious novelties against the Orthodoxe faith. In which regard
Tertullian fitly terms Philosophers the Patriarchs of Heretics; from whom
we may derive the pedigree of Arrius, and Sabellius, and Coelestius, and
Pelagius, the fragments of whose works yet extant in the Fathers writings, show
the subtlety of their wits, and their excellent skill in sophistry. Neither was
Servetus much inferior to Arrius, nor Socinus to Coelestius, nor Gentilis to
Sabellius, nor Arminius to Pelagius, who in our days have uttered some of
their wares at second hand, setting only a new gloss of words upon them. As
Phillis in the Poet pitifully complains against Demophoon for flying away
from her in the fleet of ships she furnished him withal: Ovid op Phil.
Demophoonti.
Remigiumque dedi quo me fugiturus abires:
Heu patior telis vulnera facta meis.
so the Church and University have just cause to exclaim against her own
children of eminent parts, that they have given her the deepest wounds by those
weapons of art and authority wherewith she armed them.

The third stratagem, policy or device of Satan is, To accommodate his
temptations to men's outward estate, condition, and place; which much swayeth
either way. For you shall seldom hear of a man in high honor humble, or in
disgrace proud; in prosperity distrustful, or in extreme misery hopeful; in
wealth discontent, or in poverty patient; in abundance temperate, or in want
luxurious; in health and strength mortified, or in sickness lustful. Had not
the Philosopher, in the second of his Rhetorickes, taught us what impressions
these outward things make upon the mind, we might have read it in the Greek
and Latin proverbs, (...), Honores mutant mores. Who knows not that tyranny
is often incident to sovereignty, ambition to nobility, oppression to power,
insolency to wealth, and luxury to abundance, as contrary vices to contrary
fortunes? Whereupon the subtle spy of mankind suggesteth evil motions,
agreeable as well to our outward estate as our inward qualities: he shoots
his poisoned arrows always with the wind, that they may be carried with a
double force, the motion of the air and the strength of his arm; and hard it
is if he prevail not, when both our natural temper and parts, and our outward
condition and calling help forward his attempts against us. Adam was no sooner
made by God a Prince on earth, but he tempts him to aspire higher, even to
be like God himself the King of heaven; and this temptation takes, because
it well suited with Adams present honor and happiness. Nimrod was a mighty
man, Satan therefore tempts him to violence and tyranny; and his temptation
takes, because it met with a fit subject. Nebuchadnezzar was a great,
puissant, and magnificent Prince, Satan therefore tempts him to pride and
vainglory; and this temptation takes, because it was suitable to the high
quality of that Monarch. Joab was a great Commander in war, Satan therefore
tempts him to a bloody revenge on Abner his competitor; and this temptation
takes, because it fitted so well Joabs profession and present discontent.
Haman was King Asuerus his favorite, and could ill brook any to rise in the
Kings Court, Satan therefore tempts him to envy Mardocheus, and lay a plot
to destroy him and all the Jewish nation; and this temptation takes, because
it sorted well with the proud stomach of that Princes Minion. To conclude with
the worst of all men, Judas; Satan saw that he had the bag, and was basely
covetous, repining at any extraordinary expense, even upon his Masters person,
therefore he tempts him by money to betray his Master; and this temptation
took, because it so well agreed with Judas his disposition and employment.
Eutrapeles, as it seems, had good experience how men's inward minds changed
with their outward garb: for, -- Cuicunque nocere volebat
Vestimenta dabat pretiosa:
if he had aspleen at any, and intended to ruin them, he sent them rich and
costly apparel; not doubting but after they had put it on, they would withal
take upon them, and by their insolent carriage bring themselves into danger. We
cannot but smile when we read of Bucephalus, that when he had on his rich
caparisons, and held his golden bit between his teeth, he would suffer none to
mount upon him but Alexander; but when he was out of his costly trappings any
Page or Lackey might back him. Have we not greater reason, I will not say to
laugh at, but to pity the folly of most men, who, according to the words of
the Psalmist, Psalm. 49.20.
being in honor have no understanding, but may be compared to the beast that
perishes? Their purple robes are no sooner on but they reflect upon their own
worth and wisdom, and trample those who were before their equals, under foot.

4. The fourth stratagem, policy, or device is, To tempt us by method,
beginning with questionable actions, thence proceeding to sins of infirmity,
from them to wilful transgressions, after to heinous crimes, and last of all
to obstinacy and final impenitency. No wool or cloth is dyed purple or
scarlet at the first, but after diverse tinctures, at the last takes that
deepest dye: so does the soul scarlet and crimson sins, after many lesser
faults of an inferior dye or stain. Juven. Sat. 2
Nemo repent fuit turpissimus:

No man at one leap gets up to the top of all impiety: therefore Satan takes
him by the hand and leads him by these several steps; 1 An evil motion, plot,
or design. 2 The entertainment of it with some kind of approbation. 3 A
determination to pursue it. 4 A vicious action. 5 An evil habit or custom. 6
The defense or justification of his wicked course. 7 Glorying in it, and in a
reprobate sense.


He that hastily turns the pegge to wind up a treble to his pitch, will
sooner break the string than tune it; but if he strain it up by little and
little, he brings it without danger to the height. Had Satan at the first
dash tempted Saint Peter to forswear his Master, and curse himself,
doubtless the Apostle would have abandoned the suggestion, and defied the
tempter; who yet wrought upon him by degrees, and at length obtained his end.
First he cools his zeal, persuading him not to run upon danger; but if he
were resolved to see what would become of his Master, to follow him afar off:
when he comes slowly to the high Priests palace, he sets a damsel upon him
to question him, and upon a light apprehension of danger he gains from him an
unadvised denial; after, upon greater fear, a double and treble abnegation;
in conclusion an oath, to make good his former denials. If this grand Impostor
of the world, and cunning supplanter of souls meet with a man of a strict
conscience, who endeavors to walk uprightly before God; first he tries to
bring him to venture upon questionable actions, such things as may bear a
dispute whether they are sins or no, as statute usury (to take eight in the
hundred): legal simony (to buy the next advowson of a living, the Incumbent
lying desperately sick): customary sacrilege (to pay a certain rate for the
tithe, though far less in value than the due.) If he get thus much ground of
him, he easily presses him forward to commit some undoubted sins, but small
in the kind; as to let his eyes range about vain objects, to entertain a
wanton thought for a while, to keep from Church in foul weather, to salve a
fault with a hansome excuse, to mis-spend an hour or two with a friend in a
Tavern: after Satan has gained thus much of him, he will easily draw him
from making little account of small sins, to make small account of great. For
as the wimble bores a hole for the auger, so less sins make way for greater;
idleness for wantonness, lust for adultery, wrath for murder, lying for
perjury, errors for heresies, good fellowship for drunkenness and all
wickedness. Milo by carrying a calfe at the first, and after a bullock, was
able in fine to bear an ox. And it is storied of Mithridates King of Pontus,
that by taking weak poisons at the first, and by degrees stronger, in the end
he brought his body to that temper, that no poison could work upon him.
Effecit poto Mithridates saepe veneno,
Toxica ne possint saeva nocere sibi.


Thus custom in small sins at the first, and in greater after, makes us in
the end insensible of all. This rule of Satan's method extends farther than
private corruption in men's minds. For thus sensim sine sensu, tyranny,
heresy, and superstition overran the greater part of the Church. The Bishop of
Rome in the beginning contended but for a bare primacy of order, which
considering the great power of that City, being the seat of the Empire, was
without much difficulty yielded unto him: after he pretends to a little more,
viz. receiving the last appeals from the sentence of the other Patriarchs;
this Sozimus stickled for, alleging for it a Canon of the Council of Nice,
which the African Bishops proved to be forged. By Boniface the third his time
he durst to put in for the title of Universal Bishop, which he obtained,
though Plat. in. Bonif. 3. An. 666.
with much ado, through the Emperor Phocas his means, who murdered his
Master Mauritius. By virtue of this title his successor Vitalianus took upon
him to give spiritual laws to the whole Church; and after him Pope Hildebrand
to give temporal laws to Kings and Princes, to depose them at pleasure, and
to dispose of their crowns. As tyranny, so superstition and Idolatry stole
pedetentim into the Church. First to confirm Christians in the faith of the
resurrection, and to encourage them to constancy in their holy profession, in
the Church Liturgy there was some commemoration made of the dead; after this
commemoration succeeded anniversary panegyrickes in their commendation soon
after, public giving thanks to God for them by name; and last of all, direct
invocation of them. In like manner gross Idolatry crept into the Church. First
images and pictures of Saints were used in private for memory, history, or
ornament only; after, upon the like color of pretense in St. Epist. ex
Regist. 9 Adorate Imagin^s omnibus modis devita.
Gregory's days they were brought into the Church, with an express
prohibition of worshipping them. In the next age the worship of them was
enjoined by Pope Adrian in the second Synod at Nice; yet not for themselves,
but respectively only in regard of that which they represent: but now in our
age, since the Council of Trent, it is the tenent of the Roman Church, that
Images are to be worshipped for themselves, Bell. de imag. sanct. l. 2. c. 21.
Ut in se considerantur, non tantum ut vicem gerunt exemplaris; and farther the
Heathen go not in their Idolatry, nor the wiser of them so far.

5 The fifth stratagem, policy or device of Satan is to bring us from one
extreme to another: when our heart smites us for any grievous sin out of
detestation thereof, unless we walk circumspectly we are easily carried to
the opposite vice. With this engine Satan makes great batteries upon many
weak Christians, not only because it is a hard thing to hit the middle, but
because we are apt to think that the extremest opposition to that vice which
lies heaviest upon our conscience is the work of grace in us, not considering
that vices are not only opposed to virtues, but to vices also. Our way to
heaven is like the course of a ship in the Sicilian sea between two rocks
called the Symplegades, the one lying on the right hand, the other on the left;
between which the channel is so narrow, that few seek to decline the one but
they dash on the other. Incidit in Scillam qui vult vitare Charybdim. As those
that go upon ropes, or pass over a narrow bridge, if they be not exceeding
careful, when the body swayeth or the foot slippeth one way, by hastily
leaning too far the other way they fall irrecoverably: so if we be not very
watchful over our ways, in declining one vicious extremity, ere we are aware
we pass the middle, and are upon the other. I need not go far for an
instance; this Corinthian, before he fell into this snare of Satan, was puffed up
in pride, and sinned presumptuously; but after the heavy censure of the Church
for his incestuous marriage, and the remorse of his own conscience for it, he
fell into the contrary extreme, took on so far, and plunged himself into so
deep sorrow, that he was in great danger to be swallowed up in the gulf of
despair. Demea offended not so much in rigor toward his children at the the
first, as afterward in indulgency when he felt the smart of his own rod. None
usually so exceed in mirth, and run into that riot of pleasure as melancholy
men when they are out of that humor. This stratagem serves Satan's turn as
well in matter of faith as manners. For as vices are in both extremes, and
virtue in the middle; so oftentimes errors in doctrine are in both extremes
and truth in the middle: by overreaching against one heresy we wrong the
truth, hurt our selves, and fall upon the error in the other extreme. St. V^^
(...) t^^. C^g^^^ ca^^ J^ Regis.
Basil in his heat of opposition to Sabellius his heresy, was transported so
far, that he came within the Verge of the opposite heresy, and uttered some
inconvenient speeches concerning the Trinity. St. Austine likewise in his zeal
against the Pelagians, who sleightned baptism, went too far in urging the
necessity thereof, pronouncing all children that died unbaptized to be damned.
And how many are there among us, who out of hatred of the Antichristian
tyranny, condemn all Ecclesiastical Hierarchy? out of detestation of
superstitious rites, dislike even decent ceremonies? in opposition to garish
and idolatrous trimming of Temples, are brought to dis-allow all cost in
adorning and beautifying Christian Churches?

6 The sixth stratagem, policy or device of Satan is to turn himself into an
Angel of light, and thereby to persuade the children of light that his
suggestions are the motions of Gods holy Spirit. This he attempteth and often
effects by observing what gifts and graces are most eminent in Gods children,
and to what actions of piety or charity they are most addicted, and subtly,
under the color and resemblance of these, drawing them to those neighbor
vices that seem to have most affinity with their Christian perfections: like
as if a cunning Lapidarie should insinuate into the company of a rich Merchant,
and getting a sight of his cabbinet of Jewels, should cheat him with
counterfeit stones in stead of them. To discover this plot of Satan more
apparently: 1 Religion is a true jewel, Superstition a counterfeit: 2 Humility
a jewel, Pusillanimity a counterfeit: 3 Spiritual wisdom a jewel, Worldly
policy a counterfeit: 4 Magnificence a jewel, Prodigality a counterfeit: 5
Tenderness of conscience a jewel, Scrupulosity a counterfeit: 6 Severity a
jewel, Cruelty a counterfeit: 7 Clemency a jewel, Indulgence a counterfeit: 8
Zeal a jewel, Indiscreet fervor a counterfeit: 9 Diligent search into divine
mysteries a jewel, curiosity a counterfeit: 10 Inward peace a jewel, Carnal
security a counterfeit: 11 Confidence in God a jewel, Presumption a
counterfeit: 12 Constancy a jewel, Pertinacy a counterfeit.
Here then is Satan's masterpiece, to rob us of our precious jewels of grace,
and deceive us with counterfeit in their room; by name, to adulterate and
sophisticate the former virtues by the later vices: 1 Religion by Superstition.
2 Humility by Pusillanimity. 3 Spiritual wisdom by Policy. 4 Magnificence by
Prodigality. 5 Tenderness of conscience by Scrupulosity. 6 Severity by
Cruelty. 7 Clemency by Indulgence. 8 Zeal by Indiscreet fervor. 9 Diligence
by Curiosity. 10 Inward peace by Carnal security. 11 Confidence by
Presumption. 12 Constancy by Pertinacy.
Saul was most zealous for the law of Moses: this his fervor Satan inflaming
enraged him against the Apostles and Disciples, whom he as then thought to be
capital enemies to the law: in this his rage he makes havocke of the Church
of God, deeming that he could not do better service to God, than to be an
instrument to put to death the dearest servants of Christ. The great love St.
Cyprian the Martyr bare to the Orthodoxe faith, and the Professors thereof,
bred in him a vehement detestation of Heresy and Heretics: upon this Satan
works, and draws him by degrees to question, then to condemn their baptism,
and lastly to press the necessity of rebaptizing those that were baptized by
them. Theodosius his infinite desire of the Church's peace was a most
commendable and Christian virtue in him; yet Satan made his advantage of it,
working him to some connivence at the Arrians, which much prejudiced the
Orthodoxe Professors. Who can sufficiently extol Constantine the great his
love to Bishops and Churchmen? yet Satan abused this his pious respect to the
Clergy, in such sort that when diverse Bishops brought inditements one against
another, for adultery and other foul crimes, he never so much as looked upon
their papers, but presently burned them, saying, that rather than any should
epsy the nakedness of those his spiritual Fathers, he would cast his
Princely robe over them to cover them. Whosoever reads the story of St.
Monica, would think that a son could never do too much for such a mother,
who took so much pains, and shed so many tears for his conversion. Neither was
she more careful for him, than he thankful to her: and would you think that
Satan could suck poison out of so sweet a flower as is filial obedience to a
gracious mother? yet he does by inducing St. Austine to pray for her soul
after she was dead. How was he brought to this? Did he believe that his mothers
soul was in Purgatory, or that she needed any prayer? That conceit he
disclaimeth in the very same place where he prays for her, Credo quod jam
feceris quod te rogo, sed voluntaria oris mei opproba Domine. For Aug. Confess.
l. 9. c. 13.
my mother on her deathbed desired but this one thing of me, that I would
remember her in my devotions at thine Altar.

7 The seventh stratagem, policy or device of Satan is to make advantage of
time, not only by alluring every age to the peculiar vices thereof, as children
to idleness and vanity, youth to lust, perfect age and strength to violence
and audacious attempts, old age to covetousness, and every one to the sins
of the time: but making use of the present opportunity to thrust a man suddenly
into the next sin. When he had got Christ upon the pinnacle of the Temple, he
tempts him to cast himself down from it, to make experience of the Angels
care and diligence in waiting on him, and Mat. 4.6.
bearing him in their hands, that he dash not his foot against a stone. As
soon as David had spied fair Bathsheba bathing her self, he cast a fiery
dart of lust at him, and wounded him at the heart. Achans eyes were no sooner
dazzled with the luster of the rich Babylonish garment, but Satan closes with
him. And as by taking advantage of the present occasion he made Achan a
thief, so Gyges an adulterer, Ananias and Sapphira liars to the holy Ghost,
Judas a murderer of himself. If ever a Christian is like to be in any great
distress and trouble in mind, it is either in the travels of his new birth,
or when he labors for life at his last gasp; therefore Satan at these
times is most busy. In the beginning of our conversion nature is strong, and
grace is weak, and the practice of religious duties is uncouth unto us; then
therefore Satan sets upon us, and presents to us all our former pleasures, and
amplifieth upon the austerity of a Christian course of life. At the hour of
death he doubleth his files, not only because he is straightened in time, and
knows that either then he is to prevail, or never; but because many things
help his temptation, viz. the extremity of pain, the natural terror of
death, and apprehension of Christ's dreadful tribunal, before which the sick
party is presently to appear. Now therefore he sets upon a man in his
greatest weakness of body, and consternation of mind; he charge him with
all his sins secret and open, he exaggerateth the strictness of Gods
justice, and the unsufferable torments of hell: and if the dying man has not
prepared himself for this last conflict, or has not on the whole armor of
God, or cannot weild his buckler of faith, to quench all the fiery darts of the
Devil, it is great ods that he wi l get the upper hand of him, and bring him,
if not to dye desperately, yet most uncomfortably.

To launch out of these deepes of Satan, and steer toward the haven. Conclus.
and applicat.
The knowledge of evil is good, of fraud is honest, of errors is true, of
things that are most noxious wholesome; and therefore Logicians discourse
accurately of fallacies, Physicians of poisons, moral Philosophers of vices,
and Divines of heresies: not that we should use the first, or take the second,
or practice the third, or profess the fourth; but that we be not deceived by
the first, annoied by the second, infected by the third, seduced by the fourth.
And this was my first aim in laying before you these stratagems, policies, and
devices of our ghostly enemy, to forewarne you of them, that you be not taken
or hurt by them. But my chief was to instruct you how to employ his own
engines, and turn his own ordnance upon himself, to make treacle of his
poison, and use of serpentine wisdom against the serpent, after this manner.

1. First, does Satan play the Physiognomer, and observing our natural temper
fit his temptations thereunto? let us also make use of Physiognomy, and take
advantage of our natural inclinations to further the work of grace in us: If
we find our selves by nature timorous, let us endeavor to improve this fear
into awful reverence: if audacious, to improve this boldness into spiritual
confidence: if gladsom and merry, to improve our mirth into joy in the holy
Ghost: if choleric, to improve our wrath into zeal: if melancholy, to
improve our pensiveness into godly sorrow.

2. Secondly, does Satan play the Poet, and fit every Player with a part that
he is best able to act? let us also make use of Poetry, and observing our
natural abilities of mind and body, to fit our spiritual exercises
accordingly: If we are endued with pregnancy of wit, to employ it in the study
of heavenly mysteries: if with maturity of judgment, employ it in discerning
between the true and false Religion, and resolving intricate cases of
consciences: if with felicity of memory, employ it in treasuring up precious
doctrines: if with liberty of speech, employ it in prayer, praises and godly
exhortations: if with strength of body, and courage of mind, employ them in
fighting the Lords battles: if with wisdom, in prudently governing the
affairs in Church and Commonwealth.

3. Thirdly, does Satan play the Politician, and enquire into every man's estate
and condition of life, and accommodate his temptations thereunto? let us also
make use of policy, and by our outward estate better our inward, laboring for
those graces which are most proper for our place and condition. If we are in
authority, let us strive for gravity and integrity: if under the command of
others, for obedience and faithfulness: if in an eminent condition, for
magnanimity and magnificence: if in a low, for modesty and humility: if in
abundance, for charity and thankfulness: if in want, for frugality and
contentedness: if in prosperity, for temperance: if in adversity, for patience.

4. Fourthly, does Satan play the Logician, and tempt us by method? let us also
make use of Logic, and observe method in the science of salvation: let us
first acquaint our selves with the Catechism, and afterwith profounder
mysteries in Divinity; let us first practice easier, and after more difficult
duties of Christianity; first accustom our selves to bear lighter, and after
heavier crosses with patience: above all things to kill the cockatrice in the
shell, nip sins in the bud, to resist evil motions in the beginning, to make
a stop at every step by which Satan leads us: not easily to be brought to
venture upon any doubtful or questionable actions; if we have ventured upon
any, by no means to give consent to commit the least sin: if we have been
overtaken in the act of any sin, let us take special care we break it off
by speedy repentance, and make no custom of it: if through carelessness, or
conversation with wicked men we have gotten an ill custom, let Satan never so
far prevail with us as to stand in defense and justification thereof, much
less to glory in our evil courses; but let our heart smite us for them, and
let us never be at peace with our selves till we have driven out an iron
nail with a golden, an evil custom with a good.

5. Fifthly, does Satan play the false Pilot, and by persuading us to decline
from a rock on the right hand, carry us so far the contrary way that we
split our ship upon a rock on the left hand? let us also make use of the art
of navigation in our course to the fair havens in heaven: let us perfectly
learn our way, and all points of the Compass, and carefully steer by the
Card of Gods Word, and keep in the straight and middle way of Gods
commandments, neither declining to the right hand nor to the left.

6. Sixthly, does Satan play the crafty Merchant, and cheat us with counterfeit
stones for jewels, with shows of virtues for true graces? let us also imitate
the wisdom of Merchants, who will be perfect Lapidaries before they deal in
pearls and precious stones: let us study the difference between true and
seeming graces, and pray continually to God that we may abound more and more in
knowledge, and in all judgment, that we may be able to discern things that
differ, and try Spirits whether they are of God or no.

7. Lastly, does Satan play the temporizer, and time all his suggestions? let
us also in a pious sense be time-servers, let us perform all holy duties in
the fittest season, let us omit no opportunity of doing good, let us take
advantage of all occasions to glorify God, and help on our eternal
salvation. If we hear a bell toll, let us meditate on our end, and pray for
the sick lying at Gods mercy: if we see an execution, let us meditate on our
frailty, and reflecting upon our own as grievous sins (though not coming
within the walk of man's justice) have compassion on our brother: if we see
Lazarus lying in the street, let us meditate upon the sores of our conscience,
and our poverty in spiritual graces, and extend our charity to him: finally,
since we know at what time Satan most assaulteth us, let us be best provided at
those times, especially at the hour of our death; let us follow the advice of
Seneca, though a Heathen, Sen. ep. 2.
Quotidie aliquid adversus mortem auxilii compara, and cum multa percurreris,
unum excerpe quod illo die concoquas: lay up store for that day, every day
gather one flower of Paradise at least, that even when the fatal hour is
come, and the stench of death and rottenness is in our nostrils, we may have a
posie by us, in which we may smell a savor of life unto life: which God
grant, etc.

SERMONS PREACHED AT SAINT PAULSCROSSE, OR IN THE CHURCH.
THE BELOVED DISCIPLE. THE XXX. SERMON.
JOH. 21. 20. The Disciple whom Jesus loved, which also leaned on his breast at
Supper.


IF we must abstain from all appearance of evil in our civil conversation,
much more, certainly, in our religious devotion. For God is most jealous of his
honor, which is all he has from us for all we hold of him: Praef. Apolog.
fest. eccles.
and the straight rule of religion will in no wise bend to any obliquity on
either side; either by attributing any true worship to a false, or any false
worship to the true God. From both which aspersions he that sees not the
Liturgy established by law in the Church of England to be most clear and
free, either is short-sighted, or looks on her through a foul pair of
spectacles; and thereby ignorantly imagines that dust to be in her sacred
Canons and Constitutions, which indeed is not in them, but sticks in his
glassie eyes: let him but rub his spectacles and he shall see all fair, and
without any the least deformity or filth of superstition, as well in the
Service appointed for the Lords day, as for the Saints feasts. For though we
adorn our Calendar with the names of some eminent Saints, and make honorable
mention of them in our Liturgy, as the ancient Church did of her Martyrs,
Austin. de civ. Dei, l. 22. c. 10.
non tamen invocamus, yet we call not upon them, we lift not up our hands,
we bow not our knees, we present not our offerings, we direct not our
prayers, we intend not any part of religious worship to them, sed uni Deo and
martyrum and nostrum, but to their God and ours, as Saint Austine answers for
the practice of the Church in his time. Which may serve as a buckler to bear
off all those poisonous darts of calumny, which those of the concision cast at
that part of our Church Service, wherein upon the yearly return of the Feast
of the blessed Virgin, the Archangell, Apostles, Evangelists, Protomartyr,
Innocents, and All-holy-ones, we remember the Saints of God; but in no wise
make Gods of Saints: sanctificamus Deum, non deificamus Sanctos; we bless God
for them, we worship not them for God.

Although our devotion glanceth by their names, yet it pitcheth and is fixed
upon the Angel of the covenant, and sanctum sanctorum, the holy of all holy
ones, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. On the blessed Virgins anniversary we
honor him in his Mother: on Saint John Baptists we honor him in his
forerunner: on Saint Michaels we honor him in his Archangel (the Captain of
his celestial squadron): on the Apostles we honor him in his Ambassadors:
on the Evangelists we honor him in his Chroniclers: on Saint Stevens we
honor him in his Martyr: on S. John the Divine his day we honor him in his
beloved Disciple, who also leaned on his breast at Supper. 1 The Disciple. 2
The Disciple beloved. 3 Beloved of Jesus. 4 In Jesus bosom.


All Christians are not Disciples, this is the Disciple: all the Disciples were
not beloved, this is the beloved Disciple: all that are beloved are not beloved
of Jesus, this is he whom Jesus loved: lastly, all whom Jesus loved were not so
familiar with him, or near unto him, that they leaned on his breast: this was
his bosom friend, and, as the text says, at supper leaned on his breast.
Every word is here a beam, and every beam is reflected, and every reflection
is an intention of the heat of Christ's affection to Saint John. Divis.
1 A Disciple; there is the beam: 2 Ille, the, or that Disciple; there is the
reflection.
1 Beloved; there is the beam: 2 Beloved of Jesus; there is the reflection.
1 Leaning; there is the beam: 2 Leaning on his breast; there is the
reflection.


It is a great honor to be a Disciple, but a greater to be the Disciple: a
great honor to be beloved, a greater to be beloved of Jesus: a great honor
to lean on such a personage, a greater to lean on his breast.

Thus I might with an exact division cut the bread of life: but I choose rather
after the manner of our Savior, to break it, and that into three pieces
only, viz. John his 1 Calling in Christ. 2 Favor with Christ. 3 Nearenesse
unto Christ.
1 His calling in Christ, The Disciple. 2 His grace and favor with Christ,
whom Jesus loved. 3 His nearenesse unto Christ, who also leaned on his breast.


The Disciple. The Spouse in the Canticles setting out her husband in his
proper colors, says, Cant. 5.10.
My beloved is white and ruddy, that is, of admirable and perfect beauty: or,
white in the purity of his conversation, and ruddy in the hiew of his passion:
white in his life, and ruddy at his death; or, white in his garland of Cyp. l.
1. ep. 6. Floribus enim nec rosae nec lilia desunt, and pax and acies habet
suos flores quibus milites Christi ob gloriam coronantur.
lilies, unspotted Virgins; ruddy in his garland of roses, victorious Martyrs;
or lastly, as some flourish upon the letter, ruddy in all his Disciples (save
St. John) who shed their blood for his name and Gospel, and white in the
Disciple in my text, who alone came to a fair and peaceable end; abiding
(according to the words of our Savior) till he came unto him by an easy and
natural death. For this privilege Christ gave him above them all, that none
should have power to lay violent hands on him, who lay in his Redeemers arms.
Joh. 1.17.
The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth by Jesus Christ: and with
grace came in John, a name that signifies grace. We read of no John in the
old Testament, but we find two in the Gospel; the one the forerunner, the
other the follower of Christ; the one, in allusion to the Hebrew Etymology of
his name, may be called Gratia praeveniens, grace prevenient; the other Gratia
subsequens, grace subsequent; the one may be compared to (...) the Morning,
the other to (...), the Evening star: for Saint John Baptist, as the Morning
star, ushered in the Sun our Savior; Saint John the Evangelist, as the
Evening star, appeared long in the sky, shining in the Churches of Asia,
after the Sun of righteousness Christ Jesus was set, at his death. This
latter John is the Disciple whose feast we now keep, and memory we
celebrate, and graces we admire, and title we are now to declare. As Christ
spoke of the Baptist, Mat. 11.9.
What went ye out to see? a Prophet? nay I say unto you, and more than a
Prophet; we may say of this Evangelist: what are ye come to hear of? a
Disciple? nay I say unto you and more than a Disciple; a Prophet, an
Evangelist, an Apostle: Cic. in Brut. O generosam stirpein, and tanquam in unam
arborem plura germina, sic in istam domum multorum insitam et illuminatam
virtutem.
O noble stock, on which many grafts of the plants of Paradise are set! In
some parts of the sky we see single stars, in others a conjunction or
crown of many stars: the other Disciples were like single stars, some were
Prophets, some were Evangelists, some Doctors, some Apostles; but in Saint
John, as a constellation, shine the eminent gifts and callings of many
Disciples. Saint Luke was an Evangelist, but no Apostle; Saint Peter was an
Apostle, but no Evangelist; Saint Matthew was an Evangelist and Apostle, but no
Prophet; Saint John was all: 1 In his Gospel an Evangelist. 2 In his Epistle
an Apostle. 5 In his Apocalypse a Prophet.
And in all, according to his divine Hieroglyphicke, Rev. 4.7. The fourth beast
was like a flying Eagle.
An Eagle. He was an Eagle in his Apostolic function; Mat. 24.28. and Luke
17.37.
where the body was, there was this Eagle still lying at his breast. In his
Gospel like an Eagle he soareth higher than the other three, beginning with,
and more expressly delivering the divinity of Christ than any before him.
Lastly, in the Apocalypse like an Eagle with open eye he looks full upon the
Sun of righteousness, and the light of the celestial Jerusalem, whereat all
our eyes at this day are dazeled. Yet this divine Eagle here flies low, and in
humility touches the ground, stiling himself nothing but a Disciple.

Exodus 15.27.
Exodus, They came to Elim, where are twelve Wels of water, and seventy Palm
trees. In these twelve Springs of water Saint Hieron tract. de 42. mansionibus.
Nec dubium quin de Apostolis sermo sit, de quorum fontibus derivatae aquae,
totius mundi siccitatem rigant. Juxta has aquas 70. creverunt palmae, quas and
ipsos secundi ordinis intelligimus praeceptores, Luca Evangelista docente
duodecim fuisse Apostolos, and 70. Discipulos minoris gradus. Vid supr. Ser.
10. The Apostolic Bishop.
Jerome conceived that he saw the face of the twelve Apostles, and on the
branches of these seventy Palm trees, the fruit of the seventy Disciples
labor. In allusion whereunto, most of the Ancients make the Apostles the
Parents and patterns of all Bishops, and the seventy Disciples of Priests: the
Bishops they make as it were the springs, from whence the Presbyters, like the
Palm trees, receive sap and moisture, whereby they grow in the Church, and
bring forth fruit in the parochial Cures where they are planted. The Bishops
they called Pastors and Teachers primi ordinis, of the first order or rank:
the Presbyters or Priests Praeceptores secundi ordinis, teachers as it were in
a lower fourm. To confound which ranks in the Church, and bring a Bishop
perforce (...), down to the lower fourm or degree of a Priest, is defined
sacrilege in the great Council of Chalcedon. Yet Saint John the Apostle here
of himself descends into that lower step or staire, assuming to himself the
name only of a Disciple, 1 In humility: 2 In modesty: 3 In thankfulness to
his Master.


1 In humility to take all Christians into his rank, he gives himself no
higher title than was due to the meanest follower of Christ. The weightier the
piece of gold is, the more it presses down the scale; even so where there is
more worth, you shall ever find more lowliness: the empty and light ears
prick up, but the full bow to the earth.

2 In modesty Saint John was the youngest of the Apostles, and in that respect
terms himself rather a Disciple, that is, a learner, than as he was
indeed, a great Master in the Church: though he were (...), yet he was not
(...), young he was in years but not in conditions, his youth was wiser than
others age, his dawning was brighter than their noontide, his blossoms fairer
than their fruits, his Spring exceeded their Autumn; yet like Moses, he saw
not the beams of his face which all other beheld. Young men do not so much
usually overvalue themselves, as here Saint John does under-value himself:
the style wherewith the Church has most deservedly graced him, is (...), John
the Divine, but the title which he takes to himself is but (...), the
Scholar or Disciple.

3 In thankfulness to his Master he chooses this title before any other,
thereby professing that whatsoever knowledge he had, he sucked it from him on
whose breast he lay. About the time of our Saviors birth, as De vit. Pont. tit.

that by thy exposition clearly, which before they believed obscurely; yet be
sure to teach no more than thou have learned of Christ: though thou speak in a
new manner, yet deliver no new matter. If we teach not that which we have
learned of Christ, or teach any thing as needful to salvation, which we have
not learned of Christ, we hazard, if not lose, the name of Christians; for
Disciples of Christ and Christians are all one; no Disciple of Christ no
Christian, and every one so far a Christian as a Disciple of Christ. What
Christians then are Papists, whose Creed consisting of four and twenty
articles, twelve of them they learned of Christ, the other twelve of
Antichrist, as may be seen in the Bull of Pope Bu la S.D.N.D. Pii Papae quarti
super forma juramenti professoris affix. ad Conc. Trid. p. 439.
Pius affixed to the Council of Trent? Shall we simply affirm that they are
Christians? we wrong then our selves and all the reformed Churches who have
severed from them. Shall we absolutely deny that they are Christians? we wrong
them who hold with us the profession of the Trinity, the two Sacraments,
Baptism and the Lords Supper, and the three Creeds, the Apostles, the Nicene
or Constantinopolitane, and that of Athanasious. Although the Roman Cardinal
might justly be blamed, who caused his Painter to draw King Solomon half in
heaven and half in hell: yet I suppose they could not justly be censured, who
should draw Popery or the Church of Rome, as she is at this day, partly in
heaven, and partly in hell; in heaven in respect of those heavenly truths
which she maintains with us against Atheists, Jews, Turks, and all sorts of
Infidels, and many ancient Heretics; but in hell in respect of many
pernicious and hellish errors, which she pertinaciously defends against the
clear letter of Scripture, and doctrine and practice of the Primitive Church.
The blessed Apostle resolves a like question concerning the Jews, who
received the Old Testament, but rejected the New in a like manner: Romans 11.28.
As concerning the Gospel they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the
election they are beloved for the Fathers sake. We can hardly come off this
controversy upon better terms than these, that Papists, as concerning the
principles of the common faith, are Christians; but as touching their proper
errors by addition to it, detraction from it, corruption of it, they are no
Christians. You will say this is no simple or direct answer: neither need it so
to be, because the question is not simple. As it is superfluous to give a mixed
or double answer to a simple question, so it is dangerous to give a simple and
single answer to a mixed question, or a question of a mixed subject. 1 For
instance, let the question be concerning Ayat the Jew, who used indifferently
either of his hands as we use our right hand; Whether was he a right handed or
a left handed man? 2 Or concerning a part of speech, which takes part of a
noune, and part of a verb: Whether is it a noune or a verb? 3 Or concerning a
Myrmaid, which in the upper part resembles a maid, in the lower a fish:
Whether is it a fish or a maid? 4 Or concerning the Muscovy Monster, which
feeds like a sheep, yet grows like a plant, and has his root affixed to
the earth: Whether is it a beast or a plant? 5 Or concerning an Androgyne, that
has in it both sexes: Whether is it a man or a woman? 6 Or concerning the
apple mentioned by Seneca, that has in it a middle kind of taste, bitterish
at first, and sweetish at last: Whether is it a sweet or a bitter fruit?

To the first we must not answer simply, that he was a right handed or left
handed man, but as the Historian terms him, an Ambodexter.

To the second we must not answer simply, that it is a noune, or a verb, but
as the Grammarians call it, (...), participium, a participle.

To the third we must not answer simply, that it is a maid, or a fish, but with
the Poet a Siren; in some respect a maid, in some a fish. Prima hominis facies,
and pulchro corpore virgo
Pube tenus, postrema immani corpore pistrix.


To the fourth we must not answer simply, that it is a plant, or a beast, but
with the Geographer, a Plantanimall.

To the fifth we must not answer simply, that it is a man, or a woman, but with
the natural Philosopher, an Hermaphrodite.

To the sixth we must not answer simply, that it is a sweeting, or a bitter
apple, but with Seneca, that it is pomum suave-amarum, a bitter-sweet.

So if the question be of a Christian by profession of all or the most
fundamental points, who yet holds some heretical opinion, we must not
answer simply, that he is a Christian, or a Miscreant, but a Miscreant or
mis-beleeving Christian. Some write of the River Jordane, that the water
thereof is sweet, and that store of fish breed and live in it: others, that it
is brackish, yea and venomous also, in such sort that no fish can live in it;
and both write most truly in a reference to diverse parts thereof. For all that
is behether the lake Asphaltites is most sweet and wholesome; all that is
beyond it is salt and brackish, and in some places poisonous: and accordingly
the fish that swim not beyond the lake, or tasting the water salt, return
speedily back to the sweet springs, live: but if they are carried farther with
a full stream into Mare mortuum, or the dead sea, they instantly perish. What
then? shall we deny Jordan, in which Christ himself was baptized, to be a
sweet river? or do we doubt but that the doctrine of the Church of Rome, like
the river Jordan, is sweet in the spring, I mean the Font of baptism, in which
so many thousands of our fathers were christened? or that good Christians may
live the life of grace there, so long as they keep within the bounds of the
common Principles of Christianity; or if they have tasted some of the brackish
waters, the errors of popery, if yet they return back to the springs of holy
Scripture, may they not recover? questionless they may: but if they pass over
the lake Asphaltites, and swim with the full current into the midst of the
Mare mortuum of Antichristian errors, superstitions, and Idolatries, and are
not taken up in the net of the Gospel, before the venomous water has sunk
into their heart and bowels, and corrupted all their blood, we can have
little, if any hope of their safety. Those that are such, and have a resolution
to continue such, I leave In mari mortuo, in the sea of death, and come to the
Disciple in the bosom of Jesus the Fountain of life, even that Disciple

Whom Jesus loved. Did Jesus love him only? did he not love all his Apostles,
save Judas, to the end? nay, does he not love us all with an endless love?
Joh. 10.11.
Surely greater love than this can no man show, to lay down his life for his
friend. Is not he the good Shepherd that gave his life for the sheep? did he
not lay down his life for us all? did one of us cost him more than another?
shed he not as much and as pure life blood for one as for another? does the
Sun of righteousness shine brighter upon one than another? in perfection of
love can there be any remission or intention? in that which is infinite are
there any degrees? can any thing be said to be more or less infinite? The
determination of this point depends upon the consideration of our blessed
Savior: 1 As God. 2 As Man. 3 As Mediator.
As God his love is his nature, and his nature is himself, Solut.
and himself is infinite, and in that which is infinite no degrees can be
distinguished. As Mediator he seems to be like the Center, from which all
lines drawn to the circumference are equal; he casts the like beams of
affection, if not upon all, yet certainly upon all his Elect; for whom he
prayed jointly, and satisfied entirely, whom he washes equally in the same
Font of Baptism, feeds equally with his blood, incorporateth equally in his
body, and makes equally coheires with him of his kingdom in heaven.
Notwithstanding as man he might, and did affect one more than another, and in
particular he loved John more than the rest of his Disciples. Neither is it
any disparagement at all to our discretion or charity, to enlarge our hearts
more to one than another, if the cause be not a by or carnal respect, but a
different measure of gifts; if those be more in our grace, in whom Gods graces
shine brighter. Saint Paul had his Barnabas, Saint Austine his Alypius, Saint
Jerome his Heliodorus, Saint Bernard his Gervafius, Saint Basil his Nazianzene,
Eusebius his Pamphilus, David his Jonathan, and Jesus here in my text his
beloved Disciple. But here Saint Austine puts in a curious Quere; Why did
Jesus love John best, since it should seem Peter loved Jesus best? else why
does Christ say unto him, Tract. 124. in Joh.
love thou me more than these? He who more loved Jesus is the better, but
he whom Jesus more loves is the happier. To avoid this seeming jarre in
Christ's affections, S. Austin streineth up the plain history to a mystery:
Saint Peter, says he, was a type of the Church militant, Saint John of the
triumphant: now the Church militant expresses more love to Christ, in fighting
his battles, and suffering for him; but Christ manifests more love to the
Church triumphant, crowning her with celestial glory: in this life, like
Peter, we more show our love to Christ; in the other Christ shows more love
to us, as he did here to Saint John. These conceptions of that seraphicall
Doctor, like a wax light newly blown out, yield a sweet savor, and have
much heat in them of pious affection, but little light of knowledge. For as
Christ's love to us is consummate in heaven at the Lambs marriage, so is then
our love most complete in him. And for the two Disciples, Saint Peter and Saint
John, between whom there was never any contention greater than this, Whether
should more love our Savior; we may safely resolve, that though both
exceedingly loved him, yet (if we must needs enter into a comparison between
them) that the odds is on Saint John's side. For doubtless he whom Christ
more loved, he found or made him more thankful: the ground of our Saviors
love could be no other than grace, and he who has a greater measure of grace,
must needs more love the Fountain of grace, Christ Jesus. As Jesus therefore
more loved John, so John more loved Jesus; he followed him boldly to the high
Priests hall, he never denied him once, as Peter did thrice; he with his
mother attended him at the cross, and from that day took the blessed Virgin
to his own home; and therefore though Christ promised the keys of heaven to
Peter first, yet he gave Saint John a greater privilege, to lean on his
breast.

Which leaned on his breast. Of Saint John's leaning on Christ's breast four
kinds of reasons are given: 1 A civil by Calvin. 2 A Moral by Theophylact. 3
A mystical by Saint Austine. 4 A tropologicall by Guilliandus.
Though, says Calv. in Harmon.
Calvin, for a servant to lie on his masters breast may seem unseemly, yet the
custom of the Jews being not to fit at table, as we do, but at their meals
to lie on beds or carpets on the ground; it was no more for Saint John to lie
on Christ's breast, than with us to sit next to him: unless with Theophylact we
conceive, that Saint John upon the mention of our Lords death, and that by
treason, took on most grievously, and beginning to languish through grief,
was taken by Christ into his bosom to comfort him: or we interpret with Saint
Austin, and others of the Ancients, Sinum Christi, Sapientiae secretum; the
bosom of Christ, the cabinet of celestial jewels, or treasury of wisdom;
and infer with Saint Ambrose from thence, In psalm. 118. Johannes cum caput
suum super pectus domini reclinaret, hauriebat profunda secreta sapientiae.
That John when he laid his head to Christ's breasts, sucked from thence the
profound secrets of wisdom: and with Beda in Evang. Johan. Quia in pectore
Christi sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae and scientiae reconditi, merito super
pectus ejus recumbit quem majore caeteris sapientiae and scientiae singularis
munere donat.
Beda, That Christ revealed to Saint John as his bosom friend, more secrets;
and that the reason why his writings are more enriched with knowledge,
especially of things future than the rest, is, because he had free access to
Christ's breast, wherein all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge were hid.
Moreover, as Guil. com. in Johan. c. 21.
Guilliandus observes, S. John lay upon Christ's breast for the same reason
that Moses appointed in the law the breast of all sacrifices for the Priest: to
teach us, that wisdom and understanding, whose seat is the breast and heart,
ought to be the special portion of the Priests.

Among so many ingenuous reasons of this gesture of Saint John, if we lean to
Saint Austines opinion, the use we are to make of it is, with reverence and
religious preparation to read and hear all the books of holy Scripture, and
especially Saint John's writings, who received those hidden and heavenly
mysteries in Jesus his bosom, which Jesus Joh. 1.18. No man has seen God at
any time: the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father has
revealed him.
heard in his Fathers bosom. All Scriptures are given by 2 Timothy 3.16.
divine inspiration, and are equally pillars of our faith, anchors of our hope,
deeds and evidences of our salvation; yet as the heaven is more starry in one
part than another, and the seas deeper in one place than another, so it is
evident that some passages of Scripture are more lightsome than others, and
some books contain in them more profound mysteries and hidden secrets; and most
of all S. John's Gosspell, and his Apocalypse, wherein, by Saint Jeromes
reckoning, the number of the mysteries near answers the number of the words,
quot verba tot sacramenta.

If we like of Theophylact his reason, we are from thence to learn, not to
add affliction to the afflicted, not to vex them that are wounded at the
heart; but to stay with flaggons, and comfort with apples those that are in a
spiritual swoune, and by no means to withhold from them that faint under the
burden of their sins, the comforts of the Gospel to support them; especially
considering, that he as well kills a man who ministers not to him in due
time those things which may hold life in him, as he that slays him down
right.

Lastly, if we stick with Calvin to the letter, it will discover unto us the
error of many among us, that contend so much for sitting at the Communion, and
a table gesture (as they speak); whereas Christ at his last Supper neither
sat nor used any table at all. In eating of the Passover we read Mat. 26.20.
(...). Mark. 14.18. (...). Luke 22.14. (...).
(...), that Christ with the twelve fell down, or lay down after the Jewish
manner, which was nearer to kneeling than sitting. But what gesture precisely
he used in the delivery of the holy mysteries, it is not expressed in
Scripture: most probable it is that he kneeled, or at least that the Apostles
kneeled when they received the sanctified Elements from him. For no doubt they
who in the first ages immediately succeeded the Apostles, received the Communion
as the Apostles manner was; and that they kneeled, the heathen cavil against
them, that they worshipped bread and wine, makes it in a manner evident. For
had they sat or stood in the celebration of the Sacrament, the Gentiles could
have had no color to cast an aspersion of bread-worship on them: but because
in receiving the sacred elements of bread and wine, they kneeled down, and
religiously called upon God, the Paynims conceived that they adored the
creatures of bread and wine. And they among us who cannot distinguish between
kneeling at the Sacrament, and kneeling to the element; bread worship and the
worship of Christ, in religiously and reverently participating the holy
mysteries of his body and blood, are as grossly ignorant in Christian rites as
the ancient heathen were. Verily did they consider seriously who it is that
under the form of bread and wine offers unto them his body and blood, even
Christ himself by his Spirit, and what they at the same time in a thankful
love offer to God, their bodies for a holy and living sacrifice, and what then
they receive, a general pardon of all their sins under the seal of the King
of heaven; I persuade my self their hearts would smite them, if they strived
not to receive so great a benefit from so gracious a Majesty, as in the most
thankful, so in the most humble manner. But it is not the position of your
bodies, but the disposition of your minds, which in this rare pattern of my
text I would commend to your Christian imitation.

The best keeping the Feast of a Saint, is to raise him as it were to life, by
expressing his virtues and graces in ours: do you desire my brethren to be
John's, gracious in the eyes of your Redeemer? make much of those things for
which he was so much made of; love those virtues above others, which made him
beloved above others; deck your souls with those jewels, the beauty whereof
enamoured the Son of righteousness; which are three especially: 1 The
Emerauld, the emblem of chastity. 2 The Ruby, the emblem of modesty. 3 The
Carbuncle, the emblem of love.


Chastity is resembled by the Emerauld, which, as Rueus lib. de geminis, cap.
de smaragd.
Rueus writes, has a singular virtue to cool the heat of lust; and in this
stone was the name of Levi engraven, who revenged the wrong done to the
chastity of his sister by the Vid. infr.
Shechemites.

Modesty is resembled by the Ruby, in whose color the hue of that virtue
appears. And who cannot see in the glowing fire of the Carbuncle, the
ardencie of love? Saint Jerome attributes the overflowing measure of Christ's
love to Saint John, to his chastity; Saint Chrysostom to his modesty, Aquinas
to his love of Christ.

Saint John lived and dyed a Virgin, and if we will believe the Ancients, the
cleerenesse of his complexion answered the purity of his conversation, and
beauty of body and mind met here in one. The beauty of the body is fair and
brittle, like crystal glass; but if the gift of spiritual chastity be
incident to it, like the beams of the sun it: is most lovely in the eyes of
God and man. Eriphile was so taken with the sparkling of an orient jewel
exhibited to her, that for it she sold her loyalty to her husband, a far more
precious jewel. Take heed, Beloved, lest for favor of great ones, or worldly
honor, or earthly treasure, you put away that jewel, which if you once part
withal you can never recover again. There can be nothing more hateful to
him that was borne of a pure Virgin, continued a Virgin all his life, and now
in heaven is attended by Virgins ( Apoc. 14.4.
These are they which were not defiled with women, for they are Virgins; these
are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes:) than to make his
members the members of an harlot.

We have had the glympse of the Emerauld; let us now view the Ruby, Saint
John's modesty; who, though he might glory truly, if any, in the spirit, For
he had seen with his eyes, and heard with his ears, and handled with his
hands the Word of life: he was an eyewitness of Christ's transfiguration, one
of the three Gal. 2.9.
pillars mentioned by Saint Paul; he was a Prophet, an Evangelist, and an
Apostle, and in greater grace with his Lord and Master than any of the rest,
yet he will be known of no more than that he was a Disciple, he concealeth
his very name. The modest opinion of our knowledge is better than knowledge,
and humility in excellency excels excellency it self. That stone is most
resplendent which is set off with a dark foil; modesty is the dark foil
which gives luster to all virtues. How many, says Seneca had attained to
wisdom if they had not thought so, and therefore given over all search after
it? how many had proved men of rare and singular parts, if they had not known
them too soon themselves? Moses face shined, but he knew not of it; the
blessed of the Father at the day of judgment shall hear of their good works,
but they shall not acknowledge them, but answer saying, Mat. 25.38.39.
Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
or in prison, and ministered unto thee? If we take no knowledge of our good
parts, God will acknowledge them; but if like Narcissus we know and admire our
own beauty, this very knowledge will metamorphize us, and make us seem
deformed in the eyes of God and man.

We have viewed the Ruby, let us now cast a glaunce on the Carbuncle, the
third precious stone, Saint John's love to Christ. The maine scope of his Gospel
is Christ's love to us, and the argument of his Epistles our love one to
another. As he is styled the beloved, so he might well be called the loving
Disciple: as he was one of the first that came to Christ, so he was the last
that left him; he was never from his side, I had almost said out of his
bosom. Out of confidence of his loyal affection to his Lord, when neither
Peter nor any of the rest durst, he was bold to enquire of our Savior, Joh.
13 25.
who is it that shall betray thee? He follows Christ to the high Priests
hall, to the judgment seat, and to the cross, where our Lord commended his
Joh. 19.26. Woman behold thy son. Ver. 27 Then said he to the Disciple,
behold thy Mother.
Mother to him, and him to his Mother, and his soul to his Father. Love is the
lodestone of love, that love that drew Saint John's heart to Christ drew
Christ's to him. If thou desire above all things that Christ should love thee,
love him above all things: love him with all thy heart, whose heart was pierced
for thee: love him with all thy soul, whose soul was made an offering for
thee: love him with all thy strength, who for thee lost not only his strength
but life also.

Yea, but you may say, how can we now show our love to Christ? he is in
heaven, and our bounty cannot reach so high; we have him not here to offer
gold, myrrh, or frankincense, as the wise men did; or minister to him of our
substance, as some religious women did; or break a box of precious ointment,
and pour it on his head, as Mary did; or feast him, as Simon did; or wrap his
corpse in fine linen, as Joseph did; we have not his mother with us, to keep,
cherish, or comfort her, as Saint John did: yet we have his Spouse, his Word,
his Sacraments, his Disciples, his mystical members; and if out of sincere
love to him we honor his Spouse the Church; we frequent his house, the
Temple; we delight in his Word, the Scriptures; we come reverently and
devoutly to his board, the Communion Table; we give countenance and
maintenance to his Meniall servants, the Ministers of the Gospel; and relieve
his afflicted members, the poor and oppressed among us, we shall be as John's
to him, gracious in his eyes; Disciples, nay, which is more, beloved Disciples;
yea so beloved, that to our endless rest and comfort, we shall lie in his
bosom, not on earth, but in heaven. Which he grant unto us, who Apoc. 1.5.6.
loved us, and washed our sins in his blood, and made us Kings to command,
and Priests to offer our dearest affections unto him. To whom, etc.

THE ACCEPTED TIME: OR THE YEAR OF GRACE. THE XXXI. SERMON.

sprang in the womb of Elizabeth, so I doubt not but that at the reading of
this text in your ears, the fruits of your devotion, which are your religious
thoughts and zealous affections, leap and spring for joy in the womb of your
soul; for now is the accepted time, the time of grace: now is the day of
salvation, the day of our Lords Incarnation. As the golden tongued Father spoke
of a Martyr, Martyrem dixisse laudasse est, to name a man a Martyr is to
commend him sufficiently: so it may be said of this text, to rehearse it is to
apply it. I need not fit it to the time, for the time falls upon this time,
and the day upon this day: now if ever is this Now in season. If any time in
all the year be more acceptable than other, it is the holy time we now
celebrate: now is the accepted time on Gods part, by accepting us to favor:
now is the day of salvation, by exhibiting to us a Savior in our flesh: let us
make it so on our parts also by accepting the grace offered unto us, and by
laying hands on our Savior by faith, and embracing him by love, and by joy
dilating our hearts to entertain him, with all his glorious attendants, a
troop of heavenly Soldiers, singing, Luke 2.14.
Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, and good will toward men. Esaias 49.13.
Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into shouting, O ye
mountains: for God has comforted his people, and will have mercy upon the
afflicted. Keep this holy day above others, because chosen by God to manifest
himself in the flesh, bid by an Angel, and by him furnished both with a
lesson and with an Anthem also. Well might the Angel, as on this day, sing
glory in excelsis Deo, etc. for on this day the Son of God, out of his good
will toward men, became man, and thereby set peace on earth, and brought
infinite glory to God in the highest heavens. Well may this be called by the
Apostle, Gal. 4.4.
The fullness of time, or a time of fullness, which filled heaven with glory,
the earth with blessings of peace, and men with graces flowing from Gods good
will. The heavens which till this time were as clasped boxes, now not able
longer to contain in them the sovereign balsamum of wounded mankind, burst
open: and he whose name is Cant. 1.3.
an ointment poured forth, was plentifully shed upon the earth, to revive the
decayed spirits, and heal the festered sores of wounded mankind. Lift up then
your heavy looks, and heavier hearts, ye that are in the midst of danger,
and in the sight, nay within the claspes of eternal death; you have a Savior
borne to rescue you. Cheer up your drouping and fainting spirits, all ye that
feel the smart and anguish of a bruised conscience and broken heart; to you
Christ is borne to anoint your wounds, bruises and sores. Exult and triumph ye
gally slaves of Satan, and captives of Hell, fast bound with the chain of your
sins; to you a Redeemer is borne to ransom you from spiritual thraldom.

Two reasons are assigned why festivities are religiously to be kept.

1. The special benefits of God conferred upon his Church at such times, which
by the anniversary celebration of the days are refreshed in our memories, and
visibly declared to all succeeding ages.

2 The express command of God, which adjoined to the former reason, makes the
exercises of devotion, performed at these solemnities, duties of obedience.

It cannot be denied that in this latter consideration those feasts which are
set down in the book of God, have some prerogative above those that are found
wrtiten only in the Calendar of the Church. But in the former respect no day
may challenge a precedencie of this, no not the Sabbath it self, which the
more to honor him whose birth we now celebrate, resigned both his name, place
and rites to the Athanas. hom. de semenie. (...).
Lords day: and if we impartially compare them, the work wrought on this day
was far more difficult, and the benefit received upon it, greater than that,
to the memory whereof the Sabbath was at the first dedicated. It was a greater
miracle that God should be made a creature, than that he should make all
creatures: and the redemption of the world so far exceeds the creation, as
the means by which it was wrought were more difficult, and the time larger: the
one was finished in six days by the commandment of God, the other not in
less than four and thirty years by the obedience of Christ: the one was but
a word with God, the breath of his mouth gave life to all creatures; the other
cost him much labor, sweat and blood: and what comparison is there between an
earthly and an heavenly Paradise? Nay, if we will judge by the event, the
benefit of our creation had been none without our redemption. For by it we
received an immortal spirit, with excellent faculties, as it were sharp and
strong weapons, wherewith we mortally wounded our selves, and had
everlastingly laid weltring in our own blood, had not our Savior healed our
wounds by his wounds and death, and raised us up again by the power of his
resurrection. To which point Saint Austine speaking feelingly says, Si natus
non fuisset, bonum fuisset si homo natus non fuisset, If he had not been
borne, it had been good for man never to have been borne: if this accepted
time had not come, all men had been rejected: if this day of salvation had not
appeared, we had all perished in the night of eternal perdition.

Behold now is the accepted time. In this Scripture as in a Dyall we may
observe, 1 The Index, 2 The Circles, Certain, Behold. Different: 1 The larger,
2 The narrower, The accepted time. The day of salvation.



To man in general it is an accepted time, to every believer in particular it
is a day of salvation. Lynx cum cessat intueri, cessat recordari: Because we
are like the Lynx, which minds nothing no longer than her eye is upon it, the
Spirit every where calls upon us to look or behold: Behold, not always or
at any time, but now, not (...), but (...), not (...), but (...); not (...),
but (...): not time simply, but season, the flower of time; not barely
accepted, but according to the original, well accepted, or most acceptable;
not the day of help or grace, but a day of salvation. As in the bodies which
consist of similar parts, the form of the whole, and the form of every part
is all one; for example, the whole ocean is but water, and yet every drop
thereof is water; the whole land is but earth, and yet every clod thereof is
earth; the whole stone is but a diamond, and yet every carrect thereof in it is
diamond; the whole wedge is but gold, and yet every plate, every smallest foil
or raye is gold; and as the soul of man is tota in toto, and tota in qualibet
part corporis, is whole in the whole, and whole in every part of the body; so
there is season in the whole text, and in every part thereof: for there is
season, and that instant in now; there is season, and that welcome in accepted
time; lastly, there is season, and that most welcome in the day of salvation.
In the Esaias 49 8.
accepted time I will hear thee, in the day of salvation I will help thee.
This (I will hear thee) is as it were the noise of heavenly music afar
off: Behold the accepted time, this sounds like music at our gate; but now
is the day of salvation, this is like music at our ears.

Behold the accepted time, the day star begins to appear: Behold the day
of salvation, the sun is risen: Behold now is that time, now is that day, the
sun is directly over our heads, it is now high noone.

Behold is as a larum bell of attention, now is as a finger of indication or
application to a season: 1 Indefinite, a time of acceptance. 2 Definite, or
singular, a day of salvation:
That for information, this for our consolation.

Behold is as a star or hand in the margent pointing to some excellent matter.
In the Scripture we find four sorts of Ecce's:

1 An Ecce of demonstration, as Joh. 19.5.
Behold the man.

2 An Ecce of admiration, as Mat. 2.9.
Behold the star.

3 An Ecce of affection, as Joh. 1.47.
Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guilt.

4 An Ecce of excitation or attention, as 1 Cor. 15.51.52.
Behold I show you a mystery: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpe. The
Rabbis write of David's harp that it sounded of it self, by the wind only
blowing on it, without the touch of any string: it were to be wished that our
heart strings were like his harp strings, and would give a sweet sound by the
wind only of the Spirit blowing on them, without any touch of an Ecce of
excitation or increpation: but so it is, that though our soul be full of
divine graces, like Argo's eyes, yet Mercury with his enchanted rod, the world
with fascinating pleasures, or the Siren of our flesh with her effeminate songs
closes them all; and we need an Ecce, like the Act. 12.7.
Angels stroke on Peter's side, to awake us out of our dead sleep. A strange
thing it is that our eyes should be open, and we run with all speed
sometimes before day out of doors, to see a May Game, or a Masque, or a
Pageant, or a Morrice-dance, and yet we should need to have an Ecce to stir
us up, and pluck open, as it were, our eyelids to behold the light of heaven,
and the glory of the celestial Paradise. We listen willingly to wanton
music, and lascivious songs, but must be pulled by the ear to listen to the
sacred songs of Sion. Beloved, did you fasten your attention, did you
thoroughly consider of, what you cannot but hear again and again, unless
with the deaf adder you stopped your ears, something would stick by you; all
our sermons, all our admonitions, all our reprehensions, all our consolations
should not be like letters written in sand, or the tracke of a ship in the
sea, or of a bird in the air, or of a serpent upon a stone, whereof there
remains no print at all. Saint Hierome speaking of an Imperial law
restraining the luxury of the Clergy; The law, says he, is good, but this is
not good, that the manners of the Clergy were so dissolute that they needed
such a coercive law: Bonum cauterium, sed vae nobis quod indigeamus tali
cauterio: so it may be said of these Ecce's, or Beholds in Scripture, that
they are good, and of singular use, but it is great pity that we should need
them: it is a sign that our spiritual man is very drowsy, if not in a dead
sleep, that the Spirit calls so often, and so loud upon us, sometimes

1 To awake our faith: as, Esaias 7.14.
Behold a Virgin shall he with child, and shall bring forth a son, and thou
shall call his name Emanuel.

2 To awake our hope: as, Apoc. 22.12.
Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man as his
works shall be.

3 To awake our love: as 1 John 3.1.
Behold what love God has shown unto in, that we should be called the
sons of God.

4 To awake our fear: as Apoc. 1.7.
Behold he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also
which pierced him, and all kindreds of the earth shall veil before him.

5 To awake our joy: as, Luke 2.10.11.
Behold I bring you tidings of exceeding great joy, which shall be to all
people, that to you is borne this day in the City of David a Savior, which is
Christ the Lord.

6 To awake our thankfulness: as, Psalm. 134.1.
Behold, now praise the Lord all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand
in the house of the Lord.

7 To awake our compassion: as, Lam. 1.12.
Behold if there were ever sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord has
afflicted me in the day of his fierce wrath.

8 To awake our diligence and industry in eager and speedy pursuing the means
of our salvation, as here in my text: Behold, now is the accepted

Time. Other things are with more ease described than understood; but time is
easily understood, not described or defined so easily: there is no rusticke so
rude who understands not what you mean when you speak of time, yet never
any Philosopher to this day has exactly defined or described it. Aristotle
makes an essay in his Physickes, determining time to be Numerum motus secundum
prius and posterius, The number of motion or motion numbered according to the
former or latter parts thereof: but he fails in this his definition. For
questionless time is as well the measure of rest as of motion: we sleep as
well in time as we work in time. And as a ship in the Sea, whether the
passengers lie in their cabbins or walk on the deckes, holds on her course;
so whether we sleep or wake, labor or be at our ease, the time of our life
goes on. When Josuah commanded the Sun to stand still in the heavens, all the
motions of the celestial bodies ceased, yet was there then time, wherein that
noble General accomplished his victory. The Platonicks definition is truer,
who say that time is eternity limited, but yet no way perfect. I grant time is
as it were a portion or cantle of eternity; yet I deny that this is any good
description of time, because every description ought to be per notius, by
something that is more known; whereas eternity is far more obscure than time
it self: all men have a common notion of the one, few or none of the other.
Neither do they give any better satisfaction who define time by duration. For
albeit there is a time of duration of every thing, and a duration also of time
it self, yet duration is not time; duration is the existence of any thing in
time, not the term or time it self. They define time most agreeable to the
Scriptures, who affirm it to be the continual flux of moments, minutes,
hours, days, weeks, months, years, ages, from the creation of the world to
the dissolution thereof, after which the Apoc. 10.6.
Angel swear that time should be no more. But I need to speak no more of time
at this time, because the word in my text is not (...), but (...), time, but
season; or, as it is here rendered,

The accepted time. The season is that in time which light is in the air,
luster in metals, the flower in plants, cream in milk, quintessence in
herbs, the prime and best of it: (...), Now there being a threefold season:

1. Natural, which Husbandmen observe in sowing, Gardeners in planting and
graffing, Mariners in putting to Sea, Chirurgians in letting blood, Physicians
in purging, etc.

2. Civil, of which the Poet speaks, Mollissima fandi tempora, which all
humble suppliants observe in preferring petitions to Princes and great
Personages.

3. Spiritual, which all that have a care of their salvation must observe, in
seeking the Lord while he may be found. The Apostle in this place points to
this third, and his meaning is, Behold, now press hard to get into the
kingdom of heaven, for now the gate is open: now labor hard in Gods vineyard,
for now is the eleventh hour: now put up your petitions to the Prince of
peace, for now is the day of audience: now provide your selves of spiritual
merchandise, for now is the mart: now cast your selves into the Bethesda of
Christ's blood, for now the Angel troubles the water: now get a general pardon
for all your sins, under the broad seal of the King of heaven, for now is a
day of sealing. When the King comes (says St. Chrysostom. in hunc locum. (...).
Chrysostom) there is no time for sessions or assizes, but for pardon and
favor. Behold, now the King is come to visit his subjects upon earth; and from
his first coming to his last the day of grace continues: Behold now is this
accepted time. He calls it an accepted time (says St. Ib. (...).
Chrysostom) because now God accepts them to favor, who a thousand times
incurred his displeasure. It is called in the Hebrew (...) that is, a time of
good will and favor, as Calvin rendereth the words; who bids us mark the
order: first a time of grace is promised, and after a day of salvation, to
intimate unto us, that salvation flows from the mere grace and mercy of God.
We are active in sin to our own damnation, but mere passive to the first
grace: we draw on damnation with the cartropes of vanity, but God draws us to
salvation with the cords of love. The special point of doctrine to which this
ecce or index in my text points is, that we ought to take special notice of
the time of grace, beginning at the birth of our Savior, and ending to us at
the day of our death, and to all men that shall be upon the earth at the
consummation of the world. As the celestial spheres are wrapped one in another,
and the greatest, which the Philosophers term the Primum mobile, invelopeth
all the rest; so the parts of time are enclosed, the lesser in the greater,
hours in days, days in years, years in ages, and ages in the time of the
duration of the world. To explicate then to the full the time of our Lords
birth, it will be requisite to treat 1 Of the age of the world. 2 Of the year
of the age. 3 Of the day of the year in which the true John. 1.9.
light that lighteneth every man that comes into the world first shined on
the earth.


1 Of the age of the world. The Jews, according to an ancient tradition
received from the house of Elias, make three ages of the world, as it were so
many stages of time: 1 From the creation to the law. 2 From the law to the
Messiah. 3 From the coming of the Messiah to the end of the world.
To each of these they allow two thousand years, counting thus, 1 Carrion. in
Chron.
Duo millia vacuum. 2 Duo millia lex. 3 Duo millia Messiah; and post mundi
deflagratio.
Saint. Aug. de civit. Dei. l. 22 c 30. Post hanc tan quam in die septimo requi
escet Deus, cum eundem septimum diem quod nos erimus in seipso faciet
requiescere.
Austine doubleth these files, and makes reckoning of six ages. 1 From Adam
to the Deluge. 2 From the Deluge to Abraham. 3 From Abraham to Solomon. 4 From
Solomon to the captivity. 5 From the captivity to Christ's birth. 6 From Christ's
birth to the day of judgment;
after which, in the seventh, we shall all keep an eternal Sabbath in heaven.
By both which computations it appears that the birth of our Savior fell late
toward the declining and end of time, as Maxin. Taur. hom 6 de nativ. In fine
temporum natus est ille cujus aeternitatem nulla saeculorum tempora
comprehendunt.
Maximus Taurinensis observes. Here the wit of man, which like the Sea will
still be working, though oftentimes foaming out his own shame, curiously
enquireth why the desire and joy of all mankind was so long delayed, why he was
so late born whose birth was of more importance than of all the Potentates,
Princes, Kings, Emperors and Monarchs of the whole world. Was not Christ the
bright morning star? how came it then to pass that he appeared not till the
afternoon, if not evening of the world? Was not he the bridegroom, whose
Marriage song.
Epithalamium Solomon by the spirit of prophecy endited in the book of
Canticles? how could he then hear his dearest Spouse breathe out so many
sighs, and shed such abundance of tears, in so many ages, still longing for
his coming, and crying, Cant. 1.1.
Let him come into the flesh, and kiss me with the kisses of his lips? Was
not he the good Samaritan which healed the wounded man, after Moses the
Levite, and Aaron the Priest passing by left him as they found him, and did him
no ease at all? how then could this tender hearted Chirurgian suffer wounded
mankind to lie so many ages weltring in his own blood, and take no pity on
him? To silence these curious questionists, the most judicious Divines teach,
that albeit God has special reasons of his will for every thing he
determines, yet to us his will must stand for the last and best reason. The
fullest answer that can be given to that demand, why Christ was borne in the
days of the Roman Augustus, about the two and fourtieth year of his reign,
is, that then was the fullness of time, that is, the time was fully come, which
God appointed before all time, for the coming of his Son in the flesh. And
surely a fitter time could hardly have been chosen, whether we respect the
condition of the patient, or the quality of the Physician, or the state of
Judaea, or of the whole world at that time.

First, if we regard the condition of the patient: before Adam fell, and by his
fall took his deaths wound, there was no need of a Chirurgian or a Physician:
and after he was wounded it was fit that he should feel the smart of his
wounds a while, and by woeful experience find that he was not able to help
himself. With this reason Sum. p. 3. q. 1. art. 5. Non decuit a principio
humani generis ante peccatum Deum incarnari: non enim datur medicina nisi
infirmis: nec statim post peccatum conveniens fuit Deumincarnari propter
conditionem primi peccati quod a superbia pervenerat, unde comodo homo erat
liberandus ut recognosceret se indigere liberatore.
Aquinas rested satisfied.

Secondly, if we regard the quality of the Physician. For no man sends for
the greatest Doctor, especially if he be far off, before he has tried
others that are near at hand, or the cure grow dangerous, if not desperate.
Before the King comes himself, many Ambassadors and Noble men are sent.
Nature and Art observe the like method, proceeding from less noble to more
noble works: from the egg to the chicke, from the seed to the fruit, from the
kernel to the apple, from the dawning to the day, from childhood to youth, and
from youth to perfect age. The painter in like manner first makes a rude
draught of a face, after perfectly pourtrayeth it, and last of all casts
beautiful colors upon it: the Chirurgian first washes the wound, then
pours in wine to search it, and after oil to supple and heal it: in like
manner the providence of God proceeded in the dispensing the means of man's
salvation, after the twylight of nature, and dawning as it were of the day, the
day star appeared more obscurely in the publishing of the law, but manifestly
in Saint John Baptists doctrine; and then the Sun arose in the preaching of
the Gospel: first God sent Priests and Prophets as messengers, then Angels and
the Archangell, as it were Princes and Peers of heaven, and last of all he
sent his Son, the heir of all things. Like a Chirurgian he first cleansed
the sores of wounded man by pouring in the wine of the Law, after he suppled
and healed them by pouring in the oil of the Gospel: first he rough hewed us
by Moses, and after plained and smoothed us by Christ, that we might be as the
polished corners of the Temple.

Thirdly, if we regard the state of Judaea, which was now most deplorate, being
destitute both of King and Lawgiver: for Herod a stranger usurped the Crown,
and destroyed the Sanedrim, or great Council, they had now no Prophet or Seer
to lead them in this time of thickest darkness: now therefore, if ever, the
Messiah must come to set all right.

Fourthly, if we regard the state of the whole world, which at this time was
most learned, and thereby most capable of the doctrine of the Gospel. Besides,
it being reduced to a Monarchy, and the parts thereupon holding better
correspondency one with the other, a greater advantage was given for the
dispreading of Christian doctrine through all the Provinces of the Roman Empire.

2 Of the year of the age. As God crowned the age in which our Lord took
flesh, with many remarkable accidents; so also the year of that age.

1 First, Herod this very year bereaving the Tribe of Judah of King and
Lawgiver, utterly abolished their grand Council, and thereby the Prophecy of
Jacob was verified, that Genesis 49.10.
the Scepter should not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his
feet till Shilo come. The substance of the Scepter, if I may so speak, was
departed before, and this year the shadow also remaining hitherto in the
Sanedrim, which had a kind of sovereign power to make laws and execute them,
vanished away: now therefore Shilo comes.

2 Secondly, Moreover, this very year Augustus Caesar Luke 2.1.
sent forth a Decree, that the whole world should be taxed, which was not
without a mystery, viz. that this year the world should be prized, and an
estimate made thereof, when our Lord came into the world to redeem it. Little
thought Augustus (when he gave order for drawing that Proclamation) of drawing
Marie to Bethlehem, that she might there be delivered according to the
prophecy of Micah 5.2.
Micah: yet so did Augustus his temporal Decree make way for Gods eternal
determination of Christ's birth in Bethlehem.

3 Thirdly, this very year the same Emperor shut up the Temple of Functius in
Chron.
Janus, where all the Roman warlike provision lay, and established a peace
through the whole world, that so the Prince of peace might be borne in the
days of peace.

4 Fourthly, this year also he enacted a law Sethus Calvisius ex Dione Cassio.
De manumissione servorum, of setting servants at liberty, which might have
some reference to the spiritual freedom which John 8.36.
Christ purchased for us, whereof he himself says, If the Son make you
free you shall be free indeed.

5 Fifthly, this year in a certain Shop or Inn to be let in Rome, a Plat ex
Eutrop and paulo diac.
fountain of oil sprang out of the earth, and flowed a whole day without
intermission. Magna taberna fuit tunc emeritoria dicta,
De qua fons olei fluxerat in Tiberim.


Which may seem literally to verify those words of the Prophet, Esaias 10.27.
It shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken off thy
shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck; and the yoke shall be destroyed
because of the oil or anointing.

6 Sixthly, what should I speak of the falling down of the Temple of Magdeburg
ex Petro come. Templum pacis corruit Romae ne alibi quam in Messia pax
quaereretur.
peace in Rome about this time? Might not that be an item, that true peace was
no where now to be sought save in Jesus Christ our only Peacemaker, now come
into the world to reconcile Heaven and Earth, and establish a covenant of grace
between God and man for ever?

7 Seventhly, neither is Calvis. in Chron. ad an. c. 1.
Calvisius his hot discordant from our purpose, viz. that the year of our
Lords birth was Annus Sabbathicus, a year made of seven multiplied, or a year
of Jubilee. For even by this very circumstance we may be put in mind that he
who was borne in a temporal Sabbathicke year on earth procures for us an
everlasting Sabbath in heaven.

3 Of the day of the year. From the age in which our Lord was incarnate we
have already proceeded to the year; now from the year we will come to the
day on which God has set many glorious marks.

1 First, St. Matthew tells us of a Mat. 2.2.
new star that appeared to the heathen Sages, which guided them in their way
to Bethlehem.

2 Secondly, St. Quest. vet. and N.T. Hod^e^no die natus est Christus, octavo
Calend. Jan. ab illo die crescunt dies: ecce a nativitate Christi dies crescit,
illo orient dies proficit.
Austine, and St. Ambros. Sermon. 8. de temp.
Ambrose, and Prudent. in hy^n. ad Call. Jan. Quid est quod Arctum circulum Sol
jam recurrens deserit? Christusne terris nascitur qui lucis augit ^ramitem?
Prudemius note that the day of our Lords birth fell precisely upon the winter
solstice, and from that day the days begin to lengthen.

3 Thirdly, this day in the vineyard of Magdeburg. ex Martino. Vinca Engaddi
quae balsamum ferebat, horem, fructum, and liquorem simul fudit.
Engaddi the Balsamum tree both blossomed and bare fruit, and liquor also
dropped from it.

Thus we see what golden characters God has fixed upon the age, year and day
of our Lords birth; in which we may read the benefits of his incarnation, which
are these:

First, rest: this seems to be figured by the Sabbathicke year.

Secondly, peace: this was shadowed by the temporal peace concluded through
all the world by Augustus.

Thirdly, liberty from spiritual thraldom: this was represented by the law
of manumission of servants.

Fourthly, Knowledge: this was showed by the new star.

Fifthly, increase of grace: this was signified by the lengthening of the days
from Christ's birth.

Sixthly, spiritual joy: this was expressed by the oil which sprang out of the
earth.

Seventhly, health and life: this the Balsamum was an emblem of. This peace,
this liberty, this knowledge, this grace, this joy, this health, God offers
to us in this accepted time, and day of salvation.

Behold, now, etc. The Jews had their now, and that was from the day of our
Lords birth to the time of the destruction of the Temple, before which a voice
was heard at midnight, saying, Joseph. de bello Jud. l 7. Migremus hinc.
Let us go hence.

The Gentiles now or day of grace began after Peter's Acts 10.11.
vision, and shall continue until the fullness of all Nations be come in.

Our Countrie's now for their conversion from Paganism began when Joseph of
Arimathea, or Simon Zelotes, or Saint Paul, or some other of the Apostles
planted the Gospel in this Island: for our reversion to the purity of the
ancient doctrine and discipline, was from the happy reformation in King Henry
the eighth his time, and Kings Edward the sixts, and shall last till God for
our sins remove our golden Candlestick.

All your now who hear me this day is from the day of your new birth in
baptism, till the day of your death.

Application.
Behold, now is your accepted time, now is your day of salvation: make good use
of these golden moments, upon which depends your eternal happiness or
misery. Yet by a few sighs you may drive away the fearful storm that
hangs over you; yet with a few tears you may quench the fire of hell in your
consciences; yet by stretching out your arms to God, and laying hold on Christ
by faith, you may be kept from falling into the brimstone lake. While ye have
the light of this day of grace Phil. 2.12.
Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, before the night of death
comes, when John 9.4.
no man can work. If you reject this accepted time, and let slip this day of
salvation, there remains nothing for you but a time of rejection. Mat. 7.23.
Away from me, I know you not: and a day of damnation, Mat. 25.41.
Go ye cursed into everlasting fire.

To apply this now yet once more. Behold now in these feasts of Christmas is
tempus acceptum, an accepted time, or a time of acceptance, a time when we
accept and entertain one another, a time of giving and accepting testimonies
of love, a time of receiving the holy Sacrament, a time when God receives us
into favor, bids us to his own table.

Behold, now is the day of salvation; the day in which our Savior was borne,
and the Titus 2.11.
grace of God, bringing salvation, appeared unto all men. This day our Savior
will come into thy house; and if with humble devotion, godly sorrow, a lively
faith, and sincere love thou entertain him, what himself spoke to Zacheus,
the Spirit will speak unto thee; Luke 19.9.
This day is salvation come to thy house. Which God the Father grant for the
merits of his Son, through the powerful operation of the holy Spirit. To
whom, etc.

THE SPOUSE HER PRECIOUS BORDERS. A rehearsal Sermon, preached Anno 1618. THE
XXXII. SERMON.
CANT. 1.11. We will make thee borders of gold, with studs of silver.


Right Honorable, etc.
AS the riches of Gods goodness are set forth to the eye of the body by the
diversity of creatures in the book of nature; so are the treasures of his
wisdom exposed to the eye of the mind by the variety of senses in the book
of Scripture. Which in this respect is by reverend antiquity compared to the
scrole in Ezekiel. 2.10. Vid. Hier. in c. 2. Ezekielis.
Ezekiels vision, spread before him, which was written Intus and a tergo,
within and without: without in the letter, within in the Spirit; without in the
history, within in the mystery; without in the typical ceremonies, within in
the moral duties; without in the Legal resemblance, within in the
Evangelicall reference; without in verborum foliis, within in radice rationis,
as St. Jerome elegantly expresses it. The former sense resembles the golden
Exodus 16.33. And Moses said to Aaron, take a pot and put an Omer full of Manna
therein, etc.
pot, the latter the hidden Rev. 2.17.
Manna it self: that is as the shell or mother of pearl, this as the
Margarite contained within it; both together, as Nazianz ad Nemes. Literalem
comparat corpori, spiritualem animae; and Verbum Dei geminam habet naturam,
divinam invisibilem, humanam visibilem: ita Verbum Dei scriptum habet sensum
externum and internum.
Nazianzen observes, make this singular correspondency between the incarnate
and the inspired word of God, (both conceived by the holy Ghost, and brought
forth in sacred sheets) that as the one consists of two natures, humane and
divine, visible and invisible; so the other of two senses, external and
internal; external and visible in the shadow or letter, internal and
invisible in the substance or spiritual interpretation: either tropologicall,
or allegorical, or anagogicall, as the learned distinguish. Does Sen. ad
Lucil. ep. 23. Levium metallorum fructus in summo est, illa opulentissima sunt
quorum in alto latet vena assidue before responsura fodienti.
experience teach us that the richest metals lie deepest hid in the earth?
Shall we not think it very agreeable to divine wisdom so to lay up heavenly
knowledge in Scriptures, that the deeper we dig into them by diligent
meditation, the vein of precious truth should prove still the richer? Surely
howsoever some Divines affect an opinion of judgment (it is judgment in
opinion only) by allowing of no sense of Scripture, nor doctrine from thence,
except that which the text it self at the first proposing offers to their
conceit; yet give me leave to tell them that they are but like Apothecaries
boys, which gather broad leaves and white flowers on the top of the water; not
like cunning Diverse, who fetch precious pearls from the bottom of the deep.
St. L. 2. confess. c. 31. Sensit omnino ille, and cogitavit cum ea scriberet
quicquid hic very potuimus invenire, and quicquid nos non potuimus aut nondum
possumus, and tamen in it is inveniri potest.
Austine, the most judicious of all the Fathers, is of a different judgment
from them herein. For he confidently affirms, that the Penman of the holy
Ghost of purpose so set down the words, that they might be capable of
multiplicitie of senses; and that he intended and meant all such divine truths
as we can find in the words, and such also as we have not yet, or cannot
find, and yet by diligent search may be found in them.

Now as the whole texture of Scripture, in regard of the variety of senses, may
not unfitly be likened to the Kings daughters Psalm. 45.14.
raiment of needle-worke, wrought about with diverse colors: so especially this
of the Canticles, wherein the allegorical sense, because principally intended,
may be called literal; and the literal or historical, as intended in the
second place, allegorical. Behold here, as in a fair samplar, an admirable
pattern of drawne-worke, besides King Solomon in his royal robes and his
Queen in a vesture of gold, diverse birds expressed to the life, as the white
Cant. 5.12. ver. 11.^.2.2. ver. 13. c. 4.14. c. 2.1. c. 5.14. c. 1.17. c. 5.15.
c. 1.10.
Dove, washed with milk, and the black Raven: diverse trees, as the thorn,
the fig tree, and the vine, the myrrh, spikenard, saffron, calamus, cinnamon,
with all trees of frankincense: diverse flowers, as the Rose and the Lilly:
diverse precious stones, as the Berill and the Saphir: lastly, diverse
artificial wo^kes, as Houses of Cedar, Rafters of Fur, Tents of Kedar,
Pillars of Marble, set in sockets of fine gold, rows of Jewels, Chains, and
here in my text, Borders of gold, and Studs of silver.

Sanctius and Delrio upon my text observe, that Solomon alludeth to the She
shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
yellow gold.
13. verse of the 68. Psalm; and what the Father prophesied of the Spouse, the
Son promises to her, viz. to make her borders, or, as the Hebrew signifies
also, Brightman in Cant. Turtures aureas, alii murenulas, aliilineas,
septuaginta similitudines.
turtles of gold, enameled with silver. Howbeit it seems more probable that
these words have a reference to the 9. verse of this chapter, and that Solomon
continues his former comparison of a troup of horses in Pharaoh's Chariot:
and thus the borders and chains in the 10th. and 11th. verses are linked to the
9th. O my beloved and beautiful Spouse, as glorious within, through the luster
of divine virtues and graces, as thou art resplendent without in jewels and
precious stones: to what shall I liken thee? or whereunto shall I compare thee?
Thou art like a troop of milk white horses in Pharaoh's princely Chariot,
adorned with rich trappings, and most precious capparisons. For as their head
and cheeks are beset with rows of stones, so thy cheeks are decked with
jewels that hang at thine ears: as their necks shine with golden raines, so
thy neck is compassed with chains of gold and pearl: and as their breasts
are adorned with golden collars, quartered into borders, enamelled with silver,
so that thou must herein also resemble them, we will make thee borders of
gold, with studs of silver, to hang about thy neck, and down thy breast.

Thus much of the letter, or rather letters of my text, which you see are all
golden, flourished over with strikes, or, as Junius translateth the words,
points of silver: now let us endeavor to spell the meaning. As artificial
pictures drawn by the pencill of a skillful Opticke, in the same part of the
frame or table, according to diverse sites and aspects represent diverse things:
(look one way upon them, you shall see a man, another way a lion;) so it is in
this admirable piece drawn by the pencill of Solomon; according to diverse
aspects it presents to our view diverse things: look one way on it and there
appears a man, to wit King Solomon; look another way and there appears a
lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah; look downward upon the history, and you
shall see Solomon with a crown of gold, and his Queen in her wedding garment;
look upward to the allegory, and you shall see Christ crowned with thorns,
and his Spouse the Church in a mourning weed, and under the one written a
joyful Epithalamium, under the other a doleful Elegy. Agreeable to which
double picture drawn with the self same lines and colors, we may consider
the chains and borders of gold in my text, either as habiliments of Solomon's
Queen, or ornaments of Christ's Spouse. If we consider them in the first
sense, they show his royal magnificence and pomp; if in the second, either
they signify the types and figures of the Jewish Synagogue under the law, or
the large territories and rich endowments of the Christian Church under the
Gospel. Faciemus tibi similitudines aur^ cum puncturis argenti.
Origin, who takes the seventy Interpreters for his guide, thus wadeth through
the allegory: The Angels, says he, or Prophets speak here to the Spouse
before her husband Christ Jesus came in the flesh to kiss her with the kisses
of his lips, and their speech is to this effect; O beautiful Spouse, we
cannot make thee golden ornaments, we are not so rich, thy husband when be
comes will bestow such on thee; but in the mean time we will make thee
(...), similitudes of true things; similitudines auri, with studs or points of
silver, id est, scintillis quibusdam spiritualis intelligentiae that is points,
spangles, or sparkles of precious and spiritual meaning. For example: Aarons
mitre and his breast plate of judgment, engraven with Urim and Thummim, and
his golden bells were similitudines auri, similitudes of gold, or golden
similitudes: and the studs or points of silver, that is, sparkles or rays of
spiritual truth in them were Christ his three offices; His Priestly,
represented by the breast plate. His Princely by the mitre. His Prophetical by
the bells.


Again, in the breast plate of Aaron there were set in rows twelve precious
stones; here were similitudes of gold, or golden similitudes; and the studs of
silver, that is, sparkles or rays of spiritual meaning, were the Apoc. 21.14.
twelve Apostles, laid as precious stones in the foundation of the heavenly
Jerusalem, that is, the Church. Take yet a third example: in the Arc there
were the two Heb. 9.4.
Tables, and the golden of Manna, and the rod that had budded; these were
similitudines auri, golden similitudes: and the puncta argenti, that is, the
clear and evident points of spiritual truth in them, are the three notes of
the true Church: 1 The Word, or the Old and New Testament, signified by the two
Tables. 2 The Sacraments, prefigured in the golden pot of Manna. 3
Ecclesiastical discipline, shadowed by Aarons Rod.


Thus I might take off the cover of all the legal types, and show what lies
under them, what liquor the golden vessel contains, what mysteries the
precious robes involve, what sacraments their figures, what ablutions their
washings, what table their Altars, what gifts their oblations, what host their
sacrifices pointed unto. The Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews observes
such an admirable correspondency between these things, that in this respect
the whole Scripture may be likened to one long similitude, the protasis whereof
or first part is in the Old Testament, and the antapodosis or second part in
the New. For in the Old, as the Apostle testifies, there were Heb. 9.23.24.
similitudes of true things; but in the New we find the truth of those
similitudes. Which if our new Sectaries of the precisian or rather Mr.
Whittall, Bradburn, and their followers.
circumcision cut had seriously thought upon, they would not, like Aesops dog,
let fall the substance by catching at the shadow; they would not be so absurd
as to go about to bring the aged Spouse of Christ to her festraw again, and
reduce all of us her children to her Gal. 4.2.3.
nonage under the law: they would not be so mad as to keep new moons, and
Jewish Sabbaths, after the Sun of righteousness is risen so long ago, and
has made us an everlasting Sabbath in heaven. These silly Schismatickes do
but feed upon the scraps of the old Ebionites, of whom Hay. hist. sac. l. 3.
Ebionitae pauperes interpretantur, and vere sensu pauperes ceremonias adhuc
legis custodientes
Haymo out of Eusebius writes thus; (The Ebionites, according to the Hebrew
Etymology of their name, are interpreted poor and silly; and so indeed they
are in understanding, who as yet keep the ceremonies of the old Law.) Nay
rather they lick the Galathians vomit, and therefore I think fit to minister
unto them the purge prescribed by the Gal. 3.1, 2, 3.
Apostle: O foolish Galathians, who has bewitched you, that you should not
obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth,
crucified among you? This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit
by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? Are ye so foolish?
having begun in the Spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Behold I Gal.
5, 2.
Paul testify unto you, that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you
nothing: we may add, If you keep the Jewish Sabbath, or abstain from swines
flesh, out of conscience, and in obedience to the ceremonial Law, Christ's
flesh shall profit you nothing: if you abstain from blood in any such respect,
Christ's blood shall profit you nothing. For I testify again, says St. Paul,
to every man that is circumcised, that he is become a debtor to the whole Law.
And will they not yet learn that Mosaicall rites and ceremonies were at
several times 1. Mortales or moriturae, 2. Mortuae, 3. Mortiferae?
They were mortales at their first constitution, mortuae, that is, dead, at
Christ's death, and now mortiferae, deadly, to all that observe them. Will they
put off the long white robes washed in the blood of the Lamb, and shroud
themselves with the old rags, or, as St. Paul terms them, beggarly rudiments
of the Law? If they are so minded, I leave them, and fill up this Border with
the words of Saint Ser. 7. Antiqua observatio novo tollitur sacramento, hostia
in hostiam transiit, sanguinem sanguis excludit, and legalis festivitas dum
mutatur, impletur.
Leo, The ancient rite is taken away by a new Sacrament, one host passes into
another, blood excludes blood, and the Legal festivity is fulfilled, in that
it is changed.

The second exposition of this Scripture, which understands the golden
borders and silver studs of the glorious and pompous splendor of the Christian
Church, seems to come nearer unto the letter faciemus, we will make thee;
the verb in the future tense evidently implies a promise or prophecy, and
the sense of the whole may be illustrated by this or the like Paraphrase: O
glorious Spouse of Christ, and blessed Mother of us all, who art compassed with
a straight chain about thy neck, that suffers thee not to breathe freely
(being confined to the narrow limits of Judea): in the fullness of time the
fullness of the Gentiles shall come in, and in stead of a straight chain of
gold, or small string of pearl, we will make thee large borders; we will
environ thee with Christian auditories and congregations, as it were borders of
gold, and these borders of gold shall be set out, and supported with studs of
silver, that is, enriched with temporal endowments, and upheld by regal
authority: Esaias 49.23.
King shall be thy nursing fathers, and Queens shall be thy nursing mothers.
Nay, such shall be thy honor and power, that thou shall bind Kings with Psalm.
149.8.
chains, and Nobles with linkes of iron, who for their ransom shall offer
unto thee store of gold to make thee borders, and silver for studs.

Which prophecy seemed to have been fulfilled about the days of Constantine,
or a little after, when such was the sumptuous stateliness of Christian
Churches, and so rich the furniture thereof, that it dazzled the eyes of the
Heathen; Foelix the Emperors Treasurer blessing himself when he beheld the
Church vessels and vestments, saying: En qualibus vasis ministratur Mariae
filio! See what plate the son of Mary is served in! Here I might take
occasion to congratulate our Churches of great Britain, which alone among all
the Reformed, have preserved from sacrilege (ransacking holy things under
pretense of zeal against Idolatry) some remains of Ecclesiastical
preferments and sacred ornaments, as it were borders of gold.

But the time and your expectation call me from the explication of this
Scripture, to make some application thereof to this present exercise. Whereto I
would presently address my self, if I were not arrested by a new action
repetundarum, commenced justly against those, who before me have repeated in
this place. It is alleged against them, that they have turned recensere into
censere, or censuram far, rehearsing into censuring, and contraction of
Sermons into detraction from the Preachers. This is utterly a fault, and I hold
it most necessary at this time and in this place to reprove it, that the
plaster may be applied where the wound has been given. It is no better than in
stead of wine to offer to Christ on this Cross the sharpest vinegar: after
which if any thirst here, I think fit to send him packing on Martial the Poet
his errand; Vaticana bibas si delectaris aceto,
non facit ad stomachum nostra lagena tuum.


Can a fountain out of the same place send forth bitter Jam. 3.11.
waters and sweet? can a man with the same breath bless God and scandalize his
Ministers, glorify him and disgrace their brethren? If any Rehearser hereafter
shall turn Satyrist, and take delight in spilling much wit and reading in this
kind, I desire him seriously to consider, that as Ausonius in epig. Autorem
feriunt tela retorta suum.
Achyllas was hurt in the eye by the rebound of that very stone, which he
inhumanely coited at a skull; so that they cannot cast any contumelious
aspersion in this kind upon their brethren in the Ministry, but that it will
rebound back upon themselves, and wound them in the eye of their discretion,
to say no more. For even they who most applaud their pregnancy, or rather
luxuriancy of wit, secretly condemn their want of judgment, as Tully did his,
who wonderfully pleased himself in that Paronomasie, Videte patres conscripti,
ne circumscripti videamini, whereby he offended all the Senate; Ego vero non
tanti fecissem (...), I would not have set so much by a figure or cadency of
sentence, as for it to fall out with the Council of State. Lib. 6. instit.
Orator. Nimium risus pretium est, si probitatis impendio constat.
Quintilian gravely schools such, telling them, that ^e buyeth a witty conceit
or jest at too dear a rate, who pawneth his honesty for it: Much more he, who
pawneth Christian charity for it. The Ministers of the Gospel, who are styled
Rev. 1.20.
angels in holy Scripture, ought to resemble the Cherubims in the Arc, which
cast a gracious aspect one upon the other; and Rehearsers should be like the
golden snuffers of the Temple, not like extinguishers of baser metal: they
ought to take away the superfluity, and clear the light of their brethrens
labors, not put it out as some have done of late, and left a loathsome savor
behind them: or, to make use of the similitude which I find in my Text, they
should be like studs of silver in borders of gold, receive, and give a mutual
luster one to the other.

Thus having given a law to my self as well as others, I proceed to speak of
the worthy Speakers, whose resounding echo the redoubled command of authority
has made me at this present, who like the Roman Cic. divinat. in Ver.
Quemvis ut mallem eorum qui possunt quam me, me ut mallem quam neminem.
Orator (in his divination in Verrem) had rather that any should have
undertaken this task than my self, my self rather than none.

If (as the Proverb is) tria sunt omnia, so it might be said truly, quatuor
sunt omnia, I should not doubt but to fit the four Speakers, whose
remembrancer I must be, with a similitude running upon four feet. But it is
far otherwise, there are few quaternians in nature, and these have been laid
out for, and anticipated long ago. Besides, as Not. hist. l. 28. c. 8.
Camelion salutaris est parturientibus, si sit domi, si vero inferatur,
pernitiosissimus.
Pliny writes of the flesh of a Camelion, that it is very wholesome for women
in labor, if the Camelion were bred in the country, but very unwholesome if it
be brought from foreign parts; so it may be truly said of allusions and
applications, If they are home borne as it were, and taken from things near at
hand, they are in request; but if they be far fetched they lose their grace.
Howsoever, they who never mean to touch this heavy burden so much as with a
little finger, should forbear to censure those who in these later years are
to furnish this exercise, yea, though we send far for our provision in this
kind; since our just apology may be, that Pliny and Solinus their markets have
bin fore-stalled, and there is nothing to be had near at hand.

The four Posts have long ago rode their four stages.

The four parts of the World have been traversed.

The four rivers of Paradise have been drawn dry.

The four winds have breathed out their last gasp.

The four rich Merchants have sold their commodities.

The four Ambassadors have delivered their embassages.

What shall I add more? Heaven it self has been ransacked, and from thence
four Angels have been called down to sound the four last Trumps: Nay, Hell it
self has been raked for similitudes, and from thence Proteus was conjured up,
to turn himself into four shapes. This (as I conceive) occasioned my
immediate predecessor, with whose praises the Cross yet rings, to chime the
Rehearsers knell with four Bells in this place, where there was never yet any
one hung. Nothing remains for me, who am to fish for allusions after all
these, but to make use of the words of my Text according to the seventies
Translation, faciamus similitudines, to set forth a new Pliny, and forge new
similitudes of things that never were nor will be. But see, as Apelles when he
had often tried to paint the Plin. not. hist. l. 32. Apelles cum spumam pingere
vellet, and saepius frustra expertus esset, iratus arti spongram impegit in
viso loco tabulae, and illa reposuit ablatos colores qualiter cura optabat,
fecitque in pictura fortuna naturam.
foming of a horse, and could never come near it, at last in a rage flung his
sponge carelessly upon his work, and chance expressed that which art could not:
so after much labor taken in devising an emblem, and pourtraying a lively
draught of these four Speakers, at last, unsatisfied with any, I threw down
my pensill upon my work, and behold, quod ars non potuit, casus expressit, I
find here casually in my Text what I so long sought for, similitudines auri,
golden resemblances, to wit, borders of gold with studs of silver. For, as
Sanctius in hunc locum. Aurum, ut ait Aquinas, significat sensum spiritualem,
argentum eloqum nitorem; illud suppedi tat Scriptura, hoc ars concionatoris.
Aquinas teaches us, the gold mystically signifies the Spirits meaning, the
studs of silver the Preachers art; gold represents the precious doctrine they
delivered, silver the perspicuity of their speech, and bright luster of their
style. As for the number, the Text says borders, in the plural number, and if
Solomon continue his former comparison of a troop of horses in Pharaohs
charret (in the precedent Verse) which were four, after the custom of all
Nations when they rode in state, Ergo erit ille dies quo tu pulcherrime rerum
quatuor in niveis aureus ibis equis.
the borders by consequence must needs be four. And herein the mystical
ornaments of the Spouse are corresponding to the typical ornaments of her
Husband. As the Exodus 28.17.
breast of Aaron (a type of Christ) was adorned with four rows of precious
stones; so the neck and breast of Solomon's Queen (the Churches type) is decked
here with four borders of gold.

See then here as it were the model of my intended frame. The friends of the
Spouse who present her with four borders of gold, with studs of silver, are
the four Preachers, whose Sermons may be compared to the borders in my text in
a fourefold respect:

1 Of the number; four Borders, four Sermons.

2 Of the order; the Borders were set immediately one under another, the Sermons
preached one after another.

3 Of the matter; the Borders were made of gold, the Sermons consisted of
Scripture doctrine, like unto Apoc. 3.18.
gold tried in the fire.

4 Of the form; the Borders were enameled with silver, or set out with
spangles of that metal; and in the Sermons Scripture doctrine was beautified
with variety of humane learning, and adorned with short sentences of ancient
Fathers, like O's, spangles, or studs of silver.

Pomiferis ut apes in saltibus omnia libant,
Omnia nos itidem depascimur aurea dicta,
Aurea perpetua semper dignissima vita.
THE FIRST BORDER: OR, THE PASSION SERMON.
The first presented the Spouse with a Border of gold, with Studs of silver,
wrought upon the text, Zech. 13.7. Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and
against the man that is my fellow, says the Lord of hosts: smite the
shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. And thus he put it on:

ILlius Doctoris libentius audio vocem (says devout Bernard) non qui sibi
plausum, sed qui mihi planctum movet. The first Sermon preached on good Friday
by master Warberton now Dean of Wels, abridged.
Me thinks whilst you are here assembled to celebrate the memory of our
Lords death, I see a great concourse as it were to a funeral Sermon; I shall
therefore entreat you, Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc. to prepare
rather your hearts to be wounded, than your ears to be tickled; and at this
time to lay aside all expectation either of Art or Learning, and yield your
selves wholly to religious Passion.

It is the observation of St. Austine and Gregory, that the four beasts
mentioned by St. John, mystically represent the four maine acts of Christ,
Apoc. 4.7.
or works of man's redemption.

His 1 Incarnation. 2 Passion. 3 Resurrection. 4 Ascension.
For at his Incarnation he took our nature upon him, and was found in shape as
a Man: In his passion as a Bullock he was slain for sacrifice: In his
resurrection he was a Lion: In his ascension as an Eagle. We here consider him
as a Bullock sacrified upon the altar of the Cross. Which as it is the
greatest mystery that ever was revealed to the world: so the Penmen of the
holy Ghost have bin most laboriously employed to publish it in all ages;
figuring it in the Law, foretelling it in the Prophesies of the Old Testament,
and representing it most lively in the history of the Gospel. I have to do
with a Prophecy somewhat dark before the light of the Gospel shone upon it:
Awake, O sword, etc. which words in the Prophet are a Prosopopaeia made by God,
or an Apostrophe to his sword to whet it self, and be stirred up against a man
of mean condition in the estimate of the world, A shepherd: yet in some
relation to himself, my shepherd: of a strange composition and quality, a man
that is my fellow: and it extends to the smiting of this shepherd, and
scattering his whole flock. The parts are two, 1 The Speaker, the Lord of
hosts. 2 The speech. Wherein observe, 1 Direction; O sword. 2 Matter. Wherein,
1 Incitation. Wherein, 1 The act, Awake. 2 The object; described by 1 His
office; shepherd. 2 Person; which is my fellow.

2 Commission. Wherein, 1 The act; smite. 2 The effect; the sheep shall be
scattered.



First we are to speak of the Speaker, the Lord of hosts.

The Lord of hosts is a name of power, and sounds like a thunder; his
General is Death, his great Captains Plague, Famine, and the Sword, his
Arsenall the whole world, and all creatures in heaven, earth and hell his
Soldiers, ever ready pressed to fight his battles. Quantus Deus Dominus
exercituum (says St. Bernard) cui inservit universa creatura? Only rebellious
man stands out in such defiance to his Maker, that the creatures which were
ordained to be under his dominion, are often awaked, and summoned to be armed
for his destruction.

Awake, O sword. As all the creatures are Gods soldiers, so when he imployeth
them against man they are called his swords. The wicked is said to be his Psalm.
17.13.
sword, and the 1 Chronicles. 21.27.
pestilence also. When the Lord is pleased to execute his wrath, he never
wants instruments or means: he has a sword for Saul, and an oak for
Absalom, and a roape for Achitophel, and a gibbet for Haman, and a worm for
Herod: and thus for the general.

The particular intent of the Spirit leads me to another consideration, viz.
that of this great blow here threatened to the shepherd, God himself is the
Author: Deus erat qui pastorem percuti jubebat (says Maldonat) and quod per
alium facit ipse facit. Yea, but God never awaketh his sword to smite but for
sin, and in this shepherd there was no sin of his own, the sword
therefore lies sleeping in the scabbard, and must now be summoned to awake.

Awake, O sword; Chereb gnuri. To the act of mercy we are all apt to importune
God with clamours, Up Lord: but to the act of justice if we should provoke him,
who were able to stand before him? To this he is enforced, after a sort; to
provoke himself. Wherein observe, first his unwillingnesse to strike, till he
is provoked his sword sleeps: secondly his have and resolution to strike when
he is provoked, in that he will awake his sword.

He who is here styled Lord of hosts, is elsewhere named the Father of mercy;
and by his attributes set down in Exodus 34. ver. 6, 7. it appears that he is
nine to two more inclineable to mercy than to justice. But because from this
hope of mercy many are apt to promise themselves impunity, putting ever from
them the evil day, I hold it more needful at this present to show his haste
and readiness to execute vengeance upon such who presume too far upon his
long suffering and goodness. There is a generation of men described by David
in the 10. Psalm, ver. 11. that say in their heart, God has forgotten: he
hides his face, he will never see it. And by Solomon, Eccles. 8.11.
Because sentence against their evil works is not executed speedily,
therefore their heart is fully set in them to do evil. Ut sit magna tamen
certe lenta ira deorum est.

To these St. Peter has answered long ago, 2 Pet. 3.9.
The Lord is not slack (as some men count slacknesse) but is long suffering to
usward, (that is, the Elect) whose conversion he graciously expects. When
their number is accomplished, and the sins of the Reprobate which now look
white shall turn yellow and grow full ripe, he will awake his sword to wound
the heads of his enemies, and his stay in the mean time is but to fetch his
arm the further back, that be may give the sorer stroke; and to draw his
arrow to the head, that he may wound the deeper. For this cause the ancient
heathen attributed to God leaden feet, but iron hands; quia tarditatem
vindictae gravitate compensat. Tacit. annal. l. 1. In Haterium statim invectus
est, at Scaurum, cui implacabiltus irascebatur, silentio transmisit.
Tacitus notes it of Tiberius Caesar, that being displeased with Q. Haterius
and Scaurus, but not equally, he fell foul presently upon Haterius, with whom
he was less angry, but said not a word to Scaurus for the present, against
whom he conceived irreconcilable haired: so God when he is a little offended
at some slips of the godly, he awaketh his sword presently, but lays it down
again after he has smote gently with it; Bernard. in Cant. Ser. 42.
Hic punit ut illic pareat, and supra omnem miserationem est ira ista: but to
the wicked he gives line enough, that they may play with the hook, and
swallow it deep down with the bait; Hic punit ut illic seviat, and supra
omnem iram est miseratio ista. But praised be the Lord of hosts, who to
ransom us has found a man to wreake his wrath, and turn his sword upon, his
shepherd. It is noted of Xiphilin. in vit. Trajan.
Trajane, that he would cut his richest robes in pieces to make rags for his
soldiers wounds: I shall now propose unto you a man, that to bind up your
bleeding wounds, has suffered himself to be cut in pieces under the fury of
this waking sword. Awake, O sword

Against my shepherd. O magne Pastor animarum (says Bonaventure) pasce animam
meam, and ut pascatur melius fac ut ipse pascam. Christ is a mighty shepherd,
but yet of a little flock, which was first pent within the walls of Eden, and
thence turned out, wandered on the earth till the flood, at the deluge took
ship and landed in Armenia, from thence removed to Canaan, and from Cannaan to
Egypt, and from Egypt back again toward Canaan, and after four hundred
years straggling in a strange land, wandered forty years in the wilderness,
and at last was folded in Judaea. In all which crossings, and turnings, and
wanderings, he never ceased to feed and fodder them: to give us his substitutes,
as well an example by his practice, as a rule by his precept, to feed, feed,
and feed. Alimento, verbo, exemplo: quid est amas me? Nisi quaeris in Ecclesia
non tua sed mea, (says St. Austine) nisi testimonium perhibeat conscientia
quod plus me ames quam tua, quam tuos, quam te, nequicquam suscipias curam
hanc. But if thy conscience assure thee that thou love Christ in such sort,
then feed thou his flock as well with integrity of life, as purity of
doctrine; learn as well facere dicenda, as dicere facienda; that is, as Saint
Jerome aptly expresses it, verba vertere in opera. Thou must have engraven on
thy breast as well Thummim as Urim, and there must hang as well Pomegranates
about thy garment as golden bells.

The Popish Writers say that a shepherd should have three things, a scrip, a
hook, and a whistle; but for their own parts they are so greedy on the scrip,
and busy with the hook, that they forget the whistle, give over their study
and preaching: ac si tum victuri essent sine cura cum pervenirent ad curam;
making account that all their care is past when they are got into a cure. But
the shepherd we speak of was the good shepherd who fed his flock day and
night, and laid down his life for it: he is the universal shepherd; and ita
curat omnes oves ut singulas. He is here called Gods shepherd, because his
dispensation is from him, or because he is the beloved of God, and that divine
shepherd which Com. in Evan.
Ardeus thus excellently describes, Educens e lacu miseriae, conducens per
viam gratiae, perducens ad pascua gloriae: and shall the sword of the Lord be
against this shepherd? The case is different between him and David; there it
was quid meruerunt oves? here it is quid meruit Pastor? For he was candidus and
rubicundus, candidus innocentia and rubicundus passione; sine macula criminis,
and sine ruga erroris. Had the sword been awaked against the wolf it had
been mercy, against the sheep is had been justice; but to awake against this
good shepherd seems to be hard measure. The case is resolved by Daniel: The
Messiah shall be slain, but not for himself, God has laid upon him the
iniquity of us all. O ineffabilis mysterii dispositio! peccat impius, and
patitur justus: meretur malus, patitur bonus: quod committit homo sustinet
Deus. Here then you see the first and maine cause of the shepherds slaughter,
your sins. It is in vain to shift it off on Judas or Pilat, and most impious
to lay it upon the Lord of hosts. For solum peccatum homicida est: so that I
may bring it home to the bosom of every one of you in the words of Nathan, Tu
es homo, Thou art the man that have slain this shepherd. O consider this, ye
that forget God; do not so wickedly as to commit a second murder upon this
good shepherd, crucify not again the Lord of life: every reviling speech to
your neighbor is a whip on his side, every traducing of your superiors a
crown of thorns to his head, every neglect of charity to his members new
nails to wound his hands and feet, every blasphemous word a new spitting on
his face, every oath a spear to pierce his heart. But what moved him to become
our surety and sacrifice? No reason can be given but his will, Oblatus est quia
voluit, He was offered because he would, he would because he loved us: and
to the end he might the better undergo his office, because it became us to
have such an high Priest that had feeling of our wants and infirmities, he
became man.

The man. The Hebrews have four several words for a man, Adam, Enosh, Ish,
Geber; Adam signifying red earth, Enosh, a man of sorrow, Ish, a man of a noble
spirit, Geber, a strong man; we have found a man here in all these senses.
Adam, earth as we; Enosh, a man of sorrows; Ish, a man of a noble spirit, to
encounter all the powers of darkness; Geber, a strong man, stronger than he
in the Mat. 12.29.
Gospel, which first possessed the house. Behold the man, says Pilat: but a
man of sorrow, says Esaias: nay, a worm and no man, says David: nay less
resisting than a worm; for a worm if it be trod upon will turn again: but
this man went like a lamb to the slaughter: or, if he may rightly be termed a
worm, certainly a silke-worme, spinning us a precious web of righteousness
out of his own bowels: yet this worm and no man is Ish, one of noble spirit;
and Geber, a valiant man: yea, such an one as is Gods fellow.

My fellow. For in him the Godhead dwells bodily, and in him all the Saints
are complete: he is the brightness of his Fathers glory, and the engraven
form of his person. -- ipse paterni
Pectoris effigies, lumenque a lumine vero.


Semper cum patre, semper de patre, semper in patre, semper apud patrem, semper
quod pater, says Fulgentius: ex ipso, cum ipso, hoc quod ipse, says Saint
Austine: who being in the form of God thought it not Phil. 2.6.
robbery to be equal with God; and therefore God calls him here his
fellow. Such a one i^ became him to be, that was to encounter principalities,
to come upon the strong man (whereby is meant the Devil) and bind him, and
spoil his goods; to grapple with the great King of fear, Death; to say to
hell and the grave, Effata; to swallow up the swallower of all things, to
destroy destruction, and to lead captivity captive, and to return with glory
from thence unde negant quenquam redire.

Again, my fellow, yet a man; creator matris, creatus ex matre, says Saint
Austine: ipsum sanguinem quem pro matre obtulit, ante de sanguine matris
accepit, says Emissenus. He that was the brightness of his Father, and such
a brightness as no man could behold and live, has now a traverse drawn over
his glory: the word is made flesh, seposita non deposita majestate, says
Emissenus: naturam suscipiendo nostram, non amittendo suam, says Saint
Austine: ad terrena descendit, and coelestia non deseruit, hic affuit, and inde
non defuit: and so be became Emmanuel, God with us, perfect God, and perfect
man: man to receive supplications from man, God to deliver them to God: man to
suffer for man, God to satisfy God. Apparuit medius (says Saint Austine)
inter mortales peccatores, and immortalem justum mortalis justus; mortalis cum
hominibus, justus cum Deo: ne vel in utroque similis long esset a Deo, aut in
utroque dissimilis long esset ab hominibus. To conclude this point, Gods
fellow to offer an infinite sacrifice for all mankind, and a man that he might
be himself the sacrifice killed by the sword which is now awaked to smite him.

1 Smite the Shepherd. Hachharogneh, hacke him, hew him, butcher him. Now are
the reins let loose to all the powers of darkness, now is the sword flying
about the Shepherds ears, now have they power to hurrie him from Annas to
Caiaphas, from Caiaphas to Pilat, from Pilat to Herod, from Herod again to
Pilat, and so to Calvarie; and in every passage appears a sword that might
cleave asunder a heart of Adamant: yet the Lord of hosts says still

2 Smite him. Now has Judas power to betray him, the Priests to convent him,
the standers by to buffet him, the officers to whip him, the people to deride
him, Pilat to condemn him; and in every act appears a sword that might cleave
in sunder a heart of rock: yet the Lord of hosts says still

3 Smite him. Now the thorns have power to goare him, the whip to lash him,
the nails to fasten him, the spear to pierce him, the Cross to extend him,
the grave to swallow him; and in every one appears a sword that might cleave
in sunder a heart of steel: yet the Lord of hosts says still

4 Smite him. Let no part be free from torment; not his head from pricking,
nor his face from spitting, nor his flesh from whipping, nor his pallat from
vinegar, nor his hands and feet from piercing, nor his heart from the spear:
yet still the Lord of hosts says

5 Smite him. The torment of his body was but the body of his torment, the
soul of his torment was his souls torment. Now his soul is troubled, says
John; nay, exceeding sorrowful, says Mark; nay, heavy unto death, says
Matthew: all the streams of blood that issued from him on the Cross were
nothing to his drops in the garden: those were forced with outward violence,
these were drained out with inward sorrow. Sure (says one) he was near some
furnace that melted him. Here was a blow that if he had not been Gods fellow
would have struck him down to hell: yet the Lord of hosts says

6 Smite him. The sense of pain is not so grievous as the want of comfort.
Here all comfort is withheld; the people deride him, and prefer a murderer
before him: of his own people and servants, one betrayeth him, another denies
him, all forsake him: all this is nothing in comparison. For friends are but
earthly comforts, but that his Father from heaven should forsake him, here is
the sword that cleaves his heart, and makes up the full measure of the blow.

In the very heat of his passion he took no notice of any other torment but
this only, that his God had forsaken him. It is wonderful that never any
Martyr brake forth into the like speech, notwithstanding all their exquisite
torments: but the reason is assigned by St. Austine, Martyrs non eripuit,
nunquid deseruit?

By this time I know you expect the fullness of the blow; vox faucibus haeret,
it is death, the ignominious death of the Cross. Vexed he was before his
death, tortured in his death, wounded after his death; hic salus patitur,
fortitudo infirmatur, vita moritur. Now the Angels stand amazed at the blow,
the earth trembles, the stones are cleft, and the veil of the Temple rends,
and the people smite their breasts: now are blackes hung all about the
galleries of heaven; the Sun has put on a dark veil, insomuch that a
Philosopher, as far from his hearse as from his faith, takes notice of this
great Gods funeral. And to make up the company of true mourners, the grave
sends forth her dead, and corpse arise and enter into the holy City: now is
his hearse set without the gate, that they that are without, even dogs, may see
him, and make songs of him; and lest any should be ignorant whose hearse it
was, his title is set up in Hebrew, Greek and Latin. O tell it not in Gath,
publish it not in Askelon, lest the uncircumcised rejoice to see the glory of
Israel obscured: nunc, nunc vires exprime dolor, solitum flendi vincito morem.
If it be true, that the Hebrews have no word for eyes but what serves for
springs, it seems that all the eyes the holy Language speaks of, should be
like springs, wherewith they should bewail him whom they have pierced: yet
there is better use of this than to lament. O consider this and rejoice; weep
for him, but rejoice for your selves. When the glittering sword in the hand of
the Lord was lift up, and his arm stretched out utterly to destroy you, this
Shepherd steppeth in, and stands between, and in his own body receives
the blow that was aimed at you. O consider you this, for whom the Shepherd
has suffered such things. First, acknowledge with reverence the singular
justice of God, that could not be satisfied but with such a ransom. Secondly,
acknowledge with detestation the hideousness of your sins, that deserved so
great a ransom. Thirdly, acknowledge the uneffable love of this blessed
shepherd that paid this great ransom.

On the other side, consider this and tremble, ye that forget God; ye have no
interest in this Shepherds death: look to your selves in time, antequam exeat
ira apprehendite disciplinam, osculamini filium. The Shepherd is smiten, if
you look to it in time it may be for you; if not, a worse disaster remains
for you than befell these sheep: you shall be confounded, they were but
scattered.

The sheep shall be scattered. This Prophecy has special relation to their
temporal flight, but it extends also to their amazement and staggering at
the heaviness of the blow. They trusted that it had been he that should have
redeemed Israel; but now through his blow they are fallen from their trust.

The Sun labors in the eclipse, no ray appears, he cannot be discerned to
be the Son of God, all candles were quite blown out this night, unless it
were, as Allensis affirms, that of Virgin wax; and whether it had any light
in it I cannot say, certainly the sword went through her heart too. But
disperguntur tantum, non destruuntur oves, these sheep shortly met again, and
suffered much with great constancy for their shepherd. Peter and Andrew were
crucified, James beheaded, the other James brained with a Fullers club, all
martyred save John; yet in all these deaths they were more than conquerours:
sanguis Martyrum semen Evangelii, the blood they spilt was as oil to feed the
lamps of the Church, or as dew to fatten her soil. Let no man therefore be
deterred at the mention of the Cross; it is like the man in armor that
appeared to Josuah, who seemed dreadful at the first, but in the end proved a
friend. O bone Jesu, ubicunque fueris, in praesepi, in horto, in cruce, in
sepulchro, non curo, modo te inveniam; O sweet Jesu, wheresoever thou art, in
the manger, in the garden, in the cross, in the sepulcher, I care not what
befalls me, so I may find thee.

Thus have I presented unto you the gift which the first Speaker tendered to
the Spouse of Christ, a border of gold, with studs of silver: nothing remains
but that I work an emblem of the giver in his gift. Every emblem consists
of an image and a motto; the Image shall be Sulpitius, the motto Tullies
testimony of him in his book De claris oratoribus. Maxim grandis, and, ut it
a dicam, tragicus Orator; incitata and volubilis, nec redundans tamen oration;
vox magna and suavis, gestus venustus; he was a lofty, and, if I may so
speak, a tragical Orator; his speech was full and fluent, yet not redundant;
his voice great and sweet, his gesture comely.

THE SECOND BORDER: OR, THE RIGHTEOUS MAMMON.
The second border of gold, which the second Speaker offered to the Spouse, was
wrought upon that text of Scripture, which we find, 1 Timothy 6.17. Charge them
that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in
uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to
enjoy.

Ver. 18. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
distribute, The second Sermon, preached by Doctor Hall, now Lord Bishop of
Exon, abridged.
willing to communicate. And thus he put it on.

Right Honorable, Right Reverend, etc.
THose things which are most necessary in their use, are most dangerous in
their miscarriage. And therefore nothing is more necessary for a Christian,
than to be rectified in the managing of a prosperous estate, and to learn so
to manage his happiness here, that he may be happier hereafter: which this
text undertakes to teach, where Timothy is set as it were upon the Bench to
give the charge: Charge. A charge, to whom? To the rich. Of what? 1 What they
must avoid: 1 High-mindednesse; because their wealth is in this world. 2 Trust
in wealth; because their riches are uncertain.
2 What they must endeavor and labor for: 1 Confidence in God; because he is
a living and liberal God. 2 Beneficence to men; because by this they lay up to
themselves a sure foundation.



Here, said the Preacher, is work enough for my discourse and your practice: I
fear more than enough for my rehearsing. The God of heaven, who blessed it in
his hands, bless it now in mine, who have it but at the second hand.

Charge. Charge, Janus-like, has a double aspect; the one that looks up to
Saint Paul, the other that looks down to Timothy, and from him to the rich.
In the first there is Apostolical superiority, in the second Episcopal
power, and Evangelicall sufficiency. For the first, charge thou, referres to,
I charge thee, ver. 13. so Paul charge Timothy to charge the rich. The first
foundation of the Church was laid in an inequality, and has ever since so
continued. There can be no harmony where all the strings and voices are of one
tenor: he that gives the charge, if he be not the chief of the Bench, yet
he is greater than the Jurie: the rich are commonly great: Nobility in the
account of God is joined with wealth. Curse not the King in thy thought, nor
the rich in thy bed chamber, says Solomon. So Dives, at whose gates Lazarus
lay, is by some (no mean ones) ghessed to be Herod, or some other King; and so
are Jobs friends termed by the Seventie. Yea, the rich is not only a little
King among his neighbors; but dives, quasi divus, as a petty god to his
underlings: yet Timothy has authority to charge and command such rich. That
foolish shaveling soared too high a pitch, when in his imperious Bull he
commanded the Angels: but we may safely say all powers below the Angels are
liable to our spiritual charge, and the power of the keys which Christ has
given us. But what now becomes of them? that I may not say in some of our
hands they are suffered to rust for want of use, in others, as the
Pontificians, the wards are altered, so as they can neither open nor shut: Sure
I am the power of them is lost in the hearts of many, they have secret
pickelockes of their own making, presumption and security; whereby they can
open heaven gates, though double locked by our censures, and shut the gates of
hell at pleasure, which their own sins have opened wide to receive them.
What use then is there of us but in our chair? and there but to be heard and
seen? Even in this sense spectaculo facti sumus, we are to gaze on, and not to
implie. Yet it was well noted by one, that the good father of the Prodigal,
though he might himself have brought forth the prime robe, or have led his
son into the wardrobe to take it, yet he commands his servants to bring it
forth, because he would have his son to be beholden to his servants for his
glory. He that can save you without us, will not save you but by us.

Hitherto the power employed in the charge: the sufficiency follows. This
Evangelicus must be Parangelicus: Like as the forerunner of Christ had a charge
for all sorts, so has Timothy in this epistle a charge for wives, for
husbands, for Bishops, for Deacons, for Widows, for Servants, and here for the
rich. And I am persuaded that no Nation under heaven ever had more sufficient
Timothies, to instruct all sorts of men in the ways of salvation, than this
our Land: so that what Jerome spoke sometime of Britain, is now most true,
comparing it with Jerusalem as it had been; De Hierosolymis and de Britannia
equaliter patet aula coelestis. For the Northren parts, since his sacred
Majesty in his last journey (as if the Sun did out of compassion go beyond his
tropicke line to give heat to that climate) visited them, are better provided
of Preachers, and maintenance for Preachers, and both Pastors and people
profess themselves mutually blessed in each other, and bless God and their
King for their blessedness. And as for the Southern, when I behold them me
thinks I see the Firmament in a clear night bespangled with goodly Stars of
all magnitudes, that yield a pleasant diversity of light unto the earth; but
above all, this City is rich in this spiritual provision. Other Cities may
exceed you in the glory of outward structure, in the largeness of extent, in
the uniforme proportion of streets, or ornaments of Temples: but your pulpits
are past theirs; and if preaching can lift up Citizens to heaven, ye are not
upon earth. Hear this, O ye Citizens, and be not proud, but thankful unto
God.

I add also to your Preachers, no vice more hateful to God and man than
ingratitude, no ingratitude more abominable than to parents, no parents ought
to be dearer unto you than those who have begot you through the Gospel in
Christ.

Charge them: But whom? The rich.

The rich. Who are rich? According to Morality and Christianity, they that
have enough with content: so says the Apostle, Godliness is great gain, if a
man be content with that which he has. St. Jerome says, victus and vestitus
divitiae Christianorum. According to the vulgar use of the word, they are rich
who have more than is necessary. Now there is a double necessity, of nature,
of estate: that is necessary to nature, without which we cannot live; that is
necessary to estate which is superfluous to nature, and that which were
superfluous to nature, is not so much as necessary to estate: nature goes
single, and bears little breadth; estate goes ever with a train: the
necessity of nature admits little difference, especially for quantity; the
necessity of estate requires as many diversities, as there are several degrees
of humane conditions, and several circumstances in those degrees. Thus
understanding what is meant by the word, come we now to the matter. Man that
came naked out of the womb of the earth, was even then so rich, that all things
were his: heaven was his roof, or canopie, the earth his floor, the Sea his
pond, the Sun and Moon his torches, all creatures his vassals: and if he
lost the fullness of this Lordship by being a slave to sin, yet we have still
dominium gratificum, as Gerson terms it. In this sense every son of Abraham
is heir of the world: but to make up the true reputation of wealth (for thus
we may be, as having all things and possessing nothing) another right is
required besides spiritual, which is a civil and humane right: wherein I
doubt not but our learned Wickliffe, and Armacanus, and Gerson, have had much
wrong, whilst they are accused to teach that men in these earthly things have
no tenure but grace, no title but charity; which questionless they intended
in foro interiori, in the consistory of God, not in the common pleas of men;
in the court of conscience, not in the courts of Law. For it is certain that
besides this spiritual right there is a civil right in earthly things: and
the Scripture speaking secundum jus gentium, whereon the division of these
earthly possessions is grounded, calls some poor, some rich. The Apostle
says not, charge men that they be not rich, but, charge the rich that they be
not high minded. The rich. In this one word, and as it were with one graspe,
the Apostle crusheth the heads of two heresies, the ancient Apostolici, who
denied the lawfulness of earthly proprieties; and our late Popish votaries,
who place holiness in want and poverty. Did these men never hear that the
blessing of God makes rich? that the wise man's wealth is his strong City? If
Lazarus was poor, yet Abraham was rich: and pium pauperem suscepit sinus
divitis, in divitiis cupiditatem reprehendit, non facultatem, says Austine.
Bona est substantia si non sit peccatum in conscientia, substance does well in
the hand, if there be no evil in the heart. Let the rich take heed how he
became so: Ecclus. 13.25.
that God which can allow you to be rich, will not allow you all ways to your
wealth: he has set up a golden goal to which he allows you all to run,
but you must keep the beaten rode of honesty, justice, charity and truth. If
you will leave this path, and by crossing over a shorter cut through by-ways
of your own, you may be rich with a vengeance. The heathen Poet Menander could
observe (...), which Solomon may seem to translate, saying, Pro. 28.22.
He that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent. It were envious and
infinite to arraigne all sorts of fraud, usurie, and extortion, whereby many
become oversoone rich: let me shut up all together in that fearful sentence
of Solomon, The gathering of treasures by a deceitful tongue is a vanity,
Pro. 21.6.
tossed to and fro of them that seek death; and the robbery of the wicked
shall destroy them. Search your chests, search your hearts, all ye that hear
me this day; and if any of you find any of this adulterine gold among your
heaps, away with it, as you love your selves away with it; else know that (as
Chrysostom says wittily) ye have locked up a thief in your counting house,
which will carry away all; and, if you look not to it the sooner, your soul
with it. Have a care of this ye that are rich

In the world. As Saint John distinguishes between being in the Church, and
of the Church, so St. Paul of rich in the world, and of the world. Those are
the rich of the world which are worldlings in heart as well as in estate; those
are rich in the world whose estate is below, though their hearts may be above:
the rich of the world are in it, but the rich in the world are not necessarily
of it. If Timothy or St. Paul should have charged the rich of the world, he
had charmed a deaf adder; yea perhaps, even with this charge, like a rusty or
ill wrought piece, they had recoyled in his face with those Athenians, What
will this babbler say? To the other sort therefore, whose hearts are not in
their bags, Timothies charge and my speech is directed. Let these hear, first,
their condition; secondly, their duty: their condition, they are rich; but in
this world. This clause serves,

1 For distinction. As St. Austine distinguishes of pauper in animo, and
pauper in sacculo, so may we of spiritual wealth, and secular, and worldly.
This latter is valued by pieces of earth, and one mouthfull of earth makes an
end of all: that which the worldly man dotes and dreams of is but even
Nebuchadnezzars Image, a composition of metal, and the foot of all is clay.
Earthly men tread upon their felicity, and yet have not the wit to contemn
it, and to seek a better, which is the spiritual wealth; the cabbinet whereof
is the soul, and the treasure in it God himself. O happy resolution of that
blessed Father, Omnis mihi copia quae Deus meus non est, egestas est.

2 This serves for limitation. (...) as it is absolutely taken, quasi (...),
signifies eternity, but restrained with a (...) it is scarce a time; yet this
is the utmost extent of worldly wealth, the short space of humane life. All our
crowns, and soveraines, and pieces, and half pieces, and ducats, and double
ducats are current but to the brimme of the grave, there they cease: and we
justly laugh at the folly of those eastern Pagans, who put coin into a dead
man's hand for his provision in another world. What should we do therefore, if
we will be provident Travelers, but make over our money here, to receive it by
exchange in the world to come? It is our Saviors counsel, Make you friends of
unrighteous mammon, etc. And as an ancient Father says sweetly, If you will be
wise Merchants, thriftie and happy Usurers, part with that which you cannot
keep, that you may gain that which you cannot lose. Which that you may do,
hearken to the duties which God lays upon you: the first whereof is the
remover of evil;

That you be not high minded. It is strange to see how this earthly dross,
which is of it self heavy, and therefore naturally sinkes downward, should
raise up the heart of man; yet it commonly carries a man up even to a double
pitch of pride, one above others, the other above himself: above others in
contempt, above himself in overweening. The man with a gold ring (in Saint
James) looks to sit highest. And not to cast back your eyes, do we not see
it thus in our times? If a man be but worth a footecloth, how big he looks
on the inferior passengers? and if he has purchased a little more land and
title, you shall see it in his garb: whatsover he does he is not as he was,
nor as the Pharisee says, like other men: he looks upon vulgar men as if
they were made to serve him, and should think themselves happy to be
commanded by him: and if he be crossed a little he swells like the Sea in a
storm. Neither does this pride raise a man more above others than above
himself; and what wonder if he will not know his poor neighbors, who has
forgot himself? As Saul was changed into another man presently upon his
annoynting; so is it with them upon their advancement, now it may not be taken
as it has been. Other carriage, other fashions are fitter for them, their
attire, fare, retinue, houses, furniture displease them, new must be had,
together with coaches and lackies, and all the equipage of greatness. These
things I dislike not simply, they are fit for those that are fit for them:
charity is not strait-laced, but yields much latitude to the lawful use of
things indifferent: but it is the heart that makes all these things evil, when
it is puffed up with these windy vanities, and has learned to borrow that
part of the Devils speech, All these things are mine: and can say with him that
was turned into a beast, Is not this great Babel which I have built? If there
be here any of these empty bladders that are puffed up with the wind of
conceit, give me leave to prick them a little. And

First, let me tell them that they may have much, and be never the better. The
chimney overlookes all the rest of the house; is it not for all that the very
basest piece of the building? The heathen man could observe, that God gives
many a man wealth for the greater mischief; as the Israelites were rich in
Quails, but their sauce was such, that famine had been better. Haman was
proud that he alone was called to the honor of Queen Hesters feast, this
advancement raised him fifty cubits higher to a stately gibbet. If your wealth
be to any of you an occasion of falling, if your gold be turned into fetters,
it had been better for you to have lived beggars.

Secondly, let me tell them that they are proud of that which is none of
theirs. For Philo's observation is most true, That God only by a propriety is
styled the possessour of heaven and earth by Melchizedech in his speech to
Abraham: we are only tenants, and that at the will of the Lord. We have but
jus ad rem, not dominion in rem; a right only of favor from the proprietarie
and Lord in heaven, and that liable to account. Do we not laugh at the Groom
that is proud of his masters horse? Or some vain Whifler that is proud of a
borrowed chain? So ridiculous are we to be puffed up with that whereof we must
needs say with the poor man of the hatchet, Alas master it is but borrowed.
Therefore if God have laden any of you with these earthly riches, be you like
unto the full ear of corn, hang down your heads in true humility toward
the earth, from which we came.

Hitherto of the high-mindednesse that follows wealth: now where our pride is,
there will be our confidence; which is forbidden in the next place.

And trust not in uncertain riches. To trust in riches is to set our heart on
them, to place our joy and contentment in them; in a word, to make them our
best friend, our patron, our idol, our God. This the true and jealous God will
not abide, and yet nothing is more ordinary. The rich man's wealth is his
strong City, says Solomon: and where should a man think himself safe but in
his fort? Silver answers to all, says Solomon; that we grant, although we
would be loath it should answer to truth, to justice, to judgment: but yet
mammon vants to conquer all, according to the old Greek verse, fight with
silverlances, and you cannot fail of victory: to pacify all, (...).
(for a gift in the bosom appeases wrath) to procure all secular offices,
titles and dignities, I would I might not say claves altaria Christum. And let
me tell you indeed what mammon can do; He can unbarre the gates of hell to the
unconscionable soul, and help his followers to damnation: this he can do:
but for other things, howsoever with us men the foolish silver-smithes may
shout out, Great is mammon of the worldlings; yet if we weigh his power
aright, we shall conclude of mammon as Paracelsus does of the Devil, that he
is a base and beggarly Spirit. For what I beseech you can he do? Can he make a
man honest, or wise, or healthy? Can he give a man to live more merrily, feed
more heartily, sleep more quietly? Can he buy off the gout, cares, death, much
less the pains of another world? Pro. 11.4.
Riches avail not in the day of wrath: if we lean upon this reed it shall
break, and run into our hands. He that trusts in riches shall fall, Prove.
11.28. Take heed therefore, as you love your souls, how you bestow your trust
upon riches: you may use them, and serve your selves of them: yea, ye may
enjoy them in a Christian moderation; God will allow it. That praise which the
Jesuits College in Granado gives of their Sanchez, that though he lived where
they had a very sweet garden, yet he was never seen to touch a flower; and
that he would rather die than eat salt, or pepper, or ought that might give
relish to his meat; like to that of some other Monks, that they would not see
the Sun, nor shift their clothes, nor cleanse their teeth; carries in it more
superstition and slaverie than wit or grace. Wherefore has God made these
creatures but for use? This niggardliness is injurious to the bounty of their
Maker. We may use them, we may not trust in them: we may serve our selves of
them, we may not serve them: we may enjoy them, we may not over joy in them. We
must be so affected to our goods as Theodorick the good King of Aquitaine was
with his play, in bonis jactibus tacet, in malis ridet, in neutris irascitur,
in utrisque philosophatur. But if we will be making our wealth a rival unto
God, the jealousy of God shall burn like fire against us. Now as the
disdainefull rival will be sure to cast reproaches upon his base competitor,
so does God upon riches, he calls them uncertain, yea uncertaintie it
self. Trust not in

Uncertain riches. Were our wealth tied to our life it were uncertain enough:
for what is that but a flower, a vapor, a tale, a shadow, a dream of a
shadow, a thought, a nothing? Yet our riches are more uncertain than life it
self: our life flies hastily away, but many times our riches have longer
wings, and out fly it. It was a witty observation of Basil, in Psalm. 61.
(...), etc. that wealth rowles along by a man like as a headie stream glides
by the banks: time will molder away the very bank it washes, but the current
stays not for that, but speeds from one elbow of earth to another: so does
wealth, even whilst we stay it is gone. Our life is as the tree, our wealth is
as the leaves or fruit; the tree stands still when the leaves are fallen. Yea,
many one is like the Pine tree, which, they say, if his bark be pulled off
lasts long, else it rots. If therefore life and wealth strive together
whether is more uncertain, wealth will sure carry it away. Job was yesterday
the richest man in the East, to day he is so needy, that he is gone into a
Proverb, As poor as Job. Belisarius the great and famous Commander, to whom
Rome owed her life twice at least, came to date obolum Belisario, give one
half penny to Belisarius. O miserable uncertainty of this earthly pelf, that
stands upon so many hazzards, yea, that falls under them! who would trust it?
who can dote upon it? what madness is it in those men which (as Menot says)
like unto hunters, that kill an horse of price in the pursuit of an hare worth
nothing, endanger, yea cast away their souls upon this worthless and fickle
trash. Glasses are pleasing vessels, yet because of their brittlenesse who
esteems them precious? nor flowers, though beautiful, because they are
fading? No wise man bestows much cost in painting mud walls: what mean we (my
beloved) to spend our lives and hearts upon these perishing treasures? It was a
wise meditation of Nazianzen to his Asterius, that good is to no purpose, if it
continue not: yea, there is no pleasant thing in the world, says he, that has
so much joy in the welcome, as it has sorrow in the farewell. Look therefore
upon these heaps, O ye wise hearted Citizens, with careless eyes, as those
things whose parting is certain, whose stay is uncertain; and say with the
worthy Father, By all my wealth, and glory, and greatness, this alone have I
gained, that I had something to which I might prefer my Savior; with whose
words I conclude this point. Lay not up for your selves treasures on earth,
where moth and rust do corrupt, and thieves break through and steal; but lay
up for your selves treasure in heaven.

But trust in God. Man cannot be without a stay, and therefore the same breath
that withdrawes one refuge from us, substitutes a better: even as a good
Carpenter in stead of a rotten groundsill lays a sound. The same trust then
must we give to God, which we must not give to riches him must we esteem above
all things, look up to him in all things, depend upon him for all things. This
is to trust in God, which the Psalmist in his sweet dittie says is a good
thing: good in respect of God; for our trust in him is one of the best pieces
of his glory: ( Joseph holds Potiphars trust a great honor.) 2. For us; for
what safety, what unspeakable comfort is therein trusting to God? Our Savior
in his farewell Sermon, John 16. persuading to confidence, says, (...) a word
signifying boldness: and what is there in all the world that can work the
heart to so comfortable and unconquerable resolution, as our reposall upon God?
The Lord is my trust, whom then can I fear? They that put their trust in the
Lord, are as mount Sion that cannot be moved. Oh cast your selves therefore
into those almighty hands, seek him in whom you shall find true rest and
happiness, honor him with your substance that has honored you with it:
trust not in riches, but trust in God. Riches are but for this world, the true
God is Lord of the other; therefore trust in him: riches are uncertain, the
true God is Amen, ever like himself; ergo trust in him: riches are mere
passive, they cannot bestow so much as themselves, much less ought besides
themselves; the true God gives you all things to enjoy: riches are but a
livelesse and senseless metal, God is

The living God. Life is an ancient and usual title of God; he for the most
part swears by it. When Moses asked his name, he described himself by I am:
He is, he lives; and nothing is, and nothing lives absolutely but he: all
other things by participation from him. In all other things their life and they
are two, but God is his own life: and therefore (as Aquinas acutely disputes
against the Gentiles) must needs be eternal, because being cannot be severed
from it self. Howbeit, not only the life he has in himself, but the life
which he gives to his creatures, challenges a part in this title. A glympse
whereof the heathen had when they called Jupiter (...), from (...) Those
creatures which have life we esteem beyond those that have it not, how noble
soever other ways those things be. Therefore he that has the perfectest life
must needs be the best. God therefore who is life it self, and fountain of all
that life which is in the world, is most worthy of all: the adoration, joy,
love and confidence of our hearts, and the best improvement of that life which
he has given us. Trust therefore in the living God, not in riches; that is
idolatry, yea madness. What greater madness can there be than to bestow that
life which we have from God, upon a creature that has no life in it self, nor
price but from men? Let me then persuade every soul that hears me this day as
Jacob did his household; Put away the strange gods that are among you: or as St.
Paul did his Lystrians; O turn away from these vanities to the living God, who
gives us richly

All things to enjoy. Every word would require, not a several hour, but a
life to meditate upon; and the tongues, not of men, but of Angels to express
it. God not only has all in himself, but he gives to us; and gives us not
somewhat, but all things; and not a little of all, but richly: and all this not
to look on, but to enjoy. (Here the Preacher said it should content him to top
the sheaves only, because he could not stand to thresh them out: it shall
content me with the Apostles to rub some few ears, because I cannot stand to
top the sheaves) Whither can you turn your eyes to look besides the bounty of
God? If you look upwards, his mercy reaches to the heavens; if downwards,
the earth is full of his goodness; and so is the broad sea: if you look about
you, what is it that he has not given us? air to breathe in, fire to warm
us, water to cool us, clothes to cover us, food to nourish us, fruits to
refresh us, yea, delicates to please us, beasts to serve us, Angels to attend
us, heaven to receive us, and (which is above all) his son to redeem us.
Lastly, if we look into our selves, has he not given us a soul rarely
furnished with the faculties of understanding, will, memory and judgment? a
body wonderfully accommodated to execute the charge of the soul? and an estate
that yields due conveniences for both? moreover, seasonable times, peace,
competencie, if not plenty of all commodities, good laws, religious, wise,
just Governors, happy and flourishing days, and above all the liberty of the
Gospel? More particularly, cast up your Books, O ye Citizens, and sum up
your receipts; I am deceived if he that has least shall not confess his
obligation to be infinite. There are three things especially wherein ye are
beyond others, and must acknowledge your selves deeper in the books of God
than the rest of the world.

First, for your deliverance from that woeful judgment of the Pestilence. O
remember those sorrowful times, when every month swept away thousands from
among you, when a man could not set forth his foot but into the jaws of death,
when piles of carcasses were carried to their pits, as dung to the fields, when
it was cruelty in the sick to admit visitation, and love was little better
than murderous.

Secondly, for your wonderful plenty of all provisions spiritual and bodily.
Ye are like the Sea, all the Rivers of the land run into you; nay, sea and
land conspire to enrich you.

Thirdly, for the privilege of your government: your charters, as they are
large and strong, so your form of administration is excellent, and the
execution of justice exemplarie. For all these you have reason to ask with
David, Quid retribuam? and to trust in God who has been so gracious unto you.
And thus from the duty we owe to God in our confidence, and his beneficence to
us, we descend to the beneficence which we owe to men, expressed in the
variety of four epithetes to one sense.

To do good, to be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to
communicate: all is but beneficence. This heap of words shows the vehement
intention of his desire of good works, and the important necessity of the
performance; and the manner of this expression enforces no less: Charge the
rich, etc. Hearken then, ye rich men of the world, it is not left arbitrarie
to you, that you may do good if you will; but it is laid upon you as your
charge and duty: the same necessity there is of trusting in God, is of doing
good to men.

Let me fling this stone at the brazen forehead of our Romish Adversaries, whom
their shameless challenges of our religion, dare tell the world, that we are
all for faith, and that we hold works to salvation as a parenthesis to a
sentence. Heaven and earth shall witness the injustice of this calumniation,
and your consciences shall be our compurgatours this day, which shall testify
to you, both now and on your deathbed, that we have taught you there is no
less necessity of good works, than if you should be saved by them: and that
though you cannot be saved by them, as the meritorious causes of your glory,
yet that you cannot be saved without them, as the necessary effects of that
grace which brings glory. Indeed we do not hover over your expiring souls at
your death beds, as Ravens over a carcass; we do not beg for a covent, nor
fright you with Purgatory, nor chaffer with you for that invisible treasure of
the Church, whereof there is but one key keeper at Rome: but we tell you, that
the making of friends with this Mammon of unrighteousness is the way to
eternal habitations. They say of Cyrus, that he was wont to say, He laid up
treasure for himself when he made his friends rich: but we say to you, that
you lay up treasures for your selves in heaven, whilst you make the poor your
friends on earth. He shall never be Gods heir in heaven, who lends him
nothing on earth. As the witty Poet said of extreme tall men, that they were
like Cypress trees, (...), so may I say of a straithanded rich man: and these
Cypresses are not for the Garden of Paradise. None shall be ever planted there
but the fruitful: and if the first Paradise had any trees in it only for
pleasure, I am sure the second, which is in the midst of the new Jerusalem,
shall have no tree that bears not twelve fruits; yea, whose very leaves are
not beneficial. Do good therefore, O ye rich, and show your wealth to be
(not in having, but) in doing good: and so do it, that we may thank you (not
your deathbed) for it. Late beneficence is better than none, but so much as
early beneficence is better than late. He that gives not till he dies, shows
that he would not give if he could keep it. That which you give thus, you give
it by your testament, I can scarce say you give it by your will. The good man's
praise is dispersit, dedit, he disperses his goods, not he left them behind
him: and his distribution is seconded with the retribution of God, His
righteousness endures for ever, Psalm. 112.9. Our Savior tells us, that our
good works are our light: Let your light so shine, that men may see your good
works. Which of you lets his light go behind him, and has it not rather
carried before him, that he may see which way it goes, and which way himself
goes by it? Do good therefore in your life, that you may have comfort in your
death, and a crown of life after death.

Here the Preacher filled up his border with the gifts of this City, as it
were so many precious stones: in stead whereof, because I am not appointed to
rehearse your deeds, but the Preachers Sermon, I will fill it up with the
praises of the Speaker. His sentences were vere lineae aureae, (according to
Junius his translation of my text) cum punctis argenteis; the latter whereof
interlaced his whole discourse. It remains that as I have done in the former,
so I work the emblem of the giver in his gift. The Image shall be Marcus
Callidius, the Motto or words the words of Tullie, De claris Oratoribus. Orator
non unus e multis, sed inter multos singularis; reconditas exquisitasque
sententias mollis and perlucens vestiebat oration. Nihil tam tenerum quam illius
comprehensio verborum, quae ita pura erat, ut nihil liquidius; ita libere
fluebat, ut nusquam adhaeresceret; nullum nisi in loco positum, and tanquam
emblemate vermiculato verbum structum videres: accedebat ordo rerum plenus
artis, actio liberalis, totumque dicendi genus placidum and sanum.

THE THIRD BORDER: OR HORTUS DELICIARUM.
The third border of gold, with studs of silver, which the third Speaker
offered to the Spouse, was wrought upon those texts, Genesis 2.15, 16, 17. And the
Lord God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it, and
to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
Garden thou may freely eat. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, thou shall not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
shall surely die. And thus he put it on.

THis Scripture contains in it seven particulars: of which by Gods assistance
in order. The third Sermon, preached by Dr. Hacket, sometimes fellow of new
College in Oxon, abridged.
1 Who took: The Lord God. 2 Whom: The man Adam. 3 What he did with him: He
placed him in Paradise. 4 To what end: To dress and keep it. 5 God his large
permission to the man: To eat of all other trees. 6 His restraint from the tree
of knowledge. 7 His punishment if he refrain it not: Thou shall die the death.


1. Who took.
The Lord God, Jehovah, Elohim. In Jehovah note the Unity, Elohim the Trinity
of persons. Jehovah signifies that he is of himself, and gives to all other
to be: for he is, as Damascene teaches, the being of them that be, the life
of all that live. Elohim signifies which rules and disposes all. Of this
Almighty Maker and Disposer of all, the more we speak, the more we have to
speak; the more we think of him, the more we find him greater than our
thoughts: and therefore with silence admiring that majesty, which neither
tongue of men nor Angels can express, I pass to the second particular:

The Man. Man consists of a body and a soul: 2. Whom.
his body was made of the earth, his soul was inspired by God, not propagated
by generation. The soul does neither beget, nor is begotten, says
Chrysostom, but is infused by God, who is said by the Preacher to give the
soul, Eccl. 12.7.
The Spirit shall return to God that gave it: and in this respect is called by
the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, The Heb. 12 9.
Father of Spirits. Upon which words St. Jerome infers, Ridendi sunt qui
putant animas cum corporibus seri: and St. Austine refelleth that opinion by
Adams words concerning Eve, This is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; (he
says not, soul of my soul.) In this part of man, man is said to be made
according to Gods own Image, (for the Epiphan. haeres. 70.
Audians heresy, which attributed the corporal lineaments of man to God, is
long ago exploded) and that in a threefold respect:

1. In respect of the faculties of the soul; 1. Understanding. 2. Will.


2. In regard of the qualities of the soul; 1. Lightsome knowledge. 2. Perfect
holiness.


3. In regard of the rule that God gave him over all creatures. So St. Basil
expounds those words, Let us make man after our image, adding, imperiale
animal es O homo, quid servis affectibus? to whom Chrysostom, Athanasius,
Aquinas, and all the Schoolmen assent. And let this suffice to be spoken of
the man: in the third place follows

Put him into the Garden of Eden. 3. What he did with him.
Of this Garden two questions are disputed on by Divines: 1. Whether this
Garden were a real place in the earth. 2. Whether Paradise yet remain.


To the first I answer, that questionless Paradise was a true and real
Garden, as S. Jerome and Chrysostom affirm against Origin. Origines sic
allegorizat ut historiae tollit veritatem; non licet nobis ita nugari, and
simpliciorum auribus imponere, dicendo nullum fuisse in terris hor tum, quem
vocant Paradisum: and Bellarmine proves it sufficiently against the fancy of
Franciscus Georgius.

To the second I answer, That the place of the earth remains in substance,
though it is not now a Paradise, or hortus deliciarum: for the beauty of it is
gone. The curse of the whole earth, to bear thorns and thistles, is come upon
it. As for the Paradise mentioned in Saint Luke 23.43.
Luke, and in the Apoc. 2.7.
Apocalypse, it was celestial: and Saint 2 Cor. 12.4.
Paul makes it plain, where having said he was rapt up into the third
heaven, by and by he names the place, Paradise. Upon which words Saint
Ambrose thus commenteth, Paradisum intelligit coelestem, de quo Dominus dixit
latroni, hodie mecum eris in Paradiso. You have heard where the Lord placed
him: it remains that we enquire in the fourth place

4. To what end God placed him there.
To dress and keep the garden. God had not yet cursed the earth, neither were
the wholesome herbs degenerated into weeds. Every plant and herb brought
forth fruit according to their kind, and God that made them good, could have
preserved them in that state of goodness: but man had need of some employment,
and therefore God enjoined him to dress this garden of pleasure in this place,
to make use of his gifts, and by his reason and industry to model it into some
delightful form: yet was his labor without all pain, nay, it was full of
pleasure. But why is it added, to keep it? Surely (says St. Austine) no
invading neighbor was feared to put him out of possession, nor thief to rob
him of his choicest plants; but God would have him therefore to keep it to
himself, ne inde projiciatur. This is wittily inferred by him: but it seems
the natural meaning of the place is this, that he should not only dress it,
as at the first, but with continual care keep it. God would not have man
idle, no not in Paradise. Thus briefly of his dressing and keeping: now we are
to consider in the fifth place

5. Gods large permission.
That he might eat of every tree in the Garden. Behold Gods bounty: there was
not only the delicacy of all fruits, but variety; and Adam was not limited to
some few, he might eat of every tree: neither was he for a short time to have
enjoyed this, if he had harkened to the command of his Lord. For in the midst
grew the tree of life, of which he might eat at his pleasure: the other trees
(says S. Lib. 13. e Civit. Dei.
Austine) were given to him to satisfy his hunger and thirst, but this to give
vigor to him, and keep him from infirmity, age, and death: yet this grant was
not so general, but that it had annexed unto it a restraint, which we are to
consider of in the sixth place:

6. His restraint.
From the t^ee of knowledge. It was not so called (as Antiq. ^uda^^. l. 3. c. 9.
Josephus dreamed) because it had a virtue in it to sharpen the understanding,
that man might know God the better. (For it was as the other trees of the
Garden, without sense or knowledge:) but it was entitled so in a double
respect:

1. Because joined to the commandment, it was an outward sign, showing what
was good, viz. what God commanded; and what was evil, viz. what God forbad.

2. In respect of the event. As the waters of Meribah or strife were so called,
because Israel there contended: so was this tree called the tree of knowledge
of good and evil, because hereby Adam knew experimentally what good there was
in obeying, and what evil in disobeying; what good in innocence, and what
evil in iniquity; what good within the bounds of Paradise, and what evil in
the accursed world. St. Sermon. 14. de ver^. Dom.
Austine thus opens the matter, Do not touch this tree. Why? What is this
tree? If it be good, why should I not touch it? If it be evil, what makes it
in Paradise? Doubtless it was good; why then may be not touch it? That father
answers sweetly, quia obedientem te volo, non contradicentem; serve, prius
audi domini jussum, and tunc jubentis disce consilium. God, like a good
Physician, showed Adam what was hurtful; Adam like an intemperate patient,
would not refrain it.

7. Hi^ punishment if he restrain it not.
In the day that thou eatest thou shall dye. The same day thou forsakest me in
thy disobedience, I will forsake thee in my justice: thou shall dye, first, the
death of the body, and after, the death of the soul, if thou believe not in
the promised seed: and not thou only in thy person, but all thy children stand
and fall in thee: they stand in thy obedience, and in thy disobedience they
fall: and in the truth of this let all confess to the glory of God, Iniquum
est ut been sit desertori boni, it was sin in Adam to forsake his Maker, it
was justice in God to punish him that in this manner had forsaken him.

Thus much for the opening of the Text. Let us now apply it to this honorable
assembly.

1 This Garden of Eden may well be compared to our mother the Church.

2 This man, to our spiritual and temporal Rulers.

3 This placing man in Paradise, to their calling, that is, of God.

4 This dressing and keeping it, to their labors in their charge.

5 The eating of every tree, to their reward.

6 Their restraint from the tree of knowledge, to that which is forbidden them.

7 This threatened death, to the punishment of all transgressors.

1 Touching our Church, and her resemblances to Paradise. 1 As Paradise was
separated from other parts of the earth, so this Land: the Poet calls us,
Toto divisos orb Britannos. 2 As Paradise was beautified with the lights of
nature: so our Church with gifts of grace above nature. 3 As Paradise was beset
with fair trees, that hare pleasant fruits: so our Church with many Pastors,
whose lives are fair to behold, and the fruits of their lips sweet to taste. 4
In the midst of Paradise was the tree of life, in our Church Christ crucified:
on whom whosoever feeds by faith shall live for ever. So that what Jacob
spoke of the place where he was, may be said of our Church; This is no other
than the house of God. For albeit there be many plants in this Garden which the
Lord has not planted; many wild branches that need pruning, many dead, not
enlived by Christ, many poisonous weeds, many flowers fair in show, but of a
stinking savor; and no marvel: (for in the Arc there was a Cham, in Abraham's
house an Ishmael, in Jacobs family a Reuben, in David's Court an Absalom, in the
number of Christ's Disciples a Judas, nay, in heaven a Lucifer.) Yet since our
Church striveth to pluck up these weeds, and unsavourie or unfruitful plants,
and desires to be freed of them, it may truly be called the Garden of God. For
as St. Ad Felician.
Austine says, The Goats must feed with the sheep till the chief shepherd
come. Ille nobis imperavit congregationem, sibi reservavit separationem: ille
dabit separare qui nescit errare.


2 Touching our Rulers and Governors resemblance to the man. Adam, whom God
appointed Ruler over all the creatures, was furnished with gifts agreeable. God
made greater lights to rule the day and night: so should they be great in
wisdom, and great in goodness that are to enlighten others. I am not to
flatter you, nor to reprove you: happy is that Church whose Rulers are so
qualified.

3 Touching the comparison of Adams placing in Paradise with our calling.

1 I note, that God was not wooed with friendship, nor won with money, nor
swayed with affection, to place Adam in Paradise; but of his own voluntary
motion he placed him there. Let us tread in the steps of our heavenly Father.
When Omph. in vit. Clem.
Clement the fifth Bishop of Rome was importuned by his kindred, and offered money
to confer a benefice upon an unworthy man, he answered, Nolo obtemperare
sanguini, sed Deo: let us take on us the like resolution. For what an uncomely
thing is it to set a leaden head upon a golden body? to make fools rulers of
wise men? 2 I note, that Adam did not ambitiously affect this place, nor by
indirect means sought to wind himself into it; but God took him by the hand,
and placed him there: but now I fear St. Jeromes speech is true of diverse,
Presbyteratus humilitate despecta festinamus episcopatum auro redimere. 3 I
note, Adam was not created in Paradise, but by his maker placed in it. Let me
apply this to you the right worshipful Governors of this City: You were not
born, but brought by God to this rule and government; though as clouds you
soar aloft, yet were you but vapors drawn from the earth: it is God that
has lifted up your heads, as he raised David from the sheepefold, and Joseph
from the dungeon. Wherefore in acknowledgment of your own unworthiness, and
Gods goodness to you, say you with Genesis 32.10.
Jacob, With my staff passed I over this Jordan. Say you with David, 1 Samuel
18.11.
Quis ego sum? aut quae est cognatio mea? Ascribe the glory of your wealth and
honor to God, kiss the blessed hand that has lifted you up, and consider
with me in the next place why God placed you here.
4 Touching Adams dressing and keeping Paradise, and your charge. St. Ambrose
well observes, that though Paradise needed no dressing, yet God would have
Adam to dress it, that his example might be a law to his posterity to dress
and keep the place of their charges. It is not enough for you to be good men,
ye must be good rulers. He that has an office must attend upon his office: it
is opus oneris, as well as opus honoris. Ye must not be like antickes in great
buildings, which seem to bear much, but indeed sustain nothing: neither must
ye lay the whole burden upon other men's shoulders, since the key of government
is laid on yours. Now in dressing the Garden, three duties are especially to be
required: 1 To cast and model the Garden into a comely form: Of which I need
to speak nothing. Your form of government may be a president to other Cities
of this kingdom: strangers have written in praise of it. 2 To root up and cast
out stinking weeds. Among which I would commend two to your special care; 1
Papisme. 2 Puritanisme.



I deny not but that it belongs to the special care of our Bishops to pluck
up these weeds: yet as Judas said to Simon, Help thou me in my lot, and I will
help thee in thine; so ought both Spiritual and Temporal Governors join
hands in rooting out these weeds.

1 Of Papisme. In the days of Jehosaphat that good King, it is recorded, that
the high places were not taken away, because the people did not set their heart
to seek the God of their Fathers. The Papists seek to their God of Rome the
Distinc. 96.
Pope, as the Canonists style him, not to the God of heaven, nor the God of
their Fathers. Did their Forefathers in the Primitive Church equal traditions
with Scripture? consecrate oratories to Saints? pray in an unknown tongue?
mutilate the Sacrament? adore the wafer, and call it their maker? did they sell
indulgences to free men from Purgatory? Saint Peter taught us to be subject
to 1 Pet. 2.13.
every humane ordinance: St. Paul commands every Romans 13 1.
soul to be subject to the higher powers. The Primitive Christians in Tert. ad
S^p.
Tertullians time, though they were cruelly persecuted by the heathen
Emperors, and had power and strength enough to revenge themselves; yet they
never lifted up their hands against any of those bloody Tyrants. Hear their
profession in Tertullian, Nos nec Nigriani, nec Cassiani sumus, we are no
Nigrians, no Cassians, no Rebels, no Traitors; we fill all your Cities,
Islands, Towns, yea, your Palace and Senate: What were we not able to do, if
it were not more agreeable to our Religion to be killed, than upon any pretense
to kill? On the contrary, the Papists teach that it is not only lawful, but
a meritorious act, to lay hands upon the Lords anointed, if he favor not
their Idolatries and Superstitions; witness Cardinal Como his instructions to
Parry, and Sixtus his oration in defense of the Jacobine that murdered Henry
the third. Had the Apostles preached this faith to the world, should they have
converted the world? Was this the practice of the Primitive Church? Is this
Religion to make murder spiritual resolution, to eat their God upon a
bargain of blood? Cannot God propagate his truth but by these wicked and
damnable means? Origin writes that some unskilful Emperickes dealt with
their Patients not to consult with learned Physicians, lest by them their
ignorance should be descried: even so the leaders of Papists deal with them,
they will not suffer them to hear our Sermons, or consult with our Divines,
not for love to their followers, lest they should be ensnared by us; but lest
their falsehood should be discovered.

2 Of Puritanisme. By Puritans the Preacher professed that he understood not
those who are usually branded with that name, but a sect of impure Catharists
or Donatists, styled The Brethren of the Separation, who refuse to partake with
us in our Prayers and Sacraments, whose God is their fancy, and Religion the
dream of their own heart; who seek to build a Babel of confusion among us:
but the God of heaven confound their tongues. Was not the Church of Corinth
more corrupted in Doctrine and Manners than they pretend ours to be? yet Saint
Paul calls it a Church. Does not Christ call it his field where there grew
many tares? Did not Christ suffer Judas, whom he knew to be a Thief and a
Traitor, to partake of the Sacrament with his Disciples? Yet these pure
Sectaries will none of our Communion, for that some unclean persons presume to
come thither. To whom we answer as Saint Lib. 3. c. 50. and ep 48.
Austine does to Cresconius, These evils are displeasing to the good; we
forbid and restrain them what we can, what we cannot we suffer: but we do
not for the tares sake forsake the field, for the chafe leave the floor of
Christ, for the evil fish break the net, for the Goats sake refuse the fold
of Christ. When Religion was partly corrupted, partly contemned in Israel, and
the Prophets cried, Go out from them, and touch no unclean thing, did they
then sever themselves from them? I find no such thing (says Saint In Evang.
Sermon. 8.
Austine) yet doubtless they did themselves what they willed others to do.
Hoc ergo est exire ore non parcere, hoc immundum non tangere, voluntate non
consentire: liber in conspectu Dei est, cui nec Deus sua peccata imputat quae
non fecit, neque aliena quae non approbavit, neque negligentiam, quia non
tacuit, neque superbiam, quia ab unitate Ecclesiae non recessit.

3 To nourish the tender and feeble plants, that is, to show mercy on them that
are in need. When I call to mind your Almes-houses for the poor, your
Hospitalls for the maimed, your houses of correction for idle persons; I cannot
but commend your care in this behalf: this City may be a president for all
other places: the Garden of Eden never smelt so sweet in the nostrils of Adam,
as the remembrance of these your works of mercy in the nostrils of Almighty
God. Nunquam veterascet haec manus. Eccles. 11.1.
Cast thy bread upon the waters, and after many days thou shall find it; but
see thou cast the bread thou have justly gotten: Quicquid enim (says St.
Gregory) ex scelere in Dei sacrificio affertur, non placat Dei iracundiam, sed
irritat. Secondly, Cave ne rem pauperum non pauperibus tribuas, and liberalitas
liberalitate pereat. Thirdly, give that thou intendest whilst thou live. For
thou know not how thy Will will be performed. Hear what St. Basil says:
When thou shall have no name among the living, thou say, I will be liberal:
Is not this to say in effect, I would live always, and enjoy my substance? but
if I die then I give: We may thank thy death for thy bounty, 2 Cor. 9.7.
not thee. Be not deceived, God would have a living (not a dead) sacrifice.
Lastly, you must continue in good order the several places of your charge: the
cursed earth will still bring forth weeds, wherewith your garden for want of
care will be soon over-growne. Remember Saint Paul's cursum consummavi: non
cepisse sed perfecisse virtutis est, nec inchoantibus sed perseverantibus datur
proemium. And so I fall upon my fifth point.

5 Touching the reward. Ye shall not dress Paradise in vain, God will be
unto you as unto Abraham, a buckler and exceeding great reward: he will build
up your house, and bless you in all your ways; yea, he will give you to feed
on the tree of life in the midst of the Paradise of God.

6 Touching the prohibition. Since God is so bountiful to permit you to eat of
all other trees, eat not of the tree of knowledge: you shall not be as Gods,
though the Devil tell it you, nor gain heaven by it, but lose Paradise.
Naboth's vineyard, Uriah's wife, Achan's golden wedge, Belshazzar's quaffing
bowls, Gehazi's bribes were forbidden fruit, sweet in the taste, but death in
the stomach.

7 Touching the punishment. Although corporal death seizes not forthwith upon
offenders, yet the sentence is passed against them: the life of grace is
departed from them, and except by repentance they seek to have part in the
first resurrection, they shall be cast into the lake of fire without
redemption. To conclude all, let us that are desirous to walk with God, as our
callings require, seek to dress and keep the garden, our mother Church and
Country: let us not make our selves like briars to scratch her, or thorns to
prick her, or weeds to annoy her; but as blessed plants let us bear
plentiful fruits to comfort and nourish her.

Thus this Speaker, as if he had tasted of the tree of life, which, as Josephus
writes, prohibuit senium and mortem; this aged Paul discoursed unto you of the
Garden of Eden in a flourishing style: he, as the former two, presented the
Spouse with a precious border, wherein I am now to work his emblem,
consisting, as the former, of an Image and a Motto; the Image is Triarius, the
Motto the words of Tullie, de claris Oratoribus. Me delectabat Triarii in illa
aetate plena literatae senectutis oration: quanta severitas in vultu? quantum
pondus in verbis? quam nihil non consideratum exibat ex ore? I was much taken
with the learned oration of Triarius that ancient Orator: what gravitie was in
his countenance? what weight in his speech? how did he ponder every word that
proceeded out of his mouth?

THE FOURTH BORDER: OR, THE SACRIFICE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.
The fourth border of gold, with studs of silver, which the fourth Speaker
offered to the Spouse, was wrought upon that text, Psalm. 4.5. Offer the
sacrifice of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. And thus he put it
on.

Right Honorable, etc.
GOd has made us a feast of many days: The fourth Sermon, preached by master
Francis White, now L. Bishop of Ely, and L. Almoner to his Majesty.
that we be not unthankful unto him, let us offer him a sacrifice, especially
that which is prescribed in the words of my text. Wherein you have a double
precept, 1 Of righteousness. Wherein observe 1 The act, Offer. 2 The matter, a
sacrifice.
2 Of hope and confidence. Wherein observe 1 The act, Trust. 2 The object, in
the Lord.



1 Of the act, Offer. To offer is to exhibit and show forth such works before
God, as please him, and testify his power and goodness; and we are said
herein to offer unto him in regard of our intention herein to perform
acceptable service unto him, and our desire to glorify him: not as if God
received any things at our hands: for our goodness Psalm. 16: 2. Hier. ad
Celant.
reaches not to him. If thou be righteous it is nothing to him, what receives
he at thine hand? Obsequio nostro non indiget Deus, sed nos illius indigemus
imperio. And albeit the Scripture attribute hands to God, yet it is to give,
not to receive any thing from us. (O that our Demigods, Judges and
Magistrates, had but such hands! O that they were like unto Artaxerxes
Longimanus, not to take bribes, nor extort, but to reach justice!) What does
the Chrysostom. 2 Cor. hom. 30.
Sun receive from the eye which it enlighteneth? or the Aug. de civit. Dei l.
10.
fountain from the mouth which it refreshes and cools? or the anchor from
the ship which it foundeth and establishes? Notwithstanding, though God
receive nothing from us, as any accession to his infinite perfection, and his
simplicity excludes any addition thereunto; yet he requires our sacrifices as
his rent and fee, and we are continually to offer them unto him; and that in a
threefold respect:

1 Of God. Tert. l. 4. cont. Marcion.
Cui omne altum inclinat, cui omnes debent (...), cui omne debemus quod sumus,
quod possumus; from whom we Jam. 1.17.
receive all things.

2 In respect of our own condition, who are Gods workmanship, and therefore
ought to be serviceable to him; his field, and therefore ought to bear fruit
unto him, his royal Priests, and therefore ought to offer spiritual
sacrifices unto him.

3 In respect of the benefit which redoundeth to us by these spiritual
sacrifices. Cast up any thing toward heaven, it falls down back again: even
so if we send up the savor of good works to heaven, it will distill down
again like sweet waters upon our heads: as on the contrary, the sins of Sodom
sent up a steame to heaven, which congealed in the air, and turned into a
storm of sulphur, and rained down upon their heads. To offer unto God, what
is it else than to scatter seed on earth, that we may receive fruit in heaven?
to open our laps and bosom, that Gods treasure may fall into it? to lay the
sure foundation of a building not made with hands? to stoop and kneel down
before God, that he may put upon us a Crown of glory, as Noblemen when they
receive a Coronet from the King? Herein note the difference between those
things which are offered to God, and those that are offered to the world: those
that are offered to God are preserved, and returned back upon us; but those
things that are offered to the world perish themselves, and destroy us; as a
talent of lead sinkes it self, and drownes him on whom it is cast. Pereat ergo
mundi lucrum, ne fiat animae damnum. There was never heard of such a bankrupt
as the world, which breaks every week, nay, every day, and undoeth
thousands: it uses the worldling as Sueton. in Vesp. c. 16.
Vespasian did his catchpole officers, who, when they had filled themselves
with rapines and spoils, picked some occasions to squieze them like spunges,
and crush out all that they had gathered, and draw them dry.

1 Whence we may learn how wise and happy they were, who have been
benefactors to Hospitalls, Colleges, and the like places; who, whilst they
lived, offered sacrifices of righteousness to God. For their gifts are doubly
restored unto them in a name among men; so long as one stone shall lie upon
another in these buildings, their praise shall be read: secondly, in an
immarcessible crown in heaven. As on the contrary, you may discover their
folly, who offered all their wealth and means to the world, to pride, to lust,
to riot: whose reward is vanity whilst they live, rottenness when they die,
shame and confusion when they arise.

2 This may serve to stir us up to exhibit willingly our offerings to God.
Offer of your selves; God loves a cheerful giver. How cheerfully does the
husbandman go out to sow his seed? yet after he has sown it, it is subject to
many casualties. How easily do fruitful trees part with their ripe fruit? A
full and frontie ear sheds of himself; but on the contrary, a withered and
blasted ear, crush it and beat it never so much, it will yield nothing but
chafe and dust: a perfect emblem of a greedy griper, a sordid churl; hammer
him how you will, strain him, squieze him, thump him, yet you shall get
nothing from him but that which is sordid and illiberall, like himself.

3 This may serve to reprove those qui non afferunt, sed auferunt, that are so
far from offering unto God, that they take away from him, either his glory
and worship, as the Papists and all Idolaters do; or his tithes and oblations,
as our sacrilegious harpies; of whom we may truly say, Nihil tam sacrum quod
non inveniat sacrilegum. But let these Church-robbers remember that they
swallow a golden hook which shall be raked out of their bellies, as Job
speaks. Some part offerings between God and Mammon, as S. Austin speaks of
Cain, Sua Deo, sibi seipsum dedit. In sum, there is a threefold abuse in things
offered to God:

1 Extreme niggardnesse and Mal. 1.14.
deceit, which God accurseth.

2 Bribery and corruption in ordering and disposing of things offered unto God,
in conferring Benefices upon Churchmen, or bestowing places in Hospitals; not
upon the fittest for such offices and places, but such as by their purse can
make best friends.

3 Diversion of things consecrated unto God, to maintain lust and pride. A
lamentable thing that Hospitals erected for the maintenance of the poor,
should not be free from oppression: one Bell-wether carries away all the wool
and the fat, and rangeth whither he pleases, when the poor Bedesman is kept
to his mathematical line, a small pittance God wot, a penny a week, or a
morsel of bread a day. Thus much of our first observation.

2 The second observation from the act is, that the word in the original
signifies mactando offerre, to offer as it were by slaughter; which intimates
that we must use a kind of violence to our selves in the performances of these
duties. For we have many lusts and affections in us, as envy, contention,
pride, covetousness, which are more clamorous than any beggars, and like
horse-leaches suck out all our estate and means: besides, we have many
worldly occasions; the belly craves, the back craves, yea, and braves it too,
the wife claims, yea, and exclaimes, children ask, and friends challenge a
great part; that even in an ample state little or nothing remains for God: so
that unless a man put a sacrificing knife to the throat of his concupiscence,
and cut the windpipe of his worldly desires, and bind himself as it were with
cords to the horns of the Altar, the flesh and the world will devour all, and
nothing will be left for charity to bestow, but a few scraps cast into the
almes-basket.

The sacrifices of righteousness. In these words I note four particulars: 1
Rem, Sacrifice. 2 Numerum, Sacrifices. 3 Qualitatem, of righteousness. 4
Effectum, and trust in the Lord.


Rem, Sacrific^. Sacrificium (as Lib. 10. de Civit. Dei, c. 6.
Austine defines it) est omne opus bonum quod agitur ut sancta societate
inhaereamus Deo, relatum ad illum finem boni quo veraciter beati esse possimus.
Sacrifices are either, 1 Legal: and these of three sorts, 1 Burnt-offerings. 2
Sinne-offerings. 3 Peace Offerings.
2 Evangelicall: and these may be divided, as the schools speak, into 1
Sacrificium redemptionis, seu universalis sanctificationis. 2 Sacrificia
specialis sanctificationis.



For the Legal, they were umbrae futurorum; viz.

1 Of Christ's sacrifice. In which respect Nazianzen calls them (...); St.
Lib. 2. cont. Faust. Manich. c. 17.
Austine terms them praedicamenta unius very sacrificii: and St. Cyril says,
Parturiebant veritatem sacrificii.

2 Of the spiritual sacrifice of Christians, that is, holy offices of Religion
and charity. So says St. Lib. 10. de Civit. Dei, c. 5.
Austine, Quaecunque in mysterio tabernaculi and de sacrificiis leguntur, ad
Dei and proximi dilectionem referuntur: and Justin Martyr, Figurae eorum quae
vel praedestinati ad Christum, vel Christus ipse gesturus erat. Now as the
shadow vanishes in the presence of the body, so these after Christ's oblation
upon the Cross, Tunc (as Lib. 4. cont. Marcion. c. 1.
Tertullian speaks elegantly) compendiatum est Novum Testamentum, and legis
laciniosis operibus expeditum: As those that cast metals, says L. de spiritu
sanc.
Cyril of Alexandria, first make a mold, after the fashion of the bell,
vessel, or image which they cast; but after the metal has run, and the
vessel is cast, or the work finished, they lay aside their mold of earth: so
after the work of our redemption was finished, the types and molds of the law
were cast away. This Origin after his manner expresses by an excellent
allegory: Til Isaac was born and weaned, Hagar and Ishmael remained in Abraham's
house, but afterward they were turned out of doors: so til Christ the true
Isaac was born and weaned, the bondwoman and her son, the Old Testament and
types thereof, remained in the Church: but after his birth and ascension they
were for ever cashiered.

For Evangelicall sacrifices, they are of two sorts: 1 The prime and
sovereign. 2 Subordinate and secundarie.


1 The prime and sovereign is of Christ himself, who offered his body for our
redemption, and by his blood entered into the holy place: of which St. Austine
excellently notes, Unum manebat cum illo cui offerebat, unum se fecit iis pro
quibus offerebat, unus ipse erat qui offerebat and offerebatur.

2 Subordinate sacrifice: to this are referred

1 The sacrifice of commemoration, or the commemoration of Christ's bloody
sacrifice in the Sacrament of our Lords supper, Tert. de pudicit. c. 9.
quo opimitate dominici corporis vescimur, and anima de Deo saginatur, which in
this respect In Psalm. 95.
Chrysostom calls coeleste, simulque venerandum sacrificium; and Irenaeus,
novi testamenti novam oblationem.

2 The works of charity, which are called 1 Pet. 2.5. Heb. 13.16. De idelis.
sacrifices; and we must still offer them, if we believe Tertullian;
Spiritualibus modo hostiis litandum Deo: and Con. Juli. l 10.
Cyril, Crasso ministerio relicto mentalis fragrantia oblationis. And these we
are to offer the rather, because we are eased of the burden of the other. The
difference between us and those under the law is not in the duty of offering,
but in the kind of sacrifice: Iren. l. 4. c. 34.
oblationes hic, oblationes illic. Quippe cum jam nona servis sed a liberis
offerantur, Cap. 21.
omnes justi sacerdotalem habent ordinem: not to distribute the mysteries of
salvation, but to offer spiritual sacrifices to God.

2 Numerum, Sacrifices in the plural number: plural in specie and in
individuo. For we are to offer diverse kinds of sacrifices, and we are often to
offer them. There are ordinary sacrifices and extraordinary, morning and
evening; sacrifices of the soul, and sacrifices of the body; internal and
external; whereunto St. Lib. de spirit. sanct.
Cyril applies that description of Solomon's Queen, Psalm. 45. All glorious
within, in inward devotion, and in a vesture embroidered with gold, in respect
of her outward oblations. It is not enough to offer to God inward sacrifices,
we must offer also outward. First, because God requires them. Secondly,
because we receive from him outward blessings. Thirdly, because we sin in
outward things, and therefore ought to seek to Quo sensu opera placant Dei
iram. Vid. in fra.
pacify and appease his wrath by our outward sacrifices. Of these there are
diverse kinds: I will note three.

1. Of alms and charitable deeds, whereunto the 1. Tim. 6. Heb. 13.
Apostle exhorts: 1. Cor. 13.
Of these three the greatest is charity: haec est Regina virtutum, says S.
Chrysostom; it is as the purple robe which in ancient time was proper to
Princes. If thou see this purple robe of charity upon any, say certainly he
is the child of God, he is an heir of the kingdom of heaven.

2. Of mortification, whereunto the Romans 12.1.
Apostle exhorts. Hereby we express the 1. Cor. 9.27. 2. Cor. 4.8.
dying of the Lord Jesu in our bodies; 1. By temperance in our diet, which is
not more salubrious to the body, than healthful to the soul. 2. By fasting,
which without doubt is an act tending to religion, and helping it. For so we
read, Luke 2.37.
Anna served God with fasting and prayer: and Christ promises a Mat. 6.13.
reward unto it; and the Fathers generally make fasting and almsdeeds the two
wings, carrying our prayers to heaven. 3. By Christian modesty in apparel,
habit and deportment: cura corporis, incuria animae. The pride and luxury of
this age in this kind exhausteth men's estates, and eats up all their holy
oblations. What shall I speak of our plastered faced Jezebels, who are worse
than those Idols which we have cast out of our Churches? Those are but dead
Idols, these are living, and rank themselves with our gravest Matrons: all
bounds of modesty are broken, and marks of honesty confounded.


3. Of obedience, whereunto the Heb. 13.
Apostle exhorts. If obedience be better than sacrifice, the sacrifice of
obedience must needs be the best sacrifice. Yet so has the Devil blinded
many, that they place the greatest Religion in disobedience. God accepted not
Corah his sacrifice, because he sacrificed in schism: nor will he of their
outward religious acts, who stand in opposition to the Churches authority.
Government is as necessary in the Church as in the Commonwealth.

3. Qualitatem sacrificiorum, sacrifices of righteousness, that is, sacrifices
rightly offered. Chrysostom shows the manner; the sanctified will (says he)
is the altar, charity the fire, the sword of the Spirit the knife, the hand
faith.

4. Effectum, the effect of these sacrifices. As good works partake in the
name, so have they the effect and virtue of sacrifices. In a good construction
they may be said to appease Gods wrath, and to procure unto us spiritual and
temporal blessings: they may be said to appease Gods wrath three ways;

1. By taking away the fuel thereof, viz. sins. For as light expels
darkness, so the sacrifice of righteousness expels impiety and iniquity,
which provoke Gods wrath.

2. By brightning the Image of God in us, and making it more conspicuous: this
(...) inflame Gods love to us in his beloved Christ Jesus. Certainly as (...)
^^aments and jewels make a Spouse more amiable in the eyes of her hus^ (...)
good works, when their imperfections are covered with the robes of (...)
righteousness, make the soul more amiable in the sight of God and men.

3. By making us capable of a greater measure of Gods love and favor. For
though they are no way meritorious causes of Gods blessings spiritual or
temporal, yet are they as precious dispositions and conditions in the subject:
and as these appease Gods wrath, so they may be said to impetrate of God
spiritual and temporal blessings.

In this argument this grave and learned Divine expatiated, alleging many
remarkable passages out of the ancient Fathers: namely, out of Saint
Chrysostom, in Heb. hom. 33. Talibus sacrificiis placatur Deus: S. Ambrose de
penit. l. 2. c. 4. Qui agit poenitentiam non solum diluere lachrymis debet
peccatum suum, sed etiam emendatioribus factis operire, and tegere delicta
superiora, ut non ei imputetur peccatum: Gelas. cont. Pelag. council. Tom. 2.
Tam jugi supplicatione, quam eleemosynis, caeterisque bonis actionibus
expiandum est peccatum: August. ep. 54. Misericordiae operibus expiatur
peccatum: Fulgent. ep. 2. Agnoscamus opera bona locum orationis habere apud
Deum: Hilar. in Matthew. can. 4. Charitas errorum nostrorum ad Deum ambitiosa est
patrona: Tertull. de patient. c. 13. Mortificatio aures Christi aperit,
severitatem dispergit, clementiam illicit: Greg. moral. 9. c. 14. Verba nostra
ad Deum sunt opera quae exhibemus: Et in Psalm. 7. poenit. Quid est manibus Deum
exquirere, nisi sanctis operibus invocare Salvatorem? Cyp. ep. 8. Admoneo
religiosam solicitudinem vestram ut ad placandum atque exorandum Dominum, non
voce sola, sed and jejuniis and lachrymis, and omni genere deprecationis
ingemiscamus: Chrysostom. 2. Cor. hom. 20. Spiritum vocas non verbis, sed factis
opus clamat, and fit sacrificium.

And now that I have set before you the gift of the fourth Speaker, viz. a
border of gold with studs of silver; it remains that I work in it, as in the
three former, his emblem, consisting of an Image and a Motto: the Image is
Cotta, the Motto the words of Cicero, de claris Oratoribus: Inveniebat acute
Cotta, dicebat pure, nihil erat in ejus oratione nisi siccum and sanum. Cotta
his invention was acute, his elocution was pure, and there was nothing in his
Sermon which was not solid and sound.

THE REHEARSERS CONCLUSION, OR THE FASTENING THE BORDERS TO THE SPOUSE HER
NECK AND BREAST.
PLiny Plin. l. 2. not. hist. c. 44. Metellae Crassi uxoris sepulchrum ita
constructum est, ut quinquies candem verborum sententiam regerat.
writes of an Echo sounding from the Tomb of Metella, Conclusion.
which repeated the same sentence five several times: this five-fold Echo I
am now become in your ears, eandem sententiam quinquies regerens, rehearsing
now my Text five times, four in repetition and application to the four
Preachers, and now the fifth time in the conclusion and application to my
self. Vary the translation as you please, yet the collation will still hold;
if you stand to the last, and read the words, we will make thee borders of
gold with studs of silver, the collation is already made: for the four borders
are the four methodicall discourses, beautified with variety of art and
learning, which I have imperfectly rendered; and nothing remains, but that
(as it were) with a silk string or ribbon I gather the rows of pearl, and
all the borders of gold together (which before I took off, that we might more
particularly view them) and fasten them all to the Spouse her neck and breast
by drawing toward an end, and pressing close my exhortation to the heart of
this great assembly. If you follow learned Junius his translation, Faciemus
tibi aureas lineas cum punctis argenteis, you may be pleased to interpret the
four lines of gold drawn at length, to be the four Texts handled and
unfolded at large by the Preachers: and the puncta argentea, or the points of
silver, special notes of observation upon them, placed as points or pricks in
a line, some in the beginning, some in the middle, and some in the end. The
points beginning and continuing we have already passed, and are now come to
puncta terminantia, the closing points; or rather period and full poin of all.
But if you prefer the Seventies translation before either, and will have the
Text rendered thus, Faciemus tibi similitudines auri cum punctis argenteis, We
will make thee similitudes or resemblances of gold with points of silver; my
application shall be in the words of Origin, Nos tibi aurea ornamenta facere
non possumus, non tam divites sumus ut Sponsus, qui aureum tibi monile
largietur; nos similitudines auri faciemus. And indeed what are the imperfect
notes which I have imparted to you, but similitudines, obscure resemblances of
those borders of gold I spoke but now of? In which respect, as when Marcellus
in his Pageant brought in golden Statues or Images of the Cities he had taken,
and afterward Fabius brought in the same carved in wood; Chrysippus said
wittily, Has illarum thecas esse; so it may be truly said, that the Sermons
which I have repeated were but illorum thecae, covers, or at the best tables
and indexes of theirs: the blame whereof lies not wholly upon the broken
vessel of my memory, or my noters: for though the vessel be sound, and set
direct under the spouts mouth, it is not possible* but that some drops should
fall besides, and others be blown away with the wind. The heavenly doctrine
of the Preachers powered down in great abundance like great showers of rain
from heaven, they themselves were as golden spouts, at whose mouth though I set
my pitchers as close and steady as I could, yet many silver drops went besides
them; notwithstanding you see they are full and run over. Take you yet
another similitude, that you may have similitudines, according to the letter of
my Text, as the Seventy read it. The four Sermons were like four Garlands
crowning the Spouse of Christ, out of which I have culled some of the chiefest
flowers; and howsoever in the plucking of them and sorting them many leaves are
shattered, and some flowers lost, yet there are more left than can be
contained within the handful of the time allotted. Wherefore now I will leave
gathering, and fall to making up my Posie, winding up all the flowers orationis
meae filo, with the remainder of the third of my discourse upon the Text.

We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. As out of the branches
of trees there shoot first buds, then blossoms, and last of all fruit; so out
of Texts of Scripture, which are branches of the tree of life, issues first
the literal sense, which because it grows immediately out of the bark and
stock of the letter, resembles the bud: and then the spiritual, which
because it is most pleasant and beautiful to the eye of the soul, may be
likened to the blossom: and thirdly the moral sense, which because it is most
fruitful, and immediately profitable for our instruction, may be termed the
fruit. To illustrate this by the words of my Text, or rather the words of my
Text by it. The literal sense is of Solomon his Queen, richly decked; the
spiritual is of Christ his Church, rarely furnished; the moral is of sacred
vows religiously to be performed. You see 1 The bud of the literal, 2 The
blossom of the spiritual, 3 The fruit of the moral sense.
But herein you are to observe a remarkable difference between the tree of life
and other trees: for their buds are but a degree to the blossoms, and the
blossoms to their fruit, neither bud nor blossom bear fruit; but in the tree
of life both the bud, which I compared to the literal, and the blossom, which
I called the spiritual, and the fruit, which I termed the moral, bear
several and distinct fruits. For instance, the bud yields this fruit, That it
is lawful for noble and honorable women, especially Kings wives and
daughters, to wear rich attire and costly ornaments. The blossom yields this
fruit, That as Gods goodness has abounded to the Church under the Gospel, so
all Christians ought to abound in love and thankfulness to him. Lastly, the
moral sense, which I termed the fruit, yields over and above this fruit,
That what the friends of the Spouse here promise, all godly pastors and people
ought to perform, that is, these out of the riches of their learning, they out
of their worldly wealth ought to adorn and beautify the Church, and in
different kinds make for the Spouse of Christ borders of gold with studs of
silver.

To gather first the fruit of the bud, or literal sense. If costly apparel
and precious attire were an abomination to the Lord; if cloth of gold and
silver, and borders of pearl and precious stones were as great a deformity to
the mind as they are an ornament to the body, the Scripture would not set out
Genesis 24.22.
Rebecca in bracelets and abiliments of gold, nor Ezekiel. 6.11, 12.
Ezekiel in the person of God upbraid the Synagogue as he does: I decked thee
with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thine hands, and a chain on thy
neck, and I put a jewel on thy forehead, and eare-rings in thine ears, Ver
13.
and a beautiful crown upon thy head; thus wast thou decked with gold and
silver, and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk: nor Solomon described his
Psalm. 45.9.
Queen in a vesture of gold of Ophir: neither the Prophet Esaias 61.10.
Esaias have compared the Spouse of Christ clothed with the garments of
salvation, and covered with the robes of righteousness, to a Bride adorned
with jewels. And therefore howsoever Saint 1 Timothy 2.9.
Paul, and Saint 1 Pet. 3.3.
Peter forbid women to array themselves with gold, or pearls, or costly array:
and Saint De habitu Virg.
Cyprian is yet severer against costly apparel, saying, Nullarum fere
pretiosior cultus est, quam quarum pudor vilis est: and, Serico and purpura
indutae Christum induere non possunt, auro and margaritis, and monilibus
ornatae ornamenta pectoris perdiderunt (which I spare to English in favor of
that sex): yet, as I conceive, the holy Apostles and the devout Father in
these and the like wholesome and necessary admonitions, condemn not simply Gods
servants for the use, but rather profane persons for the abuse of these
beautiful creatures of God; they seek to abase the pride of the heart, not
abate the price of these merchandises. They tax, and that most justly, three
vices too common in these luxurious times, 1 Vanity in the garish form of
apparel. 2 Excess in the costly matter or stuff. 3 Indecency and immodesty
in both, or either.
Or they speak comparatively, that women should not so much desire to Antiph.
Poet. (...).
adorn their outside with resplendent pearls, as their inward parts with
jewels of virtue and grace.

We have gathered the fruit of the bud: come we now to the blossom, that is,
the beautiful allegory or spiritual sense; which contains in it a gracious
promise made to the Church, either of larger bounds and limits, likened to the
borders of gold, or of a greater measure of knowledge in holy Scriptures, quae
sensibus aureae sunt eloquii nitore argenteae, Rupertus, Isidorus, and
Gregorius.
or abundance of the gifts of the spirit, which no otherwise adorn the Church
with their variety, than a golden chain or border wrought about with studs or
specks of silver. Now if God has made good these his promises to us, shall we
make frustrate our holy vows to him? the better he has been to us, the worse
shall we prove to him? has he made more of us than any Nation upon the earth,
and shall we make less of him? No, the more we have received at his hands, the
more let us lift up our hearts and hands unto him, or else for our
unthankfulness he will take the chains and borders of gold from our Church,
and put them on some other, that will more thankfully accept them. O let us
resemble these resemblances in my Text, the borders of gold with studs of
silver, which, as they receive luster from the Sunne-beames, so they gild them,
and reflect them back with clearer light, and greater heat. Sacrilege has
already picked out, and plucked away many Oe's and Spangles of silver from our
Church, Heresy begins to corrupt her gold, God grant for our ungratitude and
security in time we lose not both.

I will close up your stomach, and my discourse, with the fruits of the moral
sense of this Text. For the tree of life herein resembles the Persian
Pomecitrine, which (as Theophrastus and Pliny write) Simul frondescit,
florescit, and fructificat; at the same time has buds, blossoms, and fruits
on it: and which is more strange in this than in that, each of these bear
their several fruits. You have tasted the fruits of the bud or literal sense,
and of the blossom and spiritual; let us now pluck the fruits of the moral.

We. Who speak here? The three persons, say three of our prime late Divines,
Junius, Mercer and Whitaker: nay rather, says Rosetus out of Origin and
Jerome, the friends of the Bride, or her companions. For this Song is a kind of
divine Pastoral, or Marriage play, consisting of diverse acts and scenes; or a
sacred Dialogue with many interlocutory passages. First, the Bride comes in and
says, Let him kiss me with the kisses of his lips: then the Bridegroom, I
have compared thee, O my love, to a troop of horses in Pharaoh's chariots; thy
cheeks are comely with rows of stones, and thy neck with chains. After
which words he withdraws himself, and sits at his repast, Ver. 12. and
leaves the Bride with her companions, as it were alone on the Stage; who thus
speak to her, We will make thee, etc. The words in the original being
indifferent to either Interpretation, I will rather be an Electicke, than a
Critic, choose out of both, than censure either. Admitting then the friends of
the Bride to parley with her, what say they? We will. Which we? we of the
Clergy, or you of the Laity? We of the Clergy, says Aquinas, Rupertus, Sanct.
in bunc loc. Nam in murenulis Scriptura sacra ostenditur, quae auro
spiritualium sensuum fulget interius, and argento coelestis eloquii nitet
exterius.
Sanctius, and Isidorus Hispalensis. For by the borders of gold are meant the
holy Scriptures, which shine inwardly with the gold of spiritual senses, and
outwardly with the silver of heavenly elocution. Nay, rather ye of the Laity,
will others say: for we of the Clergy may say truly with Peter, Aurum and
argentum non habemus, we have no gold to make borders of, nor silver to make
studs of. If it be lawful for me to interpose my sentence, I would say
questionless both: for both are retainers to this Queen, both are friends and
servants of this Spouse, bothy owe homage unto her, both must offer unto her
gold, silver, and precious stones: we out of the treasury of our knowledge, you
of your wealth and substance. Our borders of gold are methodicall and elaborate
Sermons and Treatises; yours are charitable deeds: we make the Spouse borders
of gold by sacred collections out of Scripture; you by liberal collections,
according to Scripture: we by setting forth learned works tending to devotion;
you by showing forth noble works of bounty and magnificency, proceeding from
devotion, first of our works, and then of yours.

1 First, I observe it is said we will make thee borders, in the plural
number, not a border of gold, with studs of silver, in the singular. It is not
sufficient to make the Spouse one border, be it never so rich; we must make her
many borders. Christ his threefold pasce injoyneth at least a double diligence
in preaching: John 21.15, 16, 17. Syn. sect. c. 19. (...), etc.
pasce after pasce teaches us that we must draw line upon line, urge precept
upon precept, lay link upon link, and join pearl to pearl, to make the
Spouse a border. Peradventure you will say better one excellent Sermon than
many mean and ordinary, Nardi parvus onyx eliciet vini cadum: one border of
true pearl is more worth than a thousand of glass or sophisticate stones; one
picture drawn with true and rich colors stands in more than many slubbered
over with slight wash colors. I grant it; and it were to be wished that they
who preach seldomer did it always more accurately, that the defect in the
number might be supplied in the weight of their Sermons: but certainly
experience shows, that the water corrupts in the conduits, that are so
stopped that they either run not at all, or but sparingly: and that the golden
spouts which adorn the Temple, and run more frequently and fully, yield the
sweetest and most wholesome water: and St. Basil. ep. (...).
Basil observes the like of Wells, that they grow the better the more water is
drawn out of them. Howsoever, considering the dullness of hearing, and mean
capacity of the ordinary hearer, and brittlenesse of memory in all, I wish
those that are of most eminent gifts to dispense the mysteries of salvation
more frequently than they usually do, under pretense of more accurate
preparation: because it is most true which Eras. Apoph. in Catone.
Cato said in his defense for distributing pieces of silver amongst his
soldiers, whereas other Captains bestowed gold on them: Melius est ut plures
argentum quam pauci aurum referant, it is better that many should bear away
silver than a few only gold; or to clothe my allegory with the words of my
text, that many, if not all, receive from them studs of silver, than a few, or
perhaps some one, a border of gold.

2 Secondly, I observe that it is here said borders of gold: the matter of the
borders or chains must be gold, the matter of our Sermons must be the pure
word of God, which is compared in Scripture to the purest 1 Pet. 4.11.
gold. If any man speak (says St. Peter) let him speak as the Oracles of
God: not Popish legends, not scholasticall subtleties, not moral essays, no
nor sentences of holy Fathers, as the groundwork of their building; but as
buttresses or ornaments only. For as In Mat. hom. 21.
Origin rightly infers, Sicut omne aurum quod fuit extra templum non est
sanctificatum, ita omnis sensus qui reperitur extra divinam Scripturam, etsi
admirabilis, non est sanctus; as no gold without the Temple was sanctified, so
no sense or sentence is holy, though it seem never so admirable, if it be
without the Scripture, that is, neither expressed therein, nor deduced by good
consequence from thence.

3 Thirdly, I observe that it is said borders of gold, with studs of silver:
this gold must be wrought into borders, our observations and meditations upon
Scripture must be digested into order; and they may be illustrated also with
variety of humane learning, and choice observations and sentences of other
eminent writers, as it were studs of silver: such as we find not only in St.
Jeromes epistles, and St. Austines books of the City of God, and Eusebius his
tractates De praeparatione, and demonstratione Evangelii, and Clemens
Alexandrinus his Stromata; but also in the divinely inspired writings of St.
Paul.

4 Fourthly, I observe that it is said borders of gold, with studs or spangs of
silver, not borders of gold and silver, much less borders of silver, with
studs of gold: the borders of gold were not made to set out the studs of
silver, but contrariwise, the studs of silver to beautify and illustrate the
borders of gold. We must not apply divinity to art, but art to divinity, lest
we deservedly incur the censure of St. Basil. ep 62. (...).
Basil upon some preachers in his days, They preach art and wit, and not
Christ crucified. We must not make our Scripture texts serve to vent our
secular learning, but contrariwise, modestly, and moderately use secular
learning to explicate and Sanctius in hunc locum. Concionatores ars talis esse
debet, ut auri nitorem non obscuret sed accendat, quod in monili praestant
argentei vermiculi.
illustrate texts of Scripture: sentences of Fathers, and other Authors, may be
scattered in Sermons, as spangs of silver about the Spouse her border, the
border must not be made of them. A fair Quintil. inst. orat. Ut affert lumen
clavus purpurae loco insertus, ita certe neminem deceat intexta pluribus notis
vestis.
jewel in the hat, or pendants at the ear, or a chain of gold or strings of
pearl about the neck, become the parts well: but to be all hung about with
four hundred distinct jewels as Lollia Paulina was, and not only to bore the
ears with rings, but also to dig holes in the cheeks, chinne and lips, and
there stick precious stones after the manner of the Bertius Geograph.
Peruvians, were vain folly, if not madness. I have done with our task, I
come now to yours.

Although it properly appertains to our skillful Bezaleels and Aholiabs to
make borders and chains for the Spouse, yet you are to contribute at least to
the making of them: it is your duty to bring into her wardrobe jewels of gold,
and jewels of silver, and jewels of raiment. It is not enough to love God with
your strength, you must honor him also with your substance. It is not only
required that you communicate with your Pastors in the Word and Sacraments, but
also that you communicate to him that teaches Gal. 6.6.
in all good things: you have not well acquitted you of your devotion when you
have given Christ your ears, you must farther give eare-rings to his Spouse:
it will not excuse you to write Christ his words in the palms of your hands,
if you make not bracelets for her arms: you have not done all when you have
bowed your neck to his yoke, you must farther deck her neck with chains:
there is something more required of you than to put on the Lord Jesus, you must
cloathe his Queen in a vesture of gold. Where can you better bestow your
wealth than upon the Church which receives of you glass, but returns you
pearl; receives from you carnal things, returns to you spiritual;
receives from you common bread, returns to you sacramental; receives from
you covers of shame, returns to you robes of glory: in a word, receives
from you earthly trash, returns to you heavenly treasure? When God commanded
the people to bring Exodus 35.5.
offerings to the Lord, they brought them in so freely, that there needed a
Proclamation to restrain their bounty. And Livie reports of the Romans, that
when the Tribunes complained that they wanted gold in the treasury to offer to
Apollo, the Matrons of Rome plucked off their bracelets, chains and rings, and
gave them unto the Priests to supply that defect. And who knows not that our
Forefathers in the days of ignorance placed all Religion in a manner in
building religious Houses, and setting them forth most gorgeously? O let not
the Jews exceed us Christians, let not Heresy, Idolatry and Superstition
outstrip true Religion in sacred bounty. If their devotion needed bridles, let
not ours need spurs: If they built Temples upon the ruins of private
families, let not us build private houses upon the ruin of Temples: If they
turned the Instruments of luxury into ornaments of piety, let not us turn
ornaments of piety into instruments of luxury. As nothing is better given than
to God, so nothing is worse taken than from his Church. Will God, think you,
enrich them, who spoil him? will he build their houses, who pull down his?
will he increase their store, who rob his wardrobe? will he clothe them with
his long white robe, who strip his Spouse of her attire and comely ornaments?
Nay rather, as Aeneas, though before he had purposed with himself to spare the
life of Turnus, yet when he espied Pallas girdle about him, Et Virg. Aenid.
notis fulserunt cingula bullis. he changed his mind, and turned the point of
his sword to his heart, saying, Tun' hinc spoliis indute meorum eripiere mihi?
so our blessed Redeemer, when he sees his Priests garments upon sacrilegious
persons, and the chains and borders of his dearest Spouse upon their minions
necks, will say, Tun' hinc spoliis indute meorum eripiere mihi? shall thou
escape judgment, who have robbed me thy Judge? shall I spare thee, whom I
find with mine own goods about thee? shall thou get out of my hands, who
quaffest like Belshazzar in the bowls of my Sanctuary, and bravest it in my
Spouse attire?

Now, as the special operations of the soul reflect upon themselves; and, as
definition defines, and division divides, and order digesteth, so also
repetition may and ought to repeat it self. For the close of all then I will
recapitulate my recapitulation, and rehearse my self, as I have done the four
Preachers.

Of this parcel of Scripture, Faciemus, etc. I have made a threefold
explication, and likewise a threefold application; the first explication was of
the rich attire of Solomon's Queen; the second of the glorious types of the
Jewish Church under the Law; the third of the rich endowments, large borders,
and flourishing estate of the Church under the Gospel. My application was first
to the Clergy; secondly, to the Laity; thirdly, to this present exercise. The
friends that here promise to adorn the Spouse with rich borders, I compared to
the four Preachers, their Sermons to the four borders, both in respect of the
matter and the form: their matter was Scripture doctrine, like pure gold;
their form exquisite art beautifying their Scripture doctrine with variety of
humane learning, and sentences of the ancient Fathers, like spangles or studs
of silver. In the borders of Solomon's Queen, there was the representation of a
Dove, whence they are called Torim, which Brightman in Cant.
some translate Turtures aureas; and their preaching was not in the enticing
words of man's wisdom, but in the evidence of the spirit, which descended in
the likeness of a Dove. The borders were joined together, and in their Sermons
there was good coherence: for whereas there are two parts of Divinity, 1. The
first de Dei beneficiis erga homines. 2. The second de officiis hominis erga
Deum.
The former were handled in the two former Sermons, and the later in the two
later.

The benefits of God are either 1. Spiritual, as Redemption, of which the
first discoursed. 2. Or Temporal, as the wealth of the world, of which the
second.


The duties of man to God are either

1. Proper to certain men in regard of their special place or calling, as
Magistrates or Ministers, of which the third.

2. Common to all Christians, as to offer sacrifices of righteousness to God,
of which the fourth.

The first, as a Herald, proclaimed hostility, Awake, O sword, etc.

The second, as a Steward of a Court, gave the charge, Charge the rich, etc.

The third, as a Judge, pronounced a dreadful sentence, In the day thou eatest
thou shall dye the death.

The fourth, as a Prophet, gave holy counsel and heavenly advice, Offer, etc.
That we may be free from, and out of the danger of the blow of the first, and
the charge of the second, and sentence of the third, we must follow the advice
of the fourth. All four may be likened to four builders,

The first fitted and laid the corner stone.

The second built a house, whose foundation was laid in humility, Charge the
rich that they be not high minded: The walls raised up in hope, to lay hold on
eternal life: The roof was covered with charity, that they be rich in good
works.

The third beautified it with a garden of pleasure, and he fenced it with the
Discipline of the Church, as it were with a strong wall.

The fourth built an Altar to offer sacrifice.

The first made according to the last Translation borders of gold: his special
grace was in the order and composition.

The second, according to Junius his version, Lineas aureas, golden lines: his
grace was in frequent sentences and golden lines.

The third, according to the Seventies interpretation, made Similitudines
aureas, golden similitudes, comparing our Church to Paradise.

The fourth (as Brightman renders the words) made turtures aureas, golden
turtles, gilding over, if I may so speak, our spiritual offerings with a ric^
discourse of his own. Pliny Lib. 37. not. hist c. 2 In Opale est Carbunculi
tenui^r ignis Ame^hysti fulgens purpura and Smaragdi virens m^re, etc.
writes of the Opall stone, that it represented the colors of diverse precious
stones; by name the Ruby or Carbuncle, the Amethyst, the Emrald, and the
Margarite or Pearl. In like manner I have represented unto you in this
Rehearsal the beautiful colors of diverse precious stones: in the first the
color of the Ruby; for he discoursed of the bloody passion of Christ. In the
second the purple color of the Amethyst; for he treated of riches and purple
robes, and the equipage of honor. In the third the green color of the Emrald;
for he described the green and flourishing garden of Eden. In the fourth, the
clear or white color of the Crystal or Pearl; for he illustrated unto us
the sacrifices of righteousness, which are called white, in opposition to the
red and bloody sacrifices of the Law. The Opall represents the colors of the
abovenamed precious stones, incredibili mystura lucentes, shining by an
incredible misture: a glimpse whereof you may have in this brief concatenation
of them all. God has given us his Son the man, that is, his fellow, to be
sacrificed for us, as the first taught; and with him has given us all things
richly to enjoy, as the second showed: not only all things for necessity and
profit, but even for lawful delight and contentment, placing us as it were in
Paradise, as the third declared. Let us therefore offer unto him the sacrifice
of righteousness, as the fourth exhorted. Ye whom God has enriched with
store of learning, open your treasures, and say to the Spouse of Christ, out of
these we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. Ye of Gods
people, whom he has blessed with worldly wealth, open your treasures, and say
to the Spouse of Christ, out of these we will make thee borders of gold with
studs of silver: and then be ye assured, God will open the treasures of his
bounty, and the three persons in Trinity will say, We will make you borders of
gold with studs of silver; and not only borders for your breasts, and chains
for your necks, but also eare-rings for your ears, and bracelets for your
hands, and frontlets for your faces, and a crown for your heads: we will
enrich you with invaluable jewels of grace here, and an incorruptible crown of
glory hereafter. So be it heavenly Father, for the merits of thy Son, by the
powerful operation of the Holy Spirit. To whom, etc.

THE ANGEL OF THYATIRA ENDITED. A Sermon preached at the Cross, Anno 1614. THE
XXXIII. SERMON.
REVEL. 2.18, 19, 20. And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira, write, These
things, says the Son of God, who has his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and
his feet like fine brass:

19. I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience,
and thy works, and the last to be more than the first.

20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou suffer
that woman Jezebel, which calls her self a Prophetess, to teach and seduce
my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols.


Right Honorable, etc.
Apoc. 1.12.
IF the seven golden Candlestickes which Saint John saw, were illustrious types
and glorious emblemes of all succeeding Christian Churches, as many learned
Commentatours upon this mysterious prophecy conceive, and the seven Letters
written to the seven Churches of Asia immediately represented by them, as well
appertain to us in the autumn, for whom, as to those prime-roses that
appeared in the spring of Christian piety and religion, to whom they were
directed: we may without scruple seize on this indorsed to the Angel of the
Church of Thyatira, break open the seals, and peruse the contents thereof,
which seem better to sort with the present state of our Church, than of any
that at this day bears the name of Christian. Wherefore I make bold to unfold
it, and altering a word only in the superscription, thus I read and expound it
in your ears, and pray God to seal it up in your hearts.

To the Angel that is Guardian, Centinell, or chief Watchman of the Church of
England, thus writes the Son of God by eternal generation, who has eyes
like a flame of fire to enlighten the darkest corners of the heart, and
discover the most hidden thoughts: and his feet like fine brass, most pure,
that can tread upon none but holy ground. I know thy works to be many, and thy
love to be entire, and thy service to be faithful, and thy faith to be sound,
and thy patience to be invincible, and thy works, and the last to be more
than the first. The fair and magnificent Colleges lately founded, and
Churches sumptuously repaired, and Libraries rarely furnished, and Schools
richly endowed, and Students in the Universities liberally maintained, and the
poor in Hospitals charitably relieved, are standing testimonies and living
evidences thereof: Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, that thou
suffer the woman that sits upon seven hills, the mother of harlots, and
abominations of the earth, Jezabel of Rome, which calls her self a
Prophetess, and Mistress of all Prophets and Prophetesses, by Priests and
Jesuits to teach and deceive my servants, to make them commit spiritual
fornication, and freely communicate with Idolaters; and I gave her space to
repent, sixty years at least, that she might not complain that I began with
violent and extreme courses, and launced her wounds whilst they were green;
but all this while she has not repented of her Superstitions and abominable
Idolatries: therefore I will lay it heavy upon her, I will send plague after
plague, and heap sorrow upon sorrow, and add affliction to affliction; and if
all will not serve, I will pour out the dregs of my red wine on her, and
quench the fire of my wrath with her stained blood. I will kill her children
with death, and all the Churches shall know that I am he that searches deep
into the wounds of the heart and reins, and discover filthiness and
corruption in the inward parts; and I will give unto every one according to his
works; but unto you I say, and to the rest in great Britain, as many as have
not this doctrine of the Romish Jezabel, and which have not known the depths
of Satan her mysteries of iniquity, I will put upon you no other burden of
Laws or Canons but that which you have already: Hold fast till I come to
judgment.

In this Letter observe we 1. The superscription mysterious, Ver. 18. 2. The
contents various, presenting to our religious thoughts 1. A sweet insinuation,
Ver. 19. 2. A sharp reprehension, Ver. 20, 21. 3. A fearful commination, Ver.
22, 23. 4. A comfortable conclusion, Ver. 24.



In the superscription we have an admirable description of the glorified body
of our Redeemer, which shines more brightly than a flame of fire, or the
finest metal glowing in the furnace: Secondly, an eminent title attributed to
the Bishop or Super-intendent of the Church in Thyatira: The Angel.

To the Angel in Thyatira, says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame
of fire, to Bullengerus in hunc locum. Illuminat alios, alios igne sempiterno
concremat.
inlighten the godly, and burn up the ungodly: and feet like brass, to
support his Church, and bruise the enemies thereof, I know thy works,
proceeding from thy love, and thy love testified by thy service, and thy
service approved by thy faith, and thy faith tried by thy patience; and that
the silver springs of thy bounty have more overflowed at the last, than at the
first. Thus far the sweet insinuation, which afterward falls into a sharp
reprehension, like as the sweet river Solinus c. 20. Hypanis Scythicorum amnium
princeps haustu saluberrimus, dum in Exampeum fontem inferatur, qui amnem suo
vitio vertit.
Hypanis into the bitter fountain Exampeus. Notwithstanding I have an action
against thee, that thou suffer the filthy Strumpet Jezebel to corrupt the
bodies and souls of my servants, by permitting corporal fornication to them,
and committing spiritual with them, whose judgment sleeps not, no not in
her bed, but even there shall surprise her. For behold, I will cast her into a
bed: where she has cast her self in wantonness, I will cast her in great
weakness, and will make her bed of pleasure a rack to torment her: Ubi
peccavit punietur, where she swilled in her stolen waters that rellished so
sweet in her mouth, she shall take down her bitter potion; Ubi oblectamentum
ibi tormentum. Of which plagues of Jezebel, when God shall open the vials
mouth: at this time I purpose to gather some few observations from the two
former branches of this Scripture; but to insist wholly upon the third: in the
explication whereof, when I have proved by invincible arguments that Jezebel is
not to be tolerated; in the application I will demonstrate that the
Pseudo-catholike Roman Church, otherwise called the Whore of Babylon, is
Jezebel, or worse, if worse may be: as God shall assist me with his Spirit,
and endue me with power from above, for which I beseech you all to join with
me in prayer.

O most gracious God, etc.

And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira, write, etc. The Naturalists
observe, that the thickest and best honey is that which is squeezed last out of
the comb: and usually the daintiest dish is served in at the last course; and
Musicians reserve the sweetest strain for their close: and Rhetoricians take
special care of their peroration. The last speech of a dying friend leaves a
deep impression in our hearts; and art, imitating nature, holds out the last
note of the dying sound in the organ or voice: which consideration should
stir up our religious thoughts and affections to entertain with greatest
alacrity and singular respect the admonitions and prophecies delivered in this
book, as being the last words of our Lords last will and testament, Sen. ep.
12. Gratissima sunt poma cum fugiunt, deditos vino potatio extrema delectu, etc.
and the last breath as it were of the Spirit of God. If that of the Poet be
true, that the beams of the Esse Phoebi dulcius solet lumen jamjam cadentis.
Sun shine most pleasantly at his setting, how pleasant and dear ought the
light of this Prophetical book be unto us, which is the last irradiation and
glissoning of the Sun of righteousness? In it discern we may 1. Counsels,
chapt. 2.3. 2. Predictions of the state of the Church. 1. Militant, from the
4th to the 21. 2. Triumphant, from the 21. to the end.



The manner of delivery of both to Saint John, was by special revelation;
which you will better conceive, if you be pleased to take notice of the means,
whereby all knowledge divine and humane is conveyed into the soul. As all
water arises either from Springs below, or falls from the Clouds above; so
all knowledge is either gathered from the creatures by natural reason,
grounded upon experience, or immediately descends from the Father of lights,
and is attained unto by supernatural illumination.

Supernatural illumination is either 1. By ordinary inspiration, common to all
the Penmen of the holy Ghost, who wrote the dictates of the Spirit, and were
so assisted by him, that they could not set down any thing amiss. 2. By
extraordinary revelation; which may be either 1. Of things past, whereof there
remain no records, monuments, or memorialls to furnish the writer of them:
such was the story of Genesis before the Flood, whereof Moses could be no
otherwise infallibly informed, than by Gods revealing them unto him. 2. Of
things to come, which is properly termed prophecy; and this may be either 1. By
instinct, when men or women foretell things to come, not knowing the
certainty, or being fully persuaded of the things themselves. 2. Per raptum, or
ravishing of Spirit, when they foretell such things, whereof they are
infallibly assured, either 1. By voice, as Moses was. 2. By dream, as Daniel.
3. By vision, as Esaias, Ezekiel, Zechary, and other Prophets.





By instinct I am easily induced to believe, that many, especially before their
death, may foretell many things that come to pass shortly after; and I deny
not but some also may per raptum, as I am persuaded John Hus did before his
martyrdom in those words, which are stamped in the coin of those days yet to
be seen: Centum revolutis annis respondebitis Deo and mihi, after a hundred
years you shall be called to an account for these things: about which time
they were openly challenged for them by Martin Luther, and other zealous
Reformers. Yet are we not to build our Christian faith upon any prophesies,
save those only which holy men have set down in Scripture, as they were guided
by the holy Ghost. Among which this is to be ranked, which Saint John received
not from man or Angel, but from Cap. 1. V. 9, 10.
Jesus Christ; not per instinctum, but per raptum, as himself testifies: I
John, which also am your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the
kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the Isle of Patmos, for the word
of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I was in the spirit on the Lords
day, and heard behind me a great voice as of a Trumpet. Note we herein, that
Saint John received this revelation in his exile or banishment, to teach us,
that Gods servants may be banished out of their native soil, and the Court of
Princes, but not out of the Catholic Church, or the presence of God.
Secondly, Saint John received this prophecy as he was in the spirit, to
intimate unto us, that this book is of a spiritual interpretation. Thirdly,
he received it on the Lords day, to lesson us, that God most blesses our
meditations on this day; and that they must be at peace with him, and free
from worldly cares and business, who expect revelations from him.

For the title of the book of Apocalypse, or Revelation, it is taken either
from the manner whereby it came to Saint John before mentioned, or from the
matter herein contained, which is mystical, hidden, and for the most part of
things future, very obscure before the event and issue manifest them, not from
Saint John's manner of expressing them: for that for the most part is very
intricate. For, as Plato sometimes spoke of an obscure example, Exemplum, O
hospes, eget exemplo, You had need to illustrate your example by another
example; so of all the books in Scripture the book of Revelation most needs a
revelation and clear exposition: in which, as Saint Jerome has observed, Quot
verba, tot Sacramenta, there are near as many mysteries and figures, and
aenigmaticall expressions, as words: for this is the book spoken of in this
book, Apoc. 5.1.
sealed with seven seals, answerable to the seven letters enclosed in it,
directed to the seven Churches of Asia, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Sardis, Pergamus,
Philadelphia, Laodicea, and Thyatira, which names are as it were a small table
and short draught of the lineaments of these Churches. As Irenaeus his
peaceable temper, and Lactantius his milkie vein, and Eusebius his piety, and
Chrysostomes golden mouth; and contrariwise Jacobs subtilty, and Edoms cruelty,
and Nabals folly, and Seneca his end, Se necans.
and Protesilaus his destiny were written in their names: Ovid. ep.
Protesilae tibi nomen sic fata dedere,
victima quod Troiae prima futurus eras.
so the special and most noted virtues and vices in these Churches may be
read by the learned in the Greek tongue in their names. I dare not affirm,
that the holy Ghost either imposed or made choice of these names, to intimate
any such thing; especially, because these names were given to these Cities,
before they gave their names to Christ. Neither do we read, that these names
at the first were put upon these Towns by men endued with a Prophetical
spirit; but by their Heathen Founders or Governors: yet is the correspondency
between these names, and the condition of these Churches at the time when Saint
John, as Christ his amanuensis, wrote these letters to them, very remarkable:
and they may serve the learned as places in artificial memory, to fix the
character of these Churches in them.

1. By the name Ephesus, so termed, quasi (...), or (...), signifying remission
or slacking, they may be put in mind of slacking or backsliding, wherewith
the Spirit upbraideth this Church, Cap. 2. Ver. 4.
Thou have left thy first love: remember whence thou art fallen, and repent.

2. By the name Smyrna, signifying lacrymam myrrhae, the dropping or tears of
myrrh, they may be put in mind of the Ver. 10.
cup of tears, which this Angel was to drink: Ye shall have great
tribulation for ten days.

3. By the name Pergamus, quasi (...), or (...), signifying beyond, or out of
the bounds of marriage, they may be put in mind of the Nicolaitans abounding in
this Church, who were great abusers of Ver. 15.
marriage: Thou have them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which
thing I hate.

4. By the name Sardis, quasi (...), signifying fleshly, they may be put in
mind of many in this Church that were Cap. 3. Ver. 4.
fleshly given: for, as we read, This Angel had but a few names which had not
defiled their garments.

5. By the name Philadelphia, signifying brotherly love, they may be put in
mind of this virtue, whose proper work it is, to cover multitude of sins;
which because it was eminent in many of this Church, the Spirit covers all
her infirmities, and rebukes her openly for nothing; but contrariwise
commends her, and promises, because she Ca. 3. Ver. 10.
had kept the word of his patience, to keep her from the hour of temptation.

6. By the name Laodicea, quasi (...), signifying the righteousness or
customs of the people, they may be put in mind of the condition of the
common sort in this Church and elsewhere, who are well conceited of
themselves, though (God knows) for little cause: they imagine that they are
very forward in the way that leads to eternal life, that they are rich and
increased with goods, and have need of nothing, when indeed (in their
spiritual estate) they are wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked:
Wherefore the Spirit Ver. 17.
counsels them to buy of him gold tried in the fire, that they may be rich;
and white raiment, that they may be clothed, and that the shame of their
nakedness do not appear: And, to anoint their eyes with Ver. 18.
eye salve, that they may see.

7. Lastly, by the name Thyatira, so called, (...), signifying to run mad
after, and spend ones self, they may be put in mind of those in Thyatira,
who ran awhoring after Jezebel, and spent their estates upon her, and
committed filthiness with her: Cap. 2. Ver. 20.
which because the Angel winked at, the Spirit sharply reproves him.

And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira, write, I know thy works, etc.
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, etc. These Verses resemble
the branches of the Apoc. 22.2.
tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits.

1. The first I gather from them is the dignity of the Ministers of the Gospel,
to whom the Son of God writes, stiling them Angels. To the Angel of Ephesus,
of Smyrna, etc.

2. The second, the difference of degrees in the Ministry: for the Son of God
endorseth his letter not to the inferior Ministers, which were many in each of
these Churches, but to the Angel, in the singular number, the Bishop or
Super-intendent of the place, to whom the government of the Church, and
ordering Ecclesiastical affairs chiefly, if not only, appertained.

3. The third is the glorious majesty and divinity of our Savior, who was
before styled the Son of man, but is here called the Son of God, and
described with eyes like a flame of fire, piercing through the thickest
darkness; and with feet like fine brass, walking through the midst of all the
Churches, and yet no way defiled, according to the words of the Prophet, the
Hos. 14.9.
ways of the Lord are undefiled.

4. The fourth is mildness in just reproof: the physician of our souls, who
has cured all our wounds with the smart of his, prescribes the weak Angel of
Thyatira but one pill, and that a gentle one; yet see how he rowles it in
sugar; I know thy works, and thy love, etc. Of many faults he mentions but a
few, and of those few insisteth but upon one.

5. The fifth is the condition of good works, to which four things are
required; faith, love, service, and patience: they must be done in faith,
proceed from the love of God, with a desire to do him service thereby; and
lastly, the performers of them must be constant in them, and resolve patiently
to endure all crosses and oppositions from men or Satan, who seek to stay them
in their godly proceedings.

6. The sixth is growth in grace, or proficiency in godliness: those who were
ever good are best at the last; I know thy works, that they are more as the
last than at the first.

7. The seventh is the state and condition of the Church Militant, which at the
best is like the Moon at the full, in which we may discern some black
spots. The sweetest Eras. Adag. Omnibus malis punicis putridum granum inest.
Pomegranet has some rotten grain, the fairest beauty has a freckle or
wrinckle, the most orient Ruby a cloud, and the most reformed Church in the
Christian world has some deformity in her: In James 3.1.
many things we offend all, and many in all: they are but a few against whom
the Son of God has but a few things. Notwithstanding I have a few things.

8. The eighth is the duty of a Magistrate, who like a good Gardener is to
pluck up noisome weeds by the roots. It is not sufficient for him to do no
evil; he must not suffer it: the Angel is not here blamed for any sin of
commission or omission in himself, but for the bare permission of evil in
others: I have somewhat against thee, because thou suffer.

9. The ninth is a caution to look to the weaker sex: for often the Devil
makes of them strong instruments, to dispread the poison of heresy. Hieron.
ad Ctes. Simon Magus heresin condidit Helenae meretricis adjutus auxilio;
Nicolaus Antiochenus omnium immunditiarum repertor, choros duxit foemineos,
Marcion Romam praemisit mulierem, quae decipiendos sibi animos praepararet.
Simon Magus had his Helena, Marcion his femall forerunner, Apelles his
Philumena, Montanus his Maximilla, Donatus his Lucillia, Elpidius his Agape,
Priscillian his Galla, Arius the Prince his sister, Nicolaus Antiochenus his
feminine troops and quires, and all Arch-heretickes some strumpets or other,
to serve them for midwives when they were in travel with monstrous and
misshapen heresies: Thou suffer the woman Jezebel. Yet to do the sex right,
I willingly acknowledge with Flacius Illyricus, that as the Devil has used
bad women in all times, as Brokers to utter his deceitful and dangerous wares;
so God has made choice of many good women, to be conduits of saving grace, and
great instruments of his glory. Not to go out of this City of Thyatira for
instance, we can produce a Lydia for a Jezebel; where the Devil now vented
poison by the impure mouth of Jezebel, God poured out before the sweet ointment
of the Gospel by the mouth of Lydia, whose Acts 16.14.
heart he opened, that she attended to those things which were spoken of Paul.

10. The tenth is an observation concerning the nature of Heresy, which
fretteth like a canker; and if it be not looked to, corrupts the sound
members of Christ: Thou suffer the woman Jezebel to seduce my servants.

11. The eleventh is a consideration of the odious filthiness of Idolatry,
which the Scripture terms the souls naughtiness, and spiritual
fornication: To commit fornication.

12. The last is a wholesome doctrine concerning the contagion of Idolatry,
which not only infecteth our bodies and souls, but our meats and drinks
also, and turns the food of the body into the poison of the soul to such as
familiarly converse and table with Idolaters, and feed upon the relics of
Idols sacrifices: And to eat things offered unto Idols.

And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira. Glorious things are spoken of you,
O ye Ministers of the Word and Sacraments: Ye are styled Ambassadors of the
King of Heaven, Stewards of the household of faith, Interpreters of the Oracles
of God, Dispensers of the mysteries of salvation, Keepers of the Seals of
grace: Ye are the Salt of the earth, the Light of the world, the Stars of
the sky, nay, the Angels of Heaven: To the Angel. The Ministers of the Gospel
resemble Angels in many things:

1. Angels are Heb. 1.14.
ministering spirits, and the Preachers of the Gospel are spiritual Ministers.

2. Angels, according to the derivation of their name in Greek, are Matthew.
11.10. Malac. 3.1.
messengers of God, and the Ministers of the Gospel are 1 John 1.5.
messengers of Christ.

3. The dwelling of Angels is in Heaven, and there is or ought to be the Phil.
3.20. Our conversation is in heaven.
conversation of the Ministers of the Gospel.

4. The life of Angels is a continual Matthew. 18.10
beholding the face of God; and what is the life of a good Minister, but a
continual contemplation of the divine nature, attributes and works?

5. The Angels gather Mat. 24.31.
the Elect from the four winds, and the Ministers of the Gospel gather the
Church from all corners of the earth.

6. The Angels Apoc. 16.1.
pour out the vialls of the wrath of God upon the earth, and the Ministers are
appointed to denounce Gods judgments and plagues to the wicked world.

7. The Angels 1 Cor. 15 52.
sound Trumpets at the last resurrection, and the Ministers of the Gospel at
the first.

8. When Christ was in an agony, Luke 22.43.
there appeared an Angel strengthening him; and when Gods children are in
greatest extremity, God sends the Ministers of the Gospel to Job 33.23. If
there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show
to man his uprightness, etc.
comfort them.

9. The Angels carry the souls of them that dye in the Lord into Abraham's
bosom (Luke 16.22.) and the Ministers of the Gospel give them their pass, and
furnish them with their last viaticum.

Now, if it be demanded why God so highly advances the dignity of the
Ministry; I answer, to advance his glory: He lifts up the silver Trumpets of
Sion on high, that the sound of his praise may be heard the further. As the
visible Sun casts a more radiant and bright beam upon Pearl and Glass,
which reflecteth them again, than upon gross and obscure bodies that dead the
rays thereof; even so the Sun of righteousness casts the fairest luster
upon that calling, which most of all illustrateth his glory. To other vocations
God calls us, but this calls us unto God: all other lawful callings are of
God, but of this God himself was: and if it be a great honor to the noblest
orders of Knighthood on earth, to have Kings and Princes installed into them;
how can we think too worthily of that sacred order, into which the Son of
God was solemnly invested by his Psalm. 110.4.
Father? I speak nothing to impeach the dignity of any lawful profession;
make much of the Physicians of your body, yet not more than of the Physicians
of your soul: yield honor and due respect to those that are skillful in the
civil and municipall Laws; yet under-value them not, who expound unto you the
Laws of God. At least take not pride in disgracing them, who are Gods
instruments to conveigh grace into your souls: grieve not them with your
accursed speeches, who daily bless you: load them not with slanders and
calumnies, who by their absolution and ghostly comfort ease you of the heavy
burden of your sins: go not about to thrust them out of their temporal
estate, who labor by their Ministry to procure you an eternal. It is not
desire of popular applause, or a sinister respect to our own profit, but the
zeal of Gods glory, which extorteth from us these and the like complaints
against you. For if Religion might be advanced by our fall, and the Gospel
gain by our losses, and God get glory by our dis-esteeme, we should desire
nothing rather than to be accounted the offscouring of all things on the
earth, that so we might shine hereafter like precious stones in the foundation
of the celestial Jerusalem. But if the Preachers and the Gospel, the Word and
Sacraments, and the Ministers thereof: Religion and Priests, the Church and
Churchmen are so near allies, that the dis-reputation of the one, is a great
prejudice to the other, and the disgrace of the one, the despising of the
other; if the truth we profess, if our Religion, if the Gospel, if Christ, if
God suffer in the disgraces that are put upon our calling, and the manifold
wrongs that are done to it, we must adjure you for your own good, and deeply
charge you in Gods cause, that as you look to receive any good from him, so
you take nothing sacrilegiously from the Church; as you hope to be saved by the
Ministry, preserve the dignity and estimation thereof; be not cursed Chams in
discovering the nakedness of your ghostly fathers. Alexander thought that he
could not lay too much cost upon the deske, in which Homers Poems lay; and we
daily see how those who take delight in music, beautify and adorn the
instrument they play upon with varnish, purfle, gilt painting, and rich lace:
in like manner, if you were so affected as you should be at the hearing of the
Word, if you were ravished with the sweet strains of the songs of Sion, ye
would make better reckoning of the Instruments and Organs of the holy Spirit,
by which God makes melody in your hearts: ye would not stain with impure
breath the silver trumpets of Sion, blown not with wind, but with the breath
of God himself: ye would not trample under foot those Canes that yield you
such store of Sugar, or rather of Manna.

Ye will be apt enough, upon these and the like texts, to teach us our duty,
that we ought, as Messengers of God, to deliver his message faithfully, and as
near as we can in his own words; as Angels to give our selves to divine
contemplation, and endeavor to frame our lives to a heavenly conversation. Let
it not then be offensive to you to hear your duty, which is as plain to be
read as ours, in the style here attributed to the Pastor of Laodicea, the
Angel. It is that you entertain your diligent and faithful Pastors, as the
Gal. 4.14. Ye received me as an Angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
Galathians did St. Paul, and as Monica did St. Ambrose, tanquam Angelos Dei,
as the Angels of God; receive them as Abraham and Lot did the Angels sent from
God unto them, defend them according to your power from wrong, and make them
partakers of the best things wherewith God has blessed you.

Angelo, to the Angel, in the singular number, chief Pastor or Bishop of the
Church. All Ministers, as I showed you before, may challenge the title of
Angels; but especially Bishops, who watch over other Ministers, as Angels over
men; who are to order the affairs of the Church, and govern the Clergy, as
the Peripatetickes teach, that Angels direct and govern the motions of the
celestial spheres: therefore Epiphanius, and St. Austine, and most of the
later Interpreters also, paraphrase Angelo by Episcopo illic constituto: and
verily the manner of the superscription, and the contents of the letter, and
the form of government settled in all Churches at this time, make for this
interpretation. For supposing more Ministers in London of equal rank and
dignity as there are, who would indorse a letter on this manner, To the
Pastor of London, unless he meant the Bishop or chief Pastor? Now it is
evident out of the twentieth chapter of the Acts, ver. 17. and all ancient
stories, that there were diverse Ministers or Presbyters in each of these seven
Churches: He therefore, to whom the letter was addressed in particular, to the
Angel, could be no other than the Bishop or Superintendent of the place; who is
here blamed for suffering Jezebel to teach: which shows that he had
Episcopal power and authority to silence and suspend her, or any other
erroneous Teacher within his Diocese. What should I add out of Lib. 3. c. 3.
Irenaeus; Polycarpus ab Apostolis in ea quae est Smyrnae Ecclesia constitutus
est Episcopus, quem nos vidimus in prima aetate nostra; that the Angel of
Smyrna was Bishop Polycarpus, ordained by the Apostles themselves, whom he
himself saw in his younger years: Or out of In ep. ad Tit. l. 1. Toto orb
decretum est, ut unus Presbyterelectus superponeretur caeteris, ad quem omnis
Ecclesiae cura pertineret.
Jerome, that to prevent schisms among Presbyters and Priests, Episcopal
government was established through the whole world?

And let this suffice to be spoken of the office of this Angel: we will now
consider of his charge, or that wherewith the Holy Ghost here burdeneth him,
the toleration of heresy and idolatry. I have a few things against thee,

That thou suffer. Variam and miscellaneam Religionem induxerunt sceptro
tuendo, ne unquam conspirare interse omnes possint.
Diodorus Siculus reports that the ancient Kings of Egypt made a kind of
medley of religion to serve their turn, that the people might thereby be
distracted, and so disabled from attempting any thing against the State. And we
read likewise in Ecclesiast. hist. l. 4. c. 27.
Socrates, of Themistius, that he labored to persuade Valens the Emperor,
that God was well pleased with variety of sects, dum it a pluribus modis
colitur, because by this toleration of diverse religions God is worshipped after
diverse manners. And Father Parsons, with whom Lib. 3. de rep. c. 7.
Bodine the great Statesman of France, and Cardinal In Apolog.
Allen, and William In his answer to the reformed Catholic.
Bishop, Seminary Priest, join hearts and pens, spending the strength of
their wit, and flower of their learning in this argument of toleration; taking
upon them to prove, first, in Thesi, that Religions, differing in substantial
points, and fundamental grounds, are comportable in the same Kingdom: and in
Hypothesi, that it is not only lawful and expedient, but also honorable for
the King of Great Britain to permit the public profession and practice of
the Romish Religion within his Kingdoms. For the proof of their Thesis they
allege but one text of Scripture, and that miserably wrested: Mat. 13.30.
Sinite utraque crescere in messem, let both grow until the harvest.

The great want of Scriptures they strive in some sort to supply by conjectures
of reason, and examples of foreign States: but the fairest gloss they set
upon their foul assertion, is from such plausible sentences of the ancient
Fathers as these: Lactan l. 5. divin. institut. c. 14. and 20. Quis tam
insolens, tam elatus est, qui me vetet oculos in coelum tollere? quis imponat
mihi necessitatem vel colendi quod nolim, vel non colendi quod velim? Nihil est
tam voluntarium quam Religio, in qua si animus sacrificantis est aversus, jam
sublata est, jam nulla est.
Who is so proud as to forbid me to lift up my eyes to heaven? Who will impose
a necessity upon me, either to worship that which I will not, or not to worship
what I will? Nothing so much depends on the will as Religion, which is not
Religion but Hypocrisy if the mind be averse from it. Tertul. ad Scapulam c.
2. Nec religionis est religionem cogere.
It is against Religion to enforce Religion, and constrain men to dissemble
with God. Verily the chiefest point of Religion consists in the inward
sacrifice of the heart, and devotion of the will: and how is it possible to
devote our Bernard. in Cant. Fides suadenda, non imponend^.
will against our will? This reason against forcing Religion seemed so forcible
to Theodoricus, that he forbad all Inquisitions and Tortures in case of
Religion. For other things (says he) we may, Religion we cannot command.
Neither was he singular in this his opinion: for upon the like grounds to his,
Theodosius and Leo, Catholic Emperors, permitted Churches to the Arrian
Heretics; as likewise Constantius and Valentinian, Arrian Heretics, granted
Oratories to Catholic Bishops. The Emperors of Germany tolerate Lutherans
and Zuinglians, the French King Hugonots, the Grand-Seignior Christians, the
Pope Jews in Rome; whereunto Bodin adds the example of the ancient Aug. l.
18. de Civit. Dei. Roma, cum omnibus pene gentibus dominaretur, omnium pene
gentium survivit erroribus.
Romans, who permitted the free use of their Religion to all the Nations they
conquered: and of the Emperor Alexander Severus, who kept in his closet the
pictures of Abraham, Orpheus, Hercules and Christ, and privily worshipped them
all.

These are the fairest pretenses, and plausiblest arguments for toleration. How
few in number? how light in weight? how easy and short in the answer?

First, for their text of Scripture (let both grow to the harvest) which Doctor
Bishop sets in the forefront of his discourse. Can any man of learning and
judgment once dream, that our Lords meaning was thereby to inhibite all
proceedings against Heretics and wicked livers? to enjoyne all Magistrates to
suffer virtue and vice, truth and heresy to grow together in the Church till
the harvest, that is, the end of the world? Could Doctor Bishop or any other
Papist persuade himself that our Savior commands that to be done, for which
he here blames the Angel of Mat. 13.30.
Thyatira, and before the Angel of Ver. 14.
Pergamus? Do not all Papists defend the Inquisition in Spain and Italy, and
the Pope their Master his proceedings against Protestants, under the name of
Heretics? Certainly if Christ in this parable absolutely commands a
toleration of Heretics and Schismatikes, under the name of tares, the Popish
Inquisition is a transgression of Christ's command, by their own inference from
it: which if any Papist maintain, he will not be long out of the Inquisition:
if he trust not to his heels he shall feel the gag soon in his mouth, and
assay the Sea the book of the Spanish Inquisition, and in it the form of this
bridle.
man-bridle.

As for the meaning of the place of Scripture, it is clear in it self, and
has been long ago by the Ancients declared to be this, that God suffers
hypocrites and dissemblers to mingle themselves with godly Professors in the
visible Church, whom because we cannot sufficiently discern and distinguish,
who know not the hearts of men, he forbids us to attempt an universal and
utter extirpation of them, in this respect only, ne simul eradicemus triticum,
lest together with cockle and darnell, or in stead thereof, we pluck up good
wheat. What makes this for the toleration of open Idolatours, and known
Heretics, or scandalous livers, who if they be not weeded out by execution of
penal Statutes or Ecclesiastical censures, will hinder the growth of all
virtue and Religion? Wherefore the case being so clear, that this text of
Scripture is shamefully wrested by the Adversary, I leave the Patrons of
toleration to be disciplined by the Jesuit Mald. in hunc loc. Abutuntur hoc
loco ut probent aut non puniendos aut non occidendos haereticos.
Maldonat, who in his Comment upon this text, strikes them smartly with his
feruler that abuse this place (as he says) to prove that Heretics are not at
all to be punished, or not to be punished with death.

I come to the ancient Fathers, who indeed justly tax the heathen for folly
and cruelty, in forcing their idolatrous worship upon Christians by the sword,
which they were never able, nor so much as once offered to maintain by
argument. Against all such, who terrify and teach not, as St. Austine
speaks, or begin with fire and faggot, or have no sharper weapons to defend
the truth of their Religion than the edge of the axe, or point of the sword,
Lactantius and Tertullians exceptions are just, and their admonitions
seasonable. Lact. divin. instit. l. 5. c. 20. Verbis potius quam verberibus res
agenda est ut sit voluntas: distringant aciem ingeniorum suorum; si ratio eorum
vera est, afferatur, parati sumus au dire; doceant, tacentibus certe nihil
credimus, sicut nec sae vientibus quidem cedimus.
Let the heathen draw the sword of their wits, and try it at the point of
argument. They dislike not, after gentle remedies have proved uneffectuall, to
use severitie against obstinate Heretics. For though Saint Bernard says
truly, Fides suadenda, non imponenda; faith is to be persuaded, not to be
imposed upon a man: yet Tertullian affirms as truly in another case,
Contumacie is to be dealt roughly withal, durities vincenda est, non suadenda,
obstinacy is to be compelled, not persuaded.

Yea, but faith is the gift of God, and cannot be forced upon a man against his
will. Neither can any moral virtue: and yet Drunkards, and Incontinent
persons, and Thieves, and Murderers, are justly punished. And why not as well
Miscreants, Idolatours, and Heretics? Faith indeed is the gift of God, yet he
neither gives it, nor preserves it in us without means, whereof one of the
chief is the strict execution of Ecclesiastical discipline, and Imperial
laws, whereby all the Diocese of Aug. ep. 48. Hippo cum tota esset in part
Donati, ad unitatem catholicam timore legum imperialium conversa est.
Hippo was reclaimed from the heresy of the Donatists: Religion Lactan. loc.
sup cit. Non est opus vi and injuria, quia Religio cogi non potest.
cannot be enforced. It is a true proposition, if it be rightly understood, but
no way makes for toleration of error, or against wholesome laws, for the
preservation of the purity of Religion. For the acts of Religion are of two
sorts:

1 Inward, as belief and affiance in God, hope and charity.

2 Outward, as to go to Church to hear Sermons, to be present at the
administering of the Sacraments, to make open profession of our faith by word of
mouth, or writing: to these men may be compelled by penal Statutes. Health
cannot be forced upon a sick man, yet his mouth may be violently opened with a
spoone, and that cordial water powered down his throat, which may be a good
means under God to recover his health. To this purpose Saint Austine speaks
Epist. 48. Utrisque molestus est, utrosque tamen amat.
appositely: He that by a smart blow rowseth a man in a Lethargy, or by maine
force binds a mad man, is troublesome to both, yet does a good office to both.

Yea, but is it not cruelty to trouble men or women for their conscience? to
compel people by violent means, to communicate with that service which in
their heart they abhor? supposing it to be the true worship of God to which
the State compels (though they that are forced to it deem otherwise) to
enforce them in this case to it, is no persecution at all, but execution rather
of Gods Law: or, if they will needs have it termed a persecution, I distinguish
with Saint Aug ep. 50. Est persecutio justa quam facit impiis Ecclesia, and est
persecutio injusta quam faciunt impii Eccl^siae: and ep. 48. ^lane semper and
mali persecuti sunt bonos, and boni malos; illi nocendo per injustitiam, hi
consulendo per disciplinam, illi immaniter, isti temperanter, illi persequuntur
sanitatem, hi putredinem.
Austine of a double persecution.

1. A just, which the Church of God raises against the wicked for their
impieties.

2. Unjust, which the wicked, when they are in place, raise against the godly
for the truths sake.

The former proceeds from love and zeal, and intends instruction; the later
from malice and cruelty, and intends destruction: the one wounds by injustice,
the other heales by discipline; that lets out the corrupt, this spills the life
blood. Now for the examples of toleration of diverse Religions, they are either
in such places where there are diverse Regiments and Soveraignties; as in
Germany, where each Prince maintains that Religion which he is persuaded in his
conscience to be the right: or of Princes which could do no other, as things
then stood with them; as Theodosius, who for a while bare with the Arrians, but
as soon as he had strength enough against them, prohibited them all meetings,
deprived them of the benefit of making Wills, and forbad all disputing about
the equality of the persons in the Trinity, as we may read in Sozomen and
Theodoret: or they are of Heretics, Turks and Infidels, and so no good
presidents for Orthodoxe Christians. In brief, they are all either impertinent
or inconsequent, and are over-borne with stronger reasons, and more
uncontrollable authorities on the contrary; which before I martial in their
order, I will set down certain distinctions and cautions for the clearer
manifestation of the truth.

1. First, by diverse Religions, we understand Religions differing in main
grounds and substantial points of faith, not in the outward form of
discipline, much less in the habit or furniture of Rites and Ceremonies only.
Diversities of Rites and Ceremonies have been always in the Catholic Church
without breach of unity. The Spouse of Christ wears a garment wrought about
with diverse colors: And the Musicians will tell us, that some discords in a
lesson, binding wise (as they speak) and falling into a concord, much grace
the music.

2. Secondly, we wish that all Magistrates Ecclesiastical and Civil, would
first make proof of gentler remedies, and seek rather to win men by
persuasions, than draw them to Church by compulsion; Monendo potius quam
minando, and verbis magis quam verberibus, to use rather commonitions than
comminations, words than blows, discourses than legal courses, arguments than
torments.

3. Thirdly, in making and executing penal Statutes against Heretics and
Idolaters, all Christian Princes and States must wash their hands from blood,
and free themselves from all aspersion of cruelty. For no fish will come into
the net which they see all bloody: and they who are too quick in plucking at
those that differ from them in Religion, root up those oft-times for tares,
which if they had been permitted longer to grow, might have proved good corn.

4. Fourthly, they must put a great difference between those that are infected
with Heretical opinions, whereof some are ringleaders, some are followers,
some are obstinate, others flexible, some are turbulent, others peaceable; on
some they ought to have Jude 22, 23.
compassion, making a difference; and others save with fear, pulling them out
of the fire.

5. Lastly, nothing must be done herein by the intemperate zeal of the heady
multitude, or any private motion; but after mature advice and deliberation be
appointed by lawful authority.

To the particular instances brought from our neighbor Nations that are
repugnant to this rule, we answer with Saint Sermon. 66. in Cant. Approbamus
zelum, factum non laudamus.
Bernard: We approve their zeal, yet we allow not of their proceedings.

These cautions observed, that religions differing in fundamental grounds are
not to be tolerated in the same Kingdom, we prove

1. First, by the Law of Deuteronomy. 22.10, 11.
Moses, which forbids plowing with an Ox and an Ass together: or, to wear
a garment of diverse sorts, as of woollen and linen together. The moral of
which Law, according to the interpretation of the best Expositors, has a
reference to diversities in Religions, and making a kind of medley of diverse
worships of God.

2. Secondly, by the grievous punishment of Idolaters appointed by God himself:
Deuteronomy. 13.6, 8, 9.
If thy brother, or son of thy mother, or thine own son, or thy daughter, or
the wife that lies in thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul,
entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, thine eye shall
not pity him, neither shall thou keep him secret, but thine hand shall be upon
him, and then the hand of all the people to stone him to death: Solum pietatis
genus est hic esse crudelem, It is piety in this kind to show no pity. It is
not in the power of Kings and Princes to reverse the decrees of Almighty God,
or falsify his Oracles, who says, No Matthew. 6.24.
man can serve two masters. For what fellowship has righteousness with
unrighteousness? and what 2 Cor. 6.14, 15, 16.
communion has light with darkness? or what concord has Christ with Belial?
and what agreement has the Temple of God with Idols?

3. Thirdly, if these testimonies of everlasting truth persuade us not, that
God, who is truth, must be worshipped in truth, and not with lies, and in a
false manner; yet Christ his inditing the Angel of Thyatira for suffering
Jezebel, and the Angel of Pergamus for not silencing false Teachers: I have a
few things against thee (says the Spirit) that thou have there them that
maintain the doctrine of Baalam. The Spirit charge not the Angel with
allowing or countenancing, but tolerating only false doctrine: Therefore the
toleration of Heresy and Idolatry is a sin which God will not tolerate in a
Magistrate; which I further thus demonstrate:

4. Fourthly, God will not hold any Prince or State guiltless, which
permits a pollution of his name; but the worship of a false god, or the
false worship of the true God, is a pollution of his name, as himself
declares: Ezekiel. 20.39.
Pollute my name no more with your gifts and your Idols. God is a jealous God,
and will endure no corrivall; if we divide our heart between him and any
other, he will cut us off from the land of the living, as he threatens: I
Zeph. 1.5.
will cut off the remnant of Baal, and them that worship the host of Heaven
upon the house tops, and them that worship and swear by the Lord, and by
Malcham.

5. Fifthly, what shall I add hereunto save this, that the bare permission of
Idolatry was such a blurre to Solomon, and most of the succeeding Kings of
Juda, that it obscured the luster, and marred the gloss of all their other
Princely endowments? For after the description of their virtues, this blot is
cast upon their reputation; But the high 1 Kin. 15.14.
places were not taken away. But thrice happy 2 Kin. 18.4.
Hezekiah, who by demolishing the brazen Serpent which Moses had made (because
the children of Israel burned incense to it) erected to himself an everlasting
monument of praise. And yet more happy 2 Kin. 23.25.
Josiah, after whom the Holy Ghost sends this testimony: Like unto him there
was no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with
all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses,
neither after him arose there any like unto him. Why? what eminent virtues had
Josiah above others? what noble acts did he, which the Spirit values at so high
a rate? no other than those which we find recounted in the books of Kings and
Chronicles: He brake down the Altars of Baalim, and cut down the Images that
were on high upon them, he brake also the groves and the carved Images, and
the molten 2 Chronicles. 34.4, 5.
Images, and stamped them to powder, and strewed it upon the graves of them
that sacrificed to them; and he burned the bones of the Priests upon the
Altar. He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom,
that no man might make 2 Kin. 23.10, 11, 12, 13.
his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Moloch: and he took away
the horses that the Kings of Judah had given to the Sun, and the Altars that
were on the top of the upper chambers of Ahaz, and the Altars which Manasseh
had made in the two Courts of the house of the Lord, and the high places that
were before Jerusalem, which Solomon had builded, and so he took away all the
abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel,
and 2 Chro. 34.33.
compelled all that were found in Israel to serve the Lord their God.

6. Sixthly, farther to teach Magistrates, that they ought sometimes to use
violent and compulsive means, to bring men to the true service of God; our
Savior delivers a Parable of a certain Luke 14.16.
man that made a great Supper, and when the guests that were bid came not in,
the Master said to his servants, Ver. 23.
Go to the high ways and hedges, to compel them to come in, that my house
may be filled. On which ground St. In hunc. loc. Non quia cogantur
reprehendant, sed quo cogantur attendant.
Austine thus descanteth, What are the hedges here meant, but schisms and
heresies, that make partitions and separations in the house of God? from which
when the sheep of Christ are pulled, let them not find fault because they are
haled, but look whither they are haled, into Christ's sheepfold. A prudent
advice, and seriously to be thought upon by all that murmr and repine at the
Church and States proceedings against obstinate Recusants, be they Papists or
Brownists: they could not mislike that they are compelled, if they entered into
a serious consideration whither they are compelled to go, to wit, to a
marriage Supper, to partake of the Manna of the Word and Sacraments. O happy
violence, that pulls men out of hell fire, happy bonds that tie us to Christ's
body, happy fetters that hold our feet in the way of peace, happy scourges and
whips that drive us into heaven, happy outward compulsion that works inward
compunction!

7 Seventhly, to these constraining arguments for compulsories against
refractarie persons, we may add infinite examples of zealous Princes, to
counterpoize all the presidents brought before for connivencie at schism or
heresy. I spoke but even now of Josiah and Hezekiah, after whom may be ranked
2 Chr. 15.16. And all the people swear unto the Lord with a loud voice, with
shouting, trumpets, and cornets, that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of
Israel should be slain.
Asa, who deposed Maacath his mother from her Regencie, because she had made an
Idol in a grove, which he brake down, and stamped to powder. And
Nebuchadnezzar made a Decree, That every people, nation and language, which
spoke any blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Misach, and Abednego, should
be drawn in pieces, and their houses made a jakes, Dan. 3.29. And that I may
join Ecclesiastical stories with the inspired, I will relate some
constitutions of the best Emperors which swayed the Roman Scepter. Eusebius. in
vit. Constant.
Constantine the Great appointed that all the Temples of Heretics should be
pulled down, and that it should not be lawful for them to assemble together
in public or private. And that Theodosius and later Emperors were as quick
against them, it appears by the Code of Justinian; Lib. 1. tit. 5. Omnes
vetitae legibus divinis, and imperialibus constitutionibus haereses perpetuo
conticescant
Let all heresies, forbidden by the law of God and Imperial sanctions, keep
silence for ever. And again, Tit. cunc. Cuncti haeretici procul dubio noverint
omnia sibi loca adimenda esse.
Let all Heretics understand, that all places of meeting, as well Churches as
private houses, are to be taken away from them: let them be debarred from all
service day and night, the Lord Deputy to be fined a hundredth pound if he
permit any such thing. Will you hear yet sharper laws? Peruse the chapter of
Manicheos. Manicheos meritissima severitate persequimur, ac primum volumus
publicum esse crimen, quia quod in religionem divinam committitur, in omnium
fertur injuriam: and in eos severitatis nostrae aculei erigantur, qui eos
domibus suis damnanda provisione defendunt.
We prosecute the Manichees with most deserved severitie; and first we
determine that this heresy shall be held a public crime: because that which
derogateth from the true worship of God, cannot but be many ways prejudicial
to the State. These Manichees therefore we punish with confiscation of goods,
we debar them from buying or selling, bequeathing goods or lands by will or
otherwise, from recovering any legacies, or enjoying their fathers inheritance:
and let them all be liable to the same penalties who keep and foster such
persons in their houses.

8 Eighthly, for the mitigation of which laws, when the Heretics expected
that S. Austine should mediate with the Emperor, he falls thus foul upon them:
Yes forsooth, what else? I shall gainesay the constitution of the Emperor, and
interc^de that you lose not the things which you call yours, and you without
fear spoil Christ of that which is his? A reasonable demand, is it not? that
the Roman laws should permit you to make your last will and testament, whilst
you with cavelling and sophistry go about to frustrate Gods last will and
Testament? that in buying and selling your contracts may be good, and you the
whilst share among you that which Christ bought when he was sold? that you be
not banished from the place of your abode, when you, as much as in you lies,
drive Christ from the Kingdom purchased with his blood? Tertullian is as
peremptory in this point: Scorpiacum c. 2. Ad officium haereticos compelli, non
illici dignum; du^^tia vincenda est non suadenda: and utique satis optimum
prae^udicatur quod probabitur a Deo constitutum.
We must deal roundly with Heretics, and overcome their obstinacy by more
powerful Rhetorike than persuasive speeches. For that course must be thought
the best which God himself has taken. St. Cypr. ep. 6.
Cyprian points to those texts of Scripture, wherein God allows of, yea,
and expressly commands severe proceedings against Heretics and Idolatours:
with whom St. Greg. com. in Cant.
Gregory accords in his note upon those words, Catch the foxes that spoil the
vines. Of the same mind are Hier. in Cr^s. Leo. ep. 93.
Hierome, Leo, and the Synod of Burdigala, who all approve of Maximus his
proceedings against the Heretic Priscillian; and Epiphanius and Cyrill, who,
to strike a terror in the hearts of Heretics, relate the fleaing of Manes,
the father of the Manichees, by the King of Persia. To fill up the rank: Lib.
3. cont. Parm.
Optatus likeneth Macarius to Phineas and Elias, for making a quick dispatch
with the Heretics of his time. Dioscorus Alexandrinus cries out in the Synod
of Chalcedon, that Heresy is to be purged with fire, Haereticos flamma dignos.
Clemens Alexandrinus wishes all happiness to the Scythian King, who hung a
Citizen, and after commanded him to be shot through with arrows, for
sacrificing to the mother of the gods, after the manner of the Grecians. Ep. ad
Ser. Procul dubio melius esset ut gladio coercerentur illius, qui sine causa
gladium non gestat.
Lastly, St. Bernard, after he had made mention of some private persons, who
ran upon blasphemous Heretics, and tare them in pieces for rending the
Church, interposeth his own judgment in this manner; They should have done
better, to have delivered up those blasphemous Heretics into the hands of the
Magistrate, who bears not the sword of justice in vain.

9 Ninthly, if these pious resolutions of the ancient Fathers, and noble acts
of religious Princes, serve not as matches to kindle the zeal of godly
Magistrates against the enemies of our Religion, the heathen shall one day rise
up against them; the ancient Romans, who had this law written among the rest,
Leg. 12. tab. Deos privatos nemo habeat.
Let no man have a private Religion to himself: the Athenians, who banished
Protagoras for that atheistical speech of his, de diis, Sintne, an non sint,
nil habeo dicere; I can say nothing concerning the gods, whether there are any,
or not; and put Socrates to death Plato in apolog. Socr. (...).
because he made question of the truth of that Religion which the State
professed. In a word, all nations of the world shall condemn them, of whom
Seneca sent. Violatarum religionum apud diversas gentes diversa statuitur
poena, apud omnes aliquo.
Seneca writes truly, that for the profaning, violating, or corrupting the
worship of God there are diverse punishments appointed in diverse places, but in
all Countries some or other. And not without cause: for if it be a scandal to
a State to suffer thieves and murderers to go unpunished, are Heretics to be
set free, who rob men of that pearl of truth which the rich merchant man sold
all that he had to buy? who are guilty of spiritual homicide? wherewith St.
Tract. 11. in Johan. Videtis qualia faciant, and qu^lia patiuntur; occidunt
animas, affliguntur in corpore, sempiternas mortes faciunt, and temporales se
perpeti conqueruntur.
Austine directly charge them; You see what these miscreants do, and what
they suffer; and have they, think you, any just cause to complain of the
punishments that are inflicted on them? They kill the souls of men, and smart
for it in their bodies: by their damnable doctrine they bring men to eternal
death, and yet grudge that they suffer a temporal. Do not all wise men
account Religion to be the foundation which bears up the whole frame and
fabric of State? And is it possible a building should stand upon two
foundations? Religion is the soul which animateth the great body of the
Commonwealth, and will it not prove a monster if it be informed with diverse
souls? The Church and Commonwealth have but one center; any new motion
therefore in the one must needs make a commotion in the other. In which regard
Mecoenas advised Augustus to punish severely all Innovators in matter of
Religion, Non solum deorum causa, sed quia nova quaedam numina hi tales
inducentes, multos impellunt ad rerum mutationem.
not only out of a regard of piety, but also for reason of State. What
mutinies, what heart-burnings, what jealousies, what bloody frayes and
massacres may there be feared, where Religion sets an edge upon discontent?
And all that dye in these quarrels pretend to the Crown of Martyrdom. I
forbear multiplicity of examples in this kind, our neighbor Countries have
bin for many years the stages whereon these tragedies for Religion have been
acted, and God alone knows what the catastrophe will be. There was never so
great mischief done at Rome by fire, as when it took the Temple of Vesta, and
mingled it self with the sacred flame. Ovi. fast. l. 6.
Ardebant sancti sceleratis ignibus ignes,
Et mista est flammae flamma prophana piae.
Even so if the wildfire of contention mix it self with the sacred fire of
zeal, and both burn within the bowels of the same Church, it is not a river
of blood that is like to quench the direful flame. Therefore Ep. 166. Julianus
reddidit Basilicas haereticis quando templa Demonus, eo modo putans Christianum
nomen posse petire de te^^^s, si unitati Ecclesiae, de qua lapsus fuerat,
invideret, and sacrileg^s di^^^nsiones liberas esse p^rmitteret.
Julian the Apostata, as S. Austine reports, having a desire to set all
Christendom in a combustion, cast a fire-ball of contention among them, by
proclaiming liberty to all Heretics and Schismatickes to set abroach their
damnable doctrines, hoping thereby utterly to extinguish the name of Christians.

But to come near to our Adversaries, and turn their own ordnance upon them:
Did Queen Mary in her short reign exempt the servants of God of any age or
sex from the merciless flames of the fire? Do not Bellarmine, Allan,
Parsons, Pammelius, Maldonat, and generally all Jesuits, set their wits upon
the rack, and stretch and torture them, to maintain the rackes and tortures of
Popish Inquisition? Of what hard metal then are their foreheads made, who dare
supplicate for a toleration in a Protestant state, able to suppress them? Why
should they not be contented with their own measure, though all the world
knows the sweet benignity and clemency of our gracious Sovereign abates them
more than the half? Here me thinks I hear the souls of the slain under the
Altar cry. How long Lord, holy and just, do not thou revenge the blood of thy
servants spilt as water upon the ground by the Whore of Babylon, which to this
day out-braveth thy Spouse, having dyed her garments scarlet red in the goare
of thy Saints, and Martyrs of thy Son Jesus Christ? Righteous Lord, we have
been made a spectacle of misery to Angels and men, we have been killed all the
day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter; we have been spoiled of
all our goods, banished our native soil; we have been hewn asunder, we have
been slain with a sword, we have been whipped, scourged, cast into dungeons with
serpents, burnt at a stake to ashes, some of us dug out of our graves, and
martyred after our death: and she that has thus cruelly butchered thy servants
sits as Queen, arrayed in purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and carouseth
healths to the Kings and Princes of the earth in a cup of gold; and after she
has made them drunk with the wine of her abominations, she commits
spiritual filthiness with them in the face of the Sun.

Cupio me patres conscripti clementem, non dissolutum videri (says the wise
Orator) I wish that mercy, to which all virtues (as Seneca observes)
willingly give the place and yield the garland, may be still the prime gemme in
our Sovereigns Crown. I plead for mercy, which must be our best plea at
Christ's Tribunal: but I desire it to be well thought upon, whether it be
mercy or not rather cruelty to spare those who spare not your sons and
daughters, but daily entice them, and by their agents conveigh them over beyond
the Sea, to sacrifice, not their bodies, but their souls, their faith, their
religion to the Moloch of Rome. Plin. not. hist. l. 8 c. 22. Arcades scribunt
ex gente Antei cuiusdam in stagnum quoddam regionis ejus duci, vestituque in
qu^rcu suspenso ^nare and abire in desertum, transfiguratique in lupos.
Pliny writes of certain people of the family of Anteus in Arcadia, who
having put off their clothes, and swom over a deep standing poole, wander in
the wilderness, run among Wolves, and are transformed into their shape, and
after return back and do great mischief in their own country. I believe
not that there is any such family in Arcadia; but I am sure we have a sort of
men in England, who, putting off the habit of English men and Scholars, cross
the narrow Seas, converse with Romish Wolves, and degenerate into their nature,
and after they return back into their own country, make havocke of Christ's
flock. Here I cannot but cry aloud with zealous Bullenger, In Apoc. c. 2. Quae
quaeso clementia est crudelissimis lupis blandiri, ut oves innocents Christi
sanguine redemptas impune dil^nient? quae haec patientia sinere vineam Domini
ab immanissimis monstris devastati?
What clemency call you this, to suffer the Lords Vineyard to be spoiled and
laid waste by cruel Monsters? What mercy to spare the Wolves, which spare not
Christ's sheep redeemed with his precious blood? who plot treason against their
natural Prince, scandalize the State, and stain with impure breath the gold
and silver vessels of the Sanctuary, who turn religion into Statisme, or
rather into Atheism. Let it be accounted mercy not to execute the rigor of
penal Statutes upon silly seduced sheep; certainly it is cruelty to spare the
Wolves which worry them.

If any, pricked at the heart at the consideration of these things, say with
the Jews in the Acts, Acts 2.37.
Quid faciemus? What shall we do? We have used all diligence to find out
these Romish Wolves, and those that come within our reach we smite, at the
rest we set our strongest Mastives, and fray them out of our coasts:

I answer, If this were sincerely done of all hands, if some shepherds were
not seen by the Wolves before they spy them, and thereby lost their voices,
according to the Proverb, Lupi videre priores: I say if the shepherds and the
dogs bestirred themselves as they should, yet the wise man in Livie will tell
them, All will be to no great purpose till the woods and thickets be cut down,
to which they fly, and there hide themselves: Nunquam defuturi sunt lupi donec
sylvae exscindantur: you shall never be rid of these Romish wolves so long as
in all quarters of this Kingdom they have so many places of shelter to lurk
in, I had almost said Sanctuaries of defense.

I am now come home to the point, I first thought upon when I was sommoned to
speak to this honorable assembly, This Sermon was preached during the
Parliament, whereof many were present.
consisting of so many noble and worthy members of the high Court of
Parliament; and therefore here I will land my discourse, after I have given you
but one memento out of the Psalmist, Remember the children of Edom in the day
of Jerusalem, how they said, Down with it, down with it, even to the ground;
or rather, Up with it, up with it to the trembling air. Blow up King, Queen,
Prince, Parliament, Clergy, Laity, Nobility, Gentry, Commons, Laws,
Statutes, Charters, Records, all in a cloud of fire, that there remain not so
much as any cinders of them upon the earth, lest perhaps the Phoenix might
revive out of her own ashes. But praised be the God of heaven, who discovered
and defeated that plot of hell, our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
snare, the snare is broken, and we are delivered. I will close up all with
those sweet strains of the hundred forty ninth Psalm. O sing unto the Lord a
new song, let his praise be heard in the great congregation: let Israel rejoice
in him that made him, and let the children of Sion be joyful in their King:
for the Lord has pleasure in his people, and will make the meek glorious by
deliverance: let the Saints be joyful with glory, let them rejoice in their
beds: let the high Acts of the Lord be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword
in their hands, to execute vengeance upon the Romish Jezebel, and rebuke her
proselites; to bind her Priests in chains, and her Chemarims with linkes of
iron, that they may be avenged of them: as it is written, Such honor have all
his Saints. To whom, etc.

JEZEBEL SET OUT IN HER COLORS. A Sermon preached in Saint Paul's Church,
November. 20. Anno 1614. THE XXXIV. SERMON.
REVEL. 2.20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls her self a Prophetess, to teach
and seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed
unto Idols.


Right Honorable, Right Worshipful, etc.
IN this letter, indicted by the Spirit, and penned by St. John, I observed
heretofore, 1 Superscription: and therein 1 The party from whom, with his
eminent quality, the Son of God, etc. 2 The party to whom it was sent, with
the title of his dignity, the Angel of Thyatira.
2 The contents: which are so manifold, and of such importance, that if I had
the tongue of an Angel I could hardly deliver them all in particular. I have
heretofore presented you with twelve sorts of fruits answerable to the fruits
of the tree of life Apoc. 22.
described, all growing upon the two former branches of this Scripture, and
this of my text; and yet I have not gathered the half. It resembles that
wonderful tree which Pliny saw at Lib. 17. c. 16. not. hist. Arborem vidimus
^uxta Tiburtes Tulias omni genere pomorum onustam, alio ramo nucibus, alio
baccis, aliunde vite, ficis, pyris, punicis, malorumque generibus.
Tiburts, which bare all kind of delicious and wholesome fruits. Seneca his
observation is true, that Sen ep. 23. ad Lucil. Levium metallorum fructus in
summo est, illa opulentissima sunt quorum in al^o latet vena assidoe before
responsura fodienti.
baser metals are found near the top, but the richer lie deep in the earth,
affording great store of precious oar. Such is the Mine I have discovered in
this passage of Scripture: into which that you may search deeper, with more
profit and less danger, I will bear before you a clear light, made of all
the expositions of the best learned Scribes in the house of God, who, to enrich
our faith, bring forth out of their treasuries new things and old.


And to the Angel, that is, the Bishop or chief Pastor, as heretofore I
proved at large unto you. In the Old Testament we read of the ministry of
Angels; but here we find Angels of the ministry, to whom the Son of God
himself kindly and familiarly writes. Our usual form of sommoning your
attention is, Hearken unto the word of God, as it is written; which here I must
change, and say, Hearken unto the word of God, as it writes. For to the Angel
of Thyatira the second Person, which is the Word of God, thus writes.

Write. It is a great honor to receive a letter from a noble Personage: how
much more from the Son of God? St. E^. 40. Quid est aliud Scripture sacra n
^i quaedam epistola Omnipotentis Dei ad creaturam suam.
Gregory excellently amplifieth upon this point in his epistle to Theodorus
the Physician: If your excellency (says he) were from the Court, and should
receive a letter from the Emperor, you would never be quiet till you had
opened it, you would never suffer your eyes to sleep, nor your eye lids to
slumber, nor the temples of your head to take any rest, till you had read it
over again and again. Behold, the Emperor of heaven, the Lord of men and
Angels, has sent you a letter for the good of your soul, and will you neglect
to peruse it? Peruse it, my son study it, I pray thee, meditate upon it day
and night. Where letters pass one from another, there is a kind of
correspondencie and society; and such honor have all Gods Saints: they have
fellowship with the Father and the Son. O let us not sleighten such a
society, whereby we hold intelligence with heaven: let us with all reverence
receive, and with all diligence peruse, and with all carfulness answer
letters and messages sent from the Son of God, by returning sighs and
prayers back to heaven, and making our selves, in the Apostles phrase,
commendatorie letters, written, not with ink, but with the Spirit.

Thus says the Son of God. Not by spiritual regeneration, as all the children
of promise are the sons of God, but by eternal generation: not by grace of
adoption, but by nature.

Who has eyes like a flame of fire, and feet like fine brass. Eyes like a
flame of fire, piercing through the thickest darkness; feet like brass, to
support his Chuch, and stamp to powder whatsoever rises up against it; like
fine brass, pure and no way defiled by walking through the midst of the golden
candlestickes. Wheresoever he walks he makes it holy ground. Quicquid
calcaverit hic rosa fiet.

There are three sorts of members in holy Scripture attributed to our head
Christ Jesus: 1 Natural. 2 Mystical. 3 Metaphorical.


Natural he has, as perfect man.

Mystical, as head of the Church.

Metaphorical, as God.

By these members we may divide all the learned Commentatours expositions.
They who follow the natural or literal construction of the words, apply this
description to the members of Christ's glorified body in Heaven, which shine
like flaming fire, or metal glowing in a furnace. But Lyra and Carthusian have
an eye to Christ his mystical eyes, viz. Bishops and Pastors, who are the
overseers of Christ his flock, resembling fire in the heat of their zeal and
light of their knowledge, whereby they direct the feet of Christ, that is, in
their understanding; his inferior members on earth likened to fine brass, to
set forth the purity of their conversation; and described burning in a furnace,
to express their fiery trial by martyrdom. Alcasar by the feet of fine
brass understands the Preachers of the Word, whom Christ sends into all
parts to carry the Gospel. Those feet which Esaias 52.7. and Romans 10.15. How
beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace?
Esaias calls beautiful, Saint John here compares to the finest brass; which
Beda in Apoc. Pedes sunt Christiani in fine seculi, qui similes erunt
orichalcho, quod est aes per ignem and plura medicamina perductum ad auri
colorem, sic illi per acerbissimas persecutiones exercebuntur, and perducentur
ad plenam charitatis fulgorem.
Beda and Haimo will have to be copper, rendering the Greek (...) not the most
resplendent brass, such as was dug out of Mount Libanus, but Orichalchum,
that is, copper: and thus they work it to their purpose. As brass the matter
of copper, by the force of fire and strong waters and powders receives the
tincture of gold; so (say they) the Christians that shall stand last upon the
earth, termed in that respect Christ's feet, shall by many exercises of their
patience and fiery trials of their faith, be purified and refined, and changed
into precious metal, and become golden members of a golden head.

I do not utterly reject this interpretation of the mystical eyes and feet of
Christ, nor the former of the natural members of his glorified body, because
they carry a fair show and goodly luster with them: yet I more incline to the
third opinion, which refers them to the attributes of God. For (me thinks)
I see in the fiery eyes the perfection of Christ his knowledge, to which
nothing can be dark or obscure; as also his vigilant zeal over his Church,
and the fierceness of his wrath against the enemies thereof. Bullenger
conceives our Savior to be pourtrayed by the Spirit with eyes like a flame of
fire, because he enlighteneth the eyes of the godly: but Meyerus, because he
suddenly consumes the wicked; both the known properties of fire: for in
flaming fire there is both clear light and intensive heat. The light is an
emblem of his piercing sight, the heat of his burning wrath. Where the eye is
lightsome, and the object exposed to it, the eye must needs apprehend it: but
the Son of Gods eyes are most lightsome, nay rather light it self, in which
there is no darkness, and Heb. 4 13.
all things lie open and naked before him: yea, the Apoc. 2.23.
heart and the reins which he searches. In Courts of humane justice, thoughts
and intentions and first motions to evil bear no actions, because they come
not within the walk of man's justice; but it will not be so at Christ's
Tribunal, where the secrets of all hearts shall be opened. Let no man then
hope by power, or fraud, or bribes to smother the truth, or bleare the eyes of
the Judge of all flesh. For his eyes, like flames of fire, dispell all
darkness, and carry a bright light before them. Let not the adulterer watch
for the twilight, and when he has met with his wanton Dalila, carry her into
the inmost rooms, and lock door upon door, and then take his fill of love,
saying, The shadow of the night, and the privacy of the room shall conceal
me. For though none else be by, and all the lights be put out, yet he is seen,
and the Son of God is by him with eyes like a flaming fire. Let not the
Projector pretend the public good, when he intends nothing but to rob the
rich, and cheat the poor. Let not the cunning Papist under color of decent
ornaments of the Church, bring in Images and Idols; under color of
commemoration of the deceased, bring in invocation of Saints departed; under
color of extolling charity, bring in the merit of works; under color of an
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, endeavor by degrees to bring in Papal tyranny: for
the Son of God with his eyes like flaming fire sees the thin wire, and fine
thread, by which he would draw in Popery.

Now, as the knowledge of our Lord and Savior shines, so his wrath sparkles in
these eyes. When the heart is enflamed with rage, the eyes are red and Hom. Il.
(...). Virg Georg. 3. Flammantia lumina torquens. and Aen. l. 7. De alecto
flammea torquet lumina.
fiery, whereof Aristot. prob. sect. 31.
Aristotle in his Problemes yields this reason, Quia ad partem violatam
ascendit calor, because the eyes are most offended at the presence of the
object, which is hateful unto us; and therefore nature sends the beat
thither, to arm that part with revenge. If Christ's eyes be like flaming fire,
let the heart of all presumptuous sinners melt like wax before him. Let none
gather too far upon his titles of the Lamb of God, and Prince of peace, and
Savior of the world. For as he is the Lamb of God, so he is the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah: as he is the Prince of peace, so he is the Lord of Hosts: as
he is the Savior of all, especially the Elect, so he is the Judge of quick
and dead: and here he is brought in by Saint John with fire in his eyes to
consume, and a sword in his mouth to smite, and brass in his feet to stamp his
enemies to powder.

And his feet like fine brass. Some of the Interpreters demand, why brass is
here preferred to gold? and they yield this reason, because brass is a
stronger and harder metal, and the purpose of the Holy Ghost was to represent
not only the glory of Christ in the splendor of this metal, but also his
power in the strength and solidity thereof. Now gold is a soft and bowing
metal, not so apt to represent Christ his invincible power; and therefore here
it is said, that his feet were like fine brass, not burnished gold. The
Heathen attributed to their gods feet of a heavier and baser metal, to wit, of
lead; whence grew that Proverb among them, That God had leaden feet, but Eras.
Adag.
iron hands: in which their meaning was, that God proceeds slowly to the
punishment of wicked men, but when he overtakes them, pays them home;
tarditatem supplicii gravitate compensans: but our Savior, you see in my Text,
has feet of a quicker, stronger, and more precious metal, of finest brass,
to support his Church, and to knock and tread down whatsoever exalts it
self against his truth and kingdom. Now I marvel not that Saint Mat. 3.11.
John thought not himself worthy to unloose Christ his shoe latchet, who has
such precious and beautiful feet, resembling fine brass glowing in a furnace,
on which In Apoc. c. 1. Dominus purgatissimos habet pedes, omnem calcat
impietatem, omnem absumit haereticam pravitatem, and vitam impuram.
Bullenger engraveth this posie, Our Lord has most clean and pure feet,
wherewith he tramples on Satan, he treads down all impiety, and burns up all
heresy and impurity as he walks in the midst of the seven golden
Candlestickes. But I may insist no longer upon these brazen feet of our
Savior, I must haste to that which follows.

I know, that is, I approve. Gods knowledge of any thing in the Scripture
phrase often implies his approbation, as Psalm. 1. v. ult. As on the contrary,
those whom he condemns he is said not to know: Mat. 7.23.
Depart from me, I know you not, ye that work iniquity. I know you not, that
is, I acknowledge you not, or take no special notice of you. God does not
willingly know any thing but that which is good; whereas on the contrary, most
men by their good will will know no good by any, but all the evil they can:
like flies they light no where but upon the scarres and sores of their
brethren, and after the manner of horse-leaches they greedily suck out their
corrupt blood. Whereas they might gather many sweet flowers in the Spouse her
garden, they cull out nothing but weeds; much like the covetous Vintner, who
sold abroad all his best wine, and kept the worst for his house; and being
asked of one who saw him walking in his cellar what he was then adoing,
answered, Sphinx Philosophica. c. In bonorum copia malum quaero.
In abundance and store of good I seek for bad. I would we had not just cause
to renew the complaint of Gregory Nazianzen; The only godliness we glory in,
is to find out somewhat whereby we may judge others to be ungodly: the only
virtue is to find vice in others, as if to soil others were the readiest
means to clear our selves. To convict us of this malevolent disposition I
need no other proof than the use of the verb animadverto in Latin, and mark
in English: for animadvertere in aliquem signifies to censure, or punish; and
to show that we mark nothing so much as men's vices and deformities, the very
word mark in English, without any epithet added unto it, signifies a
deformity: as when we say, Such an one is a marked man; and, Take heed of those
whom God has marked. As venomous Serpents are nourished with poisonous roots
and herbs, so men of corrupt minds greedily feed upon other men's corruptions,
and desire to know nothing more than the wants and infirmities of their
brethren; herein direct contrary to the goodness of God, who is here said to
know that only which he knows to be good and approves; as the opposition
between this sentence and that which follows (Notwithstanding I have a few
things against thee) makes it manifest. I know then, that is, I like, or I
approve of

Thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and patience. And thy works,
that is, thy works begun, and thy works ended; the works of thy faith, and
the works of thy calling; thy works at the first, and thy works at the last.
I commend thee for thy love of me, and thy service to me, and thy faith in me,
and thy patience for me, and thy proficiency in all these, which most evidently
appears by this,

That thy last works are more than the first. Take we here by the way an
infallible note of a true Christian, which is growth in grace and godliness:
he is like Vespasian in the Poet, melior pejore aevo, better in his worser age.
He never stands at a stay, but Psalm. 84.7.
goes on from strength to strength: like the trees planted in the house of the
Lord, they Psalm. 92.14.
still bring forth more fruit in their age. As the John 2.10.
water-pots of stone, which our Savior filled with wine by miracle, yielded
the best wine at the last; Thou have kept the good wine even till now: and as
the Pro. 14.18. But the path of the just is a^ the shining light that shines
more and more until the per^ect day.
light of the Sun shines more and more till it be perfect day: as the branches

that they may bring forth more fruit. John 15.2.
Herein the supernatural motions of the Spirit resemble all natural motions,
which, as the Philosopher teaches us, are velociores in fine quam in
principio, swifter in the end than in the beginning. Of all the proper marks
of the elect children of God this is the most certain, and therefore St. Phil.
3.13, 14.
Paul instanceth in it only: This one thing I do, forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before. I press

St. 2 Pet. 3.18.
Peter closes with it, as the upshot of all: Ye therefore, beloved, beware
lest ye fall from your own steadfastness: but grow in grace, and in the
knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is not so in the spiritual
as in the corporal augmentation: for the body grows, according to all
dimensions, but to a certain age; but the soul may and must grow in spiritual
graces till the hour of death: and the reason of the difference is, because
the aetas consistentiae of our body is in this life, but of our soul in the
life to come. Here the body arriveth to the (...) highest pitch of perfection,
but the soul arriveth not to hers til we come to the heavenly Jerusalem, and
to the Heb. 12.23.
Church of the first borne, and to the spirits of just men made perfect. O that
our blessed Redeemer had here made an end of his letter, and sealed up all the
Angels praises with this sweet close! what an admirable president should we
have had of a perfect Pastor? what joy should have been in the presence of
the Angels for the unspotted integrity and absolute perfection of this Angel?
But because (as St. Ep. ad ^ust. Apud Deum nihil tantum suave placet nisi quod
habet in se aliquid mordacis veritatis.
Jerome acutely observes) that there was no use of honey in the sacrifices of
the old law, because nothing pleases God which is only sweet, and has not in
it somewhat of biting truth; therefore after the sweet insinuation, I know,
etc. there follows a sharp reprehension, there is a Notwithstanding that
stands in this Angels light, and obscureth the luster of all his former
virtues.

Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee. Origin handling those word,

As for me (says that humble Saint) I confess my sins to thy glory, but my
own shame: my sinful delights contend with my godly sorrows, and on whether
side stands the victory I know not: woe is me, Lord have mercy upon me.
Again, my ungodly sorrows contend with my holy joys, and on which side
stands the victory I know not: woe is me, Lord have mercy on me. Behold, I
hide not my wounds: thou art a Physician, I am sick; thou art a Surgeon, I am
thy Patient; thou art pitiful, I am in misery. If the light be darkness, how
great is the darkness? If our righteousness be as menstruous clouts (Esaias
64.6.) what are our monstrous sins? Yet the Prophet says not that the covers
of our sins, but the robes of our righteousness are as filthy rags.
Whereupon Origin. in ep. ad Romans c. 3. Quis vel super justitia ^ua gloriabitur,
cum audiat Deum per Prophetam dicentem, quia omnis iustitia vestra sicut pannus

Origin groundeth that question, which may gravel all those that build upon
the sinking sands of their own merits: Who dare brag of his righteousness,
when he hears God saying by his Prophet, All our righteousness is as filthy
rags? Surely Pope Gregory was no Papist, at least in this point: for he
prizeth the best endeavors of grace in us at a lower rate than Luther or
Calvin; they say our purest coin is allayed with some quantity of baser
metal, he, that it is no better than dross: Greg. mor. l. 9. c. 11. Omnis
humana iustitia injustitia esse convincitu^, si district^ judicetur.
All humane justice (says he) examined according to Gods strict justice, is
injustice. Therefore if we say or think God has nothing against us, he has
much against us for so saying or thinking. For Psalm. 19.12.
who knows how often he offends? O cleanse thou us all from our secret
faults. Had we arrived to the perfection of this Angel in my text, and could
exhibit letters testimonial signed by our Savior, such as this Angel of
Thyatira might; yet were it not safe to capitulate with God: notwithstanding
all our virtues and graces he has somewhat against us, either for sins of
omission, or sins of commission, or at least sins of permission. I have
somewhat against thee, that thou suffer

The woman, (...). Com. in Apoc.
Ambrosius Ansbertus, Richell, Dionysius, Carthusianus, and Hugo Cardinalis,
translate the word in the Original, uxorem, thy wife: which is the rather
worth the noting in these Popish Interpreters, who yet condemn Priests
marriage. Doubtless this Angel was a good Bishop, for he is highly commended
by our Savior; yet had he his wife by their confession. Why therefore may not
sacred persons enter into the sacred bands of matrimony? Is it because, as Pope
Sirycius, and after him Cardinal Bellarmine, bear us in hand, conjugall acts
and matrimonial duties stand not with the sanctity of the Priests function?
Now verily this is a strange thing, that marriage, according to the doctrine of
their Church, is a Sacrament conferring grace, and yet a disparagement to the
most sacred function: marriage is a holy Sacrament, and yet Priests are bound
by a Sacrament (that is, an oath) never to receive it: marriage was instituted
in Paradise, in the state of man's innocence, when the image of God, which the
Apostle interprets to be holiness and righteousness, shined most brightly
in him, and yet it is a cloud, nay, a blurre to the most holy calling: marriage
was appointed by God as a special remedy against fornication and all
uncleanness, and yet is an impeachment to holiness. The Aaronical Priesthood
by Gods own order was to be continued in the line of Aaron by generation, not
election; and yet marriage cannot stand with the holiness of Priesthood. Who
of the Patriarchs before the Flood was holier than Enoch, who walked with God,
and was translated, that he should not see death? of the Prophets under the
Law, than Ezekiel? of the Apostles, than St. Peter and Philip? and yet of Enoch
we read, that Genesis 5.22.
he begat sons and daughters: and Saint Chrysostom. in Genesis homil. 21. (...),
etc.
Chrysostom bids us take special notice of it, that the Holy Ghost says in
the same Verse, he walked with God, and beg at sons and daughters, to teach
us that the bonds of matrimony are no such fetters, that they hinder us from
walking with God. Ezekiels Ezekiel 24.16.

p. 327. 'H (...).
Clemens Alexandrinus mightily confounds, and convinces those ancient
Heretics, the forerunners of our Papists, who disparaged this holy ordinance
of God: What, says he, will they blame the Apostles themselves? For Peter and
Philip begat children; Philip also gave his daughters in marriage. Neither can
our adversaries evade these instances, by saying that the Apostles indeed had
wives before they were ordained Priests, but after they entered into that holy
calling, forsook them, and had no more commerce with them. For Clem. strom. l.
7 p. 529. Arunt B. Petrum cum vidisset uxorem suam duci ad mortem, nomine
quoque compellasse, ac dixisse, Heus tu, memento Domini.
Clemens informs us, that Saint Peter's wife kept with him till her death, and
that when he saw her led to martyrdom, he called to her by name, and
encouraged her, saying, Remember the Lord.

Howbeit the major part of the Expositors take not Jezebel here for the Bishops
wife, but a disciple of the Nicolaitans, who is here named Jezebel, because
she resembled Jezebel especially in three particulars.

1. As Jezebel brought amongst the Israelites the false worship of the Idol
Baal; so this woman labored to bring into this Church of Thyatira, Idolatry
and other pernicious errors in doctrine and practice.

2. 2 Kin. 9 22.
Jezebel was given to fornication, for which vice the Holy Ghost brandeth this
woman also.

3. Jezebel was a woman of authority, and by her place and dignity did
countenance and maintain* Idolatry; and so it is likely that this was a woman
of some place and rank, which she abused to countenance wicked opinions, and
seduce Gods servants. Hieron. de nom. Heb.
Jezebel in the Hebrew signifies fluxum sanguinis, or stirquilinium, an issue
of blood or doung; both which were verified in the wife of Ahab, whose
abominable life and fearful death ye may see set forth in lively colors in
the book of 2 Kin. 9.33. ad finem. They threw her down, and some of her blood
was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses, and he trod her under foot. and
Ver. 37. The carkeis of Jezebel was as doung upon the face of the field.
Kings, to breed in all men and women a detestation of the one, by the shame
and horror of the other. A lamentable spectacle (dear Christians) to see the
daughter and wife of a King trampled under foot in the dirt, and the dogs
tearing her flesh, and licking up her blood. She who spent so much time in
dressing and tricking up her self at the window, is thrown down headlong out
of that window: she that looked so high, falls full low, and is trod under
foot by her servant: she who spilt Naboths innocent blood in Jezreel,
expiateth the place with her own blood: that face, on which she a little
before had laid costly colors and ointments, is now besmeared with dirt, and
stained with her own blood: that flesh of hers which she pampered with all
kinds of delicious meats, is now cast to dogs.

Let them hear this and fear who wear Jezebels colors, and tread in her
steps; who defile themselves with corporal or spiritual fornication; who
either idolatrize or idolize, worship painted images, or make themselves such.
Jezebel was the first we read of, that took the pensill out of the hand of
her Maker, endeavoring to mend his workmanship; and what became of her you
heard but now. And howsoever some of late, as they have sowed pillowes under
men's elbowes, so have tempered colors also for women, and made apologies for
painting, yet all the ancient Fathers condemn it as a foul sin. Saint Cyp.
de hab. virg. Nonne metuis oro quae talis es, ne cum resurrectionis dies
venerit, artif^x tuus te non recognoscat? ad sua praemia and promissa venientem
excludat, and removeat, increpans vigore censoris and judicis: opus hoc meum
non est, nec haec imago nostra est, cutem falso medicamine polluisti, crinem
adultero color mutasti, Deum videre non poteris, cum oculi tibi non sint quos
Deus fecit, sed quos Diabolus infecit.
Cyprian thus schools a young Jezebel in his days: Art not thou afraid, says
he, that plaisterest thy face, and paintest thy body, lest at the day of
judgment thy Maker will not know thee? but when thou pressest among the rest
to receive the promised rewards to his servants, will put thee back, saying:
Who art thou? what face do I see? this is none of my workmanship, I never drew
this feature. Saint Jerome. ep. ad Furiam. Quid facit in facie Christianae
purpurissa and cerussa? fomenta libidinum, impudicae mentis inditia? quomodo
flere potest pro peccatis suis, quae lachrymis cutem nudat, and sulcos ducit in
facie? qua fiducia erigat ad Deum vultus, quos conditor non agnoscat?
Jerome takes the like up in his time as sharply: What makes paint and
complexion on the face of a Christian? it is no other than the fire of youth,
the fuel of lust, the evidence of an unchaste mind: How can she weep for her
sins, for fear of washing away her paint, and making furrows in her face?
How dare she look her Maker in the face, who has defaced his image in her
self? But because I see it will be to no purpose, to draw this their sin of
painting in its proper colors before them (for they cannot blush) I therefore
leave them, and come to her in my Text

Which calls her self a Prophetess. As Novatus the Schismaticke ordained
himself a Bishop, so Jezebel the Nicolait anointed (or rather painted her
self) a Prophetess, that by this means she might teach more freely, and
persuade more powerfully. The true Prophets of God received their name and
calling from God, and wonderfully confirmed the sincerity of their doctrine by
the truth of their miracles, and the truth of their miracles by the holiness
of their doctrine. So many tongues as they spoke with, with so many
testimonies; so many miracles as they wrought, with so many hands they signed
and sealed their calling: but deceivers and impostors grace themselves with
high and strange titles, and glorious names, to bleare the eyes of the simple.

Bristow in his motives, and Cardinal Bellarmine in his book of the notes of
the Church, and other of the Pope his stoutest Champions, fight against us with

But to throw away foyles, and come to the sharp: Will they thus argue in good
earnest, Protestants are called Sectaries or Schismatickes, and Papists
Catholics, therefore they are so? Will they condemn the Primitive Christians
for Atheists, because the heathen usually so termed them, in regard they had no
faith in their gods? Will they brand St. Paul for an Heretic, or the Truth
himself for a Seducer, because ignorance and malice fastened these calumnies
and blasphemies upon them? Protestants are termed Heretics by Papists, and
are not Papists also by Protestants? what gain then the Papists hereby?
Papists are termed Catholics; I would know by whom? If by any Protestant, they
know well it is but by a Sarcasme, or Ironie; as Alexander was called a god by
the Lacedaemonians, Quoniam Alexander vult esse deus, sit deus.

Yea, but they are so styled by all that adhere to the Church of Rome: and were
not the Arrians called Catholics by Arrians? the Nestorians Orthodoxe by
Nestorians? the Novatians the best Christians by Novatians? the Donatists sole
members of the Church by Donatists? the most impure Sect of Anabaptists the
Family of love by those of their own cut? If this argument may pass for
current; Papists term themselves Catholics, therefore they are so: what
exception can be taken against these and the like? The Turks call themselves
Saracens, therefore they are the offspring of Sarah: they of Satan's Synagogue
call themselves Apoc. 3.9.
Jews, therefore they are Jews indeed: the Angel of Sardis had a name that he

lived, therefore he was not dead: the Angel of Apoc. 3.17.
Laodicea said he was rich, and needed nothing, therefore he was not wretched,
and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: Jezebel called her self a
Prophetess, therefore she was so indeed. Without question Jezebel set some
fairer color upon the matter than this, else she could never have dazzled the
eyes of Gods servants: well she might offer to teach in the Church under this
pretense, which yet S. Paul expressly forbids a 1 Cor. 14.34.
woman to do; but certainly she could never have foiled any servant of God
with so weak an argument, grounded upon a bare title assumed by her self: yet
the Spirit says, that she not only taught, but prevailed also with some, and
seduced them.

To teach and seduce my servants. I doubt not but at the reading of these words
your thoughts trouble you, and you begin to question whether this doctrine is
not a seduction, to teach that any of Gods servants can be seduced. Can any
elect child of God fall from grace? Is it possible to pluck any of Christ's
members from his body? Can the Sunbeams by any wind or tempest be stirred
out of their place? 1 John 2.19.

Cyprians observation as true as it is elegant? The wind blows not away the
corn, neither is a tree that has taken a deep root in the earth overthrown
in a tempest: it is but chafe which the wind scatters abroad, and they are
hollow and rotten trees, that are blown down in a tempest.

To dispell all mists of ambiguity, and clear the truth in this point, I must
acquaint you with two sorts of Christ's servants, or retainers at least; some
wear his cloth and cognizance, but do him little or no service, others
perform faithful service unto him: some give him their names only, others their
hearts also: some profess outwardly that they are Christians, but have
unbeleeving hearts: others are within that they profess without: some are
called only to the knowledge of the truth, others are chosen also to be heirs
of salvation. Of these latter our Savior speaks in St. John; Joh. 10.27, 28
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I will give
unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man
pluck them out of my hands. But of the former the words of my text seem to
be meant.

Howbeit, because the Discerner of all hearts calls them his servants,
saying, to seduce my servants; and it is not likely that he would grace
hypocrites with so honorable an appellation: we may yield somewhat more in
this point, and without prejudice to the truth acknowledge, that the true
servants of God, and ministers also of Christ Jesus, may be sometimes seduced
out of the right way, but not far, I am sure not irrevocably. The difference
between them and others in this respect, is like that which the Cic. tusc. 1.
Boni in ertorem sicut aes Corinthium in aeruginem, and incidunt rarius and
facilius revocantur.
Orator observes between the Corinthian and common brass: as the brass of
Corinth is longer ere it rust, and when it is rustie is sooner scowred, and
more easily recovers the former brightness than other brass; so good men are
hardlier withdrawn from the true faith, and more easily reclaimed from their
errors, than those who bear no sincere love to the truth, but are wedded to
their own opinions whatsoever they are, and oftentimes blinded by obstinately
setting their eyes against the bright beams of the Word. Out of the Arc of
Noah, which was a type of the Church, there flew two Genesis 8.7.
birds, a Raven and a Dove; the Raven after he had taken his flight returned
not again, but the Dove came back with an Olive branch in her bill. The Dove
(says Saint Cypr. adver. N^vit. Prosp l. de prom. c. 7.
Cyprian) represented the seduced Catholic, who after he is gone out of the
Church, never finds rest till he return back with an Olive branch of peace
in his mouth, and be reconciled to the Church: But the Raven is the obstinate
Heretic, who leaves the Church with a purpose never to return to her
again. And many such Ravens have been of late let fly out of the Arc, which
never return again; or if they return, it is to prey upon the sick and
weak members of our Church, and to pick out the eyes of her dearest children:
and I pray God we may never have cause to renew the Poets complaint, Dat
veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas.

To commit fornication. Fornication, as Lyra in Apoc. c. 2. Fornicatio est
quadruplex, in ^nimo, simulierem concupisc^s, in actu, in cultu Idolorum, in
amore terrenorum.
Lyranus harpeth upon the word, is committed four manner of ways. 1. By the
impure lust of the heart. 2. By the unclean act of the body. 3. By the
religious worship of Images or Idols. 4. By the immoderate love of earthly
vanities.


For when the soul turns away from God, and sets her love wholly upon
vile and base creatures, so far below her, that God has placed them under
her feet; what does she but like a Lady of noble descent, married to a Prince,
which disloyally leaves his bed, and makes love to the groom of her chamber?
Certainly this is sordidum adulterium, not only filthy, but base adultery.

Howbeit, I take it, this was not the stain of the Church of Thyatira; but
either fornication properly so called, which is corporal Idolatry; or
idolatry, which is spiritual fornication. For idolatry defiles the Spirit, as
adultery polluteth the flesh: idolatry provokes God, as adultery does man to
jealousy: as adultery is a just cause of separation between man and his wife,
so idolatry makes a breach betwixt God and the soul, and causes in the end a
divorce: by reason of which separation for disloyalty and unfaithfulness,
Saint Cypr. de hab. virg. Prius vidu^s quam nuptas, non mariti, sed Christi
adulteras.
Cyprian wittily terms certain virgins widows before they were married
wives, yea and adulteresses too; not to their husbands, (which they had not)
but to Christ, to whom they had plighted their troth. And look how a jealous
husband would be transported with passion, if he should find his wife
embracing a stranger in bed; so does the wrath of God burn like fire, and his
jealousy break out like a bright flame against such as Pigmalion-like
entertain an Idol for him in the bed of their soul, and commit fornication
with it.

To commit fornication, and to eat meat sacrificed unto Idols. There is so
near affinity betwixt carnal and spiritual fornication, that few defile
their souls with the one, but are defiled in body with the other; as Jezebels
scholars here, who by eating meat sacrificed unto Idols, were provoked to
corporal uncleanness. One sin, as it breeds, so it feeds another: and
as blindness of eyes was inflicted upon Elymas for his blindness of heart, so
God in his secret and just judgment here punished the Nicolaits spiritual
with corporal fornication; that as they provoked him to jealousy by
familiarly and freely conversing with Idolaters, so they were provoked to
jealousy by their wives keeping company with adulterers.

Touching eating meats sacrificed unto Idols, which the Spirit in this place,
and Saint 1 Cor. 10.20.
Paul, and all the Acts 15.20.
Apostles in their decretall Epistle so strictly forbid, you are to understand
that the Christians in the Primitive Church, in respect of their acquaintance
and alliance with the heathen that dwelt among them, did not stick, when they
were invited by them, to go to their banquets and feasts, which they kept in
the Temples of their Idols, when they sacrificed unto them, and there they
spent the remainder of such cates and wines as had been offered to their
Paynim gods. The pretense which the Christians had for their resorting to these
feasts was this, that they knew the Idol was nothing, and therefore, giving
thanks to God for his creatures, they did eat of all things without any
scruple of conscience, howsoever they had been used, and to whomsoever they
had been offered. This our Savior here reproves the Thyatirians for, and St.
Paul the Corinthians in the place above alleged; showing, that though the
Idol was nothing in it self, yet since the Gentiles did offer such things as
were served-in at their Idols feast, not to God but to Devils, the Christians
could not sit at the same tables with them, rejoicing and feasting in the names
of them, but they must be partakers of their idolatry. The maine argument he
uses may be thus reduced to form.

They that eat of things offered unto Idols are partakers of the Devils table,
and are as it were in mess with him: But none of Gods family may table with
the Devil; therefore all Christians ought to make conscience of accepting the
heathens invitation to such feasts, wherein they were to feed upon the Devils
relics. Now that the servants of God may not meddle or make with the Devil
or any of his instruments, needs no proof at all. 2 Cor. 6.14.
For what Communion has light with darkness? or what fellowship has Christ
with Belial? And that they that keep gaudy days for the Devil, and make
merry with his relics, have fellowship with him, the Apostle shows by the
like examples. They that eat of the sacramental bread have their communion
with Christ, they that eat of the legal sacrifices are partakers of the Altar;
even so they that eat things offered unto Idols divide commons as it were with
the D^vell.

Thus have I glanced at all the parts of this Scripture; but my principal aim
was from the beginning at Jezebel, set as a fair or rather foul mark in the
midst of this verse (I have somewhat against thee, that thou suffer
Jezebel.) It is not only evil to do, but also to suffer evil, when it is in
in our power to hinder it; as I proved heretofore at large by arguments drawn

1. From the Law, forbidding to plow with an Ox and an Ass, and punishing
Idolaters with death.

2. From the Gospel, denying the service of two Masters, and interdicting all
fellowship and communion of light with darkness, or Christ with Belial.

3. From the Spirits bill of enditement, framed against the Angels of Pergamus
and Thyatira, for tolerating the Nicolaitans.

4 From Gods threatening to cut off all such as swear by him, and by Malchim.

5 From the Kings command in the parable, to compel all the guests that were
bid to come to his marriage feast.

6. From the imputation which is laid by the Spirit upon many Kings of Israel
and Judah, for not taking away the high places.

7. From the examples of Asa, Josiah, Ezechiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Constantine,
Jovian, Theodosius, and other religious Princes, who by severe laws restrained
heresy and idolatry, and constrained the true worship of God.

8. From the verdict and depositions of the ancient Fathers, Tertullian,
Cyprian, Jerome, Austine, Leo, Gregory, Clemens Alexandrinus, Epiphanius, and
Bernard, who all strengthen the arms of the Magistrate, and sharpen his sword
against heretics.

9 From the laws of the ancient Grecians, Romans, and almost all the heathen,
who censured some way or other all innovation in religion, and profanation of
divine worship.

Lastly, from the great danger of heresy, which like a canker soon spreads
over the whole body of the Church, and, if it be not looked into, kills, and
that eternally, thousands of souls, breaks the bands of nature, and cutteth
asunder all sinews of humane society; puts enmity, variance, and implacable
discords in families, sows seeds of sedition in the State, reaches dagges
and daggers to subjects to assacinate the sacred persons of the Lords
anointed, lays traynes in the deep vaults of disl^yall hearts, to blow up
Parliaments, and offer whole Kingdoms for an Holocaust. It now remains that
I appeach the Whore of Babylon of Jezebalisme, and discover her filthy
abominations, and abominable filthiness in the face of the sun.

The Spirit here describes Jezebel by three marks: 1. Imposture, She calls
her self a Prophetess. 2. Impurity, She teaches to commit fornication. 3.
Idolatry, She allows eating meat sacrificed unto idols.


With these three crimes I dare more confidently charge the Roman Synagogue,
because with a whorish forehead she seems rather to stand upon the
justification of them, than the denial. For among her religious practices she
reckons pious frauds, as if she verily believed that which heathen Varro
writes, Expedit falli^n religione civitates.
That it is expedient for men to be cheated in matter of religion. And hereupon
Vincentius Bellovacensis in the life of Saint Dominicke, intitles one chapter,
De sancta ejus hypocrisi, Of his holy hypocrisy: And for impurity, Casa the
Archbishop of Beneventum lays colors of eloquence upon that foul sin,
which God punished in Sodom with fire and brimstone. And for idolatry, Gregory
de Valentia, the prime of the Schoolmen, professedly pleads for it, and
endeavors to prove it to be lawful out of the words of Saint Peter; 1 Pet.
4.3. Greg. de Val. de cult. ^mag. Quid attinebat ita det^rminate cultus
simulacrorum illicitos notar^, si omnino nullos simula^hrorum cultus licitos
esse censuisset?
When ye walked in lasciviousness, lusts, revellings, banquettings, and
unlawful and abominable idolatries. What need (says he) Saint Peter deter
us from unlawful idolatries, if some kind of idolatry were not lawful? Good
God! Idolatry lawful, holy hypocrisy, pious frauds, honest sodomy! Did ever
Nicolaus of Antiochia, or Jezebel of Thyatira set abroach such impure and
unsavory doctrine? did ever the Carpocratians, who let the reins loose to all
kinds of lewdness and villainy, maintain more damnable positions?

But to keep close to the pattern in my text, and to draw a perfect picture
of the Church of Rome by notes taken from Jezebel.

Imposture.
First, Jezebel called her self a Prophetess: and does not the Church of Rome
usurp the same title, and boast of her Propheticke Spirit? If any be ignorant
hereof, let him cast but a look into L. 4. c. 15. D^odecima nota est lumen
propheticum.
Bellarmine his book of the notes of the Church, there shall he see Lumen
propheticum, the light of prophecy, drawn out in a fair and goodly
character, for the twelfth note of the Roman Church. You see the first mark
of Jezebel visible in the Church of Rome: As Jezebel calls her self a
Prophetess, so the Church of Rome arrogateth to her self that supernatural
gift.

Impurity.
The second mark is as foul as the other is fair in show: She teaches to
commit fornication. I would be loath to cast so foul an aspersion upon the
Roman Church, if the ancient Rubric in the Canon law blushed any thing at
these words, Distinct. 34. Qui non habet uxorem loco illius concubinam debet
habere.
He that has not a wife, ought to have a concubine in stead of her: or the
Pope his holiness were ashamed to draw a revenue of many thousand Ducats by
the year out of somewhat worse than Vespasian his tribute ex lotio. But since
the Marozia of Sergius, the Matildis of Gregory the s venth, the Lucretia of
Alexander the sixth, the Magdalena of Leo the tenth, the Constantia of Paul the
third, were as infamous as Ovids Corinna; since ancient Popes have erected
stews, and later take toll of them at this day in Rome, Vid. Wess^l Groni^g.
de indulgent.
Avennion, and elsewhere; since ancienter Popes have dispensed with unnatural
lusts, and the later with incestuous marriages; since the Riarius of Sixtus the
fourth, the Germanus of Julius the second, the Hippolytus of Leo the tenth, and
Innocentius de monte of Julius the third, gave but too much cause to Mantuan,
and other later Poets to proclaim to the world, Sanctus ager scurris,
venerabilis ara cinoedis
Servit, honorandae divum Ganymedibus aedes.
Since their own L. method. concord. Ne admittantur sacra concubinariorum, quos
Deus magis odit qu^m manifestarios incestus.
Wicelius professes himself scandalized at the allowed concubines of
Mass Priests; and the Germans in their L. centum gravam. Gervam. Episcopi, and
eorum Officiales, non tantum sacerdotum tolerant concubinatum, dummodo certa
persolvatur pecunia, sed and Sacerdotes continentes, and qui absque concubinatu
degunt, concubinatus censum persolvere cogunt.
grievances put up this for one, That the Bishops and their Officials do not
only tolerate concubines in Priests, so they pay a certain rate for them, but
also constrain Priests, who live continently, and keep no concubines, to pay
the former tax: since Picus Mirandula (in ep. ad Leo. 10.) and Cardinal
Alliacus in his treatise of the reformation of the Church, report of their
Cells, that they were become mere stews: since Costerus, yea and Cardinal
Bellarmine, teach in express words, That it is a greater sin in a Priest or
Votary to marry, than to commit fornication; Est majus malum sic nubere quam
fornicari: since Panormitan their great Lawyer delivers it for a ruled case,
Panor. extra de consang. and affin. Ideo hodie ex simplici fornicatione
clericus non deponitur.
That a Clergy man is not to be deposed for simple fornication: nay, since the
Council of Toledo Council. Tol. Potest admitti ad communionem qui concubinam
habet, modo non sit uxoratus.
admits such persons to the holy Communion, who keep a concubine (so they
be not married:) no Papist can have an action of slander against me, for
charging their Church with somewhat more than bare toleration of simple
fornication. Verily Espenc. com. in Tit. c. 1.
Espenceus had good cause to affirm, That more naughtiness and filthiness
might be learned out of Taxa camerae Apostolicae, (whereunto I add Zanche's
de Matrimonio, and other Casuists) than out of all the obscene satyrs, and
epigrammes of profane Poets. What Christian ears can endure that preface of
Pope Gregory, Greg. extrav. de jud. c. 4. De adulterio, and aliis minoribus
criminibus, potest Episcopus cum Clericis post poenitentiam dispensare.
For adultery and other lesser sins the Bishop may dispense with a Priest
after penance.

But I list not to bring to light other of their works of darkness; let the
night cover her own shame. I proceed from Jezebels corporal to her spiritual
whoredom, wherein the Church of Rome exceeds her. For Jezebel taught only
that it was lawful to keep company, and make merry with Idolaters, and
partake of their offerings: but the Church of Rome partaketh with them in their
Idoll-worship. For albeit she pretends that she tendereth no religious
service to the Idols of the Heathen, the enemies of God, but to the images of
Saints, and shrines of Martyrs; this no way clears her from spiritual
uncleanness. For it will not be allowed for a good plea in a disloyal wife,
to say that she gave no entertainment to any of her husbands enemies, but
only made much of his dearest friends, and admitted them into bed for his
sake. The adultery in it self is foul, with whomsoever it be committed; and
Idol-service in it self is abominable, to whomsoever it be performed. To pay
the debt of conjugall love to any save her husband in a wife is adultery; and
to tender divine honor to any save God is idolatry. Therefore if we can
bring any good proof hereof, that the Church of Rome does this, and avoweth
the doing of it, we do her no wrong to call her the great Whore, of whose cup
of abominations whosoever drink become so giddie, that they fall before
stocks and stones; like men whose brains are intoxicated, take images and
pictures for men and women, bring presents to them, put costly apparel on
them, speak to them, embrace and kiss them. Lactan. divin. instit. l. 2.
Adorant insensibilia, quisentiunt; irrationabilia, qui sapiunt; exanima qui
vivunt; terrena, qui oriuntur e coelo.
O sottish folly! the living image of God falls down before dumb and dead
pictures and statues; men to whom God has given sense and reason, adore
unreasonable and senseless creatures; they who are capable of wisdom ask
counsel of stocks and stones; they who receive their souls from heaven, do
homage, and perform religious service to the vilest and basest creatures on
the earth. O curvae in terra animae, and coelestium inanes.

But to draw a formal bill of enditement against the Church of Rome.

Whatsoever Church attributes divine honor to a creature, is guilty of
abominable Idolatry:

But the Church of Rome attributes divine honor to diverse creatures;

Ergo she is guilty of abominable Idolatry.

The proposition of this syllogism is impregnable; and if it be assaulted, we
have an Reynold. l. 2. de Idol. Romans eccl. c. 3. and 9. probat. ex Romans 1.13.
and 2.12. Jude 17. and Acts 7 41. and Psalm. 115.5, 6, 7, 8. and Aug. l. 1. de
Trin. c. 6. and Tertul. de Idol. c. 1. and Cypr. de exhort. martyr. c. 2. and
Lactan. divin. instit. l. 1. c. 19. and Nazianz. orat. in Christ. not. and
Aquin. in ep. ad Ephesians. c. 5.
army of authorities already mustered for the defense of it; therefore I
fortify the assumption against which the Adversary is like to lay his
batteries. Whosoever allow the same honor to the Image, and to him whom it
represents, that is to say, to the Image of God and God himself, to the
Image of Christ and Christ himself, they by a necessary consequent yield
divine honor to Images, which are creatures: but Alens. 3. p. q. 39. art. ult.

Carthusian, Capreol. in 3. sent. distinc. 9.
Capreolus, Henric. quodlib. 10. q. 6. Idem honor debetur Imagini and exemplari.
Henricus, and many other jointly teach, that the same honor is due to the
Image, and to the person represented by it: and particularly Suarez. in p. 3.
Thom. Tom. 1. disput. 54. sec. 4, 5.
Suarez contendeth, that divine honor is to be given to the Images of the
Trinity, by the decrees of the Council of Trent: therefore the Church of Rome
by her chiefest pillars supporteth and maintains idolatry in the highest
degree. Which will yet appear more evidently by these few instances: 1 Do
they not devote themselves, dedicate Temples, consecrate Altars, appoint
offices, make daily prayers, vow pilgrimages, and present offerings to the
blessed Virgin, and do all such outward acts as properly appertain to Aug. l.
3. c. 32. de Civit. Dei. Templa sacra, Sacerdotes and quicquid ad latriam
pertinet.
Latria? Is not this to equalize her with her Son? Surely Vega in Ap^c. 12.
sec. 2. Constituta est super omnem creaturam, and quaecunque Jesu curvat genu,
matri quoque pronus supplicat; and filii gloriam cum matre non tam communem
judico quam eandem.
Vega and Biels words import no less: She is placed (says Vega) above all
creatures, and whosoever boweth the knee to Jesus, falls down flat before his
mother; the glory of the mother and the sons I account to be the same. Almighty
God (says Exposit. super Can. Mis.
Biel) has divided his kingdom between himself and her, in such sort that
all matter of justice he reserveth to himself, but matter of mercy he
refers to her. In which consideration, or some such like, it is, that in
countries subject to the Sea of Rome, all men and women, wheresoever they are,
in the City or the field, thrice a day, when the Ave marie bell rings, send up
their united devotions to her; and where one professes himself a devoto to
our Savior, whose Towns devote themselves to her: where one Edw. Sanas his
relation of Religion.
prays at a crucifix, ten pray at her Image: where one fasteth on Friday,
which they account our Lords day, many fast on Saturday, which they count our
Ladies day. To conclude: they conclude all their prayers with an Ave Maria, as
we do with our Lords prayer, and most of their treatises with Laus deiparae
Virgini, praise be to the Virgin mother of God: and in the Psalter called
Bonaventures, they have entitled all the hundred and fifty Psalms of David to
her; and where he says Lord, they put Lady.

2. Secondly, do they not make an Idol of the Cross of Christ, when they
profess that they worship it cultu latriae? To omit Aquinas and Andradius
alleged by me Conc. 12.
elsewhere, Cap. 49. Asserimus cum sententia communiore and in scholis magis
trita, Crucem colendam esse latria, id est, cultu divino.
Gretzer the Jesuit in his book of the Cross says, We affirm, according to
the more common and received opinion in the Schools, that the Cross of Christ
is to be worshipped with latry, that is, divine worship.

3. Thirdly, do they not make an Idol of the Sacramental bread, or the Host,
as they call it; to which they pray and confess, before which they fall down,
when it is carried in solemn procession on corpus Christi day?

Lastly, do they not make Idols of their Images, and Relics of Sanits,
before which they burn incense, and bow down when they pray, directing their
prayers toward them, and fastening their eyes on them?

Here to stop the mouths of our clamorous adversaries, who traduce us for
nothing more than partiality in handling controversies; I will acquaint you
with the answer they give to the former Bill of enditements.

1. Some of them say, that they worship not the Image, but God by the Image.

2. Others confess, that they worship Images, but deny them to be Idols: to
worship an Idol is idolatry, not to worship an Image, say they.

3. Others salve all with a distinction of dulia and latria; they give dulia to
Saints and their Images, and hyperdulia to the blessed Virgin, but latria only
to God.

But they shall not so evade: for to their first evasion we oppose these
bars: First, that it is idolatry to worship God in, or by an Image. Secondly,
that their learned Clerks of later time maintain, that the image it self is
to be worshipped.


That it is unlawful and offensive to the Highest, to worship him by a proxy,
or set up an image to conveigh honor unto him by it; I evict out of the
fortieth of Esaias, Ver. 18.21. To whom will ye liken God? or what likeness will
you compare him unto? And out of the fourth of Deuteronomy, Ver. 15. Take good
heed therefore unto your selves: for ye saw no manner of similitude in the day
that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb, beware lest you corrupt your selves, and
make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure. Certainly, if God
cannot, if he will not be likened by any thing, he will not like of that
worship which comes to him by or through an image; if it be unlawful to make
an image of God, what suppose you is it to make a god of an Image, by adoring
it in Gods stead? Was not Phoedra an adulteress, when she lay with Hipolytus,
because she protested that she embraced Theseus in him, whom he so near
resembled? Were the Jews that worshipped the Calfe, or they that worshipped
the brazen Serpent, or the image of Baal, free from idolatry? They dare not say
it, because the Spirit of God condemns them for Idolaters; yet they might
plead for themselves, as Papists do, that they worshipped God in the Calfe,
and Christ to come in the Serpent, and him that dwells in a light that cunnot
be approached unto in the image of Baal or the Sun. For they were not such
Calves as to fix their devotion on a Calfe of their own making; they were not
so deceived by the old Serpent, as to attribute divine power to a Serpent of
brass; their eyes were not so dazzled with the beams of the Sun, that they
mistook the Sun for God: No, the words of Exodus 32.5.
Aaron, To morrow is a feast Jehovae, to the Lord: and those of God himself,
Thou Hos. 2.16.
shall call me no more Baal: for I will take away the names of Baalim out of
their mouth; make it a clear case, that they made but a stale of the Image who
bowed down before it, intending the honor to God himself, as Joseph. antiq.
Jud. Jeroboam instituit ut in vitulis Deus coleretur.
Josephus testifies of Jeroboam: Jeroboam, says he, appointed that God
should be worshipped in those Calves which he set up in Dan and Bethel. And
what shall we say, if Papists are indebted to the Heathen for this answer? who
set this varnish upon their idolatrous practice, as you may see in Lact. divin.
institut. l. 2. c. 2. Non simulacra colimus, sed eos ad quorum imaginem sunt
facta.
Lactantius, Tyr. ser. 38. Dicunt se maximum Deum in simulacris colere.
Tyrius, and Clem. constit. Apostol. lib. 1. cap. 6, 7. Aiunt, nos ad honorem
invisibilis Dei, visibil^s Imagines adoramus.
Clemens Romanus. Saint Paul also testifies as much of the Heathen in general
( Romans 1.23.) They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image
made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and to four footed beasts, and to
creeping things. And of the Athenians in particular ( Acts 17.23.) Whom
therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. The greatest God, as
Tyrius speaks, the invisible God, as Clemens, the incorruptible God, as the
Apostle, the God whom Paul preached, the Lord Jehovah is the true God that made
heaven and earth: yet the Jews and Gentiles, who worshipped him by an image,
or according to their own imaginations, in Scripture stand charged with
Idolatry, and for ought appears to the contrary as deeply, as if their
devotion had pitched and settled upon the image of the Calfe, the Serpent, the
Sun, the star Rempham, the similitudes of men, birds, or creeping things,
and not glaunced by them to their Maker. Ye hear that the Papists plea, take
it at the best, is no better than the idolatrous Jews plea, the Priests of
Baals plea, the Gentiles plea: and what if the learnedest of their own side
debar them of this plea also? what if their great Doctors teach, that the
image is to be worshipped for it self, and not only in relation to the
prototypon, as they speak? what if they curse all those who make any scruple
of the veneration of Images? Certainly Cardinal Lib. 2. de Imag. Sanc. c. 21.
Imagines Christi and Sanctorum venerandae sunt, non solum per accidens and
improprie, sed etiam per se and proprie, ita ut ipsae terminent venerationem,
ut in se considerantur, and non solum ut vicem gerunt exemplaris.
Bellarmine his words are plain enough: The Images of Christ and Saints are to
be worshipped not only by accident and improperly, but also by, or for
themselves, and properly in such sort, that they bounded and termined the
worship, as they are considered in themselves, and not only as they stand for
the samplar, that is, the person or thing they represent. This his assertion he
there endeavors to prove out of the second Council of Nice, and the late
Conventicle at Trent, which who so reads, cannot but see that speech of the
Prophet David verified in the Patrons thereof: They that make Images are like
unto them, and so are all they that put their trust in them. To which text
Clemens Alexandrinus, as it seems to me, had an eye, in that his pleasant
allusion, whereby he represents the folly of Idolaters: As (says he) the
natural birds were beguiled by the counterfeit, and flew to the Pigeons that
were drawn in the Painters shop; so natural stocks fly to artificial,
senseless men to senseless Idols. How wardeth the Cardinal off this blow?
after this manner: We have no recourse unto, nor perform any religious
service to any Idol, though we both teach and practice Image Worship. Why?
what is the difference between an Image and an Idol? An Image (says he) is
the representation of something which really subsisteth, as of God, Angel, or
man; but an Idol is the semblance of a thing feigned or imaginary, that has
no being at all, but in the fancy of the deviser. God in the Law forbids us
to worship the later sorts of similitudes, not the former.

Let us try this new coined distinction by the touchstone of Gods Word: How is
it written? Exodus 20.4.
Thou shall not make to thy self Pesell, that is, any thing that is carved or
graven, as not only the interlineary, Vatablus, Tremelius, (...), Sculptile.
and the Septuagint; but the vulgar Latin also, corrected by Sixtus, (...),
Sculpsit, dolavit, Buxtorf. Epit. rad.
and revised by Clemens, render the Hebrew.

Admit that the word Pesel signifies not an Image, as Justin Martyr
translateth it (...), but an Idol, say these first words of the commandment
meet with the worshippers of Idols, not of Images, yet certainly the clause
following (nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the
earth beneath, or in the water under the earth) reaches home to all Images.
For all Images are likenesses of something in heaven, earth, or under the
earth. The Idol of Baal was the likeness of something in heaven, the Calfe of
something on earth, Dagon of something in the waters under the earth. For the
first was the representation and similitude of the Sun, the second of a
Beast, the third of a Fish: yet the Scripture calls these images Idols, and
their worshippers Idolaters: therefore the Papists are in the same damnation
with them, and contradict themselves in terminis, in saying they worship
Images, not Idols. For every Image worshipped is an Idol. True (say the later
Papists) if it be worshipped cultu latriae, with divine worship, not cultu
duliae, which is an inferior kind.

To cut off this third head of Hydra with the sword of the Spirit.

First, we ought not to distinguish where the Law distinguishes not: It is a
good rule in the civil Law, and holds in Divinity; but this distinction of
dulia and latria has no ground in Scripture, where the words dulia and latria
are indifferently used; and as latria is attributed unto men, so dulia to Mat.
4.10. Romans 12.11. Vid. Humfridum in vit. Juel.
God.

Secondly, the Commandment forbids expressly all both inward and outward
worship: all outward in those words; Thou shall not bow down before them: all
inward in the words following, nor worship them. If therefore their dulia imply
either an inward, or an outward worship of the likeness of any thing that is
in the world, it is prohibited in the second Commandment.

Thirdly, if it should be granted them, that there is some difference between
dulia and latria, proper worship and improper, per se and per accidens,
absolute and relative; yet questionless the honest vulgar are not able to
tithe this Mint and Cummin, and cut these scholasticall distinctions to a
hair, their dulia is latria, and latria dulia; and as Comment. in lib. Aug. de
(...). Dei.
Ludovicus vives confessed before they clipped his tongue, they exhibit a like
manner of devotion to Saints, and their Images and Relics, to that which the
Heathen did to their gods and goddesses.

Fourthly, all worship is either civil or religious; to perform civil
worship to Images, as if they were our concives, is ridiculous: to yield
religious, is impious. If by cultus duliae they mean civil complement, they
must show what familiarity or civil society the living have with the dead, and
what courtesy their Images can return back again. Indeed we read of an
Image of our Lady that Doctor Andrews resp. ad apol. Bellar. Obvertit ei
posteriora.
turned her back parts to a Carthusian that came tardy to Mattens; but never
of any that performed any complement before. No civil respect therefore is due
to any Image, and much less religious: for Saint Lib. 14. cont. Faus. Maniche.
Austin teaches expressly, that the Apostle forbids any worship of religion
to be given to a creature.

Lastly, the Jesuits and Schoolmen before alleged teach, that the Image of
God, and of Christ, and of the Cross; and all Papists teach, that the elements
of bread and wine after consecration in the Sacrament, are to be worshipped
cultu latriae, or with divine worship. Therefore notwithstanding all their
slips and evasions, the second Commandment takes hold of them, and Gods
fearful judgment against Idolaters will seize on them also, if they avert
them not by turning from dead Images to the living God.

I will cut off the thread of my discourse with Aristotle his sharp censure of
the Milesians, Aristot. politic.
(...), The Milesians are not fools, yet they do just the same things which
fools do: even so though we forbear to fasten the name of Heathenish
Idolaters upon Papists; yet surely they do the same things as they did.

First, the Heathen carried their gods of gold and silver Baruch 6.4.
upon their shoulders; so do the Papists bear out their Images and Relics,
enclosed in chasses of gold and silver, in their solemn procession on high
days.

Secondly, the Heathen decked their Images, as if they were men and women, with
apparel (yet cannot these gods save themselves from rust and moth, though
they be Ver. 11.
covered with purple raiment) and who knows not that Papists put costly
apparel on their Images? almost every Saint among them has his holy day and
working day suit.

Thirdly, the Heathen lighted candles before their Images, Ver. 19.
though the Image sees not one of them: and do not Papists set tapers before
theirs?

Fourthly, the faces of the Heathen Idols were blacked with Ver. 21.
smoke: so are the Popish Images with the fume of the incense they burn to
them.

Fifthly, the Heathen Ver. 41.
spoke to their Idols as if they were able to understand them: so do the
Papists to the wood of the Cross; Ave lignum spes unica.

Sixthly, the Heathenish Priests beards and heads were Ver. 31.
shaven: and so are our Popish Priests crowns.

Seventhly, Baals Clergy (if I may so speak) was divided into Priests and
Chemarims, so termed for the black attire they ware: so is the Popish into
Seminary Priests and Jesuits, birds of the same feather with the Chemarims.

Eighthly, the Heathen about the Polid. virg. de invent. rerum. l. 1. c. 5.
calends of February visited all their Temples with lights: a like ceremony the
Papists use at Candlemasse.

Ninthly, at the beginning of the Spring the Heathen kept their Hilaria feasts,
in which it was lawful to revel and riot in all kinds of disorder: in place
whereof the Papists have brought in their Carnivals about the same time.

Tenthly, the Heathen commended every City and Village to the protection of
some god or goddess: Juno was Lady guardian of Carthage, Venus of Cyprus,
Diana of Ephesus, Pallas of Athens, etc. and have not the Papists likewise
multiplied their Saints according to the number of their Cities? and do they
not share the patronages of them between them? Does not Venice fall to Saint
Marks lot? Paris to Saint Genoviefe's? Spain to Saint James's? France to
Saint Dennises? Scotland to Saint Andrews? Ireland to Saint Patrickes? England
to Saint Georges?

Eleventhly, the Heathen assigned several offices to several gods, calling
upon Ceres for corn, upon Bacchus for wine, upon Aesculapius for health, upon
Mercury for wealth, Apollo for wisdom, etc. In like manner the Papists
address themselves to particular Saints upon particular and special
occasions; to Saint Genoviefe for rain, to Saint Marc^an for fair weather,
Saint Michael in battle, Saint Nicholas in a sea tempest, Saint Eustace in
hunting, Saint Roch and Sebastian for remedies against the plague, Saint Raphel
against catarres, Saint Apollonia against the toothache, St. Anthony against
inflammations, Saint Margaret for safe delivery in childe-birth, and to other
Saints upon other occasions, as if God had granted a kind of Monopoly of the
sev^rall commodities of this life to several Saints.

Twelfthly, will you have yet more? Hercules has left his club to Saint
Christopher, Janus has resigned up his keys to Saint Peter, Lucina her office
of midwife to Saint Margaret, the Muses their instruments of music to
Cecilia, and Jupiter Hammon his horns to Moses.

Sentio me jam de faece haurire, I now draw very low, the very lees and dregs
of Popery, which whosoever sucketh, unless he cast them up again by
repentance, is like to sup up the dregs of the vial of Gods wrath. And now
(me thinks) I see the Son of man look upon some of the reformed Churches
with eyes sparkling like fire, and stamping with his brazen feet, to see these
abominations of Jezebel winked at as they are in so many places. I meddle not
here with any deliberation of State, fitter for the Council Table than the
Pulpit: but discover to every private Christian what his duty is, to refrain
from the society of Idolaters; and I beseech them for the love of him, who has
espoused their souls to himself, and has decked them with the richest jewels
of his grace, and made them a joynter of his Kingdom, to beware that they be
not enticed to spiritual fornication, to forbear the company of all those who
solicit them in this kind: nay farther, to detect such persons to authority,
that they may learn not to blaspheme the truth of our Religion, nor seduce his
Majesty's subjects from their allegiance to the Prince, and conformity to his
Laws. Pliny writes of certain Plin. not. hist. l. 8 c. 15. Indiginis
innoxii, peregrinos interimunt.
Efts in Tyrinth, and Snakes in Syria, that do no hurt to the natives, but
sting strangers to death: it may be some have the like conceit of our English
Seminary Priests and Jesuits, who have done so great mischief beyond the Sea,
that they have no power or will to hurt any here at home; and therefore dare
more boldly converse with them, because their outward carriage is fair. But I
beseech them to consider that the Panther hides her ougly visage, which she
knows will terrify the beasts from coming near her, alluring them with the
sweet smell of her body; but as soon as they come within her reach, she
makes a prey of them. Therefore as you tender the salvation of your body and
soul, your estate in this life, and the life to come, take heed how you play
at the hole of the Cockatrice, and familiarly converse with the great Whore, or
any of her Minions, lest they draw you to naughtiness and spiritual
lewdness. Have no part with them that have no part in God, or have part with
abominable Idols. If the good Bishop Saint Ambrose, being commanded by
Valentinian the Emperor to deliver up a Church in his Diocese to the Arrians,
gave this answer, That he would first yield up his life: Prius est ut vitam
mihi Imperator, quam fidem adimat: shall we give up our souls, which are the
Temples of the living God, to Idolatrous worship? If Saint John the Evangelist
would not stay in the bath with Cerinthus the Heretic; shall we dare freely
to partake with worser Heretics in the pledges of salvation, and wash our
souls with them in the royal bath of Christ's blood? Ambros. ep. 37. Pollui se
putabat, si Aram vidisset: ferend^mve est, ut Gentilis sacrificet Christianus
intersit?
Constantius the Emperor thought himself polluted, if he had but seen an
Heathenish Altar; and Saint Ambrose proposes it as a thing most absurd and
intolerable, that a Christian should be present at the sacrifices of the
Heathen. Our Savior in this place, and Saint 1 Cor. 10.
Paul in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, would not have Christians to
eat any of those things that were sacrificed unto Idols: Nay, the Prophet
Psalm. 16.4.
David professes, that he will not so much as name an Idol: Their offerings of
blood will I not offer, nor make mention of their names in my lips.

I end, and seal up my meditations upon these words spoken to an Angel, with
the words spoken by an Apoc. 14.9.
Angel: If any worship the Beast and his Image, and receive his mark in his
forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of
God, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy Angels
and the Lamb: and the smoke of their torments shall ascend for ever and ever.
And they shall have no rest neither day nor night, which worship the Beast and
his Image, and whosoever receives the print of his name.

Gracious Lord, who gracest the Ministers of the Gospel with the title of
Angels, make them in their knowledge and life angelical: keep them not only
from sins of omission and commission, but also from sins of permission;
that all may see their works, and their love, and their service, and their
faith, and their patience; their love of thee, and their service to thee, and
their faith in thee, and their patience for thee, and their growth in all these
graces, and that thou may have nothing against them. And since thou have
displayed the Romish Jezebel unto us by her three marks, of imposture,
impurity, and idolatry, breed in us all a greater loathing and detestation of
her abominations: preserve us by the sincere preaching of the Word, and
powerful operation of thy Spirit, that we be neither deceived by her
imposture, to believe her false prophesies, neither defiled in our body by her
impurity, to commit fornication, nor in soul by her idolatry, to eat things
sacrificed unto Idols.

Behold here in Aarons breast plate all those and many more precious stones, in
all twelve, bearing the name of the twelve Patriarchs, set in ouches of gold,
and tied to the golden rings of the Ephod, a sacred vestment which Aaron and
his successors were to put on before they gave judgment, when the people
asked counsel of God. So much of the pectorall is clearly set down in this
book: but that Aarons breast plate of judgment was a perfect astrolab is but
Abenezra his fantasy without judgment, refuted by Tostatus. Likewise, that
together with the names of the Patriarchs there was engraven in every stone the
name of some Star or Angel, ut confirmaretur memoria tribus apud Deum, is but
a muddie talmuddie tradition, implying ridiculously and impiously, that God
needs or uses the helps of artificial memory. Antiq. Judaic. l. 3. c. 9.
Per duodecimas gemmas quas in pecto^^^ ^ontifex insu^^^ (...) in bello
^^^toriam Deus pronunciare solebat. Nam priusquam exercitus se moveret, tantus
fulgor ex iis emicabat, ut toti populo facile innotesceret adesle Deum, opemque
iis esse allaturum.
Josephus tells us a fair tale (and Baronius graceth his annals with it) of
an unusual and mavelous lightning of some of these gemmes, which clearly
foreshewed victory to the people when they asked counsel of God by the Ephod,
before they went into war: a strange kind of prophetical illumination, not
by the irradiation of the Spirit into their minds, but by the scintillation
and luster of stones to the eye. But the Scriptures silence in a matter of such
note, and Josephus his own confession, that for the space of two hundred
years before his time there was no such new kind of soothsaying (not by the
aspect of the heavens, but of the Priests breast, not by twinkling stars,
but by sparkling stones) gives us just cause to suspect the truth of this
narration; and much more of an appendix thereunto which we find in Suidas and
Epiphanius, that the Diamond in the second row of stones, as it clearly
foreshewed victory by the extraordinary glare of it; so it portended bloody
slaughter by suddenly turning into a red color, and final desolation by
changing into black. For in the book of Judges we have the manner of Gods
revealing future events to the Priests when they had on the linen Ephod, set
down not by mute signs, but by created voice; and therefore St. Qu. 117. in
Exodus
Austine accounts the former relation to be a mere fable: Fabulantur quidam
lapidem fuisse, cujus color, sive ad prospera, sive ad adversa, mutaretur.
Howbeit, since the Ca. 18. v. 24.
Author of the book of wisdom affirms, that the glory, or, as others
translate, the memorable acts of the patriarchs were engraven in the four
rows of stones, whether in the choice of these jewels, respect were not had to
such as fittest resembled by their beauty or virtue something memorable
concerning the Patriarch, or his posterity whose name it bare, I determine not
absolutely on either side. First, because neither the Jewish nor the Christian
Interpreters agree in the reckoning of the stones, or the order of the
Patriarchs names engraven in them. The Thargum of Jerusalem and the Chaldee
Paraphrase express them after this manner: Upon the 1 Sardine, was graven 1
Reuben, Sons of Leah. 2 Topaze, 2 Simeon, 3 Smaragd, 3 Levi, 4 Chalcedonie, 4
Judah, 5 Saphir, 5 Issachar, 6 Sardonyx, 6 Zabulon, 7 Hyacinth, 7 Dan, Of
Bilhah Rachels maid. 8 Chrysoprase, 8 Napthali, 9 Amethyst, 9 Gad, Of Zilpha
Leahs maid. 10 Chrysolite, 10 Asher, 11 Beryll, 11 Joseph, Of Rachel. 12
Jasper, 12 Benjamin.

Others differ in translation of the stones, and conceive the names of the
Patriarchs to have been graven in them according to the order of nature;
according to which after Judah they place Dan, and then Napthali after Gad,
then Asher after Issachar, then Zabulon, then Joseph and Benjamin.

The Author of the vulgar translation, which the Council of Trent defines to
be authentical, thus ranketh the stones in the four rows: In the first, 1
Sardius. 2 Topazius. 3 Smaragdus.
In the second, 4 Carbunculus. 5 Saphirus. 6 Jaspis.
In the third, 7 Ligyrius. 8 Achates. 9 Amethystus.
In the fourth, 10 Chrysolitus. 11 Onychinus. 12 Beryllus.



The Kings Translatours thus: In the first, 1 Sardius. 2 Topaze. 3 Carbuncle.
In the second, 4 Emrald. 5 Sapphire. 6 Diamond.
In the third, 7 Alygure. 8 Agate. 9 Amethyst.
In the fourth, 10 Beryll. 11 Onyx. 12 Jasper.



Secondly, because Aben Ezra a great Rabbin ingenuously confesses, that there
is no certainty to be had of these stones and their distinction: because Gehon
interprets them Kirtsono at his pleasure; neither is there extant any
tradition in their Cabala concerning them: yet because we may have undoubted
certainty of most of them, either from their names in the Hebrew or Chaldee, as
of the Saphir, Turkeys, and Jasper; or from their etymologies, or by comparing
them with the twelve precious stones mentioned in the Apocalypse: and because
the rows and stones in them may serve for places and Images in artificial
memory, to imprint more firmly in our mind some remarkable story of the
Patriarchs, whose names were engraven in them, I will observe some congruities
between them.

1 The first precious stone is the Sardius, Sardonix, or Rubinus, in Hebrew
Odem, ab Adam, signifying red earth, in English a Rubie; and the first son of
Jacob, whose name by the consent of all was engraven in it, was Reuben. Behold
Reuben in a Rubie. And as their names, so their qualities agree: a Rubie is an
orient jewel, and Reuben is called the Genesis 49.3.
excellency of dignity: yet the goodliest and most glorious Rubie, says
Comment. in Exodus
Ystella, nubecula quadam offunditur, is over-shadowed with some cloud: so was
Reubens glory, as it follows ver. 4. Thou shall not be excellent, because
thou wentest up to thy fathers bed. A Rubie in Latin is called Carneolus, in
Greek (...), quasi (...), because it is of the color of flesh: and did not
Reuben deserve the name of Carneolus, when he had carnal society with his
fathers Concubine?

2 The second stone is the Topaze; so the Seventy, Saint Jerome, Josephus,
Junius, and all the Transl^tours of note whom I have seen, render the Hebrew
(...): to whose authority I add a conjecture out of Geogr. l. 6.
Strabo, where he makes mention of a precious stone found in the Island called
Ophias, near the Eastern Aethiopia, now called the country of the Abyssens.
This jewel he calls (...), from the great search made for it, even by the
Kings of Egypt, who, as he there says, hired great multitudes to seek for it
in all places of the Island; and that after they found store of them, the
Island changed his name, and was called Topazium: which testimony of this
Heathen Historiographer is somewhat confirmed by the words of Job 28.19. The
Topaze of Aethiopia shall not equal it.
Job, Non aequabitur ei Topazius Aethiopiae; Hebr. Phitdah cush. The Topaze is
a Gemme (as the Naturalists describe it) in the day time between a green and
yellow, but in the night of a fiery color, which well resembles the fiery
Genesis 49.6, 7. Jud. 9.2.
rage of Simeon, the second son of Jacob, whose name was engraven in it.

3 The third stone is an Emrald, in the Chaldee is Smaragden, in the Arabic
Zamrad, in Greek (...), in Latin Smaragdus, in Hebrew (...) derived from
Baraq, Barqueth.
signifying to lighten, because this stone resembles lightning out of a thick
cloud; or, as Buxtorfius affirms, a fulgore, from the luster of it, which
more delights the eye than the splendor of any other precious stones,
because it is a perfect green stone, and does not dazzle the eye as others, but
comfort it rather. Comment. in Exodus
Borrhaeus writes of it, that it is a great cooler and preserver of chastity:
he reports also (I know not how truly) that being worn upon the finger of
an unclean person, in flagrante crimine fractus legitur, it brake suddenly, as
a Venice glass with poison. Which may put us in mind, as of the special act
of Genesis 34.27.
Levi (whose name was engraven in this stone) mentioned in revenging his
sisters rape upon the Sechemites, so in general of chastity, of all men best
becoming the Levites. Moreover, in that an Emrald glasse-like represents the
shape of all things before it, and therefore Nero, as Not. hist. l. 36. c. 5.
Gladiatorum pugnas spect^bat Smaragdo.
Pliny writes, beheld all Pageants and Fencers prizes through his Emrald, we
may take occasion to remember St. Peter's exhortation to Pastors, who are the
Levites of the Gospel, to be 1. Pet. 5.3.
(...), samplars to their flock, and in their lives to represent the perfect
shapes of all virtues.

4 The fourth stone, according to Junius, is a Chrysoprasus or Chrysolite, in
Hebrew Nophek, from (...) to blow or breathe, because, as De Gem.
Rueus writes, this Gemme has a singular virtue in helping the breathing
parts, and curing those that are short breathed; but the Radicals in (...) are
not the same with those in Naphach; in the one the last Radical is Cheth
(...), in the other it is Caph (...), and therefore I rather render the word
with the Geneva Translatours, and Josephus, and Diction Heb. ex rad. David.
^imhi.
Munster, the Carbuncle; because the Seventy render it (...), and St. Ezekiel
28.13.
Jerome, excellently learned in the Hebrew, Carbunculus. This Gemme is of a red
color, glowing like a coal, with a streake of milk drawn circle-wise about
it, (as the expert Naturalists describe it) which well agrees with that we
read of Judah, Genesis 49.11, 12.
whose name was engraven in this stone; He washes his garments in the blood
of the grape, his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
Moreover, it is prophesied of Judah, that he should give the law to his
brethren, and make them take up and bear his yoke: and Rueus observes out of
Aristotle, concerning the Carbuncle, quod solus possit figuram suam aliis
Gemmis imprimere, that the Carbuncle alone, if he be put by other precious
stones, imprints his color and form in them.

5. The fifth stone is a Saphir, which retains his name for ought appears in
all languages, in Latin Saphirus, in Greek (...), in Hebrew (...) from (...),
to number or write, because this gemme is the aptest of any to be engraven on;
and it is a tradition amongst the Jews, that the stones in which God wrote the
Commandments were Saphirs. The Saphirs of the richest kind are of an azure
color, like that Serpent to which Genesis 49.17.
Dan is compared (whose name was engraven in this stone) Dan shall be a Serpent
by the way, a Snake by the path. Dioscorides says, the Saphir is a special
cordial, which may have some reference to the haughty courage of Deuteronomy. 33.22.
Dan is as a Lions whelp.
Dan: of whom it is also prophesied, Dan shall Genesis 49.16.
judge his people. And in the vision of Cap. 1. V. 26.
Ezekiel, The likeness of the Throne of judgment is said to be as the
appearance of a Saphir stone.

6. The sixth stone, according to the author of the vulgar Latin, which all
Papists hold for authentical, is Jaspis, the Jasper stone; but this is an
apparent error: for it is confessed on all sides, that in all the four ranks
the stones were several, as likewise were the twelve Patriarchs, whose names
were engraven in them: but the Jasper is the last stone in the fourth row, in
the Hebrew Jasphe: Therefore the third stone in the second row cannot be the
Jasper. What stone then was it? in all probability the Diamond, as the Seventy
and Josephus render it, and Aben Ezra and Jahalom Adamas lapis pretiosus sic
dictus, quod pertundit ac confringit omnes alios lapides, ut notat Aben Ezra.
Exodus 28.18.
Buxtorfius prove it from the Hebrew etymology, (...) from (...), the word in
the Hebrew signifies a stone that is stronger than all other, and will break
them in pieces. In this stone was the name of Naphthali written, who was so
named by Genesis 30.8.
Rachel, because she got the upper hand of her sister: With great wrastlings
have I wrastled with my sister, and I have prevailed, and she called his name
Naphthali. Moreover, we read a prophecy in the land of Esaias 9.1.
Naphthali, that the people which sat in darkness should see a great light,
which was Matthew. 4.15, 16.
fulfilled in our Saviors preaching there: now what fitter jewel in the world
to prefigure and show forth this wonderful great light than the Diamond, which
is incomparably the brightest of all precious stones?

Thus I might parallel the twelve stones, and the twelve Patriarchs; but to
avoid saciety, and meet with your expectation, I leave that task, and observe
only for the present, that the names of the twelve Patriarchs, which were
engraven at large in these jewels shining on the breast plate of Aaron, were
engraven again in a lesser character in the two Onyx stones on his shoulder;
which is both a warrant for, and an emblem of my present work, which must be a
repetition and contraction of those precious doctrines, which before you saw
expressed by the four Preachers in diverse methods and styles, as it were in
diverse rows, with the point of diverse Diamonds. It is very probable also, that
the self same stones, as Saint Ep. 28. Ezekiel. 28.13.
Jerome observes, decked the crown of the King of Tire, and are laid in the
foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem: which may teach us, that precious
doctrines and observations, like so many jewels, may be again and again
presented to your spiritual view. Were I to vindicate this exercise from the
often repeated cavells against repetitions, I would answer them as Martial does
those who carped at him for handling the same subject twice, and falling upon
like conceits: Mart. epigr. lib. 1.
Lascivos leporum cursus, lususque leonum,
Quod major nobis charta minorque gerit:
Et bis idem facimus: nimium si, Stella, videtur
Hoc tibi; bis leporem tu quoque pone mihi.
But to you, my beloved and much reverenced brethren, I allege for my apology
the example not only of the Gentiles at Act. 13.42.
Antiochia, who besought the Apostles to preach unto them the same words the
next Sabbath: and of Saint Philip. 3.1.
Paul, whom it grieved not to write to the Philippians the same things: but
also of our Savior Christ, who in his prayer Mat. 26.44.
repeated the third time the same words; and John 17. often quavereth upon that
sweet close, I in them, and they in me; and, that they may be one, as thou
and I are one. It is Cic. de orat. l. 1. Subacto opus est solo nec novato
duntaxat, sed and iterato.
not once plowing, but the often breaking up of the earth which makes it
fruitful; nor is it the incident, but the reflected beam of the Sun that
gives the greatest heat: in which consideration, they who have performed this
great task before me, might receive great warmth of comfort, because the
light of heavenly doctrine incident upon their memories, like the beams of the
Sun upon glass or other polite bodies, were reverberated from them per
radium reflexum, and thereby received greater virtue: but now the same cast
back from my fluid and waterish memory per radium refractum, cannot but lose
much of their light and grace. The brighter the color is, the more duskie the
shadow must needs be; the perfecter the discourse, the more imperfect and
difficult the epitomie: for in all such the thronging the parts is the wronging
the whole, and contraction can be no better than detraction. Had these learned
Sermons been like Vines, that run into many superfluous stemmes, I might
conceive some hope by pruning them, to effect that for which Saint Jerome
commends the Athenian Orators, Ep. ad Rustic.
Ut eloquentiae torcularia, non verborum pampinis, sed sensuum quasi uvarum
expressionibus redundarent: but these were rather like the rows of precious
stones in my Text. Now concerning such, the rule of the Jewellers is, If there
be any grain, cloud, or specke in a gemme, which cannot be ground out without
sensible abating the stone, not to meddle with it, because the loss in the
matter being so precious, cannot be recompensed with any beauty that art can
give.

The first of them, for the fair blossoms of eloquence in it, and the Authors
flourishing style, deserves the name of terra florida in America.

The second, for the happy plenty of all things in it, the name of the
fortunatae Insulae. Reddit ubi cererem tellus inarata quotannis,
and imputata floret usque vinea:
Germinat, and nunquam fallentis terms olivae,
suamque pulla ficus ornat arborem.
Or rather of Not. hist. l. 18. Ubi palmae praegrandi subditur olea, huic
ficus, fico punica, illi vitis, sub vite seritur frumentum, mox legumen, deinde
olus, omnia eodem anno.
Tocape in Pliny, wherein under a fair palm tree you may see an olive, under
an olive a fig tree, under a fig tree a vine, under a vine corn, under
corn all manner of wholesome herbs, all growing in one year; so that if as it
was demanded of Porus, how he would be dealt withal, it were of me how I would
have an argument handled in a Sermon; my answer should be the same with that
Indian king Porus, Regio more; in eo enim insunt omnia. Allus. ad Nomen sec
concionat. Angl. King.


The third I know no better country to compare unto, than terra de Labradora in
the west Indies, in regard of the accurate and elaborate composition.

The fourth may be fitly termed Promontorium bonae spei, Cape of good hope.
not so much in respect of the hopeful parts of the speaker, as the subject of
his discourse, which was the promise of our Savior, I will ease you. This
indeed is Caput bonae spei, the only Cape of good hope.

If these allusions seem defective, and not so apposite; as before I searched
the land, so now I will the sea for fitter, and the fittest of all seem to me
to be these four seas: 1. Rubrum, 2. Orientale. 3. Mediterraneum. 4. Pacificum.


The first, because it ran all upon the bloody passion of our Savior, I liken
to the read sea.

The second I compare to the oriental Ocean, not only in respect of the
immensity of matter in it, depth of the authors judgment, and rare pearls of
wit and art; but especially, because Extulit Oceano caput aureus igniferum sol.
because out of this Eastern Ocean we saw the Sun of righteousness, Christ Jesus
arising.

The third, because it interveyned between the former and the latter sea, and
passed through the whole continent in a manner of Divinity, I call the
Mediterranean or mid-land sea.

The fourth, for the equal current of it, but especially for the subject and
matter, resembles mare del zur, commonly called Pacificum: for his whole
discourse tended to this, that though the life of a Christian be a sea, yet
that it is so calmed by Christ's promise, I will ease you, that to every child
of God in the end it proves mare pacificum. My peace I give unto you, The still
sea.
be not troubled, nor fear; Et si vultis accipere, these judicious and
methodicall Sermons, four in number, are the four rows in Aarons
breast plate of judgment, the jewels are their precious doctrines, the
imbossments of gold, in which these jewels were set, were their texts of
Scripture: Sed ubi spiritualis tabernaculi Vincent. Lerin. advers. haer.
Bezaliel, qui pretiosas divini dogmatis gemmas exculperet fideliter, adornaret
sapienter, adjiceret gratiam, splendorem, venustatem? I know not how it comes
to pass, that as sometimes in Israel, though there were much metal, yet no
Smith; so at this time in this famous University, though we have store of
jewels, yet there is none who will profess himself in this kind a Jeweller. If
the true reason hereof be the difficulty and danger of this work, wherein we
fish as it were with a golden hook, Cujus jactura nulla piscium captura
compensari potest: then have all sorts of auditors great reason favorably to
interpret their best endeavors, who for their sake not only undertake so great
a task, but hazard so great a loss. If the Rehearser acquit himself never so
well, what can he expect for all his pains but the bare commendation of a good
memory? but if he fail, not only his memory, but his judgment and discretion
also are called in question. In which consideration, when authority first laid
hands on me, I drew back with all my might, till the command for repeating
being repeated again and again, in the end the power of authority more
prevailed with me, than the sense of mine own infirmity; Adamas ferrum a
magnete tractum ad se rapit vehementius, though the iron, as Agricola
observes, is drawn powerfully by the lodestone; yet if a diamond be in place,
the lodestone loses his force.

Artificial memory, as Lib. 3. Rhet. ad Heren. Constat artificiosa memoria ex
locis and imaginibus.
Cornificius says, consists of images and places. We need not go far for
them, we have them both in my Text, places, Ver. 17. Thou shall set it full of
places for stones; and images most resplendent in the Verses following: and
very happy were I, if as here I have the names, so I had the natural effects
attributed to some of these jewels: for, 1. The Agat keeps a man moist, says
Dioscorides. 2. The Beril sharpeneth the wit, says Ystella. 3. The Carbuncle
infuseth spirits, says Barraeus. 4. The Chrysolite helps the breathing
parts, says Rueus. 5. The Emrald is good for the sight and memory, says
Vincentius. 6. The Onyx strengthens the whole body, says Albertus. 7. The
Saphir freeth a man from wrath and envy, says Tostatus.
but I persuade my self, that many of these authors, when they wrote these
things, had an Amethyst on their fingers, the last jewel in the third row, in
Hebrew called, from. Buxtorf. epit. radic. heb. From a word signifying to
dream, because they that wear it are much subject to dreaming.
Amethystus lapis pretiosus, sic dictus, quod gestantibus eum somnia inducit,
and therefore leaving such incredulous relations to Aben Ezra in Exodus 28.19.
Rabbinicall and Philosophical legends, in a warrantable Scripture phrase I
will pray to Almighty God, to touch my tongue with a coal mentioned by the
Esaias 6.6, 7. Then flew one of the Seraphims unto me, having a coal in his
hand, and he laid it upon my tongue.
Prophet Esaias, which S. Jerome interprets a Carbuncle, that I may inflame the
hearts of this great assembly with a zeal of his glory, and both now, and
whenever I am to speak to the edification of his people; so to furnish me
with materials, and assist me in laying them, that upon the true foundation
Christ Jesus, I may build not hay and stubble, but gold, silver, and precious
stones, such as shine in my Text; which I divide according to the four rows
into four parts.

THE FIRST ROW.
And in the first row a Ruby, a Topaze, and an Emrald.
WHether the Ruby fit not the modesty of the Speaker; the Topaze, quae sola
gemmarum limam sentit, his limate and polished style; the Emrald the fresh and
green verdour of his sentences, I leave to your learned censures: sure I am,
the green and ruddy stones, some of them generated in the red sea, lively set
forth the green wounds and bloody passion of the worlds Redeemer, the subject
of his discourse. The Ruby has a perfect color of flesh, whence it is called
in Latin Carneolus; but with a luster and resplendency far above the nature
of flesh. What fitter emblem of the rays of divine majesty shining in the
flesh of our Savior? which was the argument of the Preachers first part. This
Ruby nubecula quadam offundebatur (as the natural) to wit, in his passion, and
then changed color, and resembled the other two gems, death displaying its
colors in his flesh, which he suffered to pay the wages of sin for us; which
was the scope of his latter observations. The imbossment of gold, in which
these gems of divine doctrine were set, was his Text taken out of

JOHN 11.50. It is expedient for us, that one man should dye for the people.
The first Sermon preached on Good Friday by Master Ozborstone Student of
Christ-Church.



BEhold, I bring you a prophecy, but of no Prophet; I present you lying malice
speaking truth, unwittingly, unwillingly, and savage cruelty providing a salve
to cure the wounds of all mankind. Out of one fountain bitter and sweet, out of
one field tares and wheat, out of one mouth proceeds cursing and blessing.
Behold an ambitious simoniacall Priest of the Roman constitution, and that but
for a year, vaunt over him that is a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek. Behold bloody Caiphas consulting, nay determining to put Christ to
death, not for any fault of his, but because it was profitable to the Priests
(it is expedient for us): yet does he color his bloodthirsty appetite with a
varnish of common good: If we let him alone, all men will believe in him, and
believing him to be a God, will advance him to be a King, and the Romans will
come and take away this place and our Nation. He is but one man, what is the
blood of one man to the quiet of a public state? Melius est ut pereat unus,
quam unitas, let one man dye, that the whole Nation perish not. This is Caiphas
his meaning: vouchsafe we a look to it, before we consider the meaning of a
much better spirit. Solomon his Lilly is most beautiful among thorns. The
Rose, says Plutarch, is never so fragrant, as when it is planted by the
Nettle: the doctrine of the Holy Ghost seems never more excellent, than when
it is compared with the doctrine of Devils. It is expedient he should dye, he
says not it is just or lawful: Bonum commodis non honestate metitur. Caiphas
profit is become the rule of justice; in whose hands now it is not only to
judge according to the rule of law, but to overruled the law also. In imitation
of whom I verily think it was, that Clemens the fifth being demanded how the
Templer Knights might be cut off, made this answer, Si non licet per viam
justitiae, licet saltem per viam expedientiae.

But if it be profitable, to whom, cui bono? to whom is it so? to us: now he
speaks like himself. To S. Paul all things were lawful, yet many things did
not seem expedient: to Caiphas that is expedient which is not lawful. But
shall a just innocent man, a Prophet, nay more than he that was more than a
Prophet, lose his life for nothing but your commodity? the answer is, that
though he be all these, yet in a manner he is but unus, one man, and we are
many; better it were that he suffer a mischief, than we an inconvenience;
therefore be his quality what it may be, let him dye. Ne saevi magne Sacerdos:
Let not the high Priest be angry; will nothing but his death appease you? You
have a guard, keep him sure, manacle his hands, fetter his feet, only spare his
life, bring not his blood upon your head. Tush, it is for our profit, His blood
be upon us. Thus crudelitas vertitur in voluptatem, and jam occidere hominem
juvat, it was meat and drink to them to spill the blood of Christ Jesus; and
being pleased to consider him but as a man, they trampled on him as a worm and
no man. Ystel. in Exodus
Behold here in another sense Caiphas a bloody Ruby; yet, as the Rubies about
Egypt aurea bractea sublinuntur, so has he gold foil Scripture in his mouth,
the words of the Holy Ghost, who not only out of the mouth of babes and
sucklings will have his praise, out of the mouth of asses and brute beasts will
have his power to be known; but also out of the mouth of reprobates and
incarnate devils will have the same truth in the same words confirmed, which
holy Prophets, and the holy Spirit, by which they spoke, would have revealed.
For not only holy men (as the Preacher observed) but sometimes also unholy men
speak as they are moved by the Holy Ghost: Agit Spiritus Dei, and per bonos,
and per malos, and per scientes, and per nescientes quod agendum novit, and
statuit; but in a different manner. The Holy Ghost so touched the hearts of
holy Prophets, that their hearts enditing this matter of Christ's passion, their
tongues became the pen of ready writers: but on the contrary, as Caiphas did
honor God with his lips, while his heart was far from him; so (says Saint
Chrysostom) the Spirit of God touched his lips, but came not near his heart.
(It is expedient.) In the exposition of Caiphas, the meaning is, it is good for
us pretending common good, to kill Jesus; but the sense of the Holy Ghost is,
that the precious death of our Savior would be expedient for us, and his alone
blood once shed for his people an all-sufficient ransom for their souls.

Expedient it was, and behoovefull in the first place, that he who should
satisfy for sin (the wages whereof is death) should be a man subject to
death. Secondly, that he should dye. Thirdly, inasmuch as with respect to his
people he became a man subject to death; so that he should in the end lay
down his life for the people. Fourthly, that he should be sufficient by his
alone death to satisfy in their behalf, for whom he dyed. Lastly, we must
enquire whether the profit of his passion be such as extends to our selves,
or not; we shall find it does: for so are the words of the Text, It is
expedient for us.

Expedient it was that the Savior of man should be a man, Ecce homo, behold he
is so: for coming to save man, suscepit naturam quam judicavit salvandam, he
became in all things, sin only excepted, like unto us. It was fit it should
be so; for if the Deity had opposed it self, non tam ratio quam potestas
Diabolum vicisset, what mystery had there bin for God to vanquish the Devil?
how should the Scripture have bin fulfilled, The seed of the woman shall break
the Serpents head? yet there is an experiment beyond all this, Experiar Deus
hic discrimine aperto an sit mortalis, says the spiritual Lycaon; if he
carry about with him (...), a body subject to dissolution, doubtless he is a
man. Thus therefore that he might show himself a man, it was expedient that
he should die. Is this thy reward, O sweet Savior, for stouping thine
infinite majesty so low as to become earth, and thirty three years to converse
amongst us, must thou dye? It must be so, yet not for any necessity of justice
in respect of himself; for never Lamb more innocent: nor of constraint; for
at the very time of his apprehension, when he had less than twelve Apostles,
he had more than twelve Legions of Angels at his beck; at the breath of his
mouth, the majesty of his countenance, the force of those his words, I am he,
a whole troop of his persecuters fell backwards: but it must be so, because
the determination of the Trinity, and the conformity of his own will thereunto
will have it so: Oblatus est quia voluit (says the Prophet:) I lay down my
life (says himself:) Yea, Caiphas said as much in effect, It is meet, not
that one should be put to death, but that he should dye: Mori infirmitatis est,
sic mori virtutis infinitae. There wanted not other means to redeem man, but
(...), it was meet, that by the death of the Son of God we should be
redeemed: Sanguine quaerendi reditus animaque litandum. No escaping the stroke
of the Angel, but by sprinkling the Lambs life blood: no means to return
from exile, till the death of the high Priest. Must he dye then? and are the
Scriptures so strait in this point? O death, how bitter is thy remembrance?
witness our Savior: Si fieri potest, transeat hic calix; but since for the
reasons before named that was neither possible nor expedient, since dye he
must, what death does the Holy Ghost think to be most expedient? If he may
not yield to nature, as a ripe apple falls from the tree, but must be plucked
thence, there are deaths no less honorable than violent: shall he dye an
honorable death? No, he must be reckoned among the malefactors, and dye a
shameful death. In shameful deaths there is a kind of (...), rid him quickly
out of his pain: Misericordiae genus est cito occidere. No, that was not
expedient, Feri ut se sentiat mori, it was expedient that he should dye a
tedious and most painful death, wherein a tract of lingering misery and
lasting torment was to be endured: What death is that? I need not amplify;
even by the testimony of the Holy Ghost the death of the Cross was for the
torture most grievous, for the shame most infamous: He humbled himself, and
became obedient unto death. Could his humility go on one step further? Yes,
one step, even to the death of the Cross, that is a death beyond death; the
utmost and highest of all punishments, says Ulpian: Having in it the extent of
torture, says Apuleius: The quintessence of cruelty, says the Roman Orator.
It is not amiss to know the manner of the execution of this death. First,
after sentence given, the prisoner was whipped, then forced to carry his Cross
to the place of execution, there in the most tender and sinewie parts of the
body nailed to the Cross, then lifted up into the air, there with cruel
mercy for a long while preserved alive; after all this, when cruelty was
satisfied with blood, for the close of all, his joints were broken, and his
soul beat out of his body. This was part of his pain; I say part, I cannot
express the whole, the shame was much more: Infoelix Lignum, says Seneca
truly, and unhappy: for until this time the curse of God was upon him that was
hanged. It is a trespass to bind, it is wickedness to beat, it is murder to
kill: Quid dicam in crucem tollere? Look we to the original, it was first
devised by Tarquinius, as the most infamous punishment of all, against such as
laid violent hands upon themselves. Look we to the use of it, they accounted it
a slaves, nay a dogs death; for in memory that the Dog slept when the Geese
defended the Capitol, every year in great solemnity they carried a Goose in
triumph, softly laid upon a rich carpet, and a Dog hanging upon a cross.
Look we to the concomitancy, Non solent suspensi lugeri, says the Civilian,
no tear was wont to be shed for such as were crucified. And was it expedient
that our Savior should dye this death? It was expedient, that the prophecy of
Esaias might be verified, We saw him made as the basest of men; and of David, A
scorn of men, and the outcast of the people; and of himself, They shall
deliver him to the Gentiles, to mock, scourge, and crucify him. These were
prophesies that it should be so; yet we want a prophecy that says, It is
expedient: That we do not, Oportet filium hominis exaltari, ut Moses extulit
Serpentem; for that Serpent, lifted up to cure all that looked upon it, was an
emblem of Christ. Thus himself, who was a high Priest for ever, did prophecy
of himself, being now both priest and sacrifice. It was expedient that he
should dye, and thus dye: to be forsaken of his friends, falsely accused by his
enemies, to be sold like a slave, mocked like a fool, spit upon like a made
man, whipped like a thief, crucified like a traitor; make up a misery, that the
sun shamed, the earth trembled to behold it: yet it was expedient, it must be
done, God has said it. Me thinks, I hear our Savior say in this baptism
of blood, as he said in his baptism of water, Thus it becomes us to fulfill
all righteousness, and thus it became him, for whom, and by whom are all things,
to consecrate the Prince of our salvation through afflictions. The prophesies
had said it, it should be so, and it was expedient that he to whom they pointed
should fulfill them, that so in fullness of truth he might take his leave of the
cross, and say, Consummatum est, those things which were written of me have
an end.

All this while we see not the reason why he should be thus tormented: Go to
Pilate, his answer will be, I am innocent of the blood of this man: Enquire you
of the Scribes and Pharisees, their answer will be, We have a law, and by this
law he must dye, because he made himself the Son of God. This was no fault, he
was so, and therefore without robbery or blasphemy might both think and declare
himself to be so. Go we further, from popular Pilate and the cruel Jews to
God himself, and though we be but dust and ashes, for the knowledge of this
truth presume we to ask, Cur fecisti filio sic? How may it stand with thy
justice that he should dye, in whom there was found no fault worthy death, nay
no fault at all? the unswer is, Expedit mori pro populo: yet, O Lord, will thou
slay the righteous with the wicked? nay, which is more, will thou slay the
righteous, and spare the wicked? nay, which is yet more, will thou slay the
righteous for the wicked? shall not the Judge of all the world do right? God
cannot choose but do right, the wages of sin is death; though he have not
sinned, the people have. If the principal debtour cannot pay, the surety must;
if the prisoner dare not appear, the bail must: Christ was the surety, the
bail of the people, and so God might permit his justice against sin, to take
hold on him, and he must dye for the people, if he will not have the people
dye.

It being known that he dyed for the people, it is worth the while to know who
these people were, for whom he dyed. Caiphas had respect to the Jews only, and
their temporal good; but the Holy Ghost intended the spiritual good of the
Jews primarily, though not of them alone: but of the people also through the
world. But is it possible, that of all people he should dye for the Jews? Ab
ipsis, and pro ipsis? these were they that spit upon him, whipped him, smote
him on the face, crowned him with thorns, tare him with nails; these were
they, who in the act of his bitter passion, when his soul bereft of all
comfort, laden with the sin of all the world, and fierceness of his Fathers
wrath, enforced from him that speech, than which the world never heard a more
lamentable, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? then in stead of
comfort they reviled him, If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
cross, all this notwithstanding though they persecuted him, he loved them;
though they cried Away with him, he dyed for them, and at his death prayed for
them: Father, forgive, and pleaded for them, they know not what they do; and
wept for them, offering supplications in their behalf with prayers and strong
cries. Greater love than this can no man show, to lay down his life for his
friend: yet thou, O blessed Savior, art a pattern of greater love, laying
down thy life for this people whilst they were thine enemies; but not for
this people only, (the Holy Ghost so speaks) O Lord, we were thine enemies as
well as they, and whilst we were thine enemies, we were reconciled to God the
Father by the precious death of thee his Son. For the Scripture sets forth
his love to us, that whilst we were yet sinners he dyed for us.

He for us, alone for us all: the same spirit which set before him expedit
mori, did sweeten the brim of that sour cup with this promise, that when he
should make his soul an offering for sin, he should see his seed: that as the
whole earth was planted, so it might be redeemed by one blood; as by one
offense condemnation seized upon all, so by the justification of one, the
benefit might redound unto all to the justification of life. And this blood
thirsty Caiphas unwittingly intimated, saying, Expedit unum mori pro populo.

If one, and he then dead could do thus much, what can he not do now, now that
he lives for ever? He trod the wine press alone, neither is there salvation
in any other. S. Stephen was stoned, S. Paul beheaded, Nunquid pro nobis? No,
it cost more than so, it is done to their hands, there is one, who by the
oblation of himself alone once offered, has made a perfect and sufficient
sacrifice for the sins of the whole world.

And that whilst it is a world: for our Savior, that stood in the gap betwixt
Gods wrath and us, catching the blow in his own body, has by his blood
purchased an eternal redemption; every one that believes in him shall not
perish, but have life everlasting. In the number of which believers if we be,
then is the fruit of his meritorious passion extended to us, we may challenge
our interest therein; and in our persons the Prophet speaks, He bare our
infirmities and carried our sorrows, he was wounded for our transgressions,
the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes are we healed.

Which great benefit, as it is our bounden duty to remember at all times, so
this time, this day Vivaciorem animi sensum, and puriorem mentis exigit
intuitum, recursus temporis, and textus lectionis, as S. Leo speaks, The
annual recourse of the day, and this text fitted to it, calls to our mind
the work wrought, and the means by which it was wrought on this day: to him a
day of wrath, of darkness, of blackness, and heavy vengeance; but to us a
good day, a good Friday, a day of deliverance and freedom, a day of jubilee
and triumph. For as on this day by the power of his Cross were we delivered
from the sting of sin, and tyranny of Satan, so that whereas we might for ever
have sung that mournful Elegy, O wretched men that we are, who shall deliver us
from death and hell? we are now enabled to insult over both, O death, where is
thy sting? O hell, where is thy victory? Which victory of our Savior, and ours
through him so dearly purchased, when we call to mind, let us consider withal,
that as the cause of this conflict on his part was his love to us; so on our
parts it was the hainousness of our sin, not otherwise to be expiated than by
his death. And as the first ought to raise us up to give annual, daily, and
continual thanks to him, who did and suffered so much for us; so the second
should withhold us, and keep us back from sin: that since our Savior dyed for
our sin, we should dye to sin, and rather dye than sin. This blood once shed is
good to us; Expedit nobis, if to faith in that blood we join a life beseeming
Christianity: but if by our crying sins and trespasses we crucify him again,
we make even that blood, which of it self speaks for us better things than
the blood of Abel, in stead of pardon to cry for vengeance against us.

Let us therefore look up to him the author and finisher of our salvation,
beseeching him, who with the blood of his passion clave rocks and stones
asunder, with the same blood, which is not yet nor ever will be dry, to
mollify and soften our hard hearts, that seriously considering the
heinousness of our sins, which put him to death, and his unexpressible and
unconceivable love, that for us he would dye the death, even the death of the
Cross; we may in token of our thankfulness endeavor to offer up our souls
and bodies as a reasonable sacrifice to him that offered himself a sacrifice
for us, and now sits at the right hand of God; to this end, that where he
our Redeemer is, there we his people and dearest purchase may be for ever.

THE SECOND ROW.
And in the second row thou shall set a Carbuncle, a Saphir, and a Diamond.
THat the second Speaker, that sweet singer of Israel, whose ditty was, Awake,
and sing ye that sleep in dust, made (according to my Text) a row, or Canticum
graduum, a Psalm of ascents or degrees, I cannot but even in a duty of
thankfulness acknowledge, for the help of memory I received from it: had not
he made a row, that is, digested and disposed his matter in excellent order, I
should never have bin able to present to you the jewels set in this row, which
are all (as you see) most orient. Of all red stones the Carbuncle, of all blew
the Saphir, Plin. not. hist. l. 37.
of all simply the Diamond has been ever held in highest esteem: Maximum in
rebus humanis pretium adamas habet, non tantum inter gemmas. Comment. in Esaias.
Carbunculus (says S. Jerome) videtur mihi sermo doctrinae, qui fugato errore
tenebrarum illuminat corda credentium, hic est quem unus de Seraphim tulit
farcipe comprehensum ad Esayae labra purganda. Whether this second Preacher (in
S. Paul's phrase a Prophet) his tongue were not touched with such a coal, I
refer my self to your hearts and consciences, Nonne ardebat cor vestrum in
vobis, cum exponeret vobis Scripturas? The second jewel was a Saphir, according
to the Hebrew derivation from Sepher, a book, wherein we may read both the
doctrine and graces of the second Speaker: Hic lapis (ut perhibent) educit
corpore vinctos, says Vincentius; and was not his doctrine a Jayle-delivery of
all deaths prisoners? It is a constant tradition among the Rabbis, that the
tables of stone, Bellar. l. 2. de Verb. Dei.
wherein the ten Commandments were written with the finger of God, were of
Saphir. For although Pliny affirms, Not. hist. l. 37.
that the Saphir is a stone altogether unfit for sculpture, yet this can be no
just exception against this tradition, since the engraving of the ten
Commandments was done by the finger of God above nature. Moreover, it is
clear out of this Text, that the name of one of the Patriarchs was written in
the Saphir. Such a Saphir was the second Speaker, having the Laws of God
imprinted in his heart. The third jewel is a Diamond, in Hebrew called
Jahalom, because it breaks all other stones; in Greek Adamas, that is,
unconquerable, because it can neither be broken by the hammer, nor consumed in
the fire: nay, the fire (says Zenocrates) has not so much power as to stain
the color, much less impeach the substance of this stone. Call to mind among
the virtues of a Magistrate, conspicuous in this divine Orator, his
unconquerable courage and unstained integrity, and the comparison is already
made. Pliny reports, Adamantem sideritem alio Adamante perforari: think you
not, that if a man could have a heart as hard as the Adamant, this Adamant,
pointed with sacred eloquence, could break it and make it contrite? Lastly,
Pliny adds, that the Diamond is a sovereign remedy against poison, Et ideo
regibus charissimus, iisque paucis cognitus, in high esteem with Princes: if,
as our gracious Sovereign has, so all Christian Princes had such Diamonds as
this; if such Preachers were their eare-rings, they should be free from the
danger of all poisoned and heretical doctrine.

If as the stones placed in the second row agree with the gifts of the Speaker,
so they sort as well with the doctrines of his Text, I am sure you will all say,
that this second order of stones is not out of order. A most remarkable story
of the Carbuncle we have, that cast in the fire among live coals, it seems to
have no grace in it; but quench the other coals with water, and it shines more
gloriously in the ashes than ever before: so our Savior in the brunt of his
passion, while he was heat by the firebrarnds of hell, Scribes and Pharisees,
Jews and Romans, seemed to be dead, and lose all his color and beauty, nay,
was indeed dead according to his humane nature (his soul being severed from
his body:) but after the consummation of his passion, and the extinction of the
fiery rage of his persecuters with his blood, in his resurrection he showed
himself a most glorious Carbuncle, shining in majesty, and burning in love.
After his resurrection, in the day of his ascension, he takes possession of
his throne in heaven, which, Chap. 1. V. 26.
in Ezekiel is said to be like a Saphir stone, and now sitting at the right
hand of God the Father, having conquered sin, death, and hell, and made all his
enemies his footstool, he is become the only true orient Diamond in the world:
whether you take the name from the Greek damas, ab and damao, or the Hebrew
from, being invincible himself, and overcomming all adverse power, breaking
his obstinate enemies in pieces, like a potters vessel, with a rod of iron.

The embossment of gold, in which these gems of divine doctrine were set, was
his Text taken out of

A Sermon preached by Doctor John King then Dean of Christ-Church, and
Vicechancellor of the University of Oxford, afterward Lord Bishop of London,
upon Easter day in Saint Peter's Church in Oxford.


ESAIAS 26.19. Thy dead men shall live together, with my body shall they rise:
awake and sing ye that dwell in dust; for the dew is as the dew of herbs, and
the earth shall cast up her dead.


IT would ask the labor of an hour to settle this one only member, I find
such a Babel of tongues at odds about so few words. Variae lectiones.


Whereas we read terra projiciet, or ejiciet, the earth shall cast up or bring
forth, as it does her herbs and winter prisoners, Junius has, Dejecisti in
terram, Castalio, terram demoliris, the Seventy, Terra cadet, S. Jerome,
Dejicies in terram, the Chaldee paraphrase, Trades in infernum: and for
mortuos, in Hebrew (...)
Rephaim, from a word signifying to cure, per antiphrasin the Seventy read
(...), the wicked or ungodly; S. Jerome, Gigantes, stout and robustious against
God. But to set you in a right and inoffensive way, I reduce almost an infinity
of distractions to two heads. For all of them either speak of the resurrection
of the dead indefinitely, which they do that say, Terra ejiciet, to wit,
postquam in terram dejecisti. For the earth cannot cast up that it has not:
and, Manium terram demoliris; or of the destruction of the wicked, one only
species of the dead, which the Seventy call impios, others Giants, mighty to
transgress; both senses, as the Northern and Southern rivers running from
contrary points meet in the Ocean; so these from sundry and discrepant conceits
run into one common place of the general resurrection, save that the latter
add a strain to the former of Gods vengeance, and wrath prepared for the
wicked.

Sense twofold.
Thus having set the letters of my Text together, and accorded the words, it
remains that their scope and intent be freed from question. There is not one
of the learned Scribes, old or new, Jew or Christian, whose spirit and pen has
not fallen upon one of these two senses (viz.) that the Prophet either speaks
of the resurrection of the dead at the last day, or of the restitution and
enlargement of the people from their present straights: in which (say they)
calamity is a kind of death, captivity as the grave, Gods people as the seed in
the ground, Gods grace and favor as the comfortable dew, to revive and restore
them to their wonted being. Of these two companies some go after the literal
grammatical sense, lending not so much as the cast of their eye toward the
allegory, as Strigelius, Clarius, Brentius: Others on the other side of the
bank standing for the shadowed resurrection, are not so peremptory; but si
quis aliter sentire mavult, per me liber hoc faciat: and Calvin himself in his
commentary lays out as it were a lot, as well for the true as the typical
resurrection: Falluntur Christiani, qui ad extremum judicium restringunt,
Prophetatotum Christi regnum ab initio ad finem usque complectitur. Aquinas
equally joyneth them both; Hic est propositio resurrectionis, vel corporalis in
die novissimo, vel a miseria captivitatis. To conclude then, as in the 37.
chapter of Ezekiel the resurrection of the dead is brought in as an argument by
God himself, to ascertaine the people of their delivery from thraldom; an
argument a majore ad minus: Can he raise and revive the dead? and can he not
much more restore the distressed? yet I will be bold to say, that the proper
resurrection of the dead, without the veil of a metaphor in the hardest
construction that can be made of the words, is either the scope of the Prophet,
or his proof, his intent or his argument, his maine and principal conclusion,
or his strongest principle to demonstrate his conclusion. And Mr. Gualter
gives a good reason why all other comforts are sealed up with this doctrine
and promise of the universal resurrection, Quod nulla alia sit certa and
solida consolatio, because all other calmes are temporary, flux and mutable,
from which there are recidivations and relapses into subsequent storms. By
this time I am secure, that no mist of an allegory can so trouble or dim your
eyes, but that you clearly behold in the true glass of my Text a fair and
undoubted image of the resurrection of the dead; which being the proper subject
of this feast, I hope I have sufficiently warranted the choice of my theme,
and so I proceed to the explication.

Thy dead shall live, with my body shall they rise, awake and sing, Analysis
Textus, partium ordo and divisio.
etc. Ye see how many members there are in the body of my Text; yet in
resolution and in issue they are all but one: It is a totum similare. As the
whole water of the sea is but water, and yet every drop of the sea is water
too; so the whole bulk and shocke of my Text is the resurrection, and yet
every part and parcel thereof is the resurrection also: for mark the words,
Vivent, resurgent, evigilabunt, cantabunt, germinabunt, projicientur. mortui,
cadaver, pulvis, habitatores pulveris, herbae, inferi seu manes. What is this
in the whole composition, what in every limb and joint apari, but the ecchoing
and resounding from one to the other the doctrine of the resurrection?

To omit (besides all these which have their tabernacle in the sun, and are
evident and apert professions thereof) many secret and mineral arguments
couched in the bowels and bosom of my Text, which shall be extracted in their
due time. Bees are not so like Bees, but that there are individual differences
between them; neither are the members of my Text so like, but that they may be
distinguished. Thus then by way of objection and answer you may perceive their
distinction and order, as also the maine scope to which they tend.

Does any object, Nihil est post mortem, death is an utter extinction? It is
answered, not so: for thy dead shall live. Does he go on and say, they may
live in their spirits, which never dye; but what for their bodies? It is
answered, With my body shall they rise. Rise, do you say? but by what
authority? what shall be the instrument and means thereof? The shrill sound of
the last Trump awaking them out of their sleep, and the voice of God, Awake ye
that dwell in dust. Awake they may and rise, but to no less wretchedness and
misery than before: Answer, They shall awake and sing; it shall be a triumphant
and joyful resurrection. Yea, but show us any sign thereof, and we will
believe it: Answer, Thy dew is the dew of herbs; nature has printed this truth
in every garden thou walk in. Lastly, if they say the earth has devoured
our bodies, how shall we then arise? It is answered, Terra projiciet, the earth
shall be driven to disgorge and cast them up again.

There are degrees and ascents in my Text: 1. Vivent may be in soul; but 2.
Resurgent must be in body. 3. Evigilabunt may be to sorrow; but 4. Cantabunt
must be to joy. 5. Ros herbarum is but a light from nature; but 6. Terra
projiciet is an act of irrisistible compulsory power. The first is the
fundamental proposition, and shows the entity, what is and shall be, Vivent
mortui. The second is exposition, and shows the manner, Resurgent. The third
is confirmation, and shows the efficiency, Evigilabunt. The fourth is
congratulation, and shows the quality, Cantabunt. The fifth is illustration,
and shows the probability, Ros herbarum. The sixth and last is conclusion,
and shows the necessity, Terra projiciet. There is a time of gathering, and a
time of scattering. These six, either members or remarkable points and joints
of my Text, hitherto severed, since the Prophet has construed together, I will
reduce to three combinations, and so handle them. The 1. Vivent and resurgent.
2. Evigilate and cantate. 3. Ros tuus and terra projiciet.


The first combination or conjugation is Vivent and Resurgent. There is a
difference between them; the former is partial and incomplete, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob were alive (as is proved by our Saviors argument: Deus non est Deus
mortuorum, sed viventium) when their bodies were not living; the latter is
total and absolute, and adds the life of the body to the life of the soul.
(...) is of that whereof before there was (...) they shall live therefore and
rise, but who? Mortui, the dead; the dead is the common genus and sagena, that
comprehends all sorts good and bad: Moritur pariter doctus and indoctus, in hoc
tertio we all agree. In the first and archetypall world, when one man was as
nine men, had nine men's ages, yet the end and period of all their acts is, Et
mortuus est: and whatsoever the chronicles of the Kings of Judah and Israel
omit besides, they omit not this, Et dormivit cum patribus. Death is that
Syncope or Elision, that cutteth not out letters or leaves, but lives; and
which not Grammar, but nature shall cause us to understand: -- Mors ultima
linea rerum, our whole life being but linea circumducta rediens ad idem
punctum, a pulvere ad pulverem, the assured period and full point after all
other points, pawses, sections and intersections, changes and vicissitudes of
this mortal life: after all our eatings and drinkings the symbolum or shot
that must be paid, the center, to which our corruptible body, which presses
down the soul, does by its weight and pronenesse forcibly tend.

Mortui. Consider once for all the subject of this clause, and all the
proposition, and how it climbeth; first mortui: secondly, cadaver: thirdly,
pulvis: fourthly, habitatores pulveris: fifthly, inferi and manes; free
Denizons among the dead, such as might say to corruption, thou art our father;
and to worms and dust, ye are our brothers and sisters. Yet these dead
carcasses, carrion, dust, inveterate dust, netherlanders, shall live and rise:
Non obstat potentiae Dei diuturna putredo, walk but a pace or two backward,
ye shall find a negative to this affirmative, the dead shall not live. Is
there yea and nay in the Holy Ghost? Yea, and both true. For elucidation
whereof take the rule of Brentius in his Nominibus, meum and tuum ^ita est tota
vis concionis: Thy dead shall rise, that is, the Lords dead, either mortui
propter Dominum, as Martyrs; or in Domino, as all believers; or quorum tota
vita martyrium, whether they live or dye they are the Lords: Interfecti mei in
some readings, in the genuine cadaver meum, the dead being, or which are my
body, and then by collection, as Junius well observes, cadavera mea quoque,
all the bodies of my Saints, which are as it were mine, because they belong to
my mystical body. Now then when it was said Mortui non resurgent, Mortui was
put simply, and without addition, as Hyperius says: but in these propositions
mortui vivent, cadaver resurget, you have a specificall difference, not omnes
mortui, but tui, that is, Gods: cadaver, non omne, sed meum, that is, Christ's:
opposite whereunto are mortui Satanae, and cadaver Antichristi. Hence comes
that seeming antilogie, or contradictio linguarum, strife of tongues,
Resurgent, non resurgent, they shall, they shall not rise. But shall not all
live, and rise again? Doubtless they shall, the righteous in a right and
real acception: their life is a life indeed, vital, immortal, Angelical,
nourished at the tree and fountain of life, animated and perpetuated from the
Lord of life, and they rise as the morning Sun fairer and fairer, to a
glorious, joyful, incorruptible, and celestial resurrection. Non sic impii,
non sic, they live, or rather dye a death, and that the second, and that second
a thousand fold; or rather they live a life, a term without term, of being
and not being, corrupting and not ceasing, burning and not consuming: Ignis
eorum non interit, they shall never be able to extinguish their fire, nor their
fire them; absumit ut servet, servat ut cruciet, the Salamanders of hell fire
are kept in torment and vexation for evermore: and they rise, ut lapsu graviore
ruant; as Jezebel was mounted to the window to be cast down to the dogs: as
Herod to his throne, for a more woeful and spectable ruin: as Lucifer, or
rather Tenebrifer (as Bernard calls him) to the side of the mountain, for a
more astonishable confusion. Our Savior knits up both in two words: Some shall
rise to the resurrection of life, there is the true vivent and resurgent; some
to the resurrection of condemnation, there is the opposite.

The second combination is Evigilate and cantate: ye shall observe in this and
diverse other passages in this Prophet diverse interlocutions, prosopopeia's, and
changing of persons. First, here the Prophet speaks to God, or God to Christ,
Thy dead shall live: Secondly, Christ to his Father, With my body shall they
rise: Thirdly, here is Gods apostrophe to the dead, Awake and sing: Fourthly,
the answer of the dead to God, Ros tuus, that is, quem tu irrorasti; or Gods
apostrophe to his Church, Ros tuus, id est, qui super te cadet, O Ecclesia mea:
Last of all, as it were the chorus and consent of all, Terra projiciet.

Awake and sing are Gods alarm to the dead; habitatores pulveris, the household
and meniall to dust. Now what voice, but the voice of God shall I say, like a
Trumpet, or the roaring of a Lion, or the sound of many waters, or a clap or
crack of thunder (all come too short) were able to inform and actuate dust and
rubble to audience? Loquor ad Dominum might they say with Abraham, cum sim
pulvis and cinis? Howsoever pulvis and cinis in synthesi may do it, I am sure
pulvis and cinis in analysi cannot. We attempt not to rowze up those that are
in a dead sleep without loud cries, but is any man so mad as to spend his
voice, though a stentorian, and rend his throat against deaf rocks? Behold,
God does more than this by that powerful instrument of his glorious Word, that
gladius delphicus, that is more than Moses rod, wherewith he wrought wonders:
more than Jacobs staff, wherewith he prospered: more than Judah's scepter,
wherewith he governed: more than Joseph's cup, wherewith he divined: I say,
by that powerful instrument, by which he said Fiant to heaven and earth, and
they were created; Effata to deaf ears, and they were opened: Tace to the
raging of the sea, and it was stilled: Obmutesce to the crying Devil, and he
was silenced: Exi for as to the dead carcasses, and they came forth; by that
does he say to these dead and moultred in the earth, Awake and sing.

Awake: but with what eyes to behold the light of heaven? when the windows of
their bodies have bin long since shut down, their crystal glasses of nature
broken, their seers sunk into the holes of their head, clay dwells in their
tabernacles, and rottenness in their circles, and the scorn of the Idol in
Baruch is fallen upon them, They cannot wipe the dust from their eyes.

And sing. How shall they sing in a strange land? what be their instruments to
sing to? where is their living harp, and well tuned cymball? is it hung upon
the willowes of Babylon, or rather tied to the roof of their mouth? where are
their songs of praise and thanksgiving, which they sang in the land of the
living? -- Olim ego longas
Cantando memini solitum consumere noctes;
Nunc oblita mihi tot carmina.
We are now laid in the land of forgetfulness, we have taken up and made our
beds in the dark, our mouth is filled with gravel, and the slime of the pit
sticks in our throats: all this notwithstanding, they that are in their
tombs and graves shall hear the voice of the Son of man, and earth, earth,
earth in Jeremy winnowed and boulted by death into the smallest dust, shall be
effigiated and shaped anew into living men; Et ex his vermiculis and pulvere,
says Saint Bernard, instaurabuntur muri coelistis Jerusalem.

Before I end this second combination, I remember that I noted unto you two
things: first, the efficiency in the exuscitation, Awake; where forget not in
the mean while to reserve for a latter meditation, that death by the phrase of
my Text is a sleep: secondly, the quality; for since they are willed to sing,
that imports a joyful resurrection: Musica in luctu importuna, and it must be
a most joyful resurrection, when such as shall partake thereof not only (...)
(so the Seventy) but (...) (Aquilas) and (...) (Symmachus) and (...)
(Theodotian.) Agreeable hereunto is that of our Savior, Lift up your heads,
for your redemption draws nigh. And here once more to the wicked we send
libellum repudii: Non est vobis pars, neque sors, ye may not consort with us
in our blessed harmony, the voices of Ashdod and Canaan cannot tune together:
to you belongs, plangent tribus terrae, and tribulabitur ibi fortis, your
singing shall be turned to sighing, your Tabrets and Shaumes into everlasting
beatings and hammerings on the anviles of your breast, your showting into
howling and yelling, your clapping of hands into gnashing of teeth, your
praising into blaspheming and cursing, and all your rejoicing shall be as the
mourning of Hadradrimmon in the valley of Megiddo; yea much more than of
Hadradrimmon, because in the valley of Hinnon, is the lake and furnace of
endless disconsolation. This Prophet shall conclude, Behold my servants shall
rejoice, and ye shall be ashamed: my servants shall sing for joy of heart, and
ye shall cry for sorrow, and howl for vexation of mind.

The third combination is, Ros tuus and terra projiciet, which gives a double
proof of the former doctrine: the one as it were of course, nature and common
sense teaches; the other of force, the creature must and shall accomplish it.
Terra projiciet, that is, says Rabbie David, Thou (O God) shall command it.
The learned in their Commentaries distinguish these proofs by a discrepancy of
words, Elicere proper to the dew, and projicere fatal to the earth: the dew
gently allureth, and calls forth the herbs; so does the Word and Spirit of
God sweetly and easily bring up (may I say) these embryo's of death. But say
that the earth withhold them, opposing her locks and bars, and pleading
perhaps the prescription of hundreds or thousands of years, there is then
place for projiciet, (...), angry and impatient though she be, reddet, non sua,
she must cast them up, as the stomach a surfeit, and a woman an abortive fruit.
See how God has furnished us with all sorts of arguments: if Liber foederis
will not serve, we may read in the book of nature, or rather Bibliotheca
librorum, described with a text hand, in fair and capital letters, the
resurrection of the dead. Interroga jumenta, says Job: Interroga olera, says
my Prophet: Considera Lilia agri, says our Savior: look into the fields, or
sit still in your gardens, every one under his own vine, and behold the growth
of the plants and flowers, how after the cold of Winter, when the deadness of
the year had blotted and blurred as it were the face of the earth, and the
print of nature seems to be quite razed out; yet (as Esaias speaks of the
Oak and Elm) there is a substance in them, and by the comfort of the vernall
sunshine, and fatness of the clouds dropping on them, they garnish and cover
the earth again, as with the carpets of Egypt, and clothe it as with a Joseph's
coat, with all the variety of colors nature can invent. Nature is full of
such demonstrations; I could bring you a band of creatures to strengthen this
point. The bird of Arabia that rises out of her own ashes, the insecta
animalia that spend the Winter season in a shadow of death, the seed that lies
and dies in the earth, our sleepings and awakings, nights and days, winters
and summers, autumnes and springs; but I leave them all, and cleave to the
resemblance in my Text, Thy dew is as the dew of herbs; but when this dew and
soft distillation is too weak to work this effect, God has a torrent and
flood to do it: Terra ejiciet, and contermina terrae, the sea that is married
to the earth and lies in her arms and bosom. He shall say to the sea, Give;
and to the earth, Restore, and all creatures in them, and in all the world
besides that have devoured and swallowed the flesh of his chosen, when that day
comes, shall find that they have eaten morsels like aspes, and drank a
draught of deadly poison, too strong and hard of digestion for their over weak
stomachs. I end with the words of this Prophet, chapt. 66. Quis audivit unquam
tale? quis vidit huic simile? nunquid parturiet terra in die una? and tota gens
parietur simul? at this day it shall be so.

Saphirus aureis punctis collucet, the best kind of Saphir, The recapitulation
with addition of appendant arguments.
says the Naturalist, has something like points of gold in it: Such were
these we now handled; give me leave to use the Speakers phrase, though not in
his sense, spare me to recapitulate, or rather from recapitulation: for what
have I done else all this while?

Me thinks the six parts of this Text are like the six cities of refuge,
Deuteronomy. 19.
to which those that had slain, shall I say? nay, rather those that are slain
may fly, to save shall I say? nay, but to recover and restore their lives: and
they are all like the wheels in Ezekiels vision, Rota in rota: or as the
celestial Spheres one in the other, all moving alike to the same purpose: all
striving for an Article of faith, one of the twelve flowers in the garland of
our Creed, one of the twelve stones in the foundation of the holy City. I
remember in the inheritance of Judah, among the rest there fell to their share
sex civitates, and villae earum. Is there any such a desert so barren, so
hopeless, so waste, as death and the grave, desertion of life and being, when
milk forsakes the breasts, marrow the bones, blood the veins, spirit the
arteries, and the soul the body? yet when you are brought to this desert of
deserts, you shall find sex civitates, and villas earum, six maine and eminent
proofs of the resurrection, with as many less, like suburbs, granges, and
appertinent villages. For first, Mortui vivent is a maine argument, grounded
upon the Word and Promise, like civitas; but mortui tui is civitas and villa, a
maine with an appendant argument drawn from the propriety that God has in us.
Secondly, Cadaver resurget is civitas, but cadaver meum is civitas and villa, a
maine argument, with an appendant drawn from the society between the head and
the members: he that raised Christ shall quicken us. Thirdly, Awake and sing
are civitates, main arguments drawn from the command and power of God, who
says, Return ye sons of Adam, and they return; but that the nature of the
phrase should import a sleep, and no death, no privation of speech, but (...)
pythagoricam, for a while, till God loosen the strings of the tongue, and put
breath into the organ again, these are civitates and villae earum. Yet
further, by Montanus his collection, pulvis and habitatores pulveris are
villae, appendant arguments, the one from the matter of our creation, when we
are at the worst we are but dust, from which our creation was, and why may not
from thence our recreation be? the other from the term of our abode,
habitatio; which (says he) is not of those that take up their mansion or long
home, but of sojourners and factours, who continue for a while in foreign
countries till they have dispatched their affairs. Add lastly to all these
the map of the whole earth, in every leaf of grass describing the truth of
this doctrine: -- inscripti nomine vitae
nascuntur flores --
with those insufferable passions, pangs, and angariations, which the common
mother to us all is put unto, till she be rid of us, as the Whale of Jonas.

A word of application, and it shall be the explication, which some very
learned Expositors give upon cadaver meum. We have hitherto taken it to be the
word of Christ to his Father; they say rather it is the word of the Prophet to
his brethren, as if in effect he had said, I preach to you no other doctrine
than that I believe my self: I teach that the dead shall live, and I am
assured that with my body shall they rise. In which sense it is a parallel to
that Magna Charta, that great and memorable record which Job transmitteth to
all posterity, I know my Redeemer lives, and I my self shall see him with
these eyes, and no other; concionantur profani homines, the fashion of these
worldly men is to prate of the life of the righteous, as Balaam of their death,
like men in a trance, without sense or affection after it. The food of the
soul is unto them as Barzillai his bodily food was unto him, they eat it
without any appetite or relish: (Has thy servant any taste in that he eats,
says he to David?) and the comforts of the Gospel to them as music to him:
(Can I hear the voice of singing men or women?) They behold Canaan from the
Mount, and the goodness of God afar off: my meaning is, they can talk of
cadavera aliorum, but mind not, or at least hope not for cadaver meum: Odi
sapientem qui sibi non sapit; qui sibi nequam, cui bonus? Nequam, says Saint
Bernard, is as much as nequaquam: all that this man knows or does is as much
as nothing, since it avails not himself; his case is like that of Tantalus,
(...), as Plato says, who has apples at his lips, and water at his chinne,
and yet pines for want. O unhappy man, go to the prodigal child, he came to
his father with (...), and to that child of the world, who came to our
Savior, Magister, dic fratri ut dividat mecum haereditatem, that is, suffer
not a goodly inheritance of a joyful resurrection to be taken away by the
violent, but thrust thou in for thy part among them, and when they shall say,
corpora nostra, our bodies shall rise, say thou with a fiduciall faith, cadaver
meum, so shall my body rise: and let every one that hears me this day say
with the Prophet, Remember me, O Lord, with the favor of thy people, and
visit me with thy salvation, that I may see the felicity of thy chosen, and
rejoice in the joy of thy people, and glory with thine inheritance.

THE THIRD ROW.
And in the third row a Turkeys, an Agate, and an Amethyst.
FEw there are but know the Turkeys, tanquam ungues digitosque suos, wearing it
usually in the pale of their rings. An excellent property it is said to have of
changing color with the sick party that wears it, and thereby expressing a
kind of sympathy. Rueus a great Lapidary averres upon his own knowledge as
much: I was acquainted (says he) with a man whose Turkeys suddenly upon his
death changed color, Rueus de gem. Ego novi quendam quo mortuo Turcois
apparuit obscurior.
and fell in the price. The Agate is a gemme of diverse colors, spots and
lines, the concurse whereof is sometimes so happy, that it represents the
lineaments of men, beasts, and other natural bodies: Nunc formas rerum dans,
nunc simulachra deorum. Of all, that of Pyrrhus was held by him in greatest
estimation, of others in admiration, wherein the lines and spots were so drawn
by nature, Plin. l. 37. c. 1. In Pyrrhi Achate novem Musae and Apollo citharam
tenens spectabantur, non art, sed sponte naturae ita discurrentibus maculis,
ut Mulis quoque singulis sua redderentur insignia.
that Apollo with the nine Muses and their several instruments were
conspicuous in it. As for the Amethyst, it is a gemme of a middle color,
between wine and violets, so named either because applied to the navell it is a
remedy against drunkenness, ab (...) steretico and (...), or (as says Pliny)
quod ad vini colorem accedens priusquam degustet in violam desinat. Of this
third rank of stones this may suffice for the application to the third
Speaker, and his doctrine: himself, touching the infirmities of the Clergy and
Laity, so feelingly resembled the Turkeys, which the Jewelists make the emblem
of compassion. His Sermon, for the variety of good learning in it, was a
curious Agat, and most like that of Pyrrhus above mentioned, wherein the nine
Muses were pourtrayed: the parts thereof were like the Amethyst,
parti-colored, partly like wine, partly like violets: like wine in his matter
of confutation, strong and searching; like violets in his exhortation, sweet
and comfortable. His description of Christ's bloody death was like wine, the
blood of the grape; but of the resurrection like violets, the first fruits of
the Spring.

A Sermon preached on Easter Monday by Master Dunster, fellow of Magdalen
College, and Proctor of the University of Oxford.
APOC. 1.18. I am he that lives and was dead, and behold I am alive for
evermore, Amen, and have the keys of hell and of death.


THese words are a parcel of that book, the reading whereof the ancient
Church esteemed so profitable and needful, that they enjoined all upon pain
of excommunication to read it once a year, between Easter and Whitsontide:
Qui eam a Paschate ad Pentecosten non legerit, excommunicationis sententiam
habeat. The words of my Text in special are verba pronuntiata verbi
annuntiati, the words spoken of the word fore-spoken, the Son of God, who is
so careful not to break the bruised reed, that he seeks to expectorate all
fear out of the minds of all true believers by the force of many arguments.

The first is drawn a potentia Dei, I am the Creator and Judge of your
persecuters; therefore fear them not.

The second a praerogativa Christi, I am the first and the last, and will take
notice of every one that has been unjustly put to death, and make inquisition
of blood, from the blood of the righteous Abel, to the blood of the last Martyr
that shall be shed upon the earth, and will require it of them that have spilt
it. I am the first: for, in principio erat Verbum; and I am the last,
novissimus Adam, manifested in novissimis diebus, to come in novissima tuba,
and take account of novissimus quadrans; I am he that lives, etc.

Here omitting the vain glosses and collections of some, who turn an history
into a mystery, and apply ridiculously S. John's falling before Christ's feet,
mentioned Ver. 17. to the kissing of the Popes Pantofle; and the description
Primus and novissimus, the first and the last, to a Prelate or Pastor, who
ought to be primus ad laborem, novissimus ad requiem, first at his labor, and
last at his ease; I take these words with Saint Austine to be Symbolum
abbreviatum, wherein we are to observe, 1. The death: 2. The resurrection of
Christ, 1. Prefaced with a note of attention, Behold. 2. Sealed with a note of
certainty, Amen.
3. The fruits and issue of both, 1. In us, 1. Freedom from death. 2.
Assurance of life.
2. In him, the power of the keys, 1. Authoritative. 2. Possessive, I have.




I am alive, and I was dead. Et quando vixisti, bone Jesu? when did thou
live, sweet Jesu? from the time thou leftest thy Fathers bosom, and satest on
thy mothers knee, jam extunc dura pati coepisti, says Saint Bernard. Many a
time have they fought against me from my youth up may Israel, nay, the God of
Israel say. And this some will have to be signified in the phrase, (...), I was
made dead, not struck down at one blow; that might have been a favor: Quid
dabis ut uno ictu mortem afferam filio? but he was put to a tedious and
lingering death: Gregory says, Tota vita Christi crux fuit. The Son of God
humbled himself; that is not enough, (...), he emptied himself, made
himself of no reputation, and became Homo, and in homine infra hominem: nam
flagellari ingenui non est, to be scourged is no ingenuous punishment. But it
may be the shame was lessened, because of his Crown: What Crown, I pray you?
thorns platted upon his temples? O Regem, O Diadema, O King, O Crown, says
Bernard: See, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, behold King Solomon with the Crown
wherewith his mother the Synagogue crowned him. But the worst is behind, he
is condemned to dye: Why, what has he done? Is he a disturber of the peace,
who being scarce borne gave peace to all the world, who himself is the Prince
of peace, and his word the Gospel of peace, and his messengers the Angels of
peace, and his mandate the same with that of Theodosius to Demophilus: Si tu
pacem fugis, ego te ab Ecclesia mea fugere mando, If thou flyest peace, I
command thee to get thee packing out of my Kingdom? Did he blaspheme, because
he said, I am the Son of God? Si opera Dei facit, quid prohibet Filium Dei
appellari? Was he against the tradition of the Elders? only against such as
annihilated the Law of God, against such upon whom the name of blasphemy is
written: such as are those of the Church of Rome. Traditio multis partibus
superat Scripturas, says Costerus: and Salva Ecclesiae traditione, non multum
refert etiamsi Scripturae aboleantur. Was he a malefactor, of whom all the
people witnessed, Recte omnia fecit? All this notwithstanding he is condemned
to dye, and to that death which the Holy Ghost speaks not of without a
gradation; Mortem autem crucis: nor the Heathen Orator without a Quid dicam in
crucem tollere? Yet all this is but Joseph his coat torn with the teeth of
wild beasts: Vasculum Anaxarchi, non Anaxarchus. We hear of the outward man
in agone, not the inward man in agonia. I dare not set the pains of the
damned, Gods wrath, and Christ's body in a balance; Crux Christi statera est,
says Saint Bernard. I like in such points rather a Divine of the temper of the
Lacedaemonians, In ea quibus fidit vix ingredientem, than an Athenian, Supra
vires audacem, liable to Archidamus his check, (...), Aut add viribus, aut
adime animo.

Hominem colitis, hominem Palaestinum and crucifixum adoratis pro Deo: and,
Deus vester patibulo affixus est, say the Heathen, Ye worship a God who was
put to death and crucified. We do so, (...), nay, (...), it was necessary and
expedient that he should so dye: If the wheat corn dye not in the earth, it
abides alone; but if it dye, it brings forth much fruit: Gratias ago tritico
quod sic mori voluit and multiplicari. We say with Tertullian, Quod Deo
indignum est, nobis expedit: with Saint Jerome, Injuria Domini nostra gloria:
and conclude with Saint Ambrose, Quanto major injuria, tanto major ei debetur
gratia.

old man crucified in him, and we are dead to sin: how then shall we live
therein? I have put off my clothes, says the Spouse, how should I put them on?
I have washed my feet, how should I defile them? To lay down our sins, or
put them off is not sufficient, (...), they must be mortified: and this is
that death which Saint Leo says is precious in the sight of God, cum occiditur
homo non terminatione sensuum, sed fine vitiorum.

Behold, I am alive for evermore. Of the diverse significations of Ecce two
serve for our purpose; Ecce insultationis, and Ecce consolationis: Ecce
insultationis, as behold he comes with the clouds, etc. Ecce consolationis,
as behold the stone that the builders refused is become the head of the corner.
So here for the terror of Infidels and Persecuters of Christ's Church, and for
the comfort of the faithful an Ecce is prefixed: Behold, he that was dead is
alive. Behold the sweet flower of Jesse withered and defaced in his Passion,
but re-flourishing again in his resurrection, and in him is the blooming and
springing of all that love his Name.

I am alive. Other doctrine, says Tertullian, Christ preached per semetipsum;
but this of the resurrection in semetipso. Alive for ever. The Scripture
speaks of some that rose mortui, sed morituri. Christ so rose, ut nunquam
cadere adjiciat, being risen from the dead he dies no more, death has no
more power over him. Amen is a note of certainty, like Selah in the Psalms,
which (as a seal) is put by the finger of the Holy Ghost to the words of that
God, who is Deus Amen, and whose promises are Yea and Amen.

Amen and the former Ecce we are taught, That the Holy Ghost labors to
secure us and confirm us in the certainty of the doctrine of the resurrection,
knowing it to be the faith and patience of the Saints: Fiducia Christianorum
resurrectio mortuorum, says Tertullian. If our hope were in this life only,
we were of all men most miserable, says Saint Paul. And the rather does the
Spirit ascertaine this doctrine, because it has many enemies, Atheists,
Libertines, and sundry sorts of Heretics besides. The Atheist thinks there
is no resurrection, because he sees no reason for it: to whom, though it were
sufficient to answer with Gregory, Fides non habet meritum, ubi ratio humana
praebet experimentum; and with Saint Ambrose, Credimus piscatoribus, non
dialecticis: yet to reason a little with these unreasonable men in the words of
Saint Paul, Acts 26.8.
Why seems it incredible unto you, that Christ should raise the dead? Is it
not as easy to restore life, as to give it at the first? to raise man out of
ashes, as to create him at first out of the dust? Considera autorem, and toll
dubitationem, says Saint Austine. The Libertine would have no resurrection,
that he might still enjoy the pleasures of sin, and sacrifice to his belly:
but for him there is first a Text of counsel, 1 Cor. 15.34.
Awake to live righteously; and if that will not serve, a Text of judgment,
Phil. 3.19.
Whose end is damnation, whose god is their belly. Of Heretics that
professedly oppugned the doctrine of the resurrection, some taught that there
is no resurrection at all, as the Saduces; some that the resurrection was
already past, as Hymineus and Philetus. Satan is a subtle Serpent, and turns
diverse ways to get in his head. Before Christ's death he worked powerfully in
the children of disobedience; in Judas to betray him, in the Pharisees to
accuse him, in Pilate to condemn him: but after knowing that the time was
come, that the Prince of the world was to be cast out by the death of Christ,
he was much troubled, and labored by all means to hinder Christ's Passion:
Utinam ne in nemore Pelio, he wishes there were no wood in all the world to
make a Cross of: he works remorse in Judas, gives him a halter to hang
himself: he employes Pilates wife to send to her husband, to have nothing to
do with him. When he was fast nailed to the Cross, he sets the Jews
upon him, to see whether they could persuade him to descend from thence. After
this he spreads abroad a rumor, that Simon Cyreneus was crucified for him, or
if he were crucified, that it was but in appearance only, and that he was
falsa pendens in cruce Laureolus: and when his resurrection was so palpable,
that it needed no other argument than the amazement of the watch, and Pilates
letter to the Emperor, he suborned a desperate rout to swear, that his
Disciples stole him away by night. After all this he stirred up certain
Heretics, who taught, that albeit Christ were indeed risen, yet that we were
not to expect any future resurrection, because the resurrection was past
already. But all these shall find, that there is a resurrection for them, to
wit, Resurrectio ad condemnationem. John 5.29.


primogenitus mortuorum, and primitiae dormientium: the first fruits are
carried already into the celestial barn, and the whole crop shall follow. And
this may be a staff of comfort to all drouping and fainting souls, ut tali
exemplo animati, sub ictu passionis, as Cyprian speaks, non retrahant pedem,
that they draw not back, but courageously go on forward to make a good
profession, as being secure, Christi milites, non perimi sed coronari, and
bonam mortem esse quae vitam non perimit, sed adimit ad tempus, restituendam in
tempore, duraturam sine tempore. This was Jobs comfort, I know my Redeemer
lives: and of other distressed ones, who would not be delivered that they
might be partakers of a better resurrection. An ancient father gives these
words for a Christians Motto: Fero, taceo, spero; Fero meam crucem, ut ille
suam: taceo, quia tu, Domine, fecisti: spero, quia utique fructus erit justo.

ye are risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ
sits at the right hand of his Father.

This indeed ought to be so, but we find it otherwise; never more preaching
of the resurrection, and never less fruit. For all seek their own, and none
the things that are Jesus Christ's. So that Bernards observation fitteth our
time: Vides omnem Ecclesiasticum zelum fervere pro sola dignitate tuenda,
honori totum datur, sanctitati nihil: and again, all men learned and unlearned
press to Ecclesiastical cures, Tanquam sine curis quique victuri sint, cum ad
curas pervenerint. The Apostle tells us, Qui Episcopatum desiderat, bonum
opus desiderat: non dignitatem, says Saint Jerome, sed laborem: non delicias,
sed solicitudinem: non crescere fastidiis, sed decrescere humilitate: Nay, not
only opus, but onus also in Saint Bernards judgment, though perhaps some
Atlas's may think they never have load enough. But are the Laity more
excusable, who buy and sell the poor for shoes and gay apparel, and strong
drink? to whom (me thinks) I hear the poor cry, Et vos vanitate peritis,
and nos spoliis perimitis. How many are there of them, who ingrosse the Lords
portion, and bestow hallowed things upon worse than vanity? We have a saying
against them also out of the same Saint Bernard: De patrimonio crucis Christi
non facitis codices in Ecclesia, sed pascitis pellices in thalamis; adornatis
equos, phalerantes pectora, capita deaurantes. Is this our resurrection from
sin? Saint Paul gives this lesson with a memento, Remember, says he, O
Timothy, that Christ is raised from the dead. It is a truth as stable as the
poles of Heaven, that we shall have no part of the second resurrection to the
life of glory, if we have not a good part in the first to the life of grace.

And I have the keys of Death and of Hell. They are well called keys of Hell,
because there are Inferorum portae mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of Saint
Matthew: Matthew. 16.18.
(...). There are many opinions about these keys; some will have them to be
two, Clavis cognitionis, and Clavis authoritatis: but Allensis and the
Schoolmen deny knowledge to be a key, except in an improper speech, Quia
requiritur ad usum clavis; and they do well to deny it: for what key of
knowledge had that Priest, of whom the Master of the Sentences makes mention,
who baptized in nomine Patria, Filia, and Spiritua sancta? Bonaventure
ingenuously confesses, Quidam in Ecclesia habent clavem, quidam claviculam,
quidam nullam. Neither do they stand much upon it; for another of them says,
Dicit Doctor meus, and citat divum Thomam, quod quando Apostoli erant ordinati,
Sacerdotes erant sine scientia. Yet Bernard in his Epistle ad Eugenium makes
knowledge one of the keys, Claves vestras qui sanum sapiunt, alteram in
discretione, alteram in potestate collocant. Ministerium Verbi. The Kingdom of
God is compared to a house, the door of this house is Christ, John 10.7.
the key to open and shut this door is the preaching of the Word: We are the
savor of death unto death unto some, there is the power of binding; to others
of life unto life, there is the power of loosing. He that refuses me, the
word which I have spoken shall judge him, there is the power of binding;
again, The truth shall make you free, there is loosing. But how many soever
the keys be, Christ has them, Non solum authoritative, sed etiam possessive.
What means then Bellarmine in his books de Romano Pontifice to imply, that
the keys remain in Christ's hands only at the vacancy of the Popedom? What a
blasphemy is that of Cusanus, who says, that potestas ligandi and solvendi non
minor est in Ecclesia, quam fuit in Christo? and that of Maldonatus, Christus
Petro vices suas tradidit, ipsamque clavem excellentiae, that key of David,
which opens, and no man shuts? Or if he have not this key so absolutely
as Christ, yet beyond all comparison above other Bishops; they have the keys
of Heaven, sed quodam modo, and with an huc usque licet. Whereupon Petrus de
palude observes, that it was said of them, Quaecunque solveritis in terra,
erunt soluta in coelo: but of Saint Peter, Brunt soluta in coelis. Pardon, I
beseech you, the enlargement of this point; Blasphemiae dies haec est, Rabsakeh
has blasphemed the living God. The Pharisees and Scribes accounted it
blasphemy to attribute forgiveness of sins to any but God. I am he that
blotteth out thine iniquity, says God by the Prophet Esaias: Whereupon Saint
Jerome commenting, says, Solus peccata dimittit, qui pro peccatis mortuus est:
and Saint Austine accords with him, Nemo tollit peccata, nisi solus Deus;
tollit autem dimittendo quae facta sunt, adjuvando ne fiant, and perducendo ad
locum ubi fieri non possunt. What then does the Minister upon confession and
contrition? He pronounces the penitent absolved; or to attribute the most
unto him, he absolveth the person in facie Ecclesiae, remitteth not the sin
absolutely before God. Saint Ambrose shall make up the reckoning: Verbum Dei
dimittit peccata: Sacerdos est Judex, Sacerdos officium exhibet, sed nullius
potestatis jura exercet.

1. Has Christ the keys of death and hell? O then let us kiss the Son,
lest he be angry, and so we perish out of the right way.

2. Has Christ the keys of hell and death? if then we belong to Christ, and
follow his banner, let us not care what death or hell, man or devil can do
against us: Transvectus vada Tartari,
Pacatis redit inferis.
Jam nullus superest timor,
Nil ultra jacet inferos.
Jesus of Nazareth is returned from hell, not as Theseus and Hercules, with a
Cross and a Flagge; but with principalities and powers chained before his
triumphant chariot: he does not now threaten death, as before, O mors, ero tua
mors; but insulteth over it: O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory? Thanks be unto God, who has given us victory, through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Cui, etc.

THE FOURTH ROW.
And in the fourth row a Chrysolite, an Onyx, and a Jasper.
A Jasper is a mixed stone, consisting at least of two kinds of gemmes; and
therefore may not unfitly decipher our Savior, consisting of two natures, who
by inviting all to come unto him, animi constantiam promovet, comfort
fainting spirits; which (as Rueus says) is the virtue of the Chrysolite: after
his invitation promising to secure and rest all burdened and weary souls, he
proves himself an Onyx, wherewith (as Nilus says) the Nobles of Egypt made
supporters for their beds. If we admit the Beryll into this fourth rank,
because it is mentioned with the rest in the Apocalypse, and set here in the
first place by Saint Jerome, Junius, Tostatus, and the Kings Translatours, we
shall lose nothing by the change: for the Beryll (as Abulensis and others
affirm) is of singu^^^ ^ertue to cure waterish and running eyes. True it very
well may be in the stone, but true I am sure i^ (...) ^^e doctrine, which this
stone (according to his rank and my^^^ her division) stands for. This
promise of our Savior, I will eas^ you, is the only Beryll in the world,
which can stay the water of their running eyes, who weep for, and sigh under
the heavy burden of sin. Ye see this fourth order is not out of order, but
sorteth well with the doctrine of the fourth Speaker; and does it not as well
sort with the parts of the Preacher? The Chrysolite is a solid stone, not
spangled or spotted with golden points, as other gems, but as it were gilt all
over; which may well represent the solidity of his proofs, and uniformity of
his whole discourse. The Onyx, a transparent gemme, resembles the perspicuity
of his style; and the Jasper, a stone full of veins, sets before us the
plenty of Scripture sentences, which (like little veins) were diffused through
the whole body of his Sermon; and in respect of these we may more truly say of
it, than To status of the Jasper, Quot venae, tot virtutes, so many veins, so
many virtues.

The embossment of gold, wherein these gemmes of divine doctrine were set, was
his Text, taken out of

A Sermon preached on Easter Tuesday by Master Bates fellow of Trinity
College, afterward Parson of S Clements, and Prebend of Westminster.
MATTHEW. 11.28. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I
will ease you.


MAn at the first was made a goodly creature, in the image of his Maker, having
so near neighborhood with the eternal Majesty, that he dwelt in God, and
God in him: but by his woeful revolt he deprived himself of that sweet
contentment he still should have enjoyed in God, and by his proud rebellion
erected a Babel and partition wall, whereby he debarred himself of the
fruition of him, whom to behold is the height of all that good, any creature
can desire. But man's Creator retaining his love to that which he had made,
though altogether blemished with that which we had done, looked down upon us
with a compassionate eye of his tender mercy, suffered us not (being desirous
of the means of salvation) with bootlesse travells still to wander in
darkness, as strangers from the life of God: but sent from his bosom his word
of truth, light into darkness, who in the fullness of time offered by the
light of his countenance to bring us again to Gods inaccessible brightness,
and by the veil of his flesh not only to shelter us from the scorching flames
of his Fathers fury (as the pillar of cloud did the Israelites from the heat
of the Sun) but also by soliciting our peace, to demolish that partition wall
which we had raised against our selves, and to reunite us again inseparably
to him, from whom we had rent and dissevered our selves, crying in the midst
of you as you hear, Come unto me, etc. The voice of God, and not of man, or
rather of the eternal wisdom, which was God and man.

In these words, which I term Ch^^sts Proclamation of grace and peace to all
soule-sicke sinners, we may note, 1. An invitation, Come unto me. 2. The
reward of our obedience, I will ease you.


In the first part note we, 1. The party inviting, Christ. 2. The thing he
advises to, Come. 3. The object to whom, Me. 4. The parties that are envited
singled out by their qualities, all that are weary and heavy laden.


In the second part note we, 1. The party promising, I. 2. The reward it
self, ease and rest, will ease you.


Here then you see, 1. Love inviting, Come. 2. Truth directing, To me. 3.
Necessity inciting, All that are weary. 4. Reward alluring, And I will ease
you. 1. Love inviteth, that we fear not to come. 2. Truth directs, that we
err not in coming. 3. Necessity inciteth, that we slack not to come. 4.
Reward sustaineth, that we faint not in coming.



Come. Venite, fides exigitur, studium desideratur, says Saint Ambrose. Christ
his proselytes life must not be as his confidence in Esaias, chapt. 30. in ease
and quietness: Ver. 15.
for then Moab-like he will soon settle on his lees, and have his taste
remaining in him, Jerem. 48.11. The Caldean Sagda (as Solinus reports) by the
spirit enclosed in it, rises from the bottom of Euphrates, and so closely
sticks to the boards of the ships that pass that river, that without
slivering of some part of the bark it cannot be severed; so sin by the power
of the evil spirit arising from the bottomless pit of perdition, adhereth so
fast to us, that till our brittle Barks of flesh be slivered off, this Sagda
of sin, can never be removed, but like Dejanira's poisoned shirt, -- Qua
trahitur, trahit illa cutem. And therefore this sore travel God has allotted
to all the sons of Adam, from the first time they become newborn babes in
Christ, till they breath out their languishing souls into the hands of their
Redeemer, to wrestle with their inbred corruptions, and to seek to shake off
the sin which hangs on so fast; that howsoever it cannot be altogether
dis-severed before we are dissolved; yet it may not be a Remora to our ships,
much less get such strength as to overruled us. Howbeit, because the flesh is
weak, where the spirit is most ready, and the spirit it self is not so ready
as it should be, because the faculties thereof through the malignity of sin
are much imbezelled, God spares not by frequent Scriptures to stir us up to
go on, and traverse the way of his commandments: some to rowze us up from
sleep, as, Awake thou that sleep, Ephesians. 5.14.
and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Some to incite
us to go on forward when we are raised, Hebr. 12.14.
as, Follow peace and holiness, without which no man shall see God. Some to
encourage us that we faint not, as, Be not weary of well doing: for in due
time ye shall reap if ye faint not. Once indeed it was said to the
Israelites, Galat. 6.9.
Stand still, and behold the salvation of God: but now, Come, behold, and stand
not still, if you desire the salvation of God. Now no more sit still, as it was
once said to the daughter of Babel; but arise and depart: for here is no
resting place. Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending, but none standing or
sitting on the ladder. There are many rounds in our Jacobs ladder, whereby we
climb to the Mount of God: Non debemus pigri remanere, non debemus superbi
cadere, says Saint Austine. Paul that honorable vessel of God, though he
laid so fast hold on Christ by faith, and was so knit to him by love, that he
challenges all powers in heaven and earth to try if they were able to
separate him from the love of his Redeemer (Romans 8. Ver. 35.) yet reckoning
with himself as if he had not comprehended him of whom he was comprehended,
he forgot that which was behind, and followed hard to the mark, for the
price of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ. So true is that of Saint
Bernard, Ubi incipis nolle fieri melior, ibi desinis esse bonus.

Seek ye my face, thy soul answer, Thy face, Lord, will I seek: if when
Christ sounds his Venite, thy heart springing for joy resound David's Ecce,
Lo I come; and thy spirit so outstrip the slow motions of thy sluggish flesh,
that with the Spouse in the Canticles thou desire to be drawn after him; then
be thou assured, that this is the finger of God. For no man can come to
Christ, but he whom the Father draws.

Come, we hearken to it, and for Hippomanes golden balls we refuse to follow
Christ: if when the Devil says, Come, we listen to his lure, and for his
omnia tibi dabo, bow to his will: if when the flesh says, Come, we trudge to
it, and for lascivious lulling in Dalila's lap, we renounce him who calls us
to be his Nazarites: these unsanctified affections blab out our inward
corruptions, and we show our selves to be the worlds darlings, the Devils
pesants, and the fleshes slaves, not Christ's sheep. For if it be true, Omnis
qui didicit venit, quisquis non venit, profecto non didicit, as Saint Austine
rightly infers.

Unto me. Now follows the happy terminus ad quem of our spiritual motions:
Satius est claudicare in via, quam currere extra viam; halting Jacob will
sooner limpe to his journies end, than swift-footed Napthali posting speedily
out of the way. Therefore, lest when God calls us, we should with Samuel
run to Eli, or linger our coming for fear of mistaking, the Way himself
chalketh us out the path of salvation, saying, Come to me. Four sorts of men
seem to come to Christ, yet come not as they should: The first begin to come,
but they fall short in their way; and these are Temporizers, who with Peter
stand aloof, and dare not come near, lest by continual conversation with him
they might perhaps so alter their licentious lives, that in the high Priests
Hall their speech might bewray them to be Galileans. A second sort come, but
in their coming wander out of the way, and these are misled Papists, who in a
sottish modesty dare not presume to touch the hemme of Christ his garments; but
must have Saints to promote their suites. A third sort come, but a clean
contrary way, and these are meale-mouthed hypocrites, whose words seem to be
sweetened with our Saviors breath, they are so savoury: but compare we the
forwardness of their lives in practice, to the forwardness of their tongues
in profession, and if ye were as blind as old Isaac, ye may discern the
voice of Jacob, but the hands of Esau. The fourth sort come, but they
over-shoot the way, and these are Humorists, who with Saint Peter in unadvised
zeal over-runne themselves, and step before Christ; but be not like unto
these: for they want Saint Paul's ita currite for the level of their way, and
Christ his venite for the period of their race. Come unto me, not to the Law,
not to man's traditions, they will rather burden you than ease you. Ambulare
vis? ego sum via: falli non vis? ego sum veritas: mori non vis? ego sum vita:
Accedit qui credit, Come unto me in faith, and fear not; in hope, and doubt
not; in confidence, and despair not; in patience, and faint not.

in whom all the promises of GOD are Yea and Amen: for under heaven there is no
other name given, whereby ye may be saved, but the name of Jesus Christ.
There is one God, one Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Christ Jesus. Be
it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through his name is
preached unto you forgiveness of sins, and from all things from which by the
Law of Moses ye could not be justified, by him every one that comes unto
him is justified: for so himself promises, Come unto me.

All. There was a time when the mercies of God were confined within the narrow
precincts of Judea; but when the fullness of time was come, the Son of God
and heir of all things brake down the partition wall, and dispread his saving
health among all Nations, teaching and admonishing every man to deny
ungodliness, and embrace the Gospel. For the righteousness of God is made
manifest by faith to all. There is no difference, but as all sinned in the
first Adam, and deprived themselves of the glory of God, so redemption is
freely offered to all in the second Adam, that sinners should give all the
glory to God: Ideo omnibus opem sanitatis obtulit, ut quicunque perierit mortis
suae causam sibi ascribat, qui curari noluit, cum remedium haberet, quo posset
evadere, says Sain Ambrose: Say not then in thine heart, I am not the cause of
my destruction, (...), injurious blasphemy against so good a God, who so
willingly holds out his golden Scepter of grace unto us, and so graciously
inviteth all that are weary to rest under the shadow of his mercy. Funeris
haud tibi causa fui per sidera juro.

As I live (says the Lord) I desire not the death of a sinner: thy destruction
is from thy self, O Israel, but in me is thy help. But if all are invited,
why do not all come? Some like the Israelites, filled with the garlike of
Egypt, relish not heavenly manna: others, like the Laodiceans, think they are
rich enough, when indeed they are wretched, miserable, and poor. Whence it
comes to pass, that as of many multitudes in Saul's army only a few bankrupt
beggars came to David in the cave of Adullam; so none come to Christ but a few
sinne-feeling Publicans, troubled Hannaes, weeping Mary's, bedridden Aeneases,
leprous Naamans: in a word, none but such as are poor in spirit, and vexed in
mind with enduring the heavy burden of sin.

All that are weary and heavy laden. How heavy a burden sin is, if any man's
wounded conscience have not felt, he may perceive it in the Angels, whom it
pressed down to hell; in Cain, whom it drove to despair; in David, whom it so
bruised, that he cried out, it is a burden too heavy for me to bear: in our
Savior, from whom it wrung drops of blood, only for taking our sin upon him:
Why then do we take so great pains to do wickedly? why do we mumble
Satan's morsels, which will one day prove more bitter than the gall of Aspes,
and more tormenting than the Vipers tongue? Are we now speechless? can we
not now answer these demands? how then shall we do, when not only our
consciences shall accuse us, but God also, who is greater than our conscience,
shall condemn us? Issachars legacy was, that he should be an Ass couching
between two burdens: Surely if he were, he might have been like Balaams Ass,
to rebuke our forwardness; who load our selves with sin, till with the woman
in the Gospel we are so crooked, that we are not able to look up to the hills
from whence comes our salvation. Saint Paul chose rather with his hands to
cast out the tackling of the ship, than that being over-laden it should sink:
and shall not we unlade our barks of sin, for fear that with Hymineus and
Philetus we make shipwreck of a good conscience? Aristippus commanded his
servants to cast away his gold in the street, quia tardius irent segnes propter
pondus: and shall not we be content with Eliah, to leave our mantles behind
us, that we may with more expedition be carried to heaven in triumph? Virtutis
via non capit magna onera portantes.

But why do we teach that sin is a burden, since so many go bolt upright
under it, and make it a passe-time? Onus non est quod cum voluprate feras,
says the Orator. I answer, sin is a burden not to every one at all times,
but to a conscience feeling sins evil; Multa mala sunt intus, for as nemo
tamen ea sentit, nisi qui graditur viam mandatorum Dei, says Saint Austine; so
long as the strong man rules the house, he possesses all things in peace:
grave in suo loco non gravitat, they who are dead in sin feel no weight how
great soever it be.

Epiphanius says, a wild fig tree rooted in our hearts, which sprouteth out
in our words, and shows the fruit thereof in our works; if the fruit thereof
seem sweet unto us, if the grapes of Sodom delight our eyes, if the burden of
sin seem not only supportable to us, but also as an ornament to beautify
us; well may we like the Church of Sardis have a name that we live, but we are
dead; we are in the gall of bitterness, and the burden of sin has pressed
us down to the bottomless pit, which is now ready to shut her mouth upon us.
O then let us cr^ out of the depth, abyssus abyssum invocet, let the depth of
our misery implore the depth of his bottomless mercy, and behold the Angel of
peace is at hand: for now, and never before, are we fit subjects for this good
Samaritan to work upon; Come unto me all that are heavy laden. The Spirit of
God is upon me to preach health to those that are broken in heart, liberty to
the captives, and to them that mourn beauty for ashes, and the garment of
gladness for the spirit of heaviness: whence you see, that none are admitted
into Christ's Hospital but lame, sick, and distressed wretches, for whom he
has received grace above measure, that where sin appeared above measure
sinful, grace might appear without measure pitiful. Will thou then have thy
wounds healed? open them. Will thou that I raise thee up to heaven? deject thy
self down to hell: Ille laudabilior qui humilior, justior qui sibi abjectior.

discover the filthiness that lies in the skirts of Jerusalem, but sow
pillowes under men's elbowes, and dawbe up with untempered mortar the breach of
sin in our souls; Bezaliel and Aholiab to cut off the rough and ragged
knobs, as they desire to be smooth timber in that building, wherein Christ
Jesus is the cornerstone: poenitentia istius temporis dolor medicinalis est,
poenitentia illius temporis dolor poenalis est; now our sorrow for our sins
will prove a repentance not to be repented of, then shall our sorrow be
remediless, our repentance fruitless, our misery endless. Wherefore I say
with Bernard, Illius Doctoris vocem libenter audio, qui non sibi plausum, sed
mihi planctum moveat: I like him that will set the worm of conscience on
gnawing, while there is time to choke it; rodat putredinem ut codendo
consumat, and ipse pariter consumatur. In the mean time let this be our
comfort, that God will not suffer the sting of conscience too much to torment
us, but with the oil of his grace will mitigate the rage of the pain, and
heal the festred sore which it has made, with the plaster of his own blood.

And I will ease you. Thus far you have traversed the wilderness of Sin,
tired out in that desert, and languishing in that dry land and shadow of death:
now behold gaudium in fine, sed sine fine. Happy your departure out of Egypt,
and blessed your travel and obedience: you are now to drink of the
comfortable waters that issue out of the spiritual rock in Horeb, Christ
Jesus, and to refresh your wearied limbs and tired souls therewith: I will
ease you.

I. Man cannot; for man is a sinner, and a sinner cannot be a Savior: Angels
cannot; for man in Angels nature cannot be punished: God cannot; for he is
impassible: Saints neither may nor can; for they need a Savior: but I will.
For I am man, and in your nature can dye; I am God, and by any infinite merits
can satisfy: and so by my means Gods mercy and justice may stand together,
righteousness and peace may kiss each other. Thus that faith may look out of
the earth to embrace you, the day-springing from on high has visited you.
Thrice blessed then must poor hunger-bit and distressed souls be, who have
not a churlish Nabal with power wanting will, nor a King of Samaria with will
wanting power; but Elshaddai, a God all-sufficient, to relieve and satisfy
them; and for his will, no Assuerus so ready to cheer up a doleful Hester, as
he a drouping soul: no Joseph so ready to sustain his father in famine and
death, as he is ready with pity to save a soul from death. Noli fugere Adam
quia nobiscum est Deus. Who shall lay any thing to our charge, since it is God
that does justify? Pleasant and sweet were the waters of Meribah to the
thirsty Israelites, of Aenochore to Sampsons fainting spirits, grateful the
news of life to sick Hezekiah; but our Saviors Epiphonema, thy sins are
forgiven thee, go in peace, is mel in ore, melos in aure, jubilum in cord.
The strings of my tongue cannot be so loosened, that I may express the ecstasy
of joy which every sin-burdened soul feels, whether in the body or out of
the body she cannot tell, in that by assurance of faith she can say, My
Justifier is with me, who being Emmanuel, God with us, is also (...), man with
God; one with God in will and power, and wholly for us in power and will.

forsaking the fountain of living water, dig to themselves broken pits of
their own merits, Saints intercession, and the Churches treasury. Is there no
balm in Gilead to cure us? no God in Israel to help us? Si verax Deus qui
promittit, mendax utique homo qui diffidit, says St. Bernard. For I demand,
Do they distrust his power? All power is given him in heaven and in earth,
Matthew. 28.18. Do they doubt his will? Behold he says, Come unto me (before we
offer our selves) and I will ease you, not do my best, or endeavor: it is no
presumption to believe Christ on his word, and rest on it with full assurance.

I will ease you? How hopeless then is their travel, how endless their
pain, who seek for hearts-ease in any garden but the Paradise of God, or hope
for contentment in any transitory object the world affords? To see Asses
feed upon thistles for grapes, were enough to move the spleen of an Agelastus:
they have a fair show like flowers, but prick in the mouth. Alas, what
anguish and horror must there needs be Cum domus interior gemitu miseroque
tumultu Miscetur. when their consciences, like Saul's evil spirit, haunteth and
vexes them at the heart, when they brave it out in the face? and what is their
foolish laughter among their boon associates, but the cracking of thorns
under a pot, suddenly extinguished and turned into ashes and mourning? Well may
they, like the heathenish Romans of old, have their gods of fear and terror,
but sure they can have none of ease, comfort or quiet. O let not our soul
enter into their secrets, but let our peace be still as it is in God, and the
repose of our troubled conscience in our Saviors love, who was made a curse
for us, that the blessing of Abraham might come upon us: let us enter into the
Arc of our confidence, and the Spirit of Christ, like Noah's Dove, shall bring
unto us an Olive branch, glad tidings of peace, and true signs of rest to our
tempest-tossed consciences: let us draw near to God, and he will draw near to
us: let us go to Christ, and he will draw God near unto us: let us go unto
him in fear and reverence, and he will embrace us; in faith and confi^ence,
and he will receive us: though we have been prodigal and runnagate children,
he will receive us into his favor, he will reconcile us to his Father, he will
salve our wounds, he will quiet our hearts, he will mitigate our fear of
death and destruction, and he will imparadise us with himself in glory
everlasting.

The spiritual and moral interpretation of the Rehearsers text, with a
conclusion of the whole.
THus have I now at length presented to your spiritual view the breast plate of
Aaron, decked richly with four rows of precious stones, set in bosses of
gold. To the four rows I have compared the four methodicall Sermons which
ye have heard; the Jewels in the rows both to the parts of the Speakers, and
to their precious doctrine, the embossement of gold to their texts: Orat. pro
Cluent.
now because as Cepasius in Tullie, postquam diu ex intimo artificio dixisset
respicite, respicite, tandem respexit ipse: so it has been the manner of the
Rehearsers, after they had fitly resembled the Preachers, to make some
resemblance of themselves and their office. Sacra haec non aliter constant.

I entreat you, right worshipful, men, fathers, and brethren, not to think
that I have so far forgotten modesty, as to rank my self with the meanest of
the Jewels in these rows, nor the texture of my discourse to the embossements
of gold wherein they were set: yet not quite to change the allegory, I find
among the Lapidaries a stone which seems to me a fit emblem of a Rehearser;
it is no precious stone, though it be reckoned with them by Plin. l. 37. c. 9.
Pliny and others, because at some times it represents the colors of the
rainebow, non ut in se habeat colores arcus coelestis, sed ut repercussu
parietum illidat: the name of the stone is Iris: whereunto I may make bold to
compare my self, because in some sort I have represented unto you the
beautiful colors of these twelve precious stones, as the Iris does the
colors of the Rainebow; non per inhaerentiam, sed per referentiam: and
therefore I reflect all the luster, splendor, and glory of them, first, upon
Almighty God, next upon the Jewels (the Preachers) themselves. Pliny makes
mention of a strange Not. hist. l. 2. c. 105. Pluvius in Hispania est, qui
omnes aurei coloris ostendit pisces, nihil extra illam aquam caeteris
differentes
River in Spain, wherein all the fish while they swim in it have a golden
color, but if you take them out of it, nothing at all differ in color from
other: in like manner, I doubt not but that many things seemed excellent and
truly golden in the torrent of the Preachers eloquence, which, taken out
thence, and exhibited to you in my rehearsal, seem but ordinary. Howbeit, the
whole blame hereof lies not upon me, but a great part of it upon the very
nature of this exercise, to which it is Mat. 3.3.
essential to be defective. The Preachers were voices like St. John Baptist,
the Rehearser is but the Echo. Who ever expected of an Echo to repeat the
whole voice, or entire speech? sufficient it is that it resound some of the
last words, and them imperfectly: it implies a contradiction, that a fair and
goodly picture should be drawn at length in a short table: Quintil. instit.
orat. l. 10. c. 2. Quicquid alteri simile est, necesse est ut sit minus eo quod
imitatur, ut umbra corpore imago facie, and actus histrionum veris affectibus:
necesse est ut semper sit posterior qui sequitur.
The shadow always comes short of the body, the image of the face, imitation
of nature. If I should have given due accents to each of their words and
sentences, I should long ago have lost my spirits; and I may truly say with
St. Paul, though in another sense, 2 Cor. 2.10.
What I have spared herein, for your sake have I spared as well as for mine
own, to ease you of much trouble; and now, after a very short explication and
application of mine own text, I will ease you of all.

Joseph. antiq. Jud. l. 3. c. 8.
Josephus works with his wit a glorious allegory upon Aarons garments: The
Miter (says he) represented the Heaven, the two Onyxes the Sun and Moon,
the four colors in the embroidered Ephod the four Elements, the Girdle the
Ocean, the Bells and Pomegranates thundering and lightening in the air, the
four rows of stones the four parts of the year, the twelve stones the
twelve signs in the Zodiac, or the twelve months in the year. St. Ep. 128.
Quatuor ordines quatuor puto esse virtutes, Prudentiam Fortitudinem, Justitiam,
Temperantiam etc.
Jerome takes the four rows for the four cardinal virtues, which,
subdivided into their several species, make up the full number of twelve.
Although I dare not with Origin run riot in allegories, yet I make no
question but that we ought to conceive of the Ephod, not as of a vestment only
covering the Priests breast, but as of a holy type or figure vailing under it
many celestial mysteries; and esteem the stones set in these rows upon the
Ephod as precious, or rather more in their signification than they are in their
nature. In which respect they may be termed, after a sort, so many glorious
Sacraments, since they are visible signs of invisible mysteries, which I am now
to declare unto you. St. Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrews proves manifestly
Aaron to be a type of Christ, his actions of Christ's passion; whereunto we may
add his ornaments of Christ's offices, Kingly, Priestly, and Prophetical. For
he is our Hermes Trismegistus; Mercurius Termaximus.
Hermes, because he is the Interpreter and Declarer of Gods will; and
Trismegistus, that is, thrice greatest, because he is the greatest King, the
greatest Priest, and the greatest Prophet that ever came into the world. The
Mitre, Diadem-like, compassed, as Josephus writes, with three circles like a
triple Crown, apparently seems to me to prefigure the Kingly office of our
Savior, whereby he sits gloriously in the heart of all the Elect, ruling
them by the golden Scepter of his word; As evidently the front-plate of pure
gold, engraven with holiness to the Lord, and breast plate with Urim and
Thummim, represents Christ's Priestly function; according to which he bears
the twelve Tribes, representing all his Elect before God for a remembrance, and
presents their prayers, and them, and himself for them, to his Father. For,
that Thummim, that is, perfections, is an empress becoming none but our
Saviors breast, all Christians will easily grant; and that Urim, that is,
lights, are an Emblem of the divine nature, Plato professes, saying, Lumen
est umbra Dei, and Deus est lumen luminis, Light is the shadow of God, and God
is the light of light it self. For, Christ his third office we need not go
far to seek it; for the Bells of Aaron sound out the preaching of the word,
and the Pomegranates set before us the fruits thereof, and both his entire
Propheticke function. If there lie any mystery hid in the numbers, we may
conceive the four rows of shining stones answerable to the four Beasts in
the Revelation, full of eyes, either prefigured by four Evangelists, or the
four orders in the Church Hierarchy, Apostles, Evangelists, Doctors, and
Pastors: as for the twelve stones, doubtless they had some reference to the
twelve Apostles; for in the 21. chapter of the Apoc. 21.14.
Revelation, where these twelve precious stones are mentioned, it is said
expressly, that in the wall there were twelve foundations garnished with all
manner of precious stones, and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the
Lamb.

You have heard the mystical interpretation; lend I beseech you an ear to the
moral.

1. First, these glorious vestments and ornaments of Aaron set forth unto us
the dignity of the Priests office: 2 Cor. 3.7, 8.
and if the ministration of the letter were glorious, shall not the
ministration of the Spirit be much more? Yes, how dark and vile soever our
calling seems to the eyes of the world, it shall one day appear most
glorious, when they that turn many unto Dan. 12.3.
righteousness shall shine as stars in the firmament for evermore.

Here I cannot conceal from you, that In Exo. c. 28.
Cappo one of the Popes Botchers takes measure of Aarons garments, to make
massing vestments by: as before him Durand has done in his book entitled
rationale divinorum, where he says, Noster Pontifex habet pro feminalibus
sandalia, pro linea albam, pro balieo cingulum, pro podere tunicam, pro Ephod
stolam, pro rationali pallium, pro cidari mitram, pro lamina crucem: just; but
where is the causible? in Latin casula, sic dicta, quasi parva casa, says
he, because it closes the Priest round as it were with a wall, having a hole
for him to put out his head, like a Lover, to let out smoke, signifying, that
the Priest ought to be like a little cottage with a chimney in it, heated with
the fire of zeal, sending up hot fumes of devotion, and letting them out with
his breath at the LOVER of his mouth. But I will not put them to so hard a
task, as to parallel each of their vestments with Aarons: all that I shall say
to them for the present is this, That the nearer they prove their vestments to
come to Aarons ornaments, the more ceremonial and typical they prove them;
and consequently, more unfit to be retained now by Christians, if the Apostles
argument drawn from the Heb. 10.1.
vanishing of the shadow at the presence of the body be of any force: therefore
let the observation of Cappo pass with a note of plumbea falsitas, not aurea
veritas, wherewith he graceth it.

2. My second observation is, that God both first begins with the breast,
and appoints also the most glorious and precious ornaments for it: Exodus 28.4.
The garments shall be these; thou shall make a breast plate, an Ephod, etc.
after follows the mitre, to the making whereof blew silk only and fine
twined linen is required, with a plate of gold on it; but for the
breast plate, cloth of gold wrought about with diverse colors, plates of gold,
and four ranks of the richest jewels in all the treasury of nature are
appointed: all this, as we may piously conceive, to signify, that God best
esteems the breast and heart, and not the head: My Pro. 23.26.
son, give me thy heart. Our heavenly Father prefers enflamed affections
above enlightened thoughts: he cannot be received or entertained in our narrow
understanding, yet will he Ephesians. 3.17.
dwell in our hearts by faith, if we enlarge them by love. Cecidit Lucifer,
Seraphim stant aeterna incommutabilitate, and incommutabili aeternitate, the
Angels which had their names from light fell like lightening from heaven; but
the ministering spirits, which are by interpretation burning fire, hold yet
their place and rank in the Court of God. Let ambitious spirits seek to shine
in Aarons mitre, or at least to be caracter'd in the Onyx stones on his
shoulders: my hearts desire was, and ever shall be to be engraven in one of the
jewels upon the breast plate, to hang with the beloved Disciple upon the
bosom of my Savior.

3. Thirdly, I observe yet again, that the names of the twelve tribes, which
were before written in the Onyx stones upon the shoulders of Aaron, are here
engraven again in the rows of jewels hanging near his heart: which, as it
represents Christ his both supporting and affecting his chosen; supporting
them on his shoulders, and affecting them in his heart: so it teaches all the
Ministers of the Gospel to bear the names of Gods people committed to their
charge, not only upon their shoulders, by supporting their infirmity; but also
upon their hearts, Ver. 29. by entirely affecting them above others; and above
all things Gods glory in the salvation of their souls. If John 21.15.
thou love me, says Christ, feed my sheep; if you desire that Christ should
bear you on his heart before his Father, bear you the names of his Tribes
(his chosen) on your hearts before him.

4. Fourthly, you may easily discern, that the stones, as they are of sundry
kinds, and of different value, so they are set in diverse rows, 1. 2. 3. 4.
which illustrateth unto us the diverse measures of grace given to believers in
this life, and their different degrees of glory in the life to come. All the
stones that were placed on Aarons breast plate were Urim and Thummim, that is,
resplendent and perfect jewels; yet all were not equal: some were richer and
above others in value, as those in the second row; even so all the elect are
dear to our Savior, yet some are dearer than others: he entirely affected all
the Apostles, yet Saint John, who John 21.20.
leaned upon his breast, was nearer to him than any of the other: all the
Jewels were set in gold in their embossements, yet one was set above another;
in like manner all the faithful shall shine as stars in the firmament, yet
some shall be set in a higher sphere than others: for as the Apostle teaches
us, there is 1 Cor. 15.41.
one glory of the Sun, and another of the Moon, and another of the Stars;
for one Star differs from another in glory, and so shall be the
resurrection of the dead.

5. Fifthly, look ye yet nearer upon these shining stones, and ye shall
find, that they will not only delight and lighten the eyes of your
understanding; but also heat and inflame your devout affections. They are as
twelve precious books, wherein you may read many excellent lessons printed
with indeleble characters. You see clearly here the names of each of the Tribes
in several engraven; let your marginall note be, God has from all eternity
decreed a certain number of Elect to be saved, and he has written their
names in several in the book of life.

6. Sixthly, observe that the names of the Tribes are not written in paper, nor
carved in wood, but engraven in solid and precious stones with the point of a
Diamond, never to be razed out: let your interlineary gloss be, None of those
whose names are written in the book of life can be stricken out. For there is
no blotting, interlining, nor variae lectiones in that book; stars there are,
but no obeliskes: the Elect therefore though they may fall grievously and
dangerously, yet not totally nor finally. Stella cadens non est stella, cometa
fuit. Were you, beloved, but embossed or enammeled in the ring upon our
Saviors finger, you were safe enough; for no man can pluck any thing out of
our Saviors hand: but now that you are engraven as signets on our Saviors
heart, what can be your fear? what may be your joy?

Is it so? does our high Priest set us on his heart? and shall not we set our
heart on him? shall we esteem any thing too dear for him, who esteems us so
dear unto him? He who once upon the Cross shed his heart blood for us, still
bears us upon his heart, and esteems of us as Cornelia did of her Gracchi,
and presents us as it were in her words to his Father, Haec sunt ornamenta
mea, these be my jewels.

Does he make such reckoning of us? and is it our desire he should do so? then
for the love of our Redeemer let us not so dishonor him, as to fill the rows
of his breast plate with glass in stead of jewels; let us not make him present
to his Father either counterfeit stones through our hypocrisy, or dusky
through earthlinesse and worldly corruption; let us rub, scowre, and brighten
the good graces of God in us, that they may shine in us, and we may be such as
our Savior esteems us to be, that is, orient and glorious jewels.

The sum of all is this: Ye have heard of four rows of precious stones set
in bosses of gold upon Aarons breast plate; and by the four rows you
understand the four well ordered and methodicall Sermons by me rehearsed: by
the jewels, either the eminent parts of the Preachers, or their precious
doctrines: by the embossments of gold, in which these precious gems of divine
doctrine were set, their texts: nothing remains but that the breast plate
being made, you put it on; and as Aaron did, bear it on your hearts. By
wearing and bearing it there, you shall receive virtue from it, and in some
sort participate of the nature of these jewels; in modesty of the Ruby, in
chastity of the Emrald, in purity of the Onyx, in temperance of the Amethyst,
in ardent love of the Carbuncle, in invincible constancy of the Adamant, in
sacrificing your dearest hearts blood and affections to Christ, and in passion
for him (if you be called thereunto) of the Hematite. You shall gloriously
beautify the breast plate of our Aaron, who has put on his glorious apparel,
and sacred robes, and is entered into the Sanctum Sanctorum in heaven, and at
this time bears our names on his breast for a remembrance before God his
father; and long it shall not be ere he come from thence, and all eyes shall
Apoc. 1.7.
see him, and all kindreds of the earth shall mourn before him: then shall he
say to us, Lift up your heads, look upon my breast, read every one your name
engraven in a rich jewel. You were faithful unto death: therefore see here
now I give you a crown of life; behold in it for every Christian virtue a
jewel, for every penitent tear Crystal and Pearl, for every green and blew
wound or stripe endured for me an Emrald and a Saphir, for every drop of blood
shed for the Gospel a Ruby and an Hematite: wear this for my sake, and reign
with me for evermore, Cui, etc.

THE DEVOUT SOULS MOTTO, A Sermon preached in Saint Peter's Church in Lent;
Anno 1613. THE XXXVI. SERMON.
PSALM. 73.25. Whom have I in heaven but thee, O Lord? and there is none upon
earth that I desire besides thee.


Right Worshipful, etc.
THe words which our Luke 12.49.
Savior spoke concerning the issue and success of his preaching, may serve
fitly for a preface to my intended discourse upon this Text: Ignem veni
missurus inter vos* and quid volo nisi ut accendatur? I come to put fire among
you, or rather in you: and what is my desire, but that by the blasts and
motions of Gods Spirit, and the breath of my mouth it may presently be
kindled, and burn in your hearts? Burn it will not without fuel; take heed
therefore, says In opusc. Cave ne injicias quod fumum aut foetorem ministret.
Bonaventure, what you cast into this fire to feed the flame: for if it be
gross, impure, and earthy matter, the flame will be obscure, and the fume
unsavory; but if it be refined, pure, and celestial, the flame will be
clear, and the fume a sweet perfume in the nostrils of Almighty God. Nadab and
Levit. 10.1.
Abihu smoaked themselves for offering strange fire upon Gods Altar: but we
are like to burn in unquenchable fire, if we offer not continually the fire I
am now to treat of, upon the Altar of our hearts: and yet it is a strange fire
too; for it gives light, yet burns not; or rather it burns, yet consumes
not; or rather it consumes, yet impaires not, but dilateth and enlarges the
heart. Other fire burns black, and marreth the beauty of the body; but this
contrariwise gives beauty to the soul. for as Saint Mor. in Job l. 18. Non
clarescit anima fulgore aeternae pulchritudinis, nisi hic arserit in officina
charitatis.
Gregory rightly observes, the soul shines not with the brightness of
everlasting beauty, that burns not in the forge of charity. With this beauty
God is so enamoured, that Saint De dilig. Deo. Major est in amore Dei, qui
plures traxerit ad amorem Dei.
Bernards observation is true, that he is greatest in favor, and in the love
of God, who draws most to the love of God. If we desire to know, says Saint
Aug. Enchirid. ad Laurent. c. 117.
Austine, what a man is, we enquire not what he believes, or what he hops
for, but what he loves. A man may believe the truth, and be a false man: he
may hope for good things, and yet be exceeding bad himself; but he cannot love
the best things, but he must needs be good: he cannot affect grace, if he have
not received some measure thereof; he cannot highly esteem of God, and not be
high in Gods esteem. As the love of the world makes a man worldly, and the
love of the flesh fleshly; so the love of the Spirit makes the children of God
spiritual, and the love of God partaker of the divine 2 Pet. 1.4.
nature: for God is love. Now, says Saint Paul, that is, in this life, abides
1 Cor. 13.13.
faith, hope, and charity; but after this life, of these three charity only
remains. For when we have received the end of our faith, which is the
salvation of our souls, and taken possession of the inheritance which we have
so long expected by hope, faith shall be swallowed up in vision, and hope in
fruition; but then love shall be in greatest perfection. Our trust is, that we
shall not always walk by faith, and our hope is, that we shall one day hope no
more; we believe the end of faith, and hope for the end of hope; but love no
end of our love: but contrariwise desire, that it may be like the sovereign
object thereof, that is, eternal and infinite. To leap over this large field
at once, and comprise all in one sentence concerning this virtue, of which
never enough can be said: Love brought God from heaven to earth; love brings
men from earth to heaven. In which regard it may not be unfitly compared to the
ladder, at the foot whereof Genesis 28.12.
Jacob slept sweetly, and in his dream saw Angels climbing up by it to heaven.
For upon it the religious soul of a devout Christian rests and reposeth her
self; and by it in her thoughts and desires she ascends up to heaven, as it
were by four steps or rounds, which are the four degrees of divine love. 1.
To love God for our selves. 2. To love God for himself. 3. To love God above
all things. 4. To love nothing but God, or in a reference to him.


First, to love God for our selves or our own respect, whereunto we are
induced by the consideration of his benefits and blessings bestowed upon us,
and continued unto us.

The second is to love God for himself, whereunto we are moved by the
contemplation of the divine essence, and his most amiable nature.

The third is to love God above all things, whereunto we are inclined by
observation of the difference between God and all things else.

The fourth is to love nothing but God, that is, to settle our affections, and
repose our desires, and place our felicity wholly and solely in him. To which
highest round or step of divine love and top of Christian perfection we aspire,
by fixing our thoughts upon the all sufficiency of God, who has in him
infinite delights and contentments to satisfy all the appetites of the soul;
whereof the Kingly Prophet David was fully persuaded, when lifting up his heart
to God, and his eyes to heaven, he calls God himself to witness, that he
desired no other happiness than what he enjoyed in him, saying,

Whom have I in heaven but thee? These words may admit ^f a double
construction: 1 Either that David makes God his sole refuge and trust: 2 Or
that he makes him his chief joy and whole hearts delight.


For the first sense, viz. Whom have I in heaven but thee for my refuge, and
strength of my confidence? we are to know that in heaven and in earth there are
other besides God; in heaven the elect Angels, and the spirits of Heb. 12.23.
just men made perfect; in earth there are men and the creatures: yet a
religious soul reposeth no confidence in any of these. First, not in the
creature in general, for it is Romans 8.20.
subject to vanity: not in riches, for 1 Timothy 6.17.
they are uncertain; Charge the rich in this world that they trust not in
uncertain riches: not in Jer. 9.23.
wisdom, or strength, or power; nor in the favor of Psalm. 146.3.
Princes, nor any child of man, for there is no help in them. I will yet
ascend higher, even to heaven, and to the Angels and souls there. For
whatsoever power, or strength, or help may be in them, we may not put our
trust in them. 1 Not in the souls of Saints departed; for they Esaias 63.16.
take no notice of our affairs here, neither have we any order to address our
selves to them: Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledges us not: 2
Kin. 22.20.
Good Josiah sees not the evil which befell his subjects after his death. 2
Not in Angels; for though they excel in strength, and are ministering Heb. 1.14.
Spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation, yet
we have no charge to worship them, or rely upon them for our salvation. Nay,
we are charged to the contrary, both from God and from themselves; from God,
Mat. 4.10.
Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve: and, Col.
2.18.
Let no man beguile you in voluntary humility, and worshipping of Angels: and
from themselves also, Apoc. 19.10. and 22.9.
And I fell down at the feet of the Angel that showed me these things, and he
said unto me, See thou do it not, I am thy fellow servant, worship God.

For the second sense, viz. Whom have I in heaven but thee for my chief joy
and sole hearts delight? we are to know that the faithful soul is wedded to
God, and like a loyal Spouse casts no part of her conjugall affection upon
any but him. Love she may whom he loves, and what he commands her to love,
for him, and in him, but not as him: if she does so, she becomes Adultera
Christo, as St. Cyprian speaks, and may not be admitted to sing in David's
quire, or at least not to bear a part in this Antheme, Whom have I in heaven
but thee, O Lord?

No more than the life of the body can be maintained without natural heat and
moisture, can the life of grace be preserved in the soul without continual
supply of the moisture of penitent tears, and a great measure of the heat of
divine love, wherewith we are to consume those spiritual sacrifices of prayer
and praises, which we are now and at all times to offer, lifting up pure hands
and hearts unto God. To kindle this sacred fire, I have brought you a live
coal from the Altar of incense, David's heart, sending up sweetest perfumes of
most fragrant and savourie meditations.

This coal the best Interpreters ancient and later, conspiring in their
expositions blow after this manner: St. Hier. in hunc locum. Neque in coelo
neque in terra alium praeter te quaesivi.
Jerome thus, I have sought none in heaven or earth beside thee. Calvin.
Praeter Deum nihil in coelo vel in terra appeto.
Calvin, I desire nothing in heaven or earth but thee. Cajetan. Te solum in
coelo and in terra volui.
Cajetan, Thee alone I affect in heaven and in earth. Marlor. Nihil tecum amo.
Marlorat, I love nothing with thee. And most effectually Mollerus. Te pro and
prae omnibus thesauris aestimo.
Mollerus, I esteem thee in stead of and above all treasures: as if he should
say in more words; Others lay up treasures upon earth, but heaven is my
treasury, and God is my riches; he is my lot, as I am his purchase; he is the
only supporter of my crown, and crown of my joy, and joy of my heart: upon
him I set my whole delight, in him I repose all my confidence, to him I
address all my petitions, from him I expect all my happiness: all my hope is
in his promises, all my comfort in his word, all my wealth in his bounty, all
my joy in the light of his countenance, all my contentment in his love: above
him, without him, besides him I love nothing; but all things in him and for
him. Lord let me live out of the world with thee, but let me not live in the
world without thee. For I make no reckoning of any thing in the world in
comparison of thee, nor of all the world without thee: take away all things
from me so thou give me thy self; for if thou take away thy self, thou
take away all things. O let me therefore quickly enjoy thee in heaven, for
even whilst I am upon earth my heaven is in thee. Here I cannot hold on my
Paraphrase, but must needs break off with that passionate exclamation of St.
Poelicissimam animam quae Deo sic a Deo meretur affici, ut per unitatem
spiritus in Deo nihil amet nisi Deum.
Bernard, O thrice happy soul which by God and his grace art so affected with
God and his love, that in God, in whom all things are to be had, thou desire
nothing but God himself.

By this bright blaze of the words you may easily discern the parts; which are
two, 1 A higher strain of notes ascending, Quis mihi, etc. 2 A lower of notes
descending, and tecum non optavi, etc.
Or if you like better to change the terms of music, which is the rhetoric of
sounds, into the terms of rhetoric, which is the music of words; this
sentence consists of 1 A passionate interrogation, Whom have I in, etc. 2 A
confident asseveration, And I desire none, etc.
In both I observe, 1 The convenience of the order, Whom have I in heaven, and
then, I desire, etc. 2 The propriety of the phrases have and desire; have in
heaven, desire on earth: nothing to be desired, but to be had in heaven;
nothing to be had, but to be desired on earth. 3 The variety of the
Prepositions praeter and cum, I have nothing but thee: I desire nothing with
thee, for the reason assigned by Paulin. in Bib. Patr. to. 5. p. 1. Omnium
conditor, cui nihil eorum quae fecit valet aequari, non dignatur cum his quae
condidit aequari.
Paulinus; God, who made none of his creatures in any degree equal to
himself, will have none made of like unto himself.
Whereupon it ensues, that there is fullness of delight and contentment in
God, and that there is no solid delight and contentment for the immortal soul
of man but in him; and consequently, that we are to set our heart, and settle
our love, and ground our repose, and repose our felicity wholly and solely in
him, with Aug. confess. l. 10. Cum quo solo, and de quo solo, and in quo solo
anima intellectualis vere beata est.
whom only, and in whom only, and through whom only the understanding soul
of man finds and everlastingly enjoys true blessedness. Of which use of
the doctrine, and doctrine of the notes, and notes of my Text, whilst I treat
briefly, I humbly entreat Almighty God to assist me with his Spirit, and you
to support me with your patience.

First, of the order. As God first created the heaven, and all the host
thereof, and after the earth and earthly creatures; so in our desires we ought
first to aim at heaven and heavenly objects, and after we have fixed our
thoughts, and settled our affections upon them, to have an eye to the earth,
and take order for the things of this life. God has placed the heaven above
the earth, and shall we by our inordinate desires set the earth above the
heaven, advancing things temporal above those that are eternal? this were to
overthrow the order of nature, and break the golden rule laid down by our
Savior, Mat. 6.33.
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these
things shall be ministered unto you. First, lift up your eyes and your hearts to
heaven, and say with David, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and then tell us
what or whom you desire, or desire not upon earth.

Have I in heaven, or desire on earth. The Translaters might have retained the
verb have in both members: but in regard of the deceivablenesse and
uncertainty of earthly goods and possessions, they change the verb have in the
first member into desire in the second, have in heaven and desire on earth, not
desire in heaven and have on earth: for in precise truth there is nothing which
a religious soul can desire, but she has it in heaven: and on the contrary,
nothing to be had that is firmly possessed and enjoyed, which she desires on
earth; Heaven is the place of having, the earth of desiring or craving. When an
old man being asked of his age, answered in the Latin phrase, Octoginta annos
habeo, that is, I have or reckon upon fourscore years: a Philosopher standing
by took him up, saying, Imo tot annos non habes, what say thou, I have or
reckon upon fourscore years? just so many years thou have not; for in
numbering the days and years of our life, whose parts are never all come till
they are all gone, we usually count upon those years only that are fully
past, which we therefore have not, because they are past and gone; even as he
that takes a lease for term of years, after he has worn them out, has no
more term in his lease, or estate in his living; no more may any man be said
to have those years good, which he has spent in the lease of his life. Much
less may he be said to have those that are to come, because they are not yet,
and he is altogether uncertain whether they are to come or no. For all that
he knows, this day the lease of his life may expire, this hour his last
glass may be running, at this very moment and point of time the thread of his
life may be cut off. Now if we cannot be said truly to have any part of our
time, how can we have any part in things temporal? if the lease of our lives,
by which we hold all our earthly goods and possessions, be of so uncertain a
date, let our common Lawyers talk never so much of possessions and estates,
and firm conveighances and perpetuities, and several kinds of tenures, they
shall never persuade me, that there is any sure hold or good tenure of any
thing save God and his promises: it is impossible that we should have any
estate in things that are altogether Cyp epist. l. 2. Nec fiduciam praebent
possidentibus stabilem, quae possessionis non habent veritatem.
unstable. Hereof it seems Abraham was well advised; for though he were an
exceeding rich man, yet we read of no purchase made by him, save only of a
Genesis 25.10.
cave in Machpelah, for him and his heirs to hold, or rather to hold him and
his heirs for ever. If any man ever knew the just value of all earthly
commodities, it was King Solomon, the mirror of wisdom, and yet he, after he
had weighed them all in the scales of the Sanctuary, found them as light as
vanity it self. Omnia sub sole vanitas; ergo supra solemn veritas, as rightly
infers Paulin. in opusc.
Paulinus: If all things under the sun are vanity; therefore the verity of
all things is above the sun, viz.

In heaven. Whom have I in heaven but thee? that is, thee I have, and none but
thee in heaven. I deny not that which Saint Tract. 50. in Johan. Habes Christum
in praesenti per signum, in praesenti per fidem, in praesenti per baptismatis
sacramentum.
Austine affirms in express terms, that we have God many ways with us in
this life; for we see him in his works, we hear him in his word, we taste him
in the Sacrament, we feel him by the motions of the Spirit within us, we touch
him by faith, we embrace him by love, we rely upon him by hope, we have
private conference with him by prayer: yet all this is nothing to our modus
habendi, our manner of having him in heaven. Then a man may be truly said to
have a lordship, manor, benefice, or living, when he enters upon the fruits
thereof, and receives the crop. The Lord is indeed our lot and portion even in
this life; but we cannot reap the thousanth part of the profits and delights he
has in himself, and will afford us hereafter. They to whom he most imparteth
himself, and communicates his goodness here, have but a taste only of the
tree of life, a weak sent of the flowers of Paradise, a confused noise of
heavenly music as it were afar off, no more than a glympse of the sun of
righteousness, but a blast of the Spirit only, an earnest-penny of their
wages; yet such a taste as more satisfies them than a royal banquet furnished
with all the delicacies the sea or land can yield: such a sent as they will not
leave for all the sweet odours of Arabia: such a noise as they would not miss
the hearing thereof, for all the consorts in the world: such a glympse, as is
to be preferred before the full view of all the Kingdoms of the earth, and the
glory of them: such a blast, as more refreshes the soul, than a constant gale
of prosperous fortune: such an earnest-penny, as they would not lose for the
treasures of Solomon. This taste, this sent, this glympse, this blast, this
earnest-penny, the Kingly Prophet David so exceedingly desired, that he
compares the ardency of his affection to the thirst of a Heart, either long
chased, or after he is stung with the serpent Dipsas, that sets all his throat
on fire. As the Psalm. 42.1, 2.
Heart brayeth and pants in this case for the rivers of waters to cool his
heat, and quench his thirst, so pants my soul after thee, O God. My soul
thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before
God? Of this thirst of the soul they only can speak feelingly, who have been
long Cant 2.5 Stay me with slagons, and comfort me with apples: for I am
sick with love.
sick with the Spouse in the Canticles, who feeling her heart faint, and all
her vital faculties fail, cries out, Stay me, etc. that is, hold life in
me with cordial waters and sovereign smells; for I languish, I swoune, my
soul is running out of the doors of my lips after him, whom she incomparably
loves above all things in heaven and in earth; yet she sees here nothing but
his back parts, that is, obscure shadows and resemblances of him. And if she
be so enamoured with these, how will she be ravished at the sight of his
countenance? if she take such contentment in the contemplation of his image in
a mirror, how will she be transported, when she shall see him face to face,
and be united to him spirit to spirit? if she take such pleasure in pledging
him in the bitter cup of his passion, what will she take in Psalm. 16.11.
drinking of the rivers of pleasures, that run at his right hand for evermore?
To borrow a strain of the Schools, for the closing up of this sweet note, Hic
Deum amamus amore desiderii, at in coelo amore amicitiae, Here we love God with
a love of desire, there with a love of friendship; here we desire to have God,
there we have our full desire: and so I fall into the maine doctrine of the
Text, That there is fullness of delight and content in God. Quid eo avarius
est, cui Deus non sufficit, in quo sunt omnia? Can we desire larger possessions
than immensity? a surer estate than immutability? a longer term of years than
eternity? Let Saint De vita contemplat. l. 2. c. 15. Quid potest eo esse
foelicius, cujus efficitur suus conditor census, and haereditas ejus dignatur
esse ipsa divinitas? si modo sanctis operibus eum colat, omnes fructus ex illo
percipiet.
Prosper speak, Who so fortunate, as he whose Maker is his fortune? who so
rich, as he who possesses him that possesses all things, whose lord is his
lot, and his owner part of his goods? Howbeit, because we cannot perfectly
survey, much less take full possession of this our large or rather infinite
inheritance, in this life, Mollerus conceives these words not to be uttered in
an exultation of spirit, ravished with the contemplation of God; but rather as
a prayer to this effect: O that I had thee in heaven; as when the Prophet
demands, Who will show us any good? we take the meaning to be, O that any
would show us some good: and in like manner, in the second of Samuel, Who 2 Samuel
23.15.
will bring me water out of the fountain? that is, O that some would give me
a draught of it. Notwithstanding I see no reason why we should vary from the
most general interpretation of these words, which is, that they contain a
protestation, not a prayer, and carry this sense: O Lord, I am so ravished with
thy beauty, and satisfied with thy love, that I desire nothing like unto thee,
nay, nothing but for thee, nay, nothing but thee. With which exposition that
strain of Paulinus perfectly accords, though set in a more doleful key,
when the barbarous and savage Goths had invaded the City of Nola, ransacked his
house, rifled his coffers, and took away all that he had; he yielded not to
the stream of sorrow, which might have carried him into the gulf of despair,
but striving against it, he lifts up his hands and head above water, praying
to God after this manner: Aug. de civ. Dei l. 1. c. 10. Domine, ne excrucier
propter aurum and argentum; ubi enim sunt omnia mea tu seis: ibi enim habebat
omnia sua, ubi eum thesau^r^are ille monuerat, qui haec mala ventura
praedixerat.
Lord, let not the loss of these things vex me, or disquiet my soul: for
thou know where I have laid up all my treasures, to wit, in thee: for, whom
have I in heaven

But thee? These words are not expressed in the original, yet by comparing
this with the latter clause, And in earth I desire nothing with thee, are
necessarily added to supply the sense.

Yea, but you will say, how might David truly demand, Whom have I in heaven but
thee? Is there none to be had in heaven but God? are there none that walk in
the streets of the celestial Jerusalem paved with gold? do none dwell in those
glorious tabernacles that are not made with hands? do those twelve precious
gates serve only to beautify the holy City? do none enter in at them?
surely, if these dark and low rooms are so well filled, it is not like those
large, fair, and lightsome upper rooms are void? the sky is not more richly
decked with glistering stars, than the throne of God with celestial lights:
out of question there are innumerable regiments, bands, and royal armies of
Cherubins and Seraphins, Archangels and Angels, Saints and Martyrs; yet the
faithful soul has none of these, or rather none of these has her, but he
whom they all serve, who has vouchsafed to make her his Spouse, and marry her
to himself in righteousness: in none but him she has affiance, to none but him
she addresseth her prayers, for none but him she keeps her heart; him she
serves as her lord, obeys as her king, honors as her father, and loves
as her husband; and in this respect may truly say, Whom have I in heaven but
thee? When Xenophon. Cyr. poed. l. 3.
Cyrus took the king of Armenia and his son Tigranes, and their wives and
children prisoners, and upon their humble submission, beyond all hope, gave
them their liberty and their lives; in their return home, as they all fell on
commending Cyrus, some for his personage, some for his puissance, some for his
clemency; Tigranes asked his wife, What think thou of Cyrus? is he not a
comely and a proper man, of a majesticall presence? Truly, says she, I know
not what manner of man he is, I never looked on him. Why (quoth he) where were
thine eyes all the while? upon whom did thou then look? I fixed mine eyes
(says she) all the while upon him (meaning her husband) who in my hearing
offered to Cyrus to lay down his life for my ransom: In like manner, if any
question the devout soul, whether she be not enamoured with the beauty of
Cherubins and Seraphins, Angels or Saints: her answer will be the same with
that of Tigranes his wife, that she never cast a look on them, because her eyes
were never off him, who not only offered to lay, but laid down his life for
her, and ransomed her with his own blood. Whom should she have in heaven but
him, who has none on earth but her? Intus apparens prohibet Mercenarius in
phys.
extraneum, the vessel that is full of balsamum excludes all other oils or
liquors: the soul that is full of God, and full with God, excludes the love
of all creatures, and accounts them as nothing in comparison, as we may see
in S. Paul, Phil. 3.7, 8.
What things were gain to me, those I account loss for Christ, yea,
doubtless I account all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge
of Jesus Christ. And in holy Ignatius the Hieron. catal. viror. illust. Ignis,
crux, bestiae, confractio ostium, membrorum divisio, and totius corporis
contritio, and tota tormenta Diaboli in me veniant, tantum ut Christo fruar.
ancient Bishop of Antioch, who when he was ready to be stripped and thrown naked
to the Lions, brake out into this passionate speech, Take away all from me,
and come what can come upon me, fire, cross, beasts tearing my flesh, parting
of my members, breaking of my bones, and contrition of my whole body, and all
the torments that man or devil can devise, only that I may enjoy Christ. That
which Origin delivers concerning the nature of Manna, that it answered to
every man's several taste, we have good warrant of Scripture to affirm of God,
who satisfies with infinite delicacies all their appetites who long for him.
Do they thirst for grace? he is so full of grace, that of his John 1.16.
fullness we all receive. For glory? he is the Psalm. 24.10.
King of glory. For wisdom? in him are all the treasures of wisdom and
Colos. 2.3.
knowledge hid. For peace? he is the Esaias 9.6.
Prince of peace. For beauty? he is Psalm. 36.9.
fairer than the sons of men; grace is powered into his lips. For life? with him
is the Psalm. 45.2.
Well of life, and in his light shall we see light. For joy and pleasures? in
his presence Psalm. 16.11.
is fullness of joy, and at his right hand there are pleasures for evermore,
wherewith he quenches all the thirsty appetites of the soul. Philosophy
teaches, that the understanding naturally thirsts for truth; the will for
that which the understanding apprehends to be good, the affections for glory
and felicity, the senses for pleasure, the eye for beauty, the ear for
harmony, the smell for sweet odours, the taste for delicious meats, the touch
for amorous embracings: all these thirsts God does satisfy and quench after
this manner, viz. the thirst of the understanding with his wisdom, of the will
with his goodness, of the affections with his glory and blessedness, of the
senses with his nature, which contains in it the quintessence and perfection
of all delectable objects. For as God is in all things, so all things are in
him after a more excellent manner than they are in themselves: in themselves
they never were without imperfection, nor are since the fall of Adam without
impurity and corruption; but in him they are perfect without defect, pure
without pollution, permanent and stable without any shadow of change; in regard
of which their eminent manner of subsistence in him, they change their names
and appellations: and as that which in earthly bodies is matter, the
Philosophers call form, or Zab. Phys. lib. de coel.
materia formalis in heaven, and parts degrees, and beauty light or clarity,
and qualities influences; so that which is accident in the creature, is
substance in the Creator: and that which is called beauty in us, is majesty in
him; life is immortality, strength omnipotency, wealth all sufficiency, delight
felicity, affection virtue, virtue nature, nature all things: For Romans 11.36.
of him, and through him, and in him are all things, as the grand master of
Philosophy discerned by the glimmering light of reason, saying, that it is
manifest, that the Deity is in all things, Arist. mor. ad Eud. (...).
and all things in it: in him the understanding apprehends all truth, the
will all good, the affections all virtue and glory, the senses all pleasure,
the desires all contentments; and therefore it follows,

And I desire nothing in the earth with thee. The heart resembles a perfect
triangle, but the figure of the world is circular, and no more can it satisfy
the heart of man, than a circle can fill a triangle. God only, who is a
trinity in unity, can fill all the corners of this triangle of his own making.
For nothing can delight the spiritual nature of the soul, but a pure spirit:
nothing can content the sovereign faculty of the understanding, but a
sovereign object: nothing can satisfy the infinite desires of the will, but
infinitum bonum; which must be infinite four ways:

1. In power, to remove all things that may be offensive or hurtful to us.

2. In bounty, to supply all those good things that may be delightful or
useful to us.

3. In essence, to furnish us with infinite variety of delights.

4. In continuance, to perpetuate unto us the infinite variety of continual
delights and contentments.

Now, what is there in heaven or in earth thus spiritual in substance,
sovereign in place, infinite in power, goodness and essence, everlasting in
continuance, but thou, O Lord, whom, because we have in heaven, we desire
nothing on earth? What should we desire there, where we find nothing to fix
our thoughts, or afford us any solid comfort or contentment? Who can aim
steadily at a moving mark? or build firmly upon sinking sand? or hold fast a
vanishing shadow? or rest himself upon the wings of the wind? as impossible is
it to lay any sure ground of contentment, or foundation of happiness in the
unstable vanities and uncertain comforts of this life. How can they fulfill
our desires, or satisfy our appetites, which are not only empty, but
emptiness it self? How can they establish our hearts, since they are
altogether unstable themselves? How can they yield us any true delight or
contentment, which have no verity in them, but are shadows and painted shows,
like the carved dishes Caligula set before his flatterers; or the grapes drawn
by Zeuxis, wherewith he deceived the birds? The best of them are no better than
the apples of Sodom, of which Pliny and Solinus write, that they are apples
whilst you behold them, but ashes when you touch them: or like the herb Sardoa
in Sardinia, upon which if a man feed, it so works upon his spleen, that he
never leaves laughing, till he dies through immoderate mirth. Honors,
riches, pleasures are but glorious titles written in golden characters; under
them we find nothing but vanity: under the title of nobility nothing but a brag
of our parents virtue, and that is vanity; under honor nothing but the opinion
of other men, and this can be but vanity; under glory but breath and wind, and
this is certainly vanity; under pleasure but Eras. Apoph. Demos. Non emam tanti
poenitere.
repentance and folly, and is not this vanity? under sumptuous buildings, rich
hangings, and gorgeous apparel, but ostentation of wealth and outward pomp,
and this is vanity of vanity. Nobility in the original of it is but the infamy
of Adam: (for it knew not Hevah till after his fall and grievous prevarication)
beauty the daughter of corruption, apparel the cover of shame, gold and
silver the dregs of the earth, oils and costly ointments the sweat of trees,
silks and velvets the excrements of worms; and shall our immortal spirit,
nobly descended from the sacred Trinity, match so low with this nether world,
and take these toys and trifles for a competent dowry?

And let this suffice to be spoken to the words for their full explication; let
us now hear what they speak to us for our further use and instruction. 1.
They speak to our faith, that it be resolved upon God only. 2. To our
devotion, that it be directed to God only. 3. To our love, that it be entirely
fixed on God only. 1. True faith says, Whom have I in heaven but thee to rely
upon? 2. True religion says, Whom have I but thee to call upon? 3. True love
says, Whom have I but thee to settle upon?



No Papist can bear a part with David in this song, saying, Whom have I in
heaven but thee, O Lord? for they have many in heaven, to whom they address
their prayers in general, and often solicit them upon special occasions: as
for rain, for fair weather, in a common plague, in danger of childbirth, in
perils by sea, in perils by land, for their own health and recovery, and for
the safety of their beasts and cattle; as appears by the forms of prayers yet
extant in their Liturgies, Offices, Manuels, and Service books. Doubtless
these monopolies were not granted to Saints in David's time; for he had recourse
everywhere to God immediately for any thing he stood in need of: neither had
the ancient Fathers any knowledge of so many new masters of requests in heaven,
to prefer their petitions to God: for they addressed themselves all to one
Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who sits at the right
hand of his Father, to take all our petitions, and to recommend them unto him.
I can make no other construction of the words of Lib. 8. cont. Cel. (...).
Origin, We must religiously worship or invocate none but God and his only
begotten Son. We must call upon none but God, says Hieron. in Prove. l. 1. c 2.
Neminem invocare nisi Deum debemus.
Jerome. Tertul. apol. c. 30. Quaecunque hominis and Caesaris vota sunt, haec
ab alio orare non possum, quam a quo scio me consecuturum, quoniam and ipse est
qui solus praestat, and ego familus ejus qui eum solum invoco.
Tertullian goes farther on our way, We can pray to none other but God:
whatsoever is to be wished for Caesar, as he is a man or a Prince, I cannot
beg it of any other than of him from whom I know I shall receive what I ask,
because he alone can perform it, and I his servant depend upon none but him.
But what stand I upon the testimonies of two or three Fathers? the whole Synod
of Theod. com. in 2. ad Colos. Synodus Laodicea lege prohibuit, ne praecarentur
Angelos, ubi agit de oratoriis Michaelis, and eos perstringit qui dicebant
oportere per Angelos divinam sibi benevolentiam conciliare.
Laodicea condemns the superstitious error of some, who taught, that we
ought to use Angels as mediators between God and us, and to pray unto them.
And for Saints, who have no more commission to solicit our business in heaven
than Angels, howsoever it pleased the ancient Church to make honorable mention
of them in their public Service, as we do of the blessed Virgin, the
Archangel, the Apostles and Evangelists; yet S. Aug. l. 22. de civit. Dei c.
10. Martyrs suo loco and ordine nominantur, non tamen a Sacerdote qui
sacrificat, invocantur.
Austin clears the Christians of those times from any kind of invocation: The
Martyrs, says he, in their place and rank are named, yet not called upon by
the Priest, who offers the sacrifice. Invocation is the highest branch of
divine worship, and they who bow down to, and call upon Saints, consequently
put Saints in Gods room; and believe in them: Quomodo enim invocabunt, in quos
non credunt? How Romans 10.14.
shall they call on them, on whom they have not believed? They who call upon
Saints deceased, and hope for any benefit by such prayers, must be persuaded
that the Saints are present in all places, to hear their prayers, and receive
their petitions, and that they understand particularly all their affairs, and
are privy to the very secrets of their hearts; and is not this to make gods of
Saints? Mart. epigr.
Qui fingit sacros auro vel marmore vultus,
non facit ille deos: qui rogat ille facit.
Yea, but say our Romish adversaries, had you a suit to the King, you would
make a friend at Court, and employ some in favor with his Majesty to solicit
your affairs; why take ye not the like course in your business of greater
importance in the Court of Heaven? We answer:

First, because God himself checketh such carnal imaginations, and
overthrows the ground of all such arguments by his holy Prophet, saying, Esaias
55.8.
My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways. Therefore
we are brought to the presence of kings (says S. Amb. in ep. ad Romans c. 1.
Itur ad reges per tribunos, and comites, quia homo utique rex est, ad Deum quem
nihil latet promerendum suffragatore non est opus, sed mente devota.
Ambrose) by lords and officers, because the king is a man; and all cannot have
immediate access unto him, neither will he take it well, that all sorts of
people at all times should press upon him: but it is not so with God: he
calls all Mat. 11.28. Come unto me all that labor, etc.
unto him, calls upon all to Psalm. 50.15. Call upon me in the day of trouble,
and I will hear, etc.
call upon him, and promises help and Joel 2.32. Whosoever shall call upon the
Name, etc.
salvation to all that shall so do: neither need we any spokes-man (says he)
to him, save a devout and religious mind.

Secondly, admit the proportion to hold between the King of Heaven and earthly
Princes, yet the reason holds not: for if the King appoint a certain officer
to take all supplications, and exhibit all petitions unto him, he will not
take it well, if we use any other; but so it is in our present case, God has
appointed us a John 14 3. Whatsoever ye shall ask in my Name, that will I do.
Ver. 6. I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the Father but

incercession, who is not only Hebr. 7.25. Wherefore he is able to save them to
the uttermost, that com^ unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make

able, but most willing to prefer all our suits, and procure a gracious
answer for us: for we have not an high Priest, which cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sin: let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. We know not whether
Saints hear us, or rather we know they hear us not: Esaias 63.16. Abraham is
ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledges us not. If they hear us, we know not
whether God will hear them for us; but we know that our Savior hears us,
and that God always hears him when he prays for us: John 11.42. I know
that thou hear me always.

Yet our Saint-invocators have one refuge to fly unto, and they hold it a very
safe one: We call upon the living, say they, to pray for us; why may we not be
so far indebted to the Saints departed, who the further they are from us, the
nearer they are to God? If it be no wrong to Christ's intercession to desire the
prayers of our friends in this life, neither can it be any derogation to his
Mediatourship to call upon Saints deceased Of this argument Bellar de sanct.
beatit. l. 1. c. 19.
Bellarmine as much braggeth, as Peleus of his sword, Profecto istud argumentum
haeretici nunquam solvere potuerunt, the heretics, says he, were never able
to untie this argument. I believe him, because there is no knot at all in it.
For,

First, we do not properly invocate any man living, (...), we call to them to
assist us with their prayers, we call not upon them, as putting any confidence
in them. When at parting we usually commend our selves to our friends, and
desire them to commend us to God in their prayers, we require of them a duty of
Christian charity; we do them therein no honor, much less perform any
religious service to them, as the Church of Rome does to Saints deceased.

Secondly, when we pray them to pray for us, we make this request to them, as
co-adjutors, to join with us in the duty of prayer, not as mediators, to use
their favor with God, or plead their merits, as Papists do in their Letanies,
adjuring God (as it were) by the faith of Confessors, and constancy of Martyrs,
and chastity of virgins, and abstinence of monks, and merits of all Saints.

Thirdly, God commands the living to have a fellow-feeling of one another
miseries, and to 2 Cor, 1.11. Phil. 1.4. C^l^s 4.3. 2 These. 3.1. Heb. 13.18.
James 5.16.
pray one for another; but he no where lays such an injunction upon the dead
to pray for us, or upon us to pray to them:

Fourthly, we have many presidents in Scripture of the faithful, who have
earnestly besought their brethren to remember them in their Phil. 1.19. Gal.
4.3. 2 These. 3.1. Philem. 22. Heb. 13.18.
prayers; but among all the songs of Moses, psalms of David, complaints of
Jeremy, and prayers of Prophets and Apostles, you shall not find any one
directed to any Saint departed; from the first of Genesis to the last Verse of
the Apocalypse, there is no precept for the invocation of Saints, no example of
it, no promise unto it.

Fifthly and lastly, we entreat not any man living to pray for us, but either
by word of mouth when he is present with us, or by some friend, who we know
will acquaint him with our desire, or by letters, when we have sure means to
conveigh them to him, whereby he may understand how the case stands with us,
and what that is in particular for which we desire his prayers. All which
reasons fail in the invocation of Saints deceased: for we have no messengers
to send to them, nor means to conveigh letters to the place where they are,
neither are they within hearing, neither can we be any way assured that they
either know our necessities, or are privy to the secrets of our heart. For the
Mathematical glass, which some of the Schoolmen have set in heaven, wherein
(they say) the Saints in heaven see all things done upon earth, to wit, in God,
who sees all things; it has bin long since beat into pieces: for I demand, Is
this essence of God a necessary glass, or a voluntary? that is, Do they see
all things in it, or such things only as it pleases him to present to their
view? if they see all things, their knowledge must needs be infinite as Gods
is, they must needs comprehend in it all things past, present and future; yea,
the thoughts of the heart, which God peculiarly Apoc. 2.23. I am he that
searches the heart and reins.
assumeth to himself: yea, the day of Judgment, which our Savior assures us
no man knows, not the Mat. 24.36
Angels in heaven, nor the son of Mar. 13.32 But of that day and hour knows
no man, no not the Angels that are in heaven neither the Son, but the Father.
man, as man. If they see only such things as God is pleased to reveal unto
them, how may he that prays unto them be assured, that God will reveal unto
them either his wants in particular, or his prayers? how can he pray unto them
in faith, who has no word of faith, whereby he may be assured either that God
reveals his prayers to them, or that God will accept their prayers for him?
Certainly, there was no such crystal instrument as Papists dream of, to
discover unto Saints departed the whole earth, and all things that are in it in
the time of Abraham, Isaac, or Josiah: for St. Austin in his book de Cap. 13.
Si parents non intersunt, qui sunt alii mortuorum, qui noverunt quid agamus,
quid ve patiamur, and ibi sunt spiritus defunctorum ubi non vidunt quaecunque
aguntur, aut even^unt in ista vita hominibus.
cura pro mortuis, out of the second book of Kings, and the 63. of Esaias
concludes, that since kings see not the evils which befall their people after
their death; and since parents are ignorant of their children, without doubt the
Saints departed have no intelligence how things pass after their death here
upon earth. So far is it from being a branch of their happiness, to know the
passages of human affairs here, that S. Jerome. in epitaph. Nepot Foelix Nepo
ianus qui haec non audit, non videt.
Jerome makes it a part of their happiness, that they are altogether ignorant of
them: happy Nepotian, who neither hears nor sees any of those things, which
would vex his righteous soul, and do cause us who see and hear them, often to
water our plants.

By this which has bin said, any whose judgments are not fore-stalled, may
perceive the impiety of that part of Romish piety which concerns invocation
of Saints; it is not only needless and fruitless, but also superstitious, and
most sacrilegious: for it robs God of a special part of his honor, and
wrongeth Christ in his office of mediator. When he holds out his golden
scepter unto us, and calls to us, saying, Come unto me, come by me, I am the
way, shall we run to any other to bring us to him? shall we seek a way to the
way? shall we use mediators to our mediator? this were to lay a like
imputation upon our Redeemer, to that which S. De civit. Dei l. 1. Interpres
deorum eget interpret, and sors ipsa referenda est ad sorts.
Austin casts upon the heathen Apollo, the interpreter of the gods needs an
interpreter, and we are to cast lots upon the lot it self. Let it not seem
burdensome unto you, my dear brethren, that I speak much in behalf of him,
who alone speaks in behalf of us all: we cannot do our Redeemer a worser
affront, we cannot offer our mediator a greater wrong, than to go from him
whom God has appointed our perpetual advocate and intercessor, and employ
Saints in our suites to God, as if they were in greater grace with the Father,
or they were better affected to us than he. Have we the like experience of
their love as we have of his? did they pawn their lives for us? have they
ransomed us with their blood? will he refuse us, who gave us himself? will he
not power out hearty prayers for us, who powered out his heart blood for us?
will he spare breath in our cause, who breathed out his soul for us? shall we
forsake the fountain of living water, and draw out of broken cisternes that can
hold no water? shall we run from the source to the conduit for the water of
life? from the sun to the beam for light of knowledge? from the head to the
members for the life of grace? from the king to the vassal for a crown of
glory?

But I made choice of this Scripture rather to stir up your devotion, than to
beat down Popish superstition; therefore I leave arguments of confutation, and
set to motives of persuasion. Look how the Opal presents to the eye the
beautiful colors of almost all precious stones; so the graces, virtues, and
perfections of all natures shine in the face of God to draw our love to him:
among which, two most kindle our affection, virtue and beauty; nothing so
lovely as virtue, which is the beauty of the mind: and beauty, which is the
chief grace and virtue of the body. To give virtue her due, which is the first
place, we speak not so properly, when we say that God has any virtue, as when
we attribute to him all virtue in the abstract, all wisdom, all justice, all
holiness, all goodness. Goodness is the rule of our will, but Gods will is the
rule of goodness it self: we are to do things because they are just and good;
but contrariwise things are just and good because God does them; therefore if
virtue be the lodestone of our love, it will first draw it to God, whose nature
is the perfection of all virtue. As for beauty, what is it but proportion and
color? the beauty of color it self is light, and light is but a shadow or
obscure delineation of God, whose face darkneth the sun, and dazleth the eyes
of the Cherubins, who to save them, hold their wings before them like a plume
of feathers. A glympse whereof when the Prophet David saw, he was so ravished
with it, that as if there were nothing else worthy the seeing, and it were
impossible to have enough of so admirable an object, he cries out, Psa. 105.4.
seek his face evermore; not so much for the delight he took in beholding it,
as for the light he received from it. For beholding the glory of God as in a
mirror with open face, we are changed into his image, and after a sort made
partakers of the divine nature. o my soul, says a Saint of God, mark what thou
love; for thou becommest like to that which thou likest, Si coelum diligis,
coelum es, si terram diligis, terra es, audeo dicere, si Deum diligis, Deus es;
if thou sincerely and perfectly love heavenly objects, thou becomest
heavenly, if carnal, thou becomest sensual, if spiritual, thou becomest
ghostly, if God, thou becomest divine. Let us stay a while, and consider what a
wonderful change is wrought in the soul of man by the power of divine love;
surely though a deformed Black-a-moor look his eyes out upon the fairest beauty
the world can present, he gets no beauty by it, but seems the more ougly by
standing in sight of so beautiful a creature: the sun burns them black, and
darkeneth their sight, who long gaze upon his beams; but contrarily, the Sun of
righteousness the more we look upon him, the more he enlighteneth the eyes,
Poulin. in opusc. Illum amemus quem amare debitum, quem amplecti chastitas, cui
nubere virginitas, etc.
and makes them fair, and their faces shine who behold him, as Moses his did,
after he came down from the Mount where he had parley with God. O then let us
love to behold him, the sight of whose countenance will make us fair and lovely
to behold: let us conform our selves to him, who will transform us into himself:
let us reflect the beams of our affection upon the father of lights: let us
knit our hearts to him, whom freely to love is our bounden duty, to embrace is
chastity, to marry is virginity, to serve is liberty, to desire is contentment,
to imitate is perfection, to enjoy is everlasting happiness. To whom, etc.

THE ROYAL PRIEST. A Sermon preached in Saint Mary's Church in Oxford; Anno
1613. THE XXXVII. SERMON.
PSALM. 110.4. The Lord swear, and will not repent, thou art a Priest for ever
after the order of Melchisedech.


Right Worshipful, etc.
THere are three principal attributes of God, Wisdom, Goodness, Power.
Wisdom to comprehend all the good that can be, Goodness to will all that
which in wisdom he comprehends, Power to effect all that in goodness he
wills and decrees for the manifestation of his justice and mercy to his
creatures.

These three attributes of God shine most clearly in the three offices of
Christ, 1 Kingly. 2 Priestly. 3 Prophetical.
Power in his Kingly, Wisdom in his Prophetical, Goodness in his Priestly
function. For Christ by his Princely authority declares especially the power,
by his Prophetical he reveals the wisdom, and by his Priesthood he
manifests the goodness of God to all mankind. Christ as a Prophet in
wisdom teaches us what in his goodness he has merited for us as a Priest,
and by his power he will bestow upon us as a King, freedom from all misery in
the Kingdom of glory. And on these three offices of Christ the three divine
graces 1 Faith, 2 Hope, 3 Charity,
have a kind of dependence: 1 Faith holds on him as a Prophet. 2 Hope as a
King. 3 Charity as a Priest.
For Faith builds upon the truth of his Prophecy, Hope relieth upon the
power of his Kingdom, Charity embraces the functions of his Priesthood,
whereby he washes us from our sins in his own blood, and makes us Apoc.
1.5, 6.
Kings and Priests unto God and his Father.

In this Psalm David, as Christ's Herald, proclaims these his titles: First,
his Kingly; Sit thou on my right hand, ver. 1. Be thou ruler in the midst of
thine enemies, ver. 2. Secondly, his Prophetical; The people shall come
willingly in the beauty of holiness, ver. 3. Thirdly, his Priestly; The Lord
swear, thou art a Priest, ver. 4. To obscure which most clear and evident
interpretation of this Prophetical Psalm, although some mists of doubts have
been cast in former times; yet now after the Sun of righteousness is risen,
and has dispelled them by his own beams, nothing without impiety can be
opposed to it: for Mat. 22.42, 43, 44.
there he whom David means, opens David's meaning; he whom this Prophecy
discovers, discovers this Prophecy; he to whom this Scripture points,
points to this Scripture, and interpreting it of the Son of man, shows most
evidently that he is the King who reigns so victoriously, ver. 1. the Prophet
that preaches so effectually, ver. 3. and the Priest that abides continually,
according to the words of my text; which offer to our religious thoughts three
points of special observation: 1 The ceremony used at the consecration of our
Lord, The Lord swear. 2 The office conferred upon him by this rite or
ceremony, Thou art a Priest. 3 The prerogatives of this his office; which is
here declared to be 1 Perpetual, for ever, 2 Regular, after the order, 3
Royal, of Melchizedek.



First, the form and manner of our Saviors investiture or consecration was
most honorable and glorious, God the Father performing the rites; which were
not imposition of hands, and breathing on him the holy Ghost, but a solemn
deposition of his Father, with a protestation, Thou art a Priest: ceremonies
never used by any but God, nor in the investiture of any but Christ, nor his
investiture into any office but his Priesthood. Plin. panegyr. Trasan. Imperium
super Imperatorem Imperatoris voce delatum est, and nihil magis subjecti animo
factum est, quam quod caepit imperare.
At his coronation we hear nothing, but the Lord said, Sit thou on my right
hand. The rule of the whole world is imposed upon our Savior by command; and
even in this did Christ show his obedience to his Father, that he took upon
him the government of his Church. But at the consecration of Christ we have a
great deal more of ceremony and solemnity, God his Father takes an oath, and
particularly expresses the nature and condition of his office, a priesthood
after the order of Melchizedek: and he confirms it unto him for ever, saying,
Thou art a Priest for ever. Of all which circumstances the Apostle in the
Epistle to the c. 7.20, 21.
Hebrews takes special notice, and makes singular use to advance the
Priesthood of Christ above that of Aaron: Inasmuch as Christ was made a Priest,
not without an oath, by so much he was made a surety of a better Testament. For
those Priests were made without an oath, but he with an oath, by him that said
unto him,

The Lord, etc. Jehovah is the proper and essential name of God, never in the
Scriptures attributed to any creature, as most of the learned Rabbis and
Christian Interpreters observe: a name in such sort adored by the Jews, that,
in a superstitious reverence unto it, wheresoever they meet with it in the
text, they either over-skip it, or in place thereof read Adonai, or Lord: a
name also so much admired by the Gentiles, that they called their chief God
Jove, which is but a contraction of the Hebrew Jehovah. And as they glanced at
the very name, so they had a glympse of the reason thereof, as may appear by
Plutarch his exposition of the word (...), or, Thou art, engraven in golden
characters upon the gate of the Temple of Apollo, whereby (says he) they who
came to worship God, acknowledged that Being properly belonged to him. Him
whom St. John calls (...) Parmenides and Melissus term (...), I am (says
God to Exodus 3.14.
Moses) has sent thee: and again, I am that I am. Of all things else we may
say truly that they are not that they are, because they are not of themselves,
nor are their own essence, nor continue what they are. God properly is that he
is, because himself is his own being, and because he is that he was, and was
that he is, aad shall be what he was, and is, the same, yesterday, and to day,
and for ever.

Besides this reason of the name (...), derived from (...), God himself
intimates another, taken from his faithfulness and truth in performing his
promises: I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of
God all-sufficient: but by my name Exodus 6.3.
Jehovah was I not known unto them; that is, I had not made good my promise
unto them, I had not given being to my words; that is, I had not performed and
accomplished them. According to which etymology of the word Jehovah, the first
strain of this verse sounds to this tune; Jehovah swear, that is, he that
gives continuance to all things by his word, he gives his word for the
continuance of this thy sacred office: he who is always as good as his word,
nay, who is his word, has said, nay, has sworn, Thou art a Priest for ever.
The Lord

Swear. As we honor God in swearing by him, so the Father honors the Son
in swearing to him, or taking a solemn oath at his investiture. An oath is a
sacred form of speech, in which, for the confirmation of a truth, or assurance
of faith, supreme majesty is called upon as a witness or surety: this, if it
be done by any creature whomsoever, implies a kind of adoration of him by
whom they swear; who by this manner of appealing to him, is tacitly
acknowledged to be the Discerner of our thoughts, and supreme Judge of all our
actions: and therefore Aquinas defines juramentum, adorationis speciem, a kind
of adoration. But if supreme Majesty himself vouchsafe to use the like form,
he does not thereby adore himself, but most surely binds himself to the
performance of that, for which he pawneth as it were his glory and life. Thus
St. Austine briefly resolves the point; Quid est Dei juramentum? promissionis
firmamentum: si tu jurando testaris Deum, cur non Deus jurando testetur
semetiplum? L. 16. de Civit. Dei c 32. Quid est Dei ve^i veracisque juratio,
nisi promissi confirmatio, and infidelium quaedam increpatio?
What is Gods oath? (says he) a solemn kind of attestation to his promise
for our greater assurance.

As for the manner and form of this oath, though it be not here set down, yet
it may be easily gathered out of other texts of Scripture. For God always
swears either by his essence, or by his attributes; by his essence, Ezekiel.
18.3.
As I live, says the Lord; or by his attributes, either of power, as Esaias
62.8. He has sworn by his strong arm; or by his holiness, Psalm. 22.16.
Psalm. 89.35 or the like. Whence we may take up this observation by the way,
That Gods attributes are his essence, and his essence himself. For since God
cannot acknowledge any greater unless he should deny himself, it follows,
that he cannot swear by any thing that is not himself. If Princes have this
privilege, to confirm all their Proclamations and Patents with Test meipso,
Witness our selves, shall we require farther security from God? Not to believe
him upon his word, which is all that heaven and earth have to show for their
continuance, were incredulous impiety: to expect or demand further an oath of
him by whom we all swear, were presumptuous insolency. Yet see how the
goodness of God overcommeth the distrustfulnesse of man; he gives us more
security than we could have had the face to ask, or hope to obtain; he
vouchsafes not only a bill of his hand, his written word, but also enters
into bands for the performance of all covenants and grants made to us in the
name of our elder brother Christ Jesus. As often as I endeavor to stay my
thoughts upon this point, they break out into that exclamation of Tertul. l.
de peniten c. 4. O beatos nos quorum causa Deus jurat; O miserrimos, si nec
juranti Domino credimus.
Tertullian, O thrice happy we, for whose sake God takes an oath; but most
wretched we, if we believe not God, no not upon his oath. Or the like of Pliny
upon occasion of the Emperors deposing before the Consul, O strange thing, and
before this time unheard of, he swears by whom we all swear, he confirms
the Priesthood of his son by an oath, by whom all oaths are confirmed. In
which consideration I marvel not that Martin Luther was wont to say, he
tasted more sweetness, and received greater comfort in his meditation upon
this parcel of Scripture than any other. For what doctrine does the whole
Scripture afford so comfortable to a drooping conscience, charged with many
foul and grievous sins, as this, that God has sworn his only begotten
Son a Priest for ever, to sanctify our persons, and purge our sins, and
tender all our petitions to his Father? What sin so heinous, what abomination
so grievous, for which such a Priest cannot satisfy by the oblation of
himself? What cause so desperate, in which such an Advocate, if he plead, will
not prevail? What suit so difficult, which such a Mediator will not carry? We
may be sure God will not be hard to be entreated of us, who himself has
appointed us such an Intercessour, to whom he can deny nothing. Therefore
surely if there be any Balm in Gilead, it may be found on, or gathered from
the branches of this text, The Lord swear,

And will not repent. Is not this addition needless and superfluous? Does God
ever repent him of any thing? May we be bold to use any such speech concerning
God, that he repented or retracted any thing? We may, the Scripture will bear
us out in it, which in many places warranteth the phrase; as, Genesis 6.6.
Then it repented the Lord that he had made man upon the earth, and he was
sorry in his heart: and, 1 Samuel 15.35
It repents me that I have made Saul King; for he is turned from me, and has
not performed my commandments: and, Psalm. 106.15.
He remembered his covenant, and repented, according to the multitude of his
mercies: and, Jer. 18.10.
If this Nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their wickedness,
I will repent of the plagues that I thought to bring upon them; but if they do
evil in my sight, I will repent of the good that I thought to do unto them:
therefore now amend your ways and your works, and hear the word of the Lord
God, that the Lord may repent him of the plagues that he has pronounced
against you: and, Jon. 3.9.
God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways, and God
repented of all the evil that he had said he would do unto them, and he did it
not. All which passages I have entirely related, quia de Deo etiam vera dicere
periculosum est, as the heathen Hill. de Trin. l. 5. Non potest Deus nisi per
Deum intelligi, a Deo discendum est quid de Deo intelligendum est
Sage wisely observes, It is dangerous to speak even true things of God; for
we may speak nothing safely of him which is not spoken by him in holy
Scriptures. And above others the Ministers of the Gospel have a special charge
given them, not only to look to their matter, but to have a care also,
retinere sanam formam verborum, to keep unto a wholesome platform of words
and phrases, such as all those are which the holy Ghost has sanctified unto
us, whereof this is one, God repented, etc. which may be safely uttered, if it
be rightly understood. Certain it is, and a most undoubted truth, that the
nature of God is free from passion, his actions from exception, his will from
control, his purpose from casualty, his sentence from revocation; and
therefore when God is said in holy Scripture to repent of any good by him
promised, or actually conferred upon any, or any evil inflicted or menaced, we
are not from thence to infer, that there are any after-thoughts in God, but
only some alteration in the things themselves. As Parents and Nurses, that
they may be the better understood of their Infants, clip their words, or speak
in a like tone to them; so also our heavenly Father, (...), that we may the
better understand him, speaks to us in our own language, Number. 23.19. God is
not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent: has
he said, and shall be not do it? has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
and expresses himself in such terms as best sort with our conceits and
apprehensions. When we condemn the courses which we have formerly taken, or
undo any thing which we have done, our after-thoughts check our former, and
we retract our error; and this retraction of our opinions, and change in our
mind, we call repentance: which, though it be far from the nature of God,
yet is it by a figure attributed unto him, the more significantly to express
his infinite hatred and detestation of sin, in regard whereof he cast man out
of his favor, as if he had repented that he had made him: he cast Saul out of
his throne, as if he had repented that he had set him in it: as also to
represent his compassionate love toward penitent sinners, which prevails so
far with him, that upon the least relenting and humiliation on our parts, he
reverseth the fearful sentence he passed upon us, as if it repented him that
he ever had pronounced it. We repeal some act or constitution of ours, or
cancel some deed, because we repent of that which formerly we had done: but
God is said to repent, not because his mind or affection is changed, but
because his actions are such, as when the like are done by men they truly
repent. Thus St. L. 9. de Civ. Dei. Poenitentiae nomen usurpavit effectus, non
illius turbulentus affectus.
Austine resolves the case, Some such effects, which in men proceed from
repentance, descried in the Actions of God, have occasioned these and the like
phrases, God repented, and was sorry in his heart.

Yea, but what effects are these? Has he ever reversed any sentence, repealed
any act, nay, recalled so much as any word passed from him? Is the 1 Samuel 15.29.
strength of Israel as man that he should lie, or as the son of man that he
should repent? Is not he the H^b. 13.8.
same yesterday, and to day, and for ever? Are not all his menaces and
promises, all his mercies and judgments, all his words and works 2 Cor. 1.20.
For all the promises of God in him are Yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of
God by us.
Yea and Amen? Doubtless it shall stand for an unmovable truth, when heaven
and earth shall pass away, Mal. 3.6. Ego Deus, non mutor, I am the Lord, I
change not: therefore we are yet in the suds, there appears no ground to
fasten repentance upon God, either quoad affectum, or quoad effectum. But here
the Aquin. par. 1. q. 16. art. 7. Aliud est mutare voluntatem, aliud velle
mutationem.
Schoolmen reach us a distinction to take hold on, whereby we may get out of
the mire: It is one thing to change the will, and another thing to will a
change. God wills a change in some things at some times, but he never
changes his will. Some things God appoints to continue for ever, as the
dictates of the law of nature, and the Priesthood of Christ: some things for a
time only, as the Legal Ceremonies, and the Aaronicall Priesthood. Again,
some things he promises absolutely, as all spiritual graces necessary to the
salvation of the Elect: some things conditionally, as the blessings of this
life, so far as they tend to the attaining of a better hereafter. In like
manner, some judgments he denounces absolutely, as the destruction of the
kingdom of Satan and Antichrist; others upon condition expressed or
understood, as the subversion of Niniveh, the present death of Hezekiah.

To apply these distinctions to our purpose, and close upon the very point in
question: when any order, set down by God for a time, alters at the time,
the date being expired, or any Prophecy depending upon a condition, falls
with it, God is said to repent, though he indeed do nothing less; the change
that appears in the things themselves being nothing else but the execution of
an unchangeable decree of God for their change. The meaning then of this
phrase, will not repent, is, that the Priesthood of Christ is not like that of
Aaron, which was after a time to expire, and is now actually with all the
ceremonial law abolished, but a Priesthood never to be altered or changed. The
Lord swear, and will not repent,

Thou art a Priest. There are three things that especially appertained to the
office of Aaron and his Successors:

1 To keep the original and authentical copy of the law, together with the
golden pot of Manna, and the two tables written with the finger of God, and the
Rod that budded.

2. To offer sacrifices both ordinary every day, and upon their set feasts and
sabbaths, and extraordinary upon special occasions. 1. Either to profess
their thankfulness to God, and magnify his goodness; which may be called
gratulatory, or eucharisticall. 2. Or to confess their sins and appease his
wrath; which are called expiatory, or propitiatory.


3. To present themselves before God for the people, to assure on their part
obedience to God, by way of promise or stipulation, and procure Gods favor to
them by way of mediation.

All which parts of their Priestly function they performed but typically and
imperfectly: for neither did they keep the Law entirely, nor so much as the
copy of it in later times, neither did their sacrifices purge thoroughly,
neither did their prayers prevail effectually: but our high Priest has
fulfilled all righteousness, and by one oblation of himself has made a
perfect satisfaction for the sins of the whole world: and he is in that grace
and favor with God, that he puts up no petition on our behalf, but he
gets it signed by his Father. The Leviticall Priests laid up the true
original of the Law, both written in the books of Moses, and engraven in the
two Tables, in the Arc, as a jewel in a sacred casket: but our high Priest
both kept the Law it self, and perfectly fulfilled it, and writes it also in
the tables of our hearts: they presented offerings for the sin of the soul,
but he made his soul an offering for sin: Esaias 53.10.
they appeared but once a year in the Holy of holies for the people, but he
being entered into the Sanctum sanctorum, the Heaven of heavens, sits at the
right hand of his Father, and perpetually by the merits of his passion
intercedeth for us.

Now the reasons which moved him to take upon him this office of a Priest, are
conceived to be these:

1. Because the salvation and redemption of mankind, wrought by the sacrifice
of his Priesthood, being a most noble work, and not inferior to the creation,
it was not fit that any should have the honor of it but the Son of God.

2. Neither was it agreeable that any should offer him, who was the only
sacrifice that could expiate the sins of the whole world, but himself:
therefore by offering himself, he added infinite worth to the sacrifice, and
great honor to the Priesthood of the Gospel. For, as the gold sanctified not
the altar, but the altar the gold; so it may be truly said without impeachment
to the dignity of that calling, that Christ was rather an honor to the
Priesthood, than the Priesthood an addition unto him. For what got he by the
Priesthood, which cost him his life? what preferment could it be to him, to
take upon him an office, whereby he was to abase himself below himself, and
be put to an ignominious and accursed death? What were we vile miscreants,
conceived and borne in original sin, and soyled with the filth of
numberless actual transgressions, that to purge and cleanse our polluted
souls and defiled consciences, the second person in Trinity should be made a
Priest? It was wonderful humility in him to wash his Disciples feet, but in
his divine person to wash our unclean souls, is as far above humane
conceit, as it seems below divine majesty. There is nothing so impure as a
foul conscience, no matter so filthy, no corruption so rotten and unsavory as
is found in the sores of an exulcerated mind; yet the Son of God vouchsafed
to wash and bathe them in his own blood. O bottomless depth of humility and
mercy! other Priests were appointed by men for the service of God, but he was
appointed by God for the service and salvation of men: other Priests spilt the
blood of beasts to save men, but he shed his own blood to save us, more like
beasts than men: other Priests offered sacrifice for themselves, he offered
himself for a sacrifice: other Priests were fed by the sacrifices which the
people brought, but he feeds us with the sacrifice of his own body and blood:
Lastly, others were appointed Priests but for a time, he was ordained a Priest

For ever. The rod of Aaron was a type of the Priesthood of Christ, which
shoots forth three buds or blossoms: 1. Obedience, the fruit whereof is our
righteousness. 2. Sacrifice, the fruit whereof is our satisfaction. 3.
Intercession, the fruit whereof is our confidence and bold access to the
throne of grace.


The two first buds seemed to wither at our Saviors death, though the fruit
thereof be still preserved, but the third, though it put it self forth in his
life time, yet it more flourished after his ascension. For although our blessed
Redeemer now no more observe the ceremonial Law, to which he gave a period at
his consummatum est, nor offer any more sacrifice of his own, yet he still
offers up our sacrifices of praises and thanksgiving, he still presents us
unto God, and labors to reconcile God unto us; he lays open before his
Father his bloody wounds and stripes, and by them beseeches him to have mercy
upon us; and in this respect, as well because the dignity of his Priesthood
still remains in himself, and the effect in us, as because continually he
blesses us, and mediateth for us, he is styled a Priest for ever: not such a
Priest as the Levites were, who held their office for their life, and after
left it to their successors, who were in the end to resign it into the hands
of a Mediator; but such a Priest as Melchizedek was, a singular Priest, an
everlasting Priest, a royal Priest, a Priest who neither succeeded any, nor
any him, a Priest for ever

After the order of Melchizedek. For the opening of this passage three points
are to be cleared: 1. The name. 2. The person. 3. The order or office of this
singular and extraordinary type of Christ.


1. Touching the name, though it be one word in the Greek and Latin, and
carry the form of a proper name, yet in the original it is two; (...), and
seems rather to be an appellative, signifying my righteous Lord, or the
righteous Lord of my appointment: as Psalm. 2.6. I have set my King, etc.
Howbeit, as the name of Augustus was the common style of all the Roman
Emperors, yet (...) the surname of Octavius, from whom the rest received it;
so it is not unlikely, that the style of Melchizedek was at the first
attributed to this famous King of Salem, who met Abraham with a present as he
returned from the slaughter of the Kings; yet afterward, either by adulation,
or for other reasons, it might be given to his successors.

Of the interpretation of this name we can make no doubt, since the Apostle has
construed it unto us (viz.) Hebr 7.2.
King of righteousness, and after that, King of Salem, which is King of peace;
whence some gather consequently, that the most righteous Kings are most
peaceable, and that he can be no King of peace, who is not a King of
righteousness. Where righteousness does flourish, there shall be abundance of
peace. As in the name of Melchizedek King of Salem, so in the heart of every
good King righteousness and peace ought to kiss each other. Now Christ is a
King of righteousness in three respects: 1. Administrando, because he
administreth. 2. Operando, because he wrought and still works. 3. Imputando,
because he imputes righteousness.


He administreth righteousness, because he rules his Church with a Psalm. 45
6. The scepter of thy Kingdom is a right scepter.
scepter of righteousness: he wrought righteousness in fulfilling the Law,
which is called Mat. 3.15. Thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness.
righteousness, and by his grace also he enableth us to work righteousness,
and in some good measure to fulfill his commandments: he imputes
righteousness, when he justifies the ungodly, and accounts faith for Romans
4.5.
righteousness to him that works not, but believes: for God made him that
knew no sin, to be 2 Cor. 5.21.
sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him, that no
flesh should glory in his presence: for of him are 1 Cor. 1.30.
we in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption.

2. Touching the person of Melchizedek, there are six opinions: the first,

1. Of certain Heretics, called the Melchizedekians, who taught, that
Melchizedek was a Epiph. haeres. 55.
power of God greater than Christ, and that he was the Mediator and Advocate
of Angels, as Christ is of men.

2. Of Hierax the Egyptian and his followers, who taught, that Melchizedek was
Ystella in Genesis 14.
Christ himself, who before his incarnation appeared in a humane shape to
Abraham.

3. Of the author of the book, q. Vet. and N. Test. who writes, that
Melchizedek is the Holy Ghost.

4. Of Origin and Didymus, who thought Melchizedek to be an Hieron. ep. ad Evag.
Angel.

5. Of Aben Ezra, Bagud Haturim, Levi Benyerson, David Chimki, and of the Jer.
and Epiph. loc sup. cit.
Samaritans and Hebrews generally, who confidently affirm, that Melchizedek
was Shem the son of Noah.

6. Of Coel. hierarc. c. 9. Haeres. 55. in Genesis 14.
Dionysius Areopagita, Epiphanius, Theodoret, Hippolytus, Procopius, Eusebius,
Eustathius, Calvin, Junius, Musculus, Mercerus, Pererius, Pareus, and diverse
others, who hold it most probable that this Melchizedek was one of the Kings of
Canaan.

In this variety of opinions, backed with manifold authorities, as Tully spoke
of the soul, that it was less difficult to resolve what she is not, than what
she is; so we may say of Melchizedek, that it is a far easier matter to
determine who he was not, than who he was.

power of God greater than our Savior, or the Angels Advocate: for neither is
there any inequality between the divine persons, neither have the evil Angels
any Advocate to plead for them, who are condemned already, and reserved in
chains of darkness till the great day. The text of Scripture which they
wrested to their fancy, no way advantageth them. For Christ is said, a Priest
after the order of Melchizedek, not because he was inferior to him in person
or office, but because he succeeded him in time, and bare an office framed
after a sort according to the pattern of his.

Melchizedek was a glorious type of Christ, and is said Hebr. 7.3. (...).
assimilari, to be likened to the Son of God: he was not therefore the Son of
God, but his forerunner in the office of Priesthood.

Moses describes him to be a man that ruled in Salem, and executed also the
office of a Priest to God: which cannot be affirmed of the Holy Ghost, who
never took our nature upon him, nor is any where in holy Scripture termed a
Priest of the most high God. The only footing which this opinion has, is upon
that ground, that Melchizedek is said to be Hebr. 7.3.
without father; which ground no way supporteth this opinion. For we cannot
argue from one attribute of Melchizedek affirmatively, though we may
negatively. This argument is good, He that has a father reckoned among men, is
not Melchizedek; but this is not so, The Holy Ghost is without father,
therefore he is Melchizedek. For God the Father, the first person in Trinity
is, as also Adam the first man was, without father or mother, yet neither of
them Melchizedek.

Melchizedek did from the hands of Abraham? These four opinions have been long
ago exploded, the two remaining stand still in competition for the truth.

5. The advocates for Sem plead hard: Sem (say they) as appears in the story
of Genesis, lived to the time of Abraham's victory, and to him it was promised,
that the Canaanites should be his servants, and consequently that Salem their
Metropolis should be his seat, where Melchizedek was King. Neither was there
any greater man than Abraham, to whom that great Patriarch should do homage,
and pay tithes, save Sem. Lastly, those prerogatives of Melchizedek (without
father, without mother, without beginning of days, or end of life) agree best
to Sem, who might be said to be without these, either in the notice of the
text, or in the speech of men: because he was now so aged, and had lived so
long after the Flood, that no man then living remembered his Parents. He might
likewise be said to be without beginning of days in respect of the new world
after the Flood, and without end of life in respect of the old world before the
Flood.

Sem, the truth goes not so clear for him, but that it is encountered with
many and great difficulties. For there is no ground to believe that Sem left
the East, and set up his rest in Calvin. in Genesis 14. Neque enim virum aeterna
memoria dignum, Dominus novo tantum and obscuro nomine indicasset, ut maneret
ignotus; neque probabile est Semum ex Orient migrasse in Judaeam.
Judea: neither is it likely that the Spirit would have described a man worth
eternal memory in such an obscure manner, and under such a new name, that he
remains yet unknown. Were he Sem, why should Moses conceal his name?
Moreover, the Apostle in the seventh of the Ver. 6.
Hebrews says in express words, that the pedigree of Melchizedek is not
accounted among men; but Sems is, as we read in Genesis 10.22.
Genesis: neither is it a solid answer, which yet is given by many learned men,
to say that Sems genealogy is not accounted by the name of Melchizedek. For no
more is Jacobs accounted by the name of Israel, yet none thereupon would say
that Jacobs genealogy is not set down by Moses. The Apostles comparison
stands not in the bare name, but in the person of Melchizedek: whether by the
name of Melchizedek, or by the name of Sem his pedigree be set down, it is
certain he cannot be that man whom St. Paul in this resembles to Christ,
that he was without father or mother accounted among men, for his Parents are
upon record.

6 What then shall we conclude? Either that he was a Ruler of Canaan, Confirm.
6.
whose genealogy is no where set down, nor the day of his birth nor death; or
that he was a man immediately sent from God, and showed only to the earth, and
afterward taken away after the manner of Enoch, or Elias, that he might be
likened in all things to the Son of God; or that the Apostle has an eye
only to Moses his relation, in that place where Melchizedek is brought in by
him, blessing Abraham, and receiving tithes from him, without any mention there
of his Parents in the flesh, or successor in his office, or day of his birth
or death. So are we to conceive of our high Priest, who was without father
according to his manhood, without mother touching his Godhead, and in his
person, which was merely divine, without beginning of days, or end of years.

3 Touching his order or offices, it is certain that he was both King and
Priest. For he was King of Salem, and Priest of the most high God: the
conjunction of which two offices was not unusual in those elder times among
the heathen: for by the light of nature they saw such majesty in the person of
a King, and eminency in the office of a Priest, that they judged none so
worthy of the Priesthood as their Kings, nor any so capable of the Kingdom as
their Priests: and therefore in most places they either crowned their Priests
and gave them power; or sacred their Kings, and gave them orders. Right so does
Virgil describe Anius, as Moses does Melchizedek, invested with both dignities:
Virg. Aen. 3.
Rex idem Anius, Phoebique Sacerdos.

At this day the Kings of the East Indians are styled Brameres, that is,
Priests, and by the law are to die in a holy place, as persons sacred to God.
Arist. pol. (...).
Aristotle remembers such an ancient custom among the Grecians, Res divinae
committebantur Regibus; and Cic. pro dom. ad Pontif. Cum multa divinitus a
majoribus nostris inventa atque instituta sunt, tum nihil prae^larius quam quod
eosdem religionibus deorum immortalium and summae reip. prae esse voluerunt.
(...). Vid. Lips. polit. l. 4 c. 1.
Tullie among the Romans: and Stobeus sets a fair color upon it, The best
of all, that is, God, ought to be honored and served by the best, that is, the
Prince; and the service of God, which is or should be, in all well ordered
States, the chiefest of all cares, ought to be the care of the chiefest, that
is, the King: which made Lycurgus, the Lawgiver of the Lacedaemonians,
ambitious of the title of the Priest of Apollo, and Solon of Priest of Minerva,
and induced Mercurius Trismegistus, Augustus, Titus, and Trajan, to assume this
sacred title into their style, and annexe the Priesthood to the Crown. Ovid.
Fast. l. 1. and l. 3. Et fiunt ipso sacra colente Deo.
Accessit titulis Pontificalis honos.

Wherein they may all seem to have taken Melchizedek for their pattern, who
the first of all that ever we read, mingled both oils, and compassed the
Mitre with a Crown; bearing a Scepter in one hand, and a Crozure in the other,
more fully to represent the Son of God, who remains a Priest, and reigns
a King for ever.

This resemblance between them satisfies not our Adversaries, they strain
this text hard to draw blood from it, even the blood of Christ sacrificed in
the Mass. If (say they) Christ be a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek, then he must daily offer a sacrifice unto God under the forms of
bread and wine, as also did Melchizedek. And this is the fairest evidence they
bring out of Scripture for the sacrifice of the Mass. Against which we object,

1 That neither the Hebrew letter, nor the vulgar Latin, the authority whereof
no Papist dare impeach, imports that Melchizedek offered bread and wine, but
Genesis 4.18.
brought forth; protulit, non obtulit.

2 Admit of the word offered; what say they to Rabbi Solomon, Tertullian,
Ambrose, yea, Andradius also, and other Papists of note, who refer this
offering to Abraham, not to God? the bread and wine he offered was a present to
Abraham, not a sacrifice to God. Obtulit (say they) Abrahamo panem and vinum;
and will they make no difference between an office of civility and a sacrifice
of religion?

3 Admit Melchizedek offered this bread and wine, or some part of it, to God,
yet does not the Spirit of God recommend his Priesthood, as being any way
remarkable for the sacrifice he offered, but for the blessing wherewith he
blessed Abraham. For so it follows in the text, ver. 19, 20. And he was the
Priest of the most high God, and he blessed him, and said, etc. And from this
act of his office the Apostle infers, that H^b. 7.7.
Melchizedek was a Priest of a higher order and rank than Levi, who blessed
him in the loins of Abraham, and received tithes from him: Without
contradiction, says the Apostle, the less is blessed of the greater.

4 Admit that his Priesthood were as remarkable for his offering, as for his
blessing, yet all this comes short of the point in question, to prove that
Christ is said to be a Priest after the order of Melchizedek, in regard of his
sacrifice of bread and wine. For Christ never offered a sacrifice of bread and
wine, as we are all upon an accord, the sacrifice which he offered was his body
and blood.

5. Had he offered at his last Supper a sacrifice of bread and wine, and not
instituted a Sacrament in bread and wine, yet that offering would not entitle
him to the Priesthood of Melchizedek, more than to the Priesthood of Levi. For
the Priests of the Law also offered bread and wine. Doubtless there must be
something eminent and extraordinary in the Priesthood of Melchizedek, in
regard whereof Christ is said to be a Priest after his order: and we need not
seek far for singular resemblances between them, the Apostle has excellently
paralleled them in the seventh of the Hebrews. 1 Melchizedek, by
interpretation King of righteousness: Christ, The Lord our righteousness.
2 Melchizedek, King of Salem: Christ, the Prince of peace.
3 Melchizedek, without genealogy reckoned among men: Christ, without Father
touching his manhood, without mother touching his Godhead.
4 Melchizedek blesses Abraham: Christ blesses all the seed of the faithful
Abraham.
5 Melchizedek, a pattern without pattern, and president without any former
president: Christ made after an order, after which there was no order.



To contract all in brief: Melchizedek was a Priest, 1 Singular in his person:
for he neither succeeded any, nor any him. 2 Royal in his place: for his
Kingdom was his Diocese. 3 Perpetual in his office: for his Priesthood was
never abrogated.


And in these respects chiefly Christ is styled a Priest after the order of
Melchizedek, that is to say, a Singular Everlasting Royal
Priest

Had there been yet a more special and remarkable agreement between Christ
and Melchizedek in regard of the sacrifice of bread and wine, how comes it to
pass that the Apostle omitteth it, where professedly he compares them, and
makes use even of nominall conveniences between them? He who presses verbal
congruities, would he have pretermitted any real, especially such an one, as,
if it were true, were more remarkable than all the rest? viz. that as
Melchizedek offered no flesh of beasts to God, or bloody sacrifice, but bread
and wine; so Christ at his last Supper offered himself, and has commanded the
Priests of the Gospel to the end of the world to offer a daily unbloudie
sacrifice, under the forms of bread and wine.

They will peradventure reply, that though the Apostle for some special
reason pretermitted this resemblance between them, yet the ancient Fathers
have not baulked it. For St. Ep. l. 2. ep. 3. ad Cecil. Sacrificium Deo patri
obtulit, and obtulit hoc idem quod Melchizedek.
Cyprian says in express terms, that Christ offered a sacrifice to God his
Father, and he offered the same which Melchizedek had done, to wit, bread and
wine. And St. Hieron. ep. ad M^rc. Melchizedek in typo Christi panem and vinum
obtulit, and mysteriu^ Christianorum in Salv^toris corpore and sanguine
dedicavit.
Jeromes words are as direct, Melchizedek in a figure offered bread and wine,
and dedicated the mystery of Christians in the body and blood of our Savior.
And Eusebius Eusebius. Emissen. Sermon. 5. de Pasch. Melchizedek oblatione panis and
vini Christi sacrificium figuravit.
Emissenus speaks as fully as either St. Cyprian or St. Jerome; Melchizedek
in offering bread and wine prefigured Christ's sacrifice. This I confess is the
language of some of the Ancients, whose words notwithstanding, though put upon
the tentors of a Jesuiticall interpretation, and stretched to the utmost, will
not reach home to their purpose. For they pass not beyond one of these points,
either that Christ resembles Melchizedek in this, that as Melchizedek brought
forth bread and wine to refresh Abraham and his army; so he at his last Supper
brought forth bread and wine before his Disciples, and instituted a Sacrament
by them to refresh their souls: or that Christ offered that in substance and
verity which Melchizedek offered in type and figure, to wit, his body and
blood. Thus St. Cyprian expresses himself in the same sentence, saying, He
offered the same which Merchizedek did, bread and wine, suum scilicet corpus
and sanguinem, to wit, his body and blood. And the Author of the Treatise De
coena Domini, who carries the name of St. Cypr. de unct. Chris. Dedit itaque
Dominus noster in mensa in qua ultimum cum Discipulis participavit convivium
propriis manibus panem and vinum, in Cruce vero manibus militum corpus tradidit
vulnerandum, ut^ Apostolis secretius impressa sincera veritas, and vera
sinceritas exponeret gentibus, quomodo panis and vinum caro esset and sanguis,
and quibus rationibus causae effectibus convenirent, and diversa nomina vel
species ad unam reducerentur essentiam, and significantia and significata
^isdem vocabulis censerentur.
Cyprian, very well clears the matter, saying, Christ at his last Supper
delivered with his own hands bread and wine to his Disciples, but on the
Cross rendered his body into the hands of the Soldiers, to be wounded and
crucified, to verify the type, and accomplish the figure, and fully resemble
the pattern of Melchizedek. And this may serve for the sense and construction
of this text of Scripture: let us now see how it may serve for our use and
instruction.

First, it instructs us in the lawful use of an oath, which is here
warranted by the practice of God himself, Juravit Jehova, The Lord swear.

Secondly, in the certainty of our salvation, grounded upon the immutability
of Gods purpose, He will not repent.

Thirdly, in the dignity of the Priesthood of the Gospel, which was the
calling of our blessed Lord and Savior, Thou art a Priest.

Fourthly, in the abrogation of all legal rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices,
by the perpetual Priesthood of Christ. But because these are paths trod by
every one, I will proceed to the three last observations.

Fifthly, in the necessity of order in the Church, Sacerdos secundum ordinem.
Though Christ were a singular and extraordinary Priest, yet he had a
president, and was made after an order: he who ordains all, would be ordained
himself, to establish order in the Ministry. As Christ himself, so all
Ministers of holy things, must be secundum ordinem, after some order. I demand
then after what order our Popist Priests are made? whether after the order of
Aaron or Melchizedek? If after the order of Aaron, then are they to offer
bloody sacrifices, and perform other carnal rites, long ago abrogated: if
after the order of Melchizedek, then they are very happy. For then they are to
be Kings and Priests, then they are not to succeed any other, nor any other
them: then, as has been showed, they are singular, everlasting, and royal
Priests. We may put a like interrogatorie to many of our Brownists or
Anabaptisticall Teachers, who run before they are sent, and answer before they
are called; being like wandering stars, fixed in no certain course; or wild
corn, growing where they were not sown; or like unserviceable pieces of
Ordnance, which fly off before they are discharged. If men, though endowed
with gifts, might discharge a Pastoral function, or do the work of an
Evangelist, without a lawful mission, St. Paul's question had been to little
purpose, Romans 10.15.
How shall they preach unless they be sent? What calling have these men?
ordinary or extraordinary? If ordinary, where are their orders? if
extraordinary, where are their miracles? If Christ himself would not take
upon him the Priesthood till he was called thereunto, as Aaron, what
intolerable presumption is it in these, not to take, but to make their own
commission, and to call men by the Gospel without a calling according to the
Gospel. It is not more unnatural for a man to beget himself, than to ordain
himself a Priest. But because these men will not be ordered by reason, I leave
them to authority, and come to the

Sixth observation, which is the Prerogative of Christ, Obs. 6.
who was ordained a Priest of Melchizedeks order, whereby he was qualified to
bear both offices, Kingly and Priestly. For that Christ alone may execute both
charges, besides the fair evidence of this Scripture, Uzziahs judgment makes
it a ruled case, who presuming to burn incense to the Lord, incensed the wrath
of God against himself. A rare and singular judgment, and worthy perpetual
memory; he who, not content to sway the royal Scepter, would lay hold on the
Censer, and discharge both offices, was for ever discharged of both: and even
then when he took upon him to cleanse the people, was smitten with a foul and
unclean 2 Chr. 26.20.
disease. So dangerous a thing is it, even for Sovereign Princes, the Lords
Anointed, to encroach upon the Church, and assume unto themselves and usurp
Christ's prerogative. Whereof the Bishops of Roane and Rhemes were bold to bid
their Sovereigne Lewis, the then French King, beware, informing him, Quod solus
Christus fieri potuit Rex and Sacerdos, that it was the prerogative of Christ
alone to bear both offices. And Pope Causab. l. de libert. Eccles. Gratian.
did. 96. cum ad verum.
Nicolas himself concurreth with them in judgment; When the truth, that was
Christ, says he, was once come, after that neither did the Emperor take upon
him the Bishops right, nor the Bishop usurp the Emperors, because the same
Mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus, distinguishes the offices of
each power, assigning unto them proper actions, to the end that the Bishop,
which is a soldier of Christ, should not wholly entangle himself in worldly
affairs: and again, the Prince, which is occupied in earthly matters, should
not be ruler of divine things, viz. the preaching of the Word, and
administration of the Sacraments. To make a medley (says Syn. ^p.
Synesius) of spiritual and temporal power, is (...). There is great
difference between the Scepter and the Censer; the Chair of Moses, and the
Throne of David; the tongue of the Minister, and the hand of the Magistrate;
the material sword that kills, and the spiritual that quickens. To the
King (says St. De verb. Esa.
Chrysostom) are the bodies of men committed, to the Priest their souls: the
King pardons civil offenses and crimes, the Priest remitteth the guilt of
sin in the conscience: the King compels, the Priest exhorts: the Kings
weapons are outward and material, the Priests inward and spiritual. A like
distinction St. Hieron. ad Heliod Rex nolentibus praeest, Episcopus volentibus,
etc.
Jerome makes between them; The King rules men, though unwilling, the Bishop
can do good upon none but those that are willing: the King holds his
subjects in awe with fear and terror, the Priest is appointed for the service
of his flock: the King mastereth their bodies with death, the Priest
preserves their souls to life. But the farthest of any St. Bern. de consid.
ad Eugen. Reges gentium dominantur^^s, vos non sic; aude ergo usurpare, aut
Dominus Apostolatum, aut Apostolicus Dominatum.
Bernard presses this point, and touches Pope Eugenius to the quick: It is
the voice of the Lord, Kings of the Nations rule over them, etc. But it shall
not be so with you; go to then, usurp if thou dare, either an Apostleship, if
thou art a Lord; or Lordlike dominion, if thou art an Apostle: thou art
expressly forbid both: if thou will have both, thou shall lose both.

But why do I prosecute this point? Does it concern any now adays? Does any
one man bear both these offices? I answer affirmatively, the High Priest at
Rome does. For he compasses his Mitre with a triple Crown: and, as if he bare
this name written upon his thigh, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, challenges
to himself a power to depose Kings, and dispose of their Kingdoms. Does any
one desire to know who is that man of sin, spoken of by the 2 These. 2.3.
Apostle, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God? Let
him learn of the Prophet who are called gods, (Dixi dii estis, Psalm. 82.6.
I have said ye are gods) and it will be no matter of great difficulty to
point at him who accounts that he does Kings a great honor when he
admits them to kiss his feet, hold his stirrup, serve him at table, and
perform other baser offices, prescribed in their book of ceremonies. I can
tell you who it was that made the Emperor Henry the fourth, with his Queen
and young Prince, in extreme frost and snow, to wait his leisure three days,
barefooted and in woollen apparel, at the gates of Canusium: it was Gregory
the seventh, otherwise called Hildebrand. I can show you who set the Imperial
Crown upon the head of Henry the sixth, not with his hand, but with his foot,
and with the same foot kicked it off again, saying, I have power to make
Emperors, and unmake them at my pleasure: it was Pope Coelestine. I can bring
good proof who it was that would not make peace with Frederick the first, till
in the presence of all the people, at the door of St. Marks Church in Venice,
the Prince had cast his body fl^t on the ground, and the Pope setting his foot
on his neck, advanced himself, blasphemously wresting the Scripture, and
applying those words of the Psalmist to himself, Psalm. 91.13.
Thou shall tread upon the Lion and the Basilisk: it was Pope Adrian, who was
afterward choked with a fly. I could relate unto you in what Council divine
majesty is ascribed to the Pope, and a power above all powers: in the Council
of Lateran, under Leo the tenth. But I tremble at such horrible blasphemies,
and leave the Authors and maintainers of them to the censure of the true
Melchizedek; who, as he is a Prince of peace, so he is also Rex justitiae, King
of righteousness, and will one day right himself, and all his servants, and
destroy the man of sin with the breath of his mouth, and brightness of his
presence.

7. The next point in which this Text instructs us, is the strength and
validity of an oath. God, when he would show unto us the immutability of his
decree concerning Christ's Priesthood, confirms it unto him by an oath,
thereby declaring, that the greatest evidence of truth, and strongest assurance
of faith between man and man, nay between God and man, is an oath. It is the
sovereign instrument of justice, the indissoluble bond of amity, the safest
refuge of innocence, the surest warrant of fidelity, the strongest sinew of all
humane society. Detestable therefore and ^amnable is their doctrine and
practice, who strain and weaken the sinew which holds the members of all
politic bodies together: who cancel that bond, which being made on earth, is
registered in the high Court of heaven, and the three persons in the blessed
Trinity are witnesses thereunto: who either untye this everlasting knot by
cunning equivocation; or cut it asunder by Papal dispensation. O my dear
brethren, hold not with them who break with God, swear not to their doctrine,
who maintain forswearing, take not part with that religion which takes away
all religious obligation. Is that (think you) the Orthodoxe faith, which
allows, and in some case commends Aug. de mendac. ad consent.
perfidiousnesse and treachery? Is their doctrine truth, Qui dogmatizant
mendacium? who doctrinally teach the lawfulness of an equivocating lie; an^
that they may verify their doctrine of lies, belie the Truth himself, and
endeavor to make that which I tremble to utter, Jesum ipsum See Parsons sober
reckoning with Thomas Morton, and the same L. Bishop of Duresme Tract. de
aequivocat.
Jesuitam, Jesus himself in this point a Jesuit? O ubi estis fontes
lachrymarum! Of all beasts, we have those in greatest detestation which devour
their own young. What are our words and promises, our vows and oaths, but
the issue of our own mouth? which they, who resume and recall, what do they
other than eat and devour their own offspring? The first that brake his
allegiance in heaven was the Devil, and thereby became a Devil: and the first
that brake promise on the earth was likewise the Devil to Adam and Eve, whose
scholars they show themselves, who teach that the Pope can dispense with the
oath of allegiance, that oaths are better broken than kept with Heretics.
Such was Julius the second, who (if we may believe Bodin. de rep. l. 5. c. 6.
Bodin) was not ashamed openly to profess, Fidem dandam omnibus, servandam
nemini. Such was Alexander the sixth, who when his son Borgias had drawn in
the ringleaders of the contrary faction by fair promises, and deepest
protestations and oaths of pardon and reconciliation, and as soon as he had
them all in his power, put them to the sword; his father applauded this his
perfidious and barbarous act, and cried out, O factum been, O well done, and
according to my hearts desire. Such was Cocleus hist. Hussit. l. 5. anno 1423
Noris te dare fidem haereticis non potuisse, and peccare mort^liter ^^ servaris.
Martin the fifth, who when Alexander Duke of Licuania had sworn to protect
the Hussites, wrote to him in these words, Know that thou could not, nor
might not give faith to Heretics; and that thou sinnest mortally, if thou
keep thy word and oath with them. Such was Hambertus the Ambassador of
Sleia l. 6. Anno 1527. Anno 1577.
Charles the fifth, who when the Lady Katherine, the youngest sister of that
Emperor, was espoused to John Frederick. Duke of Saxony, and the instruments
were drawn and sealed, as soon as ever there was a change of Religion in
Saxony, he persuaded the young Lady to break off the match, affirming openly,
that faith was not to be kept with Heretics. Such were the Popish Divines of
Paris, who both in their Sermons and printed books taught openly, that the
Aug. Thual. hist. l. 63. Aperto capitein concionibus and evulgatis scriptis ad
fidem sectariis servandam non obligari principem cont^ndebant, allato in came
rem Concilii Constantiensis deoreto.
Prince was not bound to keep faith with Sectaries: and to that purpose
alleged a decree of the Council of Constance. Such was Clemens the seventh,
who when Charles the fifth had resolved upon an expedition against the Moors,
to which he had formerly bound himself by oath, sends unto him a Bull,
whereby he releaseth him of all oaths that he had taken for the expulsing
those Infidels, notwithstanding any constitution Apostolical, statute,
ordinance, or oath to the contrary; yea, though ratified by the Sea of Rome
with an express clause of excluding any dispensation or relaxation whatsoever.
Such was Julian the Popes Legate, who persuaded Uladislaus King of Hungary and
Bohemia, to undertake a wicked war against Amurath the Turk, contrary to
oath, assuring him that the Pope allowed of it; and there is no doubt he did
so: but (as Loc. ant. cit.
Bodin observes religiously) Pontifex probavit, Deus immortalis non probavit,
Almighty God allowed not of it: for Uladislaus the King was slain in the
battle, his whole army put to flight, and Julian the Popes Legate mortally
wounded; to whom, as he was now breathing out his last perjured breath, Gregory
Sarmosa exprobated his wicked counsel and pestilent doctrine, saying, I nunc,
Juliane, and dic ^egi tuo apud inferos, Haereticis fidem non esse servandam.
Go to, Julian, and tell the King now in the other world (or in hell) that
faith is not to be kept with Heretics and Infidels.

You have heard how this Text thundereth against the Fathers of the Roman
Church, and all who embrace or practice their perfidious tenets: mark, I
beseech you, now a while how it lighteneth upon the children of our Church, and
all who defend the certainty as well of moral as theological faith. As when
there came a John 12.28.
voice from heaven, Jesus said, This voice came not because of me, Ver. 30.
but for your sakes; so we may truly say of the oath in my Text, God took not
it so much because of Christ, to secure him in his office, as for our sakes, to
assure us of the remission of our sins, purchased by the blood which Christ
as a Priest offered upon the Cross* How are we assured hereof? what security
does he give us? The greatest that ever was taken or given, the oath of
Almighty God. If the bare word of God is able to sustain this whole frame of
nature, shall not his oath be able to support a weak Christian in the hottest
skirmish with Satan, and most dreadful conflict with despair? What though our
consciences be so polluted, that we abhor our selves? yet let us not languish
in despair; for we have a Priest that can cleanse them: there is no stain so
foul, which the blood of Christ will not fetch out. If we have but so much
faith as a grain of mustard seed, we may say with Mors Christi mors meae
mortis, quia ille mortuus est ut ego viv^m: quopacto enim non vivat, pro quo
moritur vita?
Bernard in his divine rapture: The death of Christ is the death of my death,
because he dyed that I might live: for how should he not live, for whom life
dyed? O then in a spiritual dereliction, when our heart is as cold as a stone,
and we are at the very brinke of despair, apprehending the full wrath of God
against us for all our sins, let us not say to the mountains, Cover us, and
to the hills, Fall upon us; but fly to the rock in Horeb, Christ Jesus, and
hide our selves in the holes thereof: Foramina petrae sunt vulnera Christi, The
holes of this rock are the wounds of our Savior: let us by faith run into the
holes of this rock, and fear nothing. Yea, but even there we hear the cry
of our sins like the cry of Sodom; and therefore how can we be safe? Listen
we but a while, and we shall hear another cry far louder, the cry of
Christ's blood, which speaks better things for us than the blood of Abel. Yea,
but how may we be assured that his blood speaks for us, and makes
continual intercession to his Father to be reconciled unto us? By his own
promise and his Fathers oath. If he should neglect to solicit for them, who
truly repenting of their sins by faith rely upon him, he should break his
own word; and neglect the office, to the discharge whereof his Father has
sworn him, saying, Thou art a Priest for ever. How can we ever think, that
he will refuse us, who gave us himself? Will he spare breath for us, who
breathed out his soul for us? Yea, but we sin continually; and he
intercedeth perpetually: he is a Priest for ever. Yea, but we are weak, and
our enemies strong, what can a Priest stead us? he may purge our sins, but
can he save our persons? he may appease the wrath of God, but can he rescue us
from the violence of man? he may stand in the gap between God and us, but can
he stand in the field for our defense against our enemies? That he can: for
he is a Priest after the order of Melchizedek, a Kingly Priest; a Priest to
instruct us, and a King to protect us: a Priest to reconcile us to God, and a
King to subdue our enemies unto us: a Priest to cloth us with his
righteousness, and a King to arm us with his power: a Priest to consecrate us
Priests, and a King to crown us Kings. To whom King and Priest, and to the
Father who ordained him, not by imposition of hands, but by deposition of oath,
and to the holy Spirit who made the instrument and sealed it, three persons,
and one everliving and everloving God, let us as Kings command the utmost
service of our bodies and souls, and as Priests offer them both entirely for
living sacrifices, most agreeable and acceptable to him. Amen.

THE ARC UNDER THE CURTAINS. A Sermon preached in Oxford at the Act, July 12.
Anno 1613. THE XXXVIII. SERMON.
2 SAMUEL 7.2. The King said unto Nathan the Prophet, See now, I dwell in an
house of Cedar, but the Ark of the Lord dwells within curtains.


Right Worshipful, etc.
We read of small or no rain that falls at any time on diverse parts of
Africa; and the cause is supposed to be the sandy nature of the soil, from
whence the Sun can draw no vapors or exhalations, which ascending from other
parts in great abundance, resolve themselves into kind showers refreshing the
earth: This, beloved, is the true reason why God powers not down his benefits
in such plentiful manner as he was wont upon us, because our hearts, like the
dry and barren sands of Africa, send up no vapors of divine meditations,
melting into tears, no exhalation or breath of praise or thanksgiving back to
heaven. Undoubtedly, if we were thankful to God for his benefits, he would
be always beneficial to us for our thankfulness, and account himself
indebted unto us for such acknowledgement of our debt. For there is nothing
that obtains more of him, or deserves better of men, than a thankful
agnition of favors received, and a present commemoration of benefits past. It
is the easy task and imposition which the supreme Lord of all lays upon all
the goods we possess, and blessings of this life, which we receive from his
bountiful hands; and if we be not behind with him in this tribute of our lips,
he will see that all creatures in heaven and earth shall pay their several
tributes unto us: the sun of his heat, the moon of her light, the stars of
their influence, the clouds of their moisture, the sea and rivers of their
fish, the land of her fruits, the mines of their treasure, and all things
living of their homage and service. But if we keep back this duty from him,
which the poorest may pay as well as the rich out of the treasuries of their
own heart, no marvel if he sometimes make fast the windows of heaven, and
lock up the treasures of his bounty, to make us cry to him in our wants and
necessities, who would not sing to him in our wealth and prosperity. Upon this
or the like consideration good King David, as soon as God had given him rest
from all his enemies, thought presently of preparing a resting place for the
Arc. Having therefore a holy purpose to consecrate the spoils he took from
his enemies, to him that gave him victory over them, and to build a stately and
magnificent Temple to the honor of the God of his salvation, and desirous to
receive some encouragement from him, to set to so noble a work, he calls
for Nathan the Prophet, and breaks his mind unto him in the words whereof I
have made choice for my Text: which contain in them, 1. A godly resolution. 2.
A forcible motive.


The resolution is employed, viz. to build God an house; the reason is
expressed, the consideration of his own royal palace. A reason drawn a
dissentaneis, I dwell in a house of Cedar, but the Ark of the Lord within
curtains. Is this decent or fitting, that the King should be better housed
than his maker and advancer to his royal throne? Ye would expect, that
hereupon he should have concluded upon building God an house; but he proposes
only the major, his own house; the minor the Arc, and leaves the Prophet to
infer the conclusion, because in a matter that so nearly concerned the honor
and service of God, he would not seem to lead the Prophet, but rather be led by
him: from whence we may gather three special observations, not unworthy our
most serious thoughts.

1. That in matters immediately appertaining to the service of God and
advancement of religion, the Prophets of God are to be called, and their advice
to be asked and taken, even by Kings themselves.

2. That it is a noble and princely work to build Temples or Churches.

3. That we are to set more by the glory of God, than our own ease and safety,
and rather to desire the erecting of his house, than the raising our own
fortunes. After we have gathered these, there be other which will fall of
themselves from the branches of the Text as we lightly pass over them.

And it came to pass, when the King sat in his house, and the Lord had given
him rest round about from all his enemies, that the King said unto Nathan,
Behold now, etc. The circumstance of time challenges our due consideration in
the first place. It is not usual for men sitting at ease and at rest to
entertain godly motions, and resolve upon works of pious bounty: Otium
pulvinar Satanae, rest is oftentimes the Devils cushion; but here it was not
so, but rather a chair of state for God himself to rest in. After David had
been for a long time pursued by his enemies, and driven from place to place, as
it were powered out of vessel into vessel, when he now stood still, he settled
not upon his lees with Moab; but breathed out these sweet and heavenly
meditations and vows: Behold now I sit at rest, and the Ark of the Lord
tosseth and tumbleth from place to place: I lie safely under a sure roof, able
to bear off wind and weather, and the Ark of God has no better fence than a
few curtains spread over it: the walls of my house are hung with rich arrasse,
and the sides of the Arc are covered but with skins; is it fit that it should
be so, Nathan? Speak thou on Gods behalf, who art his Prophet: Is the Kings
Cabinet more precious than the Lord's Ark? Shall the King have a palace, and
God have no house? Shall I provide a safer place for my records and evidences,
than for the records of heaven, and the tables of the testimony, and the
inspired Oracles of God? This must not be so, I protest it shall not be so: I
Psa. 132.3, 4, 5.
swear unto the Lord, and vow a vow unto the mighty God of Jacob, that I will
not henceforth enter into the tabernacle of my house, nor come upon my bed: I
will not suffer my eyes to sleep, nor my eyelids to slumber, until I find out
a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. Such holy
vows and religious oaths and protestations many of Gods children make in the
depth of their misery; but few (as here David does) in the height of their
prosperity, and the midst of their triumphs. The zeal of most men lies in
their heart like fire in a flint, it must be struck out with some violence;
their prayers and fervent meditations like hot spices are then most fragrant,
when their hearts are bruised in Gods mortar, and broken with afflictions and
troubles. Some such thing befalls the soul in prosperity, as the husbandmen
observe in a fat soil and plentiful year: Luxuriant Ovid. l. 1. de art.
animi rebus plerunque secundis. Prosperity breeds a rankness in the desires
and a dangerous riot of sin: whereof Moses makes great complaint in his
song; But Deuteronomy. 32.15.
Jesurun waxed fat and kicked (thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou
art covered with fatness) then he forsook God that made him, and lightly
esteemed the rock of his salvation: and God by the Prophet Hos. 13.6.
Hosea, According to their pastures so were they filled: they were filled, and
their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. O how great is our
ingratitude? when God most remembers us, we most forget him, drinking our fill
of the rivers of his pleasures, and never thinking of the spring; devouring
greedily the good blessings of God, as Swine do acornes upon the ground, never
looking up to the tree from whence they fall. David was far from this brutish
vice; for as soon as God had destroyed his enemies round about him, he thought
of building a magnificent Temple. When other Kings after so good success and
glorious victories obtained in war would have cast away all care or thought of
Religion, at least for the present, to give the more scope to their licentious
desires and lusts; David confineth himself to his closet, there recounteth the
innumerable benefits God had heaped upon him, and studieth how to express his
gratefulness to him: in fine, he resolves with himself to build a stately
palace for the King of heaven, and sends for the Prophet Nathan to advise
with him about it.

The King said to Nathan the Prophet. David a Prophet himself conferreth with
the Prophet Nathan. Saint Peter a prime Apostle is reproved by the Apostle
Saint Paul. John the elder is instructed by an Elder. Whence we learn, That
Prophets need Prophets advice, Apostles need Apostles admonitions, Elders need
Elders instructions. As two tools whet one the other, and two Diamonds point
each the other, and two Torches mutually light one the other; so it pleases
the wisdom of God to divide the gifts of his Spirit severally among the
Pastors of the Church in different kinds and degrees, that they might be one
bettered by the other. In which consideration, among many others not less
important, the Founders and Benefactors of Collegiate Churches and Universities
have built so many houses for Prophets and Prophets children as you see, to
live together, and by lectures, conferences and disputations, to whet and
sharpen one the other. And if one star, one eminent Doctor in the Church give
so great a light in the dark of ignorance, what a luster, what an ornament
must a College of such Doctors, an University of such Colleges, as it were a
conjunction of many stars, or rather a heaven of many such conjunctions and
constellations uniting their light be? If one aromaticall tree send forth such
a savor of life, as we smell in every particular congregation, what shall we
judge of a grove of such trees? surely it can be no other than the Paradise of
God upon earth. But because David is not here styled the Prophet, but the King
(The King said to Nathan the Prophet,) I rather gather from these words the
great honor which Nathan the Prophet received from David the King, than the
direction or advice that David the King received from Nathan the Prophet.

The King said. Though Kings are Bills suprem. p. 1.
supreme Commanders for the truth, yet they are not the supreme or sole
directers unto truth: for in scruples of conscience and perplexed controversies
of Religion, they are to require the law from the mouth of the Priest, to ask
counsel of the Prophets, and generally in all matters appertaining to God to
hear the Ministers of God declaring to them the will of God out of his Word:
Symmachus was bold to tell Anastasius the Emperor, that as Bishops owe
subjection to Gods Sword in Princes hands, so Princes owe obedience to Gods
Word in Bishops mouths; Causab. de lib. eccles.
Defer Deo in nobis, nos deferemus Deo in te, O Emperor, hear God speaking by
us, and we will fear God ruling by thee. The same God, who has put a
material sword in thy hands, to smite malefactors in their body, has put a
spiritual sword in our mouth, to slay sin in the soul. The Magistrate is
the hand of God, but the Preacher is his mouth. And for this cause all wise and
religious Kings have given them their ears, and taken some of them into their
bosom, as David does here Nathan, to receive instruction and direction from
them how to sway the royal scepter within the walls of the Church.

Let it not seem burdensome unto you, my dearest brethren, upon so just
occasion as is offered me in my Text, to speak somewhat of the honor of that
calling which calls you all to God. From whose mouth do ye hear the glad
tidings of salvation? From whose hands do ye receive the seals of grace? Who
have the oversight and charge of your souls? Who are the means under God to
reconcile God unto you by their prayers, and bring you unto God by their
powerful ministry, but your faithful and painful Pastors, who in
performing these holy duties of their calling, are termed Prosp. de vit.
contem. l. 1. c 25. Hisunt Ministri verbi, Adjutores Dei, Oracula Sp. S.
coadjutores Dei, as it were fellow laborers with God? Per istos Deus placatur
populo, per istos populus instruitur Deo. All other lawful callings are from
God, but this was the calling of God himself: other offices he appointed, this
he executed: others he commends, this he discharged. When he took our flesh
upon him, and lived upon earth, he would not be made a King, nor sit as a Judge
upon a Nisi prius of inheritance; yet performed he the office of a Preacher
through his whole life, and of a Priest at his death; offering himself by the
eternal Spirit upon the high Altar of the Cross, where he was both Confess. l.
10. c. 42. Pro nobis tibi Victor and Victima, and ideo Victor quia Victima: pro
nobis tibi Sacerdos and Sacrificium, and ideo Sacerdos quia Sacrificium;
faciens tibi nos de servis filios.
Victor and Victima, and ideo Victor quia Victima, as St. Austine plays
sweetly in a rhetorical key. May the civil Magistrates glory in this, that
God calls them gods? and may not they that serve at Christ's Altar take as
great comfort, in that God himself calls his Son a Priest, saying, Psalm.
110.4.
Thou art a Priest for ever? Wherefore, if the glorious titles wherewith God
himself graceth the Ministry, of Stewards of his house, Dispencers of his
mysteries, Lights of the world, Angels of the Church: if the noble presidents
in Scripture of Melchizedek King and Priest, David King and Prophet, Solomon
King and Preacher, suffice not to redeem the sacred order from the scandal of
profane men, and contempt of the world; yet, methinkes, since the Son of God,
and King of glory has taken upon him the office, and executed the function of
a Priest, all men should entertain a reverend opinion of the Priesthood of the
Gospel, and not to use the word Priest as a reproach to man, which was one of
the three dignities of God himself, much less seek to disgrace their
persons, who are Gods Instruments to conveigh grace into their souls. What
shall I say more? Nay, what can I say less? He that honors not the name of
Christ, which signifies Luke 4.18.
Anointed to preach the Gospel, is no Christian: he that conceives basely, or
speaks contumeliously of the sacred order of Priests, is worse than an
Infidel. For the heathen Ca sar. Com. de bello Gal.

Lacedaemonians, and almost all the Heathen, who either had Kingly Priests, or
sacrificing Kings, shall condemn such Christians at the day of Christ: then
they shall see of that calling which seemed so vile, dark, and obscure in
their eyes, some glistering as Pearls in the gates, others sparkling as
Diamonds in the foundation, and no small number shining as Stars in the arch
of the heavenly Jerusalem, and amidst them the Sun of righteousness Christ
Jesus, exercising his royal Priesthood, and making intercession to his Father
for all those, and those only, who honor his Priestly function here upon
earth in his Ministers, by maintaining and countenancing them; and in
themselves, by sacrificing their dearest affections to him.

But I list not to dwell on this argument, but rather with the Kingly Prophet
in his house of Cedars.

I dwell in an house of Cedars. In these words David finds not fault with the
beautiful roof of his Princely Palace, but the mean and vile covering of the
Arc: it troubled him not that he was so well provided for, but that the Arc
was so ill. Princes may dwell in houses of Cedars, stately built, and richly
furnished with all the rarities which nature or art affoords. Why were Jewels,
and precious Stones, and rich metals created, but for man's use? And what better
use can be made of them, than to show forth the glory of God, and the
splendor and magnificence of his Vicegerents on earth? Certainly they were
never made to maintain the luxury of private men, which is now grown to that
excess, especially at Court, that the Ambassadors of foreign Princes speak
as loud of it abroad, as the poor cry and wring for it at home. Where shall we
find a Paula, deserving the commendation which St. In Epitaph. Paul. Non in
marmora, sed lapides vivos.
Jerome gives her for laying out her money, not upon marble or freestone, but
upon those living stones which she knew one day should be turned into gemmes,
and laid in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem? Does not the liberality
of most of the wealthy of this age resemble their heart, which is hard, cold,
and stony? The greatest expense they are at is in building houses of Cedar for
themselves, by which they are better known, than their houses by them. As the
world, so the Proverb is turned upside down: it stood thus, Non domus Dominum,
sed Dominus domum: but now it is thus overturned, Non Dominus domum, sed domus
Dominum: the house gets no credit by the owner, but the owner, if he have any,
by the house. Ye will think, when ye come into many of them, that ye are
fallen into an Egyptian Temple, most glorious without, but within nothing to be
seen but the picture of a Jack an Ape, or a Cat, or some such contemptible
creature as that superstitious Nation worshipped. I sharpen my style the more
against this abuse of our age, because it is well known that the superfluous
expense upon the Sepulchers of the dead, and the erecting of houses of Cedars
for the living, far above, I will not say the wealth, but above the rank and
worth of those that dwell in them, is the cause why the Ark of the Lord lies
yet in many places under the curtains; nay, not so well, but under the open
air, without cover or roof to keep out rain and weather. If that which has
been luxuriously cast away in building houses of pleasure, and ambitiously, if
not superstitiously, consumed in erecting Statues, Obelisques, Tombs, or
Monuments for the dead, had been employed in rearing up houses for Prophets,
and erecting Temples to the living God, the Prophets of God should not need to
complain, as now they are constrained, against the men of this age, in the
words of the Prophet Haggai, c. 1. ver. 4. Ye dwell in sieled houses, and the
house of the Lord lies waste: or in the like in my text, Behold, now ye dwell
in houses of Cedars, and

The Ark of the Lord within the Curtains. Before the Sun rise you see no
light, but through mists, and vapors, and shadows on the earth: even so
before the Sun of righteousness Christ Jesus arose in the Firmament of his
Church, there was no light of the Gospel to be seen, but through mists and
obscure shadows; so the Heb. 8.5. and 10.1.
Apostle terms the types and figures of the old Law: among which the
Tabernacle, and in it the Arc, and therein especially the Tables, Rod, and
Pots of Manna, shadowed the state of the Christian Church, and presented to the
eye of faith the principal means of salvation under the Gospel, which are
three: 1 The preaching of the Word, summarily contained in the two Tables. 2
The Sacrament of Christ's body and blood, figured by the Manna. 3 The exercise
of Ecclesiastical discipline, lively set forth by the budding of Aarons rod.


As for Baptism, which is the Sacrament of entrance into the Church, the type
thereof was set at the entry into the Tabernacle, where stood a great Laver,
in which those that came to worship God, after they had put off their clothes,
bathed themselves, as we Christians put off the old man, and wash away the
corruption of original sin in the Font of Baptism, before we are admitted
as members into the Christian Church; whereunto three sorts of men belong: 1
Some that are to be called. 2 Others that are already called into it. 3 Such as
are called out of it into Heaven. 1 The first are in the state of nature. 2 The
second in the state of grace. 3 The third in the state of glory.



Answerable whereunto God commands three spaces or partitions to be made: 1
Atrium, the outward Court, for the people. 2 Sanctum, the holy place, for the
ordinary Priests. 3 Sanctum sanctorum, the most holy place, for the
High Priest to enter once a year, and show himself to God for the people.
Which are similitudes of true things. For as by the outward Court the Priest
went into the holy place, and from the holy place into the most holy; so from
the state of nature the children of God are brought into the state of grace,
and from the state of grace into the state of glory. If any question these
mystical expositions, for the first I refer them to St. Apoc. 11.2.
John, who says expressly, that the Court was given to the Gentiles, and was
not therefore to be mete with a golden reed: for the second, to St. 1 Pet. 2.9.
Peter, who calls all Christians Priests, for whom the holy place was
appointed: for the third to St. Heb. 9.24.
Paul, who opens the veil of that figure, and shows how Christ our
High Priest, after his death, entered into the holy of holies, and there
appeared before God for us. To these observations of the Tabernacle may be
added many the like resemblances between the Arc and the Church. In the
forefront of the Tabernacle there was the Altar of burnt-offerings, and a
place of refuge for malefactors, who, if they could take hold of the horns of
the Altar, were safe. Christ's Cross is this Altar, the horns whereof
whosoever take hold by faith, be they never so great malefactors, escape Gods
vengeance. In the Sanctuary was the mercy seat, toward which the Cherubims
faces looked, to teach us, that the Angels of 1 Pet. 1.12.
heaven desire to look into the mysteries of the Gospel. The dimensions of
the Arc were small, and the limits of the militant Church in comparison of the
malignant are narrow. The outside of the Arc was covered with skins, but the
inside was overlaid with gold: in like manner, the Church has for the most
part no great outward appearance, pomp, or splendor; but yet is always most
Psalm. 45 13.
glorious within. The arc when it was taken by the Philistims conquered Dagon,
and cast him down on his face: even so the Church of Christ, when she is in
captivity and greatest weakness in the eye of the world, gets the better
of her enemies; and is so far from being diminished by persecution, that she
is rather increased by it. For the ashes of Martyrs in this exceed the ashes of
the Phoenix; out of her ashes rises but one Phoenix, but out of the ashes of
one Martyr many hundreds. The Arc at the first was carried on the shoulders of
the Levites, but in later times was put in a 2 Samuel 6.6.
Cart, and drawn by beasts, who shook it, and were like quite to have
overturned it. I need not make the Antapodosis, ye shall find it in the Writers
of the Ecclesiastical story: at the first the Church was governed for near
six hundred years by worthy Prelates and Pastors; but afterward, especially
in some parts, by such as deserved rather the name of beasts than men, and some
of them of monsters than beasts. The arc removed still from place to place,
See Spec. Pontif. Plat. om^h. and M^gaeburg
till Solomon brought it with joy and triumph into the Temple which he had
built for it: even so the militant Church is tumbled and tossed from one
country to another, and shall find no resting place till the true Solomon
Christ Jesus carry her in triumph into the Temple which he has built for her
in heaven; mean while she still remains under the Curtains.

Under the Curtains. The Curtains under which the Arc remained (says an
ancient Father) prefigured the Bishops and Governors of the Church, who are
set in high and eminent places above their brethren, as the Curtains made of
Camels hair and badgers skins were spread over the Arc to cover it, and save
the precious stuff within it from wet and soyling. Which interpretation if we
allow, certainly they who live in Colleges and private Cures, under the
government of Bishops and Prelates, have no cause to envy at their eminent
dignity, but all reason to pray for their safety. For if any storm of
persecution arise and beat upon the Church, the curtains that are uppermost
must bear it off: and while they hold out, the inferior Clergy, who resemble
the inward linings of blew silk, are safe. There are many fruits that are set
in sunny places to ripen them, but as good are scorched and dried up with the
heat of the Sun beams, which would have thrived in the shade. As the coral
branch is fresh and green under the water, but as soon as it appears above
it turns red, according to the motto of the Poets emblem: -- nunc rubeo,
ante virebam. so have we seen many that prospered under the government of
others, and flourished as it were in the shade, who after they came into the
Sun, that is, into the eye of the world, being advanced to great dignities and
preferments, have turned red with the coral, blushed with shame enough, having
too narrow minds for such ample dignities and estates.

Thus I might enlarge and spread my meditations to the full length of the
curtains in my Text; but because I see the time will outstrip me, if I make
not the more haste, and because I see many composing themselves to their rest,
and some fast already, I will begin to draw the curtains, and shut up all that
has been delivered with a brief application to our selves.

Behold now I dwell in an house of Cedars, and the Ark of the Lord within the
curtains. If ever God affected any King above others, David was he, a man
after Gods own heart. If ever David affected any work above others, it was
the building of Gods House, which he solemnly Psalm. 132.2.
vowed, and largely contributed of his 1 Chronicles. 29.
own to it, as we may read in the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. Yet
David, who dedicated himself wholly to God, was not permitted to dedicate a
Temple unto him. David, whose heart so boiled with the zeal of Gods house,
that it consumed away in sighs and tears, and these and the like meditations
and exclamations: Whom have I in heaven, but thee, O Lord? and, O how amiable
are thy dwellings, thou Lord of hosts? My soul is athirst for God, even for
the living God. When shall I come and appear in the presence of God? David,
whose ambition was to be a door keeper in the house of God, and his greatest
envy against the birds that built upon Gods Altars, where he desired to repose
his soul, yet could not obtain the honor to begin, much less to finish the
holy work of building the Temple. What may we conceive to be the reason
hereof? God forbad him. Why did God forbid so good a King to undertake so good
a work? God himself yields a reason, Because his hand had shed much blood.
Yet it may be truly alleged in David's defense, that his wars were just, and
that it was his infelicity, not his fault, that his sword had bin so often
drawn against his enemies. Howsoever, because he had embrued his hands in
blood, God would not suffer him to lay a stone in the foundation of the Temple,
to teach us, that the foundation of the Church is not to be laid in blood.
Spears and Swords are not fit to build withal, Phyfes and Drums are no
proper instruments to sound out the Gospel of peace. Religion is such a
professed friend to peace, and a sworn enemy to bloody wars, that she
suffers not willingly a sword to be drawn in her own defense: How then does
she make her part good against her mortal enemies and cruel persecuters? not
by the Sword, but by the Word; not by Lactan. divin. instit. l. 5. c. 20. Non
occidendo, sed moriendo, non saevitia, sed patientia, non scelere, sed fide;
nam si sanguine, si tormentis, si malo religionem defendere velis, non
defendetur illa, sed polluetur,
violence, but by patience; not by resisting, but by submitting; not by
killing, but by dying. The best armor of a Christian is his proof of
patience, and his only lawful weapons against his lawful Sovereign are
prayers and tears, wherewith S. Ambrose fought against the Arrian Emperor:
Rogamus, Auguste, non pugnamus, we fall down before thee, O Emperor, we rise
not up against thee; we beset thee with petitions, not with arms. And when the
Emperor commanded him peremptorily to give up a Church to the Arrians, he
uses no other violence in withstanding the command of the Heretical Prince,
than of passionate affection; no troops, but tropes: I can sorrow, says he, I
can sigh, I can weep, these are my weapons, by other means I neither may nor
can make resistance: If you seek for my goods, take them: if you desire my
life, I lay it at your feet, I will not stand upon my guard, I will not fly to
Sanctuary to save my life, I will most gladly be sacrified for the Altars of my
God, if it so please you, upon them. This was the ancient carriage of Christian
subjects toward their Sovereign, though infected with heresy, and enraged
against the true professors, not to take arms against them, but to lift up
their hands to heaven for them; not to contest, but to obtest; not to attempt
any thing against them, but cedendo vincere, to conquer them by yielding. But
the General of the Roman military forces has quite altered the ancient
discipline, by turning prayers into threats, supplications into
excommunications, cries into alarums, tears into bullets, and words into
swords: and which is to be bewailed with bloody tears, the Garland of red
Roses (as Saint Cyprian sweetly terms the Crown of Martyrdom) is put upon
their heads, not who dye for the faith, but who kill; not who shed their own
blood, but who draw the blood not of Infidels, but of Christians; not of
private persons, but public; not of subjects, but of Sovereigns. The
detestable oration of Pius made in the Conclave upon the news of the murder of
the French King, and the damnable Legend of Jaques Clement should not have
moved me to have laid so foul an aspersion upon any Romish Priests or
Jesuits, if I had not seen with my eyes at Paris the names of Old corn and
Garnet executed for the Powder Treason, inserted into their Catalogue of
Martyrs; and heard also of certain English Priests sharply censured for
offering to pray for their souls, because thereby they made scruple of their
crown of Martyrdom, which (according to their doctrine) discharges all that
are called unto it from Purgatory flames, and gives them present entrance into
heaven. O blessed Jesu, are these of thy company? did thou make such a
profession before Pontius Pilate? did thou teach thy Disciples to save men's
souls by murdering their bodies, to plant Religion, and found thy Church by
blowing up Parliaments? are these of thy spirit that call not down fire from
heaven, but rather call it up from hell, to consume a whole Kingdom with a
blaze, and offer it up as a Holocaust to the Molock at Rome? No Bosquier. in
Evang. Domin.
fish will be caught in a bloody net: if they see but a drop spilt upon it,
they will swim another way. Therefore let all the fishers of men, that cast
the net of the Gospel into the sea of the world to take up souls, look
henceforward that they blood not their net with cruel persecutions and
slaughter of Gods servants. In the building of the material Temple there was
heard no noise of any iron tool, to show, that in stirs and broils there is
no building of Gods house. As King-fishers breed in a calm sea, so the Church
exceedingly multiplyeth in the days of peace, which long may we enjoy under
our Solomon, who deserves as well the title of Preserver of the Peace, as
Defender of the Faith of the Church. For what does he not, to take up quarrels,
and compose differences in all reformed Churches? wherein God has so blessed
his zealous endeavors, that as he has hindered the growth of much cockle sown
by Vorstius and Bertius in the Low Countries, so he has clean cut off two
heads of controversies lately arising one in the place of the other in France,
the former concerning the imputation of Christ's active obedience; the latter
concerning his immunity from the Law. As for his love to his Nathans, and
infinite desire of repairing the Temple, I cannot speak more than you all
conceive. What then is the cause that so good a work goes on so slowly? How
comes it to pass, that in so many places of this Land the Spouse of Christ
lies sick of a consumption, crying pitifully, Stay me with flagons, and
comfort me with apples: for I faint, I swoune, I dye? Whose fault is it, that
many hundreds of souls, for whom Christ shed his precious blood, are like to
famish and perish for the want of the bread of life, and there is none to
break it unto them? It seems strange to me, that in France and other
countries, where the poor flock of Christ Jesus is miserably fleeced and
fleaed by the Romish Clergy, yet they find means to maintain a Preacher in
every congregation, and that in diverse places of this Kingdom, where neither
the wild Bore of the forest digges at the root of ou^ Vine, nor the wild
Beast of the field browseth upon the branches thereof, there should not be
sufficient allowance no not for an insufficient Curate. Elie's zeal was none
of the hottest, yet he made no reckoning of his private loss in comparison of
the public: when he heard the messenger relate the fl^ght of Israel, and the
death of his two sons, Hophni and Phineas, he was mentis compos, and fate
quietly in his chair: but as soon as mention was made of the taking of the
Arc, he presently fell down backward, and gave up the Ghost. Dear
Christians, many living Temples of the Holy Ghost have bin lately surprised by
Papists, and yet no man takes it to heart. The Jews, as Josephus reports in
the siege of Jerusalem, though they were constrained themselves to eat Mice,
Rats, and worse Vermin, yet always brought fair and fat beasts to the Temple
for sacrifices. And Livie testifies, that when the Tribunes complained of want
of gold in the treasury to offer to Apollo, the Mations of Rome plucked off
their chains, bracelets, and rings, and freely offered them to the Priests, to
supply that defect in the service of their gods. I pray God these Painims and
Infidels be not brought in at the day of Judgment to condemn many of our
great professors, who care not how the Temple falls to decay, so their houses
stand; have no regard how God is served, so they be well attended; take no
thought though the Arc be under the curtains, so they be under a rich canopy,
or at least a sure roof: who are so far from offering to God things before
abused to pride and luxury, that they abuse to pride and luxury things by their
religious ancestors offered unto God: who with Zeba and Zalmunna having taken
the houses of God into their possession, lay out the price of blood, the price
of souls upon riotous feasting, gorgeous apparel, vain shows, Hawks,
Hounds, and worse. What sin may be compared to this, that turns those
things to maintain sin, that should convert many unto righteousness? How is
it possible that they should escape Gods vengeance, who nourish pride with
sacrilege, maintain luxury with murder, not of bodies, but of souls, whom
they and their heirs starve, by keeping back the Ministers maintenance, who
should feed them with the bread of life? What boldness is it? nay, what
presumption? what contempt of divine majesty? what abominable profaneness and
impiety to break open the doors of the Tabernacle, and rifle the Arc of the
Covenant, and rob God himself? No marvel therefore if he have showed
extraordinary judgments upon such felons, as he did upon Achan, who paid
dear for his Babylonish raiment: for it cost him all his goods, and his Judge.

who after they had robbed the Temple of Proserpina, and sailed away joyfully
with the rich prize, were driven back again with a violent tempest, and
suffered shipwreck at the shore in sight of the Temple which they spoiled: The
Mariners were all cast away, and nothing was saved but the gold and silver
which they stole out of the Temple. As he did upon Herod's servants, who
entering into the Temple of Jerusalem, and opening the sepulcher of David, to
filch away the great mass of treasure that was laid up there, were all burnt
with a fire that suddenly brake out of the chest or coffin in which the Kings
bones were enclosed. As he did upon D. Andrews conc. ad Cler. Laqueos monstro

Leo Copronimus, who entering into a Church endowed by Constantine the great
with a precious crown of gold beset with Carbuncles, had no sooner taken the
crown out of the place, and put it upon his sacrilegious head, but there arose
a Carbuncle in his temples, of which he dyed, as the Historians of that age
report; verifying the Proverb of Syracides, Quo quis peccat, eo punietur: a
Carbuncle was his sin, and a Carbuncle was his end: Capus sacrilegio pollutum
Carbunculo aduritur.

To make toward the shore, and leaving this salt discourse, to give you a
taste of sweet water in the haven. As I have made it good unto you by many
arguments and instances, that nothing is worse taken than by sacrilege from
God, so nothing is better given than by pious bounty unto God. Obed-Edom found
it in his house, the widow of Sarepta in her cruce, the Samaritane in her
child, David in his race, and Mary Magdalen in her soul. And here that
observation of Not. hist. l. 1. Multa in pretio habita sunt, tantummodo quod
templis dicata.
Pliny takes place; Many things have been highly esteemed only for this
reason, because they have been dedicated to Gods service. The giving of any
thing to God adds worth to the gift. We offer things to great personages,
because they are rare and precious; on the contrary, things are precious and
sacred, because they are given to God: not only the giver, but the gift also
gains by being given unto God. The cruce that ministered nourishment to the
Prophet, became an everlasting spring of oil: the water that cleansed the
sacrifices after the Angel troubled it, received a medicinal virtue to cure
all diseases: the Manna that was kept in a golden pot in the Arc never
corrupted: the box of ointment which Mary brake upon our Saviors head,
yields yet a fragrant smell in the Church. Plin. not. hist l. 12. c. 14. Cum
Leonidas diceret Alexandro isto modo cum deviceris thuriferas gentes

Alexander the Great, by burning frankincense frankly and liberally in the
service of God, gained by conquest the Kingdom of Arabia, where all sweet
trees grow. David's vow of building God an house, and desire to perform it,
though he accomplished not his desire, yet so endeared him to God, that he and
his sons after him to many generations fared the better for it. How much more
shall the performance of so noble a work obtain of God the performance of his
gracious promise, to build their houses, and establish their private estates,
who out of love of his ordinance, and zeal of his worship contribute liberally
to the maintenance of his service, and beautifying of his Sanctuary? Who would
not willingly fill his hand to God, who fills all things living with
plenteousnesse? Who would not willingly by pious bounty bind the Lord of the
whole world in an obligation to him, who is so good a play master, that he will
make allowance for a cup of cold Mat. 10.42.
water given to a Prophet, and keep a register of two mites that are cast into
his treasury?

Howbeit I must inform you from the Apostle, that God dwells not in Acts
17.24.
Temples made with hands, but in the hearts and minds of the faithful, who
(as living stones) being built upon the cornerstone Christ Jesus by faith, and
coupled fast together by unity and Christian charity, rise up by elevated
desires and affections to a holy and spiritual temple of the living God; and
this spiritual and inward temple far surpasses in the beauty of holiness
the outward or material. For that is holy only by denomination and relation,
this by inhesion and infusion of the graces of sanctification: that is adorned
with lights and tapers, this with the Word of God: that with rich vestments and
ornaments, this with heavenly habits and divine virtues: that when it is once
built needs only to be repaired, and when it is sufficiently repaired, needs no
more cost or labor to be bestowed upon it for a good space; this needs
continually to be built, repaired, enlarged and adorned: for to build it in the
ignorant, to repair it in the relapsed, to enlarge it in the proficient, and
beautify and adorn it in those that are perfect, is the end of our mission,
and tenor of our commission, and in a word, the whole duty of the man of God.
Wherefore, I beseech you (beloved brethren) suffer your selves to be hewne and
fitted for this building, and set in order by the line of Gods Word. Now, that
stones orderly set may make a sure building, three things are requisite: 1. Ut
inhaereant fundamento. 2. Cohaereant inter se. 3. Adhaereant tecto. First, that
they be built upon a firm foundation. Secondly, that they stick and hold fast
together. Thirdly, that they join unto, and bear up the roof.



First, you must be built and lie upon a sure foundation: no other sure 1 Cor.
3.11.
foundation can be laid, than that which is already laid, even Christ Jesus;
cleave fast to him, rely only upon him, build upon his Gospel for your
instruction, his grace for your conversion, his blood for your redemption, his
prayer for your intercession.

Secondly, Cohaerete invicem, stick fast together, be firmly united in
Christian charity, keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Unities
severed or divided make no number, letters divided make no syllable, syllables
divided make no word, words divided make no speech, members divided make no
body, stones divided make no wall. The Ark of the Church is like the ship in
controversy of law, in which two owners claimed right, of which it was said,
Eras. Adag.
Si dividas, perdis, if you cut it in two parts to satisfy both parties, you
destroy the whole.

Thirdly, Adhaerete tecto, be pinned fast unto, and support the roof. What is
the roof, but the higher Romans 13.1.
powers ordained of God? As the roof must bear off storms from the walls, so
the walls must bear up the roof; if the roof decay, the walls will soon
feel it. The Athenians in their greatest dangers were wont Eras. chil.
(...), to cast out the great ancher, which they called the holy ancher: the
chiefest Pilots and Steresmen in our State discover so great dangers, that they
command the holy ancher to be cast out; and if this ancher fasten not on your
golden sands, the great vessel, in whose bottom lies not only the safety of
the Prince, the honor of the Kingdom, but the state of sincere Religion
throughout the Christian world, is in peril of drowning; and if the great
vessel miscarry, what will become of the skiphs of every ones private estate?

Ye have heard (beloved Christians) of the material Temple to be erected and
kept in repair by you that are wealthy; and the spiritual to be built,
repaired, and adorned in you all: ye have learned how ye (as living stones)
are to be drawn to this building, fitted for it, and placed in it; yet when we
have done what we can to build you in your most holy faith, and ye have helped
and furthered the work what ye are able, except the Psalm. 127.1.
Lord build the house, their labor is but in vain that go about to build it.
Wherefore let us address our prayers to God the Master Builder, and to Jesus
Christ the foundation and chief cornerstone, to build us upon himself by
faith, and fit us for this building by obedience, and couple and join us fast
by charity, that we may continue as solid and firm stones here in the earthly,
and shine hereafter as precious stones in the heavenly Jerusalem. So be it,
heavenly Father, for the merits of thy Son, by the powerful operation of the
holy Spirit. Cui, etc.

germinent, ut patulis eorum ramiis obumbrata plebs foeliciter succrescat, and
omnes in viros in Christo perfectos adolescamus. Ita toti in lauds tuas
effundemur, qui nos e colluvie saeculi selegisti, quos immortali verbi semine
gigneres denuo, sacramentis aleres, Filii cruore ablueres, Spiritus sancti
gratia imbueres, and ad extremum coelestis gloriae corona ornares. Ac ne in via
deficeremus, and medio erumnosae vitae stadio concideremus, multa nobis and
magna vitae solatia and subsidia indulsisti, altam pacem, securam Ecclesiam,
florentem Academiam, splendidissima Collegia, bonam valetudinem, and optime
constitutas vitae rations. Quid tibi, coelestis Pater, pro hisce tuis quibus
enumerandis pares haud sumus, nedum reperiendis beneficiis rependemus? calicem
salutis accipiemus, and sanctum Nomen tuum invocabimus, ea praesertim
praecationis formula quam in Evangelio Dominus ipse dictavit: Pater noster
qures in coelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum, etc.

JOHAN. 21.15, 16, 17. 15. Quum ergo prandissent, dicit Simoni Petro Jesus,
Simon fili Jonae, diligis me plus quam hi? Dicit ei, Certe, Domine, tunosti
quod amem te. Dicit ei, Pasce agnos meos.

16. Dicit ei rursum secundo, Simon fili Jonae, diligis me? Ait illi, Certe,
Domine, tu nosti quod amem te. Dicit ei, Pasce oves meas.

17. Dicit ei tertio, Simon fili Jonae, amas me? Tristitia fuit affectus
Petrus, quod tertio dixisset ipsi, Amas me? Dixitque ei, Domine, tu omnia
nosti, tu nosti quod amem te. Dicit ei Jesus, Pasce oves meas.


QUod de tribus in coelo testibus Johannes, idem de tribus hisce versibus
liceat usurpare, 1 Johan. 5.7.
Hi tres unum sunt. Etenim sacro huic contextuitrina intexitur interrogatio,
quae tamen unica est, Amas me? and trinae interrogationi triplex redditur
responsum, quod tamen unicum est, tu nosti quod amem te: and triplici responso
triplex additur mandatum, quod tamen unicum est, Pasce oves meas. Ter repetita
interrogatio, summam examinandi diligentiam; ter accommodata Petri responsio,
summum amandi desiderium; ter inculcatum Petro mandatum, summam pascendi
necessitatem indicat, and Pastorum omnium mentibus intimis infigit. Enim vero,
Not. hist. l. 22 de med. herb. c. 21. Magi Heliotropium in Tertian^s ter
alligari jubent ab ipso aegro.
quemadmodum Heliotropium non nisi ter alligatum corpori tertianae febri
mederi, ex Magorum doctrina refert Plinius; ita plane Augustinus, Cyrillus, and
interpretum recentiorum facile princeps Calvinus, conjiciunt gravissimam illam
plagam, quam sibi Petrus, and dignitati Apostolicae trina negatione inflixerat,
non alia potuisse, quam trinae confessionis medicina sanari. Hinc est quod
Petrus tertianae suae qua in domo Pontificis cohorruerat, quasi ter
heliotropium applicans, ter ad solemn justitiae se convertit; and quoties
negavit se Dominum scire, toties affirmat Dominum scire, quod ipse eum ex
intimis animi sensibus and medullis amet. Ita nimirum loci hujus rationem
subducit Tract. in Johan. 123.
Augustinus, Redditur trinae negationi trina confessio, ne minus amori lingua
serviat quam timori. Quam ut ab eo confessionem Christus eliceret, and
pristinae eum dignitati restitueret, ter animum fodit amoris aculeo, amas me?
iterum, amas me? etiam tertio, amas me? Amas me propter te? amas me propter me?
amas me supra te? Prorsus ut maritus sponsam suam quam toto orb chariorem
habet, derelicturus solet affari, amas me? curam suscipe parvulorum meorum: ita
Christus Petrum blande compellat, Simon Jonae, amas me? pasce agnos meos, and
ter ut dixi eandem tundit incudem, ut copiosas amoris stricturas exprimeret,
quas in responsione Petri relucere conspicimus. 1 Tu nosti quod amem te amore
desiderii. 2 Tu nosti quod amem te amore amicitiae. 3 Tu nosti quod amem te
amore excellentiae.


Hisce enim tribus quasi gradibus ad summum divini amoris fastigium pervenitur.
Primo Deum propter nos ipsos diligimus, deinde a rivis bonitatis ad fontem
naturae recurrentes, ipsum propter se amamus; denique omnis pulchritudinis and
decoris florem, and perfectionis ipsius expressam imaginem in ipso
contemplantes, supra omnia ipsum, and in ipso, omnia amplectimur.

Cum omnium quae ^^^antur, judice Augustino, Lib. 11. de Civ. Dei. c. 28. Utrum
ipse amor ametur dictum est. Amatur autem, and hinc probatur, quod in omnibus
quae rectius amantur, ipse magis ametur: neque enim virbo nus merito dicitur,
qui scit quod bonum est, sed qui diligit.
amor ipse magis amandusit, equidem libenter amoris ipsius amorem aspirante
numine, in pectoribus vestris hoc tempore accendere satagerem, nisi nuperrime
in hac corona licet non hoc in loco huic flammae oleum affudissem, and totum
myrothecium exhausissem. Add quod oration Christi in amore non se sistat, quin
imo amorem ipsum gradum faciat ad solicitudinem pastoralem. Amas? pasce.
Pascis? ita demum amas. Ille in amore prior est, qui plures perduxerit ad
amorem Dei, ut site Bernardus.

Dicit ei, Simon amas me plus quam hi? Dicit ei Petrus, tu nosti quod amem te.
Quod hic in responsione Petri desideratur supplet modestia. Sciscitabatur
Christus, non de amore (...), sed de amoris ipsius ardore, affectuque
vehementiore, amas me plus quam hi? Petrus de amore timide and diffidenter
respondet, de gradu nihil omnino spondet. Piscator, nempe Petrus, ictus sapuit,
and qui primas obtinere non poterat prudentiae, secundas tenet modestiae.
Quando plus pollicitus fuerat quam caeteri, minus praestitit; ideoque quo plus
praestet, minus nunc pollicetur. Didicerat experimento se Christo notiorem quam
sibi, atque idcirco non jam amplius sua conscientia, sed Christi scientia
nititur, inquiens, tu nosti, Domine, tu omnia nosti, Apoc. 2.23.
tu renes and corda scrutaris, tu animorum latebras excutis, tu intimos hominum
sensus perspectos habes, and exploratos, nec latere te potest affectus, quem
ipse impressisti: cur ergo toties repetita interrogatione eum qui te deperit
enecas? Actum de me est, and spes omnis conclamata, si amorem meum Dominus meus
habeat su spectum. Ad haec Christus nihil refert aliud, quam pasce, pasce,
pasce. 1 Pasce mente. 2 Pasce ore. 3 Pasce opere.


Pasce animi Bern. Sermon. Pasch.
devotione, pasce verbi exhortatione, pasce exempli exhibitione.

Pasce agnos, pasce oves, pasce oves: semel ait pasce agnos, bis pasce oves,
forte, quia agni simplici lactis cibo contenti esse debeant, oves cibo
multiplici. 1 Modo solido doctrinae. 2 Modo dulci consolationis. 3 Modo amaro
reprehensionis sunt pascendi.


Nam si quis aurium delicatiorum verba tantum byssina plumeaque probet, quasi
nihil nisi rosas, quod aiunt, spirare debeamus, noscat ille apes alveos suos
amarioribus succis illinere, adversas aliarum bestiarum aviditates: and a
medicis discat nulla remedia tam facere dolorem, quam quae sunt salutaria: aut
si malit a theologis, discat virgam cum Manna, seu sacrum anathema Arcae
inclusum fuisse. Ep. 19. ad Eust
Et quoniam mel (ut observat Hieronymus) in sacrificiis Dei non offertur, nimia
dulcedo art mutata est, and quadam piperis austeritate condita. Apud Deum
nihil tantum suave placet nisi quod habet in se aliquid mordacis veritatis.
Pascha Domini cum amaris herbis erat comedendum; and omnis oblatio Christiana
sale est condienda. Hinc est quod Christus Petro mandat primo (...), tum (...)
veritate doctrinae, (...) severitate disciplinae; (...) verbo and exemplo,
(...) virga and baculo: de quibus apposite In Job. exp. mor. l. 27.
Gregorius, Virga percutimur, and baculo sustentamur: sit ergo discretio virgae
quae feriat, and consolatio baculi quae sustentet. Quos tandem? Non hircos
lascivos, non sues immundas, non lupos voraces, non pardalos maculosos, non
leones truces, non ursos saevos, non vulpes astutas, sed

Agnos and oves. Sincerum, simplex, and sine fraud pecus. Etenim Deus qui
omnibus fluviis Silunta placide and leniter fluentem, omnibus arboribus vitem
ramo, and folio, and flagellis, and fructu tenerrimis, omnibus floribus lilium
sine spinis, omnibus volucribus columbam fell carentem: idem omnibus
animalibus agnos and oves praetulit, and in peculium suum ascivit: hae namque
solae audiunt vocem ejus, Mat. 11.29.
Discite a me, quod mitis sim and humilis cord. Omnes Christi Discipuli vel
agni sunt lacte fideique rudimentis alendi, vel oves sunt ad virentia sacrae
Scripturae prata, and vivas Spiritus sancti scaturigines, ut sitim animae
restinguant, deducendae: quas quia Dominus sui sanguinis pretio acquisivit,
merito suas indigitat, ne tanquam nostras tondere, ne dum deglubere aut mactare
audeamus. Interim luculenter testatur Christus quanti faciat salutem nostram,
dum ita singulariter pastoribus eam commendet, atque hoc sibi documentum fore
asserat quantopere ab illis ametur, si eam solicit curent. Nihil certe
efficacius dici potuit ad animandos evangelii ministros, quam dum audiunt
nullum gratius officium esse, quam quod pascendo ejus gregi impenditur; piis
autem omnibus non vulgaris inde haurienda est consolatio, dum se filio Dei tam
charos esse ac pretiosos audiunt, ut eos quasi in locum suum surroget: sed
eadem doctrina non parum terroris incutere debet falsis doctoribus, Calv. in
hunc loc.
qui Ecclesiae regimen pervertunt, quia non leves Christo poenas daturi sunt,
qui se ab illis violari pronunciat.

Posui vobis ob oculos, viri, patres, and fratres in Christo dilectissimi,
praecipua doctrinae and exhortationis capita in hoc sacro contextu expressa ad
vivum, and filo aureolo intexta, quem sic deducere liceat; Simon Jonae non jam
amplius Petre, cum levissima aura, spiritu nimirum ancillae concussus, and de
tua statione dimotus fueris, number quemadmodum prae te fers, me prae omnibus in
sinu and delitiis habes? ideone te in mare projecisti, quod amoris ardorem
far non possis? ideone Johannem cursu superasti, ut amoris palmam ei
praeriperes? age itaque, ostende reipsa quantopere Dominum tuum ex animo colas:
en campum in quo excurrere amor tuus, cognoscique possit, en materiem and
segetem virtutis tuae; oves mihi sunt, pretio sanguinis constantes, prae fame
sitique jamjam moriturae: has pasce, iterum pasce, ac tertio dico pasce. 1
Pasce verbo. 2 Pasce Sacramento. 3 Pasce disciplina.


Quo turpius prolapsus es, eo alacrius resurge, and constantius me sequere
usque ad aram crucis: sic amorem promissum praestabis, dignitatem amissam
recuperabis, and trinae negationis maculam, partim triplici pascendi
diligentia, partim Martyrii patientia: partim sudore, partim cruore elues.
Atque hunc quidem exitum habuit, ut pulchre depingit Tract. 123. in Johan.
Augustinus, ille negator and amator, praesumendo elatus, negando prostratus,
flendo purgatus, confitendo probatus, patiendo coronatus: hunc invenit exitum,
ut pro ejus nomine perfecta dilectione moreretur, cum quo se moriturum perversa
festinatione promiserat: ita enim oportebat, ut prius Christus pro Petri
salute, deinde Petrus pro Christi praedicatione moreretur.

Renunciare filia Sionis, Ecce, venit tibi Rex tuus mitis and mansuetus, Mat.
21.5.
qui arundinem comminutam non confregit, Mat. 12.20.
imo in calamum aromaticum convertit, and linum fumigans non extinxit, imo
amoris igne accendit, ut lucem Evangelii toti terrarum orbi porrigeret.
Improbe, inquit ille, Eras. Adag.
Neptunum incusat, qui bis naufragium fecit: Petrus vero etiam ter fidei
professionis, famaeque naufragium fecerat: poenitentia tamen quam eleganter
vocat Hieronymus, tabulam post naufragium, sustentatus e tentationum fluctibus
enatavit, and Dominum in littore offendit prandium ei apparantem, and amice
compellantem, Petre, amas me? Frustra Judaeo spiculatori dica scribitur, quod
Christi manus violaverit: in cassum Romani militis nomen defertur, quod latus
ejus transverberarit. tu Petre Dominum tuum vulnerasti, tu confodisti, tu
perfida negatione perjurio implicita cor ipsum servatoris tui transfixisti:
audes tamen in amplexus ejus ruere? audes Dominum appellare, quem abnegasti?
salutare, quem abdicasti? invocare, quem ejurasti? Ecquis jam ad gratiam and
misericordiam sibi viam desperatione intercludet? ecquis sceleribus ingemiscens
Deum fore placabilem and propitium diffidet? Cum videat Petram scandali, and
lapidem offensionis in gemmam mutatum, and inter pretiosos illos lapides,
quibus superna Civitas Apoc. 21.19
inaedificata est, refulgentem.

Discamus, patres and fratres, hoc Domini nostri exemplo conservis nostris,
etiamsi animos nostros exulceraverint, ignoscere, poenasque etiam debitas
remittere in tempore. Perperam Arist. rhet. l. 2. (...).
Aristoteles summa in laud ponit vindictae studium, quasi justitiae and
fortitudinis prolem communem. Christus enim qui via est and veritas, consulit
reditum in gratiam cum adversario, dum sumus in via, utut justas offensionis
causas praebuerit, iraeque fomitem copiosum subministraverit: nec enim convenit
cum ipse Dominus peccata nostra digito scripserit in pulvere, Johan. 8.6. nos
conservorum injurias marmori insculpere, idque stilo adamantino, ad diuturnam,
si non aeternam (...). Quod si Divin. instit. l. 6. c. 18.
Lactantio fides, non minus mali est injuriam refer, quam infer: nam si
provocatrix improbitas impatientiam sibi comparem nacta fuerit, tanquam perfusa
oleo flamma tantum excitabit incendium, ut id non flumen aliquod, sed effusio
cruoris extinguiat. Absit ab uniuscujusque nostrum cogitatione, ore, auribus
illa Lamechi vox sanguinaria, Si Genesis 4.24.
Cainus septies vindicandus Lamechus septuagies septies tanto: certe enim
toties ad numerum jubet Mat. 18.22.
Christus injurias condonari; ac si rem ad calculos revocasset, a cujus
doctrina and vita absunt illi longissime quos juvant tragicae and cruentae
vindictae, I Lictor, colliga manus, caput obnubito, infelici arbore suspendito?
ubi sunt illi qui ambitioni meae, and avaritiae, juris, and statutorum repagula
opposuerunt? in jus vocate, crimina confingite, indicta causa damnate, etiam in
absentes saevite, expellite, ejicite, exterminate: Meminerit lector haec dicta
cum in C. C. C. post mortem D. Spenseri omnia susque deque verterentur,
doctissimi socii, optime de collegio meriti, vi adversae factionis a collegio
amoverentur, quos tamen postea rebus compositis Episcopus Wintoniensis in
integrum restituit.
Ut desint vires, tamen est laudanda voluntas.

Caveant interim moneo, ne in nervum erumpat istaec fortitudo, and anseres apud
Plinium refer videantur, qui apprehensa radice morsu saepe conantes avellere,
ante colla sua abrumpunt. Pessime sibi and posteris suis consuluit Tarquinius
ille superbus (qui postea exactus est) summa papaverum capita decutiendo:
debuit potius ex Apollonii Tyanei sententia infimas noxiarum herbarum radices
evellere. Haeccine illa lenitas and mansuetudo est, quam Christus Dominus
tacendo docuit, cum velut ovis mactationi destinata, and velut agnus coram Esa.
53.7. Heb. 10.30. Romans 12.19.
tonsore os non aperuit?

Sed non ero diutius (quod aiunt) unguis in hoc ulcere animorum, cui suaderem
ex Tertulliani and Cyp. ser. 3. de bon. Patient.
Cypriani praescriptionibus illud emplastrum adhiberi, Vindicta mea est, ego
rependam, dicit Dominus. Idoneus potentiae nostrae sequestor Deus est, hunc
expectemus, patres and fratres, judicem and vindicem Ecclesiae suae populum,
and ab initio mundi justorum omnium numerum secum paritur vindicaturum. Qui ad
vindictam suam nimium properat and festinat, consideret, quia nec dum
vindicatus est ipse qui vindicat.

Caeterum quoniam ex hoc loco potissimum Pontificii culmen Papatus nituntur
adstruere, quo Babylonicam illam turrem ab imis subruam fundamentis, ostendam
primo summam potestatem Ecclesiasticam Petro his verbis non fuisse demandatam,
proinde non exercuisse; deinde non exercuisse, proinde nec Christum hoc loco ei
demandasse. Nempe ut ilex tonsa bipennibus ab ipso ducit opes animumque ferro;
Horat.
ita veritas catholicae fidei ab ipsis adversariorum telis vires sumit ad istum
modum. Fatentur Papicolae omnes Pontificiam cathedram aut hic a Christo
stabiliri, aut nusquam: summa enim omnium argumentorum huc redit. Itaque si
hunc locum de quo serio triumphant, in quo omnia causae suae praesidia
constituunt, e manibus eorum extorsero; cedant, and in gravissima and plane
suprema de principatu Pontificis controversia herbam porrigant necesse est. Age
itaque, singulas contextus circumstantias, singulas voculas and literarum
tendiculas excutiamus, ex quibus nescio quibus fidiculis elicitur Papatus.
Jesus dixit Simoni, ergo soli Simoni? pasce, ergo regio more impera? oves meas,
ergo universam Ecclesiam in toto terrarum orb propagatam? Hic quia ut site
Hieronymus, quod sine Scripturae authoritate, addo and recta ratiotianatione
affertur, pari facilitate rejicitur, qua asseritur eo inficias primum soli
Petro fuisse praeceptum, Pasce: ad hoc ipsum enim pascendi mandatum sancti
Patres (ut infra ostendam) illa Domini verba accommodant, Quod uni dico,
omnibus dico. Secundo, pernego pascendi praeceptum vel innuere dominandi
potestatem: Petrus ipse sententiam ex his verbis plane repugnantem expiscatus
est, 1 Pet. 5.3.
pascite gregem Domini, non dominantes clero. Ac si rem penitius introspiciamus
pabulum subministrare, quae vis est vocis (...); potius ad servi officium
spectat, quam Domini potestatem. Nec aliud voce (...) quam (...) denotatur: nam
quo argumento Augustinus concludit, (...) and (...) idem sonare, quod in
repetenda eadem interrogatione Dominus, modo unam, modo alteram vocem assumat,
eodem convincam verbum (...) and (...) eodem recidere, quod nimirum in ejusdem
mandati inculcatione Christus modo hoc modo illud vocabulum (...) usurpet.
Idcirco Syrica, vetus and vulgata versio latina in tribus hisce versiculis
trinum Christi mandatum iisdem verbis effert. Quin and nostra quoque Anglicana
editio (...) eandem vocem ubique retinet, nec est sane quod mutet. Nam (...),
si Etymon spectes, quid est aliud quam (...) si usum, communi pastorum officio
designando adhibetur, 1 Pet. 5.2.
cujus duo munia in sacra pagina distinguntur, alterum pascendi doctrina, Act.
2.28.
alterum disciplina regendi: regendi vero pedo pastorali, non sceptro regali.
Quantumvis enim Homerus Agamemnonem belli ducem (...), appellitet, and Deus
ipse Cyrum Persarum principem Esa. 44.28.
pastorem suum nuncupet, cujus rationem luculentam Cyrus ipse apud Xen. cyr.
paed. l. 8. (...).
Xenophontem reddere videtur: nunquam tamen sacra Scriptura aut Patres quod
sciam magistratum civilem pastoris ovium Christi titulo insigniunt: non sunt
certe synonima pastor populi, and pastor ovium Christi, nedum pastor ovium, and
aspectabilis Ecclesiae monarcha; cui unquam principi Christiano Christus in
mandatis dedit, pasce oves meas? cum ipsi pastores populi, oves sint Christi
pastoris and pastorum Christi quod veteres Augusti probe intellexerunt dum ad
Christi altar sine diademate, sine satellitibus, sine caeteris magistratus
infulis accederent, significantes (ut pie notat Lib. de libert. eccles.
Caussobonus) intra Ecclesiae septum se quoque oves esse, solumque Christum
potestatem habere.

Tertio, nunquam efficient adversarii pronomen meas ad omnes in universum
Christi oves necessario extendi. Habeo Johan. 10.16.
oves, inquit Christus, quae non sunt ex hac caula, puta Judaica, oves illae
erant Christi oves, non tamen omnes Christi oves sed ovilis pars aliquota.
Ecquis vero animum induxerit suum, omnes Christi oves ab unius mortalis anima
pendere, Christumve omnium ovium ab initio promulgati Evangelii pereuntium
sanguinem repetiturum a Petro? cui quidem oves suas indefinite, aut si malint
quaslibet communiter comendavit, ut Apostolo, nulli certo gregi addicto: non
omnes universe ut pastori oecumenico. Cur ergo Petrum Dominus seorsim
alloquitur? eique nominatim, idque ter praecipit, Pasce? Respondent antiqui
patres, non ut triplicem ei coronam contexeret, sed ut triplicis negationis
memoriam ei refricaret: non ut monarchiam quam fingunt adversarii Mat. 16.18.
promissam in persona ejus institueret, sed ut Apostolatus dignitatem amissam
restitueret trina professio, and triplex interrogatio, and ter repetitum
mandatum infirmitatis Petri subsidia erant, non potestatis argumenta. Sed enim
acriter instat Bellarminus, multisque argumentis contendit, Christum his verbis
Petrum eumque solum esse alloquutum, quem Simonem Jonae appellat, cui trinam
negationem occulte exprobrat, quem in pristinum gradum reducit, eique martyrii
coronam offert verbis sequentibus, Cum senueris alius te cinget, etc. Damus
haec omnia, Bellarmine, sine causae dispendio. Quid enim si Christus Petrum
seorsim and singulariter compellavit? exinde inferes Ecclesiae principem
renunciasse, aut pascendi munus Petro soli impositum? aut ad eum solum verba
Christi pertinuisse? Perpende hoc argumentum tuum, and nihil habere ponderis
comperies. Quis enim ferret sic argumentantem? Petrus Simonem Magum nominatim
perstringit, inquiens, Fili Diaboli, plene omni dolo and malitia, pecunia tua
tecum pereat: ergo Petri verba ad eos nihil pertinent, qui in curia Romana
hamo, ut dicitur, aureo piscantur: vel sic, Paulus Timotheum adjurat, O
Timothee, serva depositum, hoc est, Catholicae fidei talentum, Interpret
Vincentio Lirinensi; ergo fidei talentum soli Timotheo concreditum est?
Christus Angelo Ecclesiae Smyrnensis sic scribit, Apoc. 2.10.
Esto fidelis usque ad mortem, and tibi dabo coronam vitae; and Angelo
Ephesino, Apoc. 2.5.
Memento unde excideris, and resipisce; and Angelo Laodiceno, Apoc. 3.18.
Eme a me aurum igne probatum, ut ditescas; and integumentum, ut vestiaris; and
collyrium, ut videas: ergone recipiscentia, constantia, fides, zelus, unctio
Spiritus, ipsaque adeo Christi imputata justitia non sunt omnium christianarum
mentium ornamenta? Hic non animadvertit argutulus sophista se messes (quod
aiunt) suas urere. Nam si hoc pascendi praeceptum, ut ipse contendit, ad eum
solum spectat, qui a Jona oriundus, ter Christum ivit inficias, and trinam
negationem trina prius confessione, postea and sanguine expiavit; nihil hic
Paulo quinto seritur, aut metitur; nihil ei oneris imponitur, aut muneris
mandatur; ad eum haec verba non omnino spectant: non est enim a Jona credo
oriundus, nec ter (opinor) statuit Dominum negare, nec dibaphum pontificium
sanguine unquam tinget suo, nec de morte crucis (quam forte mereri poterit)
unquam cogitat. Hic si occurrat Bellarminus, utut Petrum solum Christus affatus
sit, pascendi tamen mandatum ad alios non minus quam Petrum pertinuisse. Recte
quidem argumenti mei nodum solverit; sed and sui quem ita constrinxerat.
Christus soli Petro dixit, Pasce oves, pasce agnos; illum ergo solum constituit
Pastorem oecumenicum. Luxat nervos and artus hujusce argumenti Lib. de Agon.

pasce oves meas. Luxat Ambrosius, qui se scribit, and omnes Episcopos non minus

Bellarminus, dum acurate distinguit ea quae dicuntur Petro, e quibus quaedam
(inquit) dicuntur pro se tantum, quaedam pro se and omnibus Christianis,
quaedam pro se and successoribus; id quod evidenter colligitur ex ratione
diversa qua ei dicuntur: nam quae dicuntur ei, ut uni ex fidelibus, certe
omnibus fidelibus dicta intelliguntur, ut Mat. 18. Si peccaverit in te frater
tuus, etc. quae dicuntur ei ratione aliqua propria personae ipsius, ei
solidicuntur, ut vade post me Satana, and ter me negabis: ista enim dicuntur ei
ratione propriae imbecillitatis and ignorantiae; quaedam denique dicuntur ei
ratione officii pastoralis, quae proinde dicta intelliguntur omnibus
Pastoribus, ut, pasce oves meas, and conversus confirma fratres.

Ostendi vobis (patres and fratres in Christo venerandi) supremam potestate^
non fuisse Petro his verbis tradita^, unde infero, nec habuisse, idque ex ore
adversarioru^, qui hoc in loco ponunt fere omnes Romani Pontificis fortunas:
nunc inverso argumento demonstrabo Petru^ hanc potestate^ nunqua^ exercuisse;
unde facile est colligere, nunquam ei a Christo fuisse delegatam, quod ut (...)
evincam, edisseram. 1 Petrum non fuisse Apostolorum collegio praefectum. 2 Utut
praefectus fuerit, non fuisse toti Ecclesiae praepositum. 3 Utut praepositus
fuerit, hunc honorem ad successorem non fuisse delatum. 4 Utut delatus fuerit
Pontificem Romanum hunc sibi vindicare non potuisse. 5 Utut vindicare
potuisset, cum 700. a Christo nato annis non obtinuerit, nunc obtinere non
posse: hisce quasi gradibus a fastigio turris Babylonicae ad fundamentum
evertendum, descendam.


Ac primo gradui summo insistam, and ipsum apicem sic adorior. Si nihil Petro
promissum fuit, Mat. 16.19. nihil commissum, Johan. 21.16. quod non caeteris
omnibus Apostolis pariter promissum, Mat. 18.18. and reipsa praestitum
collatumque, Johan. 20.22, 23. diplomate illo, Sicut misit me Pater, ita mitto
vos; quorum peccata remiseritis, remissa sunt; quorum peccata retinueritis,
retenta sunt. Si (ut Jacobum fratrem Domini, and dilectum Discipulum qui in
sinu Jesu recubuerat, contentionis invidia liberem) B. Paulus nulla in re Petro
cessit, fascesve submisit; si nihil illi caeterisque (...), acceptum tulit,
praeterquam tesseram amicitiae, and Gal. 2.9.
dextram societatis; si in sortitione, ut ita loquor, provinciarum

ampliorem and honestiorem quam Petrus ipse consecutus est, certe Petrus in
sublimem dignitatis gradum super omnes Apostolos non fuit evectus. Atqui nihil
Petro potestatis, Mat. 16. promissum est, quod caeteris Apostolis, Mat. 18. and
Johan. 20. non est praestitum, and reipsa collatum, ut ex Hilario, Hieronymo,
Augustino, aliisque patribus liquido deducit L. 1. de Romans Pont. c. 12.

Cyprianus, cujus sunt haec verba disertissima, Christus post resurrectionem
Apostolis omnibus parem potestatem tribuit. Hoc utique erant caeteri Apostoli
quod Petrus, pari consortio praediti, and honoris, and potestatis. Ubi
observatu dignissima est beati Martyris accurata diligentia, cui non
satisfuerat semel asserere id fuisse caeteros quod Petrum, nisi id ipsum
diserte explicuisset, addito primum consortii vocabulo: and quia potest
aliquando aliqua consortii species esse inter impares, expressit par
consortium, ne reliquos intelligeres subsistere in gradu aliquo inferiore.
Denique, qua in re constitueret illam paritatem, testatum voluit pari
consortio, inquit, honoris and potestatis; quid ergo fiet Petri principatui?
quo loco consistet? quibus Christi verbis nitetur? Si in medium proferant
adversarii verba illa Christi apud Matthaeum, Super hanc petram aedificabo
Ecclesiam meam, ut Petrum Ecclesiae fundamentum statuant, referam ex Ephesians.

Comment. in Gal. 2. (...).
Oecumenius a curate observans, ait, Ecce quemadmodum se Petro exaequet: quid
enim aliud sonant ipsissima Apostoli verba, Nihilo arbitrorme inferiorem
praecipuis Apostolis; and iterum confidentius, 2 Cor. 11.5. and 12.11.
Nihilo sum inferior, seu nulla in re cedo summis Apostolis? Hoc ait (inquit
Ambrosius) Quia minor non est, neque in praedicatione, neque in signis edendis,
neque dignitate, sed tempore. Quin and ipse Leo in not. Pet. and Paul.
Leo pontifex, qui si quispiam alius authoritatis pontificiae fimbrias
dilatavit, omnia tamen in Petro and Paulo paria esse agnoscit, and ita paria,
ut neque hic dignitate vinci potuerit, neque illum dignitate superaverit: De
quorum meritis and virtutibus (inquit) quae omn^^ superant loquendi facultatem
nihil diversum, nihil sentire debemus discretum, quia illos and electio pares,
and labor similes and mors fecit aequales.

Non fuit igitur Petrus Apostolici collegii praeses: fuerit, non tamen continuo
universae Ecclesiae administrandae cura uni incubuit. Aliud est Apostolorum
caetui, aliud universo Christi gregi; aliud urbi, aliud orbi praeesse: aliud
duorum scalmorum navigii in sinu Adriatico, aliud Argonavis, seu potius
universae classis Dominicae in ocaeano cursum moderari. Nunquid quia unus
agricola uni agello colendo sufficit, torus perinde terrarum orbis erit uni
vilico demittendus? nunquam profecto adversarii ex eo quod Petrus inter
Apostolos eminuit, efficient totius Ecclesiae gubernacula ei fuisse tradita.
Nec enim Christus ipse qui per vicariam, ut appellat Tertullianus, vim spiritus
Ecclesiae perpetuo adest Episcoporum consiliis prae est, Ministrorum vocationi,
verbi praedicationi, and sacramentorum administrationi interest, and omnia
pastoris munia ad amussim praestat expletque, caret vicario. Nec si careret
mortalium quisquam tanto muneri par esset sustinendo, ut in singulis Christi
caulis perpetuo ageret, and universas Christi oves toto terrarum orb dispersas
unus pasceret. Nec si quisquam huic oneri esset ferendo, ex usu foret
Ecclesiae, ut ab extimis mundi oris and plagis remotissimis totus Christi grex
ad unum confugeret, in negotio salutis and causa fidei ab uno penderet, qui
saepe incertus, semper majori diaeceseos parti absens, non raro veritatis
adversarius, and Ecclesiae perduellis extitit, ne dicam eum propria vi vocis
(...) pro Christo, seu vice Christi, ut apud Hom. (...) vicedeus, seu Deo
similis, Il. 2.
Antichristum censendum, qui se in Ecclesia pro Christo venditat, Christi
ipsius locum arrogat, and omnes titulos capitis, fundamenti, sponsi Ecclesiae,
universalis episcopi usurpat: a quo nomine tanquam profano, sacrilego,
blasphemo, Antichristiano, Luciferiano semper abhorruit Gregorius Greg. epist.
32, 78, 80, 82, 83.
magnus, qui bonorum pontificum agmen clausit. Nec turpissimam Antichristinotam
pontificia pontifice inustam Bellar. de Romans Pontif. l. 2. c. 31.
Bellarminus unquam eluet distinctione sua nimium diluta Episcopi universalis,
qui ita dicitur (inquit) vel ut intelligatur esse solus Episcopus omnium
christianarum urbium, ita ut caeteri non sint Episcopi, sed illius tantum vi
^^rii: and hoc sensu nomen hoc Gregorio profanum, sacrilegum, antichristianum
visum est; vel dicitur universalis Episcopus qui generalem habet curam totius
Ecclesiae, ita ut non excludat particulares Episcopos, and hoc sensu Gregorio
ipsi arrisit titulus universalis. Siccine vero Bellarmine? si haec responsio
tua Gregorio arrisit, ridendus est certe ipse Gregorius, qui tantopere exarsit
in Johannem Constantinopolitanum, non quod omnes Episcopos sua dignitate
spoliare, sed quod novo and inusitato titulo novam in Episcopos omnes
authoritatem sibi vindicare videretur. Audiamus ipsum Greg. ep. 82.
Gregorium ira inflammatum, verborum fulmina in Patriarcham
Constantinopolitanum conjicientem. Si Paulus Ep. 82.
membra dominici corporis certis extra Christum capitibus, and ipsis quidem
Apostolis subjici particulariter evitavit, tu quid Christo universalis scilicet
Ecclesiae capiti in extremi judicii es dicturus examine, qui cuncta ejus membra
tibimet conaris universalis appellatione supponere? Quis rogo in hoc tam
perverso vocabulo, nisi ille ad imitandum, proponitur, qui despectis Angelorum
legionibus secum socialiter constitutis, ad culmen conatus est singularitatis
erumpere, ut and nulli subesse, and solus videretur omnibus praeesse? Et alibi
in eundem, Quia juxta est ille de quo scriptum est, ipse est rex superbiae,
super universos filios superbiae, quod non sine gravi dolor dicere compellor,
frater and co-episcopus noster Johannes mandata dominica, Apostolica praecepta,
regulas pacis despiciens, eum per elationem praecurrere conatur in nomine ex eo
in quo sedebat cinere, ex ea quam praetendebat humilitate jactantiam sumpsit,
ita ut universa sibi tentet ascribere, and omnia quae soli uni capiti cohaerent
Christo per elationem pompatici sermonis, ejusdem Christi sibi studeat membra
subjugare. Haec and similia in epistolis passim Gregorius quae authoritati
pontificiae securim injiciunt, quam cote dialectica sic exacuo. Quicunque
universalis Episcopi nomen usurpat, cuncta Christi membra, quae soli uni capiti
cohaerent Christo, conatur sibi supponere, and subjugare, and ad culmen
singularitatis erumpere, ut and nulli subesse, and solus velit omnibus
praeesse: is est Luciferi discipulus, Antichristi prodromus (si Gregorio fides.)

At Pontifex Romanus jamdiu nomen universalis Episcopi usurpavit, and indies
conatur universa Christi membra sibi supponere, and ad culmen singularitatis
jamdudum erupit, ut and nulli subesse, and solus velit omnibus praeesse.

Ergo Pontifex Romanus calculo Gregorii damnatur, and ad inferos cum Lucifero
and Antichristo amandatur.



Cum hunc nodum Gordianum (Gregorianum dicerem) solverint adversarii, duriorem
iis adhuc provinciam imponam, ut argumento aliquo solido confirment, dignitatis
Petri praerogativam ad omnes successores quales tandem cunque fuerint, jure
veluti haereditario pertinere, quasi Christus principatus si quis tandem, sit,
seu primatus potius in Ecclesia fundanda honorem non Petri personae and fidei,
sed sedi and loco detulisset, cum jam Petrus nusquam cathedram collocasset.
Certe verba illa, Et ego etiam tibi dico, Petre, tu es Petrus, etc. ad Petri
professionem aperte recipient, and hunc sensum prae se ferunt: Tu me, Petre,
omnium primo coeli haeredem, and Ecclesiae caput professus es: ego itidem tibi
profiteor me tibi primum claves* regni coelorum in manus daturum, teque intra
Ecclesiae fundamenta seu lapidem pretiosum in primo ordine positurum. Quem
honorem Petri successor, ideo sibi nequit arrogare, quia Petrus sibi aeternum
retinet: non secus ac Abrahamo patri fidelium, and Patriarchis in vet. Test.
qui duodecim stellis in Apoc. 1^.1.
Apocalypsi assimilantur; duodecim quoque Apostolis suus in coelo honos
illibatus reservatur, ibi enim tanquam gemmae in Apoc. 21.19.
fundamento muri sanctae urbis collucent, and inter eas Petrus tanquam Jaspis
primo loco conspicitur. Si haec pontificiis ratio minus allubescat, assignent
ipsi rationem cur Petro soli succedatur in honor, non ite^ reliquis? seu
potius cur Petro ipsi in principatu succedatur, non in Apostolatu: si
Apostolatus in exemplum trahi nequit, nedum principatus ille quem fingunt
Apostolorum? ut hoc peracutum Junii telum frustrentur, nunquam tamen
Tertulliani interrogationi satisfacient. Si quia Petro dixerat Dominus, Tertul.
lib. de pudicit. c. 21.
Super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam, and quodcunque ligaveris in
terra, erit ligatum in coelo; idcirco praesumis ad te derivasse hanc solvendi
and ligandi potestatem, qualis tu es evertens and commutans manifestam Domini
intentionem personaliter hoc Petro conferentis. Quod si praerogativa Petri
dignitas ex Christi institutione personalis fuerat, successio loci hic locum
non habet. Etenim episcopatus Petri ut omnium Apostolorum (...), nullis loci
cancellis erat circumscriptus, nedum rupi Tarpeiae affixus. Add, quod si ideo
Romano Episcopo primae deferendae sint, quia Petri audit successor,
Hierosolomytanus and Ephesinus Patriarchae, qui Johanni and Jacobo
successerunt, saltem in secundis tertiisve consisterent: at secundum locum
semper tenuit Alexandrinus, tertium Antiochenus, ultimum Hierosolomytanus,
Ephesinus ne in extremo quidem angulo haesit. Quis vero adducatur ut credat
Petro mortuo Linum Petri ut fertur successorem ad clavum totius orbis
Christiani sedisse, Johanne praesertim Apostolo and Marco Evangelista
superstitibus? haec clarissima Ecclesiae lumina Lino nescio cui tanquam capiti
subjicere cujus tandem fuerit ignorantiae, ne dicam stultitiae?

Sed largiamur adversariis quod nunquam vi rationis, aut Scripturae authoritate
evincent, dignitatem Petri successoribus in universum omnibus co^municatam, and
certae etiam cathedrae implicitam and annexam: ne sic tamen Ecclesia Romana
obtinebit principatum. Interveniet Antiochena, and eam ex jure manu consertam
vocabit, quod temere in ipsius possessiones and privilegia invaserit: satis
enim ex ipsis sacris literis constare Ecclesiam Antiochenam primam Christi fide
imbutam, and Christianae titulo insignitam: in ea Petrum Apostolorum principem
cathedram collocasse, ex Hom. 3. ad pop. Antioch.
Chrysostomo eam Christo charissimam, omniumque civitatum sub orient
principem: ex Ep. 48.
Basilio inde tanquam ex capite in totum Ecclesiae corpus sanitatem derivari,
demum ex Matthaeo Parisiensi suum antistitem in Pontificem ipsum Romanum sub
annum 1238. excommunicationis gladium strinxisse, quid hic comminiscuntur
Romanenses? Petrum cathedram pontificalem ab Antiochia Romam transtulisse
ibique (credo Dei Termini opera) qui nulli cedit, immotam fixisse. Non ergo jam
verbis Christi, sed facto Petri nititur Papatus. Esto, factum hoc Petri ubi
scriptis consignatur? quo test probatur? Non in tabulas profecto sacras
refertur, nec publicas. Apocryphi quidam authors aliquid memoriae produnt,
quorum in multis fides laborat: nec hi tamen asserunt Petrum Romae cathedram
statuminasse, nedum immobiliter, minime omnium jure divino. Narrant tantum
Petrum Antiochiae Romam migrasse, ibique martyrii corona redimitum. Palmarium
plane argumentum: Petrus Romae cruci suffixus est; ergo fixit ibi cathedram
pontificiam. An non Christus ipse Hierosolymae fuit in crucem sublatus, and
primatus honorem loco Christus morte sua acquirere non potuit, Petrus potuit?
Ista ratione probarem cathedram summi pontificatus in deserto statuendam, quod
ibi summus pontifex Aaron stolam pontificiam exuens expiraverit. En quo tandem
recidit res: fides pontificia Ecclesiae, Ecclesia pontificis Romani cathedra,
cathedra Romani pontificis Petri successione, Petri demum successio tenuissima
conjectura ex narratione authorum fidei dubiae ducta nititur. De qua
Bellarminus ipse timide and diffidenter loquitur, Cum Petrus, Lib. 2. de Romans
Pontif. c. 12.
Domino jubente, Romam venerit, and ibi martyrium pertulerit, non improbabile
est Dominum jussisse ut Romae sedem figeret, and Romanus pontifex ei absolute
succederet, and si fortasse non est de jure divino Romanum pontificem, qua
Romanus pontifex est succedere in praefectura totius Ecclesiae: ergone quod non
est improbabile, quod forte est, forte non est, de fide est? imo fidei
catholicae basis substernitur and fundamentum?

Satis mihi videor quatuor columnas, quibus fabrica papatus incumbit,
convellisse and labefactasse: quintum restat ut aggrediar, quam cum nube
testium, and procella rationum and exemplorum obruero, magnae Babylonis necesse
erit, Ut collapsa ruant subductis tecta columnis. Petrus caeteris Apostolis
dignitate and honor non praeluxit, praeluxerit: summa tamen potestas
Ecclesiastica penes ipsum non resedit, resederit; haec potestas ad successores
non fuit derivata, derivata fuerit; cathedrae Romanae non fuit alligata, fuerit
alligata; tamen cum tot pontifices qui Romae nascente, and adulta Ecclesia
sederunt, hanc aut sibi non vindicaverint, aut si vindicaverint, non
obtinuerint, post tantum temporis intervallum non poterit jam pontifex jus suum
(si unquam suum, quod inficiamur) velut postliminio recuperare.

Age itaque, annals replicemus, and ex his potissimum hanc litem dirimamus
hunc in modum.

1 Quem antiqui Episcopi purioribus temporibus a fastu seculi remotioribus,
modo fratrem, modo collegam, modo consodalem, Vid. Cypr. ep. 1. ad Jubaian.
modo Romae Sacerdotem, and urbis Episcopum salutarunt, aliquando etiam libere
and acerbe increparunt: ad quem, test Ep. 288. Ante Concilium Nicenum quisquis
sibi vivebat, and ad Romanum Pontificem parvus habebatur respectus.
Aenea, sylvio ante Concilium Nicenum parvus habebatur respectus, ut
contentiones illae quae gliscebant inter Gal. 2.11.
Paulum and Petrum, Hieron. Catal. vir. il^ust.
Policarpum and Amicetum, Polycratem and Victorem, Cyprianum and Stephanum,
argumento sunt: cui post Concilium Nicenum, decreto generalium Conciliorum
patriarcha Constantinopolitanus in omnibus etiam in ecclesiasticis exaequatus
est, is in celsissimum honoris gradum supra omnes pastores and Episcopos non
fuit constitutus.

2 Is cujus potestas and jurisdictio Romae and suburbiorum Ecclesiarum
limitibus est circumscripta, ut testatur Hist. ^ccles. l. 1. c. 5.
Ruffinus, non fuit certe pastor oecumenicus and Christi vicarius generalis.
Syn. Chalced. c. 28. Costantin. in 2. Trul. c. 36.


3 Is a quo saepe est appellatum, ad quem appellationes prohibitae sunt, qui
sibi and authoritati suae diffisus ad concilium provocavit, quod Liberium in
causa Athanasii, Innocentium in causa Chrysostomi, Leonem in causa Anatolii
fecisse legimus, non habebatur tum temporis summus causarum ecclesiasticarum
Judex.

4 Is qui in conciliis celeberrimis nec per se, nec per legatos praesedit; imo
quo invito and reluctante concilia coacta sunt, canones editi, Episcopi
confirmati and depositi, non fuit supremus Ecclesiae dictator.

5 Denique, is cujus literae repudiatae, minae spretae, sententiae rescissae,
errores notati, haereses damnatae, legati repudiati, ipse etiam cathedra
excussus, and de culmine Papali deturbatus, non fuit aspectabilis Ecclesiae
summus monarcha, illis saltem seculis quibus haec non abhaereticis, sed a
catholicis passus est. Jam vero Papatum a primis ejus jactis fundamentis toties
oppugnatum labefactatum penitus eversum, scriptis patrum, mandatis principum,
sententiis Academiarum, decretis Synodorum, Nicenae, Antiochenae, Sardicensis,
Constantinopolitanae, Chalcedonensis, Milevitanae, Carthaginensis,
Constantinopolitanae iterum and Nicenae, Constantiensis, Pisanae, Basiliensis,
communi consensu and praxi totius orbis (excipio duntaxat factionem Italicam)
luculenter ostendit Colloq. cum Harto c. 9. sect. 2. 3. 4.
Reynoldus noster in colloquio cum Harto: nec opus est in lucum ligna
conjicere. Itaque huic loco jam tandem ex Council. Carthag. edit. in op. Cypr.
359.
Cypriano colophonem addo, qui patres in concilio Carthaginensi, cui
praesidebat, sic alloquitur, Superest ut hac ipsa de re singuli quid sentiamus,
proferamus neminem judicantes, aut a jure communionis aliquem, si diversum
senserit amoventes. Nec enim quisquam nostrum episcopum se episcoporum
constituit, aut tyrannico terrore ad obsequendi necessitatem collegas adigit,
quando habeat omnis episcopus pro licentia libertatis and potestatis suae
arbitrium proprium, tanquam judicari ab alio non possit, quam nec ipse potest
alterum judicare, sed expectemus universi judicium Domini nostri Jesu Christi,
qui unus and solus habet potestatem, and praeponendi nos in Ecclesiae suae
gubernatione, and de hoc actunostro judicandi.

Abegi pro virili, Academici florentissimi, lupum Romanum ab ovili Christi:
superest ut vos omnes partim pastores ovium, partim oves pastorum, pro officii
mei and praecepti Dominici ter repetiti ratione tripliciter pascam. 1. Solido
doctrinae. 2. Dulci consolationis. 3. Amaro reprehensionis cibo.


Quandoque enim

Dulcia non ferimus, succo recreamur amaro.

Itaque praetermissis illis fidei and morum documentis quae initio praelibavi,
hunc veluti (...), and proprium hujus loci fructum vobis decerpendum offero, ut
quod a Petro Dominus, idem vos a vobis ipsis percontemini priusquam in sacrum
ordinem velitis cooptari. Pondus prius manibus librate, quam Arcam Domini in
humeros attollatis: durissimam hanc provinciam Dominus Petro non prius
imposuit, quam amorem ejus triplici interrogatione velut triplici tactu ad
lapidem Lydium, examinasset: tot enim labores verbi praeconi sunt perferendi,
tot molestiae pastori ovilis Christi exsorbendae, quas animus nisi zelo Dei
accensus, and amore Christi summo inflammatus concoquere nunquam poterit.

1 Difficile est respuere omnes voluptates, omnemque vitae cursum in labor
corporis atque animi contentione conficere: charitas tamen Christi nos cogit,
si digni pastores haberi volumus.

2 Acerbum est ab oculis fori and Curiae and Academiae conspectu jucundissimo
perpetuo, quasi exulare, and cum Prometheo veluti Caucaso affigi parochiae
rusticanae: charitas tamen Christi hoc postulat, si digni Pastores haberi
volumus.

3 Molestum est eandem semper catecheseos incudem tundere, and omnia minima
mansa panis lactisque divini infantibus in os inserere: charitas tamen Christi
hoc imperat, si digni Pastores haberi volumus.

4 Grave est severis monitis and acerbiore oratione amicorum animos exulcerare,
and maledicas linguas in nos armare: charitas tamen Christi hoc onus nobis
imponit, si digni Pastores haberi volumus.

5 Ingratum est litibus and rixis affinium and popularium se immiscere, and
Phoenicis instar dum incendium in Ecclesiae nido excitatum flabello alarm
conamur extinguere, pennas nostras saepe adurere: charitas tamen Christi hoc
saepe flagitat, si digni Pastores haberi volumus.

6 Arduum est cum haereticis, schismaticis, mundanis, voluptuariis, Atheis, and
universo Satanae exercitu manum conserere: charitas tamen Christi ad hoc faces
nobis admovet, si digni Pastores haberi volumus.

7 Permolestum est aegrotorum tempori servire, and quacunque hora diei aut
noctis in locis parum salubribus eos invisere: charitas tamen Christi hoc
exigit, si digni Pastores haberi volumus.

8 Periculosum est grassante peste aut saeviente gladio ovibus Christi nostrae
curae fideique concreditis consulere: charitas tamen Christi hoc inprimis
praecipit, si digni Pastores haberi volumus.

Hisce officii nostri partibus sigillatim enumerandis copiosior fui, ut
Theopompis nostris froenum injicerem in sanctum sanctorum irruentibus, potius
quam intrantibus: quorum praecox ministerium raro pervenit ad frugem, quippe
eorum fructus (ut observat Bernardus) quia nimis propere minus prospere se
exerunt: in quos vere liceat usurpare Quintiliani in oratorculos sui temporis
subito e terra, seu Cadmi milites exortos elogium: Quintil. inst. orat. l. 12.
c. 6. Ne praepostere distringatur immatura frons, and quicquid est adhuc
acerbum proseratur.
non bis subest vera vis, nec penitus immissis radicibus innituntur, sed ut
quae summo solo sparsa sunt semina, celerius se effundunt, and imitatae spicas
herbulae inanibus aristis ante messem flavescunt. Aarones esse cupiunt, sed
vestiendi and ornandi moram far nequeunt; in locum sanctum intrudunt potius
quam ingrediuntur, priusquam cordi sanctitas, aut pectori Urim aut Thummim
insculpantur, aut aurea linguarum tintinnabula comparaverint, aut Thoracem
Judicii optimarum artium gemmis distinxerint, aut mala virtutum granata
maturuerint, aut duos Onychas Veteris and Novi Testamenti sint humeris ferendo.
Hic quoque ubi nimium oportebat, locum habet illud Thucydidis diverbium, (...).
Hic quoque Eras. in Apoph. Ducum.
Archidamo opus est monitore, aut add viribus, aut addime animo. Ita enim
plerum que comparatum est, ut qui minime possunt, and pessime soleant hoc
sacrosancto munere defungi, froenis tamen a ministerio verbi cohibendi sint;
qui optime possunt and solent haec munia obire, calcaribus tamen incitandi
videantur. Hieronymus enim defugisse hoc onus excusatione aetatis legitur,
Moses linguam impeditam obtendisse, Paulus exclamasse, quis ad haec idoneus?
Augustinus ubertim flevisse quod intelligeret, inquit Possid. in vit. Aug.
Possidonius, quam multis periculis haec Sacerdotis functio exposita esset
atque obnoxia. Non possum de Nepotiano silere, de quo sic exclamat Hieronymus,
fit Clericus, and per solitos gradus Presbyter ordinatur. Jesu bone, quis
gemitus? Hieron. in Epitaph. Nepot.
qui ejulatus? quae cibi interdictio? quae fuga oculorum omnium? tum primum and
solum avunculo succensebat, querebatur se far non posse juvenilem aetatem
incongruum sacerdotio: sed quanto magis repugnabat, tanto magis in se omnium
studia concitabat, and merebatur negando quod essenolebat, eoque dignior eras,
quod se clamabat indignum.

Caeterum, ut officii hujus onus and amplitudo plurimum deprimit, ita dignitas
erigat animos nostros necesse est, cum serio cogitemus Christum Dominum
praetiosissimum illud depositum, pro quo animam suam posuit, oves illas pro
quibus pastor se devovit, oves pro quibus tanquam ovis est ductus ad mactandum,
illas inquam oves quas sanguine suo abluit, and auteo justitiae suae vellere
integit, nostrae curae fideique commisisse. Non poterat Christus singularis
illius amoris quo Johannem prae caeteris est complexus, luculentius specimen
edere, quam cum inter horrendos animi corporisque cruciatus jamjam expiraturus
matrem ipsi commendavit hisce verbis, Ecce matrem tuam: vobis vero etiam quam
matre non minus charam habuit dilectissimam sponsam commendatam reliquit,
vosque ejus custodes and tutores constituit. Atque ut haec cogitatio vobis
summum gaudium and laetitiam qui pastores estis, affert: ita ex eodem font non
vulgaris consolatio ovibus arcessenda est, cum subinde recolant eas Christo tam
charas esse, ut ex ipsarum cura and solicitudine amorem nostrum erga ipsum
metiatur: unde vere and severe ratiocinatur Greg. sermon. in Evang.
Gregorius, Si dilectionis testimonium est cura pastoralis, quisquis virtutibus
pollens gregem Dei renuit pascere, summum pastorem convincitur non amare. Hunc
vero Paulus gravissimi anathematis fulmine percutit, 1 Cor. 16.22.
Quisquis (inquit) non amat Dominum Jesum, sit anathemamaranatha. Omne quod
spirat, test Plinio, vocem aliquam aut sonum licet inarticulatum edit: ideo
spiritus cum fonitu veluti turbinis specie linguarum ignearum in Apostolos
illapsus est, ut disceremus eos pastores Spiritu sancto repleri, quorum linguae
sunt zelo Dei accensae, and vocis sonus tanquam turbinis templum Domini, and
fidelium aures implet. Cuiconsonant aurea Aaronis tintinnabula site pulsante
ea Vid. Greg. de cura pastoral. part. 2. c. 4.
Gregorio magno, Scriptum est, inquit, audiatur sonitus quando ingreditur, vel
egreditur sanctuarium in conspectu Domini, and non moriatur, sacerdos namque
ingrediens vel egrediens moritur si de eo sonitus non auditur, quia iram contra
se occulti judicis erigit, qui sine sonitu praedicationis incedit. Equidem ab
iis vehementer dissentio, qui eos tantum agnoscunt pastores, quibus oves unius
caulae (quam parochiam seu congregationem dictitant) septis conclusae
commendantur: eos vero five praelectores, sive doctores, sive verbi divini
ministros, qui in Academia ipsos pascunt pastores, hoc honor spoliant. Etenim
melius de Waram. Arch. Cant. apud Eras. in Ap.
republica and ecclesia meretur, qui unum medicum quam qui multos imperitos
curaverit. Add quod si hi fontes Heliconis sitiant, illorum rivi in vicis
pagisque cito arescant necesse est. Nec eos violati praecepti Dominici
insimulo, qui Hierosolymae ad tempus sanctum spiritum praestolantur in ipsos
descensurum: Hi enim conchas marinas quae margaritas concipiunt, Plin. not.
hist. l. 9. c. 35.
referunt: Hae namque ubi genitalis anni stimulaverit hora, pandunt se quasi
oscitatione, donec roscido conceptu impleantur, gravidae postea enituntur, and
pro qualitate roris hic imbibiti pariunt margaritas: quibus Sponsam Christi
mirifice ornant and illustrant. Utinam plures tales conchas haberemus: nunc
vero, ut site Bernardus, Canales multos hodie habemus in Ecclesia, conchas
paucas, tantae charitatis sunt, per quos nobis fluenta coelestia dimanant, ut
prius effundere quam infundi velint, loqui quam audire paratiores, prompti
docere quod nunquam didicerunt. Nec sane mirum est hos saepius de faece
(utaiunt) haurire, cum tam facile ubivis exiguum illud, quod plerumque non ex
ipsis fontibus coelestis doctrinae, sed aliorum puteis contritis collegerunt,
expromant. Hos tamen angustos canales, seu potius fractas cisternas aquam
continere non valentes, tubis illis aureis long capacissimis praefero, in
quibus aquae coelestes, quia meatus obturati sunt, putrescunt. Nolo in eos
aliquid acerbius statuere, quam statuit olim ipse Gregorius; Sunt nonnulli,
inquit, qui magnis muneribus ditati, dum solis contemplationis studiis
inardescunt, parere utilitati proximorum praedicatione refugiunt, secretum
quietis diligunt, secessum speculationis petunt; de quo si districte
judicentur, ex tantis procul dubio rei sunt, Greg. de cur. past.
quantis venientes ad publicum prodesse potuerunt.

Sed ut clarius adhuc perspiciatis, in quos orationis meae aculei erigantur,
(...), Pastores in quatuor genera dispertiam, aut enim ex iis sunt qui omnino
non pascunt, aut non oves, aut non Christi oves, aut noncibo idoneo. 1 Genus
eorum est, qui nec se pascunt, nec oves. 2 Eorum, qui se pascunt, non oves. 3
Eorum, qui oves pascunt, sed non Christi. 4 Eorum qui oves Christi pascunt, sed
non salubri gramine, sed cicuta, herbisque noxiis.


Hos omnes cum officii in mentem revocavero, praeceptisque and minis dominicis,
sanctionibusque Apostolicis, veluti stimulis quibusdam fodicavero, perorabo.

1 Ac primo illis litem intendo, qui nec se pascunt, nec oves; qui in agro
dominico nec cogunt, nec spargunt: sed in Academia, aut occupati infeliciter,
aut male feriati consenescunt. Ex hoc genere alii sicci sunt and sobrii, qui
abdicatis bonarum artium, and sacrarum literarum studiis, se cura rei
familiaris and negotiis secularibus fere implicant: alii factioni fovendae, and
parti cui tanquam scopulo adhaerescunt, amplificandae evehendaeque tempus
transmittunt: alii tanquam milites Mariani paludibus Minturnensibus
immerguntur, popinis dico and tabernis, in quibus non Minervae and Musis, sed
Veneri and Baccho diurna and nocturna sacra faciunt, quo cum incaluerint in
Magistratus, in privatos, in optimum quemque, in omnes ordines (horresco
referens) in religionem, in fidem, in sacram Scripturam, in Deum ipsum
despumant: ad extremum, postquam patrimonium, famam, fidem, tempus, ingenium,
omnesque animi and corporis dotes in foedissimas voluptates profuderint and
prodegerint, turpem vitam infami exitu concludunt, nescias priusne animam an
crapulam exhalent. Negat Plin. not hist. l. 8. c. 52. In Arabia suillum genus
non vivit.
Plinius sues in Arabiae purissimo aere, and suavissimis odoribus diffluente,
posse vivere. Orem stupendam and inauditam sues Arabia non capit, Paradisus
capit? Immunda animalia ae Arabicus non alit, Academicus alit? Nihil potuit
profuso nepoti in Evangelio miserius obtingere, quam utpasceret porcos, quanto
deterius cum ecclesiis Christiagitur, quas pascunt porci? quis talia fando aut
cogitando temperet a lacrymis? quis ferat, ut hi quos oportebat, seu exempla
proponi innocentiae, continentiae, temperantiae, industriae, and virtutum
omnium, monstra sint hominum, and prodigia vitiorum omnium, and in coeno
volutentur, quorum munus est animas ad coelum evehere? qui odorem vitae ad
vitam spitare debuerant, ut hi crapulam and teterrimos fumos exhalent? qui
Nectar and Ambrosiam aliis propinare, ut ii turpitudinum and flagitiorum omnium
sentinam exhauriant? Attamen ex hac hominum colluvie nonnulli ad meliorem
frugem, nec tamen bonam redeunt, subducunt se ex iis inquibus diu meruerant
castris, curiam advolant, nobili aut magnati adhaerent, and sub illius umbra
paulisper delitescunt, postea Academiam repetunt: ac ut Cic. de Harusp. resp.
Vatinias strumam suam pontificio dibapho, ita hi prioris vitae tenebras and
sordes purpura academica tegunt, and ita demum turpibus obsequiis, and artibus
(ut aiunt) simonaicis ad praefecturas and dignitatum apices ascendunt, and
Ecclesiae bona quae per scelus adepti sunt, per luxum effundunt. Aude aliquid
brevibus gyris aut carcere dignum Si vis esse aliquis.

Olim per templum virtutis recta pergebatur ad templum honoris: at ea via
jamdiu obstructa est, nec alia patet magis compendiaria, quam per aedes Junonu
Monetae. Quo tandem ore populum Israeliticum vilissimae superstitionis and
ridiculae idololatriae postulabimus, quod vitulum aureum coluerit, si docti
etiam Apuleii expatientur in lauds asini aurei? Frustra vociferamur
Sacerdotia, Prebendas and emolumenta ecclesiastica fere omnia venalia esse, si
non desint inter nos qui officia, sodalitia, praefecturas, suffragia, fidem,
religionem, jusjurandum, hastae subjiciunt. Ecquis miretur pietatis,
gravitatis, morum integritatis, prudentiae, eruditionis, and politioris
literaturae gemmas a gallis gallinaceis mundi stercorarium vertentibus, flocci
fieri, cum in hac officina doctrinae and pietatis, ab iis qui gemmarios se
profitentur, nullo in pretio habeantur? Caligulam, ferunt Benc. orat. 2.
Historici, cum seipsum divinis honoribus donasset, ne desideraret ut sacra aut
Sacerdotem ei muneri equum quem maxim dilexit praefecisse; Dignus profecto
Deus tali Sacerdote, and tali Deo Sacerdos. Nimium est quod intelligitis
Academici, itaque reprimo me; and quia primum genus eorum qui abjecta pascendi
cura, aut sordide in Ecclesia negotiantur, aut turpiter otiantur, satis mihi
videor exagitasse: venio ad illos secundo loco sugillandos, qui se pascunt, non
oves; sibi optime, ovibus pessime consulentes.

2 Ne long abeam illos noto, qui bonarum artium studiis perpetuo affixi, and
in sacrae Scripturae and sanctorum patrum lectione defixi, commentationes suas
inclusas nec lingua nec stylo in veritatis lucem proferunt. Qui si parum
deferant elogio Horatiano, Parum sepultae distat inertiae
Celata virtus.
Et forte minus Persiano scommati, -- Rupto jecore exibit caprificus.
Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter.
Non tamen possunt aut debent docti Scribae in domo Dei Icona and imaginem
Christi Domini penicillo ductam parvi pendere. Mat. 13.52.
Scriba in regno Dei doctus (inquit) est patri familiae similis, qui de
thesauro suo depromit nova and vetera, non qui in thesauro servat recondita.
Dispar siquidem and long dissimilis est nummi corradendi, and hujus thesauri
congerendi ratio: illi servando crescunt, expendendo minuuntur, hi servando
minuuntur, congeruntur dissipando, retinentur impertiendo; si parcas perdis, si
prodigas parcis, amittis si recondas, si distribuas custodis: non erunt diu tui
si sint solius tui. Itaque graviter monet Lib. 12. confess. c. 25. Veritas nec
tua, nec mea, nec illius, est, aut illius, sed omnium nostrum quos ad ejus
communionem public vocas: terribiliter admonens, ne, etc.
Augustinus, cum communis thesauris sit veritas, ut caveamus ne velimus eam
habere privatam, ne privemur ea. Legimus enim Manna in privatis vasculis,
contra Dei praeceptum in crastinum reservatum putruisse: e contra oleum e
pyxide viduae Sareptanae exhaustum continuo redundasse, non secus ac panis
miraculo creatus inter distribuendum multiplicabatur. Spartae olim laudi
dabatur, quod in ea homines optime consenescerent, at hoc ipsum maxim vitio
vertitur Academiis nostris, quod in iis doctissimi viri de maturo in vineam
Dominicam ingressu neutiquam soliciti, pessime consenescant: siquidem Academiae
sunt Ecclesiae and Reipublicae seminaria, in quibus plerunque feracissima
ingenia, ut rosae eodem horto diutius consistentes sylvescunt, aut
sterilescunt, translatione vero and ipsa plantatione proficiunt. Hierosolymae
moram 40. duntaxat dierum Christus Apostolis imperavit, Ecclesia matter
indulgentissima tot annorum commorationem in hac florentissima Academia
sacrarum literarum, studiosis etiam sacerdotio aut dignitate Ecclesiastica
auctis, quibusdam de causis indulget: quos qui superant, and ultra 50. imo and
60. annos, and ultimam usque ad senectutem, and extremum spiritum ad Verbi
ministerium, and Evangelii praeconium hic se parant, instruuntque; reliquum
est, ut apud inferos habeant conciones. Cedrorum duo genera, refert Plin. not.
hist. l. 14. c. 5. Cedri Majoris duo genera, quae floret fructum non fert,
frugifera non floret.
Plinius, unum quod floret quidem, fructum vero nullum affert; alterum quod
flore caret, fructus tamen ubertate hunc defectum quodammodo compensat:
simillima est sacerdotum and Verbi ministrorum ratio: qui festinant and sacris
quam primum ordinibus initiantur, flosculos emittunt, hoc est, ostentationis
pleni sunt, fructum vero perexiguum, aut nullum ferunt: qui e Fabio cunctatore
oriundi sunt, and sero in sacerdotum collegium se recipient, fructum quidem
nonnulli proferunt, sed specie carent and floris decore: superest igitur ut
verbi praecones futuri maturent, and praecocibus tardius cunctatoribus citius
Ecclesiastico muneri se accingant, ita fiet ut quod de patre refert Ausonius:
Auson. in Epigr.
Maturam frugem flore manente ferant.

3 Tertium genus eorum est, qui sedulo pascunt oves, sed non Christi oves, seu
ut commodius rem explicat Augustinus, qui oves Christi pascunt, sed tanquam
suas, non tanquam Christi, gloriam suam in iis pascendis quaerunt, non Christi,
emolumentum suum, non Christi. Hos Paulus perstringit, Phil. 2.21. Omnes
(inquit) quae sua sunt quaerunt, non quae sunt Jesu Christi: and acrius
insectatur, 2 Timothy 2.4, 5. Erunt homines sui amatores, pecuniae avidi,
gloriosi, superbi, maledici, ingrati, profani, charitatis expertes, etc. En
scaturiginem vitiorum impurissimam a font philautas manantem. Ne nos ergo sed
Christum amemus, and in pascendis ejus ovibus, ejus commodis non nostris
serviamus: nescio quo enim inexplicabili modo, inquit Augustinus, fi^, ut
quisquis seipsum, non Deum amat, non se amet: and quisquis Deum, non seipsum
amat, ipse vero se amet.

4 Postremum genus eorum est, qui oves Christi pascunt, sed cibo insalubri, quo
magis inficiuntur quam reficiuntur Christi oves agnique: eorum dico qui
floribus and fructibus Paradisi aut noxias herbas admiscent, aut flores
Adonidis adspergunt. Cujusmodi sunt ista dogmata, dari meritum ex congruo, ut
non ex condigno vires liberiarbitrii ab Adamo lapsu ad bonum spirituale
fractas, and debilitatas non penitus profligatas and amissas, labem originis
nemini unquam fraudi fuisse, justificationum impii non in solidum imputatae
Christi justitiae ascribendam, suas inhaerentis justitiae parts esse. Christum
morte sua nobis exemplum patientiae exhibuisse, non (...) pro peccatis
persolvisse, fiduciam salutis propriae a praesumptione parum ut nihil differ,
tutius esse a part Bellarmini quam Calvini stare; Calvinum enim blasphemias in
Christum eructare, horrorem aeternae mortis, and desperationem illi impingere
in commentariis foede hallucinari, non unquam ut ipsorum verbis utar,
Judaizare, and in multis Arrianizare, ut de reliquis notis quas alii eluerunt
nihil dicam, quid hoc sibi vult calumniae de Ar^i^nismo? nunquid Calvinus
ejusque discipuli qui in Arrianos non stylum modo sed and gladium strinxerunt,
Aristoph. in Plut.
nuper evaserunt Arriani? Site Poeta ille, aversus sycophantae morsum nullum
datur remedium: nam quantumvis ulcus curari posse videatur, manet tamen apud
nonnullos infamiae cicatrix. Attamen quaero, quibus fidiculis e Calvini dictis
aut scriptis elicient, aut Judaismum, aut Arrianismum? Calvinus (inquiunt) in
sacrae paginae sensibus investigandis fere vias a patribus tritas and
consignatas relinquit: and saepe Rabinorum; est etiam ubi Arrianorum vestigiis
insistit: Judaizat ergo, ergo Arrianizat Calvinus, mirum ni Papizet etiam:
certe enim non raro in sacrae Scripturae expositione patres deserit, and
Pontificiorum Interpretum vestigia premit. Quid hic tandem dignum virgula
censoria? Nunquamne licet in sacrorum oraculorum interpretatione a sanctis
patribus dissentire? Assentiuntur ipsi patres licere; and patribus impendio
magis addicti Pontificii Cajetanus and Andradius, hic Lectori consulit, si in
sensum aliquem incideret textui consonum, licet alio rapiat sanctoru^ patrum
torrens, non abduci, sed commodissimae interpretationi constare, ille ingenue
fatetur. Patres saepe genuinum Scripturae sensum non assequi, quem tamen
recentiores Theologi multum indagando repererunt: necesse est (inquit)
fateamur, nisi praeclarissimis ingeniis ingrati esse volumus, plurima in Mose
and Prophetis esse, nostro hoc aevo doctorum hominum diligentia multo
accuratius quam unquam antea explicata. At (inquiunt) invidiosum est sanctis
patribus refragari, and haereticis in evolvendis Scripturae sensibus
suffragari. Si hoc sit vitio vertendum, faba cudenda erit in B. Hieronymum, qui
in historia Melchizedeci illustranda quinque patrum sententias Hebraeorum
opinioni posthabuit: Augustinus itidem ejusdem criminis affinis est, qui in
Scripturae loco quodam explicando Cyprianum prius secutus, postea incidit in
aliam ejusdem loci in Tycone Donatista expositionem; quam quia veriorem
putabat, Cypriani Martyris interpretationi praetulit. Quid Hieronymum aut
Augustinum commemoro? in B. Apostolum and Christum Dominum restat ut hi
censores Calvino mastiges animadvertant, qui quasdam veteris instrumenti
sententias ad normam Pharisaeorum ita interpretantur, ut ex iis resurrectionis
doctrinam eliciant. Occurrent sat scio Christum Dominum, and B. Apostolum, and
sanctos patres Hieronymum and Augustinum praelibatas interpretationes non ideo
suo calculo comprobasse, quia a Judaeis aut Haereticis prolatae aut probatae
fuerint: sed quia verae and proinde a Spiritu sancto dictatae: agnosco and
addo, nisi livor in Genevates, aut propensior affectus in Romanenses eos
transversos ageret; idem de Calvini and Anglo-Genevensium annotationibus aut
interpretationibus a patrum orbita deflectentibus statuissent. Equidem non
arbitror quenquam eorum qui Calvinum toties convitiis proscindunt in
pontificiorum castra migrasse, illud tamen ausim affirmare, illos qui
Bellarmino aequiores sunt, quam Calvino a Papismo propius abesse, quam illum
strenuum Christi athletam ab Arrianismo. Libet ergo symbolismum retorquere, and
suis eos hastis transverberare.

1 Pontificiis solenne est quo doctrinae Protestantium conflent invidiam, omnes
ansas arripere Calvino, Bezae, aliisque reformatae Ecclesiae Doctoribus
detrahendi, detrahant hi non minus: symbolizant ergo cum pontificiis.

2 Decrevit Synodus Tridentina veterem and vulgatam editionem Latinam ab
Haebreo font (immane quantum discrepantem) omnibus versionibus praeferendam,
and in publicis lectionibus and disputationibus seu authenticam proferendam:
praeferunt hi, and proferunt in concionibus, and praelectionibus spreta
Tremeliana and quavis alia a reformatae Ecclesiae sive pastoribus, sive
professoribus elucubrata: symbolizant ergo cum pontificiis.

3 In plerisque Academiis transmarinis, in quibus obtinet Papismus, Petrus
Lumbardus, and Aquinas Neophytis in Theologia degustandi proponuntur, ut
Papismo eos penitus imbuant, proponunt hi suis discipulis privatim legendos,
and Calvinos, Zanchios, Ursinos tanquam levis armaturae milites contemptui
habent: symbolizant ergo cum pontificiis. Accedam propius, and pedem (ut
dicitur) conferam, non desunt ex his qui arctissimae amicitiae symbolum
pontificiis dant, and ab iis accipiunt, an non hi cum pontificiis symbolizant?

4 Denique si valeat illud philosophicum axioma, symbolizantia elementa sunt,
in quibus datur facilior transitus nullus dubito, ipsos citius ad pontificios,
quam Calvinum ad Arrianos defecturum: praesertim cum Calvinus and Genevenses
hanc Arrianae haeresios notam non tam atramento suo, quam sanguine Serveti
Arriani effuso eluerint. Obstrepentes videor audire quosdam huic orationi meae,
and tragice exclamantes, sustinebisne venerandis Doctoribus, aliisque
clarissimis Academiae luminibus, apud quos Calvinus tuus merito vapulat isto
modo obtrectare? quibus liceat mihi regerere an ut Hieronem refert Aelianus
antea indoctum per morbum factum doctissimum, ita quidam apud nos per morbum
animi evadunt doctissimi? siccine res habet qui ex subraucidis pontificiorum,
aut Lutheranorum adversariis centonem possunt in Calvinum, Bezam, P. Martyrem,
Piscatorem, aliosque orthodoxos contexere, ii soli Ambrosia alendi sunt;
reliquos vero ex Academia, sive doctores, sive pastores, suo in genere
suspiciendos foenum esse oportet? Attamen inquiunt, inique iis qui Calvino
minus favent, symbolismus cum pontificiis impingitur: quoties enim eos
audivimus pro suggestu in Bellarminum and Jesuitas involantes? Nescio tamen
quonam malo fato accidat, ut cum in Scismaticos, quos Puritanos indigitant,
miseros homines, and omnium eruditorum judiciis explosos invehantur, eos
perinde ut Galbam non vis ingenii solum, sed and animi acris quidam dolor
dicentes incendat, efficiatque ut incitata, and vehemens eorum videatur oration:
contra vero, cum in pontificios stantes, and erectos, and tantum non Ecclesiae
and Academiae minantes detonandum esset, omnis motus animi tanquam ventus
homines deficit, and plane flaccescit oration: and Scismatis quidem radici
securem injiciunt, haereseos tantum ramos circumcidunt, seu potius sarmenta
quae luxuriant amputant. Hic vero eorum non egemus opera, offerunt se nobis
presbyteri, seculares, doctores Sorbonici, and tota Papistarum natio (solos
excipio Jesuitas) qui technas and versutias Jesuiticas, Romanorum pontificum
ambitionem, Caesarum coronis imminentem, and varias curiae Romanae corruptelas
multo quam ipsi acrius insectantur, omnes in hisce argumentis diserti sunt.
Quid est hoc aliud, quam cum capiti mederi debeant reduvias curare? Enimvero si
Papismi suspitionem serio a se cogitent amoliri, bona fide agant, pontificis in
Ecclesia principatum, seu potestatem spiritualem, missae sacrificium, crassam
praesentiam quam vocant realem, Transubstantiationis monstrum, justitiae
inhaerentis perfectionem, bonorum operum meritum, invocationem Sanctorum,
suffragia mortuorum, cultum imaginum, and reliquiarum, denique novum Pii quarti
symbolum, and conciliabuli Tridentini decreta non timide and diffidenter, sed
alacriter and fortiter impetant, and valentissima ratione profligent. Cum
Caecinae milites rebellem quemque in exercitu, noctu, ferro invasissent, truces
animos cupido postea involat, eundi in hostem, piaculum furoris: nec aliter
placari posse co^militonum manes, quam fi pectoribus impiis honesta vulnera
accepissent: utinam Deus iis hanc cupidinem inspiraret hostem communem
adoriendi, in piaculum furoris: nec enim aliter placari possunt, Calvini,
Bezae, Foxii, Anglo-Genevensium, and beatissimorum Martyrum manes, quos
irritarunt, quam si Ecclesiis reformatis hostium pontificiorum devictorum
manubias consecrent.

Haec habui, quae in malos pastores, qui aut omnino non pascunt, aut se
pascunt, non oves, aut oves pascunt, at non Christi, aut Christi oves pascunt,
at non salubri gramine, sed noxiis herbis in hoc tempus dicerem, in quibus si
quid mordacius videatur, Hieronymi verbis obsecro, ut non tam meae putetis
austeritatis esse quam morbi, putridae carnes ferro curantur, and cauterio,

SERMONS PREACHED AT PARIS IN THE HOUSE OF THE RIGHT HONOURBLE Sr. THOMAS
EDMONDS, LORD AMBASSADOR, RESIDENT IN FRANCE, LYING IN THE FAUXBURGE OF St.
GERMANS, IN THE YEARS OF OUR LORD 1610, 1611, 1612.
THE CHECK OF CONSCIENCE. THE XL. SERMON.
ROMANS 6.21. What fruit had yet then in those things, whereof ye are now
ashamed? for the end of those things is death.


Right Honorable, right Worshipful, etc.
NO speech of wisdom can be so discrectly uttered, but it may by ignorance be
depraved: no action of virtue can be so exactly performed, but it may through
malice be mis-construed. It is not more proper to God to bring light out of
darkness, peace out of trouble, joy out of sorrow, and out of sin (the
greatest of all evils) to extract much good, by governing and disposing it to
the declaration of his mercy and justice; than it is natural to the Devil and
his impes, out of the light of truth to endeavor to draw darkness of error,
and out of the best speeches and actions to strain and force out somewhat, to
maintain and nourish their corrupt humors and bosom sins. And what
marvel, since even in Paradise, amidst the sweetest flowers and wholsomest
herbs and plants, a Serpent could live, and find there something to feed upon?
Paradise was the seat of man's happiness, the garden of pleasure, the soil of
the tree of life, seated in the cleerest air, watered and environed with
sweetest rivers, enamelled with pleasantest flowers, set by God himself with
the choicest plants, and yet was it not free from the serpent, which turned the
juices of those sovereign and medicinal simples into poison. Aristotle writes
of the Cantharides, that they are killed with the sent of the Arist. de
mirabil. aus cult.
sweetest and most fragrant ointments: and it is morally verified in those
graceless hearers, to whom the Word, which is the 2. Cor. 2.16.
sweet smelling savor of God to life, becomes a savor of death. Such
hearers the blessed Apostle Saint Paul sharply censureth in this chapter, Occas.
who when he preached to them salvation by the free grace of Christ, hence
concluded free liberty of sin: when to the comfort of all that are heavy
laden with the burden of sin, he set abroach that heavenly doctrine, where
sin abounded, there grace superabounded; they subsumed, Let us therefore
continue in sin, that grace may more abound: whereas indeed they should have
inferred the clean contrary conclusion, thus: Grace has abounded much more to
us; therefore we of all men should not continue in sin, because God offers
us so good means to escape out of it. The dew of heaven has fallen
plentifully upon us; therefore we ought to be most fruitful in good works,
not only because God has better enabled us to do them, but also in a duty of
thankfulness we are to offer him our best service, who has enriched us with
the treasures of his grace. Therefore to beat them, and in them all carnal
Gospellers from the former hold, St. Paul in this chapter planteth ordnance of
many most forcible arguments, drawn from three principal heads. Analys.
1. Christ and his benefits. 2. Themselves and their former condition. 3. The
comparison between a sinful and a holy course of life, and their contrary
effects.


1 From Christ and his benefits after this manner: The effect of grace is to
mortify sin, how then can they who have received a greater measure of grace
by the merit of Christ's death and burial, continue in sin? How can they that
are dead to sin live therein? Whereas they urged grace for liberty of sin,
the Apostle from grace enforces sanctity of life: whereas they alleged their
redemption for their exemption from all service, Saint Paul strongly concludes
from so great a benefit, a greater tie and obligation to serve the Lord their
Redeemer: whereas they built a fort of sin with the wood of Christ's cross, he
makes an engine of the same wood to overthrow it: by grace we are united to
Christ, and planted in him; therefore we must live the life of the root, and
bring forth the fruit of the Ver. 5. Ver. 6.
spirit: If we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we
shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection, knowing this, that our old
man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
henceforth we should not serve sin, etc.

2 From themselves and their former condition, thus: When ye were free from
righteousness, ye were servants unto sin; now therefore being freed from
sin, ye ought to be servants unto righteousness: As ye Ver. 18, 19.
yielded your members servants of uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity, so
now yield your members servants of righteousness unto holiness, etc.

3 From the comparison between the state of sin and grace, thus: When you were
in the state of sin, you had no profit at all of your works, and you were
confounded with shame for them, and by them were brought to the very brink of
death; Coharent.
but now being in the state of grace, you reap fruit here in holiness, the
fruit of peace and joy, and hereafter you shall reap the fruit of everlasting
life and glory.

Thus you see the scope of the Apostle, the occasion and coherence of the
words, which carry this sense: Tell me, Exposit. Genesis
ye unsettled and unstable Christians, who have been delivered from the
thraldom of sin and Satan, and have given your names unto Christ, and your
members as servants unto righteousness; why go ye about to enthrall your
selves anew to your ghostly enemies, or make your selves vassals to your
fleshly lusts? Observe ye not the heavy judgments of God lighting daily upon
presumptuous sinners? See ye not before your eyes continual spectacles of
Gods justice? and mark ye not in them the fearful ends of those courses,
which now ye begin to take again, after ye had long left them? Believe ye
not the words of God, Romans 2 9.
Tribulation and anguish upon every soul that sins? for he will Psalm.
68.21.
wound the hairy scalpe of every one that goes on in his wickedness. Or if
you turn away your eyes from beholding the vialls of wrath daily powered upon
sinners, and stop your ears, that ye may not hear the dreadful threats
which God thundereth out in his Law against such backsliders and relapsers as
ye are: yet can ye stifle your own hearts grief? can ye forget the woeful
plight into which your former courses brought you, when free from
righteousness, ye let loose the reins to all licentiousness, that ye might
work wickedness even with greediness? ye glutted your selves with earthly
vanities, and took a surfeit of sinful pleasures. What gain did ye not then
greedily gape after? what preferment did ye not ambitiously seek? into what
mire of impurity did not ye plunge your selves? No sinful pleasure but ye
took your fill of, no dish of Satan which ye left untouched; yet speak the
truth between God and your own conscience, what true delight or solid
contentment took ye in those things? I know ye are ashamed to speak of it,
and I will not wound modest ears to relate it; and ought ye not much more to
be ashamed to return with the dog to his former vomit, and with the sow to
her wallowing in the mire? Your souls have been cleansed by the blood of your
Redeemer from all spots of impurity, will ye again pollute and soil them? It
is folly eagerly to pursue that which will bring you no profit at all; and
greater to follow afresh those things whereof ye were not only ashamed in the
enjoying them, but also are now confounded at the very mention of them: yet
this is not the worst, shame is but the beginning of your woe: For the end is
death, yea death without end. Will ye then forsake the ways of Gods
Commandments, leading to endless felicity, and weary your selves in the
by-pathes of wickedness, in the pursuit of worldly vanities, without hope of
gain, with certain loss of your good name, nay, of your life? will ye sell
heaven for the mucke of the earth? set ye so much by the transitory pleasures
of sin, mixed with much anguish and bitterness, attended on with shame, that
for them ye will be content to be deprived of celestial joys, the society of
Archangels and Angels, and the fruition of God himself for ever? nay, to be
cast into the dark and hideous dungeon of hell, to fry in eternal flames, to
be companions of ghastly fiends and damned ghosts, howling and shreeking
without ceasing, complaining without hope, lamenting without end, living, yet
without life, dying, yet without death, because living in the torments of
everlasting death?

Divis. and explicat. verb.
Having taken a general survey of the whole, let us come to a more particular
handling of the parts, which are three forcible arguments, to deter all men
from all vicious and sinful courses. 1. The first ab inutili, What fruit had
ye? 2. The second ab infami, Whereof ye are now ashamed. 3. The third a
pernicioso or mortifero, The end of these things is death.


1. Fruit.
What fruit. This word fruit is fruitful in significations; it is taken: 1
Properly, for the last issue of trees, and so it is opposed to leaves or
blossoms: for nature adorneth trees with three sorts of hangings as it were;
the first leaves, the second blossoms, the third fruits: in this sense the
word is taken in the first of Genesis, and in the parable of the fig tree
cursed by our Savior, because he found no fruit thereon. 2 Improperly, either
for inward habits, which are the fruits either of the spirit, whereof the
Apostle speaks, The Gal. 5.22.
fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; or of the flesh, reckoned up by the
same Ver. 19, 20.
Apostle; or for outward works, which are the fruits of the former habits:
whereof we read, Being Phil. 1.11.
filled with the fruits of righteousness: and in the Epistle of S. Jam. 3.15.
James, Full of mercy and good fruits: Or for the reward of these works, either
inward, as peace, joy, and contentment; whereof those words of S. Ver. 18.
James are to be meant, The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them
that make peace: and those of S. Paul, No Heb. 12.11.
affliction for the time is joyous, but grievous; but in the end it brings
the quiet fruit of righteousness to those that are exercised thereby: Or
lastly for outward blessings, wherewith God even in this life recompenseth
those who are fruitful in good works, as the Prophet Esaias and David assure
them: Surely it shall be Esaias 3.10. Psalm. 58.11.
well with the just: for they shall eat the fruits of their works: Utique est
fructus justo; Verily there is fruit for the righteous, verily there is a God
that judges the earth.


2. Had.
Had. It is written of the Lynx, that he never looks back; but Homer
contrarily describes a wise man, (...). looking both forward and backward,
forward to things to come, and backward to things past: for by remembering what
is past, and fore-casting things future, he orders things present: and in
special what advantage a Christian makes of the memory of his former sins,
and the sad farewell they have left in the conscience, I shall speak more
largely hereafter: for the present, in this cursory interpretation of the words
it shall suffice to observe from the pretertense habuistis, had ye? not
habetis, have ye? that sin, like the trees of Sodom, if it bear any fruit at
all, yet that it abides not, but as soon as it is touched falls to ashes.
Musonius the Philosopher out of his own experience teaches us, and that
truly, that if we do any good thing with pain, the pain is soon over, but
the pleasure remains; but on the contrary, if we do any evil thing with
pleasure, the pleasure is soon over, but the pain remains.

In those things whereof ye are now ashamed. 3. Those things.
As after the wound is healed there remains a scar in the flesh; so after
sin is healed in the conscience, there remains as it were a scarre of
infamy in our good name, and of shame also in the inward man. The act of sin
is transcunt, yet shame the effect, or rather proper passion of it, is
permanent: sin is more ancient than shame, but shame out lives sin. It is
as impossible that fire should be without scorching heat, or a blow without
pain, or a fever without shaking, as sin, especially heinous and grievous,
without a trembling in the mind, and shame and confusion in the soul. For, as
In Saturnal.
Macrobius well observes, when the soul has defiled her self with the
turpitude of sin, pudore suffunditur, and sanguinem obtendit pro velamento,
she is ashamed of her self, and sends forth blood into the outward parts, and
spreads ^t like a veil before her; just as the Sepia or Cuttle fish, when
she is afraid to be taken, Plin. not hist. l. 9. c. 29. Sepiae ubi sensere se
apprehendi, offuso atramento quod illis pro sanguine est, absconduntur.
sends from her blood like ink, whereby she so obscureth the water that the
angler cannot see her. If it be objected, that some men as they are past grace,
so past shame also, and some foreheads of that metal that will receive no
tincture of modesty, such as Zeno was in L. 16. Si clam scelera perpetrasser,
obscurum and minus gloriosum putabat; sin publicitus and aperte in conspectu
omnium absque pudore flegitiosus esset, id d^mum Principe and Imperatore dignum
putabat.
Nicephorus his story, who held it a disparagement to himself to commit
wickedness in secret, and cover his filthiness with the dark shadow of the
night; for that it became not sovereign majesty to fear any thing: he
thought he could not show himself a Prince, unless without fear or shame he
committed outrages in the face of the sun. Such were those Jews whom the
Prophet Jeremie brands in the forehead with the mark of a Strumpet that cannot
blush; Jer 8.12.
Were they ashamed when they committed abominations? nay, Jer. 3.3. Thou had
a whores forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
they were not ashamed, neither could they blush. I answer,

1 By distinguishing of shame, which is sometimes taken for the inward
affection and irksome passion of a sinner, that has cast any foul stain upon
his conscience; sometimes for the outward expression, by dejection in the
countenance, faultring in the speech, a cloud in the eye, and flushing in the
forehead and cheeks. No sinner is without shame in the first sense, though
many by custom in sin grow senseless thereof, and consequently shameless
in the latter sense; and in the end they come to that height of impudency,
that they blush for it if they blush, and are ashamed of their shamefacednesse,
and pudet non esse impudentem. But this hardiness does them no good at all;
for they do but stop the mouth of the wound that it bleed not outwardly, it
bleedeth inwardly the faster, and much more dangerously.

2 A sinner may be considered either before or after his regeneration; before
his regeneration he commits many sins, whereof he is not then ashamed,
either because he accounts them no sins, or not such sins as may any ways
trench upon his reputation. For though the dim light of corrupt nature
discovers some works of darkness, yet not all, nor any in the right hiew.
As a man that is in the water feels not the weight of it; so the sinner
whilst he is in the state of corruption feels not the weight of sin. For
he accounts great sins small, and small none at all: but when he is out of
that state, then he feels the smallest sin unrepented of as heavy as a
talent of lead, able to drown his soul in eternal perdition; as it follows:

For the end
For the end of these things is death. That is the end of all these things. By
end here the Apostle means not the final cause moving the sinner, but the
final effect of sin: for the sinner propounds to himself a diverse end;
either gain, which the covetous man shoots at; or glory, which the
ambitious; or pleasure, which the voluptuous: but they miss their mark, and
in stead of gain, which the covetous man promised himself in his sinful
course of life, in his return by weeping cross he finds irrecoverable
losses; (for what fruit had ye?) in stead of glory and honor, which the
ambitious aims at, shame and infamy; (whereof ye are now ashamed:) in stead
of a pleasant temporal life, which the voluptuous shot at, a painful and
eternal death. For the end of these things

Is death.
Is death. That is death temporal which is the sinners earnest as it were, and
death eternal, which is his full hire and wages; death corporal, which is the
separation of the soul from the body, is hastened by sin; death spiritual,
which is the separation of the soul from God, is sin; and death eternal, in
Scripture termed the second death, which is the tormenting of body and soul
for ever in the lake of fire and brimstone, is the full reward of sin; and
this death is here principally meant, as may be gathered from the words ensuing
my text; but the gift of God is eternal life: for that death which is opposed
to eternal life can be no other than eternal death.

Obser.
The meaning of the text being thus cleared, the special points of observation
are easily discerned; the first is, That the smart of the wound of conscience
for sins past is a special means, through grace, to keep us from sin to
come. Upon this the Apostle works in the words of my text, What fruit had ye
in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? The burnt child does not more dread
the fire, nor the scholar severely corrected beware the fault for which he
smarted, nor the Pilot keep off from the rock at which he formerly dashed his
bark, and hazzarded his life and goods, nor the intemperate gallant, tormented
with an extreme fit of a burning fever, forbear the pouring in of wine and
strong drinks, which were the oil that kindled and maintained the flame
within his bowels, than he that has felt the sting of sin in his conscience,
and been formerly confounded with the shame thereof, dreadeth and flies, and
seeks by all means to shun those sins which have left so sad a
remembrance behind them. As some parts of our bodies are more sensible than
others, (the sinewie parts more than the fleshly) yet all that have life in
them have some sense of pain: so some consciences are more tender, that feel
the least prick of sin; some harder, and more stupid and benumbed, like the
Solin. c. 29. Matres Ursorum diebus primis 14. in ^omnum ita concidunt, ut ne
vulneribus pridem excitati queant.
Numidian Bears, which scarce feel stripes or wounds: yet all that have any
life of grace in them, or use of reason, have some touch of conscience at some
times, which marreth all their mirth, and overcasteth their fair weather with
clouds of grief, pouring down showers of tears. I know the wicked seek to
dissemble it, like the man in Plutarch, who having a fox under his cloak,
never quatched, though the beast bit through his sides and devoured his bowels.
The Pro. 14.13.
fool, says Solomon, makes a mock of sin, but the heart knows the
bitterness of his soul: for even in laughing the heart is sorrowful, and the
end of that mirth is mourning. I speak not of a melancholy dumpe, but of an
habitual and constant pensiveness, arising from the sting of sin left in
the soul. No tongue can sufficiently express it, only the heart that feels
it can conceive the nature of this grief, and smart of this pain which the
lash of conscience imprinteth: Juven. sat. 13. Men's habet attonitos, and surdo
verbere caedit.
Occulto quatiente animum tortore flagello. Yet some sense we may have of it by
the similitudes whereby it is expressed. It is called a Act. 2.37.
pricking of the heart: and lest that we should imagine it to be as it were a
prick with a small pin, or needle, it is called a wound in the heart, (My
Psalm. 109.22
heart was wounded within me.) O what pain must a wound in the heart needs be,
where the least prick is death? Yet farther, that we might not think this
wound might be drawn together, it is called the cutting asunder of the heart,
( Joel 2.13.
Rent your hearts and not your garments: yet farther, that we might not think
any part of the heart to remain entire, it is called the Psalm. 51.17.
breaking of it into small pieces, and Psalm. 22.14.
melting these also; and can there be any sorrow like unto this sorrow, which
pricketh the heart, nay wounds it being pricked, nay rents it being wounded,
nay breaks it being rent, nay melts it being broken? This pricking,
wounding, renting, breaking, melting the heart, is nothing else but remorse of
conscience for some heinous and grievous sins, whereby Gods image in us is
defaced, our credit stained, our profession scandalized, and Gods anger
provoked against us. This remorse is found both in the godly, and in the
wicked: but in the one it is cured; or at least eased with seasonable comfort;
in the other this continual biting of conscience is without any ease, or hope
of cure: and therefore it drives them to blaspheme God, and curse themselves,
and sometimes to lay violent hands upon their own bodies, and apply a remedy
worse than the disease. In the godly and penitent it breeds a loathing and
detestation of sin, and a speedy recourse to the Physician of their souls,
with sighs and groans that cannot be expressed. For as Lactantius writes,
that the ashes of a burnt viper are a present remedy against the sting of the
viper, so the remains of sin in the conscience, viz. remorse and shame, are a
present remedy against sin; as we may see in David: Psalm. 51.3.
I know mine own iniquity, and my sin is ever before me: Psalm. 38.4, 5.
Mine iniquities are gone over my head, they are a burden too heavy for me to
bear; my wounds stink and are putrefied through my foolishness: and in
Solomon, who upon experience of the unfruitfulnesse of sin indicted that
excellent Sermon delivered in the book of the Preacher; the premises wherein
are, Eccl. 1.2.
Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of spirit: and the conclusion,
Eccl. 12.13.
Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is the whole man: and in the
Jews, who when Saint Peter set before their eyes their crucifying the Lord of
life, their saving a murderer and murdering their Savior, were Act. 2.37.
pricked in heart, and said, Men and brethren, what shall we do? And in the 2
Cor. 7.8, 9.
Corinthians, in whom remorse of conscience like the dart of Jason wrought a
strange cure, whereat the Apostle much rejoiced: Though I made you sorry, says
he, with a letter, I repent not. Nay I rejoice, not that ye were sorry, but
that ye were sorry to repentance: for godly sorrow causes repentance to
salvation not to be repented of. For behold this thing that ye have been
godly sorry, what great care it has wrought in you, yea what clearing of your
selves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what zeal; in all things ye
have showed your selves to be pure in this matter. For this cause Saint Paul in
his Epistles often rubbeth up their memory to whom he writes, with the
consideration of their former unregenerate estate: as the Corinthians; 1 Cor.
6.9.
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of heaven?
Be not deceived: Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
wantons, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor extortioners shall
inherit the Kingdom of God: and such were some of you; but ye are washed, but
ye are cleansed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of
the Lord Jesus. And the Ephesians; Ephesians. 5.8.
Ye were sometimes darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord: Ephesians. 4.17, 18,
19.
This therefore I testify unto you, that ye walk not from henceforth as
other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having their understanding
darkened, and being deprived of the life of God through the ignorance that is
in them, because of the blindness of their heart: which being past feeling
have given themselves to wantonness, to work all wickedness with
greediness. The Angel bid Tobias to unbowell the fish, and take out the gall,
as being useful in medicine and a special means to recover his eyesight:
The story is Apocryphal, but the application of it is Canonical, and
agreeable to the doctrine of the inspired Scriptures. If we unbowell wordly
pleasures and carnal delights, and take out the gall of them, that is,
seriously think upon the bitterness which they leave behind them, it will
prove a sovereign remedy against our spiritual blindness. A reason of this
observation we need not fetch far; wise men by others fall prevent their
own, but even fools learn a lesson from their woeful experience: Eras. Chil.
Piscator ictus sapit, the fisherman who hastily thrust his hand into his net
to take out a fish, and was stung by a Scorpion, was ever after wiser. Remorse
of conscience, if no Balm of Gilead be seasonably applied to it to assuage
the pain, is far worse than the sting of a Scorpion; which made Cain roar,
My punishment is greater than I am able to bear: which forced Judas to hang,
and Nero to stab himself, Julian the Apostata to tear his bowels and throw
them into the air, saying, Vicisti Galilaee. The greatest bodily torments that
can be devised have been borne cheerfully by many Martyrs; but a troubled
spirit, says the wise man, who can endure? Pro. 11.14.


This observation is not more pregnant in the proof, than poignant in the use,
both for trial and instruction. For if the experience of the unfruitfulnesse
and shamefulnesse of sin be a special curb of sin in the regenerate;
they surely who are not persuaded hereof, who taste no bitterness in the
forbidden fruit, who can think of their former sins not only without grief
and remorse, but also with some delight and contentment, were never thoroughly
converted. For there can be no vivification without precedent mortification; no
mortification where the old man is yet alive. There is a struggling in the soul
in the travel of our new birth between the flesh and the spirit, as there was
in the womb of Rebecca at the time of her labor between Jacob and Esau. Every
one, that is renewed in the spirit of his mind, Romans 7.22, 23.
delights in the Law of God, as touching the inward man; and therefore cannot
approve the law of the members rebelling against the law of the mind. He that
truly returns to God, and places his chief happiness in his union with
him, cannot but be offended grievously at the remembrance of those things that
made a separation between him and his God. The weeds that have taken deep root,
cannot be plucked up without stirring the earth. Such are the weeds of sin
rooted in our heart; they cannot be plucked up without tearing and breaking it
through contrition. That heart which has never bin so broken up, was never
thoroughly weeded. Wherefore (beloved Christians) if ye desire to know whether ye
are in the way of life, whether ye are effectually called, whether ye are in
the state of grace, whether ye have any part in the promises of salvation; lo
here is a touchstone to try your spiritual estate. When ye recall your former
profaneness, and uncleanness, and worldliness, and maliciousness to mind,
is the remembrance of these sins grievous unto you? is the burden of them
intolerable? are ye pricked in heart with the sting of conscience? do your
eyes melt into penitent tears? then are you quickened by the Spirit of grace,
then have you sense and life in you, then have your eyes been anointed with
the eye salve of the spirit, then stand ye recti in curia. But on the contrary,
Are ye tickled with the remembrance of your former follies? can ye think of
them without remorse? can ye speak of them without shame? can ye glory in
them, and your heart not smite you? then in vain do ye flatter your selves
with the name of Professors, ye falsely arrogate to your selves the title of
Sons of God, ye know not what regeneration or the new creature means, the
sun of righteousness never shone upon you, but ye are still frozen in the
dregs of your sins. Wherefore examine your own hearts and consciences,
take a view of your whole life past, run over in your minds the vanity of
your childhood, the lusts of your youth, the audacious attempts of your riper
years, and the covetousness, frowardness, worldliness, and distrustfulnesse
of your old age: call your selves to an account for your unlawful gaming and
sporting, your immoderate drinking, your Lords day breaking, your lascivious
dancing, your chambering and wantonness; and if the remembrance of these your
former sins be loathsome unto you, if the sent of them in the nostrils of
your soul be like a stinking fume exhaled from the finke of original
corruption, then have your senses been purged, then have you smelt the savor
of life. But on the contrary, if the cogitation of these things be delightful
unto you, if the traversing these thoughts in your mind blow the coals of your
former lusts, if the Sodom of your unregenerate estate seem to you as a
Paradise of pleasure, then certainly ye were never redeemed from the
corruption of the world, ye never felt the pangs and throes of a new birth,
your understanding was never enlightened, nor your will reformed. He that can
take delight to play at the hole of the Cockatrice, or behold the shining
color of the Snake, was never stung by them; but the truly regenerate
Christian, who has bin grievously stung by the fiery Serpent the Devil, and
by fixing his eyes upon the brazen Serpent Christ Jesus, has bin cured, dares
not come nigh the Serpents hole, much less gaze upon his azure head and forked
tongue.

2. If the experience of the unfruitfulnesse and shamefulnesse of sin be a
special means to restrain Gods children from it, certainly the recounting of
their former ways, and the survey of the whole course of their life, cannot
but be a profitable exercise for them. It was the practice of Solomon, who
beheld all the works of his hands, and the delights of his life, and passes
this censure upon them, Eccles. 1.2.
Vanity of vanities, all is but vanity and vexation of spirit. It was the
practice of David, Psalm. 51.3.
I know mine own iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. It was the
practice of Saint Austine, who a little before his death caused the Possid. in
vit. August.
Penitential Psalms to be written about his bed, which he looking upon, out
of a bitter remembrance of his sins, continually wept, giving not over, long
before he gave up the ghost. Me thinks, I hear you say, we have buried those
sins in oblivion long ago, and we hope God has done so: put not these
stinking weeds to our noses, but gather us a posie of the sweet flowers of
Paradise, the promises of God in Christ Jesus, in which there is a savor of
life, and we will smell unto it. I had rather do so, but the other are more
proper, and fitter for many of you; for those whose senses are overcome with
over-sweet ointments, can by no better means recover their smell, than by
strong and unpleasant savours: and therefore in the country of Arabia, where
almost all trees are savoury, and frankincense and myrrh are common fire wood,
Plin. not. hist. l. 12. c. 17. E Syria revehunt Stycacem acri odore ejus in
focis abigente suorum fastidium.
Styrax (as Pliny writes) is sold at a dear rate, though it be a wood of an
unpleasant smell; because experience proves it to be a present means to
recover their smell, who before had lost it. Beloved brethren, we all that have
lived in the pleasures of sin, have our senses stuffed and debilitated, if
not overcome; and the best remedy against this malady will be the smelling to
Styrax, the unsavory and unpleasing smell of our former corruptions. Let the
covetous man recall to mind his care in getting, his anxiety in keeping, his
sorrow in losing that which nature has put under his feet: how to increase his
heaps he has not only taken from others, but robbed his own belly and
back. Let the Glutton think of the loathsomeness of his sin, which
subjecteth him to diverse diseases, and makes him a burden to himself: the
Drunkard his drowning of his reason, distempering of his body, and exposing
himself to the laughter and scorn of all men: the Adulterer the corruption of
his own body, the transgressing the covenant of God, the wronging and
provoking his neighbor, the stain of his own reputation, the rottenness of
his bones, and besides all this, the heavy wrath of God for his sins, and
fear of hell fire due to him for them. I know no man willingly remembers that
whereof he is ashamed; and therefore no exercise of Christianity more tedious
and irksome than this, because it withdraws the mind from pleasant and
delightful objects, to behold her own deformity: yet none more necessary, none
more profitable. And though it begins in sorrow, yet it ends in joy: for even
this is an exceeding delight to the soul, to find a change in her self, and
an alteration in her affections: it is pleasant unto her that she now
distasteth the forbidden fruit, and she rejoices that she can be heartily
sorry for her sins. And God (as Cypr. de card. op.
Cyprian says sweetly) wipeth away these tears from the soul, Ut magis
ploret, and gaudeat fletibus, that she may weep the more, and take pleasure in
her weeping. For after we have pricked our hearts with the sting of conscience
for our grievous sins, after they bleed with compunction, after we have
powered out our souls with sighs and groans into the bosom of our Redeemer,
his heart will melt within him, and his repentings will roll together; he will
bind up our wounds, and show his wounds to his Father: then shall we see the
frowns of an angry Judge, turned into the smiles of a loving Father, the
crimson color of our sins into the whiteness of wool, our mourning weed into
a wedding garment, our sighs and sobs into exultation of spirit, and the
fearful cloud, which before overcast our minds, into a clear sky, into peace
of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, the true taste and beginning of the
joys of heaven. To which the Lord bring us for his Son Jesus Christ his sake.
Cui, etc.

THE VINE OF SODOM. THE XLI. SERMON.
ROMANS 6.21. What fruit had ye then in those things, etc.


Right Honorable, etc.
ALL the advised thoughts and purposes of men that are not elevated above the
level of earthly desires to a higher mark than the top of worldly happiness,
fall and fasten themselves upon such things as most nearly concern either life
it self, and the commodities or necessities of life, or their credit and
reputation among those with whom they live. These three, life, estate,
estimation, are their portion in this life; and therefore the maintenance of
them their chief care. The world has nothing besides these to allure and draw
on the love of her darlings: for the pleasures that are, spring out of these,
and are either their fruits or their blossoms; honor is the pleasure of the
ambitious, wealth of the covetous, and the pride of life of all. As for those
sensual delights, which now (I know not how) have engrossed the name of
pleasures to themselves, they receive their birth from youth, the spring of our
age, their nourishment and maintenance from wealth and prosperity. So that the
former limits, within which I have confined the aim and desires of the
natural man, stand sure and immovable. Of all things in this life, or rather
of this life, nothing is so dear and precious as life it self: for without it
neither honor, nor riches, nor pleasures can bring forth any fruit, because
they can have no root; life oftentimes surviveth them, they never survive it.
Howbeit, because a miserable and painful life is a kind of sensible death, and
to live and not to be reputed of, is in effect to be reputed not to be, infamy
and obscurity being the death of our name, and oblivion the burial of our best
parts: hence it comes to pass, that the restless desires and endeavors of
men for riches and honor, especially if they be pricked on forward by
covetousness and ambition, are not much less eager and violent, than is the
striving and struggling for life it self. The pursuit of these is the highest
flight of the natural man: but the regenerate Christian, who is of a nobler
breed, soareth far higher in his desires and affections; the life he pursues
is immortality, the riches he esteems of are celestial graces, the honor
he aspireth unto is a crown of glory.

Now the means to attain the ends of both, viz. temporal happiness, and
happy eternity, the glory of the Kingdoms of the earth, and a Kingdom of
glory in heaven, is one and the self same, the religious service of the only
true God, in whose gift they are: for 1 Timothy 6.6. etc. 4.8.
godliness is great gain, and has the promises of this life, and the life to
come: therefore by the law of contraries, ungodly and sinful courses must
needs be incommodious, and to our greatest loss, as having the curses of this
life, and the life to come. Whereby (as by many other things else) we may
perceive the folly and blindness of the natural man, who takes a wrong
course to compass his ends: for his way lies in the straight paths of Gods
Commandments; but he takes by-pathes laid out by Satan, and treads
endless mazes. As the Eras. Apoph.
Athenians, against whom Diogenes whet his cynick tooth in the feasts of
Aesculapius, even when they sacrificed to health, banqueted riotously against
health; so the worldly wise man, by inordinately desiring, and craftily
pursuing, and immoderately affecting the blessings of this life, loses them
and his life too: for these his desires and pursuits are sins, and by sin
all the promises and covenants of God, which are the only deeds by which we
hold our estate in the blessings of this life, are forfeited. Good God, how
does the god of this world delude the children of the world! whom he persuades
that the ready way to purchase all the comforts and contentments of this life,
is to fall down and worship him, and to sell themselves with Ahab to work
wickedness against God: whereas sin unrepented of, not only depriveth them
of all hope of a better life hereafter, but of all the joy of a good life here.
For it consumes their substance, it blasteth all the fruits of their labors,
it disableth and wastes their body miserably, troubles their consciences,
staineth their name, and shorteneth the days of their life. I fear there are
too many in the world, who have no mind of, because no knowledge of spiritual
riches and celestial joys; yet there is no man in his right senses, who
regards not either his estate, or his credit, or his life here. The ambitious
man little esteems worldly gain, because (Chamelion-like) he feeds upon
the air and breath of men's commendations. Again, the covetous man sets
light by praises and honor, because he (like the worm) feeds upon the
earth. The voluptuous man cares not much for honor or wealth, because (like
the Beetle) he feeds upon the doung of unsavory pleasures; yet there is
none of all three but tender their life: and therefore none who can be
unsensible of the Apostles incision in my Text. Does any desire the commodities
of this life? let them fly sin: for sin brings no fruit at all (What fruit,
etc.) Do any desire glory and honor? they must eschew sin: for sin
brings shame (Whereof ye are now ashamed.) Do any desire continuance of
life? they must abhor sin: for sin brings death; the end of these
things is death. Sin is altogether sterill and unfruitful, and therefore to
be set at naught: it is shameful, and therefore to be loathed: it is deadly,
and therefore to be fled from as from a Serpent. Here we have three peculiar
adjuncts of sin; sin is unfruitful for the time past, shameful for the
present, and deadly for the time to come: the first adjunct the unfruitfulnesse
of it is so fruitful of observations, that this hour may be fruitfully spent
in gathering them.

What fruit had ye? It was the usual demand of one of the wisest among the
Cic. in Verr.
Roman Judges, Cassius surnamed the Severe, in all cases of doubt, in matter
of fact about the person of the delinquent, Cui bono? who gained by the
bargain? on whose side lay the advantage? assuring himself, that no man of
understanding would put himself into any dishonest or dangerous action,
without hope of reaping some fruit by it; as also that there can be no
enterprise so beset with difficulties and dangers, which some men for apparent
hope of great gain and profit would not go through with: no arguments conclude
so necessarily in the opinion of the greater part of men, as those that are
drawn ab Demost. Olynth. 1. (...).
utili. This topic place the Devil made choice of above all other, Haec omnia
tibi dabo, in tempting our Savior: and though this his sharpest dart could not
enter into our Savior, yet it pierces the heart of most that are mere men,
whom when he cannot terrify with fears, he sets upon them argenteis
hastis, suggesting after this manner, Haec omnia tibi dabo, thus and thus it
shall be with thee: by usury, and oppression, and sacrilege, and cousenage,
thou shall gather much wealth, and become a great man. Wherefore it stands us
much upon to be able to rebate the edge of this sharp and dangerous weapon of
Satan, or to wrest it out of his hands, and fight against himself with it, as
the Apostle here does, What fruit had ye? What advantage have you made of
sin? what comes in by your unjust and ungodly courses? what do ye gain by
ventring your bodies and souls in Satan's bottom? what commodities do your
hellish voyages bring you?

If the Apostle had framed his interrogation thus: What pleasure had you in
those things whereof ye are now ashamed? they might easily have put it by,
saying, No wise man makes pleasure his summum bonum, or the mark he chiefly
aims at. If he had shaped it thus, What honor or credit got you by those
things whereof ye are now ashamed? a colorable answer might have been, We are
not vainglorious, we build not our fortunes in the air upon the breath of
other men's mouths: but when he thus brandisheth his sword, What fruit had ye
in those things? he touches them to the quick, and enforces them to answer
directly to his interrogatory, or condemn themselves of greatest folly; which
imputation of all other, men cannot brook. It is acutely observed by Arist.
Ret. l. 1. (...).
Aristotle, who with the same sharpness of wit pierced into the secrets of
nature, and mysteries of policy, that if you deal with a Counceller of state
about any motion of his in any public consultation, and prove unto him, that
what he propounded stood not with equity, or the honor of the state (as for
example, to take advantage upon the weakness of our neighbors and
confederates, to bring them under us, though they never offered us any wrong)
he will give you the hearing, and not vehemently contest with you: but if you
go about to demonstrate, that such a proposition of his, if it had taken
place, would have proved disadvantageous to the Commonwealth, he will be at
daggers drawing with you, and never be brought to yield to you in that point.
Whereupon he infers, that howsoever justice, honesty, the dignity and honor
of the Commonwealth are things to be thought upon, and serve for ornaments of
speech, and motives to some few, yet that which turns the balance, and
carries the greatest sway in all politic consultations, is matter of profit
and emolument, which he there determines to be the end of all deliberations.
And though Tully in his books Cic. de lib 7.
de oratore disliketh Aristotle's opinion herein, alleging against it the
practice of the Roman state, which (as he there would bear us in hand) ever
stood more upon nobler terms of their honor and sovereignty, than upon baser
respects of gain and profit; yet when he grew elder, and experience better
instructed him, in his book of partitions he concurreth with Aristotle in
judgment, and the Lacedaemonians in practice, who though they were otherwise
commended for their upright dealing, and harmless carriage, yet were noted
always to wave the point of honesty, ubi de commodis Reipublicae ageretur,
when the commodity of the Commonwealth was interessed therein. That Maxim of
the Parthians, Nulla fides nisi prout expedit, no faith (or keeping touch with
any) but as it makes for advantage, is not more abhorred by Statesmen in their
words, and confuted in their discourses, than exemplified by them in their
actions.

Wherefore, since the consideration of profit and emolument is of so great
importance in all affairs and passages of life, let us see whether the vines
of Sodom, or the trees of Paradise are more fruitful; or rather whether sin
be not altogether unfruitful. For if it appear so, then has the worldly man
no cover or shelter for his sin; and that it is so, appears not only by
this interrogatory of the Apostle, and the paralleld Text thereunto, Ephesians.
5.11.
have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but reprove them
rather: but also by the most usual names of sin in Scripture, 1. Folly. 2.
Vanity. 3. A Lie.


1. Sin is called folly, because the sinner is very witty in inventing
sleights to deceive himself withal, cunning and secret in spreading a net,
and laying a snare to catch his own soul in: he takes great pains, and
keeps much ado to undo himself, and can there be greater folly than this?
As the wisdom of God made known by the preaching of the Gospel seems
foolishness to the worldly man; so it is most true, that the wisdom of this
world is folly with God, and often called by that name in the Proverbes and
Ecclesiastes.

2. As sin is called folly, so it is called also Psalm. 14.1. and Pro. 7.22.
and 11.29. and 12.15. and 19.1. etc.
vanity: for sin is vain, because empty of all goodness, because it has
nothing in it, because the projects and enterprises of the sinner take no
effect, or not such as he promised himself.

3 In the same respect all sins in general are termed lies: because they
promise and make show of great gain, comfort, and contentment to be reaped by
them; whereas they bring nothing less, but are like the deceitful ground in
the Poet that mocketh the husbandman: Virg. Geor. 1.
Expectata seges vanis elusit avenis. This reason Saint L. 14. de Civ. Dei, c 4.
Beatus vult ess, etiam non sic vive ido ut possit esse: quid est hac voluntate
mendacius? unde non frustra dici potest omne peccatum esse mendacium: non enim
sit peccatum nisi ea voluntate qua volumus ut been sit nobis, vel nolumus ut
male; ergo mendacium est, quod cum fiat ut been sit nobis, hinc potius male est
nobis: vel cum fiat ut melius sit nobis, hinc potius pejus est nobis.
Austine was well pleased with, as appears by his often running upon it: They
would, says he, be blessed who take a course to hinder themselves from
blessedness, or deprive themselves of it: in which regard all sin may be
called a lie, because no man commits sin but out of a desire to do good
to himself, whereas indeed by his sin he hurts and endammageth himself.
I find three Emblemes in holy Scripture, whereby this truth is represented to
the eye.

The first is, Psalm. 12.8. Impii ambulant in circuitu, the wicked walk in a
circle, or a ring; which the Holy Ghost affirms of them, not so much because
they often traverse the same thoughts, and tread a kind of maze in their
minds, as because their labors and travels prove in the end fruitless and
unprofitable. For in a circle, though we run never so fast, we gain no
ground, but the faster we go forward the nearer we come to the same point we
set out at: as we see the laboring horse or ox in the mill travelleth all the
day long, and wearieth it self, yet at night it is in the same place where it
was in the morning; so the wicked spends his strength, and runs himself
out of breath in the ways of vanity, and yet makes no progress at all.

The second Emblem is a Spider weaving a curious web, or a foolish man
hatching the eggs of a Cockatrice: Esa. 59.4, 5, 6
They trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth
iniquity. They weave the Spiders web, and hatch the Cockatrice eggs: he that
eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a
Viper. Their webbes shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act
of violence is in their hands.

A third we have drawn by the Prophet Hos. 8.7.
Hosea; a man going about to sow the wind: They have sown the wind, and they
shall reap the whirlewind: it has no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal.

Desire you yet a fourth? you shall find it in the Prophet Esa. 29.8.
Esaias; a man dreaming of great feasts and riotous banqueting all night long,
and in the morning finding his belly lanke, and his stomach empty: He shall
be as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold he eats; but he awaketh and
his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and behold he drinks;
but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his soul longs for drink.

Now although where we have divine authority and humane experience for any
truth, we need not crave aid from reason: yet to furnish you with all sorts
of arguments against this most common, yet most dangerous temptation of Satan,
whereby he deludeth most men, persuading them that the ready way to thrive is
to enlarge their consciences, and take fraudulent, violent, or unjust courses;
I will propose some arguments now, and more hereafter, to demonstrate sin to
be altogether unfruitful, all things being reckoned together. For if the
pretended commodities accrewing by sin no way countervaile the certain
losses growing from it, it cannot be denied that sinful courses are
unprofitable and disadvantageous. What then is that which may be gained by
sin, if any thing may be got by it? Earthly commodities, houses, grounds,
money, plate, stuff, and the like. But what loses the sinner by it? Heaven,
and the glory of an immarcessible garland: so that as Demades sometime spoke to
the Athenians, Eras. Apoph.
Cavete ne dum de coelo contendatis, terram amittatis; Take heed lest while ye
strive about the heaven or situation, you lose your land; we may thus invert,
cavete ne dum de terra contendatis, coelum amittatis, takes heed lest while ye
strive for earth, ye lose heaven. What loss can be comparable to this, except
the loss of our own souls, which comes by sin also, and Mar. 8.36.
what profits it a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or
what shall he receive in recompense for his soul? without which he is made
incapable of receiving any thing at all. What good can melodious music, or
sweet ointment, or banqueting dishes, or costly jewels do to a carcass? and
what are we else when we have lost our souls? Dearly beloved Christians,
think of these words of our Savior when the Devil opens his pack, and
sets out his counterfeit wares before you, crying, O come hither, what lack
ye? buy of me honors, and pleasures, and lands, and possessions, and gardens
of delight, and stately palaces, and rich furniture, and what heart can desire;
Alas, what will it advantage you to gain these things, and lose your soul?
what joy, delight, or comfort can these things bring to you when your soul is
gone, that is, when you are not? Moreover, consider what are these wares
whereof Satan makes such ostentation, gilding them over with the names of
honors, riches, and pleasures: no other than such as you see in some
Haberdashers shop, feathers and glasses, things of small value, less use, and
no continuance; and yet so impudent is he, that he is not ashamed to ask for
these trifles, for these crepundia, these Tricae, apinaeque, aut si quid vilius
istis, all the jewels and spiritual graces which enrich the soul, nay a
crown of glory in heaven, nay your very soul: and yet he wants not Chapmen,
nay, which all the tears that misery and compassion ever shed are not
sufficient to be wail, men throng, and press, and strive who shall make the
first bargain with him.

I forbear to number reasons, and deliver you arguments as it were by tale. I
beseech you weigh these which I have brought, in the scales of the Sanctuary,
and grieve not from henceforth though wicked men become Psalm. 49.16, 17.
rich, and the glory of their house be increased; for they shall carry nothing
away with them when they dye, neither shall their pomp follow them: they shall
carry nothing with them, but they shall be carried by evil Angels to the
dungeon of hell; neither shall their pomp follow them, but shall rather go
before them to the place of mourning, shricking, and endless disconsolation.
Stoop not, O stoop not to take up those golden apples, which Satan casts
before you in your holy race, to stay your course, and deprive you of your
garland: for either they have but a show of fruit, and are not apples indeed;
or if they are true apples, sin bears them not: for God has cursed the
forbidden tree, as Christ did the Mat. 21.19.
fig tree in the Gospel, saying, Let no man gather fruit of thee for ever.

What fruit had ye? Propound unto your selves (Beloved) often this question of
the Apostle, and the other of our Savior, What will it advantage a man to win
the whole world, and to lose his own soul? that ye may be ready with an
answer when the Devil assaulteth you, as he did our Savior, with an Omnia
dabo, Mat. 4.9.
All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall down and worship me,
Avoid Satan father of lies; thou give all these things! neither do thou
give any thing, but sellest at the dearest rate; neither are those things thou
offerest in thy hands, but in Gods; neither are they to be gotten by
worshipping thee, but by serving him: for thus it is written, Psalm. 25.13.
He that fears the Lord, his soul shall dwell at ease, and his seed shall
inherit the earth. Psalm. 128.1, 2, 3.
Blessed is he that fears the Lord, and walks in his ways; for he shall
eat the labor of his hands, and happy shall he be: his wife shall be as
the fruitful vine by the walls of his house, his children shall be like Olive
branches round about his table: 1 Timothy 4.8.
and, godliness has the promises of this life, and the life to come.

Howbeit a weak Christian may be troubled in mind, when he sees houses
full of the treasures of wickedness, and he hears it as a common Proverb,
that fawning and cosenage are the gainfullest trades in the world: Juven. sat.
1.
Criminibus debent hortos, praetoria, mensas. The Courtier is indebted to his
flattery for his large revenues, the Citizen to usury and misery for the
swelling of his bags, the Artisan to his fraud and cozening for his wealth,
the Impropriator to his sacrilege for his best manors and palaces, the
ambitious Diotrephes to simony for his dignities and preferments.
Notwithstanding these and many the like instances may be brought against the
doctrine delivered, yet is not the truth thereof impeached. For either the
great gainer by sin, and bargainer with Satan shall never live to enjoy his
wealth; which the Prophet David observes, saying, Psalm. 37.1.2, 10, and Psalm.
73.18, 19.
Fret not at the ungodly, neither be thou envious at the evil doers; for they
shall be cut down as the grass, and wither as the green herb: O how
suddenly do they consume, perish, and come to a fearful end? Or if like
fortunate Pirates they live long, and go clear away with the prize they have
gotten, yet they can take no quiet contentment therein, because they know they
have no right to it; and therefore they are still in fear either of losing it,
or paying too dear for it. And howsoever they may escape while they are at the
sea, yet when they arrive at the haven of death, they shall make shipwreck of
it and their souls.

Or God blows upon the fruits of their labors, and blasteth the increase of
their wealth; according to the words of St. Jam. 5.2.
James, Your riches are corrupt, your garments are moth-eaten, your gold and
silver are cankered, and the rust of them shall be as a witness against you,
and eat your flesh as it were fire.

And as they got their goods, so they shall lose them; Eras. Chil.
Salis onus unde venerat illuc abit, says the Latin Proverb, the burden of
salt is returned thither from whence it was first taken. The occasion whereof
was a ship laden with salt by a wrack torn in pieces, let the salt fall into
the sea from whence it came: so for the most part goods gotten by the spoil,
are lost likewise by the spoil. For we see daily that they which spoil
others are spoiled themselves, and that which is gotten by extortion, is
extorted again out of the hand of the extortioners. Suet. in Vesp.
Vespasian his covetous officers that by rapine and exaction filled themselves
like spunges, after they were full were squiezed by the Emperor: and as the
Prophet Mic. 1.7.
Micah observes, that which was gathered by the hire of a whore, returns to
the wages of an harlot.

Or if their goods and honors stick by them, and they have wrought themselves
into so great favor with the Prince, that they have no fear at all of being
called to an account, much less of being discomposed and turned out of their
offices, honors, wealth and all, yet they can take no comfort in their estate,
no joy in that they enjoy. For what does music delight him who has an
aposteme in his ear? or gold, silver, or precious stones him who has a pearl
in his eye? or dainty dishes him whose taste is distempered with sickness?
This is the worldlings case, he has goods laid up for him many years; but
they are not goods to him, because they do him no good; he is no whit the
better for them, but the worse; no whit the richer in mind, but the more
wretched and poorer: Magnas inter opes inops. He may take his fill of
pleasures, but they are no pleasures to him, because he has no sense of them:
all dainties are provided for him, but they are not dainties to him, because
he cannot taste them; and the reason is, he is heart sick with cares and
griefs, and affrighted with terrors of conscience.

Yea, but it will be objected, that no such thing appears: for none seem so
merry and frolic as some of these albae galinae filii, the worlds darlings. I
answer with Saint 2 Cor. 5.12.
Paul, That they laugh in the face, but not in the heart: and with Solomon,
Eccl. 7.6.
That all their mirth is but like the crackling of thorns under a pot, soon
turned into ashes and mourning. Their merriment is like to that of those who
have eaten the herb Sardonia in Sardinia, who are said to Solin. c. 12.
Sardonia herba comesta rictu ora diducit, ut morientes ridentium facie
intereant.
dye laughing: or like that of Hannibal, which the Historian calls amentis
risum, the laughing of a man distracted, which is suddenly accompanied with
tears. Lastly, add we to all these disadvantages, the price we are to pay
for Satan's commodities in the prison of hell, whereof one Mat. 5.26. Thou shall
not go thence till thou have paid the utmost farthing.
farthing shall not be abated: and I doubt not but as the Prophet Daniel spoke
of King Nebuchadnezzars dream, Dan. 4 19.
This dream be to the Kings enemies; so ye will all say, the gain that is
gotten by evil means and ungodly practices be unto Gods enemies; let them
trucke with Satan who have no part in God: but let all that desire to thrive
both in their outward and inward estate, and to be Mat. 6.19.
rich in God, follow the advice of our Savior, Lay not up for your selves
treasures, especially treasures of wickedness, upon earth, where the canker of
covetousness corrupts, and the moth of envy fretteth, and restless cares,
and watchful fears like thieves in the night break through the walls of your
body, and enter into the closet of your heart, and steal away all your joy and
contentment; but lay up for your selves treasures in heaven, where neither the
moth nor canker corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be. Our treasure (O Lord) is
in heaven, even in thee, let our heart be there continually with thee. Cui, etc.

THE GRAPES OF GOMORRAH. THE XLII. SERMON.
ROMANS 6.21. What fruit bad ye in those things, etc.


Right Honorable, etc.
SOlinus Cap. 35. Praecipua ficus Aegyptia poma non ramis tantum gestitans, sed
and caudice septies anno fert fructum, etc.
writes of the Egyptian fig tree, that it bears fruit not only on the
branches, but also on the main stock and trunck; so fruitful is this parcel
of Scripture, on which my meditations have pitched and rested themselves these
three Lords days: it bears fruit, and that in great variety, not only upon
the branches, but upon the maine stock* which yields us this fruitful
observation, That the sense and taste of the bitterness of sins past, and
remorse of conscience for them, are most forcible motives and means to
restrain the desires, and weane the affections of Gods children from them.
This fruit we gathered heretofore, and since plucked to us the first branch of
the Text, which affords this most wholesome observation. That sin is
altogether unfruitful. As no meditation is more serious, than upon the vanity
of the world; no contemplation more pleasant to a regenerate Christian, than of
the unpleasantnesse of impure delights: so no observation is more fruitful,
than of the unfruitfulnesse of sin. Who cannot copiously declaime against
sin, against which it is a sin not to declaime? Who cannot easily recount
all the evils which sin has brought into the world, which are summarily all
that are in the world? insomuch that all sciences, arts, and professions have a
blow at sin. The Metaphysicke Philosopher demonstrateth, that sin is non
ens, naught: and therefore to be set at naught. The Naturalist shows that it
destroys nature: and therefore ought to be exterminated out of nature. The
Moralists muster all the forces of virtue against it, as being the chiefest
enemy of man's chief good, which they define to be actio virtutis in vita
perfecta, the continual practice of virtue in a happy life. The Physicians
observe, that the greater part of the diseases of the body arise from sins,
which are the diseases of the soul: Plures gula, quam gladio, more come to
their end by gluttony, drunkenness, and incontinency, than by the halter or
the sword. The Grammarians condemn sin as incongruous; the Logicians as
illogicall, that is, unreasonable; and all other arts and sciences as
irregular: but Divinity alone knocks it down and battereth it to pieces with
the hammer of the Word. There is more weight of argument in this one Verse of
the Apostle, than in all the Orators declamations, and Poets satyrs, and the
Philosophers invectives against vice that ever were published to the world.

What fruit had ye in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of
those things is death. As the same metal running upon diverse moulds is cast
into diverse forms; so the words of this Text admit of diverse divisions,
according to several moulds and frames of art. It shall suffice to give you
your choice of three. 1. The Rhetorical, which breaks them into 1. A
poignant interrogation, What fruit had ye? 2. A forcible reason, For the end
of those things is death.
2. The Logical, which observes in them 1. The persons, Ye. 2. The object,
Those things. 3. The attributes: which are three, 1. Loss, What fruit had ye?
2. Confusion, Whereof ye are now ashamed. 3. Peril, For the end of those
things is death.

3. The Theological, which considers sin in a threefold relation, 1. To
the time past; and so it is unfruitful: What fruit. 2. To the time present;
and so it is shameful: Whereof, etc. 3. To the time to come; and so it is
dreadful or deadly: For the end of those things is death.



First of sin, considered in a relation to the time past.

What fruit had ye? Xerxes (as Herodotus reports) bare a strange affection
to the Plane tree, which he hung about with chains, and decked with jewels of
greatest price. A fond and foolish affection, as being to a tree, and such a
tree as is good for nothing but to shade us out of the Sun. This folly of so
great a Monarch very well resembles the humor of all those, who are not
guided by the Spirit of God into the ways of truth and life, but are led by
the spirit of error, or the error of their own spirit, to ungodly and
sinful courses, the very beaten paths to hell and death. The tree they are in
love with, adorn, and spend so much cost upon, is the forbidden tree of sin,
altogether as unfruitful as that of Xerxes; it has neither fair blossoms,
nor sweet fruit on it, only it is well grown, and has large arms and broad
boughs, and casts a good shade, or to speak more properly, a shadow of
good. For the shade it self of this tree is like the shade of the Cyprus tree,
gravis umbra, a noisome or pestilent shade, making the ground barren, and
killing the best plants of virtues, by depriving them of the Sunshine of Gods
grace. Yet, as diverse Nations in the days of Not. hist. l. 12. Tributum and
pro umbra pendunt.
Pliny paid tribute to the Romans for the shade of these trees; so do these
men pay for the seeming pleasure and delight of sin, being indeed but a
shadow of vanity to the Devil, the greatest tribute that can be paid, the
tribute of their souls. To reprove this folly to be bewailed with bloody
tears, I have heretofore produced diverse passages of holy Scripture: the point
of doctrine I beat upon, and labored especially to fasten in your hearts, was
the unprofitablenesse and the unfruitfulnesse of sin: which was proved

1. By the three names of sin imposed by the Holy Ghost, folly, vanity, and
a lie. The reason whereof was, because all sin makes a show of, and (as it
were) promises to the sinner either pleasure, or profit, or honor, or some
good; whereas indeed it brings not any thing to him but shame, nor him to any
thing but death.

2. By diverse lively comparisons and resemblances in holy Scripture of sinful
labors and travells, as the running in a ring or circle, whereby he that
moves and tireth himself, gets no ground; impii ambulant in circuitu: the
weaving of the Spiders web, which makes no garment: the sowing of wind,
whereof nothing can be reaped but the whirlewind, storms, and tempests of
conscience.

3. By the judgments of God falling upon them, who seem to drive the most
gainful trade with Satan. For either they themselves are taken away in the
midst of their prosperity, and as soon as they have gotten the wealth of the
world, are constrained to leave a world of wealth; Luke 12.20. O fool, this
night they shall take away thy soul.
Stulte, hac nocte eripient tibi animam tuam: or God blows upon their ill
gotten goods, and they are suddenly consumed, or pass the same way that they
came; as the fogges that are raised by the Sun, when they come to their
height, are dispelled by his beams: Or they prove like the horse of Sejanus,
or the gold of Tolous, or the vessels and treasures of the Temple at Jerusalem,
which became the bane and ruin of all that laid hands on them: Or if they long
enjoy their wealth, yet they joy not in it at all. For howsoever none lay
claim to their unrighteous Mammon, yet they can never persuade themselves that
it is their own; and between care of keeping, and fear of losing, and
expectation of punishment for ill getting them, by tyranny, exaction,
oppression, forged cavillation, fraud, simony, or sacrilege, no place is left
for any joy or comfort in possessing, or well using them.

4. By putting the seeming profits and advantages of sin in one scale, and
the losses and disadvantages by it in the other: which being done, the scale of
damages and losses will bear down to the ground, nay to hell. In all
bargains we are to consider not so much what the commodity is we trade or
traffic for, as what the price is: for though the merchandise we bargain for
be of great value, yet if we must over-buy it, giving for it an unreasonable
rate, the bargain cannot be good. By which rule, if we examine our traffic,
we shall find, that if we hold on our trade with Satan, our merchandise will
no way countervaile our charge, our gains in the beginning will be no way
answerable to our losses in the end: for we shall lose the inheritance of a
Kingdom in heaven, and our own souls. Unfruitfulnesse, shamefulnesse, and
deadliness are three proper adjuncts, and (as the Logicians usually speak)
passions of sin. For all sin is mortal, that is, deserving death; and
nothing is mortal in that sense but sin: all sin is shameful, and nothing
shameful but sin: all sin is unfruitful, and nothing absolutely is
unfruitful but sin. The Serpents feed upon, and consume that poisonous
matter, which otherwise would infect the earth, water, and air. Physicians
make treakle and antidotes of poison: the ashes of a Viper, the oil of a
Scorpion, the wings of the Cantharides, are sovereign remedies against the
poison of those Serpents: yea, the very doung of the earth serves for very
good use, and fatteneth the ground; only sin, as it is deprived of the good
of being a nature, so it depriveth nature of all good. If any things come near
to sin in this, they are the grapes of Gomorrah, and apples of Sodom, which
have no taste at all in them, but as soon as they are touched fall to dust;
and the dust is of that nature, that it serves not as doung to fatten the
earth, but rather as unsavory salt, which makes it barren. All the endeavors
and operations of nature, when they are not set out of their course by sin,
forcibly tend to some good, and obtain it also. For if they produce not, and
leave behind them some work, the worth whereof may recompense the labor about
it; yet the very contention and exercise of the faculty breeds a dexterity
and facility of doing the like: it perfecteth the skill, strengthens the
faculty, accommodateth the organ, and thereby makes the whole body more
serviceable to the soul, and the soul better disposed to virtuous acts and
habits. The Archer, who often misseth the mark set before his eyes, yet in
some sort hitteth the mark he aimed at in his mind, which was the exercise of
his arm, and learning to shoot. As the sons of the husbandman in the fable,
who being told by their father lying on his deathbed, that he left much gold
buried under the ground in his Vineyard, fell on delving and digging all about
the Vines; and though they found no gold, yet by stirring the mold about the
roots of the trees, gained a great vintage that year: even so it falls out
in the labors and travells of our calling; though by them we reap not
always that profit we expect, yet thereby we may manure (if I may so speak)
the ground of our hearts, and gain great store of those fruits, which the
branches that are graffed into the true Vine Christ Jesus, bear. But in
sinful labors and travells it fares otherwise; they are not as moderate
exercises which strengthen, but as violent fits which weaken nature. Sin in
the understanding darkeneth the thoughts, in the will depraveth the desires, in
the sensitive appetite disordereth the affections, in the outward sense
corrupts the organs, and in the whole body breeds loathsome and painful
diseases. Sin is not only unfruitful, (to speak in the language of the
Schools) formaliter, but also effective; not only unfruitful in it self, as
the Mat. 21.19.
fig tree in the Gospel cursed by our Savior, but also in its effects, as
that other tree which was to be plucked up, ne terram redderet infructuo sam,
that it might not make the ground Luke 13.7.
barren. For sin makes the spirit barren of the fruit of good motions, the
understanding barren of the fruit of good meditations, the will barren of the
fruit of good resolutions, the sensitive appetite barren of the fruit of good
affections, the whole man barren of the fruit of good works: nay, the earth and
trees also barren of their fruit and increase. For the sin of man God cursed
the earth, and it Genesis 3.18.
brought forth thorns and thistles; and the heaven and sky also, and it
became as Deuteronomy. 28.23.
iron over men's heads: the experience whereof brought the Heathen to
acknowledge this truth, Senec. in Oedip.
Sperare poteras sceleribus tantis
Dare regnum salubre,
Fecimus coelum nocens.
Our sins have tainted the influence of the stars, dried up the clouds,
infected the air, blasted the fruits of the earth. And Claudian in his
investive against Eutropius, -- Quae connubia prolem
Aut frugem laturus ager? quid fertile terris,
Aut plenum stirili possit sub consule nasci?
Is it possible any thing should thrive or flourish under the shade of such a
Consul? Saint Advers. Demet. Quereris quod minus nunc tibi uberes, fontes, and
aurae salubres, and frequens pluvia, and fertilis terra obsequium, praebeant,
quod non ita utilitatibus and voluptatibus tuis elementa deserviant: Tu enim
Deo servis, per quem tibi cuncta deserviunt? Tu famularis illi, cujus nutu tibi
unviersa famulantur?
Cyprian also attributes the great dearth in his time to the want of charity;
and the sterility of fruits in the earth, to the sterility of fruits of
righteousness: Thou complainest that the springs are not so full, the air so
healthy, the showers so frequent, the earth so fruitful, as in former time:
thou think much that the elements are not so obsequious to thee as they have
been, that they serve not thy profit and pleasure: Why? art thou so obsequious
to God? Do thou serve him, by whose appointment all these things serve thee?
As it was the manner of the Persians, when a noble person committed a fault, to
beat his clothes in stead of him; so it pleases our most indulgent Father,
when the noblest of his creatures, men his children offend, often for them to
punish the beasts of the field, and fruits of the earth, which feed and clothe
them. As he threatens, Deuteronomy. 28.38, 39, 40.
Thou shall carry out much seed into the field, and shall gather but little:
for the Locusts shall consume it. Thou shall plant vineyards, and dress them,
but shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes: for the worm
shall eat them. Thou shall have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but
thou shall not anoint thy self with the oil: for thine olive shall cast his
fruit. Hereunto if we add the infinite armies of plagues and judgments
mustered in this chapter against Gods enemies, we cannot but subscribe to the
Prophets conclusion, Non est pax impio, there is no Esaias 48.22. and 57.21.
peace to the wicked, says my God: there is no fruit of sin; for it is the
vine of Deuteronomy. 32.32, 33.
Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: the grapes thereof are the grapes of
gall, their clusters are bitter. Their wine is the poison of Dragons, and the
cruel venom of Aspes.

Would ye know all the miseries that sin has brought into the world? reckon
then all that are, or ever were in the world. For they are all concomitants,
effects, or punishments of sin. Sin cast the Angels from Heaven into Hell,
thrust man out of Paradise, drowned the old world, burnt Sodom and Gomorrah
with fire and brimstone, ruinated the greatest Monarchies, destroyed the
ancientest Cities, and has rooted up the most flourishing Churches; and shall
we look for better fruit of it?

But this interrogatory of the Apostle, What fruit had ye? seems to me
rather to aim at the particular endammagement and detriments of sin, which
every soul that commits it sustaineth within it self, whereof many have
been already recounted, yet the greater part is behind, among whom this is not
the least, that it blinds the eyes of the mind, and infatuateth the sinner.
Whereupon Saint Austines observation is, If a thief or fellon should presently
upon his fact lose the sight of his eyes, every body would say, that it was the
judgment of God upon him. Oculum cordis amisit, and ei pepercisse putatur
Deus: behold God has taken away the sight of his souls eyes, and do thou
think that he spares him, or lets him go Cic. de Arusp. respons.
Oculorum caecitas ad mentem translata est.
unpunished? What greater loss to a noble mind than of liberty, which is
forfeited by sin? Sin enthralleth our soul to our body, and our body and
soul to the Devil. If captivity of the body be so grievous a calamity, what
may we judge of the captivity of the soul? If we so disdain to be slaves
to men, how much more should we to be vassals to beastly lusts? To speak
nothing of peace of conscience, which crying sins disturb; and divine
motions, which worldly cares choke; and heavenly comforts, which earthly
pleasures deprive us of; and sanctifying graces, which impure thoughts and
sinful desires diminish: to leave the consideration of shame and death for
matter of ensuing discourses; by that which has been already delivered, all
that are not besotted by sin, and blind-folded by Satan, may see great reason
for this question of the Apostle, What fruit had ye? A question which the
proudest and most scornful sinners, who have them in derision that make
conscience of unlawful gain, shall propound unto themselves one day, and
check their own folly therewith, as we read in the book of Wisd. 5.8.
Wisdom: What has pride availed us? or what profit has the pomp of riches
brought us? Then shall they change their minds, when they cannot their
estates, and sigh for grief of heart, and say within themselves, looking up to
Heaven, and seeing the felicity of the righteous crowned with eternal glory:
Ibid. Ver. 4, 5, 6, 7.
This is he whom we sometimes had in derision, and in a parable of reproach.
We fools thought his life madness, and his end without honor. But now how
is he accounted among the children of God? and what a portion has he among
the Saints? Therefore we have erred from the way of truth: and the light of
righteousness has not shined upon us. We have wearied our selves in the ways
of wickedness, and have gone through many dangerous paths: and the way of the
Lord we have not known.

Howbeit, two sorts of men in the opinion of the world seem to make great
gain of sin; the covetous and the ambitious: the former is indebted to his
extortion, oppression, and usury for his wealth; the other to his glozing,
dissembling, undermining, perfidious and treacherous dealing for his honor,
and advancement in the Court of Princes. The spirit of the former has been
conjured down heretofore, by proving that whosoever gathers wealth or money
by unjust and indirect means, puts it into a broken bag, and that his
money shall perish with him, unless he break off his sin by repentance, and
make friends of unrighteous Mammon. I come to the Politicians, who correct, or
rather pervert that sentence of Saint Paul, Godliness is great gain, thus; a
show of godliness is great gain: of whom I would demand what show of reason
they have for this their politic aphorism? If they believe there is a God
that judges the earth, they cannot but think that he will take most grievous
vengeance on such as go about to root out the fear of God out of men's
hearts, and make Religion a masque, and God himself an Image, the sacred Story
a fable, Hell a bug-beare, and the joys of Heaven pleasant fantasies. If men
hold them in greatest detestation who faulter and double with them, shall not
God much more hate the hypocrite, who doubleth with his Maker, makes show of
honoring and serving him, when he indeed neither honors nor serves him at
all: Simulata sanctitas est duplex iniquitas, counterfeit sanctity is double
iniquity, and accordingly it shall receive double punishment. When our Savior
threateneth the most heinous transgressors, that they shall have their Mat.
24.51.
portion with hypocrites, he implies that the condition of none in Hell is
less tolerable than of the hypocrite. The Psalm. 14.1.
fool has said in his heart there is no God, and even in that he showed
himself the more fool, in that he said it in his heart, supposing that none
should hear it there: whereas God hears the word in the heart, before it be
uttered in the tongue; and what though other know it not, since he whom he
wrongeth, who is best able to revenge it, knows it?

But to wound the Politician with his own sword: If a show and appearance of
Religion is not only profitable, but necessary in politic respects, shall
not Religion it self be much more? Can there be a like virtue or power in the
shadow or image, as in the body it self? If the grapes painted by Zeuxis,
allured the Birds to pecke at them, would not the Birds sooner have flowne at
them, had they been true grapes? All the wit of these sublimated spirits,
wherewith they entangle the honest simplicity of others, cannot wind them out
of these dilemmaes: If it be a bad thing to be good, why do they seem so? If
it be a bad thing to seem bad, why are they bad? For if it be a good thing to
seem good, it cannot but be much better to be so: If it be a bad thing to
seem bad, it cannot but be worse to be so. Videre ergo quod es, vel esto
quod videris, seem therefore what thou art, or be what thou seem:
especially considering, that as Cyr. poed. l. 2.
Astyages in Xenophon wisely advises, the best means to seem learned, is to
be learned; to seem wise, is to be wise; to seem religious, is to be
religious. He that is not so, cannot long seem so; and he that is so, cannot
but seem so. Fraud and guile cannot go long but it will be espied. No
Stage Player can so act another part, but that he may be discerned to be a
player: dissembling will not always be dissembled; and when it is once
detected, it disableth the dissembler from ever after using his cousening trade.

2. It is not to be omitted, that fraud, guile, and deceit bear no fruits of
themselves, but gather them from the honesty and simplicity of others, whom
they circumvent. If all were such as themselves, lying upon the catch, they
would make little advantage of their cheating trade; neither could there be any
true friendship or society among men: and is that the best policy that
overthrows all policy and civil conversation?

3. Lastly, faithfulness and honesty are like natural beauty and strength of
body, which preserve themselves; but all fraudulent and deceitful dealing, and
cunning fetches, like complexion, where nature is much decayed, must be daily
laid on: or like physic potions continually taken, and yet will not long
help. All devices, plots, and fabrickes in the mind for advancing our estate,
which are not built upon the foundation of faithfulness and integrity,
continually need repairing, and upon a strong assault are easily cast down,
and fall upon the builders themselves. It will not be amiss to consider the
ends of some of these men. Of two that were most famous in this politic
craft, Achitophel and Hannibal, the one hanged, the other poisoned himself.
Theramenes, who in the civil dissensions at Athens dealt under hand on all
sides, in the end was discovered, and all parts joining against him, made a
spectacle of misery and scorn. A singular Artificer in this kind, who put
tricks upon all men, was sent for by Lewis the French King, saying, that he
had need of such an head, and when he came to him, upon detection of diverse of
his cunning prankes, he was condemned by him to be beheaded. I should much
wrong Alexander the sixth, and Borgias his son, not to put them in this
Catalogue: for it was the common voice of all men (as Bodin. de rep. sup. cit.
Bodine writes) that the father never spoke what he meant, the son never
did what he spoke: both held it for a Maxim, Fidem omnibus dandam, servandam
nemini. According to which rule, when Borgias the son by fairest promises and
deepest protestations of amity, and burying all former injuries, had drawn in
the Captains of the opposite faction, as soon as he had them in his power,
contrary to all promises and oaths, put them all to death: whereof the Pope
his father having notice, could not conceal his joy, but brake out into that
execrable exclamation, O factum been, Well done, thou art a son after mine
own heart. But he escaped not the heavy judgment of God: for shortly after
having caused a poisonous cup to be tempered for some of the Cardinals, whose
deaths he had vowed, through a mistake he drank off the same cup himself,
and so ended his wretched life.

I seal up this whole discourse with the words of the blessed Apostle; since
all dishonest, false, and unjust courses of thriving are not only disgraceful
and shameful, but also (all things considered) disadvantageous: Finally, Phil.
4.8.
brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any virtue, if there be any
praise, think on these things, and the God of peace shall be with you. To
whom, etc.

THE HIEW OF A SINNER. THE XLIII. SERMON.
ROMANS 6.21. Whereof ye are now ashamed.


Right Honorable, etc.
I Have long dwelt upon this text of Scripture, because I find it richly
stored with spiritual armor, and all necessary provision for our Christian
warfare against sin and Satan. Here we may furnish our selves with those
weapons against our ghostly enemies, that will pierce the strongest proof of
impudency, and draw blood even from a seared conscience. There is none so hardy
and insensible, whom the loss of invaluable treasures will not touch to the
quick: present shame and future infamy wound at the heart, but eternal death
kills outright. In comparison of these all the weapons which Philosophy forgeth
upon the anvile of reason, are but like arrows with blunt heads, or blades
with a soft edge, Irrita tela cadunt. Cic. de Off. c. lib. 3.
The Stoics devised many witty arguments to prove that profit and honesty could
not be severed, and that dishonesty was always joined with disadvantage: but
they were never able to maintain them against infinite examples and instances
every where occurring of sundry sorts of men enriched by spoiling, relieved by
oppressing, absolved by calumniating, advanced by depressing, raised by
undermining others: in a word, building their fortunes upon the ruins of other
men's estates and their own fidelity and honesty. Howbeit it is true that in
their moral considerations they glanced at those very Topickes from whence the
Apostle draws his arguments, the unprofitablenesse of dishonest courses, and
the ill ends of wicked persons. For the more to scare and deter their hearers
from by-ways to honor and wealth, they set before their eyes the penalty of
humane laws, loss of goods and life, with shame and infamy, the peril
whereof they incurred, if they swerved any whit in their actions from the fair
and straight path of virtue, and moral honesty: and the consideration of these
things might be some restraint of outward acts, and open crimes; but no way of
such wickedness as is brought forth in secret, or rather not brought forth at
all, but only conceived in the heart. Mutinous or murmuring thoughts, unchaste
lusts of the heart, ambitious desires, execrable projects and purposes,
treasonable plots, and the like, stood in no awe of man's justice, or fear of
ignominy and shame: the light reproves those things only that are brought to
it, justice must proceed secundum allegata and probata; they are but few
offenses that come within the Magistrates walk, and all that come are not
taken: of those that are taken hold of, the greater part either break away by
force, or escape by favor. If Anacharsis were alive, he would spy 1 Plut.
Apopth. Leges dixit aranearum telis similes.
cobwebbe laws in every Court of justice, in which the lesser flies are
strangled, but the greater easily break through them. And be the laws of any
Commonwealth or Kingdom never so exact, yet Seneca his observation will be
true, Angusta est justitia ad legem justum esse; it is but narrow and scanty
justice which extends no further than man's law. A man may be ill enough, and
yet keep out of the danger of the laws of men, which are many ways imperfect
and defective: but the law of God is no way subject to this imputation; it is
perfect, and, as the Prophet David speaks, Psalm. 119.96
exceeding broad: it reaches to all the actions, words, and imaginations of
all the sons of Adam; not a by syllable can pass, not a thought stray, not a
desire swerve from the right way, but it falls within the danger, and is
liable to the penalties annexed to it, which are most certain and most
grievous: 1 External, in the world. 2 Internal, in the conscience. 3
Eternal, in hell.


The arguments that are hence drawn to deter men from sin and wickedness,
are of a stronger metal, and have another manner of edge than reason can set
upon them: Heb. 4 12.
For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged
sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the
joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
The Hyperbolicall commendation which the Cic. de orat. l. 1. Fremant licet
omnes, dicam quod sentio, bibliothecas omnes Philosophorum unus mihi videtur
duodecim tabularum libellus, si quis legum fontes; and capita viderit, and
autoritatis pondere, and utilitatis ubertate superare.
Orator gives of the Roman laws, published in twelve Tables, of right
belongs to this member of the Apostles exhortation: it has more weight of
reason, and forcible arguments of persuasion to holiness of life, and
detestation of vice in it, than all the discourses of moral Philosophers
extant in the world. Hence we learn, that their losses who trade with Satan are
inestimable and irrecoverable: that wicked and ungodly courses and means to
gain and thrive by, not only deprive us of the comfortable fruition of all
earthly, but also of the possession of all heavenly blessings: that even small
offenses when they come to light are sufficient to cover the sinner with shame
and confusion: that all the filthiness that lies in the skirts of the soul,
shall be discovered in the face of the sun, before men and Angels: that not
only outward acts, but inward motions and intentions; not only loud and crying
sins, but also still and quiet, that lie asleep as it were in the lap of our
conscience; not only heinous crimes, and transgressions of an high nature, but
also those seeming good actions that have any secret filthiness or stain in
them, if it be not washed away with the tears of our repentance, and blood of
our Redeemer, shall be brought into judgment against us, and we for them
condemned to death both of body and soul in hell. No tragical vociferation,
nor the howling and shricking of damned ghosts can sufficiently express the
horror and torments of that endless death, which is the end of sin.

What sin has proved for the time past, ye have heard; we are at this
present to consider what it is for the present: it has been unfruitful, what
fruit had ye? it is shameful, whereof ye are now ashamed.

Shame is defined by L. 2. Rhet. c. 6. (...).
Aristotle, Agriefe and trouble of mind, arising from such evils as seem to
tend to our infamy and disgrace: somewhat more fully it may be described, A
check of conscience condemning us for some intention, speech, or action,
whereby we have defiled our conscience before God, or stained our credits
before men. This affection is in all men, even in those that are shameless and
impudent; who are not so called because they are without this irksome passion,
but because they show no sign thereof in their countenance, nor effects in
their lives. As impossible it is that in the conscience of a sinner Romans 2.15.
thoughts should not arise accusing him, as that there should be a fire
kindled and no sparks fly up. To pollute the conscience with foul sin, and
not to be ashamed, is all one as to prick the tenderest part of the body, and
to feel no pain. Suet. in Tib.
Tiberius, who let loose the raines to all licentiousness, yet when he gave
himself to his impure pleasures, caused all the pictures to be removed out of
the room: and Alexander Phereus that cruel tyrant, when he beheld a bloody
Tragedy in the Theater, and therein the ugly and monstrous image of his
barbarous cruelty drawn to the life, was so confounded therewith, that he
could no longer dissemble his terror of mind, nor expect the end of that
dismal Scene.

Now how deep an impression shame and infamy make in the soul, we may
perceive by those who preferred death before it. Xen. l. 7. Cyr. Paed. (...).
Panthea solemnly wished that she might be buried alive, rather than
constrained to stain her blood and good name, by keeping company with any, how
great soever he were, contrary to her vow to her dearest Abradatus. And Ovid.
Epist. Phillis Demophoonti.
Phillis having lost her honor, voweth to make amends for it by her voluntary
death. Stat necis electu tenerum pensare pudorem. Which Lucretia also
practiced, flying out of the world to shun the shame thereof, and spilling her
blood which the tyrant had a little before stained: and Europa thought one
death too light a revenge for wronged chastity; Levis una mors est
Virginum culpae.


If shame and infamy were not the sharpest corrasives to a guilty conscience,
the Prophet David would not so often use these and the like imprecations against
the enemies of God: Let them be confounded and perish that are Psalm. 71.11. and
83.17.
against my soul: and, let them be counfounded and vexed evermore, let them
be put to shame and perish, let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and
let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a cloak.

Yea but if shame and confusion are the very gall and wormwood of Gods
vengeance against the wicked, most bitter to the taste of the soul; what
construction are we to make of those words of the Prophet, Ezekiel. 36.32
O ye house of Israel, be ashamed and confounded for your own ways? does
the Prophet here give them counsel to pull down Gods vengeance upon
themselves? Nothing less. To clear this point therefore we must distinguish
of shame; which is taken

1 Sometimes for a virtuous habit and disposition of the mind, consisting in a
mediocrity between two extremes; impudency in the defect, reproved in the
Jews by the Prophet Jer. 8.12.
Jeremy (were they ashamed when they committed abominations? nay they were not
ashamed, neither could they blush:) and bashfulnesse, or rather cowardice, in
the excess, reproved by our Savior in white livered professors; Luke 9.26.
Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the son of
man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory, and in his fathers, and
of the holy Angels.

2 Sometimes for a perturbation of the mind, or irksome passion, when our
hearts smite us for some grievous sin, wherewith we are confounded within
our selves; and with holy Job 42.6. Wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in
dust and ashes.
Job, even abhor our selves for the time.

3 Sometimes it is taken for infamy and public disgrace, when a man is made
Zeph. 3.19.
a spectacle of shame and derision to others.

According to the first signification, men are said to be modest or shamefaced;
according to the second, ashamed and confounded in themselves; according to the
third, shamed, or put to shame, or branded with a note of infamy and shame.
Shame in the first acception is the curb of sin, in the second the sense and
smart of sin, in the third the scourge of sin: shame in the first sense is
in us by nature, and grows more and more by custom, and is improved by the
grace of humility: in the second it is brought to us by sin; for as smoke
sutteth, so sin blacketh, soyleth, and shameth the soul: in the third sense
men are brought to it by justice, according to the words of the Psalm. 40.14.
Psalmist, Let them be brought to shame. When the Apostle says, that Ephesians.
5.12.
it is a shame to name those things that are done by impure persons in secret,
he takes shame in the first sense, and his meaning is, the things they do in
secret are so foul, so unnatural, so abominable, that a modest or shamefaced
man cannot endure to hear of them, much less to rip them up and relate them,
with all their odious circumstances. But when Ezra prays in these words, Ezra
9.6.
O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our
iniquities are increased over our heads, and our trespasses are grown up to
the heavens; he takes shame in the second sense. Lastly, when the Prophets
threaten sinners with shame, or by imprecations wish it unto them, they take
shame in the third acception: Hab. 2.10.11
Thou have consulted shame to thine own house, by cutting off many people, and
have sinned against thy soul: for the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the
beam out of the timber shall answer it; that is, thou have taken a course, and
advisedly studied how to bring ruin, shame, and disgrace upon thy self. Nah.
3.5.
Behold, I come upon thee, says the Lord of hosts, and I will discover thy
skirts upon thy face, and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the
kingdoms thy shame: that is, I will expose thee unto ignominy and disgrace, as
the Prophet there expounds himself; Verse 6.
I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and set thee at a
gazing stock.

In this place the Apostle evidently takes the word in the second sense: What
fruit had ye in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? that is, for which
you now condemn your selves, and seem filthy and abominable in your own
eyes. This shame, though it come always from evil, yet good may come of it,
if we seriously consider what brought this shame and confusion upon us, and
turn our anger upon it which set us at odds with our selves: and to this end
the Prophet Ezekiel endeavors to stir up this perturbation, or troublous
passion in the Jews; Ezekiel. 36.32.
O ye house of Israel, be ashamed and confounded for your ways; that is,
consider your own follies, give glory to God, and take shame to your selves;
abhor your selves for those sins, for which ye have made God to abhor
you. Shame in this sense may be a means to keep us from shame in the third
signification, and everlasting confusion: for though shame be always a sign
of evil past or present, yet it is not always an evil sign, but oftentimes
a sign of grace. I cannot hold altogether with him in the Poet, who seeing a
young man dye his cheeks with the tincture of virtue, said, Terent.
Erubuit, salva res est: he has blushed, all is well; yet with a little
alteration the speech may pass, Erubuit, salutis spes est; he has blushed,
therefore there is hope all may be well. For so it comes to pass in our
inward conflicts with sin, as in the skirmishes with outward enemies in the
field; though the battle go sore against us, and we lose both ground and men,
yet till the colors and ensigns be taken by the enemy, the fight holds out,
and there may be hope of better success: but when the colors and ensigns are
lost, we give the battle for gone. Now the colors of virtue displayed by
nature in the countenance, appear in the blushes of shame and modesty: while
these are to be seen, though we give ground to Satan, and lose many other
gifts and graces, yet there may be some hope of victory; but when Satan has
taken our colors, and custom of sinning has taken away all sense of sin,
and blush of shame, our case grows desperate, and without new aides and
supply of graces from heaven, it is impossible to keep our standing, much
less recover our losses. As nothing is more to be grieved for than for this,
that we cannot grieve for sin; so ought we to be ashamed of nothing more
than of this, that we are not ashamed of all finfull and shameful actions.
Shame is the strongest bar which nature has set before our unruly lusts and
desires, and if it be removed, nothing can keep them within compass.

Ye are ashamed. The godly and wicked are both ashamed, sin affects them
both with the like malady, but they both apply not the like remedy: the godly
seek to pluck out the sting, that is, sin in the conscience, which causes
all their anguish and pain; but the ungodly and wicked liver endeavors
only to dead the flesh, and thereby assuage the pain for the present, leaving
the sting of death in their soul, sin festring in their conscience. The one
abstaineth from sin, that he may avoid the shame of it; the other
accustometh himself to it, that he may be less sensible of it: he hardens
his brow, and makes it in the end of that metal, that it will not yield, or
change hiew. He is like to him, that going into the water, and finding it
extreme cold by lightly touching it with the soles of his feet, casts
himself suddenly into the river, and plungeth himself over head and ears,
that he may be less sensible of the frigiditie of that element: so this hardy
sinner finding himself confounded at lesser sins, throws himself headlong
into greater, that he may be the sooner past all shame.

Ye. To whom does Saint Paul address his speech? to those whose loathsome
sores were upon them, or to those who had washed them in the laver of
regeneration, and now were clean and sound? Surely to the latter, as appears
by the words ensuing: But now ye have your fruit in holiness. Notwithstanding
these (though free from the guilt of sin, yet) are not freed from the shame
of it: Whereof (says he) ye are now ashamed. For as in the finest cloth and
stuff, after the spot is taken out, there remains some stain: and as in the
flesh of a man hurt, after the wound is cured, there remains some scarre; so
though the spot of our sins be washed out, and the wounds of our conscience
cured, yet there remains somewhat like a scarre or stain, defacing the image
of God in us, which when the soul beholds, she is ashamed of her self. All
other evils which sin brings, are in some sort curable: the fire of Gods
wrath kindled against us may be quenched by the tears of our repentance: the
anguish of conscience may be assuaged by the balm of Gilead: the breach of
charity may be made up by satisfaction to the party whom we have wronged, and
unfeigned reconciliation: only the shame of sin, and the stain of our
reputation and credit, can never be got out: Haec macula nec sanguine eluitur,
our winding sheet which covers our bodies, covers not our shame; neither is
our infamy buried in our grave with us.

1. Now ashamed. Now after the commission of sin, or now after your
conversion unto God. It is with all of us, as it was with our first Parent in
Paradise; we first taste the forbidden fruit of sin, Genesis 3.10.
and then see our nakedness, and are ashamed. We are now ashamed of those
sins whereof we were not ashamed when we committed them. What? Does sin
then clear the sight of the mind, and enlighten it with knowledge, because we
see more in sin after we have committed it? Nay, rather sin darkneth the
understanding, and puts out the eyes of the mind. Surely Adam got no
knowledge by eating the forbidden fruit, but lost by it, as all we his
posterity find by our palpable ignorance in those things which most concern
us. Why then was the tree of the fruit whereof he tasted, called the tree of
knowledge of good and evil? Because thereby Adam came to experience and
feeling of the good he lost, and the evil he brought upon himself and his
posterity: as the horse may be said to know the lash or spur, and a child
the rod, when they feel the smart and pain of them. If this be true, that
sin rather infatuateth a sinner, than any way instructs him, or increases
his knowledge; how comes it then to pass, that sin present should not
work much more shame and confusion upon us, than when it is past? that we
should not discover the deformity and loathsomenesse of pleasures as they are
coming to us, but as they are going from us? Whence is that Latin Proverb,
Voluptates intuere abeuntes, non venientes? Why? do they come unto us naked,
and put off their masks when they take their leave of us? Nay, rather our
eyes are shut when they come to us, and they are open when they go from us:
or, to speak more plainly, when they come toward us, and our desires run to
meet them, we contemplate only that which is amiable and lovely in them, we
take no notice of the turpitude and deformity in them: not but that we might
see it also if we would, but that we are not willing to look that way, lest
the sight of that which is filthy and nasty in them, should mar our mirth,
and interrupt our pleasure. The ignorance of an incontinent man is not like the
blindness of Regulus, which was forced; but of Oedipus, who pulled out his
own eyes. Aristotle in this point saw daylight as it were at a chinke, when
propounding this question, Utrum scientia sit in incontinente? whether an
incontinent man has knowledge of what he does? resolves it thus: An Arist
Eth. lib. 7. c. 5.
incontinent man has a general knowledge, and a confused notion, that
incontinency is many ways hurtful and prejudicial to him; but not a
particular knowledge, that the action or pleasure wherewith he is then taken is
of that nature. Why may not the particular be deduced out of the general? It
may, but he will not deduce it; he is not at leisure to enter so far into the
point, his heart is possessed with the present pleasure, which his sense
thirsts after, and all his thoughts and affections are set upon it; so that
for the present he cannot, or will not withdraw his mind from the delightful
object before him, to look behind him, and consider the danger he incurreth:
like beasts that are drawn by the sweet smell of the Panther, but never take
notice of his ougly head, before he turn upon them and devour them: But after
the intemperate person has taken his fill of sinful pleasure, he is at
leisure to bethink himself what he has done. Reason in the natural man, and
the Spirit of God in the regenerate Christian, blows the coal of knowledge
within him, which lay hid under the ashes; and by the light thereof he sees
what manner of guests he has entertained, and how they have soyled and
slubbered his inward rooms, and made them most filthy and loathsome. The Plin.
not. hist. l. 10. c. 4. Aquilae cum Cervis praelia sunt, multum pulve rem
volutatu collectum, insidens cornibus ex^ utit in oculos pennis ora verberans,
donec praecipitet in rupes, etc.
Eagle, before he sets upon the Heart, rolleth himself in the sand, and then
flies at the Stagges head, and by fluttering his wings so dustieth his eyes
that he can see nothing, and then strikes him with his talons where he
lists. Beloved, ye have heard of the unclean spirit in the Gospel, which
led the possessed man into Mat. 12.43.
dry places: the sand and dust, with which this Eagle fills his wings, are
earthly desires and sensual pleasures, wherewith after he has put out the
eyes of the carnal man, he deals with him as he lists. Mercury could not
kill Argus till he had cast him into a sleep, and with an enchanted rod closed
his hundred eyes. The Devil so tempereth the poisoned cup, which he offers
to the voluptuous person, that he feels nothing in the going down of it but
sweetness: but after he has swallowed down his draught, he feels a fire
kindled within his bowels, and unless he take suddenly a great quantity of
heavenly balsamum, it proves the bane of his soul.

2 Now ye are ashamed. After your conversion and renovation, now God has
anointed your eyes with the Apoc. 3.18.
eye salve of the Spirit, and ye discover the works of darkness, and clearly
see the filthiness of your former unregenerate estate, ye are now ashamed. For
now ye have some sense of the wrath of God, ye have some remorse of conscience,
ye perceive what ye have lost, ye see the mark of infamy burnt into your name
and credit by the hot iron that has scared your consciences.

To proceed from farther explication to a seasonable use and application. The
Apothecaries draw an oil out of the Scorpion which overcommeth the poison of
that Serpent, and applied to the part that is stung, gives present ease. Let
us imitate them, and of that which issues from sin, make a sovereign antidote
against it. Let us lay open and naked before the eyes of our mind the loathsome
filthiness and ougly deformity thereof, that being agashed and confounded
thereat, we may turn away from it with greatest detestation. Let us apprehend
thoroughly, as heretofore the unfruitfulnesse, so now the odiousness,
loathsomenesse, turpitude, and shame of sin. A lewd conceit is an
unconceivable pollution, a profane or impure speech an unspeakable wrong to
God, a sudden joy a lasting grief, a tickling of the sense for a moment a
perpetual torment, with a scar in the conscience, and stain in our good name,
never to be fetched out. The advice which Epist. 11. Aliquis vir bonus nobis
eligendus est, and semper ante oculos habendus, ut sic tanquam illo spectante
vivamus, etc.
Seneca gives to Lucilius, very sage and good: Wheresover thou art, and
whatsoever thou art about, suppose that Cato or Socrates is with thee, or some
such other reverend or grave personage, before whom thou would be ashamed to
do any thing that were unseemly. Beloved Christians, we need not feign to
our selves, or make in our thoughts an imaginary presence of any mortal man,
were he never so venerable, grave, or austere: for we are always in the
presence of our Judge. Hesiod. op. and dies l. 1. (...).
Wheresoever we are, whatsoever we go about, we have a thousand witnesses
thereof within us, and the blessed Angels without us; and, which we are to
take special notice of, malignant spirits our ghostly enemies, observers and
noters thereof. They who tender their credit and estimation, says the Arist.
l. 2. Rhetor.
Oracle of reason, if they imbarke themselves into any dangerous or
questionable action, most of all shun and avoid the company of Poets,
Stage Players, Libellers, Registers, Notaries, Promoters, and the like: because
if any thing should be done amiss, these kind of men were like to blab it
out, act it upon the stage, or make a byword of it to their utter disgrace.
Such we have always about us, when we are about any wickedness, I mean the
accusers of the brethren, fiends of Hell, who keep a register of all our secret
and open sins, wherewith they will often upbraid us in our life, grievously
burden us with them at our death, and which is worst of all, rip them up all
at the day of judgment, and insult upon us for them. No women among the
Romans might under a great penalty prostitute their bodies for gain, except
they first made open profession thereof before the Aediles: and the reason of
this law was, because they thought the very shame of making open profession of
such lewdness, would deter and keep back all of that sex from such infamous
courses of life. Likewise I read in the ancient Greek stories of the Milesian
women, that upon some discontent, diverse of them laid violent hands upon
themselves, and could not be restrained from this desperate practice, till a
law was made, that all they that in such sort made away themselves, should be
carried naked with a halter about their necks, before the rest of their sex:
after which law none were sound to attempt the like villainy. Those with whom
neither love of life, nor fear of death could prevail, shame yet manicled,
and kept perforce from that unnatural and execrable crime of felony de se, or
selfe-homicide.

Dear Christians, were Adam and Eve so ashamed to see the nakedness of their
bodies, and the Milesian women to behold the naked carcasses of their sex? how
then shall we be confounded with shame, when our souls and consciences shall
be laid open and naked to the eyes of the whole world? that all may see all our
deformities, sores, marks, botches, blanes, gashes, scarres, spots, and
abominable pollutions and uncleanness? When a godly father amplifying upon
that Text of the Apostle, We must all appear before the judgment seat of
Christ, pricked the veins of his auditory in this manner: How many things are
there which we know by our selves, but would not for all the world, that two or
three should know as much besides? how then shall we look? how shall we be
covered with shame and confusion, when all these things shall be laid out
before the eyes of all men? At these words observing diverse of his hearers to
blush, and hide their faces, he thus grows upon them, Nunquid? nunc
erubescitit? What? and do ye now blush? are ye now ashamed at the hearing of
these things? what will ye be when ye see them? how will ye blush and hang
down your heads, when the books of your consciences shall be opened, and men
and Angels shall see and read what is written in them? Men and brethren, what
shall we do to avoid the terror and horror, the shame and confusion of that
day? Let us now be ashamed of our sins, that we may not then be: for as Dolor
est medicina doloris, So Pudor est medicina pudoris. O let us not cast more
blots upon the book of our conscience, but rather fetch out those which are
there with the aqua fortis of our tears: let us open our wounds and sores full
of corruption to our heavenly Chirurgian, by confession of our sins, that he
may heal them: let us make uncessant prayers to our Savior, Psalm. 32.1.
to cover all our imperfections with the robes of his righteousness; so shall
we be truly blessed. For blessed are they whose unrighteousness is forgiven,
and whose sins are covered from the sight of the world, that they shame them
not; from the sight of their consciences, that they confound them not; from the
eyes of God, that they condemn them not. God the Father make us all so
blessed, for the merits of his Son, through the powerful operation of the
Spirit; to whom, three persons, and one God, be ascribed, etc. Amen.

THE WAGES OF SIN. THE XLIV. SERMON.
ROMANS 6.21. For the end of those things is death.


Right Honorable, etc.
TO every thing there is a season, Eccles. 3.1, 2, 3, 4.
and a time to every purpose under heaven. A time to be borne, and a time to
dye: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted. A time to
kill, and a time to heal: a time to break down, and a time to build up. A
time to weep, and a time to laugh: a time to mourn, and a time to dance, etc.
In which distribution of time, according to the several affairs of our life,
all actions and accidents, all intents and events, all counsels and acts, all
words and works, all motions and cessations, businesses and recreations,
beginnings and endings, inchoations and perfections: yea, affections also, as
joy and grief, love and hatred, have some part and portion of time laid out
for them; sin only is exempted, that is never in season. As the Apostle spoke
to Simon Acts 8.21.
Magus, Non est tibi pars, neque sors: it has neither part nor lot in this
partition; and yet it intrudeth upon us, and usurpeth upon either the whole or
the greatest part of our demised time. We hear of a time to build, and a time
to pull down: a time to spare, and a time to spend; but not in like manner a
time to do good, and a time to do ill: a time to live godly, and a time to
sin: a time well to employ, and a time to mispend: neither God nor Nature
has bequeathed any legacy of time to sin. Sin should have no existence at
all, and therefore no time: no estate, and therefore neither term. Sin is
none of Gods creatures, nor the issue of nature: therefore has no just claim
or title to time, the best of Natures temporal goods; much less to happy
eternity, which is the purchase of the Son of God, to the price whereof
Nature cannot come near. Moreover, sin mis-spendeth, spoyleth, makes
havocke of our time, abridgeth it, and often cutteth it off: and therefore
deserves, that not a moment of time should be given to it. Will you have yet
more reasons? ye have them in the Text, drawn from all the differences of
time: sin has been unfruitful, is shameful, and will prove pernicious and
deadly; therefore no portion or part of time is to be allowed to it, against
which all times give in evidence. The time past brings in against it all sorts
of damages and losses sustained by it: (What fruit had ye?) The present time
lays open the shame and filthiness of sin: (Whereof ye are now ashamed.)
The future produces the great and grievous penalties, which the sinner by the
breach of the eternal Law incurreth, (The end of those things is death.)

A wise man holds intelligence with the time past by memory, with the present
by prudent circumspection, with the time to come by providence: by re-calling
that which was, and fore-casting what will be, he orders that which is; and
therefore he cannot but be sufficiently advertised of those heinous and
grievous imputations laid upon sin by the Spirit of God in my Text. It is
altogether unfruitful and unprofitable, good for nothing: What fruit had ye?
It is shameful and infamous, Whereof ye are now ashamed. Nay, it is pestilent
and pernicious: For the end of those things is death. If this forcible
interrogatory of the Apostle, so full of spirit of persuasion, work not in us
newness of life, and a detestation of our former sinful courses, we are not
only insensible of our profit, prodigal of our credit and reputation, but also
altogether careless of our life. Nihili est, says the Plaut. in Pers. Certe
nihili est qui nihil amat: quid ei homini opus est vita?
Poet, qui nihil amat, he is of no account, who makes account of nothing: Non
spirat, qui non aspirat, he breathes not, who gaspeth not after something. What
then is that ye desire? How bestow ye your affections? What object has the
command of your thoughts, and sovereignty over your wills and desires? Is it
gain, wealth, and affluence of all things? fly then sin: for it is
altogether unfruitful and unprofitable. Is it glory, honor, and reputation?
eschew then vice: for it brings shame and infamy upon you and your posterity.
Is it long life? nay, with Melchizedek to have no end of your days? abandon
all wicked courses: for they have an end, and that end is death, and that death
has no end.

That sin is unfruitful, not only formaliter, but also effective, not only
negatively, by bringing forth no fruit, but also positively, by bringing forth
evil and corrupt fruit, by making the soul of man barren of the fruits of
righteousness, yea, and the earth also and trees barren of the fruit which
they would otherwise have brought forth to our great joy and comfort; has been
the subject of our former discourses, spent especially in the proof of these
particulars: That sin eclipseth the light of our understanding, disordereth
the desires of the will, weakneth the faculties of the soul, distempereth the
organs of our body, disturbeth the peace of our conscience, choaketh the
motions of the spirit in us, kills the fruits of grace, inthralleth the soul
to the body, and the body and soul to Satan; lastly, depriveth us of the
comfortable fruition of all temporal, and the fruition and possessions of all
eternal blessings. All which laid together will make a weighty argument,
bearing down, and forcing our assent to this conclusion, That sin is sterill
and barren: and consequently, that every sinner is an unthrift, and in the end
will prove bank-rupt, how gainful a trade soever he seem to drive with
Satan: for as Christ cursed the fig tree in the Gospel, so God curses all
trees that bear the forbidden fruit of sin; and therefore the Apostle truly
terms the works of darkness unfruitful, saying, Ephesians. 5.11.
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but reprove them
rather. The godly man whose delight is in the law of the Lord, is likened Psalm.
1.3, 4.
to a tree planted by the rivers of waters, which brings forth fruit in due
season: but the wicked to chafe which the wind scatters abroad. For
although they may sometimes build palaces upon the ruins of the Church, and
fill their houses with the treasures of wickedness, and their coffers with the
Mammon of unrighteousness, yet in the end they will appear to be no gainers,
no nor savers neither by their traffic with the Devil. For if they gain
wealth, they lose grace; if they gain glass, they lose pearl; if they gain
earth, they lose heaven; if they gain an estate for term of years among
sinners, they lose an eternal inheritance with the Saints in light; if they
gain a small portion of the world, they Mar. 8.36.
lose their whole soul: and what advantageth it a man to gain the whole
world, and to lose his own soul? Alas, what gained Josh. 7.25.
Achan by his Babylonish garment, and wedge of gold? nothing but a heap of
stones wherewith he was battered in pieces. What gained Gehezi 2 Kin. 5.27.
by his great bribe? a leprosy, that cleaved to him and his posterity after
him. What gained Judge. 8.27.
Zeba and Zalmunna by taking the houses of God in their own possession? a
fearful and most shameful end. What gained 1 Kin. 22.31. 2 Kin. 9.33.
Ahab and Jezabel by Naboths vineyard? the vine of Sodom, and the grapes of
Gomorrah; it cost them their lives and their kingdoms. What gained Dan. 5.28.
Balthazar by the plate of the Temple? the division of his crown between the
Medes and Persians. What gained Act. 5.5, 10.
Ananias and Sapphira by their fraudulent keeping back part of the price for
which they sold their possessions? a sudden and most fearful death. What
gained Mat. 27.5.
Judas by his thirty pieces of silver, which he received to betray innocent
blood? a halter to hang himself. As Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 4.19.
this dream be to the Kings enemies; so I will be bold to say, such gain as
is made by commerce with Satan be to Gods enemies. Godliness has the promises
of this life, and the life to come, ungodliness of neither, but contrariwise
threats of judgments in both; which sometimes fall upon the estate of those
that are rich, and not in God; sometimes upon their bodies, but always upon
their souls: either God suddenly blows them away from their great estates,
or he blows upon their estates and the fruits of their labors, and they
subscribe probatum est to the Latin proverbs: Male part a male dilabuntur; and
De male quaesitis non gaudet tertius haeres: ill gotten goods prosper not. The
officers whom Suet. in Vesp.
Vespasian employed like spunges to suck in the blood of the subjects, he
after they were full squiezed them till they were dry. And how often do we see
the great spoylers of others spoiled themselves? and the secret underminers of
other men's fortunes undermined themselves? the cruellest exacters upon their
tenants exacted upon by their superior Lords?

In the second place I treated of the second attribute or consequent of sin,
shame; and by evidence of Scripture, and testimony of every ones conscience
proved that sin shameth us three manner of ways: 1 Within our selves, making
us seem most vile, filthy, loathsome and odious to our selves. 2 In the world,
staining our credit, and branding us with a note of infamy. 3 At the tribunal
of Christ, before God, Angels and men, when our consciences, which now like a
scrole of parchment lie folded together, shall be opened and spread abroad,
that all men may read what is written there. If the consideration of the
unfruitfulnesse and shame of sin affect us not much, nor make any sensible
alteration in our lives and conversations, behold yet stronger physic which
will work with us if we be not dead already:


The end of those things is death. Here are three bitter pills that are to be
taken by all them that surfeit in sinful pleasures and worldly vanities,
whether they be lusts of the flesh, or lusts of the eye, or appertain to the
pride of life. 1 These things will have an end, The end. 2 The end of these
things is fearful, Death. 3 This death is the second death, and has no end.


I see, says David, Psalm. 119.96
that all things come to an end: but thy commandments are exceeding broad, yea
so broad, that all ways and courses besides the path of Gods laws, come to a
speedy end, and very short period. What the Historian observed concerning the
race of men, Vita hominum brevit, principum brevior, pontificum brevissima;
that the life of man is shorter than of other creatures, of Princes than of
other men, of Popes than of Princes; may be applied thus to our present
purpose: The lives of men are but short, their actions and endeavors of a
shorter date, but indirect and sinful courses of the shortest duration of all.
All the fruit that comes of them, like the fig tree cursed by our Savior,
withers suddenly. Crassus enjoyed not long the fruit of his covetousness, but
was slain in war, and had melted gold poured into his mouth by the Parthians:
Julius Caesar enjoyed not long the fruit of his ambition, but was stabbed with
twenty five wounds in the Senate: Heliogabalus enjoyed not long the fruit of
his pleasure, but was slain and thrown into a jakes: Dionysius enjoyed not
long the fruit of his sacrilege and tyranny, but was constrained to change
his scepter for a ferular, and teach Scholars for a small stipend, to keep him
from starving. If the prosperity of the wicked be an eyesore unto us, as it
was sometimes unto David, Psalm. 73.17, 18, 19.
Let us enter into the sanctuary of God, and we shall see the end of these
men; namely, that God does set them in slippery places, and casts them down
to destruction. How are they brought into desolation as in a moment? they are
utterly consumed with terrors. Achan spent not his wedge of gold, nor ware out
his Babylonish garment, but was soon discovered, and stripped of all he had,
and came to a fearful end. It was not long after Ahab and Jezabel purchased a
vineyard at the dear rate of the blood of the owner, but they watered it with
their own blood. Belshazzar had scarce concocted the wine in his stomach,
which he carowsed in the bowls of the Sanctuary, before he saw a hand
writing his doom on the wall, and soon after felt the arm of Cyrus executing
it upon him. Achitophel his policy took not long, for within a short space
after he had animated the son against the father, his counsel was rejected,
and he hanged himself. The price of innocent blood was not long in Judas his
hands before with the same hands he fitted his own halter. Titus exhibited to
the people stately pageants, pompes, carosels, and triumphant festivities for
an hundred days; Asuerus kept royal feasts for half a year together: of
both after the prefixed term was expired, nothing remained but infinite spoil
of Gods creatures, and an excessive bill of charge. He that thriveth most by
sinful courses, and gurmandizeth all sorts of pleasures, and keeps
continual holy days a great part of his life; yet before he goes out of the
light of this world, sees an end of all his worldly happiness, and there
remains nothing unto him but a sad remembrance, distempers in his body, wounds
in his conscience, and a fearful account to be given to his Lord and Master
for thus lavishing out his goods, and wasting his substance in riotous living.
Pleasures like blossoms soon fall, the garlands of honor are withered in a
few years, the treasures of wickedness soon rust, all lewd and sensual, all
base and covetous, all proud and ambitious, all false and deceitful ways have
a short period, and a downfall into a lake that burns with fire and brimstone.

In ep. ad Romans Servitutis culpae triplex est incommoditas, primo quia cum
damno multo, secundo quia cum fructu nullo, tertio quia cum fine malo.
Gorrhan summeth up all briefly thus: There is a threefold inconvenience of
sinful courses; because they who pursue them reap no fruit from them,
sustain much loss by them, come to an evil end through them: for the

End. The end is taken 1 Either physically, 2 Or morally.
Either for the final cause, or for the final effect. Death is not the final
cause of sin, but the final effect: for no man sins for death, but dies
for sin. Others distinguish of ends, which are, 1 Intermediate, as wealth,
honor, or pleasure. 2 Ultimate, as happiness.
Death, say they, is not the intermediate end, but profit or delight; but it is
always the ultimate end of sin unrepented of. A third sort make a difference
between the end, 1 Peccantis, of the sinner, that is, the end which the sinner
intends. 2 Peccati, of sin, that is, the end to which sin tends: this
distinction seems to me coincident with the first.
Death, say they, is not the end of the sinner, but of the sin; not the end
which the sinner propounds to himself, but the end which his sin brings
him unto. Withal they acutely observe, that the Apostle says not, the end of
those men is death, but the end

Of those things. By those things he understands the state of the
unregenerate, or those sins which were rife among the Romans, and are
reckoned up, chap. 1. which may be reduced to three heads: 1 Impiety against
God. 2 Iniquity against their neighbors. 3 Impurity against their own body
and soul, yea and against nature also.
1 Impiety; with this he brandeth them ( verse. 21.) 2 Iniquity; with this he
charge them ( verse. 29.) 3 Impurity; with this he shameth them ( verse. 24,
27.) Of those things the end is


Death. The second death, say some; for he that has no part in the first
resurrection, has his portion in the second death. A double death, says Saint
Ambrose, a morte enim ad mortem transitur, for a sinner from one death passes
to another. Others more fully thus: The end of those things is death, 1 Of your
estate, by ruin of your fortunes. 2 Of your good name, by tainting your
reputation. 3 Of your body, by separation from the soul. 4 Of your soul, by
separation from God.


The most natural interpretation, and most agreeable to this place, is, That
by continuing in a sinful course all our life, we incur the sentence,
penalty and torment of eternal death: for that death is meant here which is
opposed to eternal life, Verse. 23. which can be no other than eternal.

Yea, but is sin in general so strong a poison, that the least quantity of
it brings death, and that eternal? are all sins mortal, that is, in their
own nature deserving eternal death? It seems so, for he speaks
indefinitely, and without any limitation; and as before he employed all sin
to be unfruitful and shameful, so also now to be deadly. What fruit had ye
in those things, that is, in any of those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
Now it is certain that the regenerate are ashamed of all sins, therefore in
like manner it follows that the end of all sins is death. For the Apostle
here compares the state of sin and state of grace in general; and as he
exhorts to all good works, so he endeavors to beat down all sin, as
unfruitful, shameful, and deadly. See what will ensue hereupon; first, that
there are no venial sins; secondly, no pardons for them in purgatory;
thirdly, no fee for pardons. If all sins are mortal, and, which all Papists
will they nill they must confess, no man is free from all sin; for, Jam. 3.^.
in many things we offend all, says Saint James; and, 1 John 1.10.
if we say that we have no sin we deceive our selves, says Saint John: what
will become of their Romish doctrines concerning the possibility of fulfilling
the law, the merit of congruity or condignity, and works of supererogation? Si
nulla peccata venialia nulla venalia, if no sins are venial, then no sale to
be made of sins, no utterance of pardons, no use of the Church treasury, no
gold to be got by the Monks new found Alchymy. Ye will say, this is but a
flourish, let us therefore come to the sharp: Mitte hebetes gladios, pugnetur
acutis. The speech of Cornelius Celsus the Physician is much commended by
Bodine; Nec aegrotorum morbi, nec languentium vulnera dicendi luminibus
curantur; Soft words cure no wounds: we may say more truly, soft words give
no wounds, and therefore are not for this service of truth against error and
heresy up in arms against her. Hom. Il. (...).
Hector truly told Paris, that his golden harp, and purfled hair, and
beautiful painting, would stand him in no stead in the Sen. ep. 51. In primo
deficit pulvere, ille unctus et nitidus.
field: it is not the wrought scabbard, but the strong blade; nor the bright
color, but the sharp edge of it, that helps in danger, and hurts the
enemy. In which regard I hold it fittest to handle school points
scholastically, in terms rather significant than elegant, and labor more for
force of argument than ornaments of speech. First then, after their plain
method, I will explicate the state of the question; next, meet with the
adversaries objections; and last of all, produce arguments for the truth, and
make them good against all contrary cavils, and frivolous exceptions.

Sins may be termed venial or mortal two manner of ways: 1 Either
comparate, in comparison of others: 2 Or simpliciter, simply, and in
themselves: and that three manner of ways: Either
1 Ex naturasua, of their own nature. 2 Ex gratia, by favor or indulgence. 3
Ex eventu, in the issue or event.
We deny not but that sins may be termed venial comparate, that is, more
venial than others; and if not deserving favor and pardon, yet less
deserving punishment than others. Secondly, venial ex eventu or in the issue
we acknowledge all the sins of the Elect to be; and some sins of the
Reprobate also; or venial ex gratia, that is, by Gods favor and clemency: all
the question is, whether any sin of the Elect or Reprobate be venial ex sua
natura, that is, such as in its own nature deserves not the punishment of
death, but either no punishment at all, or at least temporary only. The
reformed Churches generally resolve, that all sins in their own nature are
mortal; the Bellar. de amiss. great. and stat. pec. c. 9. Qui dixerit, fatue,
reus erit gehennae ignis: ex his tale conficitur argumentum, manifestum
convitium facit reum gehennae ignis, non item subita iracundia, etc.
Romanists will have very many to be venial. Their allegations are chiefly
these: the first out of Matthew 5.22. Whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to
his brother Racha, shall be in danger of the Council: but whosoever shall
say, thou Fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. Here, say they, we may see
that there are two punishments less than hell fire, and that he only is in
danger of it, who breaks out into that outrage, to rail at his brothet, and
call him fool; not he who is unadvisedly angry. Whereupon they infer, that
the last of the three sins mentioned by our Savior, is mortal, not the two
former.

Their second allegation is out of Mat. 7.5. Moat out of thy brothers eye.
Matthew. 7. and Luke 6.41.
Luke 6. and 1 Cor. 3. and such other texts of Scriptures, in which some sins
are compared to very light things, as to 1 Cor. 3.12. Hay and stubble.
hay, to stubble, to a moat, to a Mat. 5.26. The uttermost farthing.
farthing. Surely, say they, they cannot be grievous and weighty sins, which
are compared to such light or vile things of no value.

Their third allegation is out of Saint James, Jam. 1.15.
Sin when it is finished brings forth death: Mark, say they, not every
sin, nor sin in every degree, but when it is come to its perfection
brings forth death; whereby he insinuates, that no sins are mortal but
those which are consummate, brought into act, and committed with full consent
of the will.

The fourth is out of Mat. 12.36.
Matthew. 12. I say unto you, ye shall give an account for every idle word at
the day of judgment. He says not, we shall be condemned for every idle
word, but only that we shall be called to answer for it, as we shall be
for all sins.

Theologia parabolica non est argumentativa. Now that which our Savior here
speaks of three several punishments, is spoken by allusion to the
proceedings in the Civil Courts in Judaea; and all that can be gathered from
thence is but this, That as there are differences of sins, so there shall be
differences of punishments hereafter. Secondly, hell fire is no more properly
taken for the torment of the damned, than the other two, the danger of the
Council, and of Judgment, which all confess to be taken figuratively and
analogically. Thirdly, Maldonate the Jesuit ingenuously confesses, that by
Council and Judgment the eternal death of the soul is understood; yet with
this difference, that a less degree of torment in hell is understood by the
word Judgment than Council; and a less by Council than by gehenna ignis,
that is, the fire in the valley of Hinnom.

light, and to have the like proportion to more grievous sins, as a moat in
the eye has to a beam, a farthing to a pound; yet that no sin committed
against God may be simply termed light, but like the talent of lead mentioned
Zech. 1.5. Whereupon Saint Super Ezekiel. l. 2. Omne peccatum grave est.
Gregory infers, Every sin is heavy and ponderous: and Saint Jer.
Epitaph. Paulae. Ita levia peccata deflebat, ut gravissimotum scelerum diceres
ream. Et ep. 14. Nescio an possemus leve aliquod peccatum dicere, quod in Dei
contemptum admittitur.
Jerome writes of Paula, That she so bewailed light sins (that is, such as
are commonly so esteemed) that a man would have thought her guilty of grievous
crimes: and he elsewhere yields a good reason for it; Because, says he, I
know not how we may say any thing is light, whereby the divine Majesty is
slighted. Secondly, admitting that some sins are to be accounted no bigger
than moats, yet as a moat it it be not taken out of the eye hinders the
sight, so the least sin hinders grace, and if it be not repented of, or
pardoned for Christ's sake, is sufficient to damn the soul of the sinner.
Thirdly, neither Christ by the farthing in the fifth of Matthew understands
sin, nor the Apostle by hay and stubble lesser or venial sins; but Christ
by farthing understands the last payment of debt, Saint Paul light and vain
doctrines, which are to be tried by the fire of the Spirit. For in that place
the Apostle by fire cannot mean the fire of Purgatory, because gold and silver
are tried, that is, precious doctrines or good works, by the fire Saint Paul
there speaks of: whereas Purgatory fire is for men's persons, to cleanse and
purge them from their lesser sins, as the Papists teach.

James affirms) has strength enough to conceive sin, and sin when it is
finished to bring forth death.

Athanasius Creed, All men shall rise again with their own bodies, and give
an account of their own works: and if their account be not the better, that
dreadful sentence shall pass against them, Go ye cursed into everlasting
fire.

Let us lay all these particulars together, and the total arising out of them
will be this, That though there be a great difference of sins, whereof some
are lighter, compared to a fescu, or moate; others heavier, compared to a
beam: some smaller, likened to gnats; others greater, to Mat. 23.24.
camels; some easier to account for, resembled to mites or farthings; others
with more difficulty, as talents: and in like manner, although there are diverse
degrees of punishments in hell fire, as there were diverse degrees of civil
punishments among the Jews; yet that we are accountable for the least sins,
and that the weakest desire and suddenest motion to evil is concupiscence,
which if it be not killed in us by grace, will conceive sin, and that sin
when it is consummate will bring forth death. We need no more fightings the
truth has already gotten the victory by the weapons of her sworn enemies, and
Goliath is already slain with his own sword; yet that ye may know how strong
the doctrine of our Church is, I will bring forth, and muster some of her
trained band.

First, we have two uncontrollable testimonies out of the book of Deuteronomy,
Deuteronomy. 27.26. and 30.19.
Cursed is he that confirms not all the words of this Law to do them: and,
Behold, I have set before you this day life and good, death and evil, blessing
and cursing. The former is cited by Saint Paul, to prove that all that hoped to
be justified by the Law were under the curse: for it is written, says he, Gal.
3.10.
Cursed is every man that confirms not all things that are written in the Law
to do them. Now there is no commandment which is not written in the book of
the Law, to which whosoever Deuteronomy. 4.2.
adds, is accursed. To these plain and evident passages of Scripture may be
adjoined three like unto them, The Ezekiel. 18.4. Romans 6.23. 1 Cor. 15.56.
soul that sins shall dye. The wages of sin is death: and, The sting of
death is sin. These pregnant testimonies the Cardinal endeavors to elude
with these and the like glosses; The soul that sins, that is, mortally,
shall dye: and the wages of sin, that is, of mortal sin, is death: and the
sting of death is sin, that is, deadly sin. With as good color of reason
in all Texts of Scriptures wherein we are deterred from sin, he might
interpose this his gloss, and say, eschew evil, that is, all deadly evil:
fly sin, that is, mortal sin: and consequently deny that venial sins
are any where forbidden. But as when we read in the common or civil law
these and the like titles, the punishment of felony, murder, treason, fimony,
sacrilege, we understand the law of all crimes of the same kind; so in like
manner when the Apostle says indefinitely, the wages of sin is death, we are
to understand him of every sin: for, Non est distinguendum ubi lex non
distinguit, we must not distinguish where the law distinguishes not. For he
that so does, adds to the law, or takes from it, and thereby incurreth the
curse pronounced by the lawgiver. And though other Texts of Scriptures might
brook the like restriction, yet not those above alleged. For what is the
meaning of this phrase, Death is the wages of sin; but that sin deserves
death? which is all one as to say, that sin is mortal. Now add hereunto
Bellarmines gloss, The wages of sin, that is, mortal sin, is death: and,
the soul that sins, that is, that sins mortally, shall dye; and the
propositions will prove mere tautologies, as if the Prophet had said, The
soul that sins a sin unto death shall dye; and the Apostle, sin that
deserves death, deserves death. What is it to deprave the meaning of the Holy
Ghost, if this be not? especially considering, that the Prophet Ezekiel in the
self same chapter, ver. 31. declares his meaning to be of sin in general,
without any restriction or limitation: Cast away from you all your
transgressions, and make you a new heart, so iniquity shall not be your
destruction. Here ye see no means to avoid death, but by casting away all
transgressions: for since the Law requires Jam. 2.10. Whosoever shall keep the
whole Law, and yet offends in one point, is guilty of all.
entire obedience, he that violateth any one commandment, is liable to the
punishment of the breach of the whole Law. To smother this clear light of
truth, it is strange to see what smoaky distinctions the adversaries have
devised of peccatum simpliciter and secundum quid, and peccatum contra Legem
and praeter Legem, sins against the Law and besides the Law: Venial sins,
say they, are besides the Law, not against the Law. Are not they besides
themselves that so distinguish? For let them answer punctually, Does the Law of
God forbid those they call venial sins, or not? If not, then are they no
sins, or the Law is not perfect, in that it meets not with all enormities
and transgressions: If the Law forbids them, then are they against the Law.
For sin, says Saint John, is the 1 John 3 4.
transgression of the Law. If then venial escapes are sins, they must needs
be violations of the Law, and so not only praeter, besides, but contra Legem,
against it. The Law (as Christ expounds it) Matthew the fifth, forbids a
rash word, a wanton look, nay unadvised passion; and what lesser sins can be
thought than sins of thought? therefore, says Moral. p. 1. l. 4.
Azorius the Jesuit, we must say that venial sin is against the Law, as
Cajetan, Durand, and Vega taught: we must say so, unless we will reject the
definition of sin given by Saint Austine, and generally received by the
Schools ( dictum, factum, vel concupitum contra Legem aeternam, that sin is
a thought, word, or deed against the eternal Law) unless we will contradict
the ancient Fathers, by name, Saint Greg. l. 8. in Job. In praesenti mortem
carnis patior, and tamen adhuc de futuro judicio graviorem morte destructionis
tuae sententiam pertimesco, quantalibet enim justicia polleant, nequaquam sibi
ad innocentiam vel electi sufficient, si in judicio districte judicentur.
Gregory: In the morning if thou seek me, thou shall not find me. Now I
sleep in dust, that is, in this present I suffer the death of the flesh, and
yet in the future judgment I fear the sentence of damnation, more grievous
than death: for the Elect themselves, how righteous soever they are, will not
be found innocent, if God deal with them according to strict justice: And
Saint Ep. 14. Omne quod loquimur, aut de lata, aut de angutta via est. si cum
paucis subtilem quandam semitam invenimus ad vitam tendimus; si multorum
comitamur viam, secundum Domini sententiam imus ad mortem.
Jerome, Whatsoever we do, whatsoever we speak, either belongs to the broad
way or to the narrow; if with a few we find out a narrow path, we tend toward
life: if we keep company with many in the great road, we go to death. And in
his second Lib. 2. cont. Pel. c. 4. Quis nostrum potest huic vitio non
subjacere? cum etiam pro otioso verbo reddituri simus rationem in judicio, si
ita, and sermonis injuria, atque interdum jocus judicio, coucilioque, and
gehennae ignibus delegantur, quid merebitur turpium rerum appetitio?
book against the Pelagians, where rehearsing the words of our Savior, He
that is unadvisedly angry with his brother, shall be in danger of judgment,
thus reflecteth upon himself and his brethren: Which of us can be free from
this vice? If unadvised anger, and a contumelious word, and sometimes a jest,
brings a man in danger of judgment, council, and hell fire, what do impure
desires, and other more grievous sins deserve? And Saint Chrysostom. com. in Mat.
5. Mirantur multi hominem qui fratrem levem aut fatuum appellaverit,
sempiternae morti condemnari, cum tertio quoque verbo alti alus id dicere
soleamus.
Chrysostom, who thus quavereth upon the same note: Many are startled when
they hear that he shall be condemned to eternal death, who calls his
brother giddy-braine or fool; since nothing is so common among us, we hardly
speak three words in disputing with any man, but we break out into such
course language.

Yea, but some will say, What? is the nodding at a Sermon, the stealing a
farthing, the breaking of a jest such an heinous matter, that it deserves
everlasting torments of body and soul in Hell? I answer with Saint Aug. l. 2.
cont. Donat. Non afferamus stateras dolosas, ubi appendamus quod volumus, and
quomodo volumus pro arbitrio nostro, di centes hoc grave est, hoc leve, sed
afferamus stateram divinam de Scripturis sanctis, tanquam de thesauris Domini,
and in illa quid sit grave appendamus.
Austine, in the estimation of sins we ought not to bring out deceitful
weights of our own, but out of the Scriptures, golden weights sealed by God,
and in them see what is light, and what is weighty. In these scales we shall
find the least sin to be heavy enough to weigh down to the ground, yea, to
Hell: for every offense committed against an infinite Majesty, deserves an
infinite punishment: every transgression of the eternal Law, excludes a man
from eternal happiness, and deserves eternal death: Whosoever shall break
one of the least commandments, says our Mat. 5.19.
Savior, and teach men so, shall be least in the Kingdom of heaven. Here
Bellarmine wishes us to mark, that Christ says not simply, he that breaks
one of the least commandments, but he that breaks it and teaches others to
do so. We mark it well, and that clause may serve to brand him and his fellow
Priests and Jesuits: for who teach men to break the least commandments, if not
they, whose doctrine is, that venial sins are not against the Law, nor
simply and properly to be called sins, but rather naevuli, aspergines, and
pulvisculi, that is, dustings, or spertings, or small spots, warts, or blisters.

Ye all perceive how much this Text of Scripture makes for us in our doctrine
against Papists; but I fear it makes as much against us in our lives. Do we
so live, as if we were persuaded that the least sins, inasmuch as they are
committed against an infinite Majesty, and are breaches of his eternal Law,
are exceeding great, nay infinite? Could we drink iniquity as the beast does
water, if we thought it were deadly poison? Do we make great account of small
sins? nay do we not rather make small account of the greatest? Who ever
espied an Adder thrusting his sting at him, and started not back? Natures
insensible of pain, and ignorant of that danger, do no less. For if any
venomous thing be applied to any part of our body, the blood, as if it took
notice of its deadly enemy, flies back, and turns it streams another way:
and shall not our conscience, which has knowledge and sense of the venom of
sin, be much more fearful of it? It is no amplification of the malignant
nature of sin, to compare it to a poison: it is rather a diminution. For no
poison could ever yet be made so strong, that the least imaginary quantity
thereof was deadly; the least thought of sin, yea the sin of thought is so.
Poisons be they never so pernicious and deadly, are pernicious and hurtful to
that part only which of it self is mortal, I mean our bodies; but sin
kills that part that naturally cannot dye: it slays our immortal spirits.
There are many forcible arguments to deter us even from small sins, and to
excite us to watch over them: as,

1. Quia difficilius caventur, because it is a thing more difficult to avoid
them than the greater. Many are choked with small bones of fishes, but few
with greater; because they are usually felt in the mouth before they go down
the throat. Solinus writes of a kind of Polihist. c. 8. Brevissima apud
Amyclas vipera est, ac propterea dum despectui est, facilius nocet.
viper of a small quantity, that does much more hurt than the greater, because
the most part of men sleighten it.

2. Quia difficilius curantur, because the wound that is given by them is with
more difficulty cured: as a prick made with a bodkin, or a steeletto, if it be
deep, is more dangerous than a wound given with a greater weapon; because the
flesh presently closes up, and the blood issuing not forth, runs inwardly
with greater abundance.

3. Quia ad majora viam muniunt, because they are a preparation and disposition
to greater offenses. As the wimble pierces the wood, and makes way for the
auger; so the smaller sins make a breach in the conscience, and thereby a way
to greater. The least sins are as the little thieves that creep in at the
windows, and open the doors to the greater, that rifle the house, and rob the
soul of all her spiritual wealth: whence is that observation of Saint Lib. 9.
mor. in Job. Si vitare parva negligimus, insensibiliter seducti majora etiam
perpetramus.
Gregory, If we stick not at small sins, ere we are aware we shall make no
bones of the greatest.

4. Quia parva peccata crebra ita nos praegravant, ut unum grande, because
small sins with their multitude and number as much hurt the soul, as great
sins with their weight. The Herrings, though a weak and contemptible kind of
fish, yet by their number kill the greatest Whale. What skilleth it (says
Saint Aug. ep. 108. Quid interest ad naufragium, an uno grandi fluctu navis
operiatur, an paulatim subrepens aqua in sentinam, and per negligentiam
derelicta impleat navem, atque submerguntur? Et sermon. 10. de diverse. Quid
interest utrum te plumbum premat an arena? plumbum una massa est, arenae minuta
grana sunt: nonne vides de minutis guttis impleri flumina? minuta sunt, sed
multa sunt.
Austine) whether a ship be overwhelmed with one great wave, or drowned by a
leake in the bottom unespyed, in which the water enters drop by drop? What
eases it a man to be pressed to death with a heap of sands, more than with a
sow of lead? Are not the greatest rivers filled by drops? The sins we
ordinarily commit, minuta sunt, sed multa sunt, they are small, but they are
many; and what they lose in the quantity, they get in the number.

These indeed are important considerations, yet (me thinks) there is more,
nay there is all that can be said in this clause of the Apostle, The end of
those things is death: the smaller sins, as well as the greater, in their
own nature are mortal. It is a more fearful thing, I confess, to be plunged
into the bottom of a headless lake, than to sink a little under water: yet
he that is held under water, how near soever it be to the top, till his breath
is gone, is as certainly drowned, as he that is found dead in the bottom. It
is but a miserable comfort to be put in hope of an upper room in Hell, and
not to be thrust into the lowest dungeon. Wherefore, as ye tender the life of
your bodies and souls, hearken to a word of exhortation: Taste not the least
drop of the poison of sin; for though it put you not to so great torment, and
be not so present death, yet deadly it is, and without repentance and saving
grace will kill your souls. Destroy the Cockatrice in the shell, break the
smallest seeds of sin in your soul, as the Emmet biteth the seeds which she
lays up for her self, that they may not grow again in the earth. Parvulos
Babylonis allidite ad petram, in qua serpentis vestigia non reperiuntur; Dash
the Babylonish babes against that rock, into which no serpent can enter. I
know not how it comes to pass, that as in nature we see the Adamant, which
nothing relenteth at the stroke of the hammer, is dissolved with the warm
blood of a Goat; the Elephant, which no great beast dare encounter, is killed
by a small Mouse creeping in at his truncke, and eating his brains; and the
Lions in Mesopotamia are so pestered with a kind of Gnat, flying into their
eyes, that to be rid of the pain, they sometimes tear them out with their
claws, and sometimes drown themselves: so the strongest Christians are often
over-taken with the least temptations, and conquered with a reed, nay, with a
bull-rush. To forbear more examples; David was taken by a look only: Peter
affrighted by the speech of a Damsel: Alipius was overthrown by a shout in
the Theater. The breach of the Commandment in less things, even because they
are less, and so might more easily be avoided, makes the disobedience the
greater; and all sin is the more dangerous, by how much the less it is
feared. Saint Austine makes mention of certain flies in Africa, so small,
that they can scarce be discerned from moates in the air: Quae tamen cum
insederint corpori acerbissimo fodiunt aculeo, which yet are armed with a most
venomous sting: those little sins that are so small, that we can scarce
discern them to be sins, are like those Cynifes Saint Austine speaks of,
they prick the conscience with a most venomous sting. Now if the sting of
these small Flies put the conscience to such pain, and affect it with such
anguish, who will be able to endure the teeth of the Adder, or the tail of the
Scorpion? If whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in
danger of the Judgment: and whosoever shall say unto his brother, Racha, shall
be in danger of the Council: and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in
danger of hell fire; what punishment is he like to endure, who bears malice
in his heart against his brother, envieth his prosperity, undermineth his
estate, wounds his good name, nay spilleth his blood? this is a crimson
sin, and mortal in a double sense: not only because it slays the soul,
but also because it kills the body. If we shall give an account at the day of
judgment for every idle word, what answer shall we make for irreligious and
blasphemous words? for calumnious and detractious speeches? for uncharitable
and unchristian censures? for false witness? for oaths? for perjury? I am
loath harder to rub on the sores and galls of your consciences, and leave them
raw: therefore my conclusion shall be the application of a plaster unto them,
which will certainly heal them. That which our Savior after his resurrection
promised to those that should believe on his Name, that if they Mar. 16.18.
drank any deadly thing it should not hurt them, was performed according to
the letter to the Disciples in the first ages; but in the spiritual sense to
all of us at this day. If we have drunk any deadly poison of sin, as who
has not? yet through repentance and faith in Christ's blood it shall not hurt
us. The nature of poison is to work upon the blood, and to venom that humor:
but contrariwise, the blood of our Savior works upon the poison of sin,
and kills the venomous malignity thereof. Though the most venial sins in
men's esteem are mortal in their own nature, yet the most mortal are made
venial by grace. No sin mortal but to the reprobate and infidel; no sin
venial but to the elect and faithful: nay, no sin but mortal to the
reprobate and infidel, no sin but venial to the faithful and penitent.
Nothing deadly to Gods chosen, nay, not death it self. For the sting thereof
is plucked out by Christ: O death, 1 Cor. 15.57.
where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be unto God, who
has given us victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Thanks be unto thee, O
Hieron. epit. Nepot Gratias tibi, Christ Salvator, nos tua agimus creatura,
quod tam potentem adversarium dum occideris, occidisti.
Savior, who have given death his deaths wound by thy death. Beloved
Christians, so many sins as we have committed, so many deaths eternal we have
deserved; from so many deaths Christ has delivered us: and therefore so many
lives, if we had them, we owe unto him, and shall we not willingly render him
this one, for which he will give us immortality, bliss, and glory in heaven
with himself? Cui, etc.

THE GALL OF ASPES: OR THE PANGS OF THE SECOND DEATH. THE XLV. SERMON.
ROMANS 6.21. For the end of those things it death.


Right Honorable, etc.
I Hope time has not razed those characters out of your memory, which I
borrowed from time it self, to imprint my observations upon this Text in your
mind. Sin (as ye have heard) may be considered in a reference to a
threefold time: 1. Past, 2. Present, 3. Future.


In relation to the first, it is unfruitful: to the second, shameful: to the
third, pernicious and deadly.

The unfruitfulnesse of sin cannot but work upon all that have regard to
their estate in this world; the shamefulnesse of sin cannot but touch near,
and affect deeply all that stand upon their reputation and good name; but the
deadliness or pernicious nature thereof cannot but prevail with all, to
beware of it, that tender their life here, or immortality hereafter. If sin
be unfruitful, have no fellowship with the works of darkness, but reprove
them rather. If sin be shameful, hate even the garments spotted by the
flesh; let not such things be named among you, much less practiced, which cast
a blurre upon your good name and fame among the Saints of God. If sin be
pernicious and deadly, fly from it as from a Serpent: taste not the wine of
Sodom, nor press the grapes of Gomorrah; for their wine is the blood of the
Dragon, Job 20.14.
and the gall of Aspes, which we know is present death.

The end of those things. That is, all the pomp and vanity of this world, the
lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, the pride of life: all sinful
pleasures, wherewith ye surfeit your senses, shall have an end, and this end
is death, and this death shall have no end. This is the last and most forcible
argument of the three, wherewith the Apostle labors with might and maine to
beat down sin, and put to flight even whole armies of temptations. Ye may
observe a perfect gradation in the arguments: the first, though strong and
forcible, drawn from the unfruitfulnesse of sin, is not so necessary and
constraining as the second, drawn from the shame and infamy thereof: nor that
as the third, drawn from the wages thereof, which is everlasting death. As
honor and glory is to be more set by than gain and commodity, life than
honor, immortality than life; so shame and infamy is worse than loss and
disadvantage, death than shame, hell than death. The holy Apostle has now made
three offers unto us, and put us to a threefold choice.

First, he laid before us the fair fruits of Paradise, to be gathered from
the tree of life; and corrupt and rotten fruit from the forbidden tree: that
is, invaluable treasures to be got, and inestimable profit to be made by
godliness; and irrecoverable losses to be sustained by ungodly and sinful
courses of thriving.

Secondly, he tendered unto you glory and honor, to be purchased by the
service of God; as on the contrary shame and infamy by retaining upon Satan,
and pursuing sinful pleasures.

Now in the third place he sets before you life and death; life by the gift
of God, and death for the hire of sin. Shall I need to exhort you in the
words of Deuteronomy. 30.19.
Moses, Choose life? how can ye do otherwise? Is the flesh appalled at the
death of the body, though the pain thereof endure but for a moment? and shall
not the spirit be much more affrighted at the death of the soul, the pangs and
pains whereof never have an end? If there be any so retchlesse and careless
of his estate, that he passes not for great and irrecoverable damages and
losses: so foolish that he esteems not of inestimable treasures: if any be so
infamous, that he has no credit to lose, or so armed with proof of impudency,
that he can receive no wound from shame: yet I am sure there is none that
lives, who is not in some fear of death, especially a tormenting death, and
that of the soul, and that which strikes all dead, everlasting. Therefore it
is (as I conceive) that the Apostle, according to the precept of Rhetoricians,
Cic. de orat. l. 2.
Puncta caeterorum argumentorum occulit, coucheth as it were, and hides the
points of other arguments, but thrusts out this, putting upon it the sign
and mark of a reason (For.) For the end of those things is death. And this he
does for good reason, because this last argument is worth all the former, and
enforces them all: it not only sharpneth the point of them, but draws them
up to the head at the sinner. For therefore are lewd and wicked courses
unprofitable; therefore we may be ashamed of them, because their end is so bad.

For the end. Why does the Apostle skip over the middle, and come presently to
the end? why lays he the whole force of his argument upon the end?

1. Because there is nothing in sin upon which we may build, or have any
assurance thereof but the end, as there is nothing certain of this our present
life, but the incertainty thereof. Sin sometimes has no middle, as we see in
those fearful examples of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, who had no sooner opened
their mouths against Moses, but the earth opened her mouth to swallow them up
quick: of Achan, who had no sooner devoured the accursed thing, but it was
drawn out of his belly with bowels, heart and all: of Herod, who had no sooner
heard the people cry, The voice of God and not of man, but he felt himself a
worm and no man: of Zimri and Cozbi, who had no sooner received the dart of
lust in their heart, than they felt a javelin in their bodies: of Ananias and
Sapphira, who no sooner kept back part of the price for which they sold their
possessions, but death seized upon them, and they gave up the ghost; and of
many others whose deaths wounds yet bleed afresh in sacred and profane stories.

2 Because there is nothing permanent of sin but the end: the duration, if it
have any, is very short, like to that of Jonahs gourd, Jonah 3.7.
which rose up in a night, and was eaten up with a worm in the morning.

3 Because nothing is so much to be regarded in any thing as the end; for
fines principia actionum, the end sets the efficient on work; and all is
well that ends well, as we say in the Proverb. Deuteronomy. 32.29.
O that they were wise, says God by Moses, then they would consider their
latter end. If we invert the speech, it will be as true, O that men would
consider their latter end, and then they would be wise. For assuredly he that
in his serious contemplation begins at the end of sin, in his practice
will end at the beginning. To consider the end of sin, is to take a survey of
all the miseries and calamities incident to intelligent natures; of all the
plagues that light upon the bodies, and souls, and estates of impenitent
sinners in this life, with a fearful expectation of hellish torments; then a
violent separation of the soul from the body, which is no sooner made, but the
soul is presented before the dreadful Judge of quick and dead, arraigned,
condemned, and immediately upon sentence haled and dragged by ugly fiends to
the dark and loathsome dungeon of hell, there in all extremity of pains and
tortures, without any ease or mitigation, to continue till the general day of
the worlds doom; when meeting again with the body, her companion in all
filthiness, iniquity, and ungodliness, they are both summoned to the last
judgment, where all their open and secret sins are laid open to the view of
men and Angels, to their inexpressible and astonishable confusion: after
conviction the sentence, at which not the ears only shall tingle, the teeth
chatter, the knees smite one the other, but the heart also melt; the sentence,
I say, of eternal damnation shall be pronounced in their hearing, Mat. 25.41.
Go ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. A
most heavy sentence, never to be recalled, and presently to be put in
execution, the Devil with reviling and insultation carrying them, with all
their wicked friends and associates, to the place of endless torments, to
endure the full wrath of God, and the pains of everlasting fire. O what will
it be to feel the second death, which it is death to think or speak of! who
can read the description thereof in Saint De vit. contemp. l. 3. c. 12. Fieri
patriae coelestis extorrem, mori vitae beatae, morti vivere sempiternae, in
aeternum cum diabolo expelli, ubi sit mors secunda damnatis exilium, vita
supplicium: non sentire in illo igne quod illuminat, sentire quod cruciat;
inefficacis poenitentiae igne exuri, and consumentis conscientiae verme
immortaliter rodi, inundantis incendii terribiles crepitus pati, barathri
fumantis amara caligine oculos obscurari, profundo gehennae fluctuantis mergi.
Prosper with dry eyes? To be banished for ever from our celestial country,
to be dead to all joy and happiness, and to live to eternal death; for ever
to be cast out with the Devil thither where the second death serves for a
banishment to the damned, and life for a torment, there to feel in that
unquenchable fire the torment of heat, and not receive any comfort of light; to
be cruciated with heart burning sorrow, and uneffectuall repentance, to be
gnawne with the immortal worm of conscience, to frye perpetually in crackling
flames, to have their eyes put out with the smoke of the river of brimstone,
to be drowned floating in the bottom of hell.

The end, etc. Understanding by end the final effect, not the final cause of
sin: by those things, all those things he spoke of before: and by death,
that death which is opposed to eternal life; each of these words, Finis Horum
Mors, yields a most wholesome and fruitful observation: 1 That all sinful
courses and ways have an end: Finis. 2 That all sins are mortal (of which
before): Horum. 3 That eternal death of body and soul in hell, is the wages
which the impenitent and obstinate sinner shall receive to the uttermost
farthing: Mors.
That all sinful pleasures and delights have an end no man can doubt; for they
cannot survive our life here, our life often surviveth them: and what is our
life, but Pind. (...).
fumi umbra, the shadow of smoke, or dream of a shadow? that is, less than
nothing. Seneca out of his own experience found honor to be of the nature of
glass, quae cum splendet frangitur, which when it most glowes and glisteneth
in the furnace, suddenly cracketh; and pleasure to be like a spark, quae cum
accenditur extinguitur, which is quenched in the kindling. And surely all
comforts and contentments of worldly men are like bubbles of soap blown by
children out of a wallnut-shell into the air, which fly a little while, and
by the reflection of the sun beams make a glorious show, but with a small puff
of wind are broken and dissolved to nothing. But alas it is not so with the
pain of sin as it is with the pleasure, that is as lasting as the other is
durelesse: Leve and momentaneum est quod delectat, aeternum est quod cruciat;
The delight of sin is for a moment, but the torment remains for ever. Who
will be content to fast all the week for one good meals meat? to lie in
prison all the days of his life for one hours liberty and jollity? These
similitudes fall short, and reach not home to the representing of the sinners
folly, who for swimming an hour in the bath of pleasure, incurreth the danger
of boiling for ever in a river of brimstone, and torrent of fire: Momentaneum
est quod delectat, aeternum est quod cruciat. Those things whereof ye are
ashamed have an end, and how soon ye know not; but the death which is the end
of them has no end, and this we know. That we may more fully understand what
is meant by this end, we are to take notice of a double death: The first
commonly called death temporal, The second which is death eternal.
Aug. de Civ. Dei. l. 21. Prima mors animam nolentem pellit de corpore, secunda
mors animam nolentem tenet in corpore. Idem de Civ. Dei, l. 13. Prima mors
bonis bona est, malis mala; secunda ut nullorum bonorum est, ita nulli bona.
The first death drives the soul out of the body, being unwilling to part
with it; the second death keeps the soul against her will in the body: the
first death is the separation of the soul from the body, the second death is
the separation of body and soul from God; and by how much God is more
excellent than the soul, by so much the second death is worse than the first.
The first death is good to good men, because it ends their sorrows, and
begins their joys; but evil to evil men, because it ends their joys, and
begins their everlasting weeping and gnashing of teeth: the second at it
belongs to none that are good, so it is good to none. Both of these
doubtless are due to sin, and shall be paid at their day: the sentence
pronounced against Adam, morte morieris, by the reduplication of the word
seems to imply as much as thou shall dye again and again, the first and
second death; the first death is as the earnest-penny, the second as the whole
hire, both make up the wages of sin: the first is like the splitting of the
ship, and casting away all the goods and wares; the latter as the burning both,
with unquenchable fire. In this death which is the destruction of nature, that
Maxim of Philosophy holds not, Omnis corruption est in instanti: for here is
corruption in time, nay, which is more strange, and to the reason of the
natural man involveth contradiction, Corruption aeterna, and mors immortalis,
an eternal corruption, and an immortal death. Aug. loc sup. Nemo hic proprie
moriens, seu in morte dicitur, sed ante morte aut post mortem, id est, viventes
aut mortui: ibi e contrario, non erunt homines ante mortem, aut post mortem,
sed sine fine morientes; and nunquam pejus erit homini in morte, quam ubi erit
mors ipsa sine morte.
In this life men cannot properly be said to be dying, or in death, but alive
or dead: for whilst the soul remains in the body we are living, and after
the separation thereof we are dead: whereas they that are in hell cannot be
said properly to be dead, because they are most sensible of pain; nor to be
alive, because they suffer the punishment of the second death; but continually
dying, and never shall it be worse with man in death, than where death it self
is without death, where life perpetually dies, and death perpetually lives.
Saint Greg. l. 9. moral. c. 45.
Gregory sweetly quavereth upon this sad note; Mors sine morte, finis sine
fine, defectus fine defectu, quia and mors vivit, and finis incipit, and
deficere nescit defectus: The death of the damned is a deathlesse death, an
endless end, and undefcizible defect; for their death always lives, and
their end begins, and their consumption lasts. And that this death is
meant in my text either only or especially, the correspondencie of this member
to that which follows, but the gift of God is eternal life, makes it
manifest. Yet for further confirmation hereof, that the wages of sin is
eternal death, I will produce manifold testimonies of Scripture beyond all
exception, not so much to convince Aug. l. 22 de Civ Dei. Origines eo erravit
deformius quo sensit clementius.
the error of Origin, who was of opinion that all the damned, yea the Devils
themselves, should in the end be released of their torments; as to settle a
doubt which troubles the minds of the godly, how it should be just with God
to inflict eternal punishments upon men for temporal transgressions.

For your better satisfaction herein, may it please you to take notice of two
opinions concerning the rule of justice and goodness: the first makes the
will of God the rule of good, the latter goodness the rule of Gods will. If
ye embrace the former opinion, to prove that it is just to repay eternal
punishments to temporary and finite offenses, it will be sufficient to show
that it is Gods will and good pleasure so to do: if ye incline to the latter
opinion, it will be farther requisite to show the congruity of such
proceedings with the principles of reason, and rules of justice among men. It
is very reasonable to think that God has always a reason for his will, yet
it is safest for us to take his will for a reason. For God cannot will any
thing, but as he wills it, it is just and good: and that it is Gods will and
decree to torment them eternally who dye impenitently, appears by the words
of our Savior; Mat. 25.46.
These shall go into everlasting pain: and of Saint 2 These. 1.9.
Paul, These shall be punished with everlasting perdition, from the presence
of the Lord, and glory of his power: and of Saint Apoc 20.10
John, And the Devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, where the beast and the false Prophet shall be tormented day and
night for evermore. Thus much of the torments in general; in special, that
the fire is unquenchable we read in Saint Mat. 3.11.
Matthew, The chafe he will burn with unquenchable fire: and in Saint Jude 7.
Jude, Which suffer the vengeance of eternal fire. How should the fire ever
go out, since as the Prophet Esaias informs us, Isa. 30.33.
The breath of the Lord, like a river of brimstone, continually kindles it?
And that the worm likewise is immortal Christ teaches, Mar. 9.44, 46, 48.
Where the worm, says he, never dies, and the fire is not quenched: and that
the darkness likewise is perpetual we hear out of Saint Peter, 2 Pet. 2.17.
They are Wells without water, clouds carried about with a tempest, to whom
black darkness is reserved for ever: yea the chains of this prison wherewith
the damned are manacled and fettered, are everlasting: for the Angels that kept
not their first estate, says Saint Jude, Jude 6.
God has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgment
of the great day: and lastly, The Apoc. 14.11.
fume and the stench of the brimstone lake rises up perpetually, and the
smoke of their torment shall ascend for evermore. Neither can it be answered
in behalf or comfort of the damned, that indeed hell torments shall still
endure, but that they shall not be always in durance; that the rack shall
remain, but they shall not be everlastingly tortured on it; that the Jaile
shall stand, but that the prisoners shall not always be kept in it: for the
Scipture is as express for the reprobates enduring, as for the during of those
pains: They shall go, says Christ, Mat. 25.46.
into everlasting fire: 2 These. 1.9.
They shall suffer, says Saint Paul, the pains of everlasting perdition:
Apoc. 20.10.
They shall be tormented, says Saint John, with fire and brimstone for
evermore: and therefore the fire is called Mar. 9.44.
their fire, ignis eorum, because it burns them; and the worm their worm,
because it feeds upon them; and the torments their torments, because they
pain and torture them. These texts are so plain, that Cardinal Bellarmine
himself professedly refuteth those of his own side, who give credit to the
legend, which relates that by the prayers of Saint Gregory the soul of Trajan
was delivered out of hell. The good will and pleasure of God concerning the
condition of the damned being thus made known unto us, we are to tremble at
his judgments, and quell and keep under every thought that mutines against
them. To call Gods justice in question concerning the everlasting torments of
the damned, is to bring our selves in danger of them. Are not Gods actions just
because we see not the squire by which they are regulated? Aug. l. 2. de Civ.
Dei. Cujus plene judicia nemo comprehendit, nemo just reprehendit.
though we cannot comprehend all Gods judgments, yet we may not reprehend
any: Multa Dei judicia occulta sunt, nulla injusta, many judgments of God are
secret, none unjust. In particular, concerning this point much has and may be
said in justification of Gods proceeding with the damned, even by humane reason.

1. Saint Austine rightly observes, that in punishing offenses we are not so
much to regard the time, as the quality; the duration, as the enormity. A man
justly lies by it the whole year for a rash word spoken in a moment: another
is condemned to the Galleys all his life for a murder or a rape committed on
the sudden in hot blood; therefore howsoever the sins of the reprobate are but
temporal, yet the circumstances of them may be so odious, and the number of
them so great, and the nature so heinous, that they may deserve eternal
punishments.

2. Where the guilt still remains, it is not against justice that the party
still suffer: but in the souls of all infidels and impenitent sinners, whose
consciences were never washed, neither in the salt water of their own tears,
nor in the sweet laver of regeneration, the guilt of all their sins still
remains; and therefore justly they may be eternally punished for them.

3. An impenitent sinner, if he should always live upon the earth, would
always hold on his sinful course; and that he breaks it off at his death it
is no thank to him: had he still the use of his tongue, he would still
blaspheme and curse: had he still the use of his eyes, he would still look
after vanity: had he still the use of his feet, he would still walk in
crooked ways: had he still the use of his hands, he would still work all
manner of wickedness: had he still the free use of all the faculties of his
soul, and members of his body, he would still make them weapons of
unrighteousnes. Inchinus the Inchin. lib. de 4 Novis.
Romish Postillar gives some light to this truth by an inch of candle, whereby
two play at tables in the night, and are very earnest at their game; but in the
midst of it the candle goes out, and they perforce give over, who (no doubt)
if the light had lasted, would have played all night. This inch of candle is
the time of life allotted to a wicked man, who is resolved to spend it all in
sinful pleasures and pastimes: and if it would last perpetually, he would
never leave his play: and therefore since he would sin eternally, though by
reason that the light of his life goes out he cannot, he deserves eternal
punishment.

4. Though the sins of the reprobate are finite in respect of the time and the
agents, yet (as they are committed against an infinite Majesty) the guilt of
them is infinite.

Here it will be objected, That if sins be infinite in any respect, they must
needs be all equal, because infinity admits no degrees: nothing can be more
or less infinite. I answer, that although Camp rat 8. Paradox.
Campian and other Papists charge the reformed Churches with that absurd
Paradoxe of the Stoickes, That all sins are equal: and consequently, that it
is as great a wickedness to kill a Capon to furnish a luxurious feast, as to
kill a man: yet their heart cannot but smite them for so notorious a calumny:
for they themselves teach, That mortal sins, as they are committed against
God, are of infinite guilt, and deserve infinite and eternal punishments; and
yet they hold not, that all mortal sins are equal, their Casuists teaching,
that parricide is a greater sin than murder, incest than adultery, blasphemy
than perjury: all of them being mortal. As for the knot of the former
objection, it is thus easily untyed, That sins may be considered either in a
genericall notion, as they are breaches of the eternal Law, and offend an
infinite Majesty; in which respect as they are infinite, so they are equal: or
in a specificall reason, as they are of this or that kind clothed with such and
such circumstances, as they are breaches of the first or second Table, as they
are committed immediately against God, or mediately, once or often, on the
sudden or unadvisedly, ignorantly or wilfully, out of infirmity or
presumptuously, tending much or little to the hurt or prejudice of our
neighbor: In all which and diverse like respects, the guilt of sin is
improved or diminished, and one sin is more heinous and less pardonable than
another.

We have said enough to these words for their coherence, sense, and
construction: let us now see what they say to us for our further use and
instruction. There is no physic, but if it work makes the patient sicker
for the present; and for the most part the smarting plaster most speedily
cures the wound. These observations are true in corporal physic, and much
more in spiritual, because the smart of sin, and trouble of conscience for
it, are not so much signs and symptoms of maladies, as the beginning of
cures. Some say, the fear of the plague brings it; but if we speak of this
plague, and other judgments of God for sin, it is certain, that the fear
of them is the best preservative against them: he only may be secure of the
avoiding Hell torments, and escaping the pangs of eternal death, who fears
them as he ought; and he that fears them not, is in a most fearful case. O
Ecclus. 41.1.
death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee! It was spoken of the first
death, but may with greater reason of the second: some tastes whereof I will
give you at this present, as well to make you loath the morsels of Satan, as
the better to relish the fruits of the tree of life. The first shall be out of
Saint Matthew, Mat. 25.10.
Clausae sunt fores, the doors were shut: Conceive ye that to be now, which,
if ye prevent it not, certainly shall be, that after ye have heard the
Archangel sound the last Trump, and with him a Quire of heavenly spirits
singing an Epithalamium or marriage song, ye should see the gates of Heaven
opened, and the Son of man marching out of them with an innumerable company
of Angels, presently sent abroad to gather the Elect from the four winds, and
soon after infinite troops of them assembled from all parts in goodly order
and glorious armor, accompanying our Savior in his triumphant return into
heaven, to receive each of them a crown of glory, and you caught up into the
clouds, pressing hard after them to enter with them into heaven, should be
presently stayed, and the gates shut against you and fastened with everlasting
bars: O! what a corrasive would this be? what a disgrace? what an unspeakable
grief, to have a glimpse of the celestial Jerusalem, and to be excluded for
ever out of it? to see those whom ye sometimes scorned, reviled, and trod under
foot, admitted into Christ's Kingdom before your face, and you repelled with a
non novivos, Away from me, I know you not?

Have ye enough of this taste? or do ye yet desire a second? ye have it in
Saint Matthew, Mat. 25.30.
Projicite in tenebras exteriores, Cast the unprofitable servant into utter
darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Suppose ye were
stripped stark naked, and then bound hand and foot with iron chains, and
thrown into a deep, dark, loathsome, and hideous dungeon, full of Adders,
Vipers, Basiliskes, and Scorpions, hissing, croaking, biting, stinging you in
all parts of your body, you being not able to stir a joint, or make any
resistance at all. Are ye affrighted at this? The torment of the damned is
far worse: for the stinging of Serpents is nothing to the tormenting with
Devils; nor the darkness of a dungeon to the horror of Hell. For though there
be fire there, yet it yields no comfortable light: but as the flame in the
bush had the Exodus 3.2.
light of fire, yet not the consuming heat; so on the contrary, the flames of
Hell have the scorching heat, but not the comfortable light of fire.

As ye like this, take another taste: Mar. 9.44.
Vermis eorum non interit. Imagine that whilst ye lie in the dark dungeon bit
and stung in your outward parts, there should be a venomous worm within your
bowels, gnawing at your very heart; and upon remembrance of every heinous
sin, giving you a deadly bite: what pain and torment might this be? yet it
is nothing to that which Christ there adds, Ignis eorum non extinguitur,
Their fire is not quenched. There is none such a block, but apprehends what
unsufferable pain it is to lie soultering in the fire, or boiling in a river
of brimstone, or frying in the flames of a furnace, and crying but for one drop
of water to cool the tip of the tongue, and not obtaining it.

If these tastes affect you not, take you yet a fourth, made of the very gall
of Aspes, Apoc. 20.10. They shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
and shall be tormented for ever and ever.
Non habebunt requiem die vel nocte, sed cruciabuntur inaeternum. Each of the
former torments is of it self intolerable, and all of them most insufferable;
yet all must be endured without all means of ease, or hope of release: the
banishment is perpetual, the chains everlasting, the worm immortal, the
fire unquenchable. No loss so great as of the Kingdom of Heaven, no prison so
loathsome as the dungeon of Hell, no sight so ghastly as of the ougly fiends, no
shreeking so lamentable as of damned ghosts, no stench so loathsome as of the
lake of brimstone, no worm so biting as the remorse of conscience, no fire so
hot as the wrath of God; but such losses never to be recovered, such chains
never to be loosed, such darkness never to be enlightened, such sights never
to be removed, such noise never to be stilled, such fumes never to be
dispelled, such a worm never to be plucked off, such fire never to be quenched,
such torments never to be released, such misery never to be ended, makes up
such a punishment, as exceeds all humane eloquence to express, and patience
to endure. What shall I say more? Who of us is able to hold out long with a
vehement fit of a burning fever, or colicke, or stone, though lying in a sweet
room upon a soft bed, having the best means of physic to mitigate the
pain, and comfort of friends to strengthen our patience? If the Physician
should tell us, that after a month or a year we should be out of our extreme
fits, he would be so far from chearing us up, that he would near drive us
to despair: how then shall we be able to endure the scorching flames of the
brimstone lake in the dark dungeon of Hell, where we have no other comforters
about us than insulting Devils, or perhaps some of our dearest friends and
kindred tormented with us? Yet if these pains lasted but for a year, or an
age, or a thousand years, or the duration of the world; though so great misery
could admit of no possible comfort, yet there might be some hope: but now
after many ages and millions of years spent in this insufferable torment, to
endure as many more, and again as many more, and after all this to be nothing
nearer to the end, than at the first day of their entrance into that place of
durance: O this is able to break an heart even as hard as Adamant. Happy are
we, that we have time to think on, and means to prevent these endless pains,
for which the damned souls would give a thousand lives if they had them; and
for their neglect thereof while the time served them, they now pierce their
hearts, and rend their souls with these and the like lamentations: Woe worth
our brutish sottishness, and beastly folly, whereby for painted shows and
vanishing shadows of sinful pleasures, we have forgone everlasting joys, and
the glory of a celestial Kingdom: O that we should be so retchlesse, as never
to fore-thinke of the wretchedness we are now come to: O that we should
refuse the means freely offered unto us to escape these torments, for which
we would now give the price of our dearest hearts blood: O that we might be
released but for a while out of these torments. If we might return to life
again, what would we not do, what would we not suffer, that we might not come
to this dismal place? But alas, all is too late, the irrevocable sentence is
pronounced, the time of repentance is past; but the time of our sorrow shall
never pass. All our prayers are now fruitless, our complaints bootlesse, our
mourning regardlesse, our grief remediless, our woe comfortless, our
torments endless. If the consideration of these things move us not, beloved
brethren, we believe them not; if we believe them not, we are not what we
profess to be, that is, Christians. If there be no such torments in Hell as I
have in part described, then (which to think, and much more to utter,
deserves a thousand Hells) there is no truth in the Gospel, upon the express
Text whereof I have all this while enlarged my self. Nay, yet further, I shall
be able to demonstrate unto you, that if ye believe there is no Hell, that ye
are no men, because ye have no conscience. There is no conscience, if no
religion; no religion, if no God; no God, if no providence; no providence, if
no justice; no justice, if no torments to be endured after this life by them
who have violated all humane and divine laws, and received no condign
punishment in this world. Nature has given us an image of Hell in Aetna, and
other hills that continually burn; and of the damned, in the Salamander and
Pyrausts that live in the fire. The ancient Grecians and Romans, yea, the
Barbarous Indians, that have no learning among them, yet acknowledge a kind of
Hell; so witnesses the Relator of the Hist. Virgin. Animae immortalitatem
agnoscunt, eamque putant post mortem pro meritis transferri, aut ad deorum
seeds, aut ad ingentem sero. bem igne ardentem Popogusso dictam, quam in
extremis mundi partibus sitam ex itimant.
Virginia voyage: The Virginians (says he) acknowledge the immortality of
souls, and they believe that after death, according to their desert, they are
either translated from hence into the seats of the gods, or are carried to a
huge ditch, burning with fire, called Popogusso. An evident argument, that God
has engraven the image of Hell so deep in men's consciences, to deter them
from ungodliness, that the Devil cannot raze it clean out, though he
desires nothing more.

But I speak to Christians, with whom this reason alone is sufficient to
enforce their assent. If there be no Hell, Christ descended not into it, nor
triumphed over it. If no second death, Christ has not redeemed us from it: But
he has certainly Apoc. 20.6.
redeemed all that believe, and have part in the first resurrection. Other
things we believe, because they are so: this is undoubtedly so, if we believe
it. O what an easy condition is this, to have our debts paid for us, if by
faith we take the sum laid down for our discharge, and tender it unto God,
and be careful to run into no more arrerages? He is most worthy to lie in the
prison of Hell till he pay the uttermost farthing of his debts, who can have
them paid for him upon so easy terms, and will not.

We have looked long enough down upon Hell and Death: let us now look up to
our Savior, who triumphed over both. Let the sight of the one as much raise us
up in hope, as of the other dejecteth us in fear: let the serious meditation
upon the everlasting flames of Hell kindle in us an everlasting hate of sin,
and love of our Savior, who by his fasting has famished the worm of
conscience, that now it shall bite no more; and by his blood has quenched the
unquenchable fire in such sort, that it has no power upon any of the members
of his mystical body: and by his temporal death has delivered all that are
his from eternal. Shall we not then eternally sing his praises, who has
saved us from everlasting weeping and mourning in the valley of Hinnom? Shall
any waters of affliction quench in us the love of him, who for us quenched
unquenchable fire? Shall not the benefit of our delivery from everlasting death
ever live in our memory? Shall any thing sever us from him, who for our sakes
after a sort was severed from his Father, when he cried, Mat. 27.46.
My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Shall tribulation, or anguish, or
persecution, or famine, or the sword? No, I am persuaded I may go on with the
Apostle, and say, Romans 8 38, 39.
Neither life, nor death, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,
nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able
to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. To whom,

FERULA PATERNA. THE XLVI. SERMON.
REV. 3.19. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten.


Right Honorable, etc.
HOw unwilling the author of life and Savior of all men, especially believers,
is to pronounce and execute the sentence of death and destruction against any,
if the tears which he shed over Jerusalem, and groans and lamentations which
he powers out when he powers forth the vials of his vengeance, testify not
abundantly; yet his soft pace, and orderly proceeding by degrees in the course
he takes against obstinate and impenitent sinners, is enough to silence all
murmuring complaints wrongfully charging his justice, and raise up all dejected
spirits dolefully imploring his mercy. For he ever first sits upon his
throne of grace, and reaches out his golden Scepter to all that cast
themselves down before him (and if they have a hand of faith to lay hold on
it, he raises them up) before he takes hold of his iron rod; and he
shakes it too before he strikes with it, and he strikes lightly before he
breaks in pieces and shivers, the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction. So
true is that which he speaks of himself by the Prophet Hosea, Hos. 13.9.
O Israel thou have destroyed thy self, but in me is thy help: and the
Prophet of him, Psalm. 25.10.
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth; in which he walks thus step
by step.

First, when we begin to stray from him, he calls us back, and reclaymeth
us from our soul and dangerous ways, by friendly counsels and passionate
persuasions, by increase of temporal and promise of eternal blessings: as we
may read in the tenor of all the Prophets commissions.

2 If these kind offers be refused with contempt, and greater benefits repayed
with greater unthankfulness, he changes his note, but not his affections; he
exprobrates to us our unthankfulness, that it might not prove a bar of his
bounty: Hos. 11, 3, 4.
I taught Ephraim to go, taking them by their arms, and they knew not that I
healed them, I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love, and I was
to them as they that take off the yoke from their jaws. and, Isa. 5.2.
My Beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill, and he fenced it, and he
gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest Vine, and
built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepresse therein, and he
looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

3 If exprobrations and sharp reproves will not serve the turn, he falls to
threatening and menacing fearful punishments, but to this end only, that he
may not inflict what he threateneth, as we see in Niniveh's case, Jonah 3.4.
Yet forty days, says the Prophet, and Niniveh shall be overthrown: yet
Niniveh was not overthrown; Verse. 10.
because the Ninivites repented of their works, and turned from their evil
ways, God repented of the evil he had said that he would do unto them, and
he did it not.

4 If neither promises of mercies, nor threats of judgments; neither kind
entreaties, nor sharp rebukes can work upon the hard heartedness of
obstinate sinners, he uses yet another means to bring them home; he takes
away their goods that they may come to him for them; he pincheth them with
famine, that he may starve their wanton lusts; he strikes their flesh with a
smart rod, that it may awake their souls out of a dead sleep of security: and
this for the most part is the last knock at their hearts, at which if they
open not, and receive Christ by unfeigned repentance and a lively faith, the
gates of mercy are for ever locked up against them.

According to this method Christ here proceeds with the Angel of Laodicea:
First, V. 15.
he friendly saluteth him: next, V. 16. Ver. 17. Ver. 18.
he sharply reproves him: then he fearfully threatens him: lastly, he
severely chastises him, and all in love, as you hear in this verse, (As many
as I love I rebuke and chasten). Which has this coherence with the former,
wherein Christ taxed two vices in this Angel, luke warmness, and spiritual
pride; against these he prescribes two remedies, zeal, verse. 19. and
spiritual providence: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,
that thou may be rich; and white raiment that thou may be clothed, and
that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with
eye salve that thou may see.

But here because the Angel of Laodicea might reply, Alas, to what end is all
this? what prescribe you unto memedicinal potions, who am to be spewed out of
Gods mouth? what can your counsel do me good? my doom is already past, and
my heart within me is like melted wax: Christ opportunely in the words of my
text solveth this objection, and gives him a cordial to keep him from
fainting; Be not too much discouraged at my sharp rebukes, nor faint under my
fatherly chastisements: for I use no other discipline toward thee than toward
my dearest children, whom I love most entirely, and yet rebuke most sharply to
break them of their ill qualities. I chasten those, and those only, and all
those whom I love; and I chasten oftenest whom I love best: wherefore faint
not, but be zealous; neither despair, but amend, and thou shall find my
affection as much enlarged, and the treasury of my bounty as open unto thee as
ever heretofore.

Behold then in the words of this Scripture, 1 A rule of direction to those
that are set in high places of authority. 2 A staff of comfort to those who
are fallen into the depth of grief and misery.


To the former the Spirit speaks in the words of my text on this wise. Ye
Masters of servants, Tutors of Scholars, Fathers of children, Magistrates of
cities, and Kings of realms, who have received your authority from God, be
ruled by him by whom ye rule, take him for a president in your proceedings
from whom ye have your warrant: he first convinces, then reproves, after
threatens, and lastly chastises those, and all those whom he loves: do ye
likewise, first evidently convince, then openly rebuke, after severely
threaten, and last of all fatherly chasten with moderation and compassion all
those, indifferently, without partiality, who deserve chastisement, not sparing
those who are most dear and near unto you.

But to the bruised reed, to the drouping conscience overwhelmed with sorrow
and grief both for sins and the punishment thereof, the Spirit speaks in
the words of my text on this wise. Why do ye add affliction to your
affliction, and fret and exulcerate your own wounds through your impatience? It
is not (as ye conceive) your enemy that has prevailed against you; it is not
a cursed Master, or a racking Landlord, or a partial Magistrate, or an envious
neighbor that wreakes his spleen and malice upon you; but it is your heavenly
Father that strikes you, and he strikes you but gently, and with a small
ferular; neither offers he you any harder measure than the rest of his
children, so he nurtureth them all. Neither are ye cast quite out of favor,
though cast down for the present; nay, be it spoken for your great comfort,
ye are no less in favor than when your estate was entire which now is
broken, and your day cleerest which is now overcast. Ye are so far from
being utterly rejected and abandoned by your heavenly father, that ye are by
this your seasonable affliction more assured of his care over you, and love
unto you. For he never says, As many as I love I smile upon, or I wink at
their faults, but, I rebuke and chasten: whom he less cares for he
suffers to play the trivants, and take their pleasure; but he nurtureth and
corrects you whom he intends to make his heirs, yea joint heirs with his
best beloved Christ Jesus. Therefore submit your souls under his mighty hand in
humble patience, and after that raise them up in a comfortable hope, kiss his
rod, quae corpus vulnerat, mentem sanat, which wounds the body, but heals
the soul; makes the flesh peradventure black and blew, but the spirit fair
and beautiful. Arguite and castigate vos ipsos, convince your own folly,
rebuke your bad courses, chasten your wanton flesh with watching, fasting and
other exercises of mortification; confess your faults, and grieve not so much
because ye are stricken, as that ye should deserve to be so stricken by him:
then will the affection of a father so work with him, that he will break his
ferular, and burn his rod wherewith he has beaten you, and the overflowing
of his future favors will make it evident, that whatsoever was said or done
before, was in love, to make you partakers of his holiness, and more capable
of celestial happiness. Wherefore let all that mourn in Zion, and sigh as
often as they breath for their many and grievous visitations, hear what the
Spirit says to the Angel of Laodicea, I rebuke and chasten as many as I love.

Spices pounded and beaten small smell most sweetly; and Texts of Scripture
yield a most fragrant savor of life, when they are expounded and broken into
parts; which are here evidently four: 1 The person of Christ, I. 2 The actions
of this person, Rebuke and chasten. 3 The subject of these actions, As many. 4
The extent of the subject, As I love.
1 The person most gracious, I. 2 The actions most just, Rebuke and chasten. 3
The subject most remarkable, Whom I love. 4 The extent most large, As many.
1 In the person you may see the author of all afflictions. 2 In the actions,
the nature of all afflictions. 3 In the extent, the community of all
afflictions. 4 In the subject, the cause of all afflictions.


Of this extent of the subject, subject of the actions, actions of Christ, by
his gracious assistance, and your Christian patience: and first of the person,

1. That in all afflictions of the servants of God, God is the principal
agent, and has Isa. 45.7. I make peace, and create evil.
the greatest stroke, needs not so much evident demonstration, as serious
consideration, and right and seasonable application in time of fearful
visitations. For what passage can we light upon at all adventures, especially
in the writings of the Prophets, where we find not either God threatening, or
the Church bewailing afflictions, and sore chastisements? Amos 3.6.
Is there any evil in the city which I have not done, says the Lord? And,
Lam. 1.12.
Is there any sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord has afflicted me
in the day of his fierce wrath, says his captive Spouse? What face of misery
so ugly and ghastly, wherewith he scareth not his disobedient people? To them
that have hard hearts, and brazen brows that cannot blush, he threaneth to
make Lev. 26.19.
the earth as iron, and the heaven as brass: he martials all his plagues
against them, sword, famine, pestilence, stings of serpents, teeth of wild
beasts, blasting, mildew, botches, blaines, and what not? And according as he
threatens in the law, he professes that he had done to the Israelites in the
days of the Prophet Amos: Amos 4.6.7, 8, 9, 10.
I have sent you cleanness of teeth, and scarcity of bread in all your coasts,
and yet ye have not returned unto me: also I have withholden the rain from
you, and yet ye have not returned. I have smitten you with blasting and
mildew; your gardens and vineyards the valmer-worme has devoured, and yet ye
have not returned unto me. Pestilence I have sent you, after the manner of the
Egyptians, and your young men I have slain with the sword, and yet ye have
not returned unto me. I have overthrown you as God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand out of the burning, and yet ye have not
returned unto me. There being a double evil as the Schools distinguish, Malum
1. Culpae. 2. Poenae.
the evil of sin, and the evil of punishment: to make him the author of the
former, and to deny him to be the author of the later, is a like impiety. For
the former error impeacheth his purity and sanctity, the later his justice and
providence. It is true, that in the afflicting of his children, God sometimes
uses none of the best Job 1.2. 2 Cor. 12.7. Hieron. lib. de vir. illustr. in
Ignat. De Syria ad Romam pugno, ad bestias in mari and in terra, ligatus cum
12. Leopardis, hoc est, militibus qui me custodiunt, quibus si benefeceris
pejores sunt, iniquitas eorum mea doctrina est.
instruments, neither do they intend what God does in laying heavy crosses
upon his children: yet he keeps their malice within such compass, that they
can do nothing, but what God for just causes permits them to do. God has
Satan and all his instruments like Mastiffs tied in a chain, they cannot go
beyond their tether; he lets them loose, and calls them in at his pleasure.
If God be at peace with us, Psalm. 34.20.
not a bone shall be broken: nay, not a Mat. 10.30.
hair of our head shall fall. The four Angels in the Apoc. 7.3.
Apocalypse had not power to touch the earth, or any tree, till Gods servants
were sealed.

If this be so, what security does the fear of God bring to man! and what a
Potentate is the feeblest Christian on earth! Qui Deum timet, omnia timent eum;
qui Deum non timet, timet omnia: He which fears not God, has cause to fear
all things; for all the creatures will take their Makers part against him: on
the contrary, he that fears God, all things fear him; for nothing dares or
can do him hurt. Surely no Prince or Emperor could ever so secure his state,
or guard his person, that neither outward power could annoy him, nor homebred
treachery surprise him: yet neither rebel, nor pyrate, nor rich, nor poor,
nor open enemy, nor counterfeit friend, nor principality, nor power, nor man,
nor devil can touch Gods children, protected by his omnipotency, and guarded
by his holy Angels, except they turn rebels to God, and traitors to
themselves. For no evil can come near them, while God is near them; and God
will be ever near them, if they depart not from him.

2. Has God a hand in all the strokes of his children? let us not then so
much fret and fume at the immediate agents, or rather instruments, as we do.
It is all one, as if a Noble man sentenced by the King or his Peers to lose
his head, should fall foul upon the Heads-man, or pick a quarrel with the
axe: or as if a patient, to whom a wise Physician has prescribed a bitter
potion for the recovery of his health, should fall out with the Apothecary for
ministering it: Nay, it is like to them that use the unguentum called Armarium,
who when a party is wounded by his adversary with a sword or spear, apply
nothing to the party, but anoint the instrument. I speak not this to justify
or excuse the malice, or iniquity, or cruelty of those in whose hands God
puts his scourge for us, if they exceed his prescript, and rather exercise
their own passions, than execute his judgments. For as God is no way
accessory to their cruelty; so neither do they participate of Gods
righteousness in afflicting his children: and as God has made them now
instruments, so he will hereafter make them subjects of his justice: as a
tender mother, after she has beat her infant, casts the rod in the fire; so
God deals with these men. The Assyrians were his rod wherewith he chastened
the Israelites; the Persians his rod wherewith he chastened the Assyrians; the
Grecians his rod wherewith he chastened the Persians; the Roman Emperors the
rod wherewith he chastened the Grecians: and now all four rods one after
another are cast into the fire.

But my aim is to persuade you to look higher than the executioners and
ministers of Gods vengeance; and when ye see that he sits in heaven who
orders and appoints how many strokes shall be given to you; who has not
only a glass to keep every drop of blood that is drawn from you, but also a
Psalm. 56.8.
bottle to keep every tear that falls from your eyes, to struggle with the
infirmity of your flesh, and endeavor to the uttermost of your power to suffer
his will, because ye have not done it; and to make the best amends ye can, to
supply the defect of your active obedience by your passive. Holy Job could
discern Gods arrows, though in the hand of Satan; and his hand, though on
the arms of the Sabean robbers: and therefore when he was stripped of all his
goods, even by the worst of men, he curses not the instruments, but blesses
God, saying: Job 1.21.
Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked shall I return thither again;
the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.
What Christ spoke to Pilate vaunting of the power and authority he had over
him, the feeblest Christian in the world may reply to the greatest Potentate on
earth: John 19.10, 11.
Thou could have no power at all against me, unless it were given thee from
above. Wicked and ungodly men may have a will of themselves to vex, hurt, and
persecute Gods children; yet power they can have none, so much as to take a
hair from their head, unless it be given them from above by God, who can and
does sometimes execute his just judgments by unjust ministers; and though they
intend evil and mischief against his servants, yet he will turn it into
Genesis 50.20. As for you, you thought evil against me, but God turned it unto
good.
good to them, as he did to Joseph. Solinus writes of Solin. c. 20. Hypanis
Scythicorum amnium princeps haustu saluberrimus, dum in Exampeum inferatur, qui
amnem suo vitio vertit.
Hypanis, that the water thereof is very bitter as it passes through Exampeus,
yet very sweet in the spring; so the cup of trembling, which is offered to the
children of God, is often very bitter at the second hand, as it is ministered
unto them by profane persons, haters, and despisers of their graces: yet it is
sweet at the first hand, as it is sent them down from heaven.

3. Are the afflictions which befall Gods children in their bodies, souls,
good name, or estates, darts shot from heaven? how then can they avoid them?
what shall they do in this case? Surely cast themselves on the ground, and
hold up their buckler of faith, saying with Job 13.15.
Job: Though he slay me, yet will I put my trust in him. And with the Psalm.
44.17, 18, 19.
Israelites, All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee: our
heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; though
thou have sore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the
shadow of death. Or cast up our darts to heaven, that is, our ejaculatory
prayers, as Psalm. 38.1, 2, 9.
David does: O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thy
hot displeasure: for thine arrows stick fast in me, and thine hand presses
me sore. Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from
thee. When a great Philosopher was taxed for not holding out his argument with
Adrian the Emperor, but presently giving up the bucklers, his apology for
himself was, Is it not reason to yield to him, who has thirty legions at his
command? I am sure there is greater reason, whatsoever the cause may be in our
apprehension, absolutely to yield without further disputing, to him who has
more than thirty legions of Angels at his command, and all the creatures in
heaven and earth besides. There is no contesting with sovereignty, no resisting
omnipotency, no striving with our Maker. The fish that is caught with the
hook, the more he jerkes and flings, the faster hold the hook takes on him:
the harder a man kickes against the pricks, the deeper they enter into his
heels. An earthen pitcher the more forcibly it is dashed against an iron pot,
the sooner it flies in pieces: in like manner, the more we contend against God
and his judgments, the more we hurt, wound, and in the end destroy our selves.
Wherefore let us not like dogs bite the stone, never looking upon him that
flingeth it: but mark him who aims at us, and hitteth us, and lay our hands on
our mouth with Psalm. 39.9.
David, saying, I held my peace, because thou Lord have done it. The Persian
Nobles, as Annot. in Tacit.
Janus Gruterus reports, accounted it an exceeding great grace to be scourged
by their Prince; and though it were painful to them, yet they seemed much to
rejoice at it, thanking him that he would take pains with them, and minister
correction unto them himself: and shall we not much more praise the divine
Majesty, that he vouchsafes himself to chasten us for our good? The wounds
of a friend are more welcome to us than the plasters of an enemy: and a sick
patient, who will not endure a bitter potion offered him by a Physician, yet
oftentimes takes it from the hands of his most endeared spouse, or a beloved
friend: and shall not all Gods children, sick of too much prosperity,
willingly take the bitter, yet most wholesome, potion of affliction from the
hand of the Father of spirits? Saint Paul shall close up the doctrine: When 1
Cor. 11.32.
we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned
with the world: and Saint Peter the use: 1 Pet. 4.19.
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the
keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

From the person I proceed to his actions, rebuke and chasten, not condemn and
punish, (...); verba virtutem non addunt, soft words make smart blows
nevertheless felt: if the strokes be as many, and inflicted with equal
force, whether ye call it chastening or punishing, all is one to the poor
patient. Indeed were there but a verbal difference, and not a real between
punishing and chastening, this note would little better the music; but if ye
look more narrowly into the words, ye shall find in them many and material
differences. In punishing ye shall observe a Judge, in chastening a Father: in
punishment a satisfying of justice, in chastisement a testifying of love: in
punishment a compensation of desert, in chastisement a mitigation of favor: in
punishment a principal respect had to a former offense, in chastisement to
future amendment. A Judge principally regards the wrong done to the law, and
therefore proportioneth his punishment to the quality of the offense: but a
father, whom not love of law and justice, but the law of love moves and after
a sort enforces to do what he does for his childs good, is contented with
such correction, not as he deserves for the fault he has committed, but that
which he hops will serve for his amendment: Pro magno peccato parum supplicii
satis est patri. In brief, this word Castigo, I chasten, how much soever at
the first it affrighteth us, yet it affords us this comfortable doctrine,
That God as a father inflicteth with grief and compassion, moderateth with
mercy, and directs by providence all the strokes that are laid upon his
children.

1. He inflicteth with grief and compassion: O Hos. 6.4.
Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, how shall I entreat thee? my
bowels erne within me, and my repentings roll together: and, For the Jer. 9.10.
mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of
the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burnt up, so that none can
pass through them, neither can men hear the voice of the cattle, both the
foul of the heavens, and the beast are fled, they are gone. Mic. 1.8, 9.
I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing
like the Dragons, and mourning as the Owls: for her wound is incurable.

2. He mitigateth with mercy his childrens payment, 1. In respect of time, 1.
Indefinitely. 2. Definitely.
2. In respect of the grievousnesse of their strokes.
He mitigateth in respect of time indefinitely: In a little Esa. 54, 7, 8.
wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with everlasting kindness
will I have mercy on thee, says the Lord thy Redeemer. For a small moment have
I forsaken thee, but with great mercy will I gather thee: and, The God of all 1
Pet. 5.10.
grace, who has called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that
ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.
Sometimes he prescribes the definite time; as to Genesis 41.1.
Joseph for his imprisonment two years: to the Jer. 25.11. They shall serve the
King of Babel seventy years.
Jews for their captivity seventy years: to Dan. 4.25.
Nebuchadnezzar for his humiliation seven years: to the Apoc. 2.10. Ye shall
have tribulation ten days.
Angel of Smyrna ten days. And as he mitigateth their sufferings in respect of
the time, so also in respect of the grievousnesse of their punishment: The Lord
has Psa. 118.18
severely chastened me, says David, but he has not given me over unto
death. God he is 1 Cor. 10.13.
faithful, and will not suffer his children to be tempted above their strength.

3. He directs by his providence and fatherly wisdom all the crosses that
are laid upon his children to special ends for their good: namely, to cure
their dullness and stupidity, abate their pride, tame their wanton flesh,
exercise their patience, inflame their devotion, try their love, weane their
desires from this world, and breed in them a longing for the joys of heaven,
and fruits of Paradise. Prosperity flattereth the soul, but trouble and
affliction play the parts of true friends: they rightly inform us of the
insufficiency of all worldly comforts, which leave us in our extremities, and
can stand us in no stead at our greatest need. And therefore S. Bernard very
well resembles them to rotten stakes, flags, and bull-rushes, which men catch
at that are in peril of drowning, hoping by them to scramble out of the water:
but alas, it falls out far otherwise; these help them not at all, nor bear
them above water, but are drawn down under water with them. This most serious
lesson of the vanity of earthly delights and worldly comforts, we read in many
Texts of Scriptures, hear in diverse Sermons, see in daily spectacles of men
troubled in mind at their death: yet we never thoroughly apprehend it, till
Gods rod has imprinted it in our bodies and souls: then finding by our woeful
experience, that earthly felicity is nothing but misery masked in gaudy shows,
and that all the wealth of the world, together with all carnal delights,
cannot ease a burdened conscience, nor abate any whit of our pain, we begin
to distaste them all, we grow out of love with this life, and entertain death
in our most serious thoughts. Here the eye of faith, enlightened by divine
revelation, sees beyond death the celestial Paradise, and in it a crystal
Apoc. 22.1, 2.
river of the water of life, and by it a tree of life, which bears twelve
sorts of fruits: and besides these a heavenly City, shining with Apoc. 21.18,
19.
streets of gold, and foundations of pearl and precious stones, the sight
whereof leaves an unspeakable delight in the soul, which sweetneth all
temporal afflictions, and stirs up in us an unspeakable desire of those
solid comforts and substantial joys. Ramus in orat.
Heliogabalus was wont to set before his parasites a banquet painted on cloth,
or carved in wood, or cut in stone; and whatsoever he fed upon in truth, they
had drawn before them in pictures and images: such are the joys and delights
which the Devil and the World presents unto us, false, shadowie, and vain.
The true are to be found no where but in heaven, where those joys are in
substance, which we have here but in shadows: Aug. confess. l. 2. c. 5.
Fornicatur anima, quae avertitur abs te, and quaerit extra te ea quae pura and
liquida non invenit, nisi cum redit ad te.
pure, which we have here polluted: full, which we have here empty: sincere,
which we have here mixed: perpetually flourishing, which we have here
continually fading: to these substantial, full, pure, sincere, everlasting
joys, God bring us for his Son Jesus Christ his sake. Cui, etc.

THE NURTURE OF CHILDREN. THE XLVII. SERMON.
APOC. 3.19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.


Right Honorable, etc.
THat which Pliny writes, and experience confirms concerning hony-combes,
that the thinner and weaker honey runs out of them at the first, but the
thickest and best is pressed and squeezed out of them at the last; we find for
the most part in handling Texts of holy Scripture, compared by the Prophet
Psalm. 19.10.
David to hony-combs, the easier and more vulgar observations flow out of them
upon the lightest touch, but we are to press each phrase and circumstance
before we can get out the thickest honey, the choicest and most useful
doctrines of inspired wisdom. The more we suck these combs, the more we
may, the honey proves the sweeter, the comb the moister; and, which is nothing
less to be admired, the spiritual taste is no way cloyed therewith. Wherefore
with your good liking and approbation, I will press again and again these
mellifluous combs in our Saviors lips, dropping celestial doctrine sweeter
than honey, to delight the most distempered taste, and sharper than it, to
cleanse the most putrefied sore. I rebuke and chasten; there is the sharpness,
and as it were the searching virtue of honey: As many as I love, there is the
sweetness.

Parallel Texts of Scripture, like glasses set one against another, cast a
mutual light: such is this Text, and that Deuteronomy. 8.5. Thou shall also consider
in thy heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God
chasteneth thee: and, Job 5.17. Despise not thou the chastening of the
Almighty: and, Prove. 3.11, 12. My son, despise not the chastening of the
Lord, neither be weary of his correction: for whom the Lord loves, he
corrects, even as a father does the son in whom he delights: and, Hebr.
12.7. If ye endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons: for what
son is he whom the father chasteneth not? As a Musician often touches upon
the sweetest note in his song, Paven or Galliard; so does the holy Spirit upon
this: and therefore we ought more especially to listen to it. For,

1. It convinces the Papists, who overvalue crosses and afflictions,
accounting the bearing of them satisfactions for sins. For with a like pride,
whereby they cry up their actions to be meritorious, they would improve their
passions to be works satisfactory (by satisfactory intending such as make
amends unto the justice of God) wherein they as much overreach, as they
supererogate, or rather superarrogate in the former. Satisfactions to our
brethren for wrongs done unto them, by restitution, mulct or acknowledgement of
our fault, with asking forgiveness for it, we both teach and practice: but
they shall never be able to satisfy us in this point, that any thing they can
do or suffer, can satisfy God. Neither can our actions satisfy his law, nor
our penal sufferings his justice: none can satisfy for sin, but he that was
without sin: nothing can recompense an infinite transgression, but an
infinite submission, or to speak more properly, the submission and passion of
him that was infinite. It cost more to redeem sins than the world is worth:
and therefore they must let that alone for him, who Esaias 63.3.
trod the wine press alone. Before, I noted the difference between
chastisement and punishment, in the one a compensation of wrong done to the
person or law, is intended; in the other a testifying of love, and a care of
amendment of the party chastened. Who would ever be so unreasonable, as to
think, that a few stripes given by a tenderhearted father to the child whom
he most dearly affects, were a satisfaction for the loss of a Diamond of
great price? yet our sufferings hold not such a proportion. For what are our
finite and momentary sufferings to the offense given to an infinite Majesty?
Nothing can be set in the other scale against it to weigh it down, but the
manifold sufferings of an equal and infinite person, the eternal Son of
God. Neither will it help our adversaries any whit to say, that Christ
satisfied for the eternal, but not for the temporal punishment of our sins.
For this is all one as to say, that our Redeemer laid down a talent of gold
for us, yet not a brass token: or paid many millions of pounds, yet not a
piece. The Apostle said, he gave himself a 1 Timothy 2.6.
ransom for all: will they deny it to be a sufficient one? or was there any
defect in his good intention? They have not rubbed their foreheads so hard, as
to affirm any such thing. Well then, let them tell us how that man is
perfectly ransomed by another, who is still kept in prison till he have
discharged part of his ransom himself. This very conceit, that they merit by
their actions, or satisfy by their passions, takes away not only all merit,
but all worth from them both.

2. It instructs the penitent: for if afflictions are (...), discipline and
nurture, then somewhat is to be learned by them. It is good for me, says
Psalm. 119.71.
David, that I was in trouble, that I might learn thy statutes. Blessed is he,
says Saint Greg. mor. in Job c. 5. v. 17.
Gregory, who is chastened of the Lord, Quia eruditur ad beatitudinem; because
he is set in the right way to blessedness. The Greeks say in their Proverb,
(...), and the Latins answer them both in the rhyme and reason, Nocumenta
documenta, that is, we gain wit by our losses, and the rod imprinteth learning
into us. What we learn in particular by it, I shall God willing declare at
large hereafter: this lesson shall suffice for the present, That as a loving
father never beats his child without a fault, so neither does God chasten us
without a cause: our sins are the cords which furnish his whip. Lam. 3.39. Man
suffers for his sin.
It is true that sin is not the adaequate or only cause for which God
strikes his children, yet is it always causa sine qua non, a cause without
which he never strikes them. Joh. 9.3.
Although neither the blind man his sin, nor his fathers were the cause why
he was borne blind more than other men, but that through the miraculous cure
of his blindness all might see the divine power of Christ; yet certain it is
that he and his father for their sins deserved it or a greater punishment.
Likewise Jobs sins were not the cause why the arrows of the Almighty fell
thicker upon him than any other, but it was to make him a rare mirror of
patience, and convince Satan of his false slander, and to take occasion of
crowning him with greater blessings in this life, and everlastingly rewarding
him hereafter; yet Job denies not that those calamities fell justly upon him:
Job 7.20.
I have sinned, says he, O Lord, what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver
of men?

3 It comfort all that are afflicted: there are as many arguments of comfort
in it, as words of arguments. Is any man either impoverished with losses, or
visited with sickness, or stricken with soars, or oppressed with heavy
burdens, or pined with famine, or grieved with death of friends, or affrighted
with terrors of conscience? let him lay this text of holy writ to his heart,
and it will presently assuage his pain, and in the end, if not cure his
malady, yet make it sufferable, yea and comfortable also to him. Let him thus
question with himself: Who afflicts me? It is answered, God, I. How
proceeds he to afflict? After warning, and upon conviction, (...), rebuke.
What are afflictions? chastisements, and chasten. Whom does he thus afflict?
only some stubborn and obstinate sinners, or desperate cast-a-wayes? nay, but
all his children, as many. Why afflicts he? Because he loves them. I. It is
God that smites me, can I resist his power? must I not obey his will? Rebuke.
He has given me warning before, and I suffer but what I deserve: Quae venit
ex merito poena ferenda venit. Chasten. He inflicteth with grief, moderateth
with love, guides with fatherly providence what he orders me to suffer;
shall I refuse nurture, and show my self a bastard and no son? had I rather
he should leave me to my self, to follow my own courses, according to the
bent of my corrupt nature, with a purpose to deprive me of his glory, and
dis-inherite me of his kingdom? As many. He disciplineth all his children, am
I better than all the rest? As I love. His only motive herein is his love, and
shall I take that ill which is sent to me in love? shall I be afraid of, and
refuse love tokens? shall I be grieved and dismayed because I have now more
sensible experience of his care and love than ever before? To join all
together, to make of them all a strong bulwark against impatiency in all sorts
of afflictions and tribulations: Shall we either stubbornly refuse, or
ungraciously despise, or take unkindly after all fair means by us
sleightened, the deserved chastisement of our heavenly father, which with great
moderation and greater grief, he inflicteth upon all his dearest children in
love? Can we justly repine at any thing offered us upon these terms? is not
this salve of the spirit alone of it self able to allay the most swelling
tumor of the greatest hearts grief? I rebuke and chasten as many as I love.

Rebuke and chasten. So does the Translatour render (...), truly and answerably
to the main intent of the Spirit, but not fully and agreeably to the nature of
the letter: we have no one English word capable of the whole contents of the
two words in the original.

(...) primarily signifies to evict or convince, to give evidence of any thing
or against any person, to lay his sins open before him, in such sort that he
cannot but see them, and be ashamed of them; as in these passages, Heb. 11.1.
(...), Ephesians. 5.11.
and, (...), Psalm. 50.21. Bud (...).
and, (...): Faith is the evidence of things not seen; and, I will rebuke
thee, and set thy sins in order before thy face; and, Have no fellowship with
the unfruitful works of darkness, but by the light of truth discover and
openly rebuke them. Likewise (...) is a word much more pregnant than chasten;
and, if you will have it in one word expressed, is, I nurture, or, I
discipline: for the word implies as well instruction as correction. Now out of
the nature of the phrase, which signifies to rebuke upon conviction, or
evidently convince by reproof, and the order of the words, first rebuke, and
then chasten, All Judges and Ministers of justice are lessoned to be better
instructed and informed in the causes they sentence, than usually they are; to
sift matters to the very bran, to weigh all circumstances together before they
give judgment. For to reprove without cause deserves reproof, to censure
without a fault deserves censure, and to punish without conviction deserves
punishment. Fulgent. ad Monimum. Ipsa justitia, si puniendum reum non
invenerit, sed fecerit, injusta est.
Punishing justice if it fall not upon a party legally convicted, is it self
injustice, and punishable in a Magistrate. Now that they who are in authority
may not exercise injustice in stead of executing justice,

1 They must indifferently hear both parties. Philip kept an ear always for
the defendant: Orat. de coron. in prooem. (...).
Demosthenes in his famous oration for Ctesiphon, puts the Athenian Judges
in mind of this, which he calls the first law of equity, to hear both the
plaintiff and defendant with indifferency. For as Senec. in Trag. Qui aliquid
statuerit part inaudita altera, aequum licet statuerit, haud aequus est.
Seneca says truly, He that gives a right judgment without hearing both
parties, is no righteous Judge: and therefore Suet. in Claud. Pronunciabat
saepe altera part audita, saepe neutra.
Suetonius justly charge Claudius with injustice, for precipitating his
sentence before he had given a full hearing to both parties, nay sometimes to
either.

2 They must lay all that they hear, and what is brought on both sides, in an
even balance, and poyse them together: Res cum re, causa cum causa, ratio cum
ratione concertet; by the collision of arguments on both sides the fire of
truth is struck out. Protagoras his exception was good against them, who to
prove the providence of their paynim gods, brought a number painted in a Table
of them that calling upon them escaped shipwreck: At picti non sunt, inquit,
qui naufragio perierunt; True, says he, but none of those who notwithstanding
their prayers to them suffered shipwreck, are any where painted, neither is
there any register kept of them.

3 They must maturely advise, and seriously consider of the matter before they
pass sentence. The eye unless it be fixed upon the object, cannot perfectly
discern it, nor distinguish it from things that are near and like unto it.
And howsoever in a clear water we may easily perceive any thing that is in the
bottom, yet if it be troubled we cannot: and in every Court there are many
troublers of the water, the Lawyers by their wrangling, and the witnesses by
their varying, the Judges by their different opinions, (to speak nothing of
Angels also troubling the clear stream of justice at certain times.)

4 The eyes of their judgment must be free from all mists of prejudice, and
clouds of affection. For as that which a man looks upon through red or green
glass, seems to be of that color the glass is of, though it be of a far
different, if not a contrary: so that which we judge out of a forestalled
conceit, or prejudicate opinion, seems to answer to our opinion of it, how
contrary soever it be. The Roman soldiers, as Div. instit. l. 1.
Lactantius notes, thought verily that the goddess worshipped at Syracuse,
being demanded whether she would be carried by them to Rome, answered, that
she would: not that the image spoke any such word, but because they were
before strongly persuaded that the goddess would give such an answer. Unless
those that sit in judgment observe these rules, they may easily take (...) for
(...), a fallacy for a demonstration, and a malicious calumniation for a legal
conviction. If their eyes be either dim with private affection, or blinded
with rewards, or wink through carelessness, or are shut through wilfulness;
that will fall out which S. L. 2. ep. 2. Inter leges ipsas delinquitur, inter
jura peccatur, innocentia nec illic ubi defenditur reservatur, qui sedet
crimina vindicaturus, admittit; and ut reus innocens pereat, sit nocens judex.
Cyprian so grievously complains of, Injustice sits in the place of
justice, and even in the sight of the laws, hanging about the judgment, seat
the laws are broken: the Judge who sits to revenge wrongs offered, offers
that which he should revenge, and commits that which he should punish (and
has his conscience colored with sins of a deeper dye than the scarlet of
his robes.) The Empress wisely advised her husband, when sitting at play, and
minding (as it seems) that more than the cause before him, he rashly
pronounced sentence; Non est vita hominum ludus talorum, The sitting upon life
and death is not like the playing a game at Tables, where a Table-man of wood
is taken up by a blot, and thrown aside without any great loss; the life of
man is of more worth than so. Though all men detested Seianus, and that most
deservedly, yet when they heard him adjudged to a most cruel and infamous
death by no legal proceedings or course of justice, the hate of all men
recoyled back upon the Judges, and the people began to pity that great
favorite, who before was most odious: Crepat ingens Seianus, great Seianus is
drawn upon an hurdle, and he suffers for too much abusing his Princes
favor. Juven. sat. 9.
-- Sed quo cecidit sub crimine? quisnam
Delator? quibus indiciic? quo test probavit? etc.
Nil horum: Verbosa and grandis epistola venit
A Capreis. Been habet, nil plus interrogo. --
What crime was laid to his charge? what evidence was given in against him?
what witnesses were sworn? I hear of none: only I hear of a long letter
sent from the Emperor, taking his pastime at the Capreae. Hush, not a word
more. Who does not observe in our own Chronicles how God met to Hastings his
own measure, who the same day that the Earl Rivers, Gray, and others, in the
reign of Edward the fourth, without trial of law, were by his advice executed
at Pomfret, had his head stricken off in the same manner in the Tower of
London? Such as Tiberius his Judges, or Edward the fourth's, are no fit
Presidents for Christian Magistrates; this (...) in my text will evidently
convince them at Christ's tribunal in the clouds, for not looking better to
their evidence when they sat on the bench here below: let them therefore take
judicii praefidem for a president in their judgments, even God himself; who,
as we Genesis 18.20.
read, though the sin of Sodom were exceeding great, and the cry of it went
up to heaven, yet came down from heaven to see whether they had done according
to that cry, Chrysostom. in Genesis
before he rained down fire and brimstone, to burn their bodies with
unnatural fire, whose souls burned with unnatural lust.

As the word (...), I rebuke, rebukes the carelessness and rashness of Judges
and Magistrates, in giving sentence upon the life or state of any in question
before them: so the other word, (...), I instruct by chastening, instructs
fathers and mothers to perform that duty which they owe to God, and must
perform to their children, viz. before them continually to rehearse the law of
God, Deuteronomy. 11.19. and 4 10.
To talk of it when they are in their house, and when they walk abroad, when
they lie down, and when they rise up. Above all things they must take care to
season their young and tender years with pure and incorrupt religion, and bring
them up in the fear of God: otherwise they are but half parents, if they have
not as well a care of their souls as of their bodies; if they pamper the flesh
in them, but starve the spirit; if they labor not to be Gods instruments for
their eternal, as they have been for their temporal life. Doubtless Pro.
1.8.
Solomon, who injoineth children to hear their fathers instruction, and not to
forsake the law of their mother, because they shall be as an ornament of grace
unto their head, and chains about their neck, implies in the duty of
children to receive, the duty of parents to give them such instructions and
laws. What years fitter to lay the ground color of virtue and true religion,
Quint. instit. orat. l. 1. c. 1 Sapor quo nova imbuis diutissime durat. Horat.

than those which are the more capable thereof, because as yet without any
tincture at all? when better forming the mould of the heart and affections than
when it is softest? and who rather to do it than a father, whose workmanship
next after God the child is? If it have any blemish or deformity of body, be
it a scar in the face, or stammering in the tongue, or wrinesse in the neck,
or disproportion in any limb, what will not a tender hearted parent do to
take away such a blemish, and rectify such a distortion? All children are
borne with worser deformities in their soul than these imperfections are in
their body, and yet how few parents take them to heart? Scarce one of an
hundred attends upon Gods ordinance, and uses the means therein prescribed
to cure the natural blindness of ignorance, or to purge the dregs of
concupiscence in them, or to break them of many ill customs and habites
growing upon them. If children stammer out good words, or pronounce them
lispingly, their fathers and mothers are offended at it, and rebuke them for
it; but if they speak plainly and distinctly their words, though they be
never so rotten and unsavory, they make much of them for it: Verba ne
Alexandrinis quidem permittenda deliciis, risu and osculo excipiunt. Hence it
comes to pass that they can speak ill before they can well speak, and
drinke-in many vices with their mothers milk, and get such ill customs and
habites, which afterward when, they would, they cannot leave; because,
according to our true Proverb, That will never out of the flesh which is bread
in the bone. It would touch the quickest veins in the heart of a Christian
Parent, to hear what a grievous complaint diverse children made against their
fathers and mothers in Cyp. ser. de lap. Nos nihil fecimus, nec derelicto cibo
and poculo Dei, ad profanas contagiones sponte properavimus, perdidit nos
aliena perfidia, parents sensimus parricidas, illi nobis Deum patrem, and
ecclesiam matre^ abnegarunt.
S. Cyprian his days. Alas, what have we done that we are thus pitifully
tormented? The negligence, or treachery, or misguided zeal of our parents has
brought all this misery upon us; we perish through others default; our fathers
and mothers have proved our murderers; they that gave us our natural life
bereaved us of a better, by depriving us of the wholesome nourishment of the
Word, and giving us a scorpion in stead of fish; they plunged us in the mire of
all sensual pleasures, when they should have dipped us in the sacred Laver of
regeneration; they kept us from God our Father, and the Church our Mother.

But I will not longer insist upon this observation, because (as I conceive)
the Spirit uses this speech not so much to set an edge upon our religious care
and diligence, as give a back to our patience; only I propose Monica the
mother of S. Austin as a pattern to all parents: Aug. confess. l. 1. c. 11. Illa
magis satagebat ut tu mihi pater esses quam ille, and conturbata erat propter
baptismi dilationem, quoniam sempiternam salutem meam charius parturiebat.
She endured, says he, greater sorrow, and was longer in travel for my
second birth than my first, and much more rejoiced at it; she continued her
fervent prayers day and night, with sighs of grief and tears of love, for my
conversion. Sometimes she sought to win me by sweet allurements, sometimes
by sharp threats, sometimes by force of argument, sometimes by vehemence of
passion; she dealt with many learned Bishops to confer with me, to convince
me of my errors, whereof one sent her away with this comfort; Confess. l. 2. c.
12.
Fieri non potest ut filius tantarum lachrymarum pereat; It is not possible
that a child should miscarry, for whom the mother has taken so much thought,
and shed so many tears. This care of planting religion in the hearts of
children, as ground new broken up, and watering the roots of grace in them by
frequent admonitons and instructions, is assigned for the chief cause of those
extraordinary blessings which God bestowed upon Abraham: for so we read, Genesis
18.17.
Shall I hide from Abraham the things that I do, seeing he shall be a mighty
nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? for I know
him, that he will command his sons, and his household after him, that they
shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord
may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him.

Now because such is the wantonness and stubbornness of most children, that
they cannot be taught any thing without fear of the rod, the word (...) is in
some sort appropriated to gentle corrections, such as are used by Masters and
Fathers in the nurturing and teaching their scholars and children. Wherein God
takes a clean contrary course to the custom of most earthly parents: for
they commonly beat those children whom they affect not, and lay stripes upon
them often without cause or mercy; but they are most indulgent unto, cocker up,
and never leave embracing and kissing their darlings: God contrariwise
scourges that child most, whom he most delights in. Why? takes he any
pleasure to see his dearest childrens eyes swollen with weeping, their cheeks
blubbered with tears, their flesh torn with rods? Surely no: for they that
are in such a plight, are rather ruefull spectacles of misery, than amiable
objects of love: how then does he that in love, which he loves not to do? Is
not that elegant speech of Saint Austine a riddle, Castigat quos amat, non
tamen amat Castigare; He chasteneth whom he loves, yet he loves not to
chasten? None at all: for a Surgeon launceth the flesh of his dearest friend or
brother in love, yet he takes no pleasure in launcing, nor would do it at
all, but to prevent the festring of the sore.

The best answer to the former objection will be, to assign the reasons why
God in justice and in love cannot oftentimes withhold his rod from his dearest
children. To speak nothing of the relics of original sin in us after
Baptism, which like cindars are still apt to set on fire Gods wrath, and like
an aguish matter left after a fit, still cause new paroxysmes of Gods
judgments: ease it self and rest casts us into a dead sleep of security,
which we are never thoroughly awaked of, till God smite us on the side, as the
Acts 12.7.
Angel did Peter. Prosperity, and a sequence of temporal blessings, like
fatness in the soil, breed in the mind a kind of rankness, which the
sorrows of afflictions eat out. Moreover, worldly pleasures distemper the
taste of the soul, so that it cannot relish wholesome food; which evil is
cured by drinking deep in the cup of tears. Neither seems it to stand with
the justice of God, that they who are to triumph in heaven, should perform no
worthy service in his battles upon the earth. It is too great ambition for any
Christian to desire two heavens; and to attain greater happiness than our
Lord and King, who took his cross in his way to his Kingdom, and was crowned
with thorns before he was crowned with glory. Lact. div. instit.
Lactantius rightly observes, Bonis brevibus mala aeterna, and malis brevibus
bona aeterna succedunt: that we are put to our choice, either to pass from
momentary pleasures to everlasting pains, or to pass from momentary pains to
everlasting pleasures; either to forgo transitory delights for eternal joys,
or to buy the pleasures of sin for a season at the dear rate of everlasting
torments. Were there no necessity of justice, that they who are to receive a
superexcellent weight of glory, should bear heavy crosses in this life; nor
congruity of reason, that they who are to be satisfied with celestial
dainties, should fast here, and taste of bitter sorrows, that they might
better relish their future banquet: yet it were an indecorum at least, that
the Captain should bear all the brunt, and endure all the hardness, and the
common soldier endure nothing; that the head should be crowned with thorns,
and the members softly arrayed; that the head should be spit upon, and the
members have sweet ointments poured on them. Wherefore Saint Paul teaches us,
that all whom God fore-knew, he predestined to be made conformable to the
Romans 8.29.

wounds, that the Prophet says, he had no Esa. 53.2.
form in him. What himself spoke of the children of Zebedee, appertains to
us all, Ye shall Mat. 20.22.
drink of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized
withal. By baptism he means not to be dipped only in the waters of Marah,
but to be plunged in them over head and ears, as the ancient manner of
baptism was. He who was nailed to the Cross for us, will have us take up our
Mat. 10.38.
cross and follow him. He that endured so much to show his love to us, will
have us in some sort to answer him in love: which as it is a passion, so it is
tried rather by passions than by actions; in which respect we must not only
do, but suffer for his sake, that our love may be complete both in parts and
degrees. To you it is Phil. 1.29.
given, says Saint Paul, not only to believe in him, but to suffer for his
sake. For he 1 Pet. 2.21.
suffered for us, giving us an example. Should he have suffered all for us, and
as he took away all sin, so all suffering from us, carrying away all crosses
and tribulations with him; patience should not have had her work among other
divine virtues and graces, and thereby our crown of glory should have wanted
one most fair and rich jewel. Wherefore God, who is all goodness, desirous
to make us partakers of all the goodness which our nature is capable of, by
the misery of his distressed members gives matter for our charity and
compassion, by our continual temptations matter for faith, by conflicts with
heretics and persecuters matter for constancy, by the dangers of this life
matter for wisdom, by our manifold infirmities and frailties matter for
humility, by chastenings and afflictions matter for patience to work upon.

Whether for these, or any better reasons, best known to himself, it is that
our heavenly Father holds a heavy hand sometimes over his dearest children,
certain it is, that few or none of them escape his stroke: he chasteneth as
many as he loves; or, as we read Hebr. 12.6. he scourges every son whom
he receives: therefore all that 2 Timothy 3.12.
will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer affliction. Afflictions are in our
way to heaven: for we must through many Acts 14.22.
afflictions enter into the Kingdom of God. Before we sing the song of Moses
and the servants of God, we are to swim through a sea of burning glass: the
sea is this present life, swelling with pride, wan with envy, boiling with
wrath, deep with fraud and malice, foming with luxuriousness, ebbing and
flowing with inconstancy; which is here said to be of Apoc. 15.2. I saw as it
were a sea of glass mingled with fire.
glass, to signify the brittle nature thereof; and burning, to represent the
furnace of adversity, wherein the godly are still tried and purified in this
world. And that we may not think, that God his rod is for those only who are
habes in Christ Jesus, let us set before us David and Jeremy: the former a man
after Gods own heart; the latter a Prophet sanctified from his mothers womb:
the former laid his heart a soaking in the brine of afflictions: Every Psalm.
6.6.

The other cries out in the bitterness of his soul, I am the man that have

affliction in the rod of his indignation. He has bent his bow, and made me
a mark for his arrows, and has filled me with bitterness, and made me
drunk with wormwood. Verily Job sipped not of the cup of trembling, but took
such a deep draught, that it bereft him in a manner of all sense, and put him
so far besides himself, that he curses the very day of his birth, and would
have it razed out of the calendar: Job 3 4, 5, 6, 7.
Let that day be darkened, let the shadow of death obscure it, let it not be
joined to the days of the year, nor let it come within the count of the
months: why dyed I not in my birth? why dyed I not when I came out of the
womb? Ye hear the loud cries of Gods children, whereby ye perceive they
feel oftentimes the smart of their Fathers rod, and are sore beat by him.

Applicat. Deus unum habuit filium sine flagitio, nullum sine flagello.
1. Is it so? does God chasten every son whom he receives? nay in whom he
delights, not sparing his only beloved son, with whom he was ever well
pleased? why then should we look to be privileged and exempted from the
orders of Christ's school? How nice and tenderly have we been brought up, that
we cannot endure the sight of our heavenly Fathers rod? We stick to sip of
that cup which was David's diet-drinke; and Jeremy and Job took it all off: are
we better than these holy men? nay are we too good to pledge our Savior in the
cup of his passion? Do we breathe out some sighs in our crosses? he sighed
out his last breath in torments upon the cross: Nos suspiramus in cruciatibus,
ille expiravit in cruce. Do our troubles and vexations draw some watery tears
from our eyes? his drew from him tears of blood, yea clotted blood from all
parts of his body. Does the burden of our sins press our souls? the
burden of the sins of the whole world lay upon him. Are we pricked with
cares? he was crowned with thorns. Are we cruciated? he was crucified. Tacitus
reports, that though the amber ring among the Romans were before of no value,
yet after the Emperor began to wear it, it became to be in great esteem: so
(me thinks) since our Lord and Savior both bore his cross, and was borne
upon it, we should make better reckoning of crosses; and it should be counted
an honor for every Christian to take up his cross and follow him.

2. Again, does God chasten as many as he loves; and consequently, loves
them not at all whom he never chasteneth? how far then are most of us besides
the matter in our judgment, and opinion of these things? If we see a man
flourish in prosperity, we commonly say such a man is beloved of God; for he
thriveth in the world, and all things prosper with him: but if on the sudden
all the fruits of his labors are blasted with some sharp wind of adversity, if
we see him never without some grief or other, some cross or other, we alter
our opinion, and suppose him to be some wretch, whom God plagueth for his
sins. If the Viper be upon Paul's hand, he is presently a Act. 28.4.
murderer, whom vengeance would not suffer to live: whereas the verdict and
sentence of the Holy Ghost, whereto our judgments should absolutely submit, is
far otherwise. Lo, these are the wicked, who have their Psalm. 17.14.
portion in this life, the rod of God is not upon them: they grow in wealth,
and their seed is established in their sight. They come in no Psalm. 73.5, 6, 7.
trouble like other folk, neither are they plagued like other men. Their eyes
stand out with fatness, and they have more than heart can wish. Thou have
planted Jerem. 12.2.
them, and they have taken root, and bring forth fruit.

I speak not this to detract from the bounty of our gracious God, who has the
blessings of this life and the life to come in store for his children, and he
bestows them upon them, when he sees it good for them; but to lessen
somewhat our great opinion of them, and put us in a better conceit of
afflictions, which are surer arguments of Gods love than the other. Had the
Apostle said, We must through many pleasures enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,
it is to be thought Heaven would have been full by this time: but he says not
so, but the direct contrary; We must through many Acts 14.22.
afflictions enter into it. Wherefore, as passengers that have been told that
their way lies over a steep hill, or down a craggy rock, or through a morish
fen, or dirty vale, if they suddenly fall into some pleasant meddow enameled
with beautiful flowers, or a goodly corn field, or a fair champian country,
look about them, and, bethinking themselves where they are, say, Surely we are
out of the way, we see no hills, nor rocks, nor fens, nor deep clay: this is
too good to be the right way. So in the course of our life, which is a
pilgrimage upon earth, when we pass through fields of corn, or gardens of
flowers, and enjoy all worldly pleasures and contentments, let us cast with our
selves: Surely this is not the way the Scripture directs us unto, here are
not the tribulations we are to pass through, we see no footsteps of Gods
Saints here, but only the print of Dives feet; somewhere we have mist our way,
let us search and find out where and when we turned out of it. This anxiety of
mind, this careful circumspection, this questioning our selves, and suspecting
our own ways, will bring us into the right way: for by thus afflicting our
selves in prosperity, we shall make it the way to Heaven. As the Passover was
to be eaten with sour herbs, so let us sauce all our worldly comforts with
these sharp and sour meditations, that we surfeit not of them.

We find no grievous crime laid to Dives his charge, only this is father
Abraham's memento to him: Son, remember thou receivedst thy pleasure in this
life. Continual Lact. divin. instit. l. 6. c. 21. Cavenda sunt oblectamenta
ista tanquam laquei and plagae, ne suavitudinum mollitie capti, sub ditionem
mortis cum ipso corpore redigamur cui mancipamur.
prosperity and worldly pleasures are like luscious fruit, more sweet than
wholesome: they distemper the spiritual taste, they breed noxious humors in
the body, and dangerous maladies in the soul. And if they end not in sorrow,
we are the more to sorrow for them, according to that sweet speech of Saint
Aug. confess. l. 10. c. 1. Caetera vitae hujus tanto minus flenda, quanto magis
fletur in iis, etc.
Austine: The joys and delights, or rather the toys and vanities of this
life, are by so much the less to be bewailed, by how much more we bewail; and
by so much the more to be bewailed, by how much the less we bewail them, and
for them. On the contrary, afflictions are usually tokens of Gods love, badges
of his servants, arguments of his care, remedies against most dangerous evils,
and occasions of excellent virtues: and as the other have a sweet taste at the
first, but are bitter afterward; so these are bitter at the first, but sweet
at the last. For in the end they bring the quiet fruit of Heb. 12.11.
righteousness to them thot are exercised thereby. John 16.20.
Ye shall mourn, says Christ to his Disciples, but the world shall rejoice;
but be of good comfort, your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

What then? are we professedly to pray for afflictions? No, God requires no
such thing; but only that we patiently endure them. May we not enjoy the
blessings of this life? We may, but not over-joy in them. What Christ speaks
of riches, may be said of the rest: If honors, if promotions, if all sorts of
worldly comforts abound to us, let us not set our hearts on them: let us
neither accept the greatest preferments with his curse, nor repine at the
greatest afflictions with his love. As Fabritius told Pyrrhus, who one day
tempted him with gold, and the next day sought to terrefie him with an
Elephant, which before he had never seen; Yesterday I was no whit moved with
your gold, nor to day with your beast: So let neither abundance transport us,
nor wants dismay us: neither prosperity exalt us, nor adversity deject us; but
both incite us to bless God: In prosperity to praise his bounty, and in
adversity his justice; and in both, his provident care over us. And the Lord of
his infinite mercy inform us by his Word of the true estimate of the things of
this life, that we neither overvalue earthly blessings, nor under-value
crosses and afflictions: that we be neither lifted up with the one, nor
depressed with the other; but always even balanced with his love. And because
the bitter cup of trembling cannot pass, but first or last we must all drink
it, let us beseech him to sweeten it unto us, and strengthen us with cordialls
of comfort, that we faint not under his rod, but endure with patience what he
inflicteth in love, and overcome with courage what he suffered for love, that
following his obedience, and bearing his cross, we may enter his Kingdom, and
wear his Crown. Cui, etc.

THE LOT OF THE GODLY. THE XLVIII. SERMON.
APOC. 3.19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.


Right Honorable, etc.
I Have discovered unto you in the opening of this Text four springs of the
rivers of Paradise, for the comfort and refreshing of all that are heavy
laden, and wearied in their travel to the celestial Canaan, and often
scorched with the heat of heart-burning sorrows and grief: The first arising
from the author of afflictions. The second from the nature of afflictions. The
third from the subject of afflictions. The fourth from the end of afflictions.


1. God sends afflictions, I. 2. Afflictions are chastenings, chasten. 3.
Chastenings are the lot of all his children, as many. 4. All his children thus
chastened are beloved, as I love.
1. God has a hand in the scourging his children, I. Let us therefore 1.
Submit under his mighty hand in patience. 2. Lay our hand on our mouth in
silence. 3. Lift up our hands to him, and in prayer turn to him that smites
us.


2. All our sufferings are chastenings of our heavenly Father for our
amendment. Let us therefore 1. Be instructed by them. 2. Take comfort in them.
3. Be thankful for them.


3. Chastenings are the lot of all Gods children: therefore let 1. None repine
at them, 2. All look and prepare for them.


4. God strikes his children not in anger, but in love: therefore let us 1.
Seek to be of the number of his children, 2. Embrace his love, 3. In like
manner chasten those whom we love.


The water of the two former springs we have tasted heretofore; let us now draw
out of the third, which is so great and spacious that all Gods children may
bathe in it together.

As many. God scourges every son whom he receives, not exempting his best
beloved and only begotten Son. For the Esaias 53.5.
chastisement of our peace was laid upon him; he was chastened for our sins,
but we for our amendment. In every part of Gods floor there is some chafe,
affliction is the fan to cleanse it: in all the gold of the Sanctuary there
is some dross, affliction is the fire that purges it: in all the branches of
the true Vine there are some superfluous stems, affliction is the pruning knife
to cut them off: in all the members of the mystical body there are some
peccant humors, affliction is the pill to purge them. We are all too greedy of
the sweet milk of worldly pleasures, therefore God weaneth us from them by
anointing the teat with wormwood. When the Angel in the Apoc. 14.17.
Apocalypse had recorded all the troubles, and calamities, and miseries that
should fall in the last times, he closes up all with this epiphonema, Here is
the patience of the Saints: as if the Saints were to bear them all, who
certainly bear the greater part. For besides common evils, in which most men
(if not all) have their part, though usually Benjamins portion is the greatest,
I mean, loss of goods, decease of friends, captivity, banishment,
imprisonment, sickness, and death; there are many heavy crosses laid upon the
Saints of God, which the children of the world never see, and much less feel
the weight of them. Many have written learnedly of the diverse sorts and forms
of material crosses, wherewith the bodies of Gods children have been tortured
by persecuting Tyrants; but none yet has, or (as I am persuaded) can describe
the spiritual crosses, wherewith many of them have been, and are daily
martyred in mind. I will set five before you, and let every one add his own
particular cross unto them: they are 1. Derision. 2. Indignation. 3.
Compassion. 4. Spiritual desertions. 5. Godly sorrow.


1. Derision: for as Ismael derided Isaac, and as Michol scoffed at David, so
they that are Gal. 4.29.
borne of the flesh, mock at them that are borne of the spirit; and this
scorn and derision so grievously afflicted many of Gods children, that it is
called in Scripture Heb. 11.36.
persecution, and a great trial. Others had trial of cruel mockings; and as
he that was borne of the flesh persecuted him that was borne of the spirit, so
it is now.

2. Indignation at the prosperity of the wicked, which was a great eyesore, as
we heard before, to Job 21.7, 8, 9.10.11, 12, 13.
Job, Psalm. 73.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.
David, and Jer. 12.2.
Jeremy.

3 Compassion for the miseries of Gods chosen, 2 Cor. 11.28, 29.

4 The state of spiritual desertion, when God seems for a time to withdraw
the comforts of the Spirit from them, Psalm. 22.1, 2.

5 Godly sorrow, when they are cast down to the ground with the weight of
their sin, and have a quick sense and feeling of the displeasure of their
heavenly Father. The three former scourges draw many tears from their eyes;
but the two latter lifeblood from their hearts: and if God stayed not his
hand, and in the depth of their sorrows refreshed them with comforts, they
could not but be swallowed up in the gulf of despair. For the more a man
fears God, and is sensible of his love, the more tender he is to bear his
wrath; and the tenderer he is, the arrows of God pierce deeper, and stick
faster in the soul, which none can pluck out but he that shot them. Ovid. de
trist. l 1.
-- Qui vulnera fecit
Solus Achilleo tollere more potest.
The reprobate, as Calvin rightly observes, though God lay often upon them
many heavy strokes, yet because they weigh not the cause, nor are pricked in
heart for their sins, by their carelessness gather hardness; and because
they murmr and kick against God, and make an uproare against his
proceedings, their rage transporteth them into madness, and their madness
breeds in them an insensible stupidity: but the faithful being admonished by
God his correction, presently descend into the consideration of their own
sins, and being stricken with grief and horror, fly to him by humble
prayer for pardon; and unless God in mercy should assuage these sorrows,
wherewith their souls are heavy unto death, they would buckle under so great
a burden, and languish in despair. The manner of the Plin. not. hist. l. 28.
Psylli si arbitrantur supposititium esse aliquem in stirpe, admovent ei ut
pungant colubra; si non sit de gente, mori cum pupugerint; si de gente sit,
vivere.
Psilli (which are a kind of people of that temper and constitution that no
venom will hurt them) is, that if they suspect any child to be none of their
own, they set an adder upon it to sting it; and if it cry and the flesh swell,
they cast it away for spurious: but if it never quatch nor be the worse after
it, they account it their own, and make very much of it. In like manner
Almighty God tyres his children by enduring crosses and afflictions: he
suffers the old Serpent to sting them, and bring troubles and sorrows upon
them; and if they patiently endure them and make good use of them, he offers
himself unto them as to children, and will make them heirs of his kingdom:
but if they roar, and cry, and storm, and fret, and can no ways abide the
pain, he accounts them for Heb. 12.8.
bastards and no children. God commanded the Altar, and Table, and
Candlestickes, and vessels, and instruments in the Sanctuary to be made of
pure and beaten gold: and accordingly all they that hope or desire to be made
vessels of honor and golden instruments of Gods glory, must make account to
be tried in Gods furnace, and beat with his hammer. We may not look to find
God in the pleasant gardens of Egypt, whom Moses found in the thorny bush. The
Spouse in the Canticles met not with him whom her soul loved in the day of
prosperity, but in the night of adversity.

None ought to be extraordinarily affected in ordinary accidents, nor
impropriate to himself the common afflictions of all Gods children. The Poet
said truly, Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris. Therefore Socrates
professed that he was the more willing to drink off his fatal potion
prepared by the State, because after his death he should meet with Palamedes,
whose lot it was to be unjustly condemned, as he was. If there be any virtue
in this drugge, any comfort in the society of sufferers, if grief be
diminished by dividing it among many, we have as many partners in our
afflictions as God has children in the world: we bear not alone Christ's
whole cross, as Simon Cyreneus once did; all the Saints of God bear a part
with us. May we not in this respect take great comfort in affliction, that by
them we are made free of Christ's school, and partakers of the nurture and
discipline of all Gods children, and in it every day more and more conformed to
the image of our Savior? which the more it was defaced, the more fair and
beautiful it makes us; the more pitiful it was to behold, the more powerful
to move compassion, and purchase to us freedom from all misery and woe. The
stretching of his joints added to our stature, and the blackness and wanness
of his stripes proved the beauty of our souls: the wider his wounds were
torn, the more anguish ran out of our sores; the more blood he shed out of
his heart, the more he powered into our veins, and the abundance of his tears
was the overflowing of our waters of comfort. Therefore the Spouse of Christ
contemplating the image of her husband, by so much the more amiable, by how
much the more disfigured for her sake, blusheth not to proclaim her self
black; Cant. 1.5. Bernard. in Cant. Non erubescit nigredinem quam scit
prcaeessisse in sponso, nihil gloriosius putat, quam Christi portare opprobrium.
I am black, O ye daughters of Jerusalem. Because it was the color of her
husband, she takes a glory in bearing his shame; a holy pride in resembling
the colors of his stripes: Nigredo est, sed sponsi similitudo est; seem it a
deformity, yet it is a conformity to her husband Christ Jesus.

Yea, but Cardinal Bell. l. 4. de not. eccles. c. 18.
Bellarmine labors to wrest out of our hands the strong weapons we find in
my text against impatiency, and repining at afflictions: for he makes
temporal felicity an inseparable note of true believers, and consequently
temporal infelicity, and outward calamities the marks of heretics and
reprobates, living and dying without the Church, as being aliens from the
Commonwealth of Israel. If this were so, all the balm of Gilead would not cure
the wounds and sores of Christ's afflicted members: if to losses, disgraces,
banishment, imprisonment, and all outward evils which they often endure, you
add the note of a reprobate, and a fearful expectation of everlasting pains
to succeed these which put their patience daily to the test; how can they but
condemn their eyes to everlasting tears, who have no hope of a better life
hereafter, and are here made a spectacle to the world, and Angels, and men, who
are killed all the day long, and therefore dye daily?

But be of good comfort all ye who sigh and groan under the burden of your
afflictions, or weight of your crosses: he who excludes you out of the true
Church by reason of your manifold afflictions in this life, excludes with you
the holy Prophets and men of God, before Christ's coming, and since; Heb.
11.36, 37, 38.
Who were tried with mockings, and scourgings; yea moreover with bonds and
imprisonment, were stoned, were hewn asunder, were slain with the sword,
wandered up and down in sheep skins, and goats skins, destitute,
afflicted, and tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. He excludes the
glorious company of the Apostles, and noble army of Martyrs, and Christ
himself from the true Church. All the Jesuiticall sleights which this cunning
Sophister uses, cannot avoid the evident absurdity lighting upon his erroneous
assertion, unless he can impeach the sacred records; where we find the
Church butchered in Abel, floating in the Arc, going on pilgrimage in the
days of the Patriarchs, taken captive in Egypt, after wandering in the
wilderness, flying to save her life, and hiding her self in the time of
idolatrous Kings: and after Christ's coming into the flesh cruelly persecuted,
first by Heathen, after by Arrian and heretical Emperors, and last of all by
Antichrist and his adherents. Ye see by this Epitomy of her story the reason
of her complaints, Cant. 1.6.
Regard me not because I am black, for the sun has looked upon me, the
sons of my mother were angry against me. Cant. 5.7.
The watchmen that went about the City found me, they smote me, and wounded
me, and took away my veil from me. Stay me with flaggons, and comfort me
with apples, for I am sick for love. Hereby also you may give a fit motto to
those emblemes in holy Scripture, A lilly among thorns, A dove whose note is
mourning, A vine spoiled by little foxes, and partly rooted out by the wild
bore of the forest, A woman great with child, and a fiery dragon pursuing
her. According to which patterns Saint Jerome frames his, Rubus ardens est
figura ecclesiae, quae flammis persecutionum non consumitur, sed viret magis.
Hier. in verb. Exodus 3.2.
A bush burning, yet not consuming; and as fitly Saint Gregory draws her with
Christ's cross in her hand, with her challenge there unto, Ecclesia haeres
crucis, The Church is an inheretrix of the cross. And it appears by all
records hitherto that she has possessed it; and if we examine the matter
well, we shall find that Christ had nothing else to leave her at his death.
For goods and lands upon earth he never had; Mat. 8.20.
The foxes, says he, have holes, and the birds nests, but the son of man
has not where to lay his head. His soul he bequeathed to his father, his
body was begged by Joseph of Arimathea, his garments the soldiers took for
their fee, and cast lots upon his vestments: only the cross, together with
the nails, and gall and vinegar bestowed upon him at his death, he left her
as a Heriot. For these, withal the appurtenances, scourges, cries, sighs,
groans, stripes, and wounds, he bequeathed to her by his life time, in those
words, Joh. 16.33. Mat. 10.17, 18. and 24.9, 10, 11. Joh. 16.10.
In the world ye shall have troubles, they shall persecute you in their
Synagogues, and scourge you, and ye shall be hated of all men for my names
sake; insomuch that they that kill you, shall think they do God good service.
Ye shall weep and mourn, but the world shall rejoice. Upon which words Lib.
de spectac. c. 28. Vicibus res disposita est, lugeamus ergo dum ethnici
gaude^t, ut cum lugere coeperint gaudeamus, ne pariter nunc gaudentes, cum
quoque pariter lugeamus: delicatus es, Christian, si and in seculo voluptatem
concupiscis; imo ni^i^is stultus si hoc existimas voluptatem.
Tertullian infers, God has disposed of joys and sorrows by turns; let
us mourn when worldlings rejoice, that when they mourn we may rejoice. Thou
art too dainty and choice, O Christian, if besides the joys of heaven laid up
for thee, thou look for a liberal portion of delights and pleasures in this
world; nay thou art too foolish if thou countest there is any true pleasure in
such things wherein they place their happiness. I need not press many texts
of Scripture which yield this sharp juice: as, Psalm. 34.19.
Many are the troubles of the righteous: 2 Timothy 3.12.
All that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution: 1 Pet. 4.17.
Judgment begins at the house of God; this verse alone which I now handle is
sufficient to clear Christ's afflicted members from all note of heresy, and
imputation of reprobates. For if afflictions are chastisements of Gods
children, and tokens of his love (I rebuke and chasten as many as I love) then
are they not necessarily judgments for sin, messengers of wrath, much less
proper marks of heretics and reprobates. The kingdom of heaven is not
necessarily annexed to earthly crowns, nor is eternal glory any way an
appendant to worldly pomp. To conclude, affluence of temporal blessings is no
note of the true, because store of afflictions is no note of the false Church.
Which truth is so apparent, that many Papists of note have expressly delivered
it in their annotations upon holy Scripture; as Stap. in verb Joh. In mundo
pressuras habebitis.
Stapleton, the Rhemists, and Mald. in Mat. 5. Facit solemn orire sup^r bonos
and malos: unde perspicuum est hominum aut nationum prosperos successus, nullum
signum aut testimonium esse verioris aut purioris religionis.
Maldonate: God causes his Sun to rise upon the just and upon the unjust;
whence (says the Jesuit) it is evident that the prosperity of men or nations
is no certain sign or argument of the truth or purity of religion which they
profess. Howbeit as Praxiteles drew Venus after the picture of Cratina his
Mistress, and all the Painters of Thebes after the similitude of Phryne a
beautiful strumpet: so Bellarmine being to paint and limme Christ's Spouse,
took his notes from his own Mistress, the Roman Phryne, the whore of Babylon,
and mother of fornications. Look upon the picture of that strumpet drawn to
the life by Saint John (Apoc. 17.) and let your eyes be Judges. I saw (says
he) a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast (verse. 3.) full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns (verse. 4.) And the woman was
arrayed in purple, and scarlet color, and decked with gold, and precious
stones, and pearls, (what is this but Bellarmine his note of temporal
felicity?) having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations; of which it
seems the Cardinal drank deep, when he took the pencill in his hand to
pourtray the true Church, else he could not be so out in his draught, nor so
utterly forget not only what others, but himself also had formerly set down
in this point. For in his solution of an objection of Martin Luther, who stood
in the opposite extreme, affirming afflictions to be an inseparable note of
the Church, he confesses freely that the Church in the beginning and in the
end was in great straights: and for this purpose, to show that persecutions
though they eclipse the glory of the Church, yet can never utterly extinguish
it, he alleges such remarkable passages out of the ancient Fathers as these:
Justin. Mart. in apolog.
Persecution is but the pruning of Christ's vine: and, Tertul. in Apologet.
the blood of Martyrs is as seed: and, Leo Ser. 1. de Pet. and Paul.
the grains that fall one by one and dye in the earth, rise up again in great
numbers. If the Church run into superfluous stemmes without the pruning knife
of afflictions: if the blood of martyrs turns into seed to generate new
Martyrs: if the Church in her nonage had many sore conflicts, and shall have
greater in her old age; certainly abundance, ease, pleasure, and glory, which
make up temporal felicity, are no notes of her: for L. 1. de notis eccles. c.
2.
Notae debem esse inseparabiles, the notes of any thing cannot be severed from
it, as himself affirms. By this I hope ye all perceive a great difference
between the true lineaments of Christ his Spouse, and Bellarmine his
counterfeit draught; between the Queen of Solomon all glorious within, and
the whore of Babylon all pompous without; between the manicles and fetters of
the one, and the bracelets and chains of the other; between the cup of
affliction in her hand, and the cup of abominations in the hand of this; and
ye are persuaded that of all outward marks, next to her speech, the language
of Canaan, and her diet the blessed Sacrament, the surest are some scars and
cuts, together with the print of stripes upon her otherwise most fair and
unspotted body.

Yet because the law condemns no man before he has been heard, though
perhaps he has nothing, or as good as nothing to say for himself, I will
propose unto you his allegations, which are principally the examples of
Abraham, Moses, David, Ezekiah, and Josias; and by these he will be tried,
whether temporal happiness be not a note of true professors. To which
instances I answer in general, that if these men had been chosen out of God,
upon whom he will show the riches of his goodness in the blessings of this
life, yet their special privileges were not to come into the account of
common favors, nor their particular examples to make general rules. The
inward estate and life of the Church more depends upon the outward happiness
of Princes, than the fortunes of private men; neither can we judge of a Play
by one Scene, nor of the happiness of a man's life by one act, or more, but the
whole current thereof. But what if these Worthies of the world, whom he
singleth out for paragons of happiness, had no temporal felicity at all? or
none in comparison with their troubles and adversity? or at least in
comparison with the prosperity of the heathen Emperors, and persecuting
Tyrants, whose dominions were far larger, estate securer, victories
incomparably greater? Vouchsafe you a look to his particulars.

First, he brings in Abraham as an example of the temporal felicity of true
professors, whom the Scripture rather proposes as a pattern of patience, and
a spectacle of manifold adversity: a pilgrim wandering from his own country,
afflicted with famine in Egypt, forced to forgo his wife, and deny her to save
his life, without any issue by her till his old age, and when God gave him a
son commanded to slay him with his own hands. Yet may it be pleaded for
Bellarmine that Abraham got a notable victory, and wan the field of Kedarlaomer
and other Kings, and rescued his brother Lot. Admit this, but withal let it
be noted that in the self same story Lot was taken prisoner by Kedarlaomer,
and consequently that victory in war is no certain argument of the truth of
religion. Howsoever, will they conclude it to be summer by the flight of one
swallow? or account it a fair day wherein the sun once shows himself?

I need not speak of Moses, in whom he secondly instanceth, the Scripture is
plain, Heb. 11.25.
That he chose rather to suffer affliction with the children of God, than to
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Who can be ignorant, except
peradventure some Lay Papist prohibited to read the sacred Scriptures, how
Moses was exposed by his parents, put in an Ark of bulrushes into the river,
saved from drowning by Pharaohs daughter? how he fled to save his life, and
kept close forty years in the land of Madian? And after he had led the children
of Israel through infinite difficulties and dangers, notwithout many murmurings
and conspiracies against his person, when he came to the very borders of
Canaan was forbid to enter in, and commanded by God himself to dye upon Mount
Nebo. What shall I speak of David and the rest? did not foreign wars, and
homebred seditions, the conspiracy of his own son Absalom against him,
together with infinite other troubles, griefs and cares, constrain him
oftentimes to mingle his drink with his tears, and the songs of Sion with his
sighs? Was he a mirror of temporal happiness, who complains in the
bitterness of his soul; I am weary of my groaning, every night wash I my bed
and water my couch with my tears: my beauty is gone for very trouble, and
worn away because of all my enemies. I am a worm and no man, the very scorn
of men, and outcast of the people. One depth of sorrow calls upon another,
all thy waves and storms have gone over me? As for Hezekiah, it cannot be
denied that God richly rewarded his zeal, and crowned the calendar of his life
with many festivals; yet Saint Bernards observation was verified in him, that
no man ever had such a prosperous course, but that he received a rub before his
death: Fieri non potest ut in hoc seculo quisquam non gustet angustias. For in
his time Sennacharib besieged Jerusalem, and put the good King in fear of his
crown and life: and after his miraculous delivery from that danger, he fell
into a worse. For he was smitten with a dangerous disease, thought to be the
plague: Esaias 38.1.
the Text says, he was sick unto death; and in the bitterness of his pain,
and fear of present death, he cries out, Ver. 17.
Behold, for felicity I had bitter grief and misery. But most of all is the
Cardinal out in his last instance of Josiah, of whom after the commendation of
his zeal in reformation of Religion, and taking away all abominations out of
Israel and Judah, we read little, but that fighting with Pharaoh Neco he was
slain at Megiddo, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him, and the Prophet
Jeremy, and all singing men and singing women bewailed his death in their
lamentations to this day.

Ye see how unhappy this great Advocate of Rome is in his instances of
temporal happiness; yet had they been all happy whom he names, and drunk
their fill of the rivers of pleasure, and never tasted the waters of Marah,
what are they to that great Apoc. 7.9.
multitude which no man can number, of all nations, and kinreds, and people,
that stood before the Throne and the Lamb, arrayed with long white robes,
having palms in their hands? concerning whom when one of the Elders asked,
what are these, and whence came they? and Saint John answered, Lord, thou
know: the Elder replyeth, saying: These are they that came out of great
tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of
the Lamb: therefore are they in the presence of the Throne of God, and serve
him day and night in his Temple, and he that fitteth on the Throne will dwell
among them.

I will conclude this point with that grave determination of S. Lib. 1. de
civit. Dei, c. 8. Placuit divinae providentiae praeparare inposterum bona
justis, quibus non fruerentur injusti; and mal^ ^mpiis, quibus non cruciabuntur
justi: ista vero temporalia bona and mala utrisque voluit esse communia, ut nec
bona c^^^^ius appetantur, quae mali quoque habere cernuntur; nec mala turpius
evitentur, quibus and boni plerunque af^iciuntur.
Austine: It pleased divine providence to prepare hereafter good things for the
righteous, wherein the wicked shall not partake with them; and evils for the
wicked, wherewith the righteous shall never be troubled: but as for these
temporal good things and evil, he would have them in some sort common to
both; that neither the blessings of this life should be too greedily desired,
in which wicked men have a share, neither crosses and afflictions too fearfully
avoided, which we see fall often to the lot of the righteous. In sum, neither
prosperity, nor adversity, nor affluence of earthly blessings, nor afflictions,
are infallible demonstrations of Gods love, nor certain and inseparable notes
of Christ's Church. Afflictions may be (though usually they are not in them that
fear God) judgments of wrath; and temporal blessings may be (though usually
in most men they are not) tokens of Gods love. Therefore let us not set our
heart and affections upon worldly goods, because they are often the portions of
the wicked; neither yet let us set our hearts wholly against them, because they
may fall to the lot of the righteous, and do, when they may further and not
hinder their eternal salvation. Let us not desire the greatest preferments of
this world with Gods hatred, nor refuse the greatest crosses with his love. Let
us not repine at the temporal felicity of the wicked, which ends in eternal
misery; nor be dismayed at the temporal infelicity of the godly, because it
ends in everlasting felicity. Let prosperity commend our charity and
temperance, and adversity our courage and patience. Let us do for Christ in
the one, and suffer for him in the other, and in both estates admire his
provident justice, and for both sanctified unto us, praise his gracious
goodness. Cui, etc.

THE OIL OF THYME. THE XLIX. SERMON.
REV. 3.19. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten.


Right Honorable, etc.
PLutarch in his Treatise of the Plut. de anim. tranquil. (...), etc.
tranquillity of the mind, writes, that though Thyme be a most dry and bitter
herb, yet that not only the Apothecaries draw an wholesome oil out of it; but
also that the Bees extract from thence sweet honey. This dry and bitter herb is
affliction to the taste of most men; yet out of it we have drawn both a
wholesome oil to cure a wounded conscience, and honey also to delight the
spiritual taste. Oil out of the nature of afflictions, which are chastenings,
and honey out of the cause, Gods love: As many as I love I rebuke and chasten.
In this Text the parts answer the number of the words, the arguments the parts,
the comforts the arguments, as I have declared heretofore; yet they all (with
much ado) draw our assent to this conclusion, That we are not to rise up at,
nor to faint under Gods correcting hand. For the doctrine of enduring
affliction is durus sermo, quis potest far? a hard speech, who can endure it?
Albeit we know that God has the chief stroke therein, and all his dearest
children have part with us, yet we grudge at them: though we are taught even by
God himself, that they are effects of his love, and causes of our good, yet we
are dismayed at them. So bladder-like is the soul of man, that being filled
with earthly vanities, though but wind, it grows great, and swells in
pride; but if it be pricked with the least pin or smallest needle of piercing
grief, it presently shriveleth to nothing. Afflictions are pillulae lucis
(pills made on purpose to clear the eyesight) prescribed by a most tender and
skillful Physician, gilt over with the names of chastenings and fatherly
corrections, and sugered with the love of God, yet they will not down: nay it
is well if it be not so ill with many of us, that we return him bitter words
for his bitter pills, and storm against him, who hereby brings to us the
quiet fruit of righteousness, insani adversus antidotum, quo fani esse
possimus, growing mad against the remedy of our madness. For are we not come
to that pass, Ut nec morbos nec remedia far possimus, that we can neither
endure our pain, nor abide the cure? Romans 5.3.
Tribulation (says the Apostle) brings patience: It should do so indeed,
and through the power of grace it does so in perfect Christians; but the
contrary is verified in the greater part of men. Tribulation brings
impatience, not of it self, but according to the disposition of the patient;
as wholesome potions given to generate good blood, in a foul stomach turn to
choler. In this case the Physicians prescribe purges. Purges are to be given
according to the nature of the humor to be purged; and therefore the cure of
the malady begins at the knowledge of the cause, which in this will be found to
be the relics of original corruption, nourished by the ill diet of the
soul, immoderately glutting her self with sensual delights, and much
increased by false opinions.

To begin with the sink of original sin, sending up noisome fumes and
vapors, which distemper the inward man. Of other things, as peace of
conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, we easlier speak than conceive them,
and easlier conceive them what they may be in others, than sensibly apprehend
them in our selves; but we feel rather than understand, and understand better
than we can express this hereditary disease and habitual depravation of our
whole nature. It is that corrupt humor, or malignant quality drawn from the
loins of our first parents, which tainteth our blood, surpriseth our vital
faculties, stops or much hinders the motions of Gods Spirit, and the
operations of this grace in us; so that we neither can do, nor suffer the
will of God without regret and reluctance. It is the prima materia of all
diseases, the tinder of natural lusts, easily set on fire with hell: it
disposes us to all evil, and breeds in us an averseness from all good: it
is not subject to the Romans 7.23.
Law of God, neither can it be; it rebelleth against the law of our mind, and
enthralleth us to sin and Satan, and even after we are freed from the dominion
of sin, so fettereth our feet, that we cannot with any expedition run the
ways of Gods commandments. Though the prosperous gales of Gods Spirit drive
us toward the haven where we would be; yet the main tide of our corruption
runs so strong the contrary way, that we much float, and sail but flowly.
Saint Peter, no doubt, after our Savior acquainted him with the kind of death
whereby he was to glorify God, did his best to incline his will that way; yet
he could not keep it to that bent, but that it slacked and bowed another way,
as Christ's words imply: Ducent te quo nolis, They shall John 21.18
lead thee whither thou would not. He says not they shall draw thee, but
they shall lead thee. Peter therefore was in some sort willing to go with them
that led him to the cross, yet he somewhat shrinked at it: though the spirit
was strong in him, yet the flesh was weak. Who ever did or suffered more for
the Gospel than Saint Paul? yet he professes that in regard of the law of
sin in his members, the Romans 7.19.
good which he would do he did not, and the evil which he would not do, that
he did. And being thus crossed in all his godly desires and endeavors, he
cries out, O Romans 7.24.
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?

Ye see now the root of bitterness set so deep in our hearts, that it cannot
be plucked up till we are transplanted: there is no hope in this life to purge
out this matter of continual diseases, it is so mingled with our radical
moisture, the balsamum of our lives; only we may abate it by subtracting
nourishment from it, and allay the force of it by strengthening nature against
it by prayers, godly instructions, and continual exercises of religious duties.

A nearer cause of our so great distemper in afflictions we owe to the
delights of our prosperity, which, as the pleasures of Capua did Hannibals
soldiers, so weaken our minds, and make us so choice and tender, that we
cannot bear the weight of our own armor, much less the strokes of an
enraged enemy. The Hieron. ad Heliod. Corpus assuetum tunicis loricae onus non
fert, caput opertum linteo galeam recusat, mollem otio manum durus exasperat
capulus.
body used to soft raiment, cannot bear the weight of an helmet, the head
wrapped in silk night-caps, cannot endure an iron headpiece, the hard hilt
hurts the soft hand. It was wisely observed by the Senec. sent. Res adversae
non frangunt, quos prosperae non corruperunt.
Heathen Sage, that none are broken with adversity, but such as were weakened
before, and made crazie by ease and prosperity. Sound trees are not blown
down with the wind, but the roots rather fastened thereby; but corrupt trees
eaten with worms, engendered of superfluous moisture, are therefore thrown
down by the least blast, because they had no strength to resist. Why do losses
of goods so vex us, but because we trusted in uncertain riches? Why is
disgrace a Courtiers hell, but because he deemed the favor of the Prince, and
places of honorable employment his heaven? We are therefore astonished at our
fall, because sometimes with David in the height of our worldly felicity we
said, We shall never be Psalm. 30.6.
moved. If when we had the world at will, we had used the things of this life
as if we used them not: now in the change of our estate, our not using them
would be all one as if we used them. The best means to assuage the pains of
affliction when it shall befall us, will be in the time of our wealth to abate
the pleasures of prosperity: if we sauce all our earthly joys with godly
sorrow, all our worldly sorrow shall be mixed with much spiritual joy and
comfort. Let us not over-greedily seek, nor highly esteem, nor immoderately
take, nor intemperately joy in the delights and comforts which wealth and
prosperity afford, and the rod of Gods afflicting hand shall fall but lightly
upon us. Let us not so fill our hearts with temporary pleasures, but that we
leave some place for these and the like sad and sober thoughts: What are
riches, honors, pleasures, and all the contentments of this life, that because
I enjoy them for the present, I should take so much upon me? The Devil
offers them, the wicked have them, Gods dearest children often want them:
therefore they are not eagerly to be sought. They are not good but in their
use, nor things but for a moment, nor ours but upon trust: therefore not
greatly to be esteemed. They, without store of grace in our selves, and good
counsels from others, strengthen the flesh, weaken the spirit, nourish carnal
lusts, choke all good motions, cloy our bodily, and wholly stupifie our
ghostly senses, cast us into a dead sleep of security, but awake Gods
judgments against us: therefore they are sparingly to be tasted, not greedily
to be devoured.

These and the like meditations are not only good preservatives in prosperity,
but also lenitives in adversity: as they help us to digest and Pind. od. 1.
(...).
concoct felicity, so they strengthen us to bear misery. All that we now
possess, and the world so much doteth upon, what are they in their nature and
condition but things indifferent? therefore we ought to be indifferently
affected to them, and the contrary: they are transitory, what strange thing
then is it, if they pass from us? they are far inferior to the immortal
spirit that quickneth our bodies, therefore cannot the want of them deprive it
of happiness: they are not our inheritance for ever, nor our donatives or
legacies for life, but talents for a while committed to us, to employ them to
our Masters best advantage: therefore the restoring them back is no mulct, but
a surrender; no loss, but a discharge. The more of this sort we are trusted
with, the more liable we are to an account: how then are we hurt or endammaged
by the diminution of that which lessens our accounts? Finally, they are often
effects of Gods wrath, and their effects usually are sensuality, security, and
stupidity, against which afflictions are a special remedy. To extract then the
quintessence of the herbs and flowers of Paradise, and make of them a cordial
to comfort us in worldly losses. Nothing is absolutely good but God, all other
things respectively only; temporal blessings, as they proceed from his love,
and may be employed to his glory, in this respect only to be desired and loved.
If then we affect God in them, and enjoy them in God, and it be made apparent
unto us, that afflictions and losses are sometimes more certain tokens of Gods
love, and that they minister unto us more matter and greater occasion of
testifying our love to him, and means of setting forth his glory, we should be
rather glad than sorrowful when God sees it best for us, to exchange the
former for the latter.

Yea but the forlorn Christian (out of all heart, because in his conceit out
of Gods favor) will reply, Show me that the countenance of God is not changed
toward me, nor his affections estranged from me, and it suffices: surely
kissings and embracings, not blows and strokes, are love complements; how may
I be persuaded that God lays his heavy cross upon me in love? Nay, how
can thou not be persuaded, since he himself has said it, I chasten as many
as I love? which words that thou may take more hold of, he has often
repeated them in holy Scripture. Desire thou greater assurance than his
words, which is all that heaven and earth have to show for their continuance?
yet if thou desire more, rather helps of thine infirmity, than confirmations
of this truth, observe who are oftenest and longest under Gods afflicting hand,
who are fullest of his marks: if they are deepest in sorrow, who are highest
in his favor: if they mourn in Sion, who sing Halelujah in the heavenly
Jerusalem: if they go in black and sables here, who are arrayed in long white
robes there: if they lay their heart a soake in tears, who are men after Gods
own heart: if Benjamins portion be greatest in afflictions, assuredly manifold
tribulations and Gods favor may stand together. In the truth of which
assertion all those Texts of Scripture may establish us, which set before us
the sweet fruits that are gathered from the cross: as,

1. Knowledge: It is good for me that I have been Psa. 119.71.
afflicted, that I may learn thy statutes.

2. Zeal: I will Hosea 5.15.
go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offenses, and seek
my face: in their affliction they will seek me diligently.

3. Repentance: I truly am Psalm. 38.17, 18.
set in the plague, and my heaviness is ever in my sight: I will confess my
wickedness, and be sorry for my sins. When the people were stung with fiery
serpents, they came to Moses and said, We have Number. 21.7.
sinned: for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee. And again, In
their 2 Chro. 15.4.
trouble they turned to the Lord God of Israel, and sought him, and he was
found of them. When the Prodigal was pinched with famine, he came to himself
and said, How many hired Luke 15.16, 17, 18.
servants in my fathers house have meat enough, and I perish with hunger? I
will arise therefore and go to my father, etc.

4. Patience: Tribulation works Romans 5.3, 4.
patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.

5. Joy in the Holy Ghost: Receiving the Word with much affliction, with 1
These. 1.6.
joy in the Holy Ghost.

6. Trial of our faith, which like 1 Pet. 1.7.
gold is purged by the fire of afflictions. Though he Job 13.15.
slay me, yet will I trust in him. Our Psalm. 44.18, 19, 20.
heart is not turned back, nor our steps gone out of the way, no not when thou
have smitten us into the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shadow of
death.

7. Righteousness: No chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but
Heb. 12.11.
grievous: nevertheless, yet afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of
righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.

8. Holiness: It Heb. 2.10.
became him, for whom were all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to
consecrate the Captain of our salvation through afflictions. The Heb. 12.10.
fathers of our flesh for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure:
but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.

9. Estranging our affections from the world and earthly desires: Eliah
requested that he might dye, It is 1 Kin. 19.4.
enough, Lord, take away my life, I am no better than my fathers. We that are
in this tabernacle do 2 Cor. 5.4.
groan, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon,
that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

11. Humility: The 2 Cor. 12.7.
messenger of Satan was sent to buffet me; and that I should not be exalted
above measure, there was given me a thorn in my flesh.

11. Renovation and ghostly strength: Therefore I 2 Cor. 12.10.
take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions,
in distresses: for when I am weak, then am I strong, and though our outward
man decay, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.

12. Freedom from everlasting torments: When 1 Cor. 11.32.
we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be
condemned with the world.

13. Increase of celestial glory: For our 2 Cor. 4.17.
light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

The Heathen that never tasted the least part of these fruits, yet feeling by
experience, that the mind cloyed with continual felicity grew a burden to it
self, was deprived hereby of matter and occasion of excellent virtues; and not
so only, but infatuated and wholly corrupt thereby, maintained this memorable
Paradoxe, Demet. apud Sen. Nihil eo infelicius cui nihil intelix contigit.
That none was so unhappy as be who knew no mishap nor adversity at any time.
Nay they went farther in that their conceit, and thereby came nearer to my
text, affirming that store of wealth, large possessions, high places, and great
honors, were not always signs and tokens of the love of God. God, says the
wise Poet (and the best Philosopher takes it out of him) Aristot Rhet. l. 2
(...)
sends many men great prosperity, not out of love and good will, but to the
end that they may be capable of greater misery, and that the calamities which
they are after to endure may be more ^uven sit. Numerosa parabat excelsae
turris tabulata, unde altior esset casus, and impulsae praeceps immane rumae.
eminent and signal: -- Tolluntur in altum
Ut lapsu graviore ruant.
Misery is always querulous, and even weak objections often ruin them who
are already cast down with grief: such as are these; Does not God threaten to
power out his plagues upon the wicked? Do we not read in Saint Romans 2.9.
Paul, Tribulation and anguish upon every soul that sins, of the Jew first,
and also of the Gentile? Are not losses, infamy, captivity, banishment,
tortures and torments, judgments of wrath? how then can they be arguments of
love? I answer, that originally all the evils of this life came in with sin,
and were punishments of it; and they retain their nature still in the wicked:
but in the godly, by the mercy of God, and merits of Christ, they are changed
from judgments of wrath, into chastisements of love; from stings of sin, to
remedies against sin; from executions of vengeance, to exercises of excellent
virtues: and the inflicting of them so little prejudiceth Gods love to his
chosen, that he no way more shows it to them than by thus awaking them out
of their sleep, and by this means pulling them out of hell fire. And
therefore the Prophets threaten it after all other judgments, as the greatest
of all, that for their obstinacy and impenitency God would punish them no more:
Isa. 1.5.
Why should ye be stricken any more, says the Lord? which is as if a
Physician should say concerning his desperate Patient, I will minister no more
physic to him, give him what he has a mind unto, because there is no hope
of life in him. As it is a loving part in a Tutour to correct his Scholar
privately for a misdemeanour, to save him from the heavier stroke of the
Magistrate, or the Jaile: so it is a singular favor of God to chasten his
children here, that they may not be condemned with the world hereafter. I end
the solution of this doubt with the peremptory resolution of Saint Bernard: In
Cant. Si Deus non est recum per gratiam, adetit pre^ vindictam: sed vae tibi si
ita recum adest, imo vae ibi si ita tecum non did.
If God be not with thee, O Christian, by grace, he will be with thee by
vengeance or judgment here; and woe be to thee if he be so with thee, nay
woe be unto thee if he be not so with thee, or not so even with thee: for if
thou art preserved from temporal chastisements, thou art reserved to eternal
punishments.

The last doubt that rises in the mind of the broken hearted Christian, to
be assoyled at this time, is drawn from the words of the wise man; Eccl. 9.2.
All things fall alike unto all men, the same net takes clean and unclean
fowls, and enwrappeth them in a like danger. In famine what difference
between the Elect and Reprobate? both pine away: In pestilence what
distinction of the righteous and the sinner? both are alike struck by the
Angel: In captivity what privilege has he that fears God more than he
that fears him not? both bear the same yoke: In hostile invasion how can
we discern who is the child of God, and who is not; when all are slaughtered
like sheep, and their blood like water spilt upon the ground?

who only knows who are his intruth and sincerity; Noah from the deluge of
water which drowned the old world; as he did Lot from the deluge of fire,
which overwhelmed and burnt Sodom and Gomorrah; as he did the children of
Israel in Goshen from the plagues of Egypt; as he did Moses from the massacre
of the infants by Pharaoh; as he did Elias from the sword of Jezebel drunk
with the blood of the Prophets; as he did all those Christians among the
Romans, that fled to the Sepulchers of the Martyrs, when the city was sacked
by the Aug. l. 1. de civ. Dei. c. 1.
Goths; as he did those pious children, who carried their fathers and mothers
upon their backs through the midst of the fire in the Towns near Aetna,
whereof C 6. (...).
Aristotle religiously discourses in his Book De mundo: When, says he, from
the hill Aetna there ran down a torrent of fire that consumed all the houses
thereabout, in the midst of those fearful flames Gods special care of the
godly shined most brightly: for the river of fire parted it self on this side
and that side, and made a kind of lane for those who ventured to rescue their
aged parents, and pluck them out of the jaws of death. To make an evident
distinction between the godly and the wicked we see here the fire divided it
self, as the waters before had done in the Exodus 14.22.
passage of the children of Israel through the red Sea. Howbeit these
exemptions and special protections in common calamities, are neither necessary
nor ordinary. substance of these things; I mean, houses, lands, treasure, and
wealth: but they have not them with that quality which makes them good; I
mean, the right use of them, and contentation of mind in them. On the
contrary, the godly often lack the substance of these things, yet not that for
which they are to be desired, and which makes them good, contentment of
mind, with supply of all things needful: in which regard the indigencie of
the godly is to be preferred before the plenty and abundance of the wicked;
according to that of the Psalmist, Psalm. 37.16.
A small thing that the righteous has is better than great riches of the
ungodly. And doubtless that large promise of our Savior, Mar. 10.29.
There is no man that has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or lands for my
sake and the Gospels, but he shall receive an hundred fold in this time, is to
be understood (according to the former distinction) thus; He shall receive an
hundred fold, either in the kind, or in the value; either in the substance of
the things themselves, or in the inward contentation, and the heavenly wealth I
now spoke of. In like manner death, and all calamities, which are as it were
sundry kinds of death, or steps unto it, have a sting and venomous quality,
which puts the soul to most unsufferable pain, and rankles, as it were,
about the heart: I mean Gods curse, the sense of his wrath, the worm of
conscience, discontent, impatience, despair, and the like: 1 Cor. 15.55.
O death (says Saint Paul) where is thy sting? In like manner we may insult
upon all other evils; O poverty, O banishment, O imprisonment, O losses, O
crosses, O persecutions, Where is your sting? it is plucked out of the
afflictions of the godly, but a worse left in the prosperity of the wicked: In
which regard the seeming misery of the godly is happy, but the seeming
prosperity of the wicked is miserable. Albeit God sometim s gives them both a
drink of deadly Wine, yet he tempereth the sharp Ingredients of judgment,
with corrective Spices of mercy, and sweetneth it with comforts in the Cup of
the godly. 2 Cor. 1.5.
As their sufferings for Christ abound, so their consolations also abound by
Christ. And this evidently appears by the different working of the Cup of
trembling in both: the wicked presently after their draught rave, and grow
frantic, but the godly are then in their best temper; the wicked Apoc. 16.10.
gnaw their tongues for sorrow, but the godly employ them in prayer and
praises; the wicked bite Gods iron rod, and thereby break their own teeth,
but the godly kiss it; the wicked are most impatient in afflictions, the godly
learn patience even by afflictions. In a word, the one in extremity of pain
are swallowed up with desparation, the other are ravished with Jam. 1.2.
exceeding joy, they are Romans 8.37.
more than conquerors in all these things through him that loves them; and
therefore they more than rejoice. Romans 5 3, 4, 5
For they glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation works patience, and
patience experience, and experience hope, and hope makes not ashamed, because
the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the holy Ghost, which is
given unto them. Upon this answer, after much agitation, Saint Austine settled
his judgment, when he saw much Christian blood mingled with the heathen in
diverse parts of Italy, spilt by the Goths: L. 1. c. 8. de Civ D i. Man^
dissimilitudo p^siotum in similitudine p^ssionum, and licet sub tormento non
est idem virtus and vitium. Nam sicut sub uno ign^ aurum rutil^t, p^l^a tumat;
and sub eadem tribula stipulae comminuuntur, frumenta purgan^ur; nec id^o oleum
cum amnica consunditur, quia eodem (...) pondere ^xprimitur, etc. Tantum
inter^st non qu^li^, sed qu^lis quoque patiatur.
Notwithstanding the likeness of the sufferings of both, there remains yet a
great dissimilitude in the sufferers: and even in the same torments virtue and
vice may be distinguished; in the same fire the gold shines, the chafe
smoaketh; under the same fla^le the corn is purged, the stubble bruised; under
the same press the oil is powered into vessels, the foame spilt. By all which
we see that perpetual felicity with security is a most fearful judgment of
God; and that seasonable afflictions with comforts to sweeten them, grace to
bear them, strength to overcome them, wisdom to make use of them, are
special favors of Gods chosen. Now the Lord of his infinite mercy, who
scourges every son whom he receives, receive us whom he scourges; he who
chasteneth whom he loves, love us whom he chasteneth; he who corrects us for
our profit, teach us to profit by his corrections, sanctify all crosses and
afflictions unto us, uphold us in them, carry us through them, purge us by
them, and crown us after them. Cui, etc.

THE SWEET SPRING OF THE WATERS OF MARAH. THE L. SERMON.
Apoc. 3.19. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten.


Right Honorable, etc.
SAint Cyp. de bon. patient. De patientia loquuturus, fratres dilectissimi, and
utilitates ejus and commoda praedicaturus, unde potius incipiam quam quod nunc

ipsum quod auditis and discitis sine patientia sacere possitis?
Ciprian having proposed to his auditory bonum patientiae, the good of bearing,
for his theme reckons (if I may so speak) upon the stock, and makes his
advantage of the very duty and service they were at that time to perform to
God, in affording to the Minister of his word their religious attention and
Christian patience. Being to treat of patience, says he, dearly beloved, and
to recount the sundry commodities that by it accrue to the sanctified soul,
whence shall I rather take my beginning than from the necessity of, this virtue
to the holy exercise we are now at; which cannot be performed as it ought,
without the concurrence of your patience with the divine assistance, and my
labor? I cannot speak profitably to you in commendation of patience, except
you hear me with patience. Mutato nomine de me
Fabula narratur.
This godly fathers case has bin, and yet is mine, who am to entreat your
patience to treat yet once more of patience in your hearing: and if the
handling often the same argument, and pressing the like motives to patience
has seemed wearisom and tedious unto you, I may hence gather with that father
an argument for patience, without which ye cannot endure the least affliction,
no not of the ear. But if the repeating and inculcating the like doctrine and
arguments were not burdensome unto you, I may safely presume upon your
patience, to seal up my text, and perfect my meditations upon so necessary and
profitable a subject. Sen. ep. Nunquam satis dicitur, quod nunquam satis
discitur.
We cannot hear too much of that which we can never learn enough. Sorrows and
disturbances are very many, and work strongly upon our frail nature; but
spiritual medicines of the souls maladies and comforts work but weakly:
therefore it is wisdom to take as many of them as we can. If they who are
subject to swouning, and generally all that are careful of their bodily
health, will have cordial waters in readiness at hand, that they may not be
to seek in time of need; how much more ought all Christians, who are still
either in fear, or in danger of conflicts with troubles and vexations, be
provided of store of spiritual comforts; the rather because they serve as well
to moderate their prosperity, as to mitigate their afflictions? For the same
meditations which some way sweeten the brine of affliction, that it be not too
salt and quick, sauce the pleasures of prosperity, that they be not too sweet
and luscious. What stronger levers to raise up a drouping soul, than these in
my Text, that afflictions proceed from God in love, and fall upon all his
dearest children for their good? Again, what stronger clubs to beat down
pride and insolency in all such as abound in earthly comforts, and know no end
of their wealth, and keep under the mind, that it be not too much lifted up
with temporal blessings, than these inferences from this Scripture, that God
chasteneth with afflictions, and pampers not up with pleasures, all such as he
bears a special affection unto? Therefore may they thus well reason with
themselves; For all our honor and wealth we are in no better, nay perhaps we
are in far worse estate than the poorest and miserablest creature upon earth,
that has run thorough or is in the midst of all calamities. God chasteneth him
in love for his amendment, but he has no care of us, he lets us run riot in
sin: that poor wretch has now his payment, ours is to come, we know not how
soon: he has his pain here with Lazarus, but we take out our pleasures with
Dives: therefore may it be just with God to change his pain into pleasures,
but our pleasures into everlasting pains. Better weep in Christ's school, than
sport at the Devils games: better to want all things and to have Gods love,
than to have all things else and want it. If it had not been better, Moses
would never have chosen to suffer afflictions with the servants of God, Heb.
11.15.
rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. These uses alone, if
there were no more to be made of this sovereign parcel of Scripture,
sufficiently recompense our labor, in decocting the spirits, and drawing this
oil of comfort out of it: but the more we try and apply it, the more virtue
we shall find in it, and use to be made of it. I have already counted many
particulars in my former discourses upon these words, and the supply of the
rest (together with the sum of the whole) shall be my task for the remainder
of the time. I will begin with the occasion, which was a deep wound of grief
which the Angel of Laodicea might seem to have received from that keen and
cutting reproof, Because thou art neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out
of my mouth. Now that he might not take on too far by reason of so grievous
and heavy a message, the Spirit verifieth his name Paracletus, and heals and
suppleth the wound with these comfortable words, As many as I love I rebuke and
chasten. Gather not too much upon my former sharp reproves and threats against
thine own soul, there is yet place for thy zealous repentance: despair not
of my favor, nor wrong my love in thy overweening conceit; I would not have
so rebuked thee, if I had not loved thee.

Are those that are in Gods place to rebuke sin, and chasten offenders, so
careful not to drive them to desperate courses? will they daigne as God here
does, to yield a reason of their proceedings, and mitigate their sharp
censures with favorable expositions, and take away all scruples out of men's
minds, which their speeches and actions might otherwise leave in them? Ye see
the occasion, and by it the scope of the Spirit, and connection of the words,
which carry this sense: I rebuke with conviction, and chasten with instruction
all those whom I love, not only at large, as I do all mankind; but in a
special manner, as I do those whom I intend to make heirs and co-heires with
my only begotten Son.

Here we have a special action of Gods careful providence over his children.
Now the actions of God may be considered in a double respect, either as they
come from the Sovereign of all power above us, or as he is the pattern of all
goodness to us: as they are actions of sovereignty, they require of us
obedience, and an awful and a trembling regard of them; as they are examples
of goodness, we are to seek to imitate them, and express them in our lives.
According to the former consideration, these actions of God, and words of my
Text, rebuke and chasten, strengthen those that are under the rod; but
according to the latter, they direct those that are to use it: the former when
they are chastened, the latter when they chasten, are to take notice of the
several circumstances set down in the Text. More particularly and plainly thus,

1. We learn out of the words Gods care of his, whom he reclaimes by threats
and chastenings from their evil courses.

2. The condition of the Church militant, which is seldom without rebukes and
chastenings.

3. The imperfection of inherent righteousness, and difficulty, or rather
impossibility of performing the Law now after our fall: all Gods dear children
are rebuked and chastened by him; and therefore are not without blame or fault:
These are the special observations.

Their use must be to inform our judgment in the true estimate of the things
of this life, to stir up our love to God, who takes such care of and pains
with us (as it were) to call us home unto him by threatening of judgments, and
correcting us with a fatherly and compassionate affection. Let us yet resume
the words, and consider the proceedings of the Almighty, and we shall see in
God his actions, the Magistrate his direction and charge, and in the Magistrate
his charge of distributing these tokens of Gods love, the duty of all
inferiors, to receive them with the same affection wherewith they are given.
The Minister is to reprove, the Judge to convince, the Father to nurture, the
Magistrate to punish, the Master to discipline those that are under them
without partiality, with moderation and in love: those that are under their
authority they may not revile, but rebuke; not torment, but chasten; not some
in a spleen, but all in love, by the example of the Spirit in my Text: God
rebukes whom he likes, and chasteneth whom he rebukes, and loves whom he
chasteneth. Amor ille fraternus, says Saint Aug. confess. lib. 10. c. 4.
Respirent in bonis, suspirent in malis.
Austine, we may say paternus sive approbet me, sive improbet me diligit; O
that fatherly mind, which whether it approve me, or reprove me, still loves
me, is worth all. Amor (says the old man in the Poet) est optimum
salsamentum; Love is the best sauce of all: it gives a relish to those things
that are otherwise most distastefull and loathsome. It is most true of Gods
love: for it makes rebukes grateful, and even chastenings comfortable; I
rebuke and chasten as many as I love. Happy are we, if we are of these many;
for Job 5.17.
blessed is he whom God corrects. Howsoever all chastening seems grievous
unto us for the present, yet it after brings the Heb. 12.11.
quiet fruit of righteousness to those that are exercised thereby. Wherefore
it is worth the observation, that David prays not simply, O Lord, rebuke me
not, neither chasten me; for that had been as much as to say, O Lord, love me
not: for God rebukes and chasteneth every one whom he loves; but he adds,
Psalm. 6.1.
Rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thine heavy
displeasure: or, as Junius rendereth it out of the Hebrew, in aestu irae tuae,
in the heat of thy wrath.

I rebuke. Was it enough to allay and cool the boiling rage of the young man
in the comedy, Pater est, and si non pater esses; were thou not my father?
shall not this word I in my Text, and this consideration, that Gods hand is in
all our afflictions, be more forcible to quell the surges of our passions
within the shore of Christian patience, that they break not forth, and foam out
our own shame? It was the speech of Laban and Bethuel, though devoid of the
knowledge of the true God, Genesis 24.50.
This thing is proceeded of the Lord, we cannot therefore say neither good nor
evil. We who are better instructed must alter the words, and say, This thing
is proceeded of the Lord, this cross is sent us from him; therefore we cannot
but say good of it: we must thank him for it. In this loss, sickness,
disgrace, banishment, imprisonment, or whatsoever affliction is befallen us,
the will of our heavenly Father is done upon us; and is it not our daily
prayer, Fiat voluntas tua, Thy will be done? Look we to the author and
finisher of our salvation, he bowed his will to take upon it his Fathers
yoke: shall we with a stiff neck refuse it? Father (says he) let this cup
pass, let it pass, if it be possible let it pass. Ye hear he prays thrice
against the drinking of it with all possible vehemence and earnestness; yet
presently he yields to forgo his will, and undergo his passion: Sed fiat
voluntas tua, non mea; But thy will be done, not mine: or, Nevertheless, not
as I Mat. 26.39.
will, but as thou will. Not as I will, these words imply an unwillingnesse;
Nevertheless, be it done as thou will, shows a resolute will: here is a
consent of will without a will of consent, a will against a will, or a will and
not a will: Non mea, sed tua. As man he expressed a natural fear of death and
desire of life, yet with a submission to the will of his Father: it was not his
will to take that cup for it self, and antecedently, and as he saw wrath in
it; yet as he saw the salvation of man in it, and greater glory, it was his
will to drink it off consequently, because such was his Fathers good pleasure,
to which his will was always subordinate. Saint Cyp. de bono patient. Dominus
secit voluntatem Patris sui, nos non faciemus and patiemur voluntatem Domini?
Cyprian speaks home in this point to all that repine at what God sends
them, be it never so bitter to their carnal taste: Our Lord did, and suffered
the will of his Father, shall not we do and suffer the will of our Lord? he
conformed his will to his Fathers, shall not we ours to his? If these
inducements from the love of God and example of our Savior, which prevail
most with the best dispositions, work not kindly with us, let vulgar and
common discretion teach us to make a virtue of necessity. Suffer we must what
God lays upon us: for who can Romans 9.19.
resist his will? If we suffer with our will, we gain by our sufferings a
heavenly virtue for a worldly loss or cross; we make a grace of a judgment:
if we suffer against our will, we suffer nevertheless, and lose all benefit of
our sufferings. We add drunkenness to thirst, and impatience to impenitence,
passive disobedience to active, and what does obstinacy and rebellion against
the will of God avail us? Do the waves get by their furious beatings against
the rocks, whereby they are broken? the bones in our body by resisting the
lightening, whereby they are bruised and consumed (the soft and yielding flesh
being no way hurt?) The strong and tallest trees by their stiff standing, and
setting themselves as it were against the wind, give the wind more power over
them to blow them down to the ground, and tear them up by the root, whereas
the reeds and bents, by yielding to every blast, overcome the wind, and in the
greatest and most blustering storm keep their place and standing. Alas, the
more we struggle, and strive, and tugge to pluck our neck out of Gods yoke,
the more pain we put our selves to; the oftener and stronger we kick at the
pricks of Gods judgments, the deeper they enter into our heels: Vae
oppositis voluntatibus: quid tam poenale, quam semper velle quod nunquam erit?
and semper nolle quod nunquam non erit? inaeternum non obtinere quod vult, and
quod non vult inaeternum sustinere?
Woe be to these cross wills (says St. Bernard) they shall never attain what
they would, and they shall ever sustain and endure what they would not. As
grace in the godly is a means to procure the increase of grace: as the cymball
of Africa sweetly tinckleth, Ipsa meretur augeri, ut aucta mereatur; so
punishment in the wicked, through their impatience, becomes a means to
improve both their sins and punishments: for after they have suffered for not
doing the will of God, they are again to suffer, and that most deservedly, for
their not suffering patiently their most deserved punishments. If any be so
wedded to their wills, that they will not be severed from it, no not to join
it and themselves to God, let them in the last place consider, that the only
means to have their will perpetually, is to resign it to God; not only
because Voluntas inordinata est, quae non est subordinata; The will which is
not subordinate to God, is inordinate, and therefore not to be termed will, but
lust; but especially, because such is the condition proposed to us by God,
either to suffer temporal chastisements for our sins with our wills, or
eternal punishments against our wills. If we will have our will in all things
here, we shall want it for ever hereafter; but if we will be content to want
our wills here in some things for a time, we shall have our will in all things,
and fill also of heavenly contentments for evermore hereafter.

And chasten. If all afflictions of the godly are chastenings, and all
chastenings are for instruction, then to make the right use of them, we are not
only in general, but also in particular to search our selves, what those sins
are in our souls, which God seeks to kill in us by smart afflictions. If our
affliction be worldly losses, let us consider with our selves, whether our sin
were not covetousness: if disgrace and shame, whether our sin were not
ambition: if scarcity and famine, whether the sin were not luxury: if bodily
pains, torments, or aches, whether we offended not before in sinful
pleasures: if a dangerous fall, whether the fault were not confidence in our
own strength: if trouble of mind, and a fit of despair, whether before we
provoked not God by security and presumption. This to have bin the practice of
Gods Saints, as in other examples, so we may clearly see in the brethren of
Joseph, who impute the hard measure that was met to them in Egypt, to the like
hard measure they had met to their brother Joseph, saying one to another: Genesis
42.21.
We verily sinned against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul,
when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this anguish come
upon us. We find it also in Saint Paul, who conceived that the 2 Cor. 12.7.
messenger of Satan was sent to buffet him, that he might not be lifted up
above measure with his so many graces and special revelations: And when
certain virgins ravished by barbarous soldiers, in regard they found in
themselves no spot of impurity before they suffered this violence, called in
question the justice of God, for permitting those unclean persons to have their
will of them, who had all their life preserved their honor and reputation
untainted, and their bodies unspotted, Saint Lib. 1. de civit. Dei, c. 28.
Austine wisely advises them to search their hearts, whether those insolent
indignities offered them by the worst of men, might not be a punishment of some
other sin, rather than unchastity; and in particular, whether their sin
were not their pride of this virtue, and too highly prizing their virginity:
for pride even of virginity is as foul a sin before God as impurity.

As many. Experience teaches us, that what we see in water seems greater
than it is. It is most true, if we speak of the waters of Marah, they make any
thing that befalls us appear greater than it is: See if there be any Lam.
1.12.
sorrow like unto my sorrow, says captive Judah. I am the Lam. 3.1.
man, says Jeremy, that has seen affliction (as if none but he had seen the
like:) in like manner David, and after him Jonah 2.3, 4.
Jonas: All thy waves and storms have gone over me. What more direct Text of
Scripture to check and reprove this fancy than this, As many as I love I
rebuke and chasten? All Gods dearest children first or last are visited as well
as we, and those perhaps more grievously by whom it is least seen: our
affliction is in body, theirs may be in their mind: our losses may be of
transitory goods and worldly wealth, theirs may be of spiritual graces, or the
like; so that howsoever we amplify our miseries, yet all things considered,
we shall have small reason to exchange them with any other.

As I love. To many other reasons before touched, two may be added why
afflictions may proceed from Gods love.

The first, because they make the mind soft and tenderly affected, and thereby
apter to receive a deep impression from love. Excellent to this purpose is that
meditation of St. Gregor. in Cant. 2.5. Corda nostra male s^na sunt, cum nullo
Dei amore sautiantur, cum peregrinationis erumnam non sentiunt, cum nullo erga
proximum affectu languescunt; sed vulnerantur ut sanentur, quia amoris spiculis
mentes Deus insensibiles percutit, moxque sensibiles per ardorem charitatis
reddit.
Gregory upon those words of the Spouse in the Canticles, as he rendereth them,
vulnerata charitate ego, I am sick of love: Our hearts are indisposed when
they are not wounded with the love of God, when they feel not the trouble and
misery of our pilgrimage, when they pine not away through ardent desires and
longing to be with God; but they are wounded that they may be healed: God
strikes our minds and affections with the darts of love, that they may have
more sense and feeling of celestial objects.

The second is, because affliction estrangeth our affections from the world,
and entirely fixes them upon God, which before were divided between him and
the world. Now it is most proper to love to appropriate the object beloved to
it self; whom we entirely affect, we desire to have entire to our selves, and
none other to have part with us.

To draw toward an end; those many whom Christ here chasteneth distributive,
or one by one, are collective the militant Church, whose members we are: her
rebukes are our shame, her chastenings our discipline, her affliction our
condition, either by passion of grief or compassion of love. Behold then what
is her usage in her pilgrimage upon earth; her greetings are rebukes, her
visits chastenings, her love tokens crosses, her bracelets manicles, her
chains fetters, her crisping-pins thorns and nails, her drink tears, her
marks black and blew wounds, her true emblem Mat. 2.18.
Rachel mourning for her children, and refusing all comfort because they are
not. A wife of pleasures had been no fit match for him, who is described by the
Prophet to be a man of sorrows, with a head crowned with thorns, eyes big
with tears, cheeks swollen with buffets, his heart pricked with a spear, his
hands and feet pierced with nails, his joints set on the rack of the Cross,
his whole body bruised with stripes, and torn with whips and scourges. Ecce
homo; Behold the man, and judge whether is likelier to be his consort, the
Whore of Babylon, or the mother of our faith: the one sits upon many waters,
the other is ready to be overwhelmed with a flood cast out of the mouth of the
Dragon at her: the one is arrayed with purple and scarlet, the other in
mourning weeds, stained with her own blood: the one adorned with chains of
gold, the other clogged with fetters of iron: the one for many ages treading on
the necks of Kings and Princes, the other trodden down by them at the foot of
Christ's Cross. But be of good cheer, thou afflicted and disconsolate Spouse,
let not the pomp and beauty of thy corrivall be an eyesore unto thee:
according to the Rev. 18.7.
measure of her pleasures shall her torments be. It cannot now be long,
forbear a while, and she shall be stripped of all her gay attire, but thou
clothed in a vesture of gold wrought about with diverse colors: when she shall
be carried with sorrow and heaviness to the dungeon of everlasting darkness,
thou shall with joy and gladness be brought into the Kings chamber: thy
cheeks now blubbered with tears, shall be decked with rubies, and thy neck
with chains; he will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

Here I might make an end: for what out of the words of the Spirit in my Text
has bin spoken to cheer up the Spouse of Christ, bewailing her deplorate
estate, belongs to every faithful soul that has her part in her mothers
griefs. Howbeit, more distinctly to propose the instructions and comforts laid
out in this Scripture to your most serious consideration, and apply them to
those in particular whom they most concern, may it please you to sort with me
all the members of the militant Church into 1. Those that are comforted, but in
fear of affliction. 2. Those that are afflicted, but in hope of comfort.


All that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer affliction; and therefore
all necessarily fall under the members of this division: for the former the
Spirit in my Text points to this exhortation.

Ye whom God has enriched with store, graced with preferments and honor,
prospered with all happiness amidst your pleasures, jollity, and mirth,
remember the affliction of Joseph, and despise not the condition of Lazarus,
but partake with them in their sorrows by compassion, and take part from them
by your charitable relief: their turn of sorrow is come, and near past,
yours is to come; they are now rebuked and chastened, ye may be, nay ye shall
be, if ye are of those in my Text, on whom God casts a special eye of
favor: if ye are not of those, then is your condition worse than that of the
poorest Lazar. Beware of flattering tongues as of Serpents stings, or rather
more of those than these: for those venom but the flesh, and make it swell,
these corrupt the soul, putrify it with lust, and make it swell with pride.
If honors, riches, and pleasures were certain arguments of Gods love and
favor, the dearest of his children could not be so often without them as they
are. Value not your selves by these outward vanities, but by inward virtues,
take heed how ye drink deep of the sugered wine of pleasures, set not your
hearts upon the blessings of this life; for then they will cease to be
blessings unto you, nay they are already become curses, because they withdraw
you from God, which is a kind of death of the soul. How then may we know, that
they are undoubtedly blessings of God unto us, that we may rejoice and take
comfort in them? By this: If we over-joy not in them, if they diminish not, but
contrariwise increase our love of God: if they serve as instruments and
encouragements of virtue, not nourishments of vices: if our expense on the
poor be some way answerable to our receipts from God: if we love them only for
his sake that gave them, and for his sake are willing to part with them. Lib.
de mirab. cuscuit.
Aristotle writes of a parcel of ground in Sicilie, that sends such a
strong smell of fragrant flowers to all the fields and leazes there-about, that
no Hound can hunt there, the sent is so confounded with the sweet smell of
those flowers: Consider (I beseech you) this seriously with your selves,
whether the sweet pleasures of the world have not produced a like effect in
your souls; whether they have not taken away all sent and sense too of
heavenly joys; whether they hinder you not in your spiritual chase: if not,
ye may take the greater joy and comfort in them, because it is an argument of
rare happiness not to be overcome of earthly delights, not to be corrupted
with temporal happiness. But if ye find that these transitory delights and
sensual pleasures have distempered your taste, in such sort that ye cannot
relish heavenly comforts: if they have made your hearts fat, as the Prophet
speaks, so that the spirits of your devotion are dull and gross, and ye are
altogether insensible of Gods judgments, then re-call your minds from those
pleasant objects, and represent to your conceits the loathsome deformity of
your sins, the fearful ends of those that are rich, and not in God, the vanity
of earthly comforts, and the heavy judgments which ye have deserved by being
not made better but worse by Gods benefits. These very thoughts will be as
rebukes and inward chastenings, which if they work in you godly sorrow and
unfeigned humiliation, God will spare further to afflict you who are already
wounded at the heart, or humble you whom he finds already humbled. Now for
those that are under Gods hand, afflicting them outwardly with any scourge, the
Spirit lays forth this exhortation: It is God that rebukes you; justify
therefore not your selves, acknowledge your sins, that he Psalm. 51.4.
may be justified in his sayings, and clear when he is judged: it is he that
chasteneth you, resist not, but submit and amend: he rebukes and chasteneth
you in love, repine not at it, but be thankful. What folly is it to resist
Gods will? I. What profit to be nurtured? chasten. What honor to be admitted
into Christ's School, and ranked with Gods dearest children? as many. What
comfort to be assured of Gods love? as I love. The wheat is purged by the
flaile, the gold tried by the fire, the vine pruned by the knife, the diamonds
valued by the stroke of the hammer, the palm grows up higher by pressing it
down, the pomander becomes more fragrant by chasing. If your afflictions be
many and very grievous, know that God makes not choice of a weak champion, be
assured that he will lay no more upon you than he will enable you to bear.
Soldiers glory in their wounds which they receive in war for their King and
Country: have not we much more cause to glory in them which we endure for the
love of God? What joy will it be at that day, when the Son of man comes with
the clouds, and lays open his scarres before all the world, to have in our
bodies store of his sufferings, and to be able to show like stripes and wounds
to his? Possess your souls therefore in patience for a while, and on the
sudden all prisons shall be opened, all chains loosened, all stripes healed,
all wrongs revenged, all your sufferings acknowledged, all your miseries ended,
and your endless happiness consummated. I end in the phrase of the Psalmist:
Though in the great heat of affliction and persecution ye look as if ye had
lien among the pots, yet ye shall be as a Psalm 68.13. As a dove covered with
silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.
dove, whose feathers are silver, and wings of pure gold, wherewith your souls
shall fly into heaven, and there abide and nest with Cherubins and Seraphins
for ever. Deo P^^^, Filio, and Spiritui sancto sit laus, etc.

THE PATTERN OF OBEDIENCE. THE LI. SERMON.
PHIL. 2.8. He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
death of the Cross.


Right Honorable, etc.
OPposita juxta se posita magis elucescunt, contraries are illustrated by their
contraries; the dark shadow makes the picture show more lightsome, the black
veil the face more beautiful, a gloomy cloud the beams of the sun breaking
out of it more bright and conspicuous, sickness health more grateful, pain
pleasure more delightful, affliction and misery prosperity and happiness more
desirable: in like manner the obscurity and infamy of Christ's passion sets
off the glory of his resurrection. Neither does it illustrate it only, but
demonstrateth it also a priori; for his humiliation was the meritorious cause
of his exaltation, his obedience of his rule, his cross of his crown: so
says the Apostle in the next verse, therefore has God highly exalted him. As
we cannot certainly know how high the surface of the sea is above the earth,
but by sounding the depth with a plummet, or diving to the bottom thereof; so
neither can we take the height of our Lords exaltation, but by measuring from
the ground of his humiliation. The cross is the Jacobs staff whereby to take
the elevation of this morning star; and as Ezekiah was assured that fifteen
years were added forward to his life, by the going back of the sun ten
degrees in the Dial of Ahaz, so we know that 1500. years, nay eternity of
life and glory is added to our Savior, by the going back so many degrees in
the Dyall of his passion, in the which the finger points to these four: 1
Humility. 2 Obedience. 3 Death. 4 Cross.
These self same steps and stairs by which he descended in his passion, he
ascended in his exaltation; upon these therefore my discourse shall run,
humility and the manner of his humility, obedience: his death and the manner
of his death, his cross. How low must the descent needs be, where humility and
lowliness it self is the uppermost greece? Beneath it lies obedience: for a
man may be humble in himself, and yet not voluntarily bow his neck to
another man's yoke; He humbled himself, and became obedient. Obedient a man
may be, and yet not ready to lay down his life at his Masters pleasure; he
became obedient unto death. Obedient to death a man may be, and yet not
willing to be put to an infamous, cruel, and accursed death; he became
obedient to death, even the death of the cross. The repeating the word death
seems to argue an ingemination of the punishment, a suffering death upon
death. It was wonderful that he which was highest in glory should humble
himself; yet it is more to be obedient than to humble himself; more to
suffer death willingly, or upon the command of another, than to be obedient;
more to be crucified than simply to die. He was so humble that he became
obedient, so obedient that he yielded to die, so yielded to die as to be
crucified: his love wonderfully showed it self in humbling himself to exalt
us; his humility in his obedience; his obedience in his patience; his patience
in the death of the cross. His humility was a kind of excess of his love,
his obedience of his humility, his death of his obedience, his cross of his
death.

He humbled himself. According to which nature? divine or humane? In some sort
according to both: according to his divine, by assuming our nature; according
to his humane, by taking upon him our miseries.

And became obedient. It is not said he made himself obedient, because
obedience presupposes another command; we may indeed of our selves offer
service to another, but we cannot perform obedience where there is no command
of a Superior; parere and imperare are relatives. To whom then became he
obedient? To God, says Calvin; to Herod and Pilate, says Zanchius; the truth
is, to both: to God as supreme Judge, according to whose eternal decree; to
Pilate, by whose immediate sentence he was to suffer such things, of sinners,
for sinners.

To death. (...), whether inclusive or exclusive? whether is the meaning, he
was obedient all his life, even to his last gasp; or he was so far
obedient, that he yielded himself to the wrath of God, to the scorn of men,
the power of darkness, the infamy of all punishments, the shame of all
disgraces, the cruelty of all torments, the death of the cross? The difference
between these is in this, that the former makes death the limit and bound,
the latter an act of his obedience: to which interpretation I rather subscribe,
because it is certain that Christ was not only obedient unto the hour of his
death, but in his death also, and after his death, lying three days and three
nights in the grave. Here then we have the sum of the whole Gospel, the life
and death of our Lord and Savior: his birth and life in the former words, He
humbled himself: his death and passion in the latter, and became obedient unto
death, even the death of the cross. He humbled, that is, took on him our
nature and infirmities; and became obedient, that is, fulfilled the law for us
by his active, and satisfied God for our transgressions by his passive
obedience. Obedience most shows it self in doing or suffering such things as
are most cross and repugnant to our will and natural desires; as to part with
that which is most dear and precious to us, and to entertain a liking of that
which we otherwise most abhor. Now the strongest bent of all men's desires is to
life and honor; nothing men fear more than death, especially a lingering painful
death: they are confounded at nothing more than open shame: whereby our
Saviors obedience appears a non pareil, who passed not for his life, nor
refused the torments of a cruel, nor the shame of an ignominious death, that he
might fulfill his fathers will, in laying down a sufficient ransom for all
mankind.

Even the death of the cross. As the sphere (of the Sun or Saturn, etc.) is
named from the Planet which is the most eminent part of it; so is the passion
of Christ from his cross: the cross was as the center, in which all the
bloody lines met. He sweat in his agony, bled in his scourging, was pricked in
his crowning with thorns, scorned and derided in the judgment hall; but all
this, and much more he endured on the cross. Whence we may observe more
particularly, 1 The root. 2 Branches. 3 Fruit.
Or, 1 The cause. 2 The parts. 3 The end of all his sufferings on it.


1 Of the cause. S. Aug. l. 3. de Civ. Dei. c. 15. Regularis defectio non nisi
in lunae fine contingit.
Austin demonstrateth that the Eclipse of the sun at the death of our Savior
was miraculous, because then the Moon was at the full. Had it bin a regular
Eclipse the Moon should have lost her light, and not the Sun: so in the regular
course of justice, the Church, which is compared to the Moon in Cant. 6.10.
Scripture, should have been eclipsed of the light of Gods countenance, and not
Christ, who is by the Prophet Malachy styled Mal. 4.2.
Sol justitiae, the Sun of righteousness. But as then the Sun was eclipsed in
stead of the Moon, so was Christ obscured in his passion for the Church; he
became a surety for us, and therefore God laid all our debts upon him, to the
uttermost farthing. The Prophet Esaias assures us hereof, Esa. 53.4, 5.
He bare our infirmities, and carried our sorrows. He was wounded for our
transgressions and broken for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was
upon him, and by his stripes we are all healed. O the wonderful wisdom and
justice of God! the just is reputed unjust, that the unjust might be reputed
just: the innocent is condemned, that the condemned might be found innocent:
the Conqueror is in bonds to loose the captive: the Creditor in prison to
satisfy for the debtour: the Physician takes the bitter potion to cure the
patient: the Judge is executed to acquit the prisoner. What did the welbeloved
of his Father deserve, that he should drink the dregs of the vials of wrath?
why should the immaculate Lamb be put to such torture, and in the end be slain,
but for a sacrifice? why should the bread of life hunger, but for our gluttony?
the fountain of grace thirst, but for our intemperancy? the word of God be
speechless, but for our crying sin? truth it self be accused, but for our
errors? innocence condemned, but for our transgressions? why should the King of
glory endure such ignominy and shame, but for our shameful lives? why should
the Lord of life be put to death, but for our heinous and most deadly sins?
what spots had he to be washed? what lust to be crucified? what ulcers to be
pricked? what sores to be launced? Doubtless none at all: our corrupt blood
was drawn out of his wounds, our swellings pricked with his thorns, our sores
launced with his spear, our lusts crucified on his cross, our stains washed
away with his blood. It was the weight of our sins that made his soul heavy
unto death, it was the unsupportable burden of our punishment that put him into
a bloody sweat: all our blood was corrupt, all our flesh as it were in a
scurfe, from the Esa. 1.6.
crown of the head to the sole of the foot there was no soundness in us,
nothing but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores. For a remedy hereof our
Lord and Savior was let blood in all parts of his body; in his head when he
was crowned with thorns, in his hands and feet when he was pricked with nails,
in all the parts of his body when his flesh was torn with whips. After so much
blood drawn from him, there could be little left, except a few drops at the
heart: behold these also are drawn out by the Soldiers spear. The Adamant,
which nothing relenteth at the stroke of the hammer, yet is broken in pieces by
the warm blood of a goat. Beloved, if such abundance of the blood of the
immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus, trickling from his temples, dropping from his
stripes, running from his hands and feet, gushing from the hole in his side,
melt not our hearts, and resolve them into penitent tears, they are harder
than Adamant: not a compassionate tear can we wring out of our eyes for him,
who shed so much blood for us. We pray ordinarily, Remove, O Lord, from us our
stony hearts, and give us hearts of flesh: but O Lord, says Bonaventure, give
me rather a stony heart, and remove from me my fleshly; for the stones clave at
Christ's passion, but the fleshly hearts of men clave not; the veil rent it
self at the Mat. 27.51.
hearing of the blasphemies against the Son of God, yet we hear not of any of
the standers by that they tare their garments; the sun drew in his beams, the
heavens mourned in sables, the earth trembled for fear, the rocks were cleft
as it were with indignation, the graves opened to receive his dead corpse, and
hide it from further indignity: solus homo non compatitur, pro quo solo
Christus patitur, only man suffers not with him, for whom only he suffered;
only man shows no compassion, to whom alone Christ intended all the benefit of
his passion. We are affected at the hearing of a profane story, nay at the
representation of some tragical fiction we have tears at commands; yet (O
Savior let the merits of thy passion satisfy even for this our want of
compassion for thee) when we read or hear out of the sacred story of the
Evangelists, the most honorable personage that ever was, suffer the most
shameful indignities that ever were; the innocentest person that ever was,
laden with the most grievous and slanderous accusations that ever were; the
justest that ever was put to the cruellest torments that ever were, and all
this for our sake: do we take it to heart? do his stripes make any impression
in us? do the nails and spear that pierced him prick us with compunction?
do we compassionate his sorrow, admire his patience, magnify his love, detest
our sins the causes of his sufferings? The custom in many places is, that if
the son of a King commit a fault deserving punishment, his Page or some other
servant is whipped for him: and those Princes that are of tender natures, more
grieve at the sight than their servant for their suffering of a few stripes.
Dear Christians, in Christ's passion it was clean otherwise; for the Kings
son, the heir apparent of heaven was scourged for his servants: what, said I,
scourged? nay flayed with whips, nay buffetted with fists, smote with reeds,
pricked with thorns, bored with nails, pierced with a lance.

We have viewed the root, let us now behold the branches; which some will have
to be six, some five, some four, some three. They which divide Christ's
sufferings into six parts, term them so many voyages or poastings: first,
from his supper to the garden; secondly, from the garden to Annas; thirdly,
from Annas to Caiaphas; fourthly, from Caiaphas to Herod; fifthly, from Herod
to Pilat; sixthly, from Pilat to Golgotha. They who divide them into five, thus
reckon them: first, his agony: secondly, his taking: thirdly, his
arraignement: fourthly, his sentence: fifthly, the execution. They who into
four, account upon, first, his afflictions before he was taken: secondly, the
proceedings against him after he was taken by the Ecclesiastical Judges:
thirdly, before the secular: fourthly, the consummation of all, his death upon
the Cross. For brevity sake I reduce them to three: first, dolours and
terrors: secondly, abuses and indignities: thirdly, tortures and torments. The
first in the Garden, the second in the Palace, the third on the Cross.

First, in the garden we find him in an agony. What an agony is, sentitur
priusquam dicitur, none can say but he that has felt, and none ever felt such
an agony but our Savior. Conceive we at the same time all the veins of our
body streigned, all the sinews stretched, all the bones racked, what pain
must this needs be in the body? and how far greater a like to this in the
soul? This somewhat expresses his agony, which was an horror conceived from
the apprehension of his Fathers wrath, a conflict in his mind, and terrible
combat in all the parts of his soul. Judge ye of the extremity of his first
fit, both by the anteced^nts and the consequents; the antecedents, fear and
consternation, coepit expavescere, and Mat. 26.37, 38.
gravissime angi, he began to be affrighted and grievously troubled: torments
they must needs be, and sorrows more grievous than many deaths, at which the
son of God was aff^ighted. Secondly judge it by the consequents and eff^cts,
a strange sweat, with clottie blood trickling from all parts of his body. What
torments did not the blessed Martyrs endure? yet we never read that in any
extremity they were cast into Luke 22.44.
a bloody sweat. What labor must the mind needs be in when the body sweats
bloud^ St. Languet Christus in balneo sanguinis sui, and ^^et, non tantum
oculis, sed and omnibus membris.
Bernard is bold to say, that he languished in this bath of his blood; and not
only his eyes, but all parts of his body wept for us, and that with tears of
blood. We might well have thought that he would have gone away in this agony
and bloody sweat, but that an Luke 22.43.
Angel was sent to strengthen and comfort him, which was not done before nor
after; and therefore we may well imagine that now he was in the greatest
distress of all. Yet I gather this rather from his own speeches, My soul is
heavy unto Mat. 26.38.42.
death: Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me. It is impiety
in the highest degree to think that any martyr or Saint was endued with a
greater measure of patience than our Savior: yet who of that noble army when
they were condemned to merciless torments, and saw before their eyes crosses,
rackes, fiery pincers, burning furnaces, teeth of wild beasts, and all the
engines of cruelty and shapes of death, showed such tokens of grief, or
uttered such speeches of regret and reluctance? nay rather they for Christ's
sake desired them, and rejoiced in them. Something then it was above all the
torments man can devise, much less bear, that our Savior felt in his agony,
and expressed by his bloody sweat and strong cries. Whilst our Savior was in
this woeful plight, what do his Disciples? Do they condole him? pray with
him? arm themselves to defend him? Nay, in this fear and perplexity of their
Master they fall fast asleep at the first, and after in his greatest danger
forsake him; only Judas comes near him, and saluteth him with a kiss. O
that perfidious treachery should touch those lips in which there was no guile:
that he should be Cyp. de bon. patient. Insultantium sputamina exciperet, qui

caeteros vestit: cibaretur fell, qui cibum coelestem dedit: potaretur aceto,
qui poculum salutare propinavit.
spit upon, who cured the eyes of the blind with spittle: that his face should
be smitten with palms of the hand, who puts palms into the hands of all
that overcome: that he should be crowned with thorns, who crowns Martyrs with
never withering flowers: that he should be stripped of his earthly garments,
who arraies us with celestial robes: that he should be fed with gall, who
feeds us with bread from heaven: that vinegar should be given to him for
drink, who prepares for us the cup of salvation!

But before we go out of the garden, we will gather some flowers. As the first
sin was committed in a garden, so the first satisfaction was made in a
garden: in that garden there was an evil Angel tempting, in this garden a good
Angel comforting. Adams sentence in that garden was, that he should get his
living with the sweat of his brows; and in this the second Adam procures life
unto us by the sweat of his whole body. Adam was driven out of that garden by
an Angel brandishing a fiery blade, and our Savior is fetched out of this with
swords and staves, and brought into the high Priests palace, where he is most
injuriously dealt withal; they cannot hold their hands off him whilst he is
examined before the Judge, but, contrary to all law and good manners, they smite
him with staves at his arraignment. Yea, but they were but rude soldiers, or
fawning servants. Is there any more justice in the high Priest or the Council,
who not only take willingly any allegation against him, but also seek out for
false witnesses, and when they find none that were contests, yet they condemn
him, and that for no ordinary crime, but for blasphemy in the highest degree?
Neither were the Judges more unjust than the people mad against him, Away with
him, say they, away with him, Crucify him, crucify him. Why? what evil has
he done? Spare Barabbas, not him. What? save a murderer, and murder a Savior?
O ye people of Judea, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, what so enrageth you
against him? He has cleansed your lepers, he has cured your blind, he has
opened your deaf ears, he has loosened your tongue-tyed, he has healed your
sick, he has raised your dead, he has preached unto you the Gospel of the
Kingdom, and the glad tidings of salvation; and is he not therefore worthy to
live? He inviteth you to grace, Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden; and
unto glory, Come ye blessed of my Father: and therefore away with him, away
with him? With these out cries Pilate is overborne, as if clamours of the
promiscuous rout were to be taken for depositions of sworn witnesses, and he
pronounces the unjustest sentence that ever was given, that Jesus was guilty
of death. After the sentence execution immediately ensues; he is stripped stark
naked before the multitude (what would not an ingenuous man rather endure than
this shame?) his flesh is torn with whips and scourges appointed for slaves,
so cruelly, that Pilate himself, moved at so lamentable a spectacle, shows
him to the people with an ecce homo, either to move them to pity, or to
satisfy their bloodthirsty appetite. As for the insolences and indignities
offered unto him by the soldiers, they are so odious and intolerable, that I
cannot with patience relate them: and therefore I pass with our Savior to
Mount Calvarie; where four great nails were driven into the most tender and
sinewy parts of his body, wherewith after he was fastened to the cross, his
cross was set up in the midst betwixt two thieves, and the Mediator of God
and man now hangs in the middle betwixt heaven and earth. I need not amplify
upon the death of the cross, a death for the torment most grievous, most
infamous amongst men, and Deuteronomy. 21.23
accursed of God himself. Any one may conceive what a torment it must needs
be, when the whole weight of the body hangs upon the wounds in the hands and
feet. But there were four circumstances which very much aggravated his
passion: 1. The nature of his complexion; for being made of Virgins flesh, and
thereby of the purest and exactest temper, he could not but be more sensible
of excruciating torments than any other. 2. The place and time; the place
Jerusalem the Metropolis of all Judea, the time at Easter when there was a
concourse of people from all parts of Palestine, besides an infinite multitude
of strangers that came to see that great solemnity. 3. The sight of his mother
and dearest Disciple: in their sight to be put to so infamous and cruel a
death, what a corrasive must it needs be? This was the sword that pierced his
mothers heart; and how think we it affected him? his compassion was no less
grief to him than his passion. 4. The insolency of his adversaries now
flocking about his cross, and by their deriding scoffs and taunts pouring
sharpest vinegar into his wounds. To endure that which man never did nor could,
to be put to all extremiy of tortures and torments, and not to be bemoaned, nay
to be mocked at and reviled (Others he has saved, himself he cannot save:
Thou that destroyedst the Temple, and buildedst it up again in three days,
come down from the cross, and we will believe thee.) O this is an hyperbole
of misery! There are yet four considerations, which put as it were a
spiritual cross upon his material, and more tortured his soul than the
other his body.

1. His unconceivable grief for the obstinacy of the Jewish nation.

2. The apprehension of the destruction of the City and Temple, with a
desolation of the whole Country to ensue shortly after his death.

3. The guilt of the sins of the whole world.

4. The sense of the full wrath of his Father for the sins of mankind, which
he took upon himself. And now ye have the full dosis, and all the ingredients
of that bitter cup which our Savior prayed thrice that it Mat. 26.44.
might pass from him.

We have viewed the root and the branches, let us now gather some of the fruit
of the tree of the cross. Christ's passion may be considered two manner of
ways: 1. Either as a story simply, 2. Or as Gospel.


The former consideration cannot but breed in us grief and hatred; grief for
Christ his sufferings, and hatred of all that had their hand in his blood: the
latter will produce contrary affections, joy for our salvation, and love of our
Savior. For to consider and meditate upon our Saviors passion as Gospel, is
to conceive, and by a special faith to believe, that his prayers and strong
cries are intercessions for us, his obedience our merit, his sufferings our
satisfactions, that we are purged by his sweat, quit by his taking, clothed by
his stripping, healed by his stripes, justified by his accusations, absolved by
his condemnation, ransomed by his blood, and saved by his cross.

These unspeakable benefits which ye have conceived by the Word, ye are now to
receive by the Sacrament, if ye come prepared thereunto: for they who come
prepared to participate of these holy mysteries, receive with them and by them,
though not in them, the body and blood of our Lord and Savior, and thereby
shall I say they become flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone? nay rather he
becomes flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone. The spirit which raised
him quickneth them, and preserves in them the life of grace, and them to the
life of glory. Howbeit, as the sweetest meats turn into Call. l. 4. instit. c.

repentance and charity from uncleanness, worldliness, envy, malice,
ranckour, and the like corrupt affections. If a Noble man came to visit us, how
would we cleanse and perfume our houses? what care would we take to have all
the rooms swept, hung and dressed up in the best manner? Beloved Christians,
we are even now to receive and entertain the Prince of Heaven, and the Son of
God; let us therefore cleanse the inward rooms of our souls by examination of
our whole life, wash them with the water of our penitent tears, dress them up
with divine graces, which are the sweetest flowers of Paradise, perfume them
with most fragrant spices and aromaticall odours, which are our servent
prayers, zealous meditations, and elevated affectious, tuned to that high
strain of the sweet Singer of Israel, Lift ye up, ye gates, and be ye Psalm.

THE REWARD OF PATIENCE. THE LII. SERMON.
PHILIP. 2.9. Wherefore God has also highly exalted him.


Right Honorable, etc.
THe drift of the blessed Apostle in the former part of this chapter, to which
my Text cohereth, is to quench the fire-bals of contention cast among the
Philippians by proud and ambitious spirits, who preached the Gospel of truth
not in truth and sincerity, but in faction, and through emulation: ( Phil.
1.15.) Some indeed preach Christ out of envy and strife. This fire kindled
more and more by the breath of contradiction, and nourished by the ambition of
the teachers, and factious partaking of the hearers, Saint Paul seeks to lave
out, partly with his own tears, partly with Christ's blood, both which he
mingleth in a passionate exhortation at the entrance of this chapter: If there
be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels of mercies; fulfill ye my joy, be ye
like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let
nothing be done through strife or vain glory. Look not every man to his own
things, but every man also to the things of others. Let the same mind be in
you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who being in the form of God, thought it
no robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, etc. In
this context all other parts are curiously woven one in the other, only there
is a bracke at the fifth verse, which seems to have no connection at all with
the former: for the former were part of a zealous admonition to brotherly love
and christian reconciliation, add this to voluntary obedience and humiliation:
in those he persuaded them to go together as friends, in this to give place
one to the other: in those he earnestly beseeches them to be of one mind among
themselves, in this to be of the same mind with Christ Jesus. Now peace and
obedience, love and humility seem to have no great affinity one with the
other; for though their natures be not adverse, yet they are very diverse.
Howbeit, if ye look nearer to the texture of this sacred discourse, ye shall
find it all closely wrought, and that this exhortation to humility, to which my
Text belongs, has good coherence with the former, and is pertinent to the
maine scope of the Apostle; which was to reunite the severed affections, and
reconcile the different opinions of the faithful among the Philippians, that
they might all both agree in the love of the same truth, and seek that truth
in love. This his holy desire he could not effect, nor bring about his godly
purpose, before he had beat down the partition wall that was betwixt them:
which because it was erected by pride, could be no otherwise demolished than by
humility. The contentions among the people grew from emulation among the
Pastors, and that from vain glory. As sparks are kindled by ascending of the
smoke, so all quarrels and contentions by ambitious spirits: the Judge. 5.16.
divisions of Reuben are haughty thoughts of heart. A high conceit of their
own, and a low value and under rate of the gifts of others, usually keep men
from yielding one to the other upon good terms of Christian charity. Wherefore
the Apostle, like a wise Physician, applies his spiritual remedy not so much
parti laesae, to the part where the malady brake forth, as to the cause, the
vanity of the Preachers, and pride of the hearers, after this manner: Christ
humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross:
therefore they who desire to be affected and liked of him, must be like
affected to him, and not exalt themselves above others in pride, but rather
abase themselves below them in humility; not behave themselves as lords over
the faith of others, but rather demean themselves as servants for Christ's
sake; not pursue ambitiously the glory of this world, but account it the
greatest glory to partake with Christ in the infamy of the Cross. How unfit
and incongruous a thing is it in contention to preach the Gospel of peace? in
rage and choler to treat of meekness? in malice and hatred to exhort to
Christian love and reconciliation? in pride to commend humility? in vain glory
to erect the Cross of Christ? that is to deny the power of it in so declaring
it. Yet if they will needs be ambitious, if their affections are so set upon
glory and honor that nothing can take them off, let them take the readiest
course to compass their desire, which lies not in the higher way they have
chosen, by advancing themselves, but in the lower way, which Christ took by
abasing himself. For glory is of the nature of a Crocodile, which flies from
them that pursue it, and pursues them that fly it, as S. Hom. 7. ad. Philip.
(...), etc.
Chrysostom excellently declares it: Glory (says he) cannot be attained but
by eschuing it; if thou make after it, it makes away from thee; if thou
flyest from it, it follows thee; if thou desire to be glorious, be not
ambitious; for all truly honor them who affect not honor: as on the contrary
they hold a base opinion of such as are ever aspiring to honor, and that for
the most part without desert.

Two weighty reasons we have in this verse to incline all Christian minds to
obedient humility or humble obedience, a pattern of it and the reward thereof:
he humbled himse^fe so low, therefore God exalted him so high. Of the pattern
most lively drawn in the life and especially the death of our Savior, I have
said something already, and shall more hereafter; yet can never say all. As
Socrates spoke of Philosophy, that it was nothing but meditatio mortis, a
meditation upon death, we may of Divinity, that it is in a manner nothing else
but meditatio mortis Christi, a meditation on Christ's death: for the learnedest
of all the Apostles would be known of no other knowledge that he had, or much
esteemed but this, I 1 Cor. 2.2.
desire (says he) to know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified. Lib. 7.
not. hist. c. 2. Gen^ Astoma radices florum secum portat, long^ore itinere, ne
desit olfactus.
Pliny describes unto us a strange kind of people in Africa, that had no
mouths, but received all their nourishment at their nostrils (which is nothing
else but sweet smells and fragrant odours) who if they are to take any long
journey, provide themselves of great store of flowers, and sweet wood, and
aromaticall spices, lest they starve by the way. I will not warrant the
narration, because I know it is a case overruled in Aristotle's philosophy,
that smells nourish not; but the application I can make good out of the
Apostle, who calls the Gospel and the Preachers thereof odorem vitae ad
vi^am, a savor of 2 Cor. 2.16.
life unto life. Though the natural life be not, yet the spiritual is
nourished by odours and savours. And howsoever we are not in our bodies, yet in
our souls we are Astomi, and, like those people of Africa, rec^ive nourishment
from sweet trees and roots. The sweet root we are always to carry about us, is
the root of the flower of Jesse: the savoury wood we are to smell unto, is the
wood of the Cross, that is, the tree of life in the midst of our Paradise. It
is the ladder of Jacob whereby we ascend into heaven, it is the rod of Aaron
that continually buddeth in the Church, it is the Juniper tree whose shade
kills the Serpent, it is the tree which was cast into the waters of Marah and
made them sweet: no water so bitter, no affliction so brackish, to which the
Cross of Christ gives not a sweet relish.

But to proceed from the effect of Christ's passion in us, our comfort and
salvation, to the effect of it in himself, his glory and ex^ltation, expressed
in the letter of my Text, Wherefore God has also highly exalted him.

Wherefore. Although there can be no cause given of Gods will, which is the
cause of all causes; yet (as Aquinas teaches us to distinguish) there may be
ratio rei volitae, a reason of the thing willed by God: for God, according to
the counsel of his own will, sets diverse things in such an order, that the
former is the cause of the latter; yet none of them a cause, but an effect of
his will. For example, in that golden chain drawn by the Apostle, Whom he
has Romans 8.29.
predestined those he has called, whom he has called he has justified,
whom he has justified he has glorified: predestination is a cause of
vocation, vocation of justification, justification of glorification; yet all of
these depend upon Gods will, and his will upon none of them. In like manner,
God has so disposed the causes of our salvation, that Christ's incarnation and
humiliation should go before his glory and exaltation, and the one be the
meritorious cause of the other: yet neither of them is causa voluntatis divinae
exaltantis, but ratio exaltationis volitae; neither of them a cause of Gods
will exalting, but the former the reason of Christ's exaltation, as willed by
God.

God. Though Christ rose of himself, and, as himself speaks, reared up the
temple of his body after it was destroyed ratione suppositi, yet ratione
principii it is most true, God raised him up: and therefore the Apostle says
elsewhere, that he was John 2.19.
raised by the right hand of God, that is, divine, power; but because this
divine power was his own, and essential to him as God, he may be truly said
also to have raised himself.

Has highly exalted. Above the grave in his resurrection, above the earth in
his ascension, above the heaven in his session at the right hand of his Father.
In the words highly exalted there is no tautologie, but an emphasis, which is
all one as if he had said, Super omnem altitudinem exaltavit, super omnem
potestatem evexit, he exalted him above all highness, he gave him a power
above all powers, and a name above all names.

Him. It is desputed among Divines, whether this him has reference to Christ,
considered as God or man: that is to say, whether he was exalted according to
his humane nature only, or according to the divine also. Some later Expositors
of good note, and by name Mr. Perkins on the Creed, resolve that Christ was
exalted according to both natures; according to his humane, by laying down all
infirmities of man's nature, and assuming to himself all qualities of glory:
according to his divine, by the manifestation of the Godhead in the manhood,
which before seemed to lie hid. But this seems not to be so proper an
interpretation, neither can it be well conceived how that which is highest can
be said to be exalted; but Christ (according to his divine nature) is and
always was, together with the Holy Ghost, most high in the glory of God the
Father. It is true which they affirm, that the Deity more manifestly appeared
in our Savior after his resurrection than before, the rays of divine Majesty
were more conspicuous in him than before; but this comes not home to the
point. For this manifestation of the Deity in the humane nature, was no
exaltation of the divine nature, but of the humane. As when the beams of the
Sun fall upon glass, the glass is illustrated thereby, not the beam; so
the manifestation of the Deity in the humane nature of Christ, was the glory
and exaltation of the manhood, not of the Godhead. I conclude this point
therefore, according to the mind of the ancient and most of the later
Interpreters, that God exalted Christ according to that nature, which before
was abased even unto the death of the Cross: and that was apparently his
humane. For according to his divine, as he could not be humbled by any, so
neither be exalted: as he could not die, so neither be raised from death.

Having thus parced the words, it remains that we make construction of the
whole; which confirms to us a principal article of our faith, and gives us
thus much to understand concerning the present estate of our Lord and Savior,
That because being in the form of God, clothed with majesty and honor, adored
by Cherubins, Seraphins, Archangels and Angels, he dis-robed himself of his
glorious attire, and put upon him the habit and form of a servant, and in it,
to satisfy for the sins of the whole world, endured all indignities,
disgraces, vexations, derisions, tortures and torments, and for the close of
all death it self, yea that cruel, infamous and accursed death of the Cross:
therefore God even his Father, to whom he thus far obeyed, and most humbly
submitted himself, has accordingly exalted him, raising him from the dead,
carrying him up in triumph into heaven, setting him in a throne of Jasper at
his right hand, investing him with robes of majesty and glory, conferring upon
him all power and authority, and giving him a name above all names, and a style
above all earthly styles, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, giving charge to all
creatures of what rank or degree soever in heaven, earth, or under the earth,
to honor him as their King and God, in such sort that they never speak or
think of him without bowing the knee, and doing him the greatest reverence and
religious respect that is possibly to be expressed.

In this high mystery of our faith five specialties are remarkable: 1 The
cause, Wherefore. 2 The person advancing, God. 3 The advancement it self,
exalted. 4 The manner, highly. 5 The person advanced, him. Begin we with the
cause.


Wherefore. That which was elsewhere spoken by our Savior, Luke 14.11.
He that humbles himself shall be exalted, is here spoken of our Savior,
he humbled himself to suffer a most accursed death, therefore God highly
exalted him to a most blessed and glorious life. We are too well conceited of
our selves, and gather too much from Gods love and gracious promises to us, if
we expect that he should bring us by a nearer way and shorter cut to celestial
glory, than he did his only begotten Son; who came not easily by his crown,
but bought it dearly with a price, not which he gave, but rather for which he
was given himself. His conquest over death and hell, and the spoils taken
from them, were not Salmacida spolia, sine sanguine and sudore, spoils got
without sweat or bloodshed; for he sweat, and he bled; nay he sweat blood in
his striving and struggling for them. Wherefore if God humble us by any
grievous visitation, if by sickness, poverty, disgrace, or captivity we are
brought low in the world, let us not be too much dejected therewith; we are
not fallen, nor can fall so low as our Savior descended of himself
immediately before his glorious exaltation. The lower a former wave carries
down the ship, the higher the later bears it up: the farther back the arrow
is drawn, the farther forward it flies. Our affections as our actions are
altogether preposterous and wrong: in the height of prosperity we are usually
without fear, in the depth of misery without hope. Whereas if we weighed all
things in an equal balance, and guided our judgment, not by sight, but by
faith; not by present probabilities, but by antecedent certainties: we should
find no place more dangerous to build our confidence upon, than the ridge of
prosperity: no ground surer to cast the anchor of our hope upon, than the
bottom of misery. How suddenly was Herod, who heard himself called a god and
not a man, deprived of his kingdom and life by worms and no men? whereas
David, who reputed himself a worm and no man, was made a King over men. Moses
was taken from feeding sheep, to feed the people of God: but on the contrary,
Nebuchadnezzar from feeding innumerable flocks of people, shall I say to feed
sheep? nay to be fed as a sheep, and graze among the beasts of the field. O
what a sudden change was here made in the state of this mighty Monarch? How was
he that gloried in his building of great Babel brought to Babel, that is,
confusion? he that before dropped with sweet ointment, feasted all his senses
with the pleasures of a King, has the dew of heaven for his ointment, the
flowery earth for his carpets, the weeds for his sallets, the lowing of beasts
for his music, and the sky for his star chamber. How great a fall also had
the pride of Antiochus, who riding furiously in his chariot against Jerusalem,
was thrown out of it on the ground, and with the fall so bruised his members,
that his flesh rotted and bred worms in great abundance? 2 Mac. 9.8, 9.
He that a little before thought that he might command the waves of the sea
(so proud was he beyond the condition of man) and weigh the high mountains in
a balance, was now cast on the ground, and carried in an horse-litter,
declaring unto all the manifest power of God. So that the worms came out of
the bowels of this wicked man in great abundance; and while he was yet alive
his flesh fell off with pain and torments, and all his army was grieved with
the stench. The Xen. Cyr. paed l. 3. (...), etc.
King of Armenia, who had been formerly tributary to Cyrus, understanding that
that puissant Prince was engaged in a dangerous war with Croesus, works
upon this advantage, rebels against Cyrus, and makes himself an absolute
Prince. But within a few days Cyrus having got the conquest of Croesus, turns
his forces against this rebel, takes him, his wife and children prisoners;
yet upon his submission, above his hope and expectation, both gives him his
life and his crown, and puts him in a better state than ever he was.
Whereupon that proud captivated, and humble restored Prince, acknowledging his
treachery and folly, said, O how does the wisdom of heaven over-shadow the
providence of mortal men? how little are we aware of what may betide us? how
glassy are our scepters? how brittle our estate? The other day when I made full
account to have made my self a free absolute Monarch, I lost both liberty and
crown; and this day when I gave my self for gone, and looked every hour to
have had my head struck off, I have gained both pardon, liberty, and my crown
better settled than ever before. Such examples are so frequent, not only in
the sacred Annals of the Church, but also in profane stories, that a
Philosopher being asked what God did in the world, answered, (...), Hesiod. l.
1. (...), etc.
he abaseth noble things, and ennobleth base; he turns Scepters into
Mattockes, and Mattocks into Scepters; he makes hovels of palaces, and
palaces of hovels; pulls down high things, and raises up low: agreeably to
the words of the Prophet Esaias, Esa. 40.4.
Every valley shall be exalted, and every hill brought low.

Whence notwithstanding we are not to infer. That God is more the God of the
vales than of the hills, or that he better esteems the low cottage of the
beggar, than the high turrets of Princes: he takes no pleasure in the fall of
any, much less of his dear children. It is not their broken estate, but their
contrite heart; not their poverty in goods, but in spirit; not their lowness
of condition, but their lowliness of mind, which he approves and rewards,
giving honor to that virtue which ascribes all honor to him. The Apostle
says not, because Christ was humbled and put to so cruel and shameful a
death, therefore God highly exalted him; but because he humbled himself.
Which reason of the Apostle may be confirmed, or at least illustrated by other
paralle'd texts of Scripture: Pro. 29 23.
The pride of a man shall bring him low, but the humble spirit shall enjoy
glory. Pro. 18.12.
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, but before glory goes
lowliness. Job 22.29.
When others are cast down, thou shall say, I am lifted up, and God shall save
the humble: and, Luke 1.52.
He has put down the mighty from their seat, and has exalted the lowly and
meek. Yea to honor and exalt them he humbles himself, and Esa. 57 15.
comes down to dwell with them: for thus says the high and lofty One, that
inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place:
with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of
the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. When a Prince rides
in progress how much are they graced at whose house he lies but for a night?
how far greater honor is done to the humble soul, with whom God lodges not
for a night or abides for a few days, but continually dwells? what can
there be wanting where God is, in whom are all things? how will he furnish his
house? how will he set forth his rooms? how gloriously will he beautify and
deck his closet and cabinet? I know not how God can raise the dwelling of the
humble soul higher, who by his dwelling in it has made it equal to the
highest heaven: I dwell, says he, in the high and holy place, with him also
that is of a contrite and humble spirit. There is no more difference between
the seat of the blessed above the heavens, and the caves of the poorest
servants of God under the earth, than between two royal palaces, the one
higher the other lower built, but both equally honored with the Court lying at
them. In the weighing of gold the light Horat. car. l. 1 Attollunt vacuum plus
nimio verticem.
pieces rise up, but the weighty bear down the scale; and surely they are but
light who are lifted up in a self-conceit, but they who have true worth and
weight in them are depressed in themselves, and bear down toward the earth.
Look we to the wisest of all the Philosophers, he was the modestest; for his
profession was, Hoc scio, quod nihil scio; This I know, that I know nothing.
Look we to the learnedest of all the Greek Fathers, Origin, he was the most
ingenuous; for his confession was, Ignorantiam meam non ignoro, I am not
ignorant of mine own ignorance. Look we to the most judicious and
industrious of all the Latin, Saint Aug. epist. ad Hieron.
Austine, he was the humblest; for even in his heat of contention with Jerome
he acknowledges him his better, Hieronymus Presbyter Augustino Episcopo major
est, though the dignity of a Bishop exceed that of a Priest, yet Priest Jerome
is a better or a greater man than Bishop Austine. Look we to the best of
Kings, David, he was the freest from pride; Psalm. 131.1, 2
Lord, says he, I am not high-minded, I have no proud looks, I do not
exercise my self in great matters, or in things too high for me: surely I
have behaved and quieted my self as a child that is weaned of his mother, my
soul is even as a weaned child. Look we to the noblest of all the Theodosius.
Roman Emperors, his Motto was, Malo membrum esse Ecclesiae quam caput
Imperii; I account it a greater honor to be a member of the Church than the
head of the Empire. Look we to him that was not inferior to the chief
Apostles, surnamed Paulus (as some of the Ancient guess) quasi paululus,
because he was least in his own eyes, not worthy to be called an Apostle, as
himself freely 1 Cor. 15.9 Ephesians. 3.8.
confesses. Look we to the mirror of all perfection, Christ Jesus, in whom
are all the treasures of wisdom and grace, he sets out humility as his
chiefest jewel; Mat. 11.29.
Learn of me, says he, that I am meek and humble in heart. The rain falls
from the hills, and settleth in the vales; and Gods blessings in like manner if
they fall upon the high-minded and proud, yet they stay not with them, but
pass and slide from them down to the meek and humble, where he commands
them to rest. The reason is evident why the humblest men are best; for grace
alone makes good, and a greater measure thereof better: now Jam. 4.6.
God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble; and to the more
humble the more grace, because they more desire it, and are more capable
thereof. For the more empty the vessel is, the more liquor it receives; in
like manner the more empty we are in our own conceits, the more heavenly grace
God Mat. 11.25.
infuseth into us. To him therefore let our souls continually gasp as a
thirsty land, let us pray to him for humility that we may have grace, and more
grace that we may be continually more humble.

Lord, who have taught us that because thy Son our Savior being in the form
of God humbled himself, and in his humility became obedient, and in his
obedience suffered death, even the most ignominious, painful, and accursed
death of the cross; thou have exalted him highly above the grave in his
resurrection, the earth in his ascension, above the stars of heaven in his
session: establish our faith in his estate both of humiliation and exaltation,
and grant that his humility may be our instruction, his obedience our rule, his
passion our satisfaction, his resurrection our justification, his ascension our
improvement of sanctification, and his session at thy right hand our
glorification.

We are come to keep holy the solemnest feast the Church ever appointed, to
recount thankfully the greatest benefit mankind ever received, to celebrate
joyfully the happiest day time ever brought forth: and if the rising of the sun
upon the earth make a natural day in the Calendar of the world, shall not much
more the rising of the Sun of righteousness out of the grave with his glorious
beams, describe a festival day in the Calendar of the Church? If the rest of
God from the works of creation was a just cause of sanctifying a perpetual
Sabbath to the memory thereof; may not the rest of our Lord from the works of
redemption, more painful to him, more beneficial to us, challenge the like
prerogative of a day to be hallowed and consecrated unto it? shall we not keep
it as a Sabbath on earth, which has procured for us an everlasting Sabbath in
heaven? The holy Apostles, and their Successors, who followed the true light of
the world so near that they could not miss their way, thought it so meet and
requisite, that upon this ground they changed the seventh day from the
creation, appointed by God himself for a Ignat. epist. ad Magnes. (...).

yet the same proportion of time continues which was before, because in a

added by him, which was the Prince of the world to come; we are bound to
account the sanctification of one day in seven, a duty which Gods immutable
decree does exact for ever.
Sabbath, and fixed the Christian Sabbath upon the first day of the week, to
eternize the memory of our Lords resurrection. This day is the first borne of
the Church feasts, the Prototypon and samplar Lords day, if I may so speak,
from whence all the other throughout the year were drawn as patterns: this
is as the Sun it self, they are as the Parelii the Philosophers speak of,
images and representations of that glorious light in bright clouds, like so
many glasses set about the body thereof. With what solemnity then the highest
Christian feast is to be celebrated, with what religion the christian Sabbath
of sabbaths is to be kept, with what affection the accomplishment of our
redemption, the glorification of our bodies, the consummation of our happiness
the triumph of our Lord over death and hell, and ours in him and for him is to
be recounted, with what preparation and holy reverence the Sacrament of our
Lords body and blood, which seals unto us these inestimable benefits, is to be
received; with that solemnity, that religion, that affection, that preparation,
that elevation of our minds we are to offer this morning sacrifice. Wherefore I
must entreat you to endeavor to raise your thoughts and affections above their
ordinary level, that they fall not short of this high day, which as it
represents the raising and exaltation of the worlds Redeemer, so it self is
raised and exalted above all other Christian feasts. Were our devotion key
cold, and quite dead, yet me thinks that the raising of our Lord from the
dead should revive it, and put new life and heat into it, as it drew the bodies
of many Saints out of the graves to accompany our Lord into the holy City.
After the Sun had bin in the eclipse for three hours, when the fountain of
light began again to be opened, and the beams like streams run as before,
how lightsome on the sudden was the world? how beautiful, being as it were new
gilt with those precious rays? how joyful and cheerful were the countenances
of all men? The Sun of righteousness had been in a total eclipse, not for
three hours, but three whole days and nights, and then there was nothing but
darkness of sor^ow over the face of the whole Church; but now he appears in
greater glory than ever before; now he shines in his full strength. What joy
must this needs be to all that before sat in darkness and in the shadow of
death? In the deadest time of the year we celebrated joyfully the birth of our
Lord out of the womb of the Virgin, and shall we not this Spring as much
rejoice at his second birth, and springing out of the womb of the earth? Then
he was borne in humility, and swadled in clouts, now he is borne in majesty,
and clothed with robes of glory; then he was borne to obey, now to rule; then
to dye, now to live for ever; then to be nailed on the cross at the right hand
of a thief, now to be settled on a throne at the right hand of his Father.

As Cooks serve in sweet meats with sour sawces, Musicians in their songs
insert discords, to give relish as it were to their concords, and Cic. de
orat. l. 3. Habeat summa illa laus umbram and recessum, ut id quod illuminatum
est magis extare atque eminere videatur.
Rhetoricians set off their figures by solaecismes or plain sentences: in like
manner the Apostle, to extol our Saviors exaltation the higher, depresseth
his humiliation the lower; he expresses his passion in the darkest colors, to
make the glory of his resurrection appear the brighter, (...), he emptied
himself, word for word, made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the
form of a servant, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself,
and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross. Wherefore God
also (...), highly exalted him, Superexaltavit: as if ye would say, he highly
raised him on high. The stroke is doubled upon the nail to drive it in
further; the beam is reflected to give more light and heat; the word is
repeated for more significancy and efficacy: as, Visitando visitabo, and
desiderando desideravi, and benedicendo benedicam, and gavisi sunt gaudio
magno; a^, in Exodus 32.34.
visiting I will visit, that is, I will most surely visit: and I have Luke
22.15.
desired with desire, that is, I have vehemently desired to eat this Passover:
and the wise men Mat. 2.10.
rejoiced with joy to see the star, that is, they exceedingly rejoiced: and
in Genesis 12.2, 3.
blessing will I bless thee, says God to Abraham, that is, I will
wonderfully, I will extraordinarily bless thee with store of blessings; so
here superexaltavit, he highly raised on high signifies he raised him by many
degrees, he exalted him to the highest honor he was capable of: so highly,
that all creatures whatsoever are far below him. In these two words, highly
exalted, are wound up three Articles of our Christian Belief immediately
following one the other in the Apostles Creed, 1. Resurrection, 2. Ascension,
3. Session at the right hand of God.
When he was raised from the dead, he was exalted; but when he ascended, and
took his place at the right hand of God above all thrones, dominions,
principalities, and powers, he was highly exalted. As there are three descents
in his humiliation; his death, his going down to Hell, his lying in the grave
three days and three nights: so there are three ascents in his exaltation
correspondent unto them; to the first degree of his humiliation, his death,
answers the first degree of his exaltation, his resurrection: to the second,
his descent into hell, his ascension into heaven: to the third, his lying three
days and three nights in the grave, which was the lowest degree of his
humiliation, the highest degree of his exaltation, his sitting at the right
hand of God. The sweet flower of Jesse, which was set at his death, and thrust
deep into the ground at his burial, is now sprung up from the earth in his
resurrection, opens his leaves, and sends forth a savor of life unto life to
all that by faith smell unto it.

But to keep to the words of my Text; the parts whereof resemble insecta
animalia, those creeping things, which if you cut them asunder, will join
again: therefore is as the communis terminus to them all, because the Son of
God was so far humbled, it was fit he should be exalted accordingly; because
he humbled himself, therefore God exalted him; because he humbled himself so
low, God exalted him so high: where humility goes before, there is a just cause
of exaltation; and where there is a cause, God will exalt; and where God
exalts, he exalts highly.

Wherefore. It is hotly argued between the reformed Divines and Papists, Utrum
Christus sibi meruerit; Whether Christ merited any thing for himself, or only
for us. The Romanists stand for the first, the Protestants for the second
opinion. I see no cause why this controversy should not be composed: for
questionless Christ's humiliation deserved an exaltation, neither can we
attribute too much glory to our Redeemer. Albeit therefore as Mediator he
merited for us, yet as man he might also merit for himself: and the word
Quaproptet, Wherefore, seems rather to imply the meritorious cause of his
exaltation, than a consequence only of the hypostaticall union. Where God
exalts, there is always some cause; he advanced not his Son without merit.
Whose example, if they (in whose gifts the greatest preferments are) did
always follow, the garlands of honors should not be taken from them that
win the race, and given to standers by. Cato was in the right, who said, he
had rather that men should ask why has Cato no statue or monument, rather
than why should he have a monument? And surely it is a greater honor, that men
should enquire why such a man of worth is not preferred, than why is such a man
of no worth preferred; yet as in nature, so in states, the heaviest bodies will
ascend ad supplendum vacuum, to fill up a vacuity. Worthless men, like Apes
and Monkies, will not be quiet till they have got to the top of the house, and
when they are there, what do they but make mouths and faces at passengers, or
break glasses, or play other ridiculous feats? The old thorowfaire to the
Temple of honor among the Romans, was by the Temple of virtue; but now it is
said men have found a nearer way through the postern gate of Juno Moneta. The
ancient Philosophers did but dream of a golden age, but we see it: Aurea nunc
vere sunt secula, plurimus auro
Venit honos, auro conciliatur amor.
This may be well esteemed the golden age, in which gold is in greatest esteem.
Gold supplies all defects, and answers to all things: A Exodus 32.6.
Calfe shall be worshipped with divine honor, if he be of gold. But the best
is, they that rise like Jonas gourd in a night, are blasted in an hour; and as
they are raised no man knows why, so they fall no man knows how. It is not
possible that a high and great building should stand without a foundation. Now
if we will believe Saint Austine, the foundation of honor is worth, and this
must be laid deep in the ground of humility.

He humbled himself; therefore God highly exalted him. If Christ, who humbled
and abased himself so low, be now so highly exalted above all principalities,
and powers, and thrones, and dominions, there is no cause then why any of Gods
children humbled under his hand, how low soever they are brought, should
despair of rising again. Look they upward or downward, they may fasten the
anchor of their hope: beneath them our Savior was, who now is above the
heavens. Are they spoiled of their goods? he was stripped stark naked. Have
they left a great estate, he left a Kingdom in Heaven. Are they falsely
accused? he was condemned of blasphemy. Are they railed at? he was spit upon.
Are they pricked with griefs? he was crowned with thorns. Do they lie hard?
he hung upon the cross. Do they sigh for their grievous afflictions? he gave
up the ghost in torments. Are they forsaken of their friends? he was for a time
of his Father: ( My Mat. 27.46.
God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?) Have they things laid to their
charge they never knew? he was charged with the sins of the whole world, which
pressed him down to the earth, nay yet lower, to the grave; and yet behold he
now sits at the right hand of God, and he who was abased beneath the lowest
creatures, is advanced above all, and all bow unto him. And therefore as the
oak Ab ipso ducit opes animumque ferro. takes heart as it were, and grows
by the stroke of the axe; and as Juel. in Apol. Eccles. Angl.
Anteus the Giant recovered his strength by his fall on the ground: so should
they take comfort from their afflictions, and gather arguments of their future
exaltation from their present fall and humiliation. They are fallen and
humbled, therefore in case to be raised; there is a why and a wherefore they
should be exalted: they are in a good way to honor, wherein they may see our
Saviors footsteps before them. God wounds and heals, he kills and
reviveth, he lets his children down to the gates of hell to terrefie them
for their sins, and make them claspe about him, and lay faster hold on his
promises; for he brings them back again. The solemnity used at the
inauguration of the Emperor of the Tartars somewhat resembles Gods dealing
with his children and the heirs of the crown of heaven. De rep. l. 1. c. 8.
Rex de sublimi solio demovetur, and vilissimae tabulae superpositus humi
constituitur; ad quem Pontifex orationem convertens, Inspice coelum inquit, and
Deum praepotentem universitatis regem intuere and agnosce: si just
imperaveris, omnia ex animi tui sententia consequeris, sin muneris officiique
tui obliviscaris, praeceps ex alto ac sublimi loco dejectus, regali potestate
and bonis omnibus spoliabere, ut ne tabula quidem haec cui insideas tibi
relinquatur.
Bodin thus relates it: When the Nobles and Peers are assembled, the Prince
to be crowned is taken out of a chair of estate, and set upon a low stool or
planke on the ground: the Priest who is to sacre him uses these words, Look
up to heaven and acknowledge the sovereign Commander of the whole world, and
know that if thou rule justly, he will establish thy Throne under thee, and
settle the crown upon thee: but if thou cast away all fear of him, and car^
of the peoples safety and welfare, he will pull thee down from thy high
Throne, and lay thee on the ground, take all from thee that he has given thee,
and leave thee not so much as this sorry board thou sit upon. After which
words he is invested with Princely robes, carried up in great state, set in
his Imperial Throne, crowned and proclaimed Emperor: in like manner, God
before he advances his dearest children, and puts the Crown of glory upon
their heads, sets them as it were upon a low planke, in some mean or
deplorate condition upon earth, that they may humble themselves under that
mighty hand of his, which Psa. 113.6, 7.
raises the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the dounghill,
that he may set them even with the Princes of his people. Since then God raises
the poor from the dounghill to tread upon cloth of estate, and sit in the
Throne of Princes, since he advances men of smallest means to great estates,
and casting the bright beams of his favor upon the lowest and obscurest
hovells and cottages, makes them illustrious and glorious, why should any of
Gods children by any extremity whatsoever be driven to resign their estate in
his promises? to close their own eyes before they are dead? and yield up their
last breath with sighs of grief and groans of despair? They lie but in the
dust, God raises from the dounghill, as he did Job; nay from the dungeon, as
he did Daniel and Jeremy; nay yet lower, from the grave, as he did Lazarus; nay
yet lower, from the neathermost hell, as he did our Savior. Kings have long
hands, An nescis longas regibus esse manus? and God has outstretched arms:
there is no place so high which they cannot reach, and from thence pluck down
the proud: no depth so low, which they cannot sound, and from thence draw up
the humble. The celestial bodies distill their influence down to the lowest
vales, which stays not all there, but some part of it is conveyed yet
lower, by pores and secret passages, even to the bosom and bowels of the
earth, to the generation and perfection of the metalls and mineralls there: and
shall we not think that the beams of Gods favor can carry down the sweetest
influences of his graces into the deepest dungeon of misery, and darkest
chambers of death? If art can make of ashes and trash pure and shining glass,
if nature produces gold of the basest of all the elements earth, and precious
stones of excrementitious moisture; what marvel is it, that God should make
scepters of mattockes, cedars of shrubs, and of those that are accounted the
offscouring of all things stars of heaven? No Christian doubts of his
power: all the question that can be made, is of his will; and thereof we can
make no question that hear his gracious promise, that he that Luke 14.11.
humbles himself shall be exalted. Why then are not all that are humbled
exalted? A short answer may be, because they humble not themselves as Christ
here did, neither are truly humbled. All that are thrown down presently do
not yield; sickness may bring the body low, and calamity the estate lower, and
yet the mind be high and haughty: and that de facto they are not humble, who
complain that they are not raised, their repining at others preferment, and
their staying behind them makes it manifest. For nothing is so repugnant to
humility as ambition: (ambition is of the Eagle and Falcons brood, it soareth
aloft; but humility is e genere reptilium, of the nature of worms that creep
on the ground.) He whom humility truly informs how small his deserts, how
great his defects are, how vain the pompes of this world, how secure a quiet
and retired life, cannot inordinately desire preferment, which in his judgment
is not preferment, since he prefers a lower estate above it, as more suitable
to the lowliness of his mind. With this two-forked ram therefore we may push
down all the forts which discontented spirits raise against the divine
providence: if they are truly humble, they desire not to be exalted; if they
are not humble, they deserve not.

Howbeit, the cunning painter of vices in the tables of men's hearts sets
such a fair color upon ambition, that he sometimes deceives humble
Christians, and ere they are aware, makes them enamoured with it. The color
is the advancement of Gods glory by their preferment: for these or the like
thoughts he suggesteth, God has bestowed upon you some eminent gifts or
graces, this to deny were not humility, but unthankfulness; to bury these in
oblivion and obscurity, cannot but be prejudicial to his glory: therefore since
his commandment is, Mat. 5.16.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your works, and
glorify your Father which is in heaven, it is your part to endeavor to take
your candle from under the bushel which covers it, and set it on a high
candlestick, that is, some eminent place of dignity in Church or
Commonwealth, that it may give light to the whole house of God. But latet
anguis in herba, there lies a foul affection under this fair pretense. For
such as are overtaken with this temptation of Satan, seek not their own
advancement for Gods glory, but Gods glory (if so at all they seek it) for
their own advancement: they pray that the Sun may clearly show forth his
beams, but it is, that their gifts, which are but as moates in comparison, may
be seen and glissen in his rays. They are like false friends and cunning
spokesmen, they bear the world in hand that they woo for God, but they speak
for themselves. Otherwise it would be indifferent to them, if any other of as
good or better parts than themselves, should be preferred to those dignities
they aspire unto: and howsoever they could not but rest satisfied with the
answer of God himself, I have Joh. 12.28.
glorified my name, and will glorify it. God has a greater care of his glory
than they can have: neither is there one only way by which he sets forth his
glory; for the ways of the Lord are mercy and justice. All that are exalted
are not exalted in mercy, some are exalted in justice, as malefactors are
carried up to a high scaffold for more exemplary punishment. God bestows no
gifts in vain, he will make the best benefit and advantage for his glory,
fear they it not: he knows the value of all the jewels of his grace, and he
will sort and rank them where they may most deck and adorn his Spouse, take
they no care for it. As for their condition, what does their obscurity and
privacy disparage them? their Father who sees their good parts in secret will
reward them openly.

I foresee what may be further objected against the doctrine delivered; if he
that humbles himself shall be exalted, how comes it to pass, that none are
usually more vilified and dis-esteemed, than they who make themselves cheap?
Tanti eris, quanti te feceris, a man is accounted of according to that he
valueth himself: his gifts of mind and body are never thought worth more than
himself priseth them at. Who get sooner into the highest places of preferment,
than those who are still climbing? Does not pride and ambition exalt many? or
at least are not those that are in high places high minded? and consequently,
neither are the humble exalted, nor those that are exalted humble? I answer
that the proud are often exalted in this world, yet not by God; but either by
the world, who like a cunning wrestler, lifts up his adversary above ground
to give him the greater fall: or by the Devil, who does his best by his
instruments to set them in high places, that through giddiness they may fall
and ruin themselves: Or if it be by God, it is in justice, not in mercy, as
soldiers condemned to the strapado, are drawn up to the highest round, that
they may be more tortured in their fall. My collection out of this Text
stands yet firm, None are exalted by God in mercy, especially to a Crown in
heaven, of which the Apostle here speaks, but such as are dejected in
themselves, and bear a low sail in their minds. For God acknowledges none
for his but those that deny themselves; he is pleased with none, but those that
are displeased with themselves: he accounts none worthy of honor, but those
that account themselves unworthy.

Now the reason why God exalts the humble is apparent; for he has promised,
Honorantes me honorabo; Them that 1 Samuel 2.30.
honor me, I will honor: and none more honors God than the humble, who
ascribes nothing to himself but all to God. If Princes most willingly advance
those to high places under them, who they are persuaded will most honor them,
and do them best service in their offices; whom then should God rather raise
than the humble, who the more they are exalted, the more they extol him? the
more glorious they are, the more they glorify him? the more light of honor
they receive, the more they reflect back? Besides, to whom is honor more due
than to those who fly it? who fitter to govern than they who know best what
it is to obey? who are like to be freer from oppressing and depressing others,
than they who in the height of their fortune most deject their minds? Those
virtues which are most attractive, and are aptest to win our love and
affection, are all either parts or adjuncts of humility. None so religious as
the humble, who by so much has a higher conceit of God by how much he has the
lower of himself. None so thankful as he, who acknowledges all Gods
blessings undue. None so patient as he, who acknowledges all the
chastisements that are inflicted upon him most due unto him. None so obedient
as he, who utterly denies himself, and brings every thought in subjection
to Gods Word. None so fervent in prayer as he, who is most sensible of his
wants. None so penitent as he, who abhors himself for his sins, and
repents in dust and ashes. None so merciful as he, who accounts himself
the greatest offender. None so free in contribution to others as he, who
makes reckoning that any better deserves Gods blessings than himself. These
graces and beautiful ornaments of the humble soul kindle an affection in God
himself, and shall they not inflame our love to this virtue? Look we not to
the acts of it, which seem vile and base, but to the effects, which are
glorious and honorable: It is called Mat. 5.3.
poverty in spirit, yet it enricheth the soul; it is in name and nature
lowliness, yet it exalts; it is vile in the eyes of the world, but precious
in Gods esteem. The grass upon the house top withers, and the July-flowers
on the wall soon lose their sent; but the Violets and other flowers that grow
near to the ground smell sweeter, and last longer. What do the twelve
precious stones shining in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem signify,
but so many Christian virtues laid in the ground of humility? Neither let it
trouble any, that men who put not themselves forth, though they are of
extraordinary parts, are often forgotten in states, and neglected by those who
should tabulas been pictas collocare in bono lumine, bring them into the light:
for such men are most fitly compared to the statues of Brutus and Cassius, that
were not brought forth nor carried with the rest in the funerals of Junia, of
whom the wise Historian says, Eo ipso praefulgebant quod non visebantur. If
true honor, as all wise men judge, consist not in pomp and retinue, or lands,
or possessions, or houses, plate, or jewels, but in the judgment and
estimation of virtue; doubtless they have more true honor done unto them,
whom the best reverence in their minds for their eminent gifts and graces, how
obscure soever their condition and place be, than those of less or no worth,
to whose office and place they give the cap and knee. When the Ass that
carried the Idol of Isis upon his back, saw all the people fall down before
the goddess, he lift up his head, and kicked up his heels, and never left
braying, as being proud of so great honor done unto him: which folly of the
silly beast the people checked in such sort for the present, that it grew
afterward for a Proverb, Non tibi, sed Eras. chil.
Isidi; Alas, stupid beast, the worship is not performed to thee, but to the
image which thou bear. I know ye prevent me in the application; and
therefore I press these things no further: only give me leave to offer to
them, who are out-stripped by men of inferior quality in their way of
preferment, these considerations following. That the coal which is healed in
the ashes lives, when that which is raked out and blown soon dies: the
jewel in the casket is safe and most resplendent, when that which is taken out
and worn is soyled or lost. Public offices and eminent places in Church and
Commonwealth expose those that hold them to the view of all; as their good
parts are taken notice of, so their bad cannot be concealed. Now if any man or
woman otherwise fair or beautiful, should yet have some one foul deformity
in their face, were it a cut, or scarre, or boil, or botch, or the like, would
they desire much to be seen? would they not either keep in, or by a mask or
veil cover this imperfection? Beloved Christians, there is none that has not
some or other greater imperfection in his mind, than any deformity in the body
can be. Privacie, and places of small or mean employment cast a veil over
those infirmities and imperfections, in such sort that none or very few espy
them; public callings, and places of great action discover them to the view of
all. In which consideration if we compare one with the other, the setting
forth of their vices and imperfections, with the blazing of their virtues and
good parts, if they have any; I am persuaded that never any proud and
worthless, or vainglorious, or ambitious person obtained their end, the
constant applause and praise of men. For though for a time they are upon the
tongue of all, and entertained with greatest acclamations before their blind
sides and manifold imperfections are known; yet after veritas temporis filia
has brought in her evidence against them, their acclamations are turned into
exclamations against them, and their name putrefieth even whilst yet they are
alive. If a Soldier that has done good service in a country where there were
no good coin, but brass or lead pieces made current by the Princes command
for the present necessity, should have this condition offered him, that if he
would be content with so much of his pay as might defray his necessary charge,
and forbear the rest till he returned to his own country, he should
receive so much in quantity in the purest gold as he might there in basest
coin; could he except against it? nay should he not be very unwise to refuse
so good an offer? The like condition is propounded by God unto them that daily
fight his battles; for the good service they do, and the losses, wounds,
infamy, or disgrace they suffer, glory and honor is due unto them, at least by
promise: the glory of this world is of less value in comparison of celestial,
than the basest coin in comparison of the purest gold; yet the country
wherein they serve (this earth) affords no better: but if they forbear till
they return to their own home in heaven, there they shall receive gold for
copper, pearl for glass, a massy crown of gold for a gilt paper coronet,
glory from God and his Angels for glory from men.

Lastly, the words of the Apostle Saint Peter are very remarkable to this
purpose, 1 Pet. 5.6.
Humble your selves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due
time: they who are not yet may be exalted in due time, if the due time fall by
their life time, no man shall be able to cross them in their advancement, nor
defeat them of it: if not, they cannot commence any suit of unkindnesse against
our gracious God for not exalting them sooner than he did the greatest
instruments of his glory, the Prophets and Apostles, nay and his only begotten
Son, who became obedient unto death before he exalted him. The belssed Apostle
S. Paul expected not his garland before he had 2 Timothy 4.8. I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith, therefore is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness.
run his race; neither did any of the Roman Captains think it long to stay for
their donatives till the day of triumph, when they received a Crown from the
Emperor, not below in the streets, but above in the Capitol. Our day of
triumph is the day of judgment, when we are to receive a crown of
righteousness, not on earth, but in heaven. In the mean while, if any
preferments or honors be cast upon us, let us not esteem them as our hire,
but take them only as earnests: but if we lead our life ingloriously, and
breath out our last breath in silence and obscurity, let this be our solace,
that as there can be no darkness where the sun shines, so neither is there
any place to be accounted private or inglorious where God and his Angels are
present. There needs no other proof where God is an eyewitness of our
labors and performance, no applauders where his Angels are spectators. I fill
up this border therefore with a flower taken from Saint Cyp. l. 4. ep. 5. Nec
minor est martyrii gloria non public and inter multos periisse, cum pereundi
causa sit propter Christum: perire sufficit ad testimonium martyrii testis ille
qui martyrs probat and coronat. Et ib. Solus non est cui Christus in fuga
comes est, solus non est qui templum Dei servat, ubicunque fuerit sine Deo non
est.
Cyprians samplar. This Martyr understanding of the discontent taken by some
Martyrs in his days, that the Proconsull had so ordered that they should be
put to death privately, and thereby made Martyrs sine martyribus, witnesses
deposing for the faith of Christ without any to testify their constancy, or
take example by their patience; thus he quieteth their minds: The glory of
your martyrdom, says he, is nothing eclipsed by the privacy of your
suffering, so the cause be for the faith of Christ it will be abundantly
sufficient proof of your patience, and assurance to you of your reward, that
he for whom you suffer sees what you suffer, and that he is your witness
who will be your rewarder and crowner, even God himself. And so I fall upon
the next circumstance, the person exalting. Wherefore

God highly exalted him. He humbled himself, but God exalted him. The fruit
which we are to gather from this branch of my text is like to the former; yet
there is a difference between them: the former qualified and pacified the
mind from murmuring and discontent at our present estate and calling, how low
and mean soever it were; this keeps it from aspiring thoughts, Mat. 23.12.
and unwarrantable projects and attempts for the raising of our fortunes, Luke
14.11.
and advancing our estate. Before the burden of our song was, He that humbles
himself shall be exalted; but now it is, He that exalts himself shall be
brought low. The latter is as true as the former, both were uttered with one
breath by our Savior. As not he that commends himself is to be commended,
so neither is he that exalts himself to be approved, but he whom God
exalts. If any might ever have magnified and exalted himself, certainly our
Lord and Savior might best, who both spoke as never man spoke, and did as
never man did, and suffered what never man did or could suffer; yet he
himself professes, Joh. 8.14.
If I honor my self mine honor is nothing, it is my Father that honors
me. He honors and exalts himself who either vainegloriously sets
forth his own wares, blazoneth his own arms, and is the trumpet of his own
praises: or he who ambitiously desires such dignities and preferments whereof
he is unworthy, or uses indirect means to compass those places whereof he
might otherwise be worthy and capable. This vicious affection is discried in
Joh. 3.9.

and Ministers, who are both in Scripture styled Angels, are not suddenly to
leap or hastily to climb up to places of preferment, but ascend by degrees
when God sets a ladder for them? Thistle-down, and feathers, and vapors,

Gregory complain of them that chose him Bishop of Rome? What have ye done my
friends? ye have laid such a burden upon me that presses me down to the earth,
in such sort that I cannot lift up my mind to the contemplation of the things
that are above. Public charges, and eminent places, besides the great troubles
they bring with them, expose them that hold them to great perils and dangers:
-- Graviore lapsu
Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos
Fulmina montes.
The high hills are struck with thunderbolts, the tops of trees blasted with
lightnings, the pinacles of Temples, and fanes of turrets, and weathercockes of
steeples are frequently blown down with the wind, and all the storm, and
violence of weather beats upon the roofes and tops of houses: Qui jacet in
terra non habet unde cadat.

The opposition between the members of these two verses is very observable,
He humbled himself so low, therefore God exalted him so high. When man
humbles himself God exalts, but when man exalts himself God humbles:
how much better is it to humble our selves and be exalted by God, than to exalt
our selves and to be humbled by him. As none can raise so high, so none can
pull down so low as he. Lucifer who would have exalted himself above the
stars of heaven, was thrown down below the worms of the earth:
contrariwise, our Savior who humbled himself beneath the earth, even to the
gates of hell, was raised by God above the highest heavens. 1 Pet. 1.5, 6.
My exhortation therefore unto you is the same with that of the Apostle S.
Peter: Humble your selves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you
in due time: submit your selves one to another, deck your selves inwardly with
lowliness of mind. There is no virtue drawn by the pensill of God in more
lively colors, Psalm. 113.6, 7. Esaias 57.15. Mat. 11.25. Jam. 4.6, 10. Psalm.
113.8. Mat. 5.3.
with brighter beams of his favor shining upon them, than it: for he that
dwells in the highest heavens has respect to the lowest and lowliest, he
visits them, and dwells with them, he familiarly converseth with them, and
reveals unto them his secrets: he bestows on them the treasures of his
grace, he raises them and advances them to a kingdom on earth, yea to a
kingdom in heaven. To which kingdom the Lord exalt us for the merit of Christ
Jesus, who humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of
the cross; wherefore God has highly exalted him, and has given him a name
above all names, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every
tongue confess that Christ is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father. To
whom, etc.

A SUMMONS TO REPENTANCE. THE LIVE. SERMON.
EZEKIEL. 18.23. Have I any desire at all that the wicked should dye, says the
Lord God?


Right Honorable, etc.
WE read in our Calendars of some things that come in at one season and go
out at another; but sin is not of that nature, it is always coming in, but
never goes out till our exit out of this world. Therefore nothing is more
necessary at any time, or more seasonable at all times, than the doctrine of
repentance: we cannot hear too often of it, because Psalm. 19.12.
none knows how often he offends. Such is the weakness of our nature, and
the slipperinesse of our way in Apoc. 15.2.
this sea of glass whereupon we walk, that we slip and fall daily, and are
often maimed and wounded by our falls; and unless by grace the use of our
limbs be restored unto us and we raised up by repentance, we lie as a prey
for the Devil, 1 Pet. 5.8.
who runs about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour. Let it then
not seem grievous unto you to punish and 2 Cor. 7.11.
take revenge of your selves often, who transgress more often: to afflict your
souls often, who Ephesians. 4.30.
grieve Gods holy spirit more often, whereby ye are sealed to the day of
redemption. Sit par medicina vulneri, let the remedy be answerable to the
malady, let the plaster fit the wound; if the wounds be many let the plasters
be diverse, if the wounds be wide let the plasters be large. Now to persuade
all that hear me this day willingly to apply these smarting plasters, to
undertake joyfully this task of godly sorrow, and perform cheerfully this
necessary duty of mourning for our sins, I have chosen this Text: wherein
God by expressing his desire of the life of a penitent sinner, assures us that
we shall obtain our desires, and recover the health of our soul if we take
the Physic he prescribes.

Have I any desire that a sinner should dye, and not that he should return
from his wicked way and live? Verse. 22, 24.
If the wicked shall turn from all his sins that he has committed, and
keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall
surely live, he shall not dye. All his transgressions that he has committed,
they shall not be mentioned unto him; in his righteousness that he has done,
he shall live. But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness and
commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked
man does, shall he live? All the righteousness that he has done shall not
be mentioned: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that
he has sinned, in them he shall dye. That is briefly, If repentance follow
after sin, life shall follow after repentance; if sin follow finally after
repentance, death shall follow after sin. O presumptuous sinner despair not,
for repentance without relapse is assured life: O desperate sinner presume not,
for relapse without repentance is certain death. Art thou freed from
desperation? take heed how thou presumest: have thou presumed? yet by no means
despair. Nec spera ut pecces, nec despera si peccasti; Neither hope that thou
may continue in sin, neither despair after thou have sinned, but pray and
labor for repentance never to be 2 Cor. 7.10.
repented of.

But before I pitch upon the interpretation of the words, give me leave to
glance at the occasion, which was a Proverbiall speech taken up by the Jews in
those days wherein Ezekiel prophesied; Chapter 18..2.
( The Jer. 31.29. In those days they shall say no more, the fathers have
eaten a sour grape, and the childrens teeth are set on edge.
fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge:) of
which we may say as Vell. Pater. hist. l. 2. Disertus, sed nequa^, and
facundus, sed malo publico.
Velleius Paterculus does of Curio, It is a witty, but a wicked Proverb,
casting a blot of injustice upon the proceedings of the Judge of all flesh.
Aristot. l. de mirabil. auscul.
Aristotle reports it for a certain truth, That vulturs cannot away with
sweet ointments; and that the Cantharides are killed and dye suddenly with the
strong sent and smell of roses: which makes it seem less strange to me that
the doctrine of the Gospel, which is a savor of life unto life, should prove
to some no better than a savor of death unto death: and the judgments of God
which were sweeter to David's taste than the honey and the honey comb, should
taste so sower and sharp in the mouths of these Jews (with whom the Prophet
had to do) that they set their teeth on edge, and their tongue also against
God himself; whom they stick not to charge with injustice for laying the
fathers sins to the sons charge, and requiring satisfaction of the one for
the other. Our fathers, say they, have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens
teeth are set on edge: What justice is there in this? why should we smart for
our forefathers sins? and lie by it for their debt? The depulsion of which
calumny is the argument of this Chapter; wherein the Prophet clears the
justice of God from the former foul aspersion, both by denying the instance,
and disproving the inference upon it. They were not, says he, the grapes your
fathers ate that have set your teeth on edge, but the sour fruit of your own
sin. Neither does God seek occasion to punish you undeservedly, who is
willing to remit the most deserved punishments of your former sins, upon your
present sorrow and future amendment. So far is he from laying the blame of your
fathers sins upon you, that he will not proceed against you for your own
sins, if you take a course hereafter to discharge your consciences of them. The
sufficiency of which answer will appear more fully, by laying it to the former
objection; which may be thus propounded in form: He who punishes the children
for the fathers fault, offers hard and uneven measure to the children.

But God threateneth to do so, and he often Plut. de ser. number. vind. Antigonus
propter Demetrium, Phylenus propter Augaeum, Nestor propter Neleum poenas
sustinuere. Hes. op. and diei. (...). Exodus 20.5 Visiting the sins of the
fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation.
does so. For Herod. in Clio Croesus quintae retro aetatis poenas luit, hoc
est, Abavus, qui cum esset satelles, Heraclidum Dominum interemit.
Croesus lost his kingdom for the sin of his great great great grandfather.
Rhehoboam the ten Tribes for the sins of Solomon. The posterity of Ahab was
utterly destroyed for the sin of their parents: and upon the Jews forty years
after the death of our Savior there came all the righteous blood shed upon
that land, from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias the
son of Barachias, whom they slew between the Temple and the Altar. Matthew.
23.35, 36.
Verily (says our Savior) all these things shall come upon this generation.

Ergo, God offers hard and uneven measure to the children.



In which Syllogism, though the major or first proposition will hardly bear
scale in the uneven balances of man's judgment, (for in some case the son
loses his honor for his fathers sake, as of treason) yet the Prophet takes
no exception at it, but shapes his answer to the assumption, which is this in
effect, that their accusation is a false calumny, that he that eats the sour
grapes his teeth shall be set on edge: that the son shall not bear the
iniquity of his father, but that the soul which sins shall dye. For
howsoever God may sometimes spare the father for many excellent virtues, and
yet cut off the son for the same sin; because he is heir of his fathers
vices, but not of his virtues: or he may lance sometimes the sin in the
son, when it is ripe, which he permitted to grow in the father without
applying any such remedy outwardly unto it: yet this is most certain, that he
never visits the sin of the father upon the children, if the children tread
not in the wicked steps of their father. Thus much the words that follow in the
second Commandment imply, unto the Exodus 20.5.
third and fourth generation of them that hate me. He often shows mercy to
the son for the fathers sake, but never executes justice upon any but for
their own sins. The sin of the son grows the more unpardonable, because
he would not take example by his father, but abused the long-suffering of God,
which should have called him to repentance. The Latin Proverb ( Aemilius
fecit, plectitur Rutilius; Aemilius commits the trespass, and Rutilius was
merced for it) has no place in Gods proceedings, neither is there any ground
of the Poets commination, Hor. l. 3. od. 6. and lib. 1. od. 28. Negligis
immeritis nocituram postmodo te natis fraudem committer^: fors and debita jura
vicesque superbae te maneant ipsum.
Delicta majorum immeritus lues Roman. For God is so far from inflicting
punishment upon one for the sins of another, that he inflicteth no punishment
upon any for his own sin or sins, be they never so many and grievous, if he
turn from his wicked ways, and cry for mercy in time: for God desires not
the death of a sinner, but of sin: he would not that we should dye in our
sins, but our sins in us. If we spare not our sins, but slay them with
the sword of the Spirit, God will spare us. This is the effect of the Prophets
answer, the sum of this chapter, and the contents of this verse: in which
more particularly we are to observe, 1. The person, I. 2. The action or
affection, desire. 3. The object, death. 4. The subject, the wicked.
1. The person sovereign, God. 2. The action or affection amiable, delight. 3.
The object dreadful, deprivation of life. 4. The subject guilty, the wicked.


The words are uttered by a figurative interrogation, in which there is more
evidence and efficacy, more life and convincing force. For it is as if he had
said, Know ye not that I have no such desire? or think ye that I have any
desire? or dare it enter into your thoughts, that I take any pleasure at all in
the death of a sinner? When the interrogation is figurative, the rule is, that
if the question be affirmative, the answer to it must be negative: but if the
question be negative, the answer must be affirmative. For example: Who is like
unto the Lord? the meaning is, none is like unto the Lord. Whom have I in
heaven but thee? that is, I have none in heaven but thee. On the other side,
when the question is negative, the answer must be affirmative: as, Are not the
Angels ministering spirits? that is, the Angels are ministering spirits: and,
Shall the Son of man find faith? that is, the Son of man shall not find faith.
Here then apply the rule, and shape a negative answer to the first member being
affirmative, thus: I have no desire that a sinner should dye; and an
affirmative answer to the negative member, thus: I have a desire that the
wicked should return and live; and ye have the true meaning and natural
exposition of this verse.

Have I any desire that the wicked should dye? 1. God is not said properly to
have any thing: 2. if he may be said to have any thing, yet not desires: 3. if
he may be said to have a desire of any thing, yet not of death: 4. if he desire
the death of any, yet not of the wicked in his sin.

Have I? As the habits of the body are not the body, so neither the habits of
the soul are the soul it self. Now whatsoever is in God is God: for he is a
simple act, and his qualities or attributes are not re ipsa distinct from his
essence; and therefore he cannot be said properly to have any thing, but to be
all things.

Any desire. Desires, as Plato defines them, are vela animi, the sails of the
mind, which move it no other ways than the sail does a ship. Desire of honor
is the sail which moves the ambitious: of pleasure is the sail which moves
the voluptuous: of gain is the sail which moves the covetous. Others define
them spurs of the soul to prick us on forwards to such things as are most
agreeable to our natural inclination and deliberate purposes. Hence it
appears, that properly there can be no desires in God, because desire is of
something we want; but God wants nothing. Desires are means to stir us up,
but God is immovable as he is immutable. If then he be said to desire any
thing, the speech is borrowed, and to be understood (...), in such sort as may
agree with the nature of God; and it imports no more than God likes or
approves such things.

That the wicked should dye. A sinner may be said to dye two manner of ways;
either as a sinner, or as a man: as a sinner he dies when his sin dies in
him, and he lives: as a man he dies, either when his body is severed from his
soul, which is the first death; or when both body and soul are for ever
severed from God, which is the second death. God desires the death of a sinner
in the first sense, but no way in the latter: he desires that sin should dye
in us, but neither that we should dye the first death in sin, nor dye the
second death for sin. He is the author of life, Job 7.20.
preserver of mankind. He is the 1 Timothy 4.10.
Savior of all, especially them that believe. He would not that any should 2
Pet. 3.9.
perish, but all should come to repentance. If he should desire the death of a
sinner, as he should gainsay his own word, so he should desire against his
own nature. For being is the nature of God, Sum qui sum, I am that I am, but
death is the not being of the creature. No more than light can be the cause of
darkness, can God, who is life, be the cause of death. If he should desire the
death of a sinner, he should destroy his principal attributes of wisdom,
goodness, and mercy: Of wisdom; for what wisdom can it be to mar his
chiefest work? Of goodness; for how can it stand with goodness to desire
that which is in it self evil? Of mercy; for how can it stand with mercy, to
desire or take pleasure in the misery of his creature? Does he desire the death
of man, who gave man warning of it at the first, and means to escape it if he
would: and after that by his voluntary transgression he was liable to the
censure of death, provided him a Redeemer to ransom him from death; calls
all men by the Gospel to faith and repentance unto life, gives charge to his
Apostles and their successors to preach the Gospel unto every creature, saying:
Mar. 16.16.
Whosoever believes and is baptized, shall be saved?

But here some cast a dark mist, which has caused many to lose their way. How
(say they) do we maintain that God desires not the death of a sinner, who
before all time decreed death for sin, and sin for death? This mist in part
is dispelled by distinguishing of three sorts of Gods decrees:

1. There is an absolute decree and resolute purpose of God, for those things
which he determines shall be.

2. There is a decree of mandate, or at least a warrant for those things which
he desires should be.

3. There is a decree of permission for such things, as if he powerfully stop
them not, will be.

Of the first kind of decree or will of God, we are to understand those words
of the Psalmist, Quaecunque voluit, fecit Deus; Whatsoever Psalm. 135.6.
God would, that has he done: and of our Savior, Father, John 17.24. and Romans
9.19. Ephesians. 1.5. 1 Timothy 2.4.
I will that they also whom thou have given me be with me where I am. To the
second we are to refer those words of the Apostle, God would have all men to
come to the knowledge of the truth, God would that all should come to 2 Pet.
3.9.
repentance: and, This is the will of God, even your 1 These. 4.3.
sanctification: and, Romans 12.2.
Be ye not conformed to this present world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the acceptable and perfect
John 7.17.
will of God. In the last acception the Apostle seems to take the word will
in those words: It is better, if the 1 Pet. 3.17.
will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing: and
Saint Austine, where he maintains that even those things that are most
repugnant to the Law of God, and so directly against his revealed will, are not
besides his will, but in some sort fall within the compass of his decrees. The

will of God is done by or upon them, who seem to cross his will, after a
wonderful and unspeakable manner; that comes not to pass but by Gods will
(that is, his secret decree) which is done against his will, (that is, his
command.) For it could not be if he suffered it not, neither does he suffer it
against his will, but with his will: neither would he who it good suffer evil
to be, but that by his omnipotency he can draw good out of evil.

The second distinction, which much cleereth the point in question, is of good
things, which may be sorted thus: 1. Some are good formally, good in
themselves, and by and for selves: as all divine graces, and the salvation of
the elect. 2. Some things are good suppositively and consequently: as war is
good not simply, but when without it either the safety or the honor of the
state cannot be preserved: in like manner executions are nor good simply, but
upon presupposall of heinous crimes worthy of death in him that is executed
especially for the terror of others. No man will say that it is simply good to
lance or cut off a joint, yet is it good in case that otherwise the sore
cannot, be healed, or the sound parts preserved from a gangrene. 3. Some things
are good occasionally only or by accident, from whom some good may come, or be
made of them, or out of them: as treacle of poison, and wholesome pills of such
ingredients as are enemies to nature.


If ye rightly apply these distinctions, ye may without great difficulty loosen
the knots above tied: the first whereof was, whether God decreed sin
original or actual. Ye may answer according to the former distinctions, that
he decreed effectually all the good that is joined with it, or may come by it,
or it may occasion: but he decreed permissively only the Al Monim. Malum
praescivit Deus, non praedestinavit.
Anomy, obliquity, or malignity thereof: he neither does it, nor approves of
it when it is done, but only permits it, and takes advantage of it for the
manifestation of his justice. When Fulgentius denies that God decrees sin,
and the Council. Araus. Ad malum divina potestate praedestinatos non modo non
dicimus, sed etiam siqui sint qui id affirmare ausint, cum summa execratione in
eos anathema dicimus.
Arausican Council thundereth out an anathema against any that dare maintain
such an impious assertion, they are to be understood of a decree of effecting,
or commanding, or warranting it. But when Calvin pleads hard for Adams fall to
have not come to pass without a decree from God; lest he should make God an
idle spectatour of an event of so great consequence, we are to interpret his
words of a decree of permission of the event, and disposing of the fall
foreseen by him, to the greater manifestation of his justice and mercy.
Ordinavit (says Junius) id est, statuit ordinem rei, non rem ipsam decrevit.

To the second question, which touches the apple of the eye of this Text,
whether God decrees the death of any? ye may answer briefly, that he does not
decree it any way for it self, as it is the destruction of his creature, or a
temporal or eternal torment thereof; but as it is a manifestation of his
justice.

Here I might take occasion (as many do) to dispute diverse intricate questions
concerning the decrees of God, especially of reprobation, both absolute and
comparative; and the acts of it, privative and positive: whether it depend
merely upon the will of God, or pass ex praevisis, or propter praevisa
peccata, upon, or for sins foreseen, original or actual: as also
concerning the object, whether it be homo condendus, conditus, integer, or
lapsus, whether man considered in fieri, as clay or red earth in the hands of
God, out of which some vessels were to be made to honor, some to dishonor; or
as created of God according to his image before his fall, or as fallen in Adam,
tainted with original sin: or lastly, singular persons considered in the
state of infidelity or impenitency, and so dying; sed Scotus in 1. sent. did.
41.
nolo scrutari profundum, ne eatur in profundum; I will not approach too near
this deep whirle-poole, lest with many through giddiness of brain I fall into
it. For although I have read what S. Austine writes touching these points to
Epist. 105 and lib. 1. ad simpl. q. 2.
Sixtus, Prosper to Vincentius, Falgentius to Monimus, what the 4. Councels
held at Arles, Arausica, Valentia, and Mentz decreed against or for

Mediovillanus, and the Dominicans resolve on the one side; and what Loc supr.

and the Franciscans generally on the other side, and lastly what the
Remonstrants and Contra-remonstrants in our age have published one against the
other to the worlds view: yet I profess I find many thorny difficulties, which
cannot be plucked out but with that strong hand of the Apostle, O Romans 9.20, 21.
man, who art thou that disputest with God? Shall the thing formed say to him
that formed it, Why have thou made me thus? Has not the potter power over the
clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto
dishonor? When all mankind in Adam lay in the snares of death, in which they
entangled themselves, to have left all in that woeful plight had been justice
without mercy, to have plucked all out had been mercy without justice; but to
draw out some, and leave others in that doom which all had deserved, declares
both the divine attributes of justice and mercy: justice eternally shining in
the deserved flames of the damned, and mercy in the undeserved crowns of the
elect. But why more are not ordained to be saved than to be damned; why of
children yet unborne one should be loved, and another hated; why the Infidels
child sometimes comes to baptism, and the seed of the faithful dies without
it; why Christ wrought not those Mat. 11.20.
miracles in Tyrus and Sidon, which he did in Capernaum, since he knew they
would have brought those Heathens to repentance in sackcloth and ashes, whereas
they took no good effect with the Capernaits; why St. Act. 16.6, 7.

found of some who seek him not, and not found of others who seek him with
tears; why some of most harmless and innocent carriage yet live and dye in
those places, where they never can hear of any tidings of the Gospel, others
who have given scope to their vicious desires, and for many years continued in
a most abominable estate of life, defiling their mouths with blasphemy, their
hands with theft and murder, their whole body with uncleanness, yet before
their death have the Gospel preached unto them, and their hearts opened to give
heed unto it, and they sealed to the day of redemption: I profess with Saint
Amb. l. de vocat. gent. c. 5. Cur illorum sit misertus non horum quae scientia
potest comprehendere? liberatur pars hominum part pereunte, and si hoc
voluntatis meritis velimus ascribere, resistet innumerabilium causa populorum.
Ambrose, Latet discretionis ratio, non latet ipsa discretio; this difference
which God makes of men is apparent, but the reason thereof is not apparent. I
confess with S. Qui in factis Dei rationem non invenit, in infirmitate sua
rationem invenit quare rationem non inveniat.
Gregory, he that finds not a reason of the actions of God, finds a reason in
his own infirmity why he cannot find it. I resolve with Saint Aug. de verb.

Austine, Seek thou a reason, I will tremble at the depth of Gods councels:
dispute thou, I will believe: I see depth, I find no bottom. Do thou, O
man, look for a reason of me? I am a man as well as thou; therefore let us
both give ear to him, who says, O homo, O man, what art thou who stands
upon terms with thy Maker, and holds out argument against him? If ever that
censure of the Poet fell justly upon any, Nae Terent. in Andria.
intelligendo faciunt, ut nihil intelligant; they understand themselves out of
their wits, it most deservedly lights on those in our age, who cast all Gods
works in the mould of their own brain, and take upon them to yield a reason
of his eternal counsels; as if they had been his Romans 11.33, 34.
counselors, who search into the unsearchable judgments of God, and will seem
to find those ways which are past finding out. Romans 11.33, 34.
O the deph of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out? Who has
known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counselor? These men
resemble those that unskilfully handle knots of wier strings, who by taking the
wrong end, the more they labor to untwist them, the more they tangle them, and
in the end are forced to cast them away as unserviceable for their instruments:
wherefore leaving their curious speculations upon my Text, I come to a brief
application.

1. Does God take no pleasure in the death of the wicked that daily transgress
his Law, grievously provoke his wrath, ungraciously abuse his mercy, and
slightly regard his judgments? Does he use all good means to reclaim them,
and save them from wrath to come? Is the life of every man so precious in his
eyes? Does he esteem of it as a rich jewel engraven with his own image? how
careful then and chary ought we to be, who are put in trust with it (locked up
in the casket of our body) that we lose it not by careless negligence, much
less expose it for a prey to others by duels, either sending or accepting
challenges? Do we set such an invaluable jewel, as is the life of our bodies
and souls, at so low a rate, that we will put it to the hazard, as it were to
the cast of a Die for a matter of naught, a toy, a trifle, a jussle, a taking
of the wall, an affront, a word? Do we make so small reckoning of that which
cost our Savior his dearest hearts blood?

2. If Judges, and all those who sit upon life and death did enter into a
serious consideration thereof, they would not so easily (as sometimes they do)
cast away a thing that is so precious, much less receive the price of blood.
For if it be accounted, and that deservedly, a sin of a deep die, to buy and
sell things dedicated to the service of God, what punishment do they deserve,
who buy and sell the living image of God? It is reported of Augustus, that he
never pronounced a capital sentence without fetching a deep sigh; and of Titus
the Emperor, that he willingly accepted of the Priests office, that he might
never have his hand dipped in blood; and of Nero, that when he was to set his
hand to a capital sentence, he wished that he could not write, Utinam literas
nescirem: therefore let those Judges think what answer they will make at
Christ's Tribunal, who are so far from Christian compassion, and hearts
grief, and sorrow, when they are forced to cut off a member of Christ by the
sword of justice, that they sport themselves, and break jests, and most
inhumanely insult upon the poor prisoner, whose neck lies at the stake. If
any sin against our neighbor leave a deep stain in our conscience, it is
the bloody sin of cruelty. Other sins may be hushed in the conscience, and
rocked asleep with a song of Gods mercy; but this is reckoned in holy Scripture
among those Genesis 4.10.
crying sins, that never will be quiet till they have awaked Gods revenging
justice. This is a crimson sin, and I pray God it cleave not to their
consciences, who wear the scarlet robe. If there be any such Judges, I leave
them to their Judge, and briefly come to you, Right Honorable, etc. with the
short exhortation of the Apostle, Put you on the Colos. 3.12.
bowels of mercy and compassion; and if ever the life of your brethren be in
your hands, make special reckoning of it, in no wise rashly cast it away: let
it not go out of your hands, unless the law and justice violently wrest and
extort it from you. Assure your selves, that it is a far more honorable
thing, and will gain you greater love and favor with God, and reputation with
men, to Cicer. pro Quint. de Aquil. Mavult commemorare se cum perdere potuerat
pepercisse, quam cum parcere potuerat perdidisse.
save a man whom ye might have cast away, than to cast him away under any
pretense whom ye might have saved.

4. If a malefactor arraigned at the bar of justice, should perceive by any
speech, gesture, sign, or token, an inclination in the Judge to mercy, how
would he work upon this advantage? what suit? what means would he make for
his life? how would he importune all his friends to entreat for him? how would
he fall down upon his knees and beseech the Judge for the mercies of God to be
good unto him? Hoe all ye that have guilty consciences, and are privy to your
selves of many capital crimes, though peradventure no other can appeach you,
behold, the Judge of all flesh makes an overture of mercy, he bewrays more
than a propension or inclination, he discovers a desire to save you, why do
ye not make means unto him? why do ye not appeal from the bar of his
justice to his throne of grace? why do ye not fly from him as he is a
terrible Judge, to him as he is a merciful Father? Though by nature ye are the
sons of wrath, yet by grace ye are the adopted sons of the Father of mercy,
and God of all consolation, who stretches out his arms all the day long unto
us. Let us turn to him, yea though it be at the last hour of our death, and
he will turn to us: let us repent us of our sins, and he will repent him of
his judgments: let us retract our errors, and he will reverse his sentence:
let us wash away our sins with our tears, and he will blot out our sentence
with his Sons blood. When Dan. 5.5.
Belshazzar saw the handwriting against him on the wall, his heart mis-gave
him, all his joints trembled, and his knees smote one against the other.
Beloved Christians, there is a Colos. 2.14.
handwriting of ordinances against us all, and if we see or mind it not, it
writes more terrible things against us. What shall we do to be rid of this
fear? Is there any means under heaven to take out the writing of God against
us? Yes beloved, tears of repentance with faith in Christ's blood makes that
aqua fortis that will fetch out even the handwriting of God against us. The
Prophet records it for a miraculous accident, that the sun went back many
degrees in the Dyall of Esa. 38.8.
Ahaz. Beloved, our fervent prayers and penitent tears will work a greater
miracle than this, they will bring back again the Mal. 4.2.
Sun of righteousness, after he is set in our souls. God cannot sin, Angels
cannot repent, only man that sins is capable of repentance; and shall we
not embrace that virtue which is only ours? Other virtues are remedies against
special maladies of the soul: as humility against pride, hope against
despair, courage against fear, chastity against lust, meekness against
wrath, faith against diffidence, charity against covetousness; but repentance
is a sovereign remedy against all the maladies of the mind. Other virtues
have their seasons: as patience in adversity, temperance in prosperity,
almsdeeds when our brothers necessity calls upon our charity, fasting when
we afflict our souls in time of plague, or any other judgment of God; but
repentance is always in season, either for our grosser sins, or for failing
in our best actions: if for no other cause, yet we are to repent for the
insincerity and imperfection of our repentance. I will end this my exhortation
as the Prophet does this chapter, Ezekiel. 18.30.31.
Repent and turn your selves from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall
not be your ruin. Cast away all your transgressions whereby ye have
transgressed, and make you new hearts and new spirits, for why will ye die O
ye house of Israel, says the Lord God? wherefore turn your selves and live
ye. O Lord, who desire not that we should die in our sins, but our sins
in us, mortify our fleshly members by the power of thy Sons death, and renew
us in the spirit of our minds by the virtue of his resurrection, that we may
die daily to the world, but live to heaven; die to sin, but live to
righteousness; die to our selves, but live to thee. Thou by the Prophet
professest thy desire of our conversion, say but the word and we shall be
converted: call us by thy spirit and we shall hear thee, and hearing thee
turn from our wicked ways, and turning live a new life of grace here, and an
eternal life of glory hereafter in heaven, with thee O Father the infuser, O
Son the purchaser, O holy Spirit the preserver of this life. Amen. Cui, etc.

THE BEST RETURN. THE LV. SERMON.
EZEKIEL. 18.23. Not that he should return from his ways and live? Or, if he
return from his evil ways shall he not live?


Right Honorable, etc.
SAint Possid. in vit.
Austine lying on his deathbed caused diverse verses of the penitential
Psalms to be written on the walls of his chamber, on which he still cast his
eyes, and commented upon them with the fluent Rhetoric of his tears. But I
could wish of all texts of Scripture that this of the Prophet Ezekiel were
still before all their eyes who mourn for their sins in private. For nothing
can raise the dejected soul but the lifting up of Gods countenance upon her;
nothing can dry her tears, but the beams of his favor breaking out of the
dark clouds of his wrath, and shining upon her: nothing can bring peace to an
affrighted and troubled conscience but a free pardon of all sins, whereby
she has incurred the sentence of death; which the Prophet tendereth in the
words of the text. Which are as the very heart of this chapter, and every word
thereof may serve as a principal vein to conveigh lifeblood to all the
languishing, or benumbed and deaded members of Christ his mystical body.
Return and live. These words are spirit and life, able to raise a sinner from
the grave, and set him on his feet, to tread firmly upon the ground of Gods
mercy: as also to put strength and vigor into his feeble and heavy limbs; 1.
to creep, then to walk, and last of all to run in the paths of Gods
commandments. The explication whereof to our understanding, and application to
our wills and affections, were the limits of my last Lords-dayes journey. By the
light which was then given you, ye might easily discern our lusts (which are
sudden motions) from Gods desires, which are eternal purposes: and distinguish
between a sinner who is not purged from all dregs of corruption, and a
wicked person who Moab-like is settled upon his lees; between a common
infirmity, and a dangerous sickness; between sin in the act, and wickedness
in the habit. Questionless there is more reason to pity him that falls or
slippeth, than him that leapeth into the sink of sin, and daily walloweth in
the mire of sensual pleasures. Yet such is the mercy and goodness of almighty
God, that he desires not that the wicked, such as make a trade of sin, and
have a stiff neck, a hard heart, a seared conscience, that the wretchedst
miscreants that breathe should either dye in their sins here, or for their
sins hereafter. The former of the two is the death of life, the latter we
may significantly term the life of death, which exercises the damned with
most unsufferable pangs and torments for evermore. Here when we part life
dies, but in hell death lives, and the terrors and pangs thereof are renewed
and increased daily; the former death is given to the vessels of wrath for
their earnest, the latter is paid them for their wages. This death is properly
the wages of sin, which God cannot in justice withold from the servants of
sin, and vassals of Satan.

For God, whose infinite wisdom comprehends not only the necessity of all
effects in their determined, but also the possibility in their supposed causes;
foreseeing from all eternity what an intelligent nature, endued with freewill,
left to himself, would do; how he would fall, and wound himself by his
fall; and knowing how he could so dispose of his fall, and cure his wound,
that his (the Creators) glory might be no whit impaired, but rather increased
by not powerfully hindering it; decreed to create this creature for his glory:
which he appointed to show upon him by three means. 1. By way of general
bounty, in placing the first parents of mankind in Paradise, and in them
giving all sufficient means to bring them to eternal happiness; an end
infinitely elevated above the pitch of their own nature: and after the abuse
of their free will, and loss of that happy estate in which they were created,
and bringing themselves into thraldom to sin and Satan. 2. By way of
special mercy, graciously freeing, freely justifying, justly glorifying some
Romans 9.23.
in and by Christ, viz. the vessels of mercy prepared unto glory. 3. By way of
justice, in utterly leaving, or uneffectually calling, and upon abuse or
refusal of some measure of grace offered to them, deservedly hardening, and
upon their final incredulity and impenitency necessarily condemning, and in
the end eternally punishing others, to wit, the vessels of wrath, (...), made
up, or fitted to destruction. This fabric of celestial doctrine, strongly
built upon evident texts of Scriptures, may serve for a fortress to defend
this text, and the principal doctrines contained in it, against all the
batteries of Heretics and Atheists made against it. viz.

1. That God approves not the death of the wicked in his sin, but on the
contrary, likes, and commands, and takes pleasure in his conversion.

2. That he decrees not, or desires the death of any wicked for it self, as
it is the misery and destruction of his creature; but as a manifestation of his
justice. For he Lam. 3.33.
punishes not (...) with his heart, or willingly: he made not death, nor
delights in the Wisd. 1.13. Fulgent. ad Mon. Mortem morienti non fecit, qui
mortem mortuo just retribuit.
destruction of the living. Thy destruction is from thy self, Hos. 13.9.
O Israel, but in me is thy help. The wicked after his hardness and
impenitent heart, treasureth up unto himself wrath against the day of wrath,
and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God: who renders to every man
according to his works. Upon which texts the Fathers infer, that not only
the execution, but the very decree of damnation of the reprobate passes upon
their sin foreseen. Saint Ep. ad Sixth. Vasa irae homines sunt propter
naturae bonu n creati, propter vitia s^pplicio destinati; and si vasa sint
perfecta in perditionem, sibi hoc imputent.
Austine, The vessels of wrath are wicked men created for the good of nature,
but destinated to punishment for their sins: And again, If they are fitted
to destruction let them thank themselves. Saint Prosper ad object. 3. Gal. Qui
a sanctitate vitae per immunditiem labuntur, non ex eo necessitatem pereundi
habuerunt, quia praedestinati non sunt, sed quia tales futuri ex voluntaria
praevaricatione praesciti sunt.
Prosper: They that fall away from holiness through uncleanness, lie not under
a necessity of perishing because they were not predestined: but therefore
were not predestined, because they were foreknowne that they would be such by
voluntary prevarication. Fulgent. l. 1. ad Mon. Iniquos quos praescivit Deus
hanc vitam in peccato terminaturos, decrevit supplicio interminabili puniendos;
and illos ad supplicium praedestinavit, quos a se praescivit vitio malae
voluntatis discessuros, and peccata hominum Deus praescivit, quib sententia^
praedestinatione dictavit.
Fulgentius: Those unjust men whom God foresaw that they would end their life
in sin, he decreed to punish in endless torments: And again, he
predestined them to punishment who he foresaw would depart from him by the
fault of their evil will: And again, God foresaw the sins of men, against
which he pronounced a sentence in his decree of predestination. And the
Fathers in the Synod held at Valent. can. 2. Nec ipsos malos ideo perire, quia
boni esse non potuerunt, sed quia boni esse noluerunt; suoque vitio in massa
damnationis, vel merito originali, vel etiam actuali permanserunt.
Valentia: The wicked perish not because they could not, but because they would
not be good, remaining in the mass of corruption by their own fault,
original or also actual: As likewise in the Council. Arelat. 3. Lucidi habetur
confessio his verbis: Profiteor aeternales flammas factis capitalibus
praeparatas.
Synod at Arles.

3. That he no way desires, nor decrees, nor so much as permits the death
of any of his Elect; though before their calling to the knowledge of the truth,
and sometimes after also, they so grievously transgress his holy laws, that
they may be numbered, at least for the time, among the wicked. For how far
soever they go in the ways of wickedness, they will turn at the last; and
if a sinner turn from his ways even at the brinke of destruction and gate of
hell, he shall live: for, Have I any desire at all that the wicked should die,
says the Lord God, and not that he should

Return? There are many turnings in the life of a Christian: The first turning
or conversion is by a sanctified phrase called regeneration, whereby we are
mortified in the flesh, but renewed in the spirit of our mind; we cast off
the old man, and put on the new. All after conversions are but so many
particular acts of repentance, and returns from those courses which we
ordinarily fall into, and follow, if Gods preventing grace stop not the motions
of our corrupt nature. This first conversion is as it were a general purgation
of all the peccant humors of our soul, and is of that force that it changes
and alters our temper and complexion. After this, all other aversions from
sin and returns to God, are but like special purgations, prescribed by the
Physician of our souls, to be taken upon special occasion, for the curing of
some particular malady. In the first, non agimus, sed agimur; we work not,
but are wrought upon, being, as the reformed Divines speak, mere passive: in
the other, acti agimus, being wrought upon we work, like the wheels in the
vision of Ezekiel, being moved by the spirit we move to Godward. At our first
conversion the Scripture compares us to dead men, that are not able to stir
any joint; but in all later conversions, after God hat breathed into us the
spirit of regeneration, to sick or weak men lying upon their bed, that are
able to turn themselves with some help. This distinction of conversions is
not new coined by us, but bears the stamp of ancient truth, and is current
in the Scriptures: in which wheresoever the faithful speak thus to God, Turn
us and we shall be turned, they aim at the first conversion; but where God
thus speaks to his people, Turn ye unto me, or, turn from your wicked
ways, we are to understand such texts of later conversions.

From his ways. Not from the ways of God, and paths of righteousness, but
his own ways, that is, such courses as he has taken beside, and against the
direction of Gods Spirit. More particularly thus; Have I not a desire that the
ambitious should leave his inordinate pursuit of honor, the covetous of gain,
the voluptuous of pleasure, and all of vanity, and that they should turn to
me with their whole heart, with a perfect hatred of their former wickedness,
and full and constant purpose of amendment, and so

Live? That is, escape eternal death, the due wages of sin, and attain
everlasting life, the undue reward of righteousness. If the fear of hellish
torments cannot make a separation between us and our beloved sins: nor hope
of heavenly joys win us unto God, it will be to small purpose to go about
to scare any with temporal plagues threatened in Gods law against sin, or
prick them with the sting of conscience, or confound them with shame, or
amplify upon the losses of spiritual graces, which can never be recovered
but by speedy and hearty repentance. The Spy of nature, in his book of the
length and shortness of life, demonstrateth natural heat and radical
moisture to be the sole preservers and maintainers of life, and the store of
both in due proportion to be the cause of longer life. As life is compared in
Scripture, so it is resembled in sculpture to a light or lamp burning; the
fire which kindles the flame of this lamp is natural heat, and the oil
which feeds it is radical moisture: without flame there is no light, without
oil to maintain it, no flame: in like manner if either natural heat, or
radical moisture fail, life cannot last: and as in a lamp, if by reason of
the thickness of the week the flame be too great, it oversoon sucketh up the
oil; if the oil be poured in in too great abundance, it choaketh the light:
so in us, if natural heat or radical moisture exceed measure or proportion,
the lamp of our life burns dimly, and in a short space is extinguished.
Answerable to the natural life in the body is the spiritual life of grace in
the soul: for as that is preserved calido and humido, by heat and moisture; so
is this also by the heat of love, or zeal of devotion, and the moisture of
penitent tears. Tears are the oil which feed this flame: for when we prick
deep the tenderest veins in our heart with remembrance of our manifold and
grievous transgressions, whereby we have dishonored God our Father,
displeased Christ our Redeemer, and grieved the Spirit of grace our Comforter:
when we take kindly to heart how that the better God has been unto us, the
worse we have proved unto him; the more grace has abounded, the more sin
has super abounded; when our hearts melt with these considerations, and our
eyes resolve into showers of tears; then we perceive that as salt water cast
into fire increases the heat, so the salt water of our tears inflameth our
devotion, kindles our zeal, and quickens all our spiritual exercises of
piety.

To nourish and maintain this oil, that our lamp go not out, I will
endeavor to open two springs in my Text; the one a higher, the other a lower:
the one arises from God and his joy, the other from our selves and our
salvation. That the conversion of a sinner is a joy and delight to God, I need
not to produce arguments to prove, or similes to illustrate; he that spoke as
never man spoke, has represented it unto us by many exquisite emblemes: The
Luke 15.4, 8, 10, 32.
joy of a woman for her lost groat found, of a shepherd for his wandering
sheep recovered, of a father for his prodigal child returned and reclaimed.
Saint L. 8. confess. c. 3. Quanto majus periculum fuit in proelio, tanto majus
gaudium in triumpho.
Austine yields a reason hereof, The more danger there is in the conflict
with temptation, the greater joy in the triumph. Such was the joy of the Church
for Cyp. de lapsis. Fortiores ignibus facti, qui antea ignibus cesserunt; and

Castus and Aemilius, who though at the first upon the sight of fire prepared
for them, they gave back, and were at a kind of stand, yet afterward, beyond
all hope and expectation, made a noble profession of their faith, and
gloriously endured the fiery trial. To whom did our Savior ever more honor,
than to Zacheus the converted Publicane, to whose house he came being not
invited, and brought with him the gladdest tidings that ever were heard there,
This Luke 19.9.
day salvation is come to this house: and to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he cast
seven Mat. 26.13.
Devils, to whom he first appeared after his resurrection, whose spikenard he
mingled with the ointment of the Gospel, in such sort that whosoever smells
the savor of life, has a sent also of the box of sweet perfume which she
brake upon our Saviors head? Scipio (as Livie writes) never looked so fresh,
nor seemed so beautiful in the eyes of his soldiers, as after his recovery
from a dangerous sickness which he took in the camp: neither does the soul
ever seem more beautiful, than when she is restored to health after some
dangerous malady. The Palladium was in highest esteem both with the Trojans and
Romans, not so much for the matter or workmanship, as because it was catched
out of the fire when Troy was burnt. And certainly no soul is more precious in
the eyes of God and his Angels, than that which is snatched out of the fire of
hell and jaws of death. As the woman in the Gospel more rejoiced for her lost
groat after she found it, than for all the groats she had safe in her chest:
and as the shepherd took more delight in his lost sheep after, he found it,
than in the rest which never wandered; so says our blessed Savior, Luke 15.7.
There shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over
ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance.

I have opened the first spring, and we have tasted the waters thereof: I am
now to open the second, which is this, That as our repentance is joy unto God
and his Angels, so it is grace and salvation to our selves. As repentance is
called Heb. 6.1.
repentance from dead works, so also Acts 11.18.
repentance unto life. For God pawnes his life for the life of the penitent: As
I live, says the Lord, I desire not the death of a sinner, but rather that he
should return and live. Plin. l. 2. c. 103 In Dodone Jovis fons, cum sit
gelidus, si extinctae faces admoveantur, extinguit. Causs. in Parab. hist. l.
10. In Epiro esse ferunt fontem, in quo faces accenduntur extinctae.
Pliny writes of a fountain in Africa, in which torches that are blown out
being dipped are kindled again: such is the fountain of tears in the eyes of
a penitent sinner; if the light of his faith be extinguished to his sense and
all outward appearance, yet dipped in this fountain, it is kindled again, and
burns more brightly than ever before. The Scripture furnishes us not with
many examples in this kind, lest any should presume; yet some we find that none
might despair. A man could hardly run a more wicked race than the thief
upon the Cross, who lived both in caede and ex caede, maintaining his riot and
wantonness by robbery and murder; yet he holds on his course even to the
goal, and there takes a greater booty than ever before: for he steals a
celestial Crown. And behold this thief nailed hand and foot to the Cross,
yet coming to our Savior by faith, and embracing him by love, and receiving
from him, together with a discharge from the prison of hell, a fair grant of
Paradise, Luke 23.43.
This day shall thou be with me in Paradise. It should seem they were ill
employed either all or the greatest part of that day, who came in but at the
last hour into the Lords Vineyard, yet they who came in then, received their
full hire. The Devil occupied a large room in Martes heart, and found there
good entertainment, else he would have never taken six other inmates with him
to dwell and lodge there; yet Christ cast all Mark 16.9.
seven out of her, and a whole legion out of Mark. 5.9.
another: and though this were a great miracle, yet to cheer up the drooping
looks, and comfort the fainting spirits, and strengthen the feeble knees of
all that bow to him for pardon and forgiveness, he wrought far greater. For
he raised three dead men; the first Mat. 9.25.
newly departed: the second Luke 7.12.
brought out, and lying upon the beer: the third John 11.44.
buried, and stinking in his grave. A man may be ill a long time before he take
his bed, and lie long in his bed before he feel the pangs of death, and be
long dead before he be buried, and a good while buried before he putrify: yet
to show that no time prescribes against Gods mercy, nor excludes our
repentance from dead works, Christ by miracle raised two that were dead, and a
third stinking in his grave. To comfort those that are wounded in conscience,
the good Luke 10.30.
Samaritan cured him that was wounded between Jerusalem and Jericho, and left
half dead: to comfort them that are sick in soul, he recovered Mat. 8.14.
Peter's wives mother lying sick in her bed: to comfort them that have newly as
it were given up the ghost, he raised Jairus daughter: to comfort them that
have been sometimes dead in sins and transgressions, he raised the widows
son: to comfort them that have been so long dead in sins that they begin to
putrify, he raised up Lazarus stinking in his grave. God forbid that any one
Devil should get possession of our hearts, yet seven, nay a legion may be cast
out by fasting and prayer. God forbid that any of us should be long sick of
any spiritual disease, yet those that have been sick unto death have been
restored; yea those that have been long dead have been raised. God forbid that
we should forsake our heavenly Fathers house, and in a strange country waste
his goods, and consume our portion; yet after we have run riot, and spent all
the gifts of nature, and goods of this life, and lavished out our time the most
precious treasure of all, yet in the end if we come to our selves, and look
homewards, our heavenly Father will meet us, and kill the fat calfe for u^.
Therefore if we have grievously provoked Gods justice by presumption, let us
not more wrong his mercy by despair; but hope even above hope in him, whose
mercy is over all his works. Against the number and weight of all our sins,
let us lay the infiniteness of Gods mercy, and Christ his merits, and the
certainty of his promise confirmed by oath: As I live, I desire not the death
of a sinner; if he return, he shall live. Oh (says Saint Bern. in Cant. Quis
dabit capiti meo aquam and oculis meis fontem lachrymarum, ut praeveniam
fletibus fletum and stridorem dentium?
Bernard) that mine eyes were springs of tears, that by my weeping here I
might prevent everlasting weeping and gnashing of teeth in hell. What pity is
it that we should fret and grieve, and disquiet our selves and others for the
loss of a Jewel from our ear, or a ring from our finger, and should take no
thought at all for the loss of the Jewels of Gods grace out of our souls? We
are overwhelmed as it were in a deluge of tears at the death of our friends,
who yet are alive to God, though dead to this world: but have we not a thousand
times greater reason to open those floodgates of salt waters which nature has
set in our eyes, for our selves, who are dead to God, though alive to the
world? St. De laps. Si quem de tuis chatis mortalitatis exitu perdidisses,
ingemisceres dolenter, and fleres, facie inculta, vest mutata, neglecto
capillo, vultu nubilo, ore dejecto, indicia moeroris ostenderes; animam tuam
miser perdidisti, spiritualiter mortuus es, supervivere hic tibi, and ipse
ambulans funus tuum portare caepisti, and non acriter plangis, non ^ugiter
ingemiscis.
Cyprian has a sweet touch on this string; If any of thy dear friends were
taken away from thee by death, thou would sigh, thou would sob, thou
would put on blacks, thou would hang do^ne thy head, thou would
dis-figure thy face, thou would let thy hair hang carelessly about thine
ears, thou would wring thy hands, thou would knock thy breast, thou
would throw thy self down upon the ground, thou would express sorrow in
all her gestures and postures: O wretched man that thou art, thou have lost thy
soul, thou art spiritually dead, thou survivest thy self, and carriest a dead
corpse about thee, and do thou not take on? do thou not fetch a deep sigh?
have thou not a compassionate tear for thy self? will thou not be thy own
mourner? especially considering that all thy weeping and howling for thy friend
cannot fetch him back again, or restore him to life; whereas thy weeping for
thy self in this vale of tears, and seriously bewailing thy sins, may and by
Gods grace shall revive thy soul, and recover all thy spiritual losses, and
that with advantage. Experience teaches us that the presentest remedy for a
man that is stung in any part of his body by a Scorpion, is to take the oil of
Scorpions, and therewith often to anoint the place: sin is the Scorpion that
stingeth our souls even to death, if we apply nothing to it; yet out of this
Scorpion sin it self, and the sorrow for it, an oil or water may be drawn
of penitent tears, wherewith if we anoint or wash our souls, we shall kill
the venom of sin, and allay the swelling of our conscience. Pind. od. 1.
(...), It is a most sovereign water which will fetch a sinner again to the
life of grace, though never so far gone. It is not Well water springing out
of the bowels of the earth, nor rain powered out of the clouds of passion, but
rather like a Cyp de card. Chris. op. De interioribus fontibus egrediuntur
torrentes, and super omnes delicias lachrymis nectareis anima delectatu^: non
illos imbres procellosae tempestates deponunt, ros matutinus est de coelestibus
stillans, and quasi unctio spiritus mentem deliniens, and post affectio se
abluit, and lachrymis baptizat.
dew falling from heaven, which softeneth and moisteneth the heart, and is
dried up by the beams of the Sun of righteousness.

Have not I a desire that the wicked should turn from his ways and live? When
a subject has rebelled against his natural Sovereign, or a servant
grievously provoked his master, or a son behaved himself ungraciously
toward his father, will the Prince sue to his subject, or a master to his
servant, or a father to his son for a reconciliation? Will not an equal that
has a quarrel with his equal hold it a great disgrace and disparagement to
make any means that the quarrel may be taken up? will he not keep out at
full distance, and look that the party, who (as he conceives) has wronged
him, should make first toward him, and seek to him? Yet such an affection God
bears to us, that though we (silly worms of the earth) swell and rise
against him, yet he seeks to us, he sends Ambassadors to 2 Cor. 5.19, 20.
treat of peace, and entreat and beseech us to be reconciled unto God. For God
was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses
unto them, and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we
are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you
in Christ's stead, be reconciled unto God. Stand not out, my dear brethren,
resign the strong holds of your carnal imaginations and affections, deliver
up your members, that they may serve as weapons of righteousness, and yield
your selves to his mercy, and ye shall live.

Turn and live. Should a prisoner led to execution hear the Judge or Sheriff
call to him, and say, Turn back, put in sureties for thy good behavior
hereafter, and live; would he not suddenly leap out of his fetters, embrace the
condition, and thank the Judge or Sheriff upon his knees? And what think ye
if God should send a Prophet to preach a Sermon of repentance to the devils and
damned ghosts in hell, and say, Knock off your bolts, shake off your fetters,
and turn to the Lord and live? would not hell be emptied and rid before the
Prophet should have made an end of his exhortation? This Sermon the Prophet
Ezechiel now makes unto us all here present, Ezekiel. 33.11. and 18.30.31.
As I live, says the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but
that he turn from his ways and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil
ways, for why will ye die? Repent, and turn your selves from all your
transgressions: so iniquity shall not be your destruction. Cast away all your
transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart, and a
new spirit: for why will ye perish? Shake off the shackles of your sins, and
quit the company of the prisoners of death, and gally-slaves of Satan, put in
sureties for your good behavior hereafter, turn to the Lord your God with all
your heart, and live, yea live gloriously, live happily, live eternally: which
the Father of mercy grant for the merits of his Son, through the grace of the
Spirit. To whom, three persons and one God, be ascribed all honor, glory,
praise, and thanks now and for ever. Amen.

THE DANGER OF RELAPSE. THE LVI SERMON.
EZEKIEL. 18.24. But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and
commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked
man does shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not
be mentioned: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that
he has sinned, in them shall he dye.


Right Honorable, etc.
SAint Jerome makes a profitable use of the Genesis 28.12. And he dreamed, and
behold a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and
behold the Angels of God ascending and descending on it.
Angels ascending and descending upon the ladder which Jacob saw in a dream,
reaching from the earth to heaven. The ladder he will have to be the whole
frame of a godly life, set upwards toward heaven, whereupon the children of
God, who continually aspire to their inheritance that is above, arise from the
ground of humility, and climb by divine virtues, as it were so many rounds one
above another, till Christ take them by the hand of their faith, and receive
them into heaven. They are styled Angels in regard of their Phil. 3.20.
heavenly conversation: these Jacob saw continually ascending and descending
upon that ladder, viz. ascending by the motions of the spirit, but descending
through the weight of the flesh; rising by the strength of grace, but falling
through the infirmity of nature: and hereby (says that learned Father) Hieron.
ep. 11. Videbat scalam per quam ascendebant Angeli, and descendebant, ut nec
peccator desperet salutem, nec justus de sua virtute securus sit.
we are lessoned not to despair of grace, because Jacob saw Angels ascending;
as they fell so they rose: nor yet presume of their own strength, for he saw
Angels descending also; as they rose so they fell. Presumption and desperation
are two dangerous maladies, not more opposite one to the other, than to the
health of the soul: presumption overpriseth Gods mercy, and undervalueth our
sins: and on the contrary desperation overpriseth our sins, and
undervalueth Gods mercy: both are most injurious to God; the one derogateth
from his mercy, the other from his justice, both band against hearty and speedy
repentance; the one opposing it as needless, the other as bootlesse:
presumption says thou may repent at leisure, gather the buds of sinful
pleasures before they wither, repentance is not yet seasonable: desperation
says, the root of faith is withered, it is now too late to repent. The learned
dispute whether of these two be the more pernicious and dangerous; the answer
is easy, presumption is the more epidemicall, desperation, the more mortal
disease. Presumption, like the Adder, stingeth more; but desperation, like the
Basiliske, stings more deadly: many meet with Adders, which are almost found in
all parts of the world; but few with Basiliskes. Presumption is more dangerous
extensive, for it carries more to hell: but desperation intensive, for those
whom it seizes upon it carries more forcibly and altogether irrecoverably
thither: and final desperation never brings men to presumption, but
presumption brings men often to final desperation. To meet with these most
pernicious evils, God has given us both the Law and the Gospel; the Law to
keep us under in fear, that we rise not proudly and presumptuously against
him; and the Gospel to raise us up in hope that the weight of our sins sink
us not in despair: the threats of the one serve to draw and assuage the tumor
of pride; the promises of the other, to heal the sores of wounded consciences:
and the Scripture (as Saint Basil rightly calls it) is (...), a common
Apothecaries shop, or physic school, wherein are remedies for all the
diseases of the soul. In these verses, as in two boxes there are sovereign
recipes against both the maladies above named: against the former, to wit,
desperation, verse. 23. against the later, viz. presumption, v. 24. And it is
not unworthy your observation, that as in the beginning of the Spring when
Serpents breed and peep Adrianus Chamierus in ep. dedicat. Eccles. Gal.
Pastor. Sicut ineunte vere cum primum e terrae cuniculis prodeunt serpents ad
nocendum parati, fraxinum adversus venenatos eorum morsus praesens remedium
laturam educit.
out of their holes, the Ash puts forth, which is a present remedy against
their stings and teeth: so the holy Ghost in Scripture for the most part
delivers an antidote in, or hard by those texts, from whence libertines and
carnal men suck the poison of presumption. The texts are these: God has
raised up an horn of salvation for us, that we being delivered out of the
hands of our enemies, might serve him without fear. Romans 5.20.
Where sin abounded grace did much more abound. Romans 8.1.
There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Gal. 5.13.
We are called to liberty. Now see an antidote in the verses following. Lest
any man should suck poison from these words in the first text, Serve him
without fear; it is added in the next words, in holiness and righteousness
before him all the days of our life. Lest any man should abuse the second, the
Apostle within a verse puts in a caveat, What shall we say then? shall we
continue in sin that grace may abound? Luke 1.69, 72, 74.
God forbid: how shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? verse.
1, 2. Lest any should gather too far upon that general speech of the
Apostle, There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, Luke 1.75.
there follows a restriction in the same verse, who walk not after the flesh,
but after the spirit. Lest any should stumble at those words of the same
Apostle, Ye are called to liberty, he reaches them a hand, and gives them a
stay in the next clause; only use not liberty for an occasion unto the flesh.
Lest any presumptuous sinner should lay hold on the horns of the Altar, and
claspe about that gracious promise, Tit. 2.11.
The grace of God that brings salvation unto all men has appeared, he
beats off their fingers in the next verse: teaching us, that denying
ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
godly in this present world. In like manner, lest any should 2 Pet. 3.16.
wrest the former verse of this Prophet, as they do the other Scriptures, to
the building forts of presumption, but to the apparent ruin of their own
souls, the Prophet forcibly withstandeth them in the words of my text, But
when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, etc. The life of a
Christian is not unfitly compared to a long and dangerous sea voyage; the sea
is this present world, the barks are our bodies, the sailers our souls, the
pylot our faith, the card Gods Word, the rudder constancy, the anchor hope, the
maine mast the cross of Christ, the strong cables our violent affections, the
sails our desires, and the holy Spirit the good wind which fills the sails
and drives the bark and mariners to the fair Act. 27.8.
haven which is heaven. Now in our way which lies through many temptations and
tribulations, there are two dangerous rocks, the one on the right hand, the
other on the left; the rock on the right hand to be avoided is presumption, the
rock on the left threatening shipwreck is despair; between which we are to
steer our ship by fear on the one side and hope on the other. To hold us in a
solicitous fear that we touch not upon presumption, let us have always in the
eye of our mind, 1 The glorious and most omnipotent majesty of God. 2 His
all-seeing providence. 3 His impartial justice. 4 His severe threatenings
against sin. 5 The dreadful punishments he inflicteth upon sinners. 6 The
heinousness of the sin of presumption, which turns Gods grace into
wantonness. 7 The difficulty of recovery after relapses. 8 The uncertainty of
Gods offer of grace after the frequent refusal thereof.


To keep us in hope, that we dash not upon the rock of despair on the
contrary side, let us set before our troubled and affrighted consciences these
grounds of comfort: 1 The infiniteness of Gods mercy. 2 The price and value of
Christ's blood. 3 The efficacy of his intercession, 4 The virtue of the
Sacraments. 5 The universality and certainty of Gods promises to the penitent.
6 The joy of God and Angels for the conversion of a sinner. 7 The communion of
Saints, who all pray for the comfort of afflicted consciences, and the ease of
all that are heavy laden with their sins. 8 The examples of mercy showed to
most grievous sinners.


Upon these grounds the contrite penitent may build strong forts of comfort
after this manner. My sins though they be more in number than the heirs of my
head, yet they are finite, whereas Gods mercy is every way infinite: if my debt
be as a thousand, my Saviors merits are as infinite millions. And not only
Gods mercy, but his justice also pleads for my pardon: for it is against
justice that the same debt should be twice paid, to require a full ransom from
my Redeemer, and expect it from my self. I ^ Joh. 1.9.
confess my sins, and therefore I know he is faithful and just to forgive
me my sins, and cleanse me from all my unrighteousness. One drop of the
blood of the Son of God was a sufficient price for the ransom of many
worlds, and shall not such store of it spinning from his temples, dropping from
his hands, gushing out of his side, and trickling from all parts of his body,
both in the garden, and in the High Priests Hall, satisfy for one poor soul
that prefers his love even before heaven it self? All my sins are either
original or actual: the guilt of original is taken away in baptism, and as
often as I have received the blessed Sacrament a general pardon was tendered
unto me for all my other sins, and the seal delivered into my hands. What
though God will not hear the prayers of such a sinner as I am? yet he will
hear the prayers of Jesus Christ the righteous, who is the propitiation for my
sins. I acknowledge (to my hearts grief and sorrow) that neither faith nor
hope, nor any other divine virtue bears any sensible fruit in me for the
present; yet the seed of my regeneration remains in me. And as the blind man
knew that his sight began to be restored to him, even by the defect he found in
it when he thought he Mark. 8.24.
saw men walk like trees: so even by this I know that I am not utterly
destitute of grace, because I feel and unfainedly bewail the want of it. If
there were no heavenly treasure in me, Satan would not so often and so
furiously assault me: for thieves besiege not, much less break open those
houses where they are persuaded nothing is to be found. The greater my sorrow
is for my sin, and my spiritual desertion, the greater is my hope: for the
spirit makes intercession for the sons of God Romans 8.26.
with groaning which cannot be expressed. None were cured by the brazen
Serpent, which before had not been stung by the fiery: neither does Christ
promise ease unto any but to those that feel themselves heavy burdened.

But to confine my meditations to the letter of my text. Before ye heard,
Repent you of your sins and you shall surely live. God pawneth his life for
it, therefore despair not how grievous soever your sins be. But now I am to
tell you plainly, if you repent you of your repentance, and turn from
righteousness to sin, and end your days in that state, you shall surely die
eternally: therefore presume not, how complete soever your former
righteousness seem to have been. In these two verses are employed a double
conversion: 1 From evil to good. 2 From good to evil.


To turn from evil, is good; from good, is evil: the former is repentance,
upon which I spent my last discourse: the later is relapse or apostacy,
against which I am now to bend all my forces.

But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits
iniquity, etc. in the transgression which he has transgressed, and in the
sin which he has sinned, in them he shall surely die. The contents of this
verse are like the Prophet Jeremies figs, of which we read that the bad were
exceeding bad; for in the antecedent or forepart we have apostacy, and that
total: and in the hinder part or consequent, death, and that final. The words
divide themselves into (first) a supposition, When, or, if the righteous
forsake: secondly, an inference, his former righteousness shall not be
remembered, etc. The supposition is dangerous, the inference is pernicious.

To establish you in the truth of this supposition, or rather hypotheticall
commination, it will be needful to lay down certain grounds.

1. That the certainty of the end no whit impeacheth the necessary use of all
means for the attaining it. For the end and means are coordinata, and both
involved in the same decree. As the means are appointed for the end, so the
end is decreed to be attained by such means; for example, the propagation of
mankind by marriage, the maintaining our temporal life by food and
sustenance, the recovery of health by physic, the reaping the fruits of the
earth by manuring and tillage, the government of the world by laws, the
calling of men to the knowledge of the truth by the Word and Sacraments, the
keeping the children of God from presumptuous sins by admonitions and
comminations. The heathen themselves saw a glimmering of this truth: for the
Stoicke Philosophers, who taught the foreknowledge of God, and thence inferred
inevitable necessity of all events according to that foreknowledge, yet most
strictly urged the performance of all moral duties and virtuous actions; and
generally, the use of all means for the attaining that end any man proposes
to himself. Be it thy destiny (say they) to have many children by thy wife,
yet thou must not neglect conjugall duties; be it thy destiny to recover of thy
disease, yet thou must not neglect the prescriptions of the Physician; be it
thy destiny to conquer thine enemy, yet thou must not forget to bring thy
weapon with thee into the field; be it thy destiny to be a great Professor
in Philosophy, yet thou must not neglect thy study; be it thy destiny to dye a
rich man, yet thou must not be careless of thy estate.

2. That this and the like comminations in holy Scripture are spoken generally
to all, Elect as well as Reprobate: and they are of special use to both; to
terrify the Reprobate, and keep them within some bounds, or at least to
convince their consciences, and debar them from all excuse at the day of
judgment; and to stir up the Elect to watchfulness over all their ways,
and diligence and constancy in the use of all such means as by Gods grace may
keep them from backe-sliding and dangerous relapses, to hold them in
continual awe, and excite them to make their calling and election sure, and
work out their salvation with fear and trembling, as Saint Austine declares
at large through his whole book de correptione and gratia.

3. That all Israelites are not true Nathaniels, all converts are not
absolutely so, nor all penitents thoroughly cleansed from their sins; many are
regenerated but in part, they repent of their sins, but not of all, they
keep a sweet bit under their tongue, they have a Dalilah in their bosom, or
an Herodias at their table, or a Bathsheba in their bed; though they be healed
of all other diseases, yet not of the plague of the heart, some secret sin
has a kind of predominancy in them. Now as the Peacockes flesh, if it has
but an ordinary seething, grows raw again, cocta recrudescit; and wounds that
are not perfectly healed, though they may be skinned over, break out again,
and bleed afresh; so a man that is not perfectly regenerated in all parts,
though he has a taste of the heavenly gift, and may believe with Simon Magus,
and tremble at Gods judgments with Felix, and hear the Word gladly with
Herod, and do many things; yet because the seed of the word has not taken
deep root in him, it is possible for him with Demas to forsake the Gospel, and
embrace this present world; with Himeneus and Philetus, to make shipwreck of
faith and a good conscience; with Julian to become an Apostata, and a
persecuter of the truth.

4. The Prophet Ezekiel in this place speaks not of Evangelicall
righteousness, but of legal: for he says not simply when a man turns from
righteousness, but from his righteousness. And verse. 5. he defines a just
man to be he That does that which is lawful and right, and has not eaten upon
the mountains, nor defiled his neighbors wife, etc. Now whatsoever may be
alleged for the stability of evangelicall righteousness, and their permanency
who are engraffed into the true Vine, Christ Jesus; daily experience shows
that the most righteous on earth may and sometimes do remit of their strict
observance of their duty; and that it is not only possible, but very facile for
them to let loose the reins to sensual desires, and to follow the gainefull,
or ambitious, or voluptuous courses of the world, at least for a time. For the
way to heaven is up-hill, but the way to hell is down-hill, and thither the
weight of our sinful flesh forcibly tends. -- Facilis discensus averni. A
man may without any pain slip down to the place of everlasting pains and
torments: Yea (says Seneca) a De mort. Clau. Caes. Omnia proclivia sunt,
facile d^scenditur, it^que qu^mvis poda gricus momento temporis pervenit ad
januam ditis.
gouty man may get thither in a trice: Sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere
ad auras,
Hoc opus, hic labor est.
But says the Poet, all the labor is to come back from hell, and get up out
of the deep pit: so he. But the truth is, no labor can work it, no skill
compass it: for from hell there is no redemption. We know there is great
strength required to bend a bow of steel, which will unbend it self, if the
string break or but slip. Our motions to Godward, and proceedings in a
sanctified course of life, are like the rowing of a small boat against a strong
wind and tide (the blasts of the evil spirit, and the propension of our
corrupt nature) much labor and sweat is required, and very little is done with
much ado; and if we sl^cke our hands, and miss but one stroke, we are
carried down with the stream, and cast further back than we can fetch
again with many strokes. Did not Solomon turn away from his righteousness,
and commit iniquity, and do according to all the abominations of the wicked,
when he defiled his body and soul with spiritual and corporal fornication?
Did not David likewise, when he spilt the blood of Uriah, that he might more
freely stay in the bed of Bathsheba? I spare the rest (because I would be loath
with my breath to stain the golden and silver vessels of the Sanctuary) and
come a Thesi ad Hypothesin, from the indefinite to the singular, from the
hearers at large to this present auditory.

Ye hear out of the Text how incommodious and dangerous a thing it is for a
righteous man to degenerate, and turn away from his righteousness; it
depriveth him of all the benefit of his former travells in the way to heaven:
it blasteth all the fruits of his labors, and without a second return to God,
dasheth all his hope of reward, and leaves him in a fearful expectation of
eternal death. I doubt not but that some of you were pricked in heart with
this sharp reproof of sin, which ye heard in the handling of the former
Verses, and ye resolved forthwith to turn from your evil ways, and walk in
the paths of Gods commandments: what remains but that ye hold on your holy
course, to the end that ye may win a garland of the flowers of Paradise?
Beware of turning out of the way, to take up the golden apples which the Devil
casts before you; if ye turn never so little aside, ye endanger your crown
of glory, and hazard your lives.

All your former righteousness which ye have done shall not be mentioned, and
in the trespass that ye have trespassed, and in the sin that ye have
sinned, in them ye shall dye. What a soul and shameful thing is it with the
dog to return to your vomit of luxury, and with the swine to your wallowing
in the mire of sensual pleasures? As in the diseases of the body, so also much
more of the soul, all relapses are dangerous, and in some diseases altogether
incurable: the reason whereof alleged by some learned Physicians is this, that
when we first take our bed the malignity of the disease works upon corrupt
humors in the body, which when they are purged, and we restored to health, if
after by any distemper we fall into the same malady, the malignity of the
disease works upon our vital spirits: in like manner the malignity of sin
before our conversion works but upon our corrupt nature, but after upon the
graces of Gods Spirit. Remember the possessed man in the Gospel, who when the
Luke 11.26.
unclean spirit went out of him returned to his own home, and finding it
swept and garnished, took seven worse spirits than that which before haunted
him, and so his last state was worse than his first. John 8.11.
Sin no more, says our Savior to the impotent man, lest a worse thing
befall thee. (...). Improbe Neptunum accusat, qui bis naufragium fecit. Eras.
Adag.
Lysimachus was wont to say, that it was impardonable carelessness to stumble
twice at the same stone. The first time we offend we may plead ignorance and
oversight: but he that twice runs upon the same rock, if he be cast
away, cannot blame his hard chance, but his retchlesse folly. Tertul. de
poenitent. Comparationem videtur egisse, qui utrumque cognoverit, and judicato
pronunciasse eum meliorem cujus se rursus esse maluerit.
Tertullian acutely observes, that he who after his conversion to God, and
giving his name to Christ, falls again to serve Satan in any vicious course
of life, seems to have put God and the Devil in the same balance, and
having weighed both their services deliberately, and upon a settled judgment,
to have preferred the service of the Devil, and pronounced him the better
Master of the two, whom he the second time chooses to serve after he has made
trial of both. To be overtaken with some kind of temptation or other is the
lot of all the sons of Adam; but when God has delivered us out of the snare
of the Devil, and we have escaped the danger, and undertaken a new course of
life, and held it for some time; then to turn back to the wiles of sin, and
walk of Satan, what is it else than to break all our former promises and
vows made to God? to resist the motions of the Spirit? to strive against
grace? to cast his fear and commandments behind us? and, presuming upon his
gentleness and patience, to run desperately upon the point of his glittering
sword, which he has whet, and threatened to make it drunk with the blood of
all retchlesse and presumptuous sinners? Notwithstanding all these great and
fearful dangers which we incur by relapses, how many turnings do we make in
our way to Heaven? how often do we slack our pace? how often do we unbend
our desires? nay rather fly back like a broken bow? After we have made an
open confession of our sins, and a solemn profession of amendment; after we
have protested against our former courses, and vowed to walk in newness of
life, and taken the holy Sacrament of our Lords blessed body and blood upon it,
yet how soon do we look back to Sodom with Lots wife? how soon do we
forget that in private, which we promised in public? how soon do we leave
the strait paths of Gods commandments, and follow the sent of our former
sinful pleasures? After we have eaten the food of Angels, we devour Satan's
morsels: after we have drunk the blood of our Redeemer, we greedily swill in
iniquity like water. We find in Scripture many desperately sick, yet cured
the first time by our Savior: but where do we read in all the Gospel of any
blind man's eyes twice enlightened? of any deaf ears twice opened? of any tied
tongue twice loosened? of any possessed with Devils twice dispossessed? of any
dead twice raised? No doubt Christ could have done it, but we read not that
ever he did it, that we should be most careful to avoid relapses into our
former sins, the recovery whereof is always most difficult, and in some case
(as the Apostle teaches us) impossible. I tremble almost to rehearse his
words: Heb. 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the
heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the
good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they shall fall away,
to renew them again unto repentance: seeing they crucify to themselves the
Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. For the earth which drinks
in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for them
by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God: But that which brings
thorns and briars is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be
burned. The Plin. not. hist. l. 9. c. 43. Scolopendra hamo devorato omnia
interiora evomit, donec hamum egerat, deinde resorbet.
Scolopendra having devoured the bait, when she feels the hook to prick
her, casts up all that is in her belly till she have got up the hook; but
as soon as ever that is out of her bowels, she suppeth up all that which
before she had cast from her. How excellently has nature in the property of
this fish set before our eyes the condition and manner of a sinner? who after
he has devoured Satan's morsells, feeling the hook in his conscience, and
being pricked with some remorse, rids the stomach of his soul by confession,
and never leaves fasting, and praying, and sighing, and sobbing till the hook
be out, and the wound of his conscience healed with the balm of Gilead; but
that being done, resorbet interiora omnia, he returns to his former vomit,
and greedily gurmandizeth the bait which before he had vomited up. Beloved, is
God bound to help us up as often as we fall carelessly and wilfully? What if he
let us lie as a prey for the Devil, who runs about like a Lion seeking whom
he may devour? Can we promise our selves a continual supply of grace, if we
still turn it into wantonness? Will he believe our sighs and tears, which
have so often proved false ambassadors of our hearts? We see by the fearful
judgments of Ananias and Sapphira how dangerous a thing it is to lie to the
Spirit of God: what do we else when we daily profess in our prayers, that we
are heartily sorry for our sins, that we loath and detest our vicious
courses, that the remembrance of all our former transgressions is grievous unto
us, and the burden of them is intolerable; whereas our deeds testify to the
world, that we are so far from loathing our former filthiness, that we
hunger and thirst after it: so far from hearty repentance, that our heart is
set, and our affections wholly bent to follow wickedness with greediness? Let
us not deceive our own souls, Beloved, God we cannot: so many sins as we
willingly commit after our humble confession and seeming contrition, so many
evidences we give against our selves that we are dissembling hypocrites, and
not sincere penitents: for this is the touchstone of true repentance, it a
plangere commissa, ut non committas plangenda, so to bewail that we have
committed, that we commit not that we have bewailed. I before compared this
life to a sea, and now I may not unfitly most of the fish in it either to the
Scolopendra, of which before, or to the Crab, which either stands still or
swimmeth backward. Do we dream (as Nebuchadnezzar did) of an image with an
head of gold, and arms of silver, and thighs of brass, and legs of earth
and clay? Do we not see many that are gold and silver in their childhood and
youth precious vessels of grace, brass and iron in their riper years, and no
better than earth and clay in their old age? The Plin. lib. 8. c. 16.
Aristoteles tradit Leaenam primo soetu 5. catulos, ac per annos singulos uno
minus, ab uno sterilescere.
Lioness in the natural story, which at the first brings forth five young
ones, and after fewer by one, in a short time becomes quite barren.

But because I have spoken at large of the dangerous antecedent, hear (I
beseech you) a word of the dreadful consequent: All his righteousness that he
has done shall not be mentioned. Would it not vex a Scrivener after he had
spent many days and much pains upon a large Patent or Lease, to make such a
blot at the last word, that he should be forced to write it all again? yet so
it is, that as one foul blot or dash with a pen defaceth a whole writing, so
one soul and enormous crime dasheth and obliterateth the fairest copy of a
virtuous life, it razeth out all the golden characters of divine graces
imprinted in our souls. All our fastings and prayers, all our sighing and
mourning for our sins, all our exercises of piety, all our deeds of charity,
all our sufferings for righteousness, all the good thoughts we have ever
conceived, all the good words we have ever uttered, all the good works we have
ever performed: in a word, all our righteousness is lost at the very instant,
when we resolve to turn from it. As one drop of ink colors a whole glass
of clear water; so one sinful and shameful action staineth all our former
life: yet this is not the worst; for it follows:

In his transgression that he has committed, and in the sin that he has
sinned, in them he shall dye. Does God threaten this judgment only? does he
not execute it upon presumptuous transgressors? When Balthazar took a piece
of the plate of the Sanctuary to quaffe in it, behold presently a Dan. 5.5.
hand writing his doom upon the wall; and in the transgression that he had
committed, and in the sin that he had sinned, in it he dyed. Korah, Dathan,
and Abiram had no sooner opened their mouth against Moses, than the Number. 16.32.
earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up quick, and in the trespass
which they had trespassed, and in the sin which they had sinned, in it they
dyed. Ananias and Sapphira had no sooner told a lie to Saint Peter, and stood
to it, but they were Act. 5.5, 10.
struck down to the ground, and in the trespass that they trespassed, and in
the sin that they sinned, in it they dyed. Herod had scarce made an end of
his oration to the people, and received their applause, crying, The voice of
God, and not of man, when the Angel made Act. 12.22, 23.
an end of him, and in the trespass which he trespassed, and in the sin
that he sinned, in it be dyed. Oh that our blasphemous swearers, and bloody
murderers, and unclean adulterers, and sacrilegious Church-robbers, when the
Devil edges them on to any impiety or villainy, would cast but this rub in
their way: What if God should take me in the manner, and strike me in the
very act I am about, and cast me into the deep dungeon of Hell, there to be
tormented with the Devil and his angels for evermore? Do I not provoke him to
it? Do I not dare him? Has he not threatened as much? Has he not done as
much? Nonne cuivis contingere potest quod cuiquam potest? that which is ones
case, may it not be any ones case? Yea, but they will say, God is merciful.
He is so (else the most righteous upon earth would despair a thousand times)
but not to those that continually abuse his long-suffering, and presume upon
his mercy. If there be Deuteronomy. 29.19, 20.
among you (says God by Moses) a root that bears gall and wormwood, and it
come to pass that when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless
himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the
imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst: the Lord will not
spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke
against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie
upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.

Yea, but God promises pardon at all times to the penitent. But where does he
promise at all times grace to repent? Be it that God would tender us his grace
at what hour we please, which is presumption in us to hope for, yet the
longer we defer the applying of the remedy, the more painful and dangerous
the cure will be. In the conversive proposition concerning our conversion to
God, I admit of the convertens, viz. True repentance is never too late; so they
will take along with them the conversa, viz. that late repentance is seldom
true. Howsoever, what piety is it? nay what equity? nay rather what abominable
iniquity and impiety is it florem Diabolo consecrare, faeces Deo reservare? To
consecrate the flower of their youth to the Devil, the world, and the flesh,
and reserve the lees or dregs of their old age for God? To dedicate to him
our weak and feeble dotage if we live to it, what is it better than to offer
the Deuteronomy. 15.21.
blind and the lame for sacrifice, which God abhors? Repent therefore
repent, repent at the first offer of grace. Ye shall scarce find any precept
of repentance in Scripture, which requires not as well that it be out of hand,
as that it be from the heart: Remember thy Eccles. 12.1.
Creator in the days of thy youth. To Psalm. 95.7, 8.
day if ye will hear his voice harden not your heart. Seek Psalm. 32.6.
the Lord while he may be found. Now he may be found, now he seeks us, now he
calls to us: let us therefore break off all delays, and prick on forward
our dull and slow affections with that sharp and poynant increpation of Saint
Confess. l. 8. c. 5. Modo and modo non habent modum, quamdiu cras and cras? cur
non hoc dic? cur non hac hora finis turpitudinis meae? Ib. Verba lenta and
somnolenta, modo, ecce modo, sine paululum, sed sine paululum, ibat in longum,
etc.
Austine, Why do I still procrastinate my coming unto thee, O Lord? Why not
now? why not this day? why not this hour an end of my sinful course of life?

THE DEFORMITY OF HALTING THE LVII. SERMON.
1 KIN. 18.21. And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt ye
between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow
him: and the people answered not a word.


Right Honorable, etc.
ELijah, who sometimes called for fire from heaven, was himself full of
heavenly fire, the fire of zeal for the Lord of Hosts. His words, like fire, 1
Give light, 2 Heat, 3 Consume.


1 They give light to this undoubted truth, That one, and but one Religion is
to be embraced: either God or Baal must be worshipped, in no case both. Stand
firm to one: How long halt ye between two?

2 They heat and inflame true zeal and devotion: If the Lord be God, follow
him.

3 They burn up indifferency and neutralitie: If Baal be he, go after him.
This passage of Scripture relates a Sermon of Elijah; wherein we are to note
more particularly, 1 The Preacher, Elijah. 2 The Auditorie, the whole
Parliament of Israel. 3 The Text or Theme handled by him, viz. What God is to
be worshipped, what religion to be established and maintained by Prince and
people?


Now although I persuade my self that there is none in this whole assembly who
halteth between the Popish and reformed Churches, or has once bowed his knee
to the Romish Baal: yet because Satan has of late not only turned himself
into an Angel of light, to dazzle the eyes of weak Christians in point of
Doctrine, but also into a Seraphim of heat and zeal, under color of devotion
to bring us to offer strange fire upon Gods Altar; and especially because there
is no lamp of the Sanctuary that burns so brightly, but that it needs oil
continually to be powered into it to feed the flame: the opening of this
Scripture cannot but be seasonable and useful to reduce you into the path, if
you swerve from it never so little; or to prick you on, if you are in the right
way that leads to the kingdom of God. The key to open this Text is the
occasion of this exhortation of the Prophet: wherefore before I proceed to the
exposition of the words, I must entreat you to cast a look backwards to the
occasion of them, and the cause of the peoples haulting downright: a
circumstance not giving more light to the right understanding of the Prophets
reproof, than strength to our steadfast standing, and upright walking in the
high way to Heaven. What the religious Father spoke by way of Apology, for
handling controversall points in the pulpit, Ideo non dubitavimus dubitare, ut
vos non dubitaretis, We therefore make no scruple to move doubts, that ye may
not doubt, but upon the solution of them, be more settled in your most holy
faith; I may say truly, that therefore I hold it needful to make a stay at the
cause of the poeples haulting, that their haulting may be no stay to your godly
proceedings, that you may never hault upon their ground, which was so slipperie
that they slid now this way, now that way, not able to set sure footing any
where. Elijah by his divine commission drew them to Gods Altar; but Ahab,
especially at the instigation of Jezebel, by his royal power enforced them to
offer at Baals groves: between both they were miserably perplexed, their minds
distracted, and their worship divided between God and Baal.

Men are led by examples more than precepts, especially by the examples of
Princes or Potentates, which carry a kind of Sovereigntie over men's
affections and manners, as they themselves have over their persons: insomuch,
that their moral vices, yea and natural deformities also, have been drawn
and patterned out by some of their subjects, as if they were virtues and
graceful ornaments. Jan. Grut. annot. in Tac. (...).
Diodorus Siculus tells us in sober sadness, that it was the custom of the
Aethiopians to maime or lame themselves in that part or foot on which their
Prince limped, because they thought it a great disparagement for their Prince,
that any about him should go more upright, or have a more graceful gate than
he. And Atheneus likewise reports of Dionysius his familiars, that because
himself was somewhat purblinde, they, as they sat at table, reached toward
dishes as it were by aim, and sometimes missed, that they might not seem more
quick-sighted than he. And to make up the number, when Philip received a wound
in his eye, Clisophus, as if he had got a blow on the same eye, puts a
patch on it: and when afterward Philip was run through the right thigh, in
comes Clisophus all to be plaistered on that thigh, and out-halteth his Master.
We can hardly hold laughing when we read or hear of the madness, rather than
folly, of so gross flattery; yet we have cause rather to weep at the sight
of a far worse flattery, and yet most usual, whereby some indeere
themselves into great personages, by imitating their vices and profane
carriage. To express these, they account it a kind of merit of favor, or at
least an homage due to their greatness, because (says Lactant. divin. instit.
l. 5. c. 6. Et quoniam regis vitta imitari obsequii quoddam genus est,
abjecerunt omnes pietatem ne regi scelus exprobrare viderentur. and lib. c. 23.
Homines malunt exempla quam verba, etc.
Lactantius) to imitate the vices of Princes and Nobles, is a Court-complement,
nay a part of the service and obsequiousness due to their persons: all men in
Jupiters time castaway the fear of God, lest they should seem to upbraid
ungodliness to their King. Wherefore no marvel since Ahab was stark lame on
his right leg, that the Israelites here, after the manner of Clisophus,
followed him limping, looking sometimes to Gods Altar, sometimes to Baals. O
the subtlety of the enemy of our souls! how many fetches and turnings has
that wily Serpent to get in his head? if he get it not one way by Atheism, nor
the contrary by Superstition, yet he has a third way, to slide in by
indifferency. Whom he cannot bring to coldness in the true religion, or hot
eagerness in the false, he labors with a soft fire to make lukewarm, as
he did the people of Israel, to whom he suggested these, or the like thoughts.
Alas, what shall we do? we are even at our wits end, our weak and weather
beaten bark is betwixt two rocks, stand still we cannot, the wind is so
strong. If we steer one way, we make shipwreck of our lives and goods; if
the other, of faith and a good conscience: to this straight we are driven,
either we must forsake our religion, or trench upon our allegiance: God and the
King stand in competition. Neither as the matter now stands, is it possible
to serve, much less please both: if we cleave steadfastly to God, we shall be
cloven in pieces, and hewn asunder by Ahab; if we cleave not to him, we
forsake our own mercy, and the rock of our salvation: if we burn incense
to Baal, we shall fry our selves in hell fire; if we sacrifice unto God, Ahab
will mingle our own blood with our sacrifices. We must needs endanger, either
our souls or our bodies, our estate or our conscience. Why, is there no means
to save both? We hope there is, by dividing our selves between God and Baal:
God shall have the one, and Baal the other: our heart we will keep for God,
but Baal shall have our hands and knees at his service: though we visit Baals
groves, Baal shall never come into our thoughts: even then when we offer
incense unto Baal, we will offer the incense of our prayers on the Altar of our
heart to the God of our fathers. By this means we are sure to hold fair
quarter with Ahab, and we hope also to keep in with God, to whom we give the
better part. Yea, but this is no better than halting between both. Be it so,
is it not better to halt, think you, than to lose both legs? And what shame is
it for us thus to halt, since the Prince and chief Priests do no otherwise?
They are our guides, and if they mislead us, let them bear the blame.

As the people thus reasoned with themselves, and after much swagging on both
sides, in the end came to fix and resolve upon this middle way: out comes the
Prophet Elijah, and fearing no colors, presents himself first to Ahab, and
afterward to the people: by Ahab he is entertained with this discourteous
salutation, Art thou he that troubles Israel? How dare thou appear in my
presence? The Prophet as well appointed with patience to bear, as the King
armed with rage to strike, encountreth the King on this wise; It is not I that
trouble Israel, but thou and thy fathers house; in that ye have forsaken the
commandments of the Lord, and have followed Baal. We see here by the freedom
of the Prophets reproof, that though the servants of God may be in bonds, yet
the word of God is not bound; nay it binds Ahab and all his servants to their
good behavior, they cannot stir hand or foot against the Prophet. They are
so far from silencing him, that in Gods name he commands them, saying; Send
and gather unto me all Israel unto Mount Carmel, and the Prophets of Baal four
hundred and fifty, and the Prophets that eat at Jezebels table. The King takes
the word from Elijah, and gives it to the people, and a Parliament is on the
sudden assembled, wherein Elijah is the speaker: his speech is an invective
against unsettled neutrality, and dissembling in matter of religion:
unsettlednesse is taxed in the word halt; indifferency in the words, between
two opinions; dissembling and temporizing in the words following, if the Lord
be God, follow him.

How long halt ye between two opinions? The Prophet here uses no flourish at
all, no prolusion after the manner of Fencers, but presently he falls to
blows, and that so smart, that he stunned his adversaries: for so we read,
they answered him never a word? Cic. Catil. 2. Quousque tandem abutere Catilina
patientia nostra? and Phil. 2. Qu^niam meo f^o fieri dicam P.C. and Muret.
orat. Ergo hoc miseris Gallis? etc.
How long halt ye? An abrupt Exordium becomes a man that is in a vehement
passion: such an one now surprised Elijah; the Baalites profaning Gods name,
polluting his Altars, slaying his Prophets, heat him above his ordinary
constitution. In such a case as this was to have been lukewarm, had been
little better than key-cold. When God is highly dishonored, the true religion
wronged, gross idolatry patronized, not to be moved, is an argument either of
insincerity or cowardice: Patientia digna omni impatientia: Such patience is
insufferable, such silence is a crying sin, such temper a distemper.
Wherefore no marvel if Elijahs spirit, in which there was always an intensive
heat, now flamed, and his words were no other than so many sparks of fire.

How long halt ye between two opinions? Not why? but how? not do ye now? but
how long will ye? not lose or miss your way, or go awry, but halt? not in a
wrong path, but between two ways? How aggravateth the unseemelinesse of their
gate by their manner, long by the continuance, halt by the deformity, between
two opinions by the uncertainty. Is it not a most shameful thing to halt after
an unseemely manner for a long time between two ways, not certain which to
take or leave?

Out of the manner of Elijahs reproof observe the duty of a faithful Minister
of God, when just cause is given to be round with his hearers, and to reprove
them plainly, calling halting halting: if they do not so they halt in their
duty, and the vengeance of God is like to overtake them, denounced by the
Prophet Jeremie; Jer. 23.31, 32
Behold, I will come against the Prophets that have sweet tongues, and say, He
says. Behold, I am against them that prophecy false dreams, says the Lord,
and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies and by their
lightness, yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not
profit this people at all. But because this note sorteth not well with this
time and this queere, I leave it, and insist rather upon those that follow, the
first whereof is the consideration of the time, or rather duration of this
infirmity in the people.

How long? They that are sound in their limbs, may by a small strain or blow
upon their legs halt for a while, but sure long to halt is a sign of some
dangerous spraine or rupture: now this people (as it should seem) halted in
this manner at least three years. The strongest and soundest Christian
sometimes halteth in his mind between two opinions, nay which is worse,
between religion and superstition, faith and diffidence, hope and despair:
but he halts not long, Christ by his word and spirit cures him. As in our
bodies, so in our souls we have some distempers; doubts suddenly arise in our
minds as sparks out of the fire, which yet are quenched in their very
ascending, and appear not at all after the breath of Gods spirit has kindled
a flame of truth in our understanding. Heresies and moral vices are like
quagmires, we may slightly pass over them without any great danger: but the
longer we stand upon them the deeper we sink, and if we be not drowned over
head and ears in them, yet we escape not without much mire and dirt. Hereof
Confess. lib. 3. c. 11. Novem ferme anni sunt quibus ego in illo limo profundi
and tenebris falsitatis, cum saepius surgere conarer and gravius alliderer
volutatus sum.
S. Augustine had lamentable experience during the space of many years, in
which he stuck fast in the heresy of the Manichees: Had I but (says he)
slipped only into the error of the Manichees, and soon got out of it, my case
had been less fearful and dangerous; but God knows that for almost nine
years I wallowed in that mud; the more I strived to get out the faster I
stuck in. Beloved, if we have not been so happy as to keep out of the walk
of the ungodly, yet let us be sure not to stand in the way of sinners, much
less sit in the seat of the scornful: if we are not so pure and clean as
we desire, at least let us not with Moab settle upon the lees of our
corruption: if we ever have halted as Jacob did, yet let us not long halt with
the Israelites, whom here Elijah reproves, saying, How long

Halt ye? It may be, and is very likely that many of the Israelites ran to
Baals groves and altars, and yet they were liable to this reproof of Elijah.
For though we run never so fast in a wrong way, we do no better than halt
before God. Better halt (says S. Austine) in the way, than run out of the way.
This people did neither, they neither ran out of the way, nor limped in the
way; but halted between two ways, and missed both.

Between two opinions. Had they been in the right way, yet halting in it, the
night might have overtaken them before they came to the period of their
journey; but now being put out of their way, and moving so slowly as they did,
though the Sun should have stood still as it did in the valley of Ajalon, they
were sure never to arrive in any time to the place where they would be. Yet had
they been in any way, perhaps in a long time it would have brought them,
though not home, yet to some baiting place; but now being between two ways
their case was most desperate: yet this is the case of those whom the world
admireth for men of a deep reach and discreet carriage: they are forsooth none
of your Simon Zelotes, Ahab shall never accuse them, as he does here Elijah,
for troubling Israel with their religion, they keep it close enough:
whatsoever they believe in private (if at least they believe any thing) they in
public will be sure to take the note from the Srate, and either fully consort
with it, or as least strike so soft a stroke, that they will make no jarre in
the music. Besides other demonstrations of the folly of these men, their very
inconstancy and unsettlednesse convinces them of it: for mutability and often
changing, even in civil affairs that are most subject to change, is an
argument of weakness; but inconstancy in religion, which is always constant
in the same, is a note of extreme folly. Whence it is that the spirit of God
taxes this vice under that name, as, Oh ye foolish Galatians, who has
bewitch^d you? Are ye so foolish? Chap. 3.1, 3, 4.
having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the flesh? Have ye
suffered so many things in vain? And, Ephesians. 4.14.
Be not like children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
doctrine. If religion be not only the foundation of Kingdoms and
Commonwealths, but also of every man's private estate, what greater folly or
rather madness can there be, than to build all the Matthew. 7.26.
security of our present and hope of our future welfare upon a sandy
foundation? He that hears my words and does them not, is likened to a foolish
man which builds his house upon the sand. All the covenants between God and
us, of all that we hold from his bounty, are with a condition of our service
and fealty: which since a man unsettled in religion neither does, nor ever can
perform, he can have no assurance of any thing that he possesses, no
content in prosperity, no comfort in adversity, no right to the blessings of
this life, no hope of the blessedness of the life to come: what religion
soever gain heaven, he is sure to lose it. Whether the Lord be God, or Baal be
God, neither of them will entertain such halting servitours. Were he not
worthy to be begged for a fool, that after much cautiousnesse and
reservednesse, would make his bargain so, that he were sure to sit down with
the loss? such matches makes the worldly-wise man; howsoever the world go,
whether the true or the false religion prevail in the State, while he
continues resolved of neither, he is sure to lose the pearl which the rich
merchant sold all that he had to buy. What shall I speak of inward wars and
conflicts in his conscience? Now he has strong inducements to embrace the
Gospel, shortly after meeting with a cunning Jesuit, he is persuaded by him
that he is an Enfant perdue, out of all hope of salvation if he be not
reconciled to the Roman Church: the next day falling aboard with the brethren
of the separation, he begins to think the Brownists the only pure and
refined Christians; for all other Christians, if we believe them, build upon
the foundation hay and stubble, but they gold, silver, and precious stones.
When he is out of these skirmishes, and at leisure to commune with his own
heart, his conscience charge him with Atheism, indifferency in religion,
and hollow-hearted neutralitie. Add we hereunto the judgment of all
understanding men, who esteem such as double with God, and are of a changeable
religion, to have no faithfulness or honesty. By how much the graces and
perfections of the mind exceed those of the body, by so much the imperfections
and deformities of the one surpass the other: what may we then judge of
wavering inconstancy, which is compared to a spiritual palsy, or an halting
in the mind?

Halt ye. Though the metaphor of halting used in my text might signify either
a slacknesse or slownesse in the way of godliness, or a maime in some member
or article of their faith: yet, according to the scope of the place, and
consent of the best Expositors, I interpret it unsettled wavering and
inconstancy. For he that halteth is like a man of a giddie brain in a
cock-boat or wherrie, who turns the boat sometimes this way, sometimes that
way, not knowing where to set sure footing. The opposite virtue to this vice is
a steadfast standing in the true faith; whereto S. Paul exhorts the
Corinthians, Cor. 15.58.
Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding
in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in
vain in the Lord. And the Colossians, If ye continue in the faith Chap. 1.23.
grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel: and
for it he heartily prays; For this cause I bow Ephesians. 3.14, 16, 17, 18, 19.
my knees to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he would grant you
according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his
spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that
ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all
Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: and to know the
love of Christ which passes knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the
fulness of God. The Pythagorians, who delighted to represent moral truths by
mathematical figures, described a good man by a cube; whence grew the proverb,
Homo undique quadratus, A perfect square man every way. The reason of this
emblem is taken from the uniformitie and stabilitie of this figure, which
consists of six sides exactly equal, and on which soever it falls it lies
steadfast. As the needle in the mariners compass, while it waggleth to and fro
till it be settled and fixed to the North-point, gives no direction: no more
does our faith till it be settled unmoveably, and points directly to the true
religion, which is the only Cynosure to guide our brittle barks to the fair
havens where we would be.

Between two opinions. It is bad to halt, but worse (as I showed before) to
halt between two opinions: which may be done two manner of ways. 1. Either by
leaving both, and keeping a kind of middle way betwixt them. 2. Or by often
crossing from one to the other, and sometimes going or rather limping in the
one and sometimes in the other.


The former is their heinous sin who in diversity of religions are of none,
the latter of them who are of all. The former S. Confess. l. 6. c. 1. Cum ma^^
indicassem non me quidem j^^ esse Mani^^ae^m, sed nec Catholicum Christianum.
Austine confesses with tears to have been his piteous case, when being
reclaimed from the heresy of the Manichees, and yet not fully persuaded of the
truth of the Catholic cause, he was for the time neither Catholic nor
Manichee. Which estate of his soul he fitly compares to their bodily malady,
who after a long and grievous disease, at the critical hours, as they call
them, feel suddenly a release of pain, yet no increase of strength or
amendment: at which time they are in greater danger than when they had their
extreme fits on them, because if they mend not speedily they end. For there can
be no stay in this middle estate between sickness and health. The wise
Lawgiver of Athens, Solon, outlawed and banished all those, who in civil
contentions joined not themselves to one part. How just this Law may be in
Common wealths on earth, I dispute not: this I am sure of, that our heavenly
Lawgiver will banish all such out of his Kingdom, who in the Church civil
wars with Heretics, join not themselves to one part, I mean the
Catholic and Orthodox. The Praetor of the Samnites spoke to good purpose in
their Senate, when the matter was debated whether they should take part with
the Romans against other Greeks, or carry themselves as neuters. Media via
neque amicos patit, neque ini^icos tolli^.
This middle way (says he) which some would have us take as the safest for
us, because thereby we shall provoke neither party, as bolding fair quarter
with both, is the unsafest way of all; for it will neither procure us friends,
nor take away our enemies. Of the same mind was the great Statesman Aristenus,
who after he had weighed reasons on all sides, Romanos aut socios habere, aut
hosts oportere, mediam viam nullam esse. Live. Dec. 4. l. 1. Macedonum legati
Aetolis; s^^o, ac nequi^qu^m cum Do^inum Romanum habebitis, socium Philippum
quaeretis.
resolved that the Romans so peremptorily demanding aid of them as they did,
they must of necessity either enter into confederacy and strict league with
them, or be at deadly fewd; that middle way there was none. Apply you this to
the Roman faith, and it is a theological verity; upon necessity we must
either hold communion with the Roman Church, or professedly impugn her and her
errors. God cursed ^udg. 5.23.
Meros for not taking part with the Israelites against their and Gods enemies:
and Christ in the Gospel openly professes, Matt 12.30.
He that is not with me is against me. Media ergo via nulla est.

The second kind of halting between two opinions, may be observed in those,
who are sometimes of one and sometimes of another. Men of this temper, though
they seem to be nearer health than others, yet indeed they are in more danger;
as the Angel of Apoc. 3.16.
Laodicea his censure makes it a clear case. For though they may seem to be
more religious than they who profess no religion: yet since it is impossible
that truth and falsehood should stand together, all their religion will be found
to be nothing else but dissimulation, and so worse than professed irreligion.
Here that speech of Philip concerning his two sons Plut. Apoph. (...).
Hecaterus and Amphoterus, may have place: Hecaterus is Amphoterus, and
Amphoterus is Udeterus, that is, he whose name is Either of the two, is worth
Both, but he whose name is Both is neither. The Nazarean Heretics (says S.
Austine) while they will be both Aug. de haer. Ad quod vult Deum. 2 Kings 17.
29, 30, 33.
Jews and Christians, prove neither one nor the other. Does zealous Austine
say so only? does not the holy Spirit confirm it, that they who embrace or
maintain more religions are indeed of none? How read we? The people of diverse
nations (says the text) whom the King of Assure planted in Samaria feared the
Lord, but served other gods. Now let us hear the censure of the holy Ghost,
which follows, To this day they do after the old manner: they neither fear
God, nor do after their ordinances, nor after the Law, nor after the
commandment which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob; Fear no other
gods, nor bow to them, nor sacrifice to them. Hence we may strongly infer, that
Ambodexters as they are called, are Ambosinisters, and Omnifidians are
Nullifidians: and that there is no greater enemy to true religion than worldly
policy, which under pretense of deliberation hinders sound resolution, under
pretense of discretion extinguisheth true zeal, under color of moderation
slackeneth or stops all earnest contention for our most holy faith; yet
without contention no victory, without victory no crown. How should they
ever hope to be incorporated into Christ, whom he threateneth to spue out of
his mouth? But I hope better things of all here present, though I thus speak,
and things that accompany salvation, through the sincere and powerful
preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ among you. Cui, etc.

OLD AND NEW IDOLATRY PARALLELED. THE LVIII. SERMON.
1 KINGS 18.21. If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.


Right Honorable, etc.
THe sum and substance of the speech made by the Prophet Elijah before King
Ahab, the Nobles and Commons of Israel assembled on Mount Carmel, is a quick
and sprightly reproof of wavering unsettlednesse, fearful lukewarmnesse, and
temporizing hypocrisy in matter of Religion, which we are steadfastly to
resolve upon, openly to profess, and zealously to maintain even with striving
unto blood, which is gloriously dyed by death for the truth with the tincture
of Martyrdom. How long halt ye between two opinions? etc. This reprehensory
exhortation, or exhortatory reprehension was occasioned by the mammering in
which the people were at this time: the causes whereof I lately enquired into,
to the end that as the fall of the Jews became the rise of the Gentiles; so
the halting of the Israelites between the right way and the wrong, might prove
our speedy running in the race of godliness to the goal of perfection, for
the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. The cause which I then
declared unto you of their halting between two opinions was this: Ahab
(instigated especially by his wife Jezebel, partly by his example, but much
more by furiously brandishing before them the sword reking with the hot blood
of the slaughtered Prophets and servants of the true God) drove them to Baals
groves, where they prostrated themselves before that abominable Idol, and
offered the flames of their Holocausts to the bright beams of the Sun. This
their bowing to Baal, and burning incense to the host of Heaven, so incensed
the God of Heaven, that he barred up the windows of Heaven, and punished their
not thirsting after the water of life, with such a drouth, that not men only
and beasts, but the earth also every where chopped and gasped for some moisture
to refresh her dried bowels, which for the space of wel-nigh three years had no
other irrigation than the effusion of Saints blood. The people thus miserably
perplexed, as being persecuted on the one side by the Prince, and plagued on
the other side by God himself, in the end faint, and yield to the worship both
of God and Baal. The crafty Serpent of Paradise resembles the Serpent called
Amphisbaena, which has two heads, and moves contrary ways at the same time.
For when he could not make them hot in Idolatry by fear, he cools them in
the service of God, and brings them to a lukewarm temper in the true
Religion. At this the Prophet Elijah is exceedingly moved, and put out of all
patience: his fiery spirit carries him first to Ahab, whom he thus charmeth;
It is not I, but thou and thy fathers house that have troubled Israel, because
ye have followed Baalim: after up to Mount Carmel, where meeting with a
Parliament of all Israel, he thus abruptly and boldly sets upon them: How
long halt ye between two opinions? Every word has his spirit and accent: How
long? and halt ye? and between two opinions? It is a foul imperfection to
halt, and yet more shameful long to halt, most of all between two ways, and
miss them both. To be inconstant in civil affairs, which are in their own
nature inconstant, is weakness: but in Religion, which is always constant and
one and the self same, to be unsettled, is (as I proved to you heretofore) the
greatest folly in the world. For he who is not assured of one Religion, is sure
to be saved by none. Yet as massy bodies have some quaverings and trepidations
before they fix and settle themselves, so the most resolved and established
Christian has a time before he rest unmovable in the foundations of the true
Religion; but he is not long in this motion of trepidation, he is not
altogether liable to this reproof of Elijah, How long halt ye between two
opinions? Halting between two opinions may be (as I then exemplified unto you)
two manner of ways, either by limping in a middle way betwixt both, or by often
crossing ways, and going sometimes in one way, sometimes in another.

Against these two strong holds of Satan the Prophet Elijah sets a dilemma,
as it were an iron ram with two horns; with the one he battereth down the
one, and with the other the other. If the Lord be God, then are ye not to stay
or halt as ye do between two religions, but speedily and resolutely to follow
him, and embrace his true worship; but if ye can harbor such a thought, as
that Baal should be God, then go after him. Either Jehovah is God, or Baal is
he, as ye all agree; whether of the two be, it is certain neither of them
likes of halting followers. If God be the Sovereign of the whole world, why
bow ye the knee to Baal? if Baal be he, why make ye supplications to God? why
enquire ye of his Prophets? What Lord soever be God, he is to be followed: if
the Lord be he, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.

I hold it needless to make any curious enquiry into the names or rites of
this Idol; that which way suffice for the understanding of this and other
Texts of Scripture, I find that Baal was the abomination of the Sidonians, a
people of Phoenicia, who (as Ex Rainold. de Romans Eccles. Idolatr. l. 2.
Sanchoniacho an ancient writer of that country, and Herodian a later Roman
Historian affirm) worshipped the Sun, invocating him Beel, or Baal-Samen,
that is in their language, Lord of Heaven. Though this Idol were but one, yet
in regard of the diverse Images set up to it in diverse places, we read of
Baalim, and Baal-Peor, and Baal-Zebub; just (says Ribera the Jesuit) as the
Blessed Virgin, though she be but one, yet she is called by diverse names, taken
from the places where her Images are erected, as namely, she is called
sometimes Lady of Loretto, sometimes of Monte serato, sometimes of Hayles.

But before I come to parallel the Papists and the Baalites, give us leave,
right The Lord Wotton extraordinary Ambassador, and the Lieger Sir Thomas
Edmonds.
Honorable, who are Ambassadors for Christ, to endeavor to imitate that
virtue which is most eminent in men of your place, I mean courage and liberty,
to deliver what we have in commission from our Lord and Master. Ye will say,
what need this preface? what does this Text concern any here? though it be set
upon the tenter hooks never so long, it cannot reach to any Christian
congregation. It were ignorance and impudency to affirm, that any who have
given their names to Christ halt between God and Baal, or offer incense to the
Sun. I hope I may excuse all here present from the sin of the Baalites, and I
would I could also all others, who profess themselves Christians; but that I
cannot do, so long as the whoredoms of the Romish Jezebel are as evident as
the Sunne-beames, which the Baalites worshipped. I find not in Scripture
Idolaters branded chiefly because they were Baalites, but Baalites because they
were Idolaters. If then any who bear the name of Christians may be justly
charged with idolatry, they fall under the sharp edge of this reproof in my
Text, as also do all those who are not yet resolved which Religion to stick
unto, the Romish or the Reformed. Now before we lay Idolatry to the charge of
the Romish Church, it will be requisite to distinguish of a double kind of
Idolatry or Superstition.

1. When religious worship is given to a false god, which is forbidden in the
first precept of the Decalogue.

2. When a false or irreligious worship is given to the true God, which is
forbidden in the second Commandment.

With Idolatry in the first sense we charge them not; for they receiving with
us the Apostles Creed, worship one God in Trinity with us: but from Idolatry in
the second acception they can never clear themselves, but by changing their
tenets, and reforming their practice. For every will worship, or worship
devised by man against or besides Gods commandment, is a false worship: and
what is Popery almost else but an addition of humane traditions to Gods
commandments and his pure worship? What is their offering of Christ in the
Mass for a propitiatory sacrifice for the living and the dead? their elevation
of the host? their carrying it in solemn Procession? their dedicating a feast
to it, called Corpus Christi day? What are their benedictions of oil, salt,
and spittle, christening of Bells and Galleys? What are their invocation of
Saints, Dirges, and Requiems for the dead? going in pilgrimages to the Images
and Relics of Saints and Martyrs, but religious, or rather irreligious rites
brought in by the Church without any command or warrant from Gods Word?
Secondly, other learned Divines distinguish Idolatry into 1. Crassam, a gross
or palpable kind of Idolatry, when the creature it self is worshipped in or
for it self. 2. Subtilem, a subtle and more cunning kind of Idolatry, when the
creature is denied to be worshipped, but God in, by, and through it.
For as the same wool may be spunne with a courser or with a finer thread, so
the same sin specie may be committed after a grosser or more subtle manner.
As for example: he may be said to commit gross murder, who cuts a man's
throat, or chops off his head, or runs him through the heart, and not he who
poysoneth his broth, or his gloves, or his spurs, or his saddle; and yet the
latter is as guilty of murder before God as the former. In like manner, he who
defiles corporally the body of his neighbors wife, may be said to commit
gross adultery, yet he is not free from that foul crime, who lusts after a
woman in his heart, though he commit not the foul act; so we may say, that
he who robs a man upon the highway, or cutteth his purse in a throng,
commits gross theft; yet certainly he that cheateth or couzeneth a man of
his money, is as well a breaker of the eighth commandment as the former: The
same we are to conceive concerning Idolatry forbidden in the second
commandment. For whether it be crassa or subtilis, a worship of the creature
it self, or a pretended worship of God in or by the creature, it is odious and
abominable in the sight of God. For the people that worshipped the golden Calfe
made by Aaron, and the ten Tribes which worshipped the Calves set up by
Jeroboam, worshipped the true God in and by those Images. For Aaron, when he
saw the golden Calfe, built an Altar before it, and made a Proclamation, To
morrow is a feast Jehovae, to the Lord. And Jeroboam (as Josephus testifies)
appointed not that the Calves that he set up in Dan and Bethel should be
adored as gods, sed ut in Vitulis Deus coleretur; but that God should be
worshipped in and by those Calves. Nay the Baalites, who were esteemed grosser
Idolaters than the other, had this plea for themselves, that under the name of
Baal-Samen, the Lord of Heaven, they worshipped the true God, as may be more
than probably gathered out of the words of God by the Prophet Hos. 2.16.
Hosea, And it shall be in that day (says the Lord) that thou shall call me
Ishi, my husband, and shall call me no more Baal: for I will take away the
names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall be no more remembered by their
name. Yet the Scripture styles these Idolaters: 1. Cor. 10.7.
Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written, The people
sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. And God proceeds against
them, as if they were gross Idolaters: for Moses took the Exodus 32.20.27.
Calfe which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and grownd it to powder,
and strawed i^ upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
And he said to the sons of Levi, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Put every
man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the
camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every
man his neighbor. Neither did the ten Tribes after, or the Baalites escape
better: for the Kings of Israel were plagued for their Idolatry, and all the
people led into captivity. And for the Baalites, they were slain with a sword,
and the Temple of Baal made a Jakes.

Here I would not be mistaken, as if I put no difference between an Heathen
and a Papist, an Heretic and an Infidel. For although the Papists in their
transcendent charity exclude Protestants out of all possibility of salvation,
See Wright his motives, That Protestants have no faith, no God, no religion.

deny them to have any Church, any faith, any hope of salvation, any interest
in Christ, any part in God; yet we have learned from the Apostle to render to
no man evil for evil, nor rebuke for rebuke, nor slander for slander: we
deny them not to have a Church, though very corrupt and unsound; we doubt not
but through Gods mercy many thousands of our forefathers, who lived and dyed
in the communion of their Church, and according to that measure of knowledge
which was revealed unto them out of holy Scripture in the mysteries of
salvation, led a godly and innocent life, not holding any error against their
conscience, nor allowing themselves in any known sin, continually asking
pardon for their negligences and ignorances of God, through Christ's merits,
might be saved, though not as Papists, that is, not by their Popish additions
and superstitions, but as Protestants, that is, by those common grounds of
Christianity which they hold with us. All that I intend to show herein is, that
in some practices of theirs, they may be rightly compared to the Heathen: as
when the Apostle says, that he that provideth not for his own family is worse
than an Infidel, his meaning is not, that every Christian that is a careless
householder, is simply in worse state than a Heathen; but only by way of
aggravation of that sin, he teaches all unthrifts that in that particular
they are more culpable than Heathen: In like manner my meaning is not to put
Papists and Heathen in the same state and rank, as if there were not more hope
of a Papist than a Painims salvation; but to breed a greater loathing and
detestation of Popish idolatry and superstition, by paralleling Baalites and
other Heathens together, I will make it evidently appear, that some particular
practices of the Roman Church are no better than Heathenish. See Hom. against
the peril of Idolatry, p. 3.
Of this mind were they who laid the first stones of the happy reformation in
England. Our Image maintainers and worshippers have used and use the same
outward rites and manner of honoring and worshipping their Images, as the
Gentiles did use before their Idols: and that therefore they commit idolatry as
well inwardly as outwardly, as did the wicked Gentile Idolaters.

If any reply, that these Homilies were but Sermons of private men transported
with zeal, and carry not with them the authority of the whole Church of
England: I answer, that as those Verses of Poets alleged by the Apostle were
made part of the Canonical Scripture by being inserted into his inspired
Epistles; so the Homilies, which are mentioned by name in the 35. Article, and
commended as containing godly and His Majesty's declaration: We do therefore
ratify and confrme the said Articles, which do contain the doctrine of the
Church of E^gland, requiring all our loving subjects to continue in the
uniforme profession thereof, and prohibiting the least difference from the said
Articles.
wholesome doctrine, and necessary for the times, are made part of the Articles
of Religion which are established by authority of the whole Convocation, and
ratified and confirmed by the royal assent. Were not this the express
judgment of the Church of England, (whose authority ought to stop the mouth of
all that profess themselves to be her children, from any way blaunching the
idolatrous practices of the Roman Church) yet were not the foreheads of our
Image-worshippers made of as hard metal as their Images, they would blush to
say as they do, that the testimonies which we allege out of Scriptures and
Fathers make against Idols, and not against Image Worship. For the words are,
Levit. 26.1.
Ye shall make no Idol or graven Images, nor rear up any standing Image, nor
set up any Image of stone, to bow down to it. The words are, Exodus 20 4.
Thou shall not make to thy self any Pesel, that is, any thing carved or
graven: And if there may seem any mist in this general word to any, the words
following clearly dispell it, Nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven
above, nor in the earth beneath, nor in the waters under the earth. The third
Text is thus rendered in their own vulgar Latin: Deuteronomy. 4.15, 16, 17.
Take therefore good heed to your souls; for ye saw no manner of similitude
in the day which the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire,
lest peradventure being deceived, Custodite sollicit^ animas vestras, non
vidistis aliquam similitudinem in die qua Dominus vobis locutus est in Horeb in
medio igne, ne forte faciatis vobis sculptam imaginem, vel similitudinem
masculi vel foeminae.
ye make you a graven Image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of
male or female, the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
of any winged foul that flies in the air, the likeness of any thing that
creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath
the earth. Neither is our allegation out of the Prophet Esaias less poignant
than the former: To whom will Esaias 40.18, 19, 20.
ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? The workman melts
a graven Image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and casts
silver chains. He that is so impoverished that he has no oblation, chooses
a tree that will not rot; he seeks unto him a cunning workman, to prepare a
graven Image, etc. As tor the words Imago and Idolum, if we respect the
original, they are all one: for (...) is derived from (...), signifying the
shape or species of any thing: and therefore not only Aristotle calls the
shapes of things, which are received into our senses, the idols of the senses,
but Cardinal Com. in c. 20. Exodus
Cajetan also the images of the Angels in the Arc, Idola Cherubinorum. If we
regard the most common use of the words, they differ as mulier and scortum,
that is, a woman and a strumpet. For as a woman abused or defiled by corporal
fornication, is called a strumpet; so all such Images as are abused to
spiritual fornication are called Idols. Thus Saint Lib. 8. de orig. c. 11.
Idolum est simulachrum, quod humana effigy est consecra^um.
Isidore defines an Idol: An Idol is an Image consecrated in an humane
shape. And at the first all Idols were such, but after men fell into grosser
idolatry, and turned the glory of God not only into the similitude of a Romans
1.23, 24.
corruptible man, but also of beasts, and fowls, and creeping things. The
difference which Cardinal Bellarmine makes between an Image and an Idol
(viz.) that an Idol is the representation of that which has no existence in
nature; but an Image the likeness of something really existent, is false, and
repugnant to Scripture. For the Cherubims in the A^ke were Images, yet never
was there any thing in nature existent in such a form as they were expressed,
viz. in the face of a child with six wings. And no man doubts, but that the
Image which Aaron made, the Nehustan which Hezekiah brake down, Bell and the
Dragon, Rempham, Baal, and Dagon were Idols, and the worshippers of them
Idolaters: yet were these figures the representations of things existent in
nature, viz. of a King, a Beast, a Serpent, a Star, the Sun, and a Fish:
and therefore what arguments the ancient Fathers, Origin, Arnobius, Lactantius,
and Minutius Felix use against the Heathenish Idols, will serve as strong
weapons to knock down and batter in pieces all Popish Images. What a Divin
instit. l. 2. c. 2. Quae igitur amentia est aut ea fingere quae ipsi postmodum
timeant, aut timere quae finxerint? Non ipsos inquiunt timemus, sed cos ad
quorum imaginem sunt facta, and quorum nominibus consecrata sunt: nempe, ideo
timetis quod eos esse in coelo arbitramini. Neque enim si dii sunt, aliter
fieri potest: cur igitur oculos in coelum non tollitis? cur ad parietes, and
ligna, and lapides potius quam illo spectatis ubi eos esse creditis? Hominis
imago tum necessaria videtur cum procul abest, superva^u^ futura cum praes^o
adest: Dei autem cujus spiritus ac numen ubique d^^^^sum a^esse nunquam po^^st,
semper ^^qu^mago supervacan^a est.
madness is it (says Lactantius) either to make that which they ought to
fear, or to fear that which themselves have made? If ye worship the Images
for themselves, ye are more senseless and blockish than they: for they if they
had life and sense as ye have, would not suffer you to worship them, but
themselves would fall down and worship you their makers. But if, as some will
color the matter, ye worship not the Image but God by the Image, why then
lift ye not up your eyes to heaven, where ye know God sits in his majesty?
why cast ye them down? why in offering up your prayers to him turn ye to a
carved stone or painted post? The use of an Image is, to preserve the memory of
those that are dead or absent: therefore since God is always alive and present
with us, his image is always superfluous. And in our devotion to turn to it
is all one, as if a man in the presence of his friend, or a servant in the
presence of his master, having a message to deliver to him-should turn from
him and tell a tale to his picture. And is it not a strange thing that sottish
men should perform such a deal of respect and ceremony to the image? bow
down before it, bring presents, and burn incense to it, and yet all this
while make no reckoning at all of the goldsmith, whose creature it is?

Is not man himself made after Gods image? what an incongruity then were it
for man to think of making or dedicating any other image to God, who is it
himself? What abjectnesse and baseness is it for him who bears the image of
the living God, to cast himself down before, and adore the images of dead men
and women? We read of a barbarous and savage act of a cruel tyrant, who bound
living men to dead carcasses, till the one corrupted the other, and both rotted
together. Is not the cruelty of those Heathen Emperors as barbarous, who
perforce couple the living images of God, the souls of men to dead images, to
corrupt them thereby? Which of these battell-axes is not as serviceable
altogether to knock down Popish Images, as to maule and deface Heathenish
Idols?

And this may suffice for the paralleling of Baalites and Papists in general,
as they are Idolaters: let us now compare them in special.

1. As the Papists plead for themselves, that they worship not Idols, that is,
the representation of things feigned, and devised by man, but images of things
truly existent; so the Baalites might varnish over their idolatry, saying, that
the image they worshipped was not of any feigned deity, but of that which all
men and women saw, which was not only visible, but also most glorious, to wit,
the Sun.

2. As the Baalites stood upon the multitude of Baals worshippers and
ministers: For to one Priest or Prophet of God that durst show his head, they
had above four hundred that followed the Court, and had their table there,
(and albeit indeed there were more than seven thousand in Israel that never
bowed the knee to Baal: yet these played least in sight, and there were more
than seventy times seven thousand in all Israel, that for ought appears,
either willingly or by constraint bowed to him) in like manner the Papists at
this day brag of nothing so much, as of the multitude of their professors, and
paucitie or latencie of those, especially in former ages, that professed the
reformed religion, or impugned the Roman faith.

3. As the priests of Baal called him Baal Samen, King or Lord of heaven, so
do the superstitious Papists call the blessed Virgin the Queen of heaven.

4. As the Baalites erected diverse images to Baal, which received names from
the places where they stood, as Bal Peor, Baal Zephon, Baal Tamar; so have the
Papists erected diverse images to our Lady, which they in like manner denominate
from the cities where they are set up, as the Lady of Loretto, the Lady of
Sichem, the Lady of Mount Seratto, the Lady of Hailes, Nostre Dame de Paris, de
Rouen, etc.

5. As the servitours of Baal were distinguished into ordinary Priests and
Chemarims, who were a peculiar order differing from the rest by their black
habit: so the Romish Clergy is evidently divided into ordinary Priests, and
Monks, and Jesuits, whose coat is of the same color with Baals Chemarims.

6. As the Priests of Baal used vain repetitions of the name of their God in
their prayers, crying, O Baal hear us, Baal hear us, etc. so do Papists in
their Jesus and Ladies Psalters much more often repeat the name of Jesus and
our Lady, and, which I never read of the Baalites, they put a kind of religion
in the number. For ye shall read in the Churches as ye pass by, many
hundred, nay thousand years of pardons liberally offered to all that devoutly
say over so many Pater nosters or Ave Mary's before such an Altar or Picture.

7. As the Priests of Baal used many strange gestures at their Altars,
mentioned ver. 26. so do these at theirs, and some more ridiculous than those
of the Baalites.

8. As the Priests of Baal cut themselves with knives and launcers till the
blood gushed out in great abundance, so these at their solemn processions whip
themselves till they are all bloody.

These things being so, is it possible that there should be any that have given
their names to Christ, and partake with us in the mysteries of salvation, and
seed at our Lords board, should yet bow the knee to the Romish Baal, and so
fall within the stroke of Elijahs reproof, How long halt ye between two
opinions? Should we not much wrong our reformed Church, to surmise there
should be any of her members subject to the infirmity, or rather deformity of
the Israelites here taxed by the Prophet? Had they no means this sixty years
to strengthen the sinews of their faith, and cure their halting? Are there any
that follow Baalim, or, to speak more properly, insist in the steps of Balaam,
and for the wages of unrighteousness will as much as in them lies curse those
whom God has blessed? Are there any that lispe in the language of Canaan, and
speak plain in the language of Ashdod? frame and maintain such opinions and
tenets, as like the ancient Tragedian Buskin (which served indifferently for
either foot, left as well as right) so these, as passable in Rome as Geneva? If
there be any such, I need not apply to them this reprehension of my Prophet,
How long halt ye between two opinions? The dumb beast, and used to the yoke,
has long ago reproved the madness of such Prophets. But I would that this
larum of Elijah still rung in the ear of some of our great Statists, About
this time Doctor Carier, who came over Chaplain with the Lord Wotton, preached
a scandalous Sermon in Paris at Luxenburg house, and not long after reconciled
himself to the Romish Church, and miscarrying first in his religion, and after
in his hope of great preferments by the Cardinal Perons means, in great
discontent ended his wretched days.
who in the height of their policy overreach their Religion, and keep it so in
awe, that it shall not quatch against any of their projects for the raising
their fortunes, or put them to any trouble, danger, or inconvenience. For as
the Heliotropium turns always to the Sun, so they their opinions and
practice in matter of Religion to the prevalent faction in State. As the
cunning Artizan in Macrobius, about the time of the civil war between
Anthony and Augustus Caesar, had two Crows, and with great labor and industry
he taught one of them to say, Salve Antoni Imperator, God save Emperor
Anthony: and the other, Salve Auguste Imperator, All hail my Liege Augustus;
and thereby howsoever the world went, he had a bird for the Conqueror: so
these, if the reformed Religion prevail, their birds note is, Ave Christ,
spes unica: but if Popery be like to get the upper hand, they have a bird then
that can sing, Ave Maria. Strange it is that in the clear light of the Gospel
we should see so many Batts flying, which a man cannot tell what to make of,
whether birds or mice. They are Zoophytes, plant-animals, like the wonderful
sheep in Muscovie, Epicens, amphibia animalia, creatures that sometimes live in
the water, and sometimes on the land, monsters bred of unlawful conjunctions,
which should not see light. If the image of this vice be so horrid and odious
in nature, what shall we judge of the vice it self in religion? I am sure God
can better away with any sort of sinners than these: for these he threatens to
spew out of his mouth.

To close up all. My Beloved, as ye tender the salvation of body and soul,
take heed of this Laodicean temper in religion; if ye ever look to be saved by
your religion, ye must save and preserve it entire and unmixed. Take heed how
ye familiarly converse with the Priests and Chemarims of Baal, lest they draw
you away from the living God to dumb and dead Idols. By no means be brought
to bow the knee to Baal, or give any show or countenance to idolatrous worship:
for God is a jealous God, and will not give any part of his glory to graven
Images. Now the Lord, who of his infinite mercy has vouchsafed unto us the
liberty of the Gospel, and free preaching of his Word, give a special blessing
to that portion which has been delivered to us at this present; plant he the
true Religion in our hearts, and daily water it both by hearing and reading his
Word, and meditating thereupon, that it may bring forth plentiful fruit of
righteousness in us all; strengthen he the sinews of our faith, that we never
halt between two opinions; inflame he our zeal, that we be never cold or
lukewarm in the truth: but in our understanding being rightly informed and
fully resolved of the orthodoxe faith, we may in the whole course of our life
be conformed to it, reformed by it, zealous for it, and constant in it to
death, and so receive the crown of life through Jesus Christ. Cui cum Patre,
and Spiritu sancto, etc. Amen.

Right Honorable, etc.
NOt to suspect your memory, or wrong your patience, by any needless
repetition of what has been formerly observed out of the whole text jointly,
or the parts severally considered: the drift of the Prophet Elijah in this
sprightly reproof, is to excite the King, Nobles and Commons of Israel to
resolution and zeal, in the true and only worship of the true and only God;
and agreeably to this his maine scope and end, he bends all his strength and
forces against those vices that bid battle, as it were, to the former
virtues. These are two: 1. Wavering unsettlednesse opposite to resolution. 2.
Timorous luke-warmnesse the sworn enemy to zeal.


To displace and utterly overthrow them, and establish the contrary virtues in
the soul of every faithful Israelite, is the direct intent of the Prophet:
yet if we consider the assembly before whom he spoke, and the fact ensuing upon
it, viz. the putting Baals priests to the sword, we shall clearly perceive by
the analogy, which is between the state of the whole body politic and the
members thereof, that this text may be applied to the decision of that great
question now in agitation, in this and other Kingdoms, concerning the
toleration of diverse religions in the same State. For as a private Christian
then halteth in judgment, when he wavereth between two religions, uncertain
which to adhere unto: so the whole body of the Commonwealth then seems to
halt between two opinions, when either no religion is by authority
established, or diverse publicly allowed. Besides ye have here in the event
ensuing, upon a motion made by the Prophet Elijah, a notable example to
encourage all zealous Magistrates and Ministers in a good cause, how potent
soever the opposition be. The state of true religion was at this time most
deplorate, and almost desperate in Israel; the Prophets and men of God were
slain, and their ensigns and streamers colored with their blood, the
greatest part of the common soldiers fled treacherously to the enemy: yet when
Religion was even now driven out of the field, God takes part with her, and
miraculously gives her the victory over four hundred and fifty Priests of
Baal, all slain by the people at the command of Elijah.

Toleration of diverse religions falls within the compass of the mysteries of
State, which are fitter to be debated at the Council Table, than determined in
the Schools or Pulpit. I therefore leave it, giving only this premonition,
that in a deliberation of this nature, the reverend Prelates of the Church are
to be of the Quorum. For first it is to be enquired, whether bearing with a
false religion be a thing justifiable by the rules of true religion, and
whether in any case God dispense with tolerating those that worship him
otherwise than he has appointed in his Word; and it being resolved in case of
conscience that some kind of toleration is lawful for some time to prevent a
greater mischief, the Council of State may then securely enquire, whether the
condition of the present state be such, that the only means to suppress
errors and idolatry, is for a while to connive at them. They are also
seriously to consider whether the cockle and darnell be sown so thick and
spread so far, that it cannot be weeded out without the spoil of much good
corn. If the Grecians never undertook any matter of great consequence, before
they received answers from their Oracles: neither the Jews, before they
consulted with God by the Ephod: nor the Romans, before they had the
approbation of their Soothsayers; doubtless all Christian estates are to
expect either a command, or at least a warrant from Scripture, before they
proceed in matters so nearly concerning God and his service: otherwise they go
about to set the Sunne-diall by their watch, not their watch by their
Sunne-diall; to alter the house to the hangings, not the hangings to the house:
whereas all wise Governors, like good Pilots, have manum ad clavum, and oculos
ad astra, their eye upon the stars, and their hand upon the helm, stearing
their course below, by direction from above. But because it better sorteth with
my profession to handle states of controversies, than controversy of State, I
will rather apply this reproof of Elijah, to deter all that travel in these
parts from that dangerous evil and mischief, into which many fall, by seeing
the free exercise of two contrary religions, to wit, either indifferency, or
flat Atheism. For thus the Devil works upon advantage: The Popish religion
is idolatry, as the Protestants demonstrate; The Protestants religion is
schism and heresy, as the Papists teach: therefore you may choose either, or
neither. The Papists refute the Protestants arguments, and the Protestants the
Papists: therefore there is but probality, no certainty either way. This Text
may serve for an antidote against this Laodicean temper. As there is but one
God, so there can be but one true religion: either the Reformed Church must be
in the right, or the Roman; therefore no halting between both. Beware
therefore, dear brethren, of the agents of Rome, who go about to withdraw you
from the love of your Country, your allegiance to your Prince, and which is
worst of all, from the true and pure worship of God. If stealing away the
bodies of your sons and daughters be so heinous a crime, that many conceive
it better to deserve the gallows, than stealing of a horse or sheep, what
punishment do you suppose do they deserve, who steal away their souls from
God, and their hearts from you? If you account them as capital enemies who
seek the ruin of your estate, can you esteem otherwise of them, who seek the
utter ruin and overthrow of your souls? Not. hist. l. 8. c. 59. Quaedam
animalia indigenis innoxia, advenas interimunt; ficut serpents parvi in
Tyrinthe, item in Syria angues, circa Euphratis ripas, Syros non attingunt, aut
si momorderint, non sentiuntur maleficia, aliis cujusque gentis infesti avide
and cum cruciatu exammantes.
Pliny writes of certain Serpents in Tyrinth, and Snakes in Syria, which
never touch the inhabitants, or if they bite them, never hurt them, but sting
foreiners in such sort, that they put them to insufferable pain, and greatly
endanger their life. It may be some may have such an opinion, that the Priests
and Jesuits, and other Papists of their own country, which they meet withal
in these parts, have no will or power to hurt them; and therefore I see many
boldly converse with them, because their outward behavior is fair, and
company delightful: but I beseech them to consider that the Panther hides her
ougly visage, which would terrify any other beast to come near her, that she
may the better allure them by the sweet smell of her body; but as soon as they
come within her clutches, she makes a prey of them. Take heed how ye enter
into the house of Rimmon; ye cannot be present there, but either you must give
great offense, or commit a greater: give great offense if ye do not as they
do, or commit a greater if ye join with them in their superstitious rites.
The Corinthians might not be partakers of such meats as were offered to idols:
may we be partakers of such prayers as are offered to them? It was unlawful
for them to sit at the same table with idolaters when they kept their solemn
feast: can it be lawful for us to stand at the same Altar with them? Beloved,
think again and again upon those fearful menaces, Apoc. 14.9.
If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive the mark in his
forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of
God, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy Angels,
and before the Lamb: and the smoke of their torments shall ascend for ever. And
they shall have no rest day nor night, which worship the beast and his image,
and whosoever receives the print of his name. I dare boldly say that none of
you, my Beloved, have received any print of the beast; ye are yet free from
the least suspicion of familiarity with the Whore of Babylon, ye have kept
your selves unspotted of Popery: wherefore as ye tender your honor and
reputation, nay the salvation of your bodies and souls, keep your selves still
from Idols: be zealous for Gods honor, and he will be zealous for your
safety: abstain from all appearance of that evil, which the spirit of God
ranketh with sorcery and witchcraft. If in your travels you chance to see the
heathenish superstitions, and abominable idolatries of the Roman Church, make
this profitable use thereof; let it incite you to compassionate the blindness
and ignorance of so many silly souls nuzzled in superstition, who verify the
speech of the Psalmist, Psalm. 115.8.
They that worship idols are like unto them, they have eyes and see not the
wonderful things of Gods Law, they have ears and hear not the word of life,
they have hands and handle not the seals of grace, they have feet and walk
not in the ways of Gods commandments. What a lamentable thing is it, to see
the living image of God to fall down before a dead and dumb picture? for men
endued with sense and reason, to worship unreasonable and senseless metal?
wise men to ask Hosea 4.12. My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their
staff teaches them: for the spirit of whoredom has caused them to err, and
they have gone a whoring from under their God.
counsel of stocks and stones? for them who in regard of their souls are
nobly descended from Heaven, to do homage and perform religious services and
devotions to the vilest and basest creatures upon the earth, yea to dust and
rottenness? How much are we bound to render perpetual thanks to God, who
has opened our eyes that we see the grossnesse of their superstition, and
has presented unto us a lively image of himself, drawn to the life in holy
Scripture, an image which to look upon is not curiosity, but duty: to
embrace not spiritual uncleanness, but holy love: to adore not idolatry, but
religion: to invocate not superstition, but piety!

If the Lord be God, follow him. Turn we the Rhetoric of this text into
Logic, and the Dilemma consisting of two suppositions into two doctrinall
positions, the points which I am to clear to your understanding, and press
upon your religious affections, will be these:

1. That there is but one true God: either the Lord or Baal, not both.

2. That this one true God is alone to be worshipped: either Baal must be
followed or Jehovah, not both. But the Prophet will prove by miracle and the
evidence of fire, that Baal is not God, nor to be worshipped; the conclusion is
therefore, that Jehovah the God of Israel is the only true God, and he alone
to be worshipped.

That there is but one true God, is one of the first principles which all
Christians are catechized in: the Decalogue, Lords prayer, and Creed, all three
begin with one God, to teach us, 1. Religious worship of one God. 2. Zealous
devotion to one God. 3. Assured confidence in one God.


At our first Metriculation (if I may so speak) into the Universitie of
Christ's Catholic Church, we are required to subscribe to these three prime
verities, 1. That there is a Deity 1. Above all. 2. Over all. 3. In all.
2. That this Deity is one. 3. That in this Unity there is a Trinity of
persons.


We acknowledge 1. A Deity against all Atheists. 2. The Unity of this Deity
against all Paynims. 3. A Trinity in this Unity against all Jews,
Mahumetans, and Heretics.


Through the whole old Testament this one note is sounded by every voice in
the Quire. We hear it in the Law: Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is Deuteronomy.

one Lord. We hear it in the Psalms: Psalm. 18.31.
Who is God but the Lord? We hear it in the Prophets: Hosea 13.4.

2.10.
Have we not all one father? has one not God created us?

The new Testament is as an echo resounding the same note; Ephesians. 4.5, 6. 1 Timothy 2.5.
One Lord, one faith, one baptism. One God and father of all, who is above
all, and through you all, and in you all. For there is one God, and one
Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. And, This is John 17.3.

rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of
heaven: and likewise in the Psalms, Psalm. 110.1.
The Lord said to my Lord: yet S. Athanasius in his Creed resolves us, there
are not more Gods, or more Lords, nor more eternals, nor more
incomprehensibles, but one eternal and one in comprehensible. In the mystery
of the Trinity there is alius and alius, not aliud and aliud: on the
contrary, in the mystery of the incarnation of our Lord and Savior, there is
not alius and alius, but aliud and aliud; in the one diversity of persons in
one nature, in the other diversity of natures in one person. Sol quasi solus.
God is, as Plato styles him, the Sun of the invisible world: and it is as
clear to the eye of reason that there is one God, as to the eye of sense that
there is one Sun: for God must be sovereigne, and there cannot be more
sovereignes. The principles of Metaphysick laid together demonstrate this truth
after this manner; There is an infinite distance between something and
nothing: therefore the power which brings them together, and makes
something, nay all things of nothing, must needs be infinite: but there cannot
be more infinite powers, because either one of them should include the other,
and so the included must needs be finite; or not extend to the other, and so
it self not be infinite.

Out of natural Philosophy such an argument is framed; Whatsoever is either
has a cause of its being, or not: if it has a cause of its being, it cannot
be the first cause; if it have no cause of its being, it must needs be the
cause of all causes. For there cannot be an infinite process from causes to
causes, which nature abhorres; therefore we must needs come to one first cause
that sets all on working, and it self depends upon no other former cause.
This truth the Poets fitly resembled by a golden chain upon which heaven and
earth hang, whose uppermost link was fastened to Jupiters chair.

The moral Philosophers also yield a supply of their forces to aid this truth.
There can be but one chief good (say they) which we desire for it self, and
all other things for it; but this must needs be God: because nothing but the
Deity can satisfy the desire of the reasonable soul, and because in the
highest and chiefest of all good, there must needs be an infinity of good,
otherwise we might conceive a better and more desirable good; now no infinite
good can be conceived but God.

Neither is it a weak pillar wherewith the Statesman supporteth this truth,
Nulla fides regni sociis, omnisque potestas
Impatiens consortis erit.


No one Kingdom can stand, where there are two Bod. de rep. l. 2. c. 20. De
vnius dominatu.
supreme and uncontrollable commanders: therefore neither can the whole world,
which is a great Empire or Kingdom, be governed by two or more supreme
Monarchs. This argument may be illustrated by the fact and apophthegme of the
Grand Seignior, who when his son Mustaphas returning from Persia was received
and entertained with great shouts and acclamations of all the people, he
commanded him presently to be slain before him, and this oracle to be
pronounced by the Priest; Unus in coelo Deus, unus in terris Sultanus: One God
in heaven, one Sultan on the earth. Lact. divin. institut. l. 1. c. 5 Adeo in
unitatem universa natura consentit.
Lactantius also harpeth upon this string, There cannot be many masters in one
family, many Pilots in one ship, many Generals in one army, many Kings in one
Realm, De Ira Dei, cap. 11. Non possunt in hoc mundo multi esse rectores, nec
in una domo multi Domini, nec in una nave multi gubernatores, nec in uno regno
multi reges, nec in uno mundo multi soles.
many suns in one firmament, many souls in one body; so the universalitie of
things runs upon an unity. These and the like congruities induced the
greater part of the heathen Sages to assent to this truth. Mercurius
Trismgeistus gives this reason why God has no proper name, because he is but
one, (...). Orpheus calls God the one true and first great begotten, because
before him nothing was begotten, whose nature because he could not conceive, he
says he was borne of immense air.

(...). Pythagoras terms him Animam mundi; and Anaxagoras, Mentem infinitam;
Seneca, Rector of the whole world, and God of heaven and all gods. Tully and
Plato were confessors of this truth, and Socrates a Martyr of it: but,
Beloved, we need not such witnesses: for we have the testimony of those three
that bear record in heaven; of God the father, I am God, and there is Esaias
46.9.
none other; of God the son, this is John 17.3.

Jesus Christ; of God the holy Ghost, O Lord there is 1 Chronicles. 17.20.

is but one God the father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and one
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. This point is not
more clear in the proof, than profitable in the use: which,

1. Convinces the error of the Manichees, who taught there were two Gods: and
of the Tritheites, who worshipped three: and of the Greeks, who multiply their
Gods according to the number of their cities: and of the Romans, Qui cum
omnibus gentibus dominarentur omnium gentium servierunt erroribus: who when
they had subdued all nations, made themselves slaves to the errors of all.
There was no star almost in the sky, no affection in the mind, no flower in
the garden, no beast in the field, no thing almost so vile and abject in the
world, which some of the Heathen deified not; Omnia colit error humanus praeter
eum qui omnia condidit.

This Unity of the Trinity infers a Trinity of Unity, Viz. 1. Of faith. 2.
Baptism. 3. Charity.


The two former the Ephesians. 4.5.
Apostle infers in that verse, wherein he declineth, (...): surely there
can be no verity of unity, where there is no unity of verity. If there be but
one God, then the worship of him must needs be the only true religion; if
there be no name under heaven by which we may be saved, but the name of Jesus
Christ, Acts 4.12.
it insueth hereupon, which serves wonderfully for our everlasting comfort,
and the terror and confusion of all Infidels, that only the Christian can be
saved. The Poets fained that the way to heaven was via lactea, a milkie way:
but the Scripture teaches that the only way thither is via sanguinea, not a
milkie, but a bloody way, by the cross of Christ.

3. From unity of faith and Sacraments there follows a third unity, to wit,
the unity of love. For how can they be but united in love, who are members of
one mystical body, and quickened by one and the self same spirit? The nearest
and strongest tie among men is consanguinity: how near and dear ought then
all Christians to be one to another, who are not only made all of one blood,
as all men and women are; but also are redeemed by one blood, the blood of
Christ, and participate also of one blood in the Sacrament? Where the union is
or should be firmer, the division is always fowler: how then comes it to
pass, that as in the Church of Corinth one said, 1 Cor. 1.12, 13.
I am of Paul, another said I am of Apollo, another I am of Cephas: so in our
Church one says, I am of Luther; another, I am of Calvin; another, I am of
Zwinglius? Is Christ divided? Is the reformed religion deformed? Is not this a
cunning sleight of Satan to divide us one from another, that so he may prevail
against us all, as Horatius did against the Curiatii: the manner whereof Decad.
1. l. 1. Conserus manibus cum non motus tantum corporum agitatioque anceps

Livie describes at large, it being agreed by both armies of the Romans and
the Albans, for the sparing of much bloodshed, to put the trial of all to the
issue of a battle between six brethren, three on the one side the sons of
Curatius, and three on the other side the sons of Horatius: While the Curatii
were united, though they were all three sorely wounded, they killed two of the
Horatii; the third remaining, though not hurt at all, yet finding himself not
able to make his party good against all three, begins to take his heels, and
when he saw them follow him slowly one after the other, as they were able, by
reason of their heavy armor and sore wounds: he falls upon them one after
another, and slayes them all three. When Cyrus came near Babylon with his
great army, and finding the river about it, over which he must pass, so deep,
that it was impossible to transport his army that way, he suddenly caused it to
be divided into many channels, whereby the maine river sunk so on the sudden,
that with great facility he passed it over and took the city. That maxim
in Philosophy, Omne divisibile est corruptibile, holds in all States and
societies. After the Donatists had made a faction in Africa, as they brake the
unity of the Church, so they were broken themselves into diverse fractions: and
so in a short space came to nothing. The division among the Trojans brought in
the Grecians, the divisions among the Grecians brought in Philip, the division
of the Assyrian Monarchy brought in the Persian, of the Persian brought in the
Macedonian, of the Macedonian brought in the Roman, of the Roman brought in the
Turk. Lastly, the division among the Britains of this nation, brought in
first the Saxons, next the Danes, and last of all the Normans: So true is the
axiom of our Savior, A kingdom divided against it self cannot stand. The
barbarous Soldiers, beloved Christians, divided not Christ's coat, shall we
rend and tear asunder his body by schism and faction? The lines, the nearer
they come to the center, the nearer they are one to another: we cannot be one
with God, so long as we are thus divided one against another. I conclude as the
Orator does his oration upon the answers of the Soothsayers. When upon the
news of earthquakes and other prodigious signs, the Soothsayers foretold
great calamities were likely to befall the State, unless the wrath of the gods
were suddenly appeased; the Orator determines the point most divinely, Cic.
de arusp. resp. Faciles sunt deorum irae; nostrae sunt inter nos irae,
discordiaeque placandae.
God will be easily reconciled to us, if we be reconciled one to another. If we
be at peace one with another, Beloved, God will soon be at peace with us; and
if God be at peace with us, all creatures shall be in league with us, and
neither Devil, nor man, neither any thing else shall have any power to hurt
us. So be it. Deo Patri, etc.

BLOODY EDOME. THE LX. SERMON.
PSALM. 137.7, 8. 7. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edome, in the day of
Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it even to the foundation thereof.

8. O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed: happy shall he be that
rewards thee, as thou have served us.


Right Honorable, etc.
WHat a storm is in the sky, that a vehement passion is in the mind; it
darkeneth, it stirs and troubles it, and after fearful crackes it
resolves in the end into a sad shower: such a violent perturbation seized at
this time on the minds of the exiled Jews in Babylon, when the insolent
Conquerours, adding affliction to their affliction, and gall to their wormwood,
in a flouting and jeering manner called for their Hebrew songs and melody in
that their heavy and doleful estate. What so unseasonable as to require a man
to sing pleasant songs, when his very heart strings are broken with grief?
What so lamentable and pitiful, as not to be pitied in greatest misery? nay to
be insulted upon and laughed at? Wherefore what with a longing desire of their
country, and sorrow for their loss of it: what with zeal for the Lords
honor, and the glory of Sion: what with indignation against such savage and
barbarous usage, the people of God over-cast as it were with a black and
dismal cloud, partly break out into direful execrations, like thunder and
lightening, ver. 7, 8, 9. partly vent their grief in sighs, ver. 4, 5, 6.
partly resolve it into a shower of tears, ver. 1. Edome is blasted as it were
with lightening for her wicked words, ver. 7. and Babylon is struck with a
thunderbolt for her cruel deeds against Gods People, City, and Temple, verse.
8, 9. Edome shall be remembered for the mischievous counsel he gave; and the
daughter of Babylon shall be for ever razed out of memory, for razing Jerusalem
to the ground. And let all the secret and open enemies of Gods Church take heed
how they employ their tongues and hands against Gods secret ones: they that
presume to do either, may here read their fatal doom written in the dust of
Edome, and ashes of Babylon. Plin. ^at. hist. l. 21. c 4 Rosa siccis quam
humidis odoratior, omni recisione atque ustione proficit, translatione quoque
ocyssime.
Roses lose not their natural smell by transplantation, but (as Pliny
observes) grow more fragrant thereby. It is so with men, the natural
affection they bear to their country is rather increased than decreased by
peregrination; as the sighs which the captive Jews breathe out in this
Psalm, and the plentiful tears which they shed by the waters of Babylon, may
be abundant proofs unto us. As they walked in the pleasant fields about
Babylon, they think of the lamentable estate of their own Country, and the
ruin of their City and Temple, which cast down their countenance, and drew
abundance of tears from their eyes, sighs from their heart, and prayers from
their mouth for Babels Babel, that is, the confusion of the Babylonians, who
neither spared City nor Temple, but sacked and razed both down to the ground.

This is the ground upon which the Psalmist sweetly runs through the whole
Psalm: wherein four things are particularly descanted on;

1. The grievous affliction of Gods people, who were banished their native
soil, and by the waters of Babylon sat down and wept.

2. The inhumane cruelty of the Babylonians, who not content to banish them out
of their native country, endeavored also to banish all natural affection out
of their minds, requiring from them light and merry songs in this their great
heaviness.

3. The zealous affection of the people toward their Country.

4. Their effectual prayer to God against their enemies the Edomites, as the
instigators of the siege and sack of Jerusalem; and the Babylonians as the
chief actors in that bloody Tragedy.

Remember the children of Edome, etc. We have in these words, 1. A patheticall
imprecation. 2. A prophetical denunciation.


Edome is accursed, Babylon is sentenced; the one for advising, the other for
committing outrage upon Gods people. Nothing will satisfy their malice and
cruelty but a glut of blood, and massacre of Gods Saints, and razing the holy
City again and again if it were possible to a second foundation.

In the patheticall imprecation note we particularly, 1. The curse it self,
Remember. 2. The parties accursed, The children of Edome. 3. The cause why they
are accursed, their words steeped in the gall of malice, Down with it, down
with it to the ground.


Likewise in the prophecy against Babylon observe, 1. Her title, Daughter of
Babylon. 2. Her judgment, Which art to be destroyed. 3. Her sin, employed in
those words, As she has served us.


Remember. Remembrance is the calling to mind of such things as before we had
forgot, or at least put by and laid aside for the present. God therefore, who
at once apprehends all things past, present and future, cannot be properly
said to remember any thing; yet by a figure he is said to remember his
covenant, when he performs the conditions on his part: to remember his
children, when he rewards them for their obedience: and to remember his
enemies also when he repayeth unto them the works of their hands. The good
thief takes the Word in the good sense: Luke 23.42.
Lord, remember me when thou come into thy Kingdom. And David, Psa. 106.4,
5.
Remember me, O Lord, with the favor thou bear thy people: O visit me
with thy salvation, that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice
in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. But
the Jews here take the words in the worst sense; Remember the children of
Edome, that is, think upon them according to their deserts. There is a
precious balm that breaks the head, and the soft drops pierce stones; even
so the mild and meek prayer of Gods people here against their unnatural
brethren the Edomites pierced the heavens, and prevailed with him that is
omnipotent. God remembered his peoples just complaints, and the Edomites paid
for it. Thus if we would remember the words of God, Romans 12.19. Heb. 10.30.
Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord; and when we are wronged in
the highest degree, commit our cause to him, and not to vow, threaten, or
practice our own revenge: God would certainly right us in due time. Are we
not brethren? If then we have hard measure offered unto us, why do we not
complain to our heavenly Father? Why do we not power out our groans into
his bosom either in the words of Brutus, Plut. in vit. Brut.
(...)? Or rather in the words of David, Psalm. 35.1.
Plead thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me, fight against
them that fight against me? Or of the slain under the Altar, Rev. 6.10.
How long, O Lord holy and true, do thou not judge and avenge our blood on
them that dwell upon the earth?

Yea, but ye may object, Is not this Remember here an imprecation or a curse in
words as smooth as oil, and yet in the sense as sharp as swords? What then?
may the children of blessing curse? Is not cursing accursed by the Prophet? His
Psalm. 10.7.
mouth is full of cursing. As he loved Psalm. 109.17.
cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delights not in blessing, so let it
be far from him. Are not curses fitly compared to arrows shot bolt upright,
which fall down upon the head of him that draws the bow? Does not our blessed
Savior command us to Mat. 5.44.
bless them that curse us? And does not the Apostle repeat it again and
again for fear we should forget it, Romans 12.14.
Bless them that persecute you, bless (I say) and curse not? Are not cursed
speakers sharply censured by the Apostle, and ranked among the greatest
sinners? Romans 3.13, 14.
Their throat is an open sepulcher, with their tongues they have used deceit:
their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed
blood.

The resolution of this doubt consists in a distinction of the 1. Parties, 1.
Cursing. 2. Cursed.
2. Cause.


Saint Austine allows of no cursing by malediction, but prophetical
prediction. Peter Martyr puts a great difference between cursing, which
proceeds from a sense of our private wrong, and that which breaks out of zeal
for Gods honor when his name is blasphemed, or his kingdom opposed, and truth
scandalized. Men (says he) may not curse carnali affectu, out of a carnal
affection: but it is another thing, cum aguntur Spiritu Dei; when they are
moved thereunto by the Spirit of God. He distinguishes also of temporal and
eternal evils, and he is of opinion, that in some case temporal evils may
be wished to our enemies, because they may turn to their good; but in no wise
eternal. Pareus having distinguished of humane imprecations and divine, and
subdivided these either into immediate or mediate, determines, that observing
some conditions, we may without sin curse some kind of men.

What we may safely build upon in this question, I will lay down in three
assertions.

1. Men that have the gift of Prophecy may curse the enemies of God and his
truth, not only in general, but also in particular: as David does Psalm. 69.25.
Acts 1.20.
Judas, Peter Act 8.2, 20.
Simon Magus, and Paul the high Act. 23.3.
Priest. For this kind of cursing is not properly malediction, but prediction;
neither is it spoken voto optantium, sed spiritu prophetantium, as Saint
Austine teaches us to distinguish.

2. Men endued with ecclesiastical power may pronounce Anathema's, deliver to
Satan, and curse obstinate heretics and contemners of ecclesiastical
discipline. For this is jus dicere, not maledicere; an act of power, not
impotent affection; of censure, not revenge. Howbeit, the Church must be
sparing of these thunderbolts of execration and excommunication, remembering
always that this power is 2 Cor. 10.8.
given to them for edification, not for destruction. For it is most true, that
the Athenian Priest answered to those that would have had her curse Alcibiades:
Priests (says she) are appointed to bless, not to curse; to pray for people,
not against them. Notwithstanding if the Church meet with a Simon Magus, set in
the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity: or an Elymas, that will not cease
to pervert the right ways of God: or an Alexander that mightily withstandeth
the preaching of the Gospel; she may brandish the sword of the Spirit, and cut
such off from her visible assemblies for a time, till they make their peace
with God by repentance, and with the Church by confession and humble submission
to her sacred Canons.

3. Men neither inspired by God, nor authorized by the Church, yet may and
ought to pray against the kingdom of Satan and members of Antichrist in
general, and all whosoever stop the free passage of the Gospel, or hinder the
advancement of Christ's Kingdom. For we cannot love God, but we must needs love
them that love him, and hate them that hate him, even with a perfect hatred. As
we must bless them that bless him, so we may and ought in general to curse
all that curse him. In war we may aim at the Standard, and shoot at the
Flagge and Ensigns; but it is against the law of arms to level at any
particular man: in like manner we may shoot out of zeal fiery darts of
execration at the Standard of Satan, and level at the Flagge and Colors of
Antichrist; but we may not curse or doom to the pit of hell such a nation,
city, assembly, or man in particular.

1. Because God only knows who are his: he that is now a great persecuter, or
a scoffer at the truth, may be in time a zealous professor; and it is a
fearful thing to curse the children of blessing.

2. Because it is very difficult, if not impossible for any in this kind to
curse, but that malice and desire of revenge will mingle themselves with our
zeal, and thereby we shall offer with Nadab and Abihu strange fire.

3. Because we are commanded to pray for our enemies, who the more they have
wronged us, the more they stand in need of our prayers. For the greater injury
they offer us, the more they hurt themselves: they wound us in body, but
themselves in soul: they spoil us of our goods, but they deprive themselves
of Gods grace: they go about to stain our good name, but by detraction and
false calumniation they worse stain their own conscience: they may work us
out of favor with Princes and great men, but they put themselves out of favor
with God thereby.

Ye hear how execrable a thing cursing and execration is, and yet what so
common? I tremble to rehearse what we hear upon every slight occasion. O
remember from this Memento in my Text, that unless ye were inspired as the
people here were, and knew that those whom ye curse were hated of God, as
these Edomites were, by cursing others ye incur a curse, and by casting
firebrarnds of Hell at your brethren, ye heap hot burning coals upon your
heads. And so I pass from the curse to the parties cursed:

The children of Edome. The Edomites or Idumeans were of the race of Esau,
Jacobs elder brother, who coming home hungry from hunting, and finding his
brother seething pottage, grew so greedy of it, that he bargained with him for
a mess at the dear rate of his birthright. This red broth bought at such a
price, was ever after cast in Esau his dish, and from it he was called Genesis
25.30, 31, 32, 33.
Edome, and all his posterity Edomites or Idumeans, as if ye would say, red or
bloody ones. Such was their name, and such were they: a bloody generation, of
the right blood of Esau. For as he sought the life of his brother Jacob, so
they ever plotted the ruin and destruction of the Jews their brethren; and in
the day of Jerusalems fearful visitation, when the Babylonians had taken the
City, and put all in it to the sword, and robbed the Temple, and ransacked all
the houses, and left nothing but the wall, their unnatural brethren the
Idumeans in stead of quenching, or at least allaying the fury of the
Babylonians by their prayers and compassionate tears, cast oil into the
flame, and set them in a greater rage against them, and instigated them to a
further degree of cruelty, even to pull down all the houses, and sack the
walls, saying, Raze it, raze it to the ground. For which their inhumane and
savage cruelty against the Church of God, God remembered them in due time, and
rewarded them as they had served their brethren, to fulfill the prophecies of
Jer. 49.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Jeremy and Obadiah: Obad. ver. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
For thy cruelty against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee. In the day
that thou stoodest on the other side; in the day that the stranger carried away
captive his forces, and forreiners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. But thou should not have looked on
the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger, neither should
thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction:
neither should thou have spoken proudly in the day of their distress.
Neither should thou have stood in the cross ways, to cut off those of his
that did escape, neither should thou have delivered up those of his that did
remain in the day of distress. For the day of the Lord is near upon all the
heathen: as thou have done, so it shall be done unto thee, thy reward shall
return upon thine own head. Behold a notable example of divine justice in
meting to the wicked their own measure, and punishing them with that where
with they offended. The Edomites proved false to the Jews their brethren, and
their nearest friends prove false to them: They received a wound (ver. 7.) from
the men of their confederacy, even from them that ate their bread: Non
expectato vulnus ab host ferunt.

Remember, O Lord, the Edomites, but destroy the Babylonians. Though the
Edomites dealt most cruelly with their brethren the Jews, yet the Jews are
not so far transported with passion against them, as not to put a difference
between them and the Babylonians. By the way we may note the condition of
Christ's dearest Spouse in the world: both Edomites and Babylonians, foreign
and domestical enemies, those that are near, and those that are far off
conspire against poor Jerusalem, and bring her (as you see) upon her knees,
crying to heaven for revenge, and by the spirit of prophecy promising Cyrus
good success in his enterprise against Babylon.

O daughter of Babylon, that is, City of Babylon, by an elegant Hebraisme; as
tell the daughter of Sion, that is, tell Sion. We read of a twofold Babylon in
sacred Scriptures, of the one in the Old Testament, the other in the New: the
one proper and material, the other figurative and mystical: the one the seat
of Nebuchadnezzar, and the Emperors of Assyria, the other the seat of
Antichrist: the on situate by the great river, by whose banks the Israelites
sat down and wept, the other sitting upon many waters, that is, as the Angel
expounds it, many Apoc. 17.15.
peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues: the one keeping the bodies
of Gods people, the other their souls in captivity and bondage. This latter
not only the ancient Fathers, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Saint Jerome, and Saint
Austine, but also the Jesuits themselves, Ribera, Vegas, and Bellarmine put
upon the rack, and sorely tortured with the arguments of Protestants, confess
to be Rome. For the Whore of Apoc. 17.18.
Babylon is said to be the great City, which reigns over the Kings of the
earth: and ver. 17. She is said to sit upon a beast, having seven heads, which
are seven hills, ver. 9. Now there was no City in the world which ruled over
the Kings of the earth at that time when St. John wrote but Rome: neither was
there any place so famously and generally known by any mark as Rome by the
seven hills upon which it is built; which is therefore called septi-collis
urbs, and her inhabitants in Tertullians time septem collium plebs, and the
chiefest feast which they kept in December upon those seven hills,
septi-montium. What of all this will some Papists say? let the daughter of
Babylon be the mother of fornications, let the speech of Saint Aug. l. 18. de
civit. Dei, c. 20. Rom^ altera Babylon, and prioris filia. Ibid. Vives in
comment. Hieronym. epist. ad Marcellam. Non aliam existimat describi a Johanne
in Apocalypsi Babylonem, quam urbem Romam.
Austine be as true as it is elegant, Babylon quasi prima Roma, Roma quasi
secunda Babylon, what will ensue hereupon? nothing but this, That the Pope is
Antichrist. This consequent cannot be avoided by their usual distinction of
ancient and new Rome, Heathenish and Christian, Imperial and Papal: for Saint
John speaks of Rome in her later time, when Antichrist should sit in her,
when Babylon should fall, and be broken into ten pieces, or kingdoms: which
was not fulfilled in the reign of the Heathen Emperors; and therefore must be
accomplished in the reign of Popes, who are the seventh head of the Beast,
that is, the seventh form of government of that City. Five were fallen in
Saint John's time (viz.) Kings, Consuls, Tribunes, Dictators, Decemvirs: the
sixth was upon it (viz.) the head of Emperors; the seventh was to rise up
(viz.) the head of Popes.

But because ye may suspect, that out of prejudicate opinion against the Pope,
we wrest these Sciptures against the Sea of Rome, I will bring in all my
evidence at this time against the Pope out of the writings of the ancient
Fathers, who cannot be thought to deprave Scriptures out of an ill affection to
Rome. For they then honored and highly esteemed the Church of Rome, as a
principal member of Christ's Spouse: yet even then they conceived that she
would in time become the Whore of Babylon. For Irenaeus calculating the number
of the Beast 666. makes of it this word, (...), The name of Latinus (says he)
contains the number 666. and is very likely to be the name of the Iren. l. 5.
adv. haer c. 30.
Beast: for they are the Latins that now reign. And Tertullian ghessing at
the time of Antichrists rising, says, Tertul. de resurrect.
Romani Imperii abscessio in december reges divisi, Antichristum superinducit; The
decay of the Roman Empire being divided into ten kingdoms, shall bring in
Antichrist. Saint Ep. ad Algas.
Jerome strikes nearer the Popes triple crown: The purple Whore is Rome, and
her name of blasphemy is, Roma aeterna. Saint Ep. ad These. Vacantem Imperii
principatum invadet.
Chrysostom expressly affirms, that Antichrist his throne shall be the vacant
seat of the Roman Empire. Saint Greg. ep. l. 4. Sacerdotum ei paratur
exercitus.
Gregory seems to have received some particular advertisement of the approach
of the man of sin in his days: Antichrist (says he) is setting forth, and
an army of Priests is levied for him. Lay all these particulars together, and
the total sum will be, that the Pope is Antichrist. The name of Antichrist
is Latinus, his seat is Rome, his rising is upon the fall of the Empire, his
guard is an army of Priests. Saint Gregory implies that Antichrist shall be a
Bishop. P. Mouline contr. Coeffet. part. 3. Accomprirement des prophecies.
Irenaeus that he shall be a Latin, or of the Latin Church. Saint Jerome that
Rome shall be his See. Tertullian and Chrysostom, that he shall wax in the
waine of the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire is fallen long since, being
divided into ten kingdoms to wit, of the Almanes, England, France, Spain,
Denmark, Scotland, Poland, Navarre, Hungary, Naples, and Sicilie. These
ancients were far from the times of Antichrist, and yet you see how right
they aim at him: Catalog. test. verit.
the lesser marvel that many in succeeding ages, as Echardus, Otho
Frisingensis, Robert Grosthead, Dulcinus Navarenus, Marsilius Patavinus,
Dantes, Michael Cesenus, Johannes de Rupe-scissa, Franciscus Petrarcha,
Henricus de Hassia, Walter Brute, John Huz, Johannes de Vesalia, and diverse
others hit him full, and fastened upon him the name of Antichrist. For they as
being near him, saw in him clearly all those marks, whereby Saint Paul and
Saint John describe that man of sin, and son of perdition. from which we thus
argue: He in whom all or the principal marks of Antichrist are found, he is
the Antichrist. But in the Pope all or the principal marks of Antichrist are
to be found: Ergo the Pope is the Antichrist.


By Pope we understand not this or that Pope in individuo, but rather in
specie, or to speak more properly, the whole succession of Popes, from Boniface
the third, or at least Gregory the seventh, otherwise called Heldebrand. As the
word Devil in the New Testament for the most part signifies not any
particular spirit, but indefinitely an evil spirit, or the kingdom of Satan:
and as the four beasts in Daniel stand not for four Monarchs, but four
Monarchies; so the Beast in the Apocalypse, in whose ougly shape Antichrist
appears, seems not to represent any singular Pope, but the Sea of Rome after
it degenerated into the Papacy. Now in the Bishops of Rome after Boniface and
Heldebrand, we find the name, the seat, the apparel, the pride, the cruelty,
the idolatry, the covetousness, the imposture, the power, and the fortune of
Antichrist.

1. The name of Antichrist contains in it the number 666. which Irenaeus
finds in the word Latinus, (...).

2. The seat of Antichrist is a City built upon seven hills that rules over
the whole world: this City Propertius will tell you to be Rome, Septem urbs
clara jugis, toti quae praesidet orbi.

3. The ornaments of Antichrist are scarlet, and purple, gold, jewels, and
precious stones, which the Pope wears, especially on high days.

4. The time of Antichrist his rising is foretold to be after the division of
the Roman Empire: after which it appears by all stories, that the Pope grew
to his greatness.

5. The vices of Antichrist are these especially: 1. Pride: he shall exalt
himself above all that is called God, that is, Princes; and does not the Pope
so, who admits them to kiss his feet, arrogateth to himself a power over
them to depose them, and dispose of their kingdoms? 2. Idolatry or spiritual
fornication: the great Whore is said to commit fornication with the Princes of
the earth; and does not the Pope entice all Kings and Princes to idolatry,
which is spiritual fornication? 3. Cruelty: the Whore is said to be drunk
with the blood of Saints. I need not apply this note, both their own and our
stories relate of many thousands by the Popes means put to death for the
profession of the Gospel, under the names of Lionists, Waldenses, Albigenses,
Wickliffists, Hussites, Lutherans, Calvinists, and Hugonots. 4. Imposture:
Antichrist shall come after the power of Satan, in all power of signs and
lying wonders; and who pretend miracles, and abuse the world with Legends of
lies, but the Popes adherents? 5. Covetousness: through covetousness he
shall with feigned words make merchandise of you. Now the wares wherewith the
Whore of Babylon deceives the world, what are they but her pardons,
indulgences, hallowed beads, medalls, Agnus Dei's, and the like?


6. The Beast is said to have Apoc. 18.11.
horns like a Lamb, and to speak like a Dragon, and to exercise all the
power of the first beast. This agrees to the Papacy and Pope, who resembles
Christ, whose Vicar he calls himself, and arrogateth to himself Christ's
double power, both Kingly and Priestly. He exercises also the power of the
first beast, to wit, the Roman Empire described by seven heads and ten horns,
because as the first beast, the Roman Empire by power and temporal authority,
so the Pope by policy and spiritual jurisdiction rules over a great part of
the world.

7. It is written of the Whore of Babylon, that the Kings of the earth should
give their power to her for a time, but that in the end they should Apoc.
17.13, 16.
hate her, and make her desolate; which we see daily more and more fulfilled in
the Papacy.

I will be as brief in the application, as I have been long in the explication
of this Scripture. Babylon is figuratively Rome, and Rome is mystically
Babylon. The Edomites the instigators of the Babylonians, and partners with
them in the spoil of the Israelites, may well represent unto us Romish Priests
and Jesuited Papists, rightly to be termed Edomites from Edome, signifying red
or bloody. For a bloody generation they are, as appears by their treasonable
practices against Queen ELIZABETH of happy memory, and our gracious Sovereign
now reigning. These verily seem the natural sons of Esau, who hated Jacob
because God loved him, and sought to destroy him and his posterity because
their father blessed them; even so they hate our Jacob, and seek to root out
his posterity, because God has blessed him with so many crowns, and crowned
him with so many blessings. They had thought in their minds, as we read,
Genes. 27. The days of Genesis 27.41.
mourning will come shortly, and then we will kill Jacob. But blessed be the
God of Jacob, who delivered his anointed from the power of the sword.

The more I look upon the Edomites or Esauites, the more likeness I find
between them and our unnatural countri-men, Jesuited Papists. The Edomites
pretended that they were of the elder house of Isaac, and these pretend that
they are of the elder Church, which is the house of God. The Edomites, though
they were brethren to the Jews, yet they behaved themselves toward them like
mortal enemies; even so our English Papists, though they are our kinsmen and
countri-men, yet since Pope Pius his excommunication of Queen ELIZABETH, they
have proved the most dangerous enemies both of our Church and State: even in
this resembling the Edomites, that as they not only vexed and persecuted the
people of God themselves, but also instigated the Babylonians against them; so
these not content to plot treasons, sow sedition, stir up rebellion in our
kingdom, have dealt with foreign Kings and States to invade our Kingdom, and
root out both Church and Commonwealth. What pity is it that our Rebecca should
have her bowels rent within her by two such children striving in her womb? It
follows, In the day of Jerusalem. Jerusalem had a day, after which she slept
in dust; and the daughter of Babylon appointed a day for England, a fatal and
dismal day, a black and gloomy day, or rather a Gomorrhean night, in which a
hellish design against our Church and Commonwealth was attempted, and if God
himself had not miraculously defeated it, it had been acted: a design to
destroy both at once with fire and brimstone, not falling down from heaven,
but rather rising up from hell; I mean a deep vault dug by the myners of
Antichrist, and fraught with juysses, billets, bars of iron, and 36. barrells
of gunpowder, like so many great pieces of Ordnance full charged, and ready to
be shot off all at once, to blow up the house of Parliament, with the royal
stock, and the three estates of the Kingdom. Remember, O Lord, the children
of Edome in that day, or rather for that day, in which (shall I say) they said,
Raze it, raze it to the very foundation? they more than said it, or cried it,
they would have thundered it out; they assayed it, they did what they could to
raze it. For they planted their murdering artillery at the very foundation of
it. Cursed be their wrath, for it was fierce; and their rage, for it was
furious, nay barbarous, nay prodigious, to cut off root and branch at once, to
beat down City and Temple with one blow, to snatch away on the sudden the King
and Prince, Queen and Nobles, Bishops and Judges, Barons and Burgesses, Papists
and Protestants, Friends and Enemies, and carry them up in a fiery cloud, and
scatter their dismembered members, or rather ashes over the whole City. O
daughter of Babylon, worthy to be destroyed because thou delightest in
destruction; happy shall he be that takes thy young children and monstrous
brats, viz. treasons, plots, conspiracies, and unnatural designs against
Prince and State, and dasheth them against the stones.

To draw toward an end, and to draw you to a real thanksgiving to God for
the deliverance of the three estates of the Kingdom, like the three children
from the fiery furnace heat by the daughter of Babylon. God has done great
things for us this day, whereat we rejoice; let us do something to him and
for him: he has remembered us not in words, but in deeds, let us remember him
as well in deeds as words: let us honor him with our substance, let us bless
him with our hands, let us praise him with our goods.

Peradventure you will say, Our Psalm. 16.2.
goods are nothing to him, our goodness extends not unto him, he is far
above us, and out of the reach of our charity: see how the Prophet himself
removes this rub in the next verse, But to the Saints that are on the earth,
and to them that excel in virtue. And our Savior assures us, that Mat.
25.40. Verily, verily, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
Whatsoever we do unto them, Christ takes it as done unto himself. In
feeding the hungry ye feed Christ, in clothing the naked ye cloth him, in
visiting the imprisoned ye visit him. Though ye cannot now with Mary Magdalen
reach up to his head to break a box of Spicknard, and power it on him, yet ye
can anoint him in his sick and sore, comfort him in his afflicted, provide
for him in his famished, relieve him in his oppressed, yea and redeem him also
in his captive members. This to do is charity and mercy at all times, but now
it is piety and devotion also. It is not sufficient for you to lift up your
hands in prayer and thanksgiving, ye must stretch them out in pious and Heb.
13.16.
charitable contributions: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. And if
ever such sacrifices are due to him, now especially upon the yearly return of
the feast we celebrate for the preservation of our King and Kingdom, Church
and Commonwealth, Nobles and Commons, Goods and Lands, nay Religion and Laws
from the vault of destruction. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edome in that
day what they said, Novelties shall pass with a crack, and Heretics shall
receive a blow: and what they assayed, even to raze Jerusalem and Sion to the
ground: and forget not, O Lord, the Whore of Babylon, which has dyed her
garments scarlet red in the blood of thy Saints and Martyrs: make all her
lovers to forsake her, and abhor her poisoned doctrine, though offered in a
cup of gold. Strip her of her gay attire, pluck down her proud looks, and
humble her before thy Spouse: and if she will not stoop nor repent her of her
spiritual fornication and savage cruelty against the professors of the truth,
reward her as she has served us. But as for those that have forsaken Babel,
and join with us in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel, prosper them
in all the reformed Churches, and grant that as they all agree in the love of
the same truth, so they may seek that truth in love, and that their love may
abound yet more and more in knowledge and all judgment, that they may discern
those things that differ, and approve of those things that are excellent; that
they may be sincere, and without offense till the day of Christ, being filled
with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory
and praise of God. Cui, etc.

SERMONS PREACHED IN LAMBETH PARISH CHURCH.
THE WATCHFUL SENTINEL. A Sermon preached the fifth of November. THE LXI.
SERMON.
PSALM. 121.4. Behold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.


THe more the enemies of the Gospel endeavor to blot out this feast out of our
Calender, and raze it out of the memory of all men, by giving it out where they
see the coast clear, and none to encounter their falsehood, that the ground of
this days devotion was a fiction of ours, not a design of theirs; a stratagem
of state to scandalize them, not a plot of treason to ruin our King and State:
by so much the more all that love the truth in sincerity ought to keep it with
more fervencie of devotion, celebrity of public meeting, and solemnity of all
corresponding rites and ceremonies, that the voice of our thanksgiving, and the
sound of Gods praise for so great a deliverance, may ring to the ends of the
earth, and the children yet unborne may hear it. Other feasts we celebrate by
faith, this by experience and sense: other deliverances we believe, this we
feel: the ground of other festivities are Gods benefits upon his people
indeed, but of other countries and other times, but of this is, the
preservation of our own Country, in our own time. And therefore what S.
Bernard spoke of the feast of Dedication, we may say of this: In fest. dedic.
Tanto nobis debet esse devotior, quanto est familiarior. Nam caeteras quidem
solemnitates cum aliis ecclesiis habemus communes, haec nobis est propria, ut
necesse sit a nobis vel a nemine celebrari.
We ought the more religiously to keep this feast, by how much the more near
it concerns us; for other solemnities we have common with other Churches,
this is so proper to us, that if we celebrate it not, none will. This we
ought in special to own, because it presents to all thankful hearts, a
special act of Gods watchful care over our Church, our Nation, yea and this
place. For this monster of all treasons, which no age can parallel, was
conceived within our precincts, and so it should have brought forth ruin and
destruction in our eyes, if God had not crushed it in the shell: we should have
seen on the sudden the city over against us all in a light fire, all the sky
in a cloud of brimstone, and the river died with blood: we should have heard
nothing after the crack of thunder, but outcries and voices in Ramah, weeping
and mourning, and exceeding great lamentation, our Rachel mourning for her
children, and she would not have been comforted, because they should not have
been. The louder the cry of our sorrow would then have been, the louder ought
now to be the shouts of our joy. To which purpose I have made choice of this
verse for my text, taken out of a Psalm of degrees, that I might thereby raise
my meditations and your affections to the height of this feast. The words may
serve as a motto, and the work of this day for an image to make a perfect
emblem of Gods watchful care over his people, and the peoples safety under
the wings of his providence.

But before I enter upon the parts of this Psalm, it will be requisite that I
clear the title, a Song of degrees. If the meaning be as some translate the
words, Shur hamagnaloth, Canticum excellentissimum, an excellent song, (...)
as we read, Adam hamagnaloth, a man of eminent degree; are not all the other
Psalms likewise excellent songs? Why then has this only, with some few that
follow it, the garland set upon it? Some will have these fifteen Psalms
beginning from the 120. to have the name of songs of degrees, (...), or (...),
from the history, others from the ceremony, a third sort from the music, and
the fourth from the matter and special contents of them.

1. They who fetch it from the history, affirm that these Psalms were penned,
or at least repeated, and sung by the Ezra 7.4.
Jews Hamagnaloth, in their ascending or coming up from Babylon into their
own Country: and this conceit is the more probable, because some of the
Psalms speak expressly of their return from captivity, and most of them of
Gods deliverance of his people from great dangers and troubles.

2. They who deduce it from the sacred rite or ceremony used in the singing of
them, relate that the Priest sang these Psalms Hamagnaloth, or (...), upon the
stairs or steps, as they marched up into the house of the Lord.

3. They who derive the name from the music, report that these Psalms were
sung hamagnaloth, that is, with ascensions, or raising up the voice by degrees,
as it is said that the Levites praised God with a great voice, or a voice on
high.

4. They who take it from the special contents of these Chrysostom. in Psalm. 20.
Psalms, contend that the verses of this Psalm are like the (...), rounds of
Jacobs ladder, on which we may ascend up to heaven, as the Angels did upon that.

These reasons are in a kind of sequence like notes in music: for because
they are Psalms full of special matter for instruction and comfort, it is
likely that the chief Musician set them to an higher cliffe; and because both
tune as well as ditty were excellent, it is probable that these were selected,
both to be sung by the Jews in their ascending from Babylon, as also by the
Priests in their going up usually into the Temple.

Thus the title is cleared on all hands: now the song it self admits a like
partition to that of the Musicians in their pricked lessons; which consist of,
1. A ground. 2. Running in division upon it.


Here the ground contains but three notes: 1. The person, he. 2. The
attribute, watchful providence or protection. 3. The object, his people Israel.


The division upon the first note is Jehovah, verse. 1. which was, and which is,
and which is to come; maker of heaven and earth, verse. 2.

Upon the second, thy keeper, verse. 3. thy preserver, verse. 7, 8. thy
protector in danger, verse. 5. from danger, verse. 7. for the time present and
future, verse the last.

Upon the third, Israel in general, verse. 4. every one of Israel in
particular, verse. 5. in body and soul, verse. 7. at home and abroad, verse. 8.

Behold, let your eye be upon him, whose eye never sleeps nor slumbreth,
observe your observer and preserver. Behold in he, sovereigne majesty and
omnipotent power: in keeps, his gracious protection: in Israel, his peculiar
affection: in neither slumbreth nor sleeps, his continual watchfulness.

Behold, we have rung this larum bell heretofore, to awake your attention and
affection, and now it gives no uncertain sound: but what or whom are we to
behold?

He. In the next verse the Prophet names him; Jehovah is thy keeper. Of all
names of God this may seem to challenge a kind of precedencie: for it is
taken from the essence of God, and never in Scripture is attributed to any
creature; this is (...), the Greeks Tetragrammaton, the Latins Jove, the
Jews Dread and Fear; who when they meet with it in the old Testament, adore
it with silence, or fill up the sentence with Adonai, Lord: only as we read
in the Talmud, the high Priest in his holy vestments, when he entered into the
Sanctum Sanctorum, in the sacred action of blessing the people, might pronounce
it. Every syllable in it is a mystery; Je has relation to the time future, ho
to the present, vah to that which is past, as some of the Rabbis observe. And
some Christian Interpreters conceive, that S. John alludes thereunto in the
description of God, (...), Apoc. 1.8.
He which was, and is, and is to come. The verb from whence the name is
derived signifies to be, either to teach us that all being is from him, or
that he alone may simply and absolutely be said to be, who was from all
eternity what he is, and shall be to all eternity what he was and is; or to
give us Exodus 6.3.
assurance of the performance of all his promises. How shall we doubt of any
word that proceeds from his mouth, whose name carries in it existence or
performance of all his words? or to insinuate in this name the best definition
of his nature, which is this; an infinite spirit, who is his own being; or,
who has being from himself, in himself, and for himself. All creatures were
of him, are in him, and must be for him: God alone is of himself, in
himself, and for himself. Some wierdraw farther, and make so small a line,
that it will scarce hold, viz. that all the letters in this name are quiescent,
to intimate quietem in solo deo esse, that the rest of the soul is only in
God; according to that divine speech of S. Austine, Domine, fecisti nos ad te,
and inquietum est cor nostrum donec perveniat ad te: O Lord, thou have made us
to or for thee, and our heart will never be at rest till we come to thee.

That keeps. God keeps us both immediately by himself, and mediately by
Angels and men. His Angels are our guardians in all our ways: Magistrates both
ecclesiastical and civil, Parents, Tutors, and Masters, keepers in time of
peace; and Generals, Captains and Soldiers in time of war. And if you
demand with the Poet, Quis custodes custodiet ipsos? Who shall look to the
overseers of others? who shall watch our watchmen, and guard our guardians? I
answer, this Custos Israelis in my text. There are two sorts of keepers, 1.
Some keep from suffering evil, as a Guardian does his Ward. 2. Others keep
from doing evil, as the Lieutenant of the Tower, or a Messenger to whose
custody a prisoner is committed.


God is our keeper in both senses; for he is both Custos protectionis, and
Custos conversationis: he keeps us from suffering evil, by his protecting
power; and from doing evil, by his restraining grace: he keeps us in
prosperity, that it corrupt us not; in adversity, that it conquer us not: he
keeps us in our conception from abortion, in our birth from hurt, in our life
from manifold dangers, in our death from eternal terrors.

Israel. Israel, as the learned distinguish, is sometimes taken for Israel, 1.
According to the flesh only, as unbeleeving Jews. 2. According to the spirit
only, as believing Gentiles. 3. According to the flesh and spirit, as the
believing posterity of Jacob.


For as Tertullian spoke of Christian Soldiers and Panims, De coron. mil. Ap d
Deum tam miles est Paganus fidelis, quam Paganus est miles infidelis.
a faithful Pagan is as well a Soldier in Gods account, as an unfaithful
Soldier is a Pagan: so we may truly say, that an unbeleeving Israelite is a
Gentile, and a believing Gentile is a true Israelite. Howbeit the former
division is not adequate: a more complete may be this; Israel is taken in holy
Scripture, 1. For the root, to wit, Jacob himself, to whom first the name of
Israel was given upon a special occasion. 2. For the stock or trunk, the
whole posterity of Jacob. 3. For the branch, to wit, the ten Tribes divided
from the other two in Rehoboams time. 4. For the whole tree as it were, that
is, the whole number of the elect, who because they prevail with God, are
termed Israelites, and of Israel: in this last and largest sense the words of
S. Paul are to be understood, Romans 11.26.
All Israel shall be saved.


Here Israel is taken primarily for the Church and Commonwealth of the Jews:
but secondarily and consequently, for all Kingdoms and States professing the
true worship of God, and commending themselves to his protection. As God is the
Savior of all, but especially the elect: so he is the keeper of all his
creatures, but of man above all, and of Israel above all men.

He keeps all, 1. Creatures in their state. 2. Men in their ways and
callings. 3. Israel in his favor.
1. All creatures by his power. 2. All men by his providence. 3. Israel by his
grace.
1. All creatures from disorder and utter confusion. 2. All men from manifold
calamities and miseries. 3. Israel from the power of sin and death.


He keeps Israel, 1. As his chief treasure, most watchfully. 2. As his
dearest spouse, most tenderly. 3. As the apple of his eye, most charily and
warily.


He keeps every faithful soul, 1. As his chief treasure, that the Devil
steal it not. 2. As his chaste spouse, that the flesh abuse it not. 3. As the
apple of his eye, that the world hurt it not.


In this respect, as Israel is elsewhere called his Exodus 19.5. Deuteronomy. 14.2.
peculiar people; so here his peculiar charge: he makes more account of Israel
than all the world besides, he keeps Israel above all, nay he keeps all for
his Isreal's sake, that is, the elect. As he preserved the Arc for Noah's sake,
and Goshen for the ancient Israelites sake, and all that were in the ship for
S. Paul's sake, and all that were in the bath for S. John's sake, and all that
fled to the tombs of the Martyrs in Rome, when the Goths sacked the city, for
the Christians sake: so at this day he supporteth all Kingdoms and States,
for the Churches sake. The world is as an hop-yard, the Church as the hops,
Kingdoms, States, and Commonwealths as the poles: and as the owner of the
hop-yard preserves the poles and stakes carefully, not for themselves, but
that the hops may grow upon them: so God preserves all states and societies of
men, that they may be a support to his Church. We may take this note higher,
and truly affirm that he keeps heaven and earth for her sake; the earth to
be as a nursery for her children, to grow a while; and the Heaven for his
garden and celestial Paradise, whither he will transplant them all in the
end. Wherefore although the world never so much scorn, and contemn, and
malign, and persecute Gods chosen; yet it is indebted to them for its being
and continuance: for God keeps the heavens for the earth, the earth for
living creatures, other living creatures for men, men for Israel, and Israel
for the elect sake. For their sake it is, that the heavens move, the sun,
moon, and stars shine, the winds blow, the springs flow, the rivers run, the
plants grow, the earth fructifieth, the beasts, fowls, and fishes multiply:
for as soon as grace has finished her work, and the whole number of the
elect is accomplished, nature shall utterly cease, and this world shall give
place to a better, in which righteousness shall 2 Pet. 3.13.
dwell. Yet when heaven and earth shall pass, this word of God shall not
pass: for he that now keeps militant Israel in the bosom of the earth,
shall then keep triumphant Israel in Abraham's bosom.

Shall neither slumber nor sleep. What the Roman Orator spoke pleasantly of
Caninius his Consulship, that set with the sun, and lasted but for one day,
Erasm. in Apoph. Cic.
Vigilantissimum habuimus Consulem, qui toto Consulatu suo somnum non cepit;
there was never so vigilant a Consul as Caninius, who during all the time of
his Consulship never took a nap; may truly be said of the keeper of Israel,
that he never suffers his eyes to sleep, nor his eyelids to slumber.

Rejoice, O daughter of Sion, for the keeper of Israel continually watches
over thee for good: but tremble, O thou whore of Babylon, for he continually
watches over thee for evil. Ne time a malo externo, fidelis anima, quia non
dormit custos qui te conservat; time tibi a peccato and malo interno, quia non
dormit custos qui te observat: O faithful soul, fear not outward evils,
because he sleeps not who conserveth thee; but be afraid of sin and inward
evil, because he sleeps not who observes thee. God receives Israel into
his special protection, and there is no safety out of it: Israel is now
confined within the bounds of the Church, and questionless out of it there is
no safety. While the Soldiers are within the leaguer, they may sleep all
night securely, because they know the Sentinels keep their watches: but if
they wander abroad, and sleep overtake them, they are every hour in danger to
have their throats cut.

Behold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. What the
Apostle S. Paul professes of himself ( Aug. ep. ad Hieron.
non mentientis astu, sed compatientis affectu) 1 Cor. 9.22.
I am made all things to all men, that I may by all means win some; may in a
true and pious sense be applied to God himself, who to turn us, and gain us
to himself, turns himself (after a sort) into all forms and natures. To
allure the hungry, he becomes bread; to excite the thirsty, a fountain of
living water; to draw to him the naked, a wedding garment; to bring in them
that are astray, the way; to revive the dead, the resurrection and the life.
This accords with Hom. 1. in. Cant. Singulis quibusque sensibus animae
singula quaeque Christus efficitur: idcirco verum lumen, ut habeant animae quo
illuminentur: idcirco verbu^, ut habeant aures quod audiant: idcirco panis
vitae, ut habeat gustus quod degustet: idcirco unguentum and nardus, ut habeat
odoratus animae fragrantiam verbi: idcirco and palpabilis and verbum caro
dicitur, ut possit interioris animae manus contingere de verbo vitae.
Origin his note on the Canticles: Christ becomes to every sense a most
delectable object; light, that the eyes of the soul may have wherewith to be
enlightened; the word, that the ears may have wherewith to be filled or
rounded; the bread of life, that the taste may have to please it, and stomach
to satisfy it; spicknard, to delight the smell of the soul; lastly, flesh,
that the hands of the soul may handle the word of life. (1 John 1.1.) O how
should this inflame our love to God, that he should become to our soul
whatsoever she can desire! And not this only, but that he should condescend
in love to take upon him all callings and offices, for the safety, welfare,
and comfort of his Church. To give her contentment in himself, he weddeth her,
and becomes her husband: to dress her vines, and ripen her fruits, her
husbandman: to instruct her in the doctrine of salvation, her Schoolmasters:
to cure her diseases, her Physician: to plead her title to the kingdom of
heaven, her Advocate: and lastly, to keep her from all ghostly and bodily
enemies, her Guardian and Watchman. That which Cain refused to be to his own
brother, God is to his Church, that is, her keeper; and so watchful and
careful a keeper is he, that his eye is never off her day nor night. The
point of special observation in the whole text is, the watchful eye of Gods
providence over his Church, which never closes, nor so much as winketh. The
parts are, 1. The person, who tends and tendreth Israel, he. 2. The office
he undertaketh and performs, keeps. 3. His charge, that is, the object of
his care, Israel. 4. His vigilancie over his charge, neither slumbreth nor
sleeps.


The enemies of the Church are either bodily or ghostly: against the former he
fenceth her with his power, against the latter with his grace.

To keep, is to look to, preserve and protect, save and defend from all
violence or injury, waste or spoil, hurt or destruction: as an husband does
his wife, a guardian his ward, a tutour his pupil, a Centurion his band, a
watchman his quarter, a shepherd his flock, a keeper his park. And all these
relations the Church has to Christ, in regard of the kind offices which he
continually performs to her in greatest love. For she is his spouse, and he
her husband: she his ward, and he her guardian: she his pupil, and he her
tutour: she his band, and he her Sentinel: she his city, and he her
watchman: she his flock, and he her shepherd: she his park, or rather dear,
and he her keeper.

In the verse immediately going before, the Prophet spoke in the singular
number, he shall keep thee: but here in the plural, extending the care of God
to the Church in general, to teach us that our heavenly father holds such a
watchful August. confess. Sic curas unumquemque tanquam solu cures, and sic
omnes tanquam singulos.
eye of providence over every one of his faithful children, as if he tended
him only, and yet takes such a care of all in general, as of every one in
particular.

Shall neither slumber nor sleep. Aristot. de some. and vigil.
Somnus est ligatio sensuum: Sleep is the tying of the senses: which if they
be heart-bound, we are said to sleep; if slack, or loose, to slumber. The
senses of our body are the windows of the soul, which in a slumber are as it
were shut to, but barred and bolted when we are fast asleep. Like as we see
sometimes there arises out of the earth a thin mist, which the sun easily
pierces with his beams, and disperseth it with his heat; sometimes a thick
vapor mounteth up to the middle region of the air, where by the temper of the
place it is turned into a dark cloud that obscureth the sky for many hours:
in like manner, when a thin fume ascends from the stomach into the brain,
it causes but a slumber, out of which we easily rouse up our selves; but when
a gross vapor climbeth up thither, it overcasteth the clear sky of our
fancy, and in the fall stops all the passages of our senses, and then we
sleep soundly. But I need not discourse of the nature of sleep and slumber,
there be few here but too accurately distinguish them: for though they count it
a foul shame to sleep out a Sermon, yet they make no scruple of conscience to
slumber, and sometimes nod; who shall not need with Aristot. vit. praefix. op.
Aristotle to hold a brazen ball in their hand over a basin, to awake them if
sleep chance to surprise them: if the words of our Savior continually ring in
their ears, Mark. 14.37.
Can ye not watch with me one hour? Out of this brief representation of the
nature of sleep, it appears that it is a matter of much more difficulty to
abstain from slumbring, than from sleeping: therefore the members of this
sentence may seem to be displaced; and therefore Calvin in Psalm. 121.
Calvin and Bucer in Psalm. 121.
Bucer thus translate the words, Non dormitat, nedum dormit; he that keeps
Israel never slumbreth, much less sleeps: or we may paraphrase the words
thus, He that keeps Israel, neither suffers his eyelids to slumber by
day, nor his eyes to sleep by night; but keeps a continual watch over his
people. The words thus illustrated, present to our serious thoughts these most
important considerations: 1. That God himself is the Churches keeper. 2. That
how many, or how great enemies soever lie in wait for her, ye she is kept.


Israel is an impregnable castle, not by reason of the nature of the place or
situation, nor in regard of the great store of men and munition in it: but
because he that keeps it does neither slumber nor sleep. Ecclesia oppugnatur
saepe, expugnatur nunquam. Many times have they Psalm. 129.1, 2.
fought against me from my youth up, may Israel now say: Many a time have they
afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me. There
can be no State, Society, Kingdom, or Commonwealth, so strongly built and
fenced, but if the floods of sedition arise, and the raging tempest of foreign
forces beat upon it, it may be ruinated, because it is founded upon sand, that
is, men who are but sand and dust: but let the floods of persecution arise, and
the wind of heresy blow never so furiously upon the Church, yet it will stand,
because it is built upon the rock Christ Jesus. What speak we of clouds,
which are the windows of heaven? the gates of Matt. 16.18.
hell shall never be able to prevail against it. By the gates of hell, many
learned Interpreters understand the counsels, projects, plots, and designs of
wicked men; because, for the most part, the counsel among the Jews, for their
better security, sat in their gate-houses, which in all strong cities are best
fenced by nature or art. For which cause the spirit of God describes the
strength of any city or country by the gates thereof. He shall Psalm. 147.13.
make fast the bars of thy gates: and, Thy Genesis 22.17.
seed shall possess the gate of the enemy, that is, thy seed shall take their
garrisons, and occupy their strongest holds. If we like of the former
interpretation, Now Israel, now England may say, the gates of hell, that is,
the deep projects and counsels, plots and machinations of the Miners of
Antichrist, as deep as hell, have not prevailed against me: Or if ye please,
ye may take the barrels of gunpowder laid in the vault of destruction, and
chambers of death, for the gates of hell; and the massy pieces of iron and
wood, for the bars of these gates, which if the Devil or his instruments
could have then broken open in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, our King
and Parliament, Nobles and Commons, Clergy and Gentry, with the chief
records and monuments of this Kingdom, had been blown up with the breath of
Satan, in a cloud of fire and brimstone into the air. That blast, in all
likelihood, would have proved the last gasp of our Church and Commonwealth. If
he that keeps Israel, first God, next the King, had slept or slumbred that
night: it is to be feared, we all here present had long ere this slept our
last sleep in the dust of the earth. But blessed be the God of Israel, who
has saved and redeemed his people from the paw of the Devil and jaws of
death, and has raised up a mighty salvation for us in the hand of his servant
James. The Devil and his instruments do not watch so narrowly to destroy us,
as God and his Angels to save and protect us. He that saves our life, in
effect gives it; and therefore Aristotle moves a question, whom we are more
bound to rescue, though it be with the peril of our lives, our father, or
such a friend who has ventured his life for us, and saved us from certain
death. The decision whereof may be this, That we owe our life to both; but it
being impossible that we should pay it to both, in all reason we are to lay it
down for him first, to whom it was first due, and that is our father:
Whereupon it ensues, that we owe God many lives if we had them, because he not
only gave us our life, but also saves us from manifold deaths, both by
ordinary and extradinary means, both by general and special providence. His
providence in general looks to all men good and bad, yea to all creatures
whatsoever; which could not subsist for a moment, if he kept them not in the
course of their nature. But above all creatures in special he is the Job 7.20.
preserver of men; among men, the children of Deuteronomy. 32.11.
Israel were his portion, the lot of his inheritance, whom he kept as the apple
of his eye. As an Eagle stirs up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings; so the Lord
led Israel. We must go yet farther; there is an Israel of Israel, to wit, the
Elect in Israel, which are as a Diamond in the ring on his finger, and as the
Zach. 2.8.
apple of his eye: He that touches you (says he) touches the apple of mine
eye. To them he vouchsafes more special favors; for them he blesses the

feathers, and under his wings shall thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield
and buckler. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
nigh thy dwelling. He shall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in
all thy ways. They shall keep thee up in their hands, that thou dash not thy
foot against a stone. Thou shall tread upon the Lion and the Adder: the young
Lion and the Dragon shall thou trample under feet. And it is the keeper of this
Israel which neither slumbereth nor sleeps.

Ye may here object, If he that keeps Israel never slumbereth nor sleeps,
what mean those expostulations and calling up (if I may so speak) of Almighty
God? Up, Psalm. 44.23, 26.
Lord, why sleep thou? arise, cast us not off for ever: arise for our help,
and redeem us for thy mercies sake. If God has need to be awaked, he must
needs be at least in a slumber: If the loud cries of his afflicted children
awake him, and he stands up like a Giant refreshed with wine to fight for
them, it should seem before he was asleep. It may seem so indeed, because
(according to outward appearance and semblance) he was so. When a man is
asleep, though any miscall him, or make mouths at him, or put any indignity
upon him, he stirs not, nor has any sense of any thing that is done to him.

slumber of Almighty God is nothing else but the connivency of his justice for a
time, and it is mercy which casts him into this sweet sleep, which yet does
not so surprise his powers, or any way bind his senses, but that he sees the
deepest plots of his enemies, he hears their secretest consultations, and is
sensible of the least wrong offered to his chosen. Oculi ejus vident, palpebrae

enough, though he seem to neglect it. As a fisher sees a fish come to his
hook, nibble at the bait, bite it, and swallow it down, and then he gives a
jerke with his angle-rod; so Almighty God permits wicked purposes and
enterprises to hold on in a straight course, till they are even at the goal,
and then he turns and overturneth them: In foribus Hydriam; he breaks the
pitcher at the door, cutteth down the ear when it is full, launceth the sore

be built and furnished for the invasion and utter subversion of our Israel, and
so great a design to be carried so close, that the Fleet was in sight of the
haven before it was discovered? but then in the height of their swelling pride,
when in hope and almost in sight they had devoured the whole kingdom: Claud.

But this day presents afresh to our memory a stranger example of divine
providence, and a prodigious design of Satan's malice, who put into the heart
of that caitiffe Catesby, the most hellish project and plot of treason that
ever entered into the heart of man or Devil, to offer up our King, Queen,
Prince, Nobles, Prelates, Judges, and all States assembled in Parliament for a
holocaust, or whole burnt offering to the Moloch of Rome. The keeper of Israel
seemed for a long time to slumber, nay rather to be fast asleep. The plot is
contrived, the actors designed, the enginers provided, the mine dug, the
wall pierced, the seller hired, the powder bought, the murdering artillery
amassed, the train laid, and the incendiary ready with match and touch-wood. O

Israel, O sentinel of Jacob sleep thou now when our destruction sleeps
not?

But, Ecce non dormitat, neque dormit custos Israelis; be of good cheer, the
keeper of Israel does neither slumber nor sleep. By this keeper the Prophet
means Almighty God, whom he names in the verses following, The Lord

shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in from this time forth for

ABRAHAM HIS PURCHASE. A Sermon preached at the Consecration of the Churchyard
enclosed within the new wall at Lambeth. THE LXII. SERMON.
ACTS 7.16. And were carried over into Sechem, and laid in the sepulcher that
Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emor, of Sechem.


UPon the hearing of my Text read, I suppose many look for a Funeral Sermon,
and have already so christened my future discourse in their preconceits. For
here is the carrying of the dead, and the interring, together with a place for
burial, Genesis 22.7.
purchased by Abraham for him and his heirs for ever. But as Isaac said to his
father Abraham, Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the Lamb for a
burnt offering? so they may reason with themselves, Behold the bearers, and a
sepulcher, and the ground, but where is the corpse to be laid in it? My answer
hereunto must be a thanksgiving to God, whose mercy has altered the case with
us, because his compassions fail not. It stood lately thus with us, when the
ways of Sion mourned, because none walked in them; and the gates of the
Sanctuary lamented, because almost none, specially of the better rank, who
left us desolate, entered at them. We saw with weeping eyes and bleeding hearts
a press as it were of dead corpses, and many suing for a reversion of a void
room in our dormitory; but now (God be blessed) we have a place given for
burial, and no corpses at this present to take real and corporal possession
thereof. Howbeit, because what has be fallen us heretofore, may also
hereafter, and if death should strike any at this present without a writ of
removal, which cannot be sued out of any court for ought I know against the
dead, we know not where to bestow them: we could do no less in Christian
charity and providence, than procure the bounds of our Golgotha to be enlarged.
For though other houses and tenements stand void with us, the grave shall never
want guests, nor the Churchyard and vaults under ground tenants against their
will. All men and women are flowers, and all flowers will fall, and when they
are ready to fall, we shall have slips (I fear) but too many to plant this
parcel of ground which we have gained in by the gift of the father of this
Sichem.

But hereof hereafter, when I shall have opened my Text, and the sepulcher in
it, and who were interred there, and how they came thither. If in any Text
almost of the whole Scripture, surely in this the coherence needs to be
handled. For at the first sight this relation of the burial of the Patriarchs
seems to have no affinity at all with Saint Stephens apology for himself
against the Jews, who charged him with blasphemy against Moses, and against
the Law. Now as in a shooting match a stander by can hardly discern the flight
of an arrow, unless he mark the Archers aim, and observe the flight-shaft as
soon as it is delivered out of the bow; so unless ye mark Saint Stephens
aim, and observe how he enters into this story of the Old Testament, ye can
hardly discern how direct it is to his maine scope and purpose. But so it is,
that as he that shoots far draws his arrow backward up to the head; and
as he that leapeth forward fetches his feeze a great way back: so does Saint
Stephen here seem to give ground, and recoile a great way backward; but it is
to come on with more force, and powerfully to confound the Jews, who began not
now to persecute the Saints of God, and Witnesses of Jesus Christ, but in all
ages had done the like. Fabius Maximus (as Live. dec. 3. l. 2.
Livie writes) kept aloof off from the Carthaginian army upon a high hill,
till he saw that Hannibal had foiled Minutius in the plain; but then he
falls upon him, and routs all his troops: whereupon Hannibal uttered that
memorable speech, I ever feared that the cloud which hovered so long upon the
hills would in the end power down, and give us a sad shower. Saint Stephen
like Fabius for a great while keeps aloof off from the Jews, and his
discourse resembles a dark cloud hovering on the top of a hill, which on the
sudden in the end rained down upon them, and caused a bitter storm, for
killing first all the servants sent to them by the Master of the Vineyard, and
last of all his Son. The Jews bragged much of their fathers; Saint Stephen
by epitomizing the story of the Old Testament, shows unto them that they
ought rather to be ashamed of them, in whose wicked steps notwithstanding they
trod, and were now (as their fathers ever had bin) a stiff-necked people, of
uncircumcised ears and hearts, resisting the spirit of God, and cruelly
persecuting those to death, who showed before of the coming of the just One,
of whom (says he) ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: who have
received the Law by the disposition of Angels, and have not kept it.

The accusers of Saint Stephen articled against him, that he had uttered
blasphemy against the Law of Moses, and against the Temple, because he taught
that the ceremonies of the Law were fulfilled in Christ, and that the shadow
ought to vanish, the body being come in place. Saint Stephen answers for
himself, that the doctrine of the Gospel was ancienter than the Law or the
Temple, and that all the furniture of the Temple and Arc were made according
to the pattern in the Mount, and had a reference to heavenly and spiritual
things revealed in the Gospel: that God was now to be worshipped in spirit and
truth, by faith in Christ now come, as he had been by the fathers before the
Law in Christ to come, who by faith gave charge that their bones should be
carried out of Egypt, and buried in the land of Canaan, believing that God
would certainly perform his promise made unto their posterity, first of the
real possession of the earthly, and after that of the heavenly inheritance by
the seed of Abraham, in whom all Nations are blessed, Christ Jesus, that should
be born in that land. What they gave in charge was accordingly performed, as ye
hear in the words of my Text, So Jacob went into Egypt and dyed, he and our
fathers, and were carried over into Sichem, and laid in the sepulcher that
Abraham bought, etc.

Ye see the coherence, but ye cannot yet discern the truth of the relation,
because there is a mist on the words, which has caused many to miss their
way; and it cannot be otherwise dispelled, than by clearing this whole
relation of Saint Stephen, and comparing it with the narration of Moses.

1. It is evident out of Genes. 23.16, 20. that Abraham for four hundreds
shekels of silver bought the field of Ephron the Hittite, which was in
Machpelah, and therein a cave to bury the dead.

2. It is evident out of Genes. 33.19. that Jacob bought a parcel of a field
where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor Sechems
father, for a hundred pieces of money.

3. It is evident likewise out of Genes. 50.13. that Jacobs sons carried him
into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field in Machpelah,
which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of
Ephron the Hittite before Mamre.

4. It is evident out of Jos. 24.32. that the children of Israel brought the
bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried them in Sechem in a parcel of ground
which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Sechem for a hundred
pieces of silver, and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

Now the points of difficulty are three:

1. Whether all the Patriarchs were buried in Sechem, or only Joseph. For in
the book of Josuah there is mention made of none buried there but Joseph; yet
Saint Stephen here speaks in the plural number, Our fathers dyed, and were
carried over into Sechem. And Saint Jerome, who lived in those parts writes,
that in his time the sepulcher of the twelve Patriarchs was to be seen in
Sechem.

2. Whether Abraham or Jacob bought this field wherein they were buried. For
both bought ground for burial, but not at the same rate, nor in the same
place, nor from the same Landlords. For Abraham paid for his purchase four
hundred pieces of silver, Jacob an hundred: Abraham's lay in the country of
Heth, Jacobs of Sechem: Abraham bought it of Ephron the Hittite, Jacob of Hamor
the Sechemite. If the Patriarchs were laid in a sepulcher at Sechem, it could
not be that which Abraham bought: for that was not in the tenure and occupation
of the Sechemites, but of the Hittites.

3. Whether Hamor were the father or son of Sechem. For in Genesis we read,
that he was the father of Sechem: but in the Acts many translate (...), the son
of Sechem.

1. The first doubt may be thus cleared. Joseph alone was buried in Sechem, and
rested there: but the other Patriarchs were at the first buried at Sechem, but
afterward removed from thence to Ephron, and were buried all in Abraham's vault
or cave: thus Josephus and S. Jerome are easily reconciled. For though the
bones of them all lay in Ephron, yet at Sechem there might be some monument of
them remaining, as empty tombs with some inscription.

2. The second difficulty is much more intricate, and those who have stroven to
get out of it have more entangled themselves and others in it. Calvin's answer
is somewhat too peremptory, that there is an error in all our copies of the
New Testament, and ought to be corrected: and though Beza go about to excuse
the matter by a semblance of some like misnomer in the Gospel, yet this his
observation, unless he could produce some ancient copies, wherein such
mistakes were not to be found, opens a dangerous gap to Infidels and
Heretics, who hereby will be apt to take occasion to question the infallible
truth of the holy Writ. Canus in going about to take out the blot, makes it
bigger, saying, that Saint Luke erred not in relating Saint Stephens speech,
but that Saint Stephens memory failed him, and that through error or
inadvertency he confounded Jacobs purchase with Abraham's. This answer comes
near to blasphemy: for no man doubts but that Saint Stephen in his speech
spoke as he was inspired by the holy Ghost. Therefore Lyranus, Lorinus, and
many others, think to salve all by putting two names upon the same man, whom
they will have sometimes to be called Ephron, sometimes Hamor: but they bring
no good proof out of Scripture for it; and though they could make Ephron and
Hamor the same man, yet they can never make the cave in the land of the
Hittites, and that in the land of the Sechemites to be one and the same parcel
of ground.

With submission to more learned judgments (quia hic Delio opus est natatore)
I take it that either (...) should be rendered by, and joined to the word (...),
and a comma at (...), and so the sense is, That the Patriarchs were translated
into Sechem by the Sechemites, and laid in Abraham's sepulcher which he bought
for money: or (...) to be understood, and then the meaning will be this, That
some of the Patriarchs were laid in Abraham's sepulcher, some in the field that
Jacob bought. Thus then (according to the original) we may render this verse,
And they were carried over into Sechem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham
bought, besides that which Jacob bought of Hamor, that is: Jacob dyed, and our
fathers, and some of them were bestowed in Sechem in the cave which Jacob
bought, and some of them in that which Abraham bought.

3. The third doubt is easily resolved. For Hamor was the father of Sechem, as
we read Genes. 33.19. neither does S. Stephen gainsay it: for his words are
(...), of Sechem, which should have been translated the father of Sechem, as
Herodotus in Clio says, (...), and in Thalia, (...), Mar. 15.40.
and Saint Mark, (...). Adrastus of Mydas, to wit, the father of Mydas; Cyrus
of Cambyses, that is, the father of Cambyses; Mary of James, that is, Mary the
mother of James.

The mist being thus dispelled, we may clearly see our way, and readily follow
the Patriarchs in the funeral procession from Egypt, first to Sechem, and
afterward to Ephron.

And they were carried over, etc. This transportation offers to our religious
thoughts two acts: 1. Of Piety, 2. Of Charity.
both significative and mystical. For the carrying the Patriarchs bones from
Egypt to Canaan, shadoweth our removal after death from Egyptian darkness to
the inheritance of Saints in light; and the laying them by the bones of Abraham
may represent unto us how the souls of all the faithful immediately after
they were severed from their bodies, are carried by Angels into the bosom of
Abraham. The first I call an act of piety or religion, because the Patriarchs
before their death by faith gave charge of their bones; and their posterity
executed their last Will in this point, to profess their faith in Gods
promise, which was to give the land of Canaan to their seed for an inheritance,
and accordingly by their dead bodies they took a kind of real possession
thereof.

And they. As by a Synecdoche the soul is put for the man, Anima cujusque is
est quisque; so by the same figure the corpses of the Patriarchs are called the
Patriarchs. Poole elegantly called his dead body his depositum: Scaliger his
relic: Saint Paul the tent-maker agreeable to his profession, called it an
earthly tabernacle. And although indeed it be but the casket which contains
in it the precious ring, our immortal spirit, yet in regard of the union of it
to the soul, and because it concurreth with the soul to the physical
constitution of a man, it may by a figure be called a man.

Yea, but had the Patriarchs no privilege, but must they go the way of all
flesh? They must: for earth is in their composition, and into the earth must be
their resolution. As the world is a circle, so all things in the world in this
are like a circle, that they end where, or as they began. The vapors that are
drawn up from the earth, fall down again upon the earth in rain. The fire
that descended at the first from the region of fire in the Pickolom. Phys.
hollow of the Moon, ascends up thither again. The waters that flow from the
sea return back to the sea: in like manner the soul of man, which was
infused by God, returns to God that gave it; but the body, which was made of
red earth, returns to dust as it was. We need not inquire of Scripture where
reason speaks so plain, nor interrogate reason where sense gives daily
testimony to the truth. Every passing bell rings this lesson in our ears:
Omnis loculus locus est; every coffin is a topicke to prove it: every grave
lays it open to us: every speechless man on his deathbed cries out to us,
Memento mori, quod tueris eris.

Were carried over into Sechem. The life of man is a double pilgrimage: 1. Of
the outward man. 2. Of the inward man.


The outward travelleth from the cradle to the coffin, the inward from earth to
heaven. Of all creatures man only is properly a pilgrim on earth; because he
alone is borne, and lives all his time here out of his own country: of all men
the Patriarchs were the greatest pilgrims, both in life and death; for they
spent all their life in wearisome and dangerous peregrinations, and after their
death their bodies went as it were in pilgrimage, and there visited first
Sechem, and then Machpelah, where they took up their rest. It is the usual
wish and proverbiall speech of men, Though I toil and moile here, yet I hope
one day I shall rest in my grave. No man can promise himself so much: for not
only the bodies of men accursed of God have been dug out of their graves, to
teach us, that there is no sanctuary for a wicked person living or dying; but
even Gods servants have been oftentimes removed out of their earthly beds, some
in honor to them, and others out of malice again^ ^^em, to dishonor and
disgrace them. The bodies of Gervasius and Protasius, Martyrs, were translated
from a blind and obscure place in Millaine where they lay, to a more celebrious
and illustrous Church, to do them the greater honor: on the contrary,
Eusebius writes, that diverse Martyrs in France were by the Gentiles plucked
out of their graves, and burnt to ashes, and their ashes cast into the river
Roan: and the Papists, as if they would make it known to the world that no
Painims or Gentiles should outdo them, in wreaking their malice against the
professors of the truth, both dug up Wickliffes and Peter Martyrs wives, and
Paulus Fagius their bones after they had been long interred: Nec livor post
fata quievit. The Tombe-stone is said to be the bound of malice, and death a
supersedeas for envy and all uncharitable proceedings: yet blind zeal in
persecuting the members of Christ Jesus exceeds these bounds, and all terms of
common humanity. O unheard of cruelty, says the blessed Martyr Saint Cyp. de
laps. Saevitum est in plagas, and jam in servis Dei non torquebantur membra,
sed vulnera.
Cyprian, Their rage falls upon the stripes of Gods servants, and they now
torture not so much their members as their wounds. We may go on further,
because Popish cruelty has gone on further, and say: Saevitum est in cadavera,
saevitum est in ossa, saevitum est in cineres, saevitum est in manes: the rage
and malice of Papists against Protestants is not satisfied with their blood,
nor expireth with their life; they fall like savage Jackals upon their
carcasses, they dig up their graves, they rifle their coffins, they burn
their bones, they persecute their ghosts; and this is their charity which they
so much brag of. But I leave them, and come to the sepulcher which Abraham
bought, where the Patriarchs were laid.

And were laid in the sepulcher. Though it little import the souls of Gods
Saints in heaven what becomes of their dead corpse on earth, no more than it
concerns a newly elected King, when he has his Princely robes on him, what
becomes of his old cast suits of apparel: in which regard Saint Aug. confess.
l. 9. c. 11. Nihil long est a Deo, nec timendum mihi ille ne agnoscat in fine
saeculi unde resuscitet.
Monica told her son at her death, that she took no care where she was
interred; yielding this for a reason, It is nothing to me (says she) whether
I lie far from home, or from any Church; I am sure nothing is far from God:
neither do I fear but that he will find me at the last day, and raise up my
corpse wheresoever it lies. Yet because the bodies of Gods Saints were temples
of the holy Ghost, and served as instruments in the performance of all duties
of piety and charity; our piety and charity in some respect extends to them:
piety I say, not to worship them, for that is idolatry; not to pray to them,
for that at the best is (...), will worship, and unwarrantable devotion; not to
pray for them, for that is superstition: but to give God thanks for them, and
to expect their and our joyful resurrection: charity to preserve their good
name alive, and to bury their dead corpses, although I grant with Saint Lib. 1.
de civit. Dei, c. 12. Omnia ista curatio funeris, conditio sepultu^ae pompa
exequia^um m^gis sun^ solatia vivorum quam subsidia mortuorum. Et c. 13. Si
enim paterna vestis and annulus tanto charior est posteris, quanto erga
parents major est affectus, nullo modo spernanda sunt corpora, quae utique
multo familiarius atque conjunctius quam quaelibet indumenta gestamus.
Austine, that the care of funerals, and pomp of herses, and rites of burial
are rather comforts of the living, than helps of the dead: yet with the same
Austine I cannot but acknowledge that the bodies of our parents or friends may
challenge more affection and respect to them, than the apparel ring, or
jewel they wore, which yet we make great account of, and carefully keep for
their sake. Does not Nature her self teach us this work of mercy to the dead?
Do not some birds that are loving to man, if they spy a dead corpse in the
wood, cover it over with leaves? Does the young Phoenix (as Annal. l. 10.
Phoenici cura primo sepeliendi patris, sublato myrrhae pondere subit patrium
corpus, and in Solis templum perfert.
Tacitus writes) as soon as ever it has life, take care of burying the
parent, carrying his corpse with a quantity of Myrrh, and laying it in the
Temple of the Sun? and shall not men endued with reason and understanding do
the like not only to their parents and friends, but even to strangers and
their very enemies, especially if there be worth in them? Alexander the great
opening Cyrus Tomb, set a crown upon his Hearse, and carefully shut it again.
Hannibal gave Marcellus the Roman Consul an honorable burial, put his ashes
in a silver pot, and crowned it with a crown of gold, and sent it to his son
to interre it. (To speak nothing of Cannibals, man-eaters, and other savages)
all civil people in the world bury their dead, though in a different manner,
and with several rites. The Jews washed, the Egyptians embalmed the corpse,
the Romans burnt them with sweet perfumes, and kept the ashes in an urne or
pot: the Ethiopians curiously paint them, and lay them in a glazed coffin: the
most common and most agreeable to Scripture is interring the corpse. Moses
alludeth to it: Gen 3.19.
Dust thou art, and to dust shall thou return: and Solomon, Eccles. 12.7.
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and David, Psalm. 30.9.
What profit is there then in my blood when I go down to the pit? shall the
dust praise thee? or shall it declare thy truth? The Greeks for the most part,
and other Nations also, excepting those above named, interred their dead: and
therefore Plin not. hist. l. 2. c. 63. Haec nascentes excipit, natos alit
novissime complexa gremio jam reliqua natura abdicatos, tum maxim ut matter
operiens, nomen prorogat ti^ulis, etc.
Pliny calls the earth our tender mother, which receives us into her bosom,
when we are excluded as it were out of the world, and covers our nakedness
and shame, and guardeth us from beasts and fowls, that they offer no indignity
to our carcasses.

Now because it is to small purpose to bestow the dead in rooms under ground,
if they may not keep them, Abraham wisely provided for this: for he laid down
a valuable consideration for the field where the cave was.

Were laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money. As
Abraham here bought a field outright, and thereby assured the possession
thereof to his posterity; so by his example the Synagogue under the Law, and
the Catholic Church under the Gospel, especially in days of peace, secured
certain places for the burial of the dead, either purchased for money, or
received by deed of gift: and after they were possessed of them, sequestered
them from all other, and appropiated them to this use only; by which
sequestration and appropriation all such parcells of ground became holy, in
such sort that none might otherwise use or employ them, than for the burial of
the dead, without sacrilege or profanation. As the holy oil ran from Aarons
head to his body, and the skirts of his garments, so holiness stays not in
the Chancell as the head, but descends to the whole body of the Church and
the Churchyard as the skirt thereof.

Mistake me not, brethren, I say not that one clod of earth is holier than
another, or any one place or day absolutely, but relatively only. For as it is
superstition to attribute formal or inherent holiness to times, places,
parcells of ground, fruits of the earth, vessel, or vestments; so it is
profaneness to deny them some kind of relative sanctity, which the holy Ghost
attributes unto them in Scripture, where we read expressly of holy ground,
holy days, holy oil, and the like. To clear the point we are to distinguish
of holiness yet more particularly, which belongs 1. To God the Father,
Son, and Spirit by essence. 2. To Angels and men by participation of the
divine nature or grace. 3. To the Word and Oracles of God by inspiration. 4. To
types, figures, sacraments, rites and ceremonies by divine institution. 5. To
places, lands, and fruits of the earth, as also sacred utensils, by use and
dedication: as 1. Temples with their furniture consecrated to the service of
God. 2. Tithes and glebe lands to the maintenance of the Priests. 3.
Churchyards to the burial of the dead.



Others come off shorter, and dichotomize holy things, which say they are 1.
Sanctified, because they are holy, as God his name and attributes, etc. 2.
Holy, because they are sanctified, 1. Either by God to man, as the Word and
Sacraments. 2. Or by man to God, as Priests, Temples, Altars, Tables, etc.



Of this last kind of holy things by dedication, some are dedicated to him 1.
Immediately, as all things used in his service. 2. Mediately, as all such
things without which his service cannot be conveniently done; and here come in
Churchyards, without which, some religious works of charity cannot be done
with such convenience or decency as they ought.


The Church is as Gods house, and the yard is as the court before his door:
how then dare any defile it, or alienate it, or employ it to any secular use
for profit or pleasure?

To conclude, all Churchyards by the Ancients are termed (...), dormitories,
or dortories, wherein they lie that sleep in Jesus. Now it is most uncivil to
press into, or any way abuse the bedchamber of the living, and much more of
the dead. What are graves in this dormitory but sacred vestries, wherein we lay
up our old garments for a time, and after take them out, and resume them new
dressed and trimmed, and gloriously adorned, and made shining, and Mar. 9.3.
exceeding white as snow (so as no Fuller on earth can white them?) These
shining raiments God bestow upon us all at the last day, for the merits of the
death and burial of our Lord and Savior. Cui, etc.

THE FEAST OF PENTECOST. A Sermon preached on Whitsunday. THE LXIII. SERMON.
ATCS 2.1. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all together
with one accord in one place.


SAint Hom. in die ascens. (...).
Chrysostom, comparing the works of redemption with the works of creation,
observes, that as the Father finished the former, so the Son the later, in
six days especially: in memory whereof his dearest Spouse, the Catholic
Church, has appointed six solemnities to be kept by all Christians, with
greatest fervor of devotion, and highest elevation of religious affections.
These are Christ his 1. Virgin birth. 2. Illustrious Epiphanie. 3. Ignominious
death. 4. His powerful resurrection. 5. His glorious ascension. 6. His
gracious sending down of the holy Ghost.
The day of 1. His incarnation, by which he entered into the world. 2. His
manifestation, on which he entered upon his office of Mediator. 3. His passion,
on which he expiated our sins. 4. His resuscitation, by which he conquered
death and the grave. 5. His triumphant return into heaven, on which he took
seizin and possession of that kingdom for us. 6. His visible mission of the
holy Ghost, in the similitude of fiery cloven tongues, on which he sealed all
his former benefits to us, and us to the day of redemption.


This last festival in order of time was yet the first and chiefest in order
of dignity. For on Christ's birth day he was made partaker of our nature, but
on this we were made partakers after a sort of his: in the Epiphany one star
only stood over the house where he lay, on this twelve fiery tongues, like so
many celestial lights, appeared in the room where the Apostles were
assembled: on the day of his passion he rendered his humane spirit to God his
father, on this he sent down his divine spirit upon us: on the resurrection
his spirit quickened his natural body, on this it quickened his mystical, the
Catholic Church: on the ascension he took a pledge from us, viz. our flesh,
and carried it into heaven, on this he sent us his pledge, viz. his spirit in
the likeness of fiery tongues, with the sound of a mighty rushing wind. After
which the Spouse, as Gorrhan conceives, panted, saying, Cant. 4.16.
Awake, O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out; let my Beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant
fruits. The wind she gasped for, what was it but the spirit? and what are the
fragrant spices she wishes may flow, but the graces of the holy Ghost, which
David calls gifts for men in the eighteenth verse of the 68. Psalm? the
former part whereof may furnish the feast we lately celebrated, with a fit
antheme, Thou have ascended up on high, thou have led captivity captive: the
later may supply this present, thou have received gifts for men, yea for the
rebellious also, that the Lord God may dwell among them. Blessed be the Lord,
who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation: for on this
day Christ received gifts for his Church, the gifts of faith, hope and
charity, the gift of prayer and supplication, the gift of healing and
miracles, the gift of prophecy, the gift of tongues, and the interpretation
thereof. Verily, so many and so great are the benefits, which the anniversary
return of this day presents to us, that as if all the tongues upon the earth
had not been sufficient to utter them, a supply of new tongues was sent from
heaven to declare them in all languages. The new Testament was drawn before,
and signed with Christ's blood on good Friday; but Ephesians. 4.30. Grieve not the
holy spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption.
sealed first on this day by the holy spirit of God. Christ made his last Will
upon the cross, and thereby bequeathed unto us many fair legacies: but this
Will was not 1 Cor. 12.4, 5, 8. There are differences of administrations, but
the same Lord: and diversity of gifts, but the same spirit. For to one is
given by the same spirit, the word of wisdom, unto another the word of
knowledge, by the same spirit.
administered till this day; for the And 2 Cor. 3.8. How shall not the
ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
ministration is of the spirit.

Yea, but had not the Apostles the spirit before this day? did not our Lord
breathe on them, ( John 20.22.) the day he rose at evening, being the first day
of the week, saying, Receive ye the holy Ghost?

The learned answer, that they had indeed the spirit before, but not in such a
measure: the holy Ghost was given before according to some ghostly power and
invisible grace; but was never sent before in a visible manner: before they
received him in breath, now in fire: before he was Calv. in Act Antea respersi
erant, nunc plene imbuti.
sprinkled, but now powered on them: before they received (...), but now (...):
before authority to discharge their function, but now power to work wonders:
before they had the smell, now the substance Aug. hom. de Pent. Nunc ipsa
substantia sacri defluxit unguenti, cujus fragrantia totius orbis latitudo
impleretur; and iterum adfuit hoc die fidelibus, non per gratiam visitationis
and operationis, sed per praesentiam majestatis.
of the celestial ointment was shed on them: they heard of him before, but now
they saw and felt him 1. In their minds, by infallible direction: 2. In their
tongues, by the multiplicity of languages: 3. In their hands, by miraculous
cures.


S. Austine truly observes, that before the Apostles on this day were endued
with power from above, they never strove for the Christian faith unto blood:
when Satan winnowed them at Christ's passion they all flew away like chafe. And
though S. Peter's faith failed not, because it was supported by our Lords
prayer, Luke 22.32. yet his courage failed him in such sort, that he was foiled
by a silly damsel: but after the holy Ghost descended upon him and the rest of
the Apostles, in the sound of a mighty rushing wind, and in the likeness of
fiery cloven tongues, they were filled with grace, and enflamed with zeal,
and they mightily opposed all the enemies of the truth, and made an open and
noble profession thereof before the greatest Potentates of the world, and
sealed it with their blood, all of them save S. John; who had that privilege
that he should stay till Christ came, glorifying the Lord of life by their
valiant suffering of death for his names sake. In regard of which manifold and
powerful eff^cts of sending the spirit on this day, which were no less seen
in the flames of the Martyrs, than in the fiery tongues that lighted on the
Apostles, the Church of Christ, even from the beginning, celebrated this
festivity in most solemn manner; and not so only, but within 300. years
after Christ's death, the Fathers in the Councels of Council. Elib. c. 43. Cuncti
diem Pentecostes celebrent, qui non fecerit quasi novam heresem induxerit
pumatur.
Eliberis mounted a canon, thundering out the pain of heresy to all such as
religiously kept it not. If the Jews celebrated an high feast in memory of the
Law, on this day first proclaimed on mount Sinai; ought not we much more to
solemnize it in memory of the Gospel now promulgated on mount Sion by new
tongues sent from heaven? If we dedi^^^ peculiar festivals to God the Father
the Creator, and God the Son the Redeemer; why should not God the holy Ghost
the Sanctifier have a peculiar interest in our devotion? S. Sermon. in die Pent.
Si celebramus sanctorum solennia, quanto magis ejus a quo habuerunt ut sancti
essent, quotquot fuerunt sancti? si veneramur sanctificatos, quanto magis
sanctificatorem?
Bernard adds another twist to this cord, If we deservedly honor Saints with
festivals, how much more ought we to honor him, who makes them Saints?
especially having so good a ground for it, as is laid down in this chapter and
verse:

And when the day of Pentecost was come. As a prologue to an act, or an eeve to
an holy day, or the Parascheve to the Passover, or the beautiful gate to the
Temple; so is this preface to the ensuing narration: it presents to our
religious thoughts a threefold concurrence: 1. Of time. 2. Of place. 3. Of
affections.


Upon one and the self same day, when all the Apostles were met in one place,
and were of one mind, the spirit of unity and love descends upon them.
Complementum legis Christus, Evangelii spiritus; As the descending of the Son
was the complement of the Law, so the sending of the spirit is the complement
of the Gospel: and as God sent his Son in the fullness of time, so he sent
the spirit, (...), in the fullness of the fiftieth day. When the Apostles
number was full, and their desire and expectations full, then the spirit came
down, and filled their hearts with joy, and their tongues with (...),
Magnifica Dei facta, the wonderful works of God, verse. 11.

That your thoughts rove not at uncertainties, may it please you to pitch them
upon four circumstances. 1. The time, when. 2. The persons who, They. 3. The
affection or disposition, were with one accord. 4. The place, in one place.
1. The time was solemn, the day of Pentecost. 2. The persons eminent, the
Apostles. 3. Their disposition agreeable, (...). 4. The place convenient, in an
upper room at Jerusalem, where Christ appointed them to wait for the Act. 1.4.
promise of the father.


1. Of the time. In the Syriacke and Latin we read (...) or dies, days, in
the plural number: but in the original, (...), the day in the singular. The
Syriacke and the Latin had an eye to the whole number of days, which now
amounted unto fifty: the original designeth in the singular the precise day
which made it up fifty, the day by the access whereof to the 49. the number
of (...), or fifty, was made complete. Word for word according to the
original we should thus read my text, (...), in or upon the fulfilling of
the fiftieth day from the feast of first fruits. Metal upon metal is no good
Heraldrie; yet feast upon feast is good Divinity: especially when the one is
the type, the other the truth. For this reason (...).
Severianus conceives that our Savior was offered up for our sins on the
cross, the day and time of the day when the Paschall Lamb, according to the
Law, was to be killed, to set the face to the picture, the truth to the type,
that the body might as it were drive out the shadow, and occupy the space
thereof. And in like manner In haec verba, ut ostenderet and tum spiritum
sanctum legem tulisse, and nunc legem far.
Theophylact imagines that he sent the spirit fifty days after, when the
Jews kept a feast for the Law, to show that as then the holy Ghost proclaimed
the Law, so now also: then the law and covenant of works, now the law of faith
and covenant of grace. S. Aug. hom. de Pent Sicut 50. post pascha die lex lata
fuit manu Dei scripta in tabulis lapideis: ita spiritus, cujus officium erat
eam cordibus inscribere, condem diebus post resurrectionem Christi, qui est
pascha nostrum, implevit, quod in legis promulgatione figuratum erat.
Austine gives another relish of his own; As (says he) fifty days after
Easter the Law was given, written by the finger of God in tables of stone: so
the spirit, whose office it is to write it in the hearts of men, just so many
days after Christ's resurrection, who is our Passover, fulfilled that which was
figured in the publishing of the Law. S. Chrysostom. hom. de Pent. (...), etc.
Chrysostom strikes upon a different string, yet makes good music: others
fetched the congruitie from the Law, he from nature. What, says he, is
Pentecost? It signifies that season of the year, wherein the Jews thrust
their sickle into the corne-harvest. In like sort the Lord of the harvest
disposed that now the Apostles should put their sickle (the sickle of the Word)
into the harvest of the world and reap it. I shall not need to strain farther
for congruities, S. Cyrill and S. Ambrose give me the hint of another
synchronisme; for they affirm that on this day the Angel descended into the
poole of Bethesda, and after the troubling the water cured the sick whatsoever
the disease was. And what fitter day could have been thought upon for the holy
Ghost to descend, to bestow the gift of miraculous cures, than upon this day of
healing? I could tell you of the Jubilee, which fell upon the fiftieth year,
in which all possessions returned to their former owners, and acquittances were
given for all debts: but because the best stomachs rather desire solid than
sweet meats, I therefore content my self at this present with Calv. com. in
Act. 2. Festo die quo ingens multitudo Hierosolymae confluere solebat, editum
est miraculum quo illustrius redderetur.
Calvin his observation upon the circumstance of time. This solemnity being
next to that of the Passover, was the fittest time to make the miracle wrought
upon it more illustrious. For this reason Christ came up so often to Jerusalem
at their solemn feasts, and S. Paul made haste in his journey that he might be
there at the feast of Pentecost, to win more souls by the preaching of the
Gospel, in a time of so great confluence of people from all parts. There is no
fishing to the sea, and now it was full sea at Jerusalem, all the cities in
Palestine like so many rivers emptying themselves into it. The gift of tongues
could not at any time so fitly have been bestowed as at this, when there were
present at Jerusalem men of every nation under heaven, Acts 2.5, 6. To
convince all gaine-sayers of the miracle, What are these (say they) that speak?
Are they not Galileans? How then hear we every one speak in our own tongue
where we were borne? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and they that dwell
in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Bithynia, Phrygia and
Pamphylia, in Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of
Rome, Jews and Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in
our tongues the wonderful works of God, verse. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, As we read in
the 19. Psalm, verse. 2. Dies ad diem eructat sermonem, and nox ad noctem
ostendit scientiam; Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night shows
knowledge, or gives intelligence: so here, Lingua ad linguam eructat sermonem:
the tongues of men of all nations gave testimony to the miraculous gift of
tongues in the Apostles. It is the wisdom of State, to appoint beacons to be
set up on the highest hills, to give notice to all the Country. And Christ
himself commands us not to hide a candle under a bushel, but to set it on a
candlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house. And in this
consideration those Preachers of the glad tidings of salvation, who have had
the best foil of modesty to set off the luster of their knowledge, have yet
been desirous to deliver their Embassage from God to men in the fullest
assemblies: not to gain thereby more applause to themselves, but more souls
to God. When the ears stand thick in a corne-field, not a drop of rain
falls besides them on the ground. And this is a principal end of our
celebration of Christian feasts, to draw multitudes together to hear Christ
preaching by his Ministers, and working still miraculous cures upon the souls
of men, by the Sacraments administered in the Church. And so from the holy day,
I proceed to the sacred persons assembled on it, viz. the Apostles.

They were all together. Beza tells us of an ancient manuscript, in which he
found the substantive added to the adjective omnes, viz. Apostoli, which words
though I find not in our copies, yet by comparing this verse with the last of
the former chapter, it appears that the all here must be restrained to the
Apostles, or principally meant of them; for they were, as S. Austine sets
them Aug. sermon. de Pent. Tanquam duodecim radii solis, seu totidem lampades
veritatis totum mundum illuminantes.
forth, twelve beams of the sun of righteousness, or twelve great torches
of the truth enlightening the whole world. They were as the twelve Patriarks of
the new Testament, to be consecrated as oecumenicall Pastors throughout all
the earth: they were as the Exodus 15.27.
twelve Wels of water in Elim, from whence the crystal streams of the water
of life were to be derived into all parts: they were as the twelve Apoc. 12.1.
stars in the crown of the woman which was clothed with the sun, and the
moon under her feet: and as the twelve Apoc. 21.14.
precious stones in the foundation of the celestial Jerusalem.

The present assembly in this upper room was no other than a sacred Synod; and
in truth there can be no Synod where the Apostles or their successors are not
present, and Presidents. For all assemblies, how great soever, of Lay-persons,
called together about ordering ecclesiastical affairs, without Bishops and
Pastors, are like to Polyphemus his vast body without an eye: Monstrum
horrendum inform ingens cui lumen ademptum.

But when the Apostles and their successors, Bishops, and Prelates, and
Doctors of the Church are assembled, and all are of one accord, and bend their
endeavors one way, to settle peace and define truth, Christ will make good his
promise, to be in the Matt. 18.20. When two or three are gathered together in
my name, there am I in the midst of them. And,
midst of them, and by his spirit to lead them into John 16.13. When the
spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.
all truth.

With one accord. All the ancient and later Interpreters accord in their note
upon the word accord, that Animorum unio and concordia est optima dispositio ad
recipiendum Spiritum sanctum: that Unity and concord is the best disposition
of the mind, and preparation for the receiving of the holy Ghost. The bones in
Ezekiel were Ezekiel. 37.7, 8.
joined one to another and tied with sinews, before the wind blew upon them
and revived them: so the members of Christ must be joined in love, and coupled
with the sinews of charitable affections one toward another, before the holy
Spirit will enlive them. Mark (says S. Sermon. de Temp. Membrum amputatum non
sequitur spiritus: cum in corpore erat vivebat, precisum amittit spiritum.
Austine) in the natural body, how if a member be cut off, the soul
presently leaves it; while it was united to the rest of the members it lived,
but as soon as ever it was severed, it became a dead piece of flesh: so it is
in the mystical body of Christ; those who sever themselves by schism or
faction from the body and their fellow members, deprive themselves of the
influence of the holy Spirit. Peruse the records of the Church, and you shall
find for the most part that faction has bred heresy. When discontented
Churchmen of eminent parts sided against their Bishops and Superiors, Gods
spirit left them, and they became authors of damnable heresies. This was
Novatus his case after he made a faction against Cyprian: Donatus after he
made a faction against Meltiades: Aerius after he made a schism against
Eustatius: and do we not see it daily in our Separatists, who no sooner leave
our Church, but the spirit of God quite leaves them, and they fall from
Brownisme to Anabaptisme, from Anabaptisme to Familisme, and into what not? The
Church and Commonwealth, like the Plin. l. 2. not. hist. c. 105. Lapis
Tyrrhenus grandis innatat, comminutus mergitur.
Lapis Tyrrhenus, while they are whole swim in all waters; but if they be
broken into factions, or crumbled into sects and schisms, they will soon
sink, if not drown. And so I pass, (...) from their unanimitie of affection,
to their concurrence in place.

In one place. The last circumstance is the place, which was an upper chamber
in Jerusalem. The Apostles and Disciples stayed at Jerusalem after the
ascension of our Lord, partly in obedience to his Acts 1.4.
command, which was not to depart out of Jerusalem till they were endued with
power from above: partly to fulfill the prophecy, the Esaias 2.3.
Law shall go out of Sion, and the word of God out of Jerusalem. They kept all
together out of love, and for more safety; and they took an upper chamber
that they might be more private and retired, or because in regard of the great
confluence of people at this feast, they could not hire the whole house: or as
Bernardinus conceives, to teach us that the spirit of Com. in Act. Ut discamus
quod datur spiritus iis qui se ab imis attollunt, and reru^ sublimium
contemplatione ut cibo se oblectant.
God is given to such as raise up themselves from the earth, and give
themselves to the contemplation of high and heavenly mysteries.

Now to descend from this higher chamber, and to come near to you by some
application of this text: It will be to little purpose to hear of the Apostles
preparation this day, if we prepare not our selves accordingly: to discourse
of their entertainment, and receiving the holy Spirit, if we receive him not
into our hearts. It is a mockery, as Fulgentius has it, Ejus diem celebrare,
cujus lucem oderimus, To keep the day of the Spirit, if we hate his light. If
we desire to celebrate the feast of the Spirit, and by his grace worthily
receive the Sacrament of Christ his flesh, we must imitate the Apostles and
Disciples in each circumstance.

1. Rely upon Gods promises by a lively faith, of sending the spirit of his
Son into our hearts, and patiently expect the accomplishment of it many days
as they did.

2. Ascend into an upper chamber, that is, remove our selves as far as we
can from the earth, and set our affections upon those things that are above.

3. Meet in one place, that is the Church; to frequent the house of God, and
when we are bid, not to make excuses, but to present our selves at the Lords
board.

4. Not only meet in one place, but as the Apostles did with one accord, to
reconcile all differences among our selves, and to purge out all gall of
malice, and in an holy sympathy of devotion, to join sighs with sighs, and
hearts with hearts, and hands with hands, and lifting up all together with one
accord, sing, Come holy Ghost: so as this day is Pentecost, in like manner this
place shall be as the upper room where they were assembled, and we as the
Apostles and Disciples, and the Word which has now been preached unto us, as
the sound of that mighty rushing wind which filled that room: and after we
have worthily celebrated the feast of the Spirit, and administered the Sacrament
of our Lords body and blood, we shall feel the effects of both in us: viz.
more light in our understanding, more warmth in our affections, more fervor in
our devotions, more comfort in our afflictions, more strength in temptations,
more growth in grace, more settled peace of conscience, and unspeakable joy in
the holy Ghost: To whom with the Father and the Son be ascribed, etc.

THE SYMBOL OF THE SPIRIT. THE LXIV. SERMON.
ACTS 2.2. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.


SAint Luke in the precedent verse gives us the name, and in this the ground
of the solemn feast we are now come to celebrate, with such religious rites as
our Church has prescribed, according to the presidents of the first and best
ages. The name is (...), the feast of the fiftieth day from Easter; the ground
thereof the miraculous apparition, and (if I may so speak) the Epiphany of the
holy Spirit in the sound of a mighty rushing wind, and the light of fiery
cloven tongues shining on the heads of the Apostles, who stayed at Jerusalem,
according to our Lords command, in expectation of the promise of the holy
Ghost, which was fulfilled then in their eyes, and now in our ears, and I hope
also in our hearts. After God the Father had manifested himself by the worlds
creation, and the works of nature, and God the Son by his incarnation, and
the works of grace; it was most convenient, that in the third place the third
person should manifest himself, as he did this day by visible descension, and
works of wonder. Before in the third of Matthew at the Epiphany of our
Savior, the Spirit appeared in the likeness of a dove; but here (as ye
hear) in the similitude of fiery cloven tongues, to teach us, that we ought to
be like doves, without gall in prosecution of injury done to our selves; but
like Seraphins, all fire, in vindicating Gods honor. This moral
interpretation Saint Greg. tert. pas. Omnes quos implet, and columbae
simplicitate mansuetos, and igne zeli ardentes exhibet. Et ib. Intus arsit
ignibus amoris, and for as accensus est zelo severitatis: causam populi apud
Deum lachrymis, causam Dei apud populum gladiis allegabat, etc.
Gregory makes of these mystical apparitions: All whom the spirit fills he
makes meek by the simplicity of doves, and yet burning with the fire of
zeal. Just of this temper was Moses, who took somewhat of the dove from the
spirit, and somewhat of the fire. For being warm within with the fire of love,
and kindling without with the zeal of severity, he pleaded the cause of the
people before God with tears, but the cause of God before the people with
swords. Sed sufficit diei suum opus, sufficient for the day will be the work
thereof: sufficient for this audience will be the interpretation of the sound:
the mystical exposition of the wind which filled the house where the Apostles
sat, will fill up this time. And lest my meditations upon this wind should
pass away like wind, I will fasten upon two points of special observation, 1.
The object vehement, the sound of a mighty rushing wind. 2. The effect
correspondent, filled the whole house.


Each part is accompanied with circumstances: 1. With the circumstance of 1.
The manner, suddenly. 2. The sourse or terminus a quo, from heaven.
2. With the circumstance of 1. The place, the house where: 2. The persons,
they: 3. Their posture, were sitting.

1. Hearken suddenly, there came on the sudden. 2. To what? a sound. 3. From
whence? from heaven. 4. What manner of sound? as of a mighty rushing wind. 5.
Where? filling the room where they were sitting.


That suddenly when they were all quiet there should come a sound or noise, and
that from heaven, and that such a vehement sound as of a mighty rushing wind,
and that it should fill the whole room where they were, and no place else,
seems to me a kind of sequence of miracles. Every word in this Text is like a
cock, which being turned, yields abundance of the water of life, of which we
shall taste hereafter.

I observe first in general, that the Spirit presented himself both to the
eyes and to the ears of the Apostles: to the ears, in a noise like a trumpet
to proclaim him: to the eyes, in the shape of tongues like lights to show him.

Next I observe, that as there were two sacred signs of Christ's body, 1.
Bread, 2. Wine.
so there are two symboles, and (if I may so speak) sacraments of the Spirit:
1. Wind, 2. Fire.
Behold the correspondency between them; the spirit is of a nobler and more
celestial nature than a body: in like manner, the elements of wind and fire
come nearer the nature of heaven than bread and wine, which are of a more
material and earthly nature. And as the elements sort with the mysteries they
represent, so also with our senses to which they are presented. For the grosser
and more material elements, bread and wine, are exhibited to our grosser and
more carnal senses, the taste and touch: but the subtiler and less material,
wind and fire, to our subtiler and more spiritual senses, the eyes and ears.
Of the holy forms of bread and wine, their significancie and efficacy, I have
heretofore discoursed at large; at this present by the assistance of the holy
Spirit I will spend my breath upon the sacred wind in my Text; and hereafter,
when God shall touch my tongue with a fiery coal from his Altar, explicate the
mystery of the fiery cloven tongues.

After the nature and number of the symboles, their order in the third place
comes to be considered: first, the Apostles hear a sound, and then they see
the fiery cloven tongues. And answerable hereunto in the fourth verse we read,
that they were filled with the holy Ghost, and then they began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. For Mat. 12.34.
out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. With the Romans 10.10.
heart man believes unto righteousness, and then with the tongue he
confesses unto salvation. My Psalm. 45.1.
heart (says David) is enditing a good matter, and my tongue is the pen of a
ready writer: first the heart enditeth, and then the tongue writes. They who
stay not at Jerusalem till they are endued with power from above, and receive
the promise of the Father, but presently will open their mouths, and try to
loosen the strings of their fiery tongues; I mean, they who continue not in
the schools of the Prophets, till they have learned the languages and arts,
and have used the ordinary means to obtain the gifts and graces of the holy
Spirit, and yet will open their mouths in the Pulpit, and exercise the gift of
their tongues, do but fill the ears of their auditors with a sound, and their
zealous fiery cloven tongues serve but to put fire, and make a rent in the
Church of God. The organ pipes must be filled with wind before the instrument
give any sound: our mouths, lips, and tongues are the instruments and organs
of God, and before they are filled with the wind in my Text, they cannot sound
out (...), his wondrous works, whereof this is one, as follows:

And suddenly, (...). Every circumstance, like grains in gold scales, adds
to the weight. Oecumen. in Act. c. 2 (...).
Oecumenicus conceives that this sound came on the sudden to scare the
Apostles, and out of fear or amazement to draw them together. And indeed this
sudden noise in this upper room, the Apostles sitting still, and there being
no wind abroad stirring, seems not less strange than the sudden calm after
Christ rebuked the Mat. 8.26.
wind and the sea. Winds are not raised to the height on the sudden, but grow
more and more blustering by degrees: this became blustering on the sudden, and,
which is more strange, it was (...), quasi (...), from (...) privative, and
(...), appareo, without any cause appearing. To hear a thunder clap in summer,
when we see a black cloud overcasting the whole sky; or a report, where we
know there is a canon mounted, no way amazeth us: but to hear thundering in a
clear sunshine, when there is no cloud to be seen in all the sky; or the
report like that of a canon, where there is no piece of ordnance; or a sudden
light in a dark room, without lamp, candle, torch, or fire, somewhat
affrighteth and amazeth us: so it was here, a noise is heard as of a mighty
rushing wind, yet no wind; or if a wind, a wind created of nothing, without any
cause or prejacent matter. There is a great controversy among the Philosophers
about the causes of winds. Some, as Democritus imagined, that many atoms, that
is, such small bodies and motes as we see in the beams of the Sun meeting
together, and striving for place, stirred the air, and thereby made winds:
others, as Agrippa, that the evil spirits ruling in the air, as they raise
tempests, so also they cause winds. Aristotle endeavors to demonstrate that
the rising up of dry exhalations from the earth generateth the winds, which so
long rage as the matter continues, after that fails the wind lies. The
Divines resolve with Psalm. 135.7.
David, that God draws them out of his hidden treasures. To which our Savior
seems to have reference: The John 3.8.
wind blows where it lists, and thou hear the sound thereof, but know
not whence it comes, that is, originally:

There came a sound. Some will have this sound to be an echo, or a sound at
second hand, because so it will be a fitter emblem of the Apostles preaching
to the people, and ours to you. For first, the sound of the Gospel comes from
God to us, and then it rebounds from us to you: but the word in the original
is not (...), an echo, but (...), a sound: besides, the echo comes by
reverberation from below, but this sound came from above.

From heaven. Lorinus and other Commentatours are of opinion, that heaven here,
as in many other Texts of Scripture, is put for the air: as God is said to
Genesis 7.11.
open the windows of heaven, and to rain fire and Genesis 19.24.
brimstone from heaven. But I see no reason why (...) here may not signify the
efficient cause, and heaven be taken properly. For though the sense of hearing
judged it, that the sound began but in the air, yet it was there made without
any apparent cause: and why may not this sound be as well from heaven properly,
as we read of a voice from heaven, saying, Mat. 3.17.
This is my well beloved Son in whom I am well pleased: and another voice
from heaven, saying, John 12.28.
I have both glorified it (my name) and will glorify it again: and yet a
third voice from heaven, saying, Blessed are the Rev. 14 13.
dead which dye in the Lord? But what manner of sound was this?

As of a rushing mighty wind, or rather a rushing blast. For in the original
it is (...), not (...), ruentis flatus, not venti. As our breath differs from
our spirit and breathing parts, so the spirit which the Apostles received, was
not the holy Ghost himself the third person, but some extraordinary gifts and
graces of the spirit. Though Peter Lumbard the great Master of the sentences
seemed to incline to that opinion, that the Apostles received the very person
of the holy Ghost; yet this conceit of his is pricked through with an
obelisque, and a magistro hic non tenetur by the later Schoolmen, who rightly
distinguish between the substance of the spirit and the gifts. The infinite
substance neither is nor can be imparted to any creature, but the finite
graces, whereof they were only capable. The Law and the Gospel both came to the
ears of men by a sound, the one from Sinai, the other from Sion; that was
delivered in thundering and lightening, with darkness and an earthquake, this
in a sound of a gale of wind, and in the likeness of shining tongues, the
Apostles sitting still, the place being filled, but not shook with the blast.
As in lessons skilfully pricked, the musical notes answer to the matter of the
ditty; so the manner of the publishing of the Law and Gospel was correspondent
to the matter contained in them; that was proclaimed in a dreadful manner,
this in a comfortable. For the Romans 4.15.
Law works wrath, but the Gospel peace: the Law fear, the Gospel hope: the
Law an obscure, the Gospel a more clear and evident knowledge: according to
that sacred aphorism of Saint Ambrose, Umbra in Lege, imago in Evangelio,
veritas in coelo; there was a shadow in the Law, an image in the Gospel, the
truth it self in heaven. Moses himself quaked at the giving of the Law, but
we read not that the Apostles were terrified, but exceedingly comforted at the
receiving of the Gospel: as the room was filled with the blast, so their
hearts with joy.

And it filled the place where they were sitting. The Apostles expected the
fulfilling of Christ's promise, and it is very likely that they were praying on
their knees: yet they might be truly said (...), which our translators render
sitting. For the word in the original imports only a settled abode, as it is
taken in the verse following, There appeared cloven tongues like fire, (...),
and it sat upon each of them. Sitting (as the word is taken in our language)
is a kind of posture of man's body, which cannot be imagined either in fire, or
tongues: the meaning therefore is no more, than it abode or rested on them.

Thus have I peeled the bark, let us now suck the juice: we have viewed the
engraving on the outside of the cup, let us now drink the celestial liquor,
and relish the spiritual meaning couched under the letter. The later
Commentatours for the most part (like Apothecaries boys) gather the broad
leaves and white flowers that are found on the top of the water; but the
ancient (like skillful Indians) dive deep to the bottom, and from thence take
up pearls.

1. They observe that God uses signs to strike our senses, thereby to stir
us up, that we may give more heed to that which he then fore-warneth us of, or
at the present works in us. Of signs in Scripture we find three sorts: 1.
Irae, of Gods anger, as extraordinary earthquakes, fire and brimstone falling
from heaven, and other prodigious events. 2. Potentiae, of his power, or rather
omnipotency, as miracles. 3. Gratiae, of grace and favor, and these were 1.
Significantia tantum, such as signified, or prefigured grace only, as types. 2.
Obsignantia, such as seal unto us, and actually exhibit grace, as sacraments.



The first sort are praeter naturam, the second contra naturam, the third supra
naturam.

The signs here were transeunt only, as the burning Exodus 3.2.
bush, and the Mat. 3.16.
dove in the likeness whereof the spirit descended; and therefore could not be
sacraments in the proper acception of the word: yet are they to be reduced to
the third kind of signs, signa gratiae. Strange accidents for the most part
fore-shew strange events: and as many signs are miraculous, so many miracles
are significant. In Sicilie the sea water began to sweeten a little before the
deposing the cruel tyrant Plin. not. hist. l. 2. c. 97. Eo die quo pulsus est
Dionysius regno, mare dulcescebat in portu.
Dionysius: in like manner Domitian dreamed that he saw a head of gold rise up
upon the nape of his neck, which fore-shewed that a better head of that
Monarchy should succeed him. Before the civil war between Caesar and Pompey,
there were seen two Plin. l. 2. not. hist. c. 83. In agro Mutinensi duo montes
inter se concurrebant crepitu maximo assultantes.
mountains running one at the other in the field of Mutina; and to show that
Caesar should have the better at the beginning of the war, there grew in the
Capitol on the sudden a laurel tree at the foot of his statue. Before the
destruction of Jerusalem, there was seen a star in the sky like Joseph. de
bell. Jud. l. 7. c. 12. Supra civitatem stetit sydus simile gladio, and per
annum perseveravit.
a drawn sword, perpendicularly hanging over the City. And not to build upon
the sandy foundation of humane Histories, the sacred Story affords the like.
Before the true bread descended from heaven, Manna rained from heaven upon the
Israelites. The water issuing out of the rock that was struck, fore-shewed
the fountain for sin and uncleanness, which was opened, when the side of
Christ the true rock was struck and pierced by the spear of the soldier: the
drowning of Pharaoh and all his host in the red sea, the destruction of the
Devil and all our ghostly enemies in the blood of our Redeemer: the going
back of the Sun in the dial of Ahaz, the setting back the finger in the
dial of Hezekiahs life: the appearing of a new star to the Sages, the rising
of a new light in the world, to lighten the Gentiles, and to be the glory of
the people Israel: the eclipse of the Sun at Christ's death, the obscuration
of the divine majesty in the Son of God for a time: the great draught of fish
which Saint Peter took after Christ's resurrection, the happy success of him
and the rest of the Apostles, who were fishers of men, and caught many
thousands at one draught in the net of the Gospel. There fell scales from S.
Paul's eyes, before God drew from the eyes of his understanding the filme of
ignorance and blind zeal: and here, before the Apostles were filled with the
holy Ghost, and spoke with diverse tongues, the room where they abode was
filled with a mighty rushing wind, and there appeared in the air fiery cloven
tongues.

But what did the suddenness of it betoken?

Suddenly. The Fathers read three lectures upon this circumstance, teaching
that the motions and operations of the Spirit are 1. Speedy, 2. Free, 3. Come
and gone in an instant.
The first is read us by St. Ambrose, Spiritus nescit tarda molimina, the
Spirit is quick in operation. As the lightening passes in an instant from
East to West, because it finds no resistance; so the work of grace in the
heart is suddenly done, especially for the reason given by St. Austine, Because
no hard heart can repel or refuse it: for the first work of grace is to take
away the stone out of the heart; which being taken away, it presently receives
the Spirits impressions. Who more averse from the Christian faith than St.
Paul? yet in an instant by a vision from heaven he is changed from persecuting
Saul to preaching Paul. At one Sermon of St. Peter many thousand souls were
gained. And in Dioclesians time, after the edict set up in the market place for
the utter extirpation of the Christian Religion, the whole world on the sudden
turned Christian. When God knocks by effectual grace, the iron gates of the
hardest heart fly open on the sudden.

The second lesson is read by St. Gregory, That grace is free, and not
procured by any merit of ours. Here was no matter of this wind, nor natural
cause of this sound; no more can there be assigned any meritorious cause in us
of supernatural grace. Who can cause the sun to rise, or the wind to blow,
or the deaw to fall? much less can any procure by his merits either the beams
of the sun of righteousness to shine, or the gales of the spirit to blow, or
the deaw of grace to fall upon him. Therefore the Synod at Diospolis condemns
them for Heretics, who affirmed Gratiam Dei secundum merita hominum dari;
that the grace of God is given according to man's merits. And the Synod at
Arausica pronounced an Anathema against such as teach, that man begins, and
God perfects: Whosoever (say they) teach, that to him that asks, seeks, and
knocks, etc. Council. Arausic. c. 6. Si quis sine gratia Dei credentibus,
volentibus, pulsantibus, etc.
grace is given, and not that by the infusion and inspiration of the holy
Spirit this is wrought in us, that we believe, ask, or knock, gain-sayeth the
Apostle demanding, what have thou that thou have not received?

The third lesson is Origens, That good motions are as suddenly gone as they
come. The Spouse in the Canticles on the sudden finds her husband, and on the
sudden loses him; which I call God to witness (says Orig. in Cant. Conspicit
Sponsa Sponsum, qui conspectus statim abscessit, and frequenter hoc in toto
carmine facit, quod nisi quis patiatur non potest intelligere: saepe, Deus est
testis, Sponsum mihi adventate conspexi, and mecum esse, and subito recedentem
invenire non potui.
Origin) I my self have sensible experience in my meditations upon this book.
And who of us in his private devotions finds not the like? Sometimes in our
divine conceptions, contemplations, and prayers, we are as it were on float,
sometimes on the sudden at an ebb; sometimes we are carried with full sail,
sometimes we stick as it were in the haven. The use we are to make hereof is,
when we hear the gales of the Spirit rise, to hoise up our sails; to listen
to the sound when we first hear it, because it will be soon blown over; to
cherish the sparks of grace, because if they be not cherished, they will soon
dye.

There came a sound. Death entered in at the windows, that is, the eyes (says
Origin) but life at the ears. Gal. 1.8.
For the just shall live by faith, and faith comes by hearing. The sound is
not without the wind; for the Spirit ordinarily accompanies the preaching of
the Word: neither is the wind without the sound. Away then with Anabaptisticall
Enthustiasts, try the spirits whether they be of God or no by the Word of God:
To the Esaias 8.20.
Law and to the testimony (says the Prophet Esaias) If they speak not according
to this word, it is because there is no light in them: And if we (says the
Apostle) or an Angel from heaven preach unto you any other Gospel than what ye
have received, that is, (says St. Aug. contr. lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 6.
Praeterquam quod in Scripturis legalibus, and Evangelicis accepistis, Anathema
sit.
Austine) than what is contained in the Prophetical and Apostolical writings,
let him be accursed.

From heaven. This circumstance affords us a threefold doctrine:

1. That the Spirit has a dependence on the Son, and proceeds from him: for
the Spirit descended not till after the Son ascended, who both commanded his
Disciples to stay at Jerusalem, and wait for the promise of the Father, which
ye have Act. 1.4.
heard (says he) from me: and promised after his departure to send the John
15.26. When the comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father.
Act. 1.5. Ye shall be baptized with the holy Ghost, not many days hence.
spirit, and accordingly sent him ten days after his ascension with the sound
of a mighty wind in the likeness of fiery cloven tongues.

2. That the Gospel is of divine authority. As the Law came from heaven, so the
Gospel; and so long as we preach Gods word, ye still hear sonum de coelo, a
sound from heaven. Thus Lactan. instit. l. 3. c. 30. Ecce vox de coelo
veritatem docens, and sole ipso clarius lumen ostendens.
Lactantius concludes in the end of his third book of divine institutions, How
long shall we stay (says he) till Socrates will know any thing, or Anaxagoras
find light in darkness, or Democritus draw up the truth from the bottom of a
deep Well, or Empedocles enlarge the narrow paths of his senses, or Arcesilas
and Carneades, according to their sceptick doctrine, see, feel, or perceive
any thing? Behold a voice from heaven teaching us the truth, and discovering
unto us a light brighter than the sun.

3. That the doctrine of the Gospel is not earthly, but of a heavenly nature,
that it teaches us to frame our lives to a heavenly conversation, that it
mortifieth our fleshly lusts, stifleth ambitious desires, raises our mind from
the earth, and makes us heavenly in our thoughts, heavenly in our affections,
heavenly in our hopes and desires. For albeit there are excellent moral and
politic precepts in it, directing us to manage our earthly affairs; yet the
maine scope and principal end thereof is, to bring the Kingdom of heaven unto
us by grace, and us into it by glory. This a mere sound cannot do: therefore
it is added,

As of a rushing mighty wind. This blast or wind is a sacred symbol of the
Spirit, and there is such a manifold resemblance between them, that the same
word, (in Hebrew (...) in Greek (...), in Latin spiritus) signifies both:
what so like as wind to the Spirit?

1. As the wind blows where it John 3.8.
lists, so the Spirit inspireth whom he pleases.

2. As we feel the wind, and hear it, yet see it not; so we hear of the
Spirit in the word, and feel him in our hearts, yet see him not.

3. As breath comes from the heat of our bowels; so the third person, as the
Schools determine, proceeds from the heat of love in the Father and the Son.

4. As the wind purges the floor, and cleanses the air, so the Spirit
purifieth the heart.

5. As in a hot summers day nothing so refreshes a traveller as a cool blast
of wind; so in the heat of persecutions, and heart burning sorrow of
afflictions, nothing so refreshes the soul as the comfort of the Spirit, who
is therefore styled Paracletus, the Comforter.

6. As the wind in an instant blows down the strongest towers and highest
trees; so the Spirit overthrowes the strongest holds of Satan, and humbles
the haughtiest spirit.

7. As the wind blowing upon a garden, carries a sweet smell to all parts
whither it goes; so the Spirit blows upon, and opens the flowers of
Paradise, and diffuseth the savor of life unto life through the whole Church.

8. As the wind drives the ship through the waves of the sea, and carries it
to land; so the gales of Gods Spirit carry us through the troublesome waves of
this world, and bring us into the haven where we would be. Cui cum Patre, and
Filio sit laus, etc.

THE MYSTERY OF THE FIERY CLOVEN TONGUES. THE LXV. SERMON.
ACTS 2.3. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it
sat upon each of them.


AMong the golden rules of Cael. Rodig. lib. antiq. lect. Nunquam de Deo sine
lumine loquendum.
Pythagoras so much admired by antiquity, this was one, that we ought not to
speak of God without light: the meaning of which precept was not, that we
ought not to pray to God, or speak of him in the night, or the dark; but that
the nature of God is dark to us, and that we may not presume to speak thereof
without some divine light from heaven. Nothing may be confidently or safely
spoken of him, which has not been spoken by him. In which regard Salv. de
gubern. lib. 1. Tanta est Majestatis sacrae, and tam tremenda reverentia, ut
non solum illa quae contra religionem nostram dicuntur horrete, sed etiam quae
pro religione ipsi dicimus cum grandi metu dicere debeamus.
Salvianus professes, that he wrote in defense of the true religion in fear
and trembling. To the end therefore that the Apostles, who were appointed to be
Pastores pastorum, Pastors of pastors, and Doctors of Divinity through the
whole world, might not speak of him who dwells in a light which none can
approach unto, without light; the holy Ghost on this day cast his beams upon
them, shining in the fiery cloven tongues. The tongues appeared cloven (says
Saint Bernard. sermon. de Pent. Sunt dispertitae linguae propter multiplices
cogitationes, sed earum multiplicitas, and uno lumine veritatis, and uno
charitatis fervore fit tanquam ignis.
Bernard) to represent the multiplicity of thoughts, yet the multiplicity of
them shined in one light of truth, and one fervor of charity, as it were one
fire. There appeared new lightnings (says C^rysol. sermon. de Pent. Nova lucis
fulgura corusc^runt, and micantium splendour linguaru^: igneae ut scirent quod
loquerentur, linguae ut loquerentur quod scirent.
Chrysologus) in the air, and the luster of shining tongues: shining to give
them light that they might know what they spoke, and tongues to give them
eloquence, whereby they might utter what they knew. This apparition as it was
very strange, so to outward appearance also most dreadful; for it was an
apparition of a spirit, and that in fire, and this fire cast it self into the
shape of tongues, and these tongues were cloven. Of all sights, apparitions of
spirits most affright us: of all apparitions of spirits, those in fire most
dazzle our eyes: and never fire before seen in these shapes sitting upon the
heads of any. Yet was it a most comfortable apparition, because it was the
manifestation of the Comforter himself. The Spirit was no evil spirit, but
the holy Ghost: the fire was no consuming, but only an enlightening flame: the
tongues proclaimed not war, but spoke peace to the Apostles: neither did the
cleaving of them in sunder betoken the spirit of contradiction or division
amongst them, but the diversity of languages wherewith they were furnished:
neither did the fire sitting on them, singe their hair, but rather crown
their heads with gifts and graces befitting the teachers of the whole world.
Let the seeming and outward terror then of the signs serve to stir up your
attention, to listen to what the tongues speak unto you, and ye shall find
the fire of the spirit at your hearts, to enlighten your thoughts, and inflame
your affections, and purge out the dross of your natural corruptions.

Lo here 1. An apparition of tongues. 2. Tongues of fire. 3. Fire sitting.
1. Tongues cloven and floating in the air, a strange sight. 2. Tongues as of
fire, a strange matter. 3. Fire sitting, a strange posture.


Of which before I can freely discourse, I must loosen three knots which I
find tied upon the words of my text: 1. By Grammarians. 2. By Philosophers. 3.
By Divines.


The first is, how does (...), or sedit in the singular number, agree with
(...), or linguae in the plural?

The second, whether was the miracle in the tongues of the Apostles, or in the
ears of the hearers? For either way it might come to pass, that men of
several languages might hear them speak in their several tongues the
wonderful works of God.

The third, how was the holy Ghost united to these tongues? hypostatically or
sacramentally?

The first knot is thus untyed; either that there is an error in our copies,
vitio scriptoris, writing (...) for (...) for a, or that (...) is to be
construed with (...), ignis, not (...), and it sat, that is the fire, upon
each of them.

The second is thus dissolved; the miracle was in the tongues of the Apostles:
for Mark. 16.17.
Christ promised that they should speak with new tongues, not that their
hearers should hear with new ears. Ye (says Act. 1.5.
Christ) shall be baptized with the holy Ghost, and with fire, not many days
hence: and accordingly the Apostles saw fiery cloven togues, not cloven ears;
and the fire 1 Cor. 14.2.
sat upon them, it licked not the ears of their auditors. Moreover, it is
evident out of the Epistle to the Corinthians, that many who were endued with
the gift of tongues, might and did use it in the assembly of the faithful,
when they that heard them understood them not, which could not be if the
miraculous gift had been in their ears, and not in their teachers tongues.

The third knot is thus loosened: the holy Ghost was united to these tongues,
neither hypostatically nor sacramentally, but symbolically only. If he had
been united to them hypostatically, the Apostles might and ought to adore the
Spirit in them, and the fire might as truly have been said the holy Ghost, as
the man Christ to be God. Neither were the wind and fire Sacraments, because no
seals of the covenant, no conduits of saving grace, of no permanent or
perpetual use. S. Tract. 99. in Johan. Non magis ad unitatem personae spiritui
sancto hic ignis fuit conjunctus, ut ex illo and Deo una persona constaret,
quam columba, Matthew. 3. ista enim facta sunt de creatura serviente, non de ipsa
dominante natura.
Austine thus resolves, This fire cut out as it were into several portions
like tongues, was no otherwise united to the holy Ghost than the Dove, Matthew.
3. neither of which was so assumed, as that of it and God one person consisted:
the Spirit in these apparitions uses the creature, but united not himself
unto it personally or substantially.

And there appeared. In the original (...), there were seen: for it was no
delusion of sense, but a true and real apparition: the Apostles with their
eyes beheld them, and with their tongues testified the truth of this apparition
of tongues. False religions, such as the Pagan and Popish, make use of false
apparitions and lying wonders, whereby they bleare the eyes, and seduce the
souls of the simple: but the true religion, as it disalloweth all sophistical
arguments and false shows of reason, so also it disavoweth all false
apparitions and deceivable signs. The witch at Endor raised up a man, or
rather a spirit, in the likeness of Samuel, who never was seen after that day
he communed with Saul: but those whom our Savior raised lived many days if
not years after. Conjurers and Inchanters set before their guests dainty
dishes in show and appearance, but their greater hunger after them is an
evident demonstration, that the Devil all the while fed their fancies with
Idaeas and resemblances, and not their stomachs with solid meats: but our Lord
when he Joh. 6.10, 11, 12, 13.
multiplied the loaves and fishes, he gave this sensible and undeniable proof
of the truth of this miracle, both by saturitie in the stomachs of the people,
and by substantial remnants thereof in the baskets. When they were filled
(says the Evangelist) he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that
remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and
filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which
remained over and above to them that had eaten.

Cloven tongues. The holy Ghost which now first appeared in the likeness of
tongues, moved the tongues of all the Prophets that have spoken since the world
began. For the 2 Pet. 1.21.
prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke
as they were moved by the holy Ghost. Of all the parts of the body God
especially requires two, the heart and the tongue; the heart whereby Romans
10.10.
man believes unto righteousness, and the tongue whereby he makes confession
unto salvation: the heart to love God, the tongue to praise him. Out of which
consideration the Heathen, as Plutarch observes, dedicated the Peach-tree to
the Deity, because the fruit thereof resembles the heart of man, and the
leaf his tongue. And to teach us that the principal use of our tongue is to
sound out the praises of our maker, the Hebrew calls the tongue, Cobod, that
is, glory, as, My heart was glad, Psalm. 16.9. and 30.13 and 57.9. Buxtorph.
Epit. radic.
and (...), my tongue also (Hebrew my glory also) rejoices. They who glorify
not God with their tongue, may be truly said to have no tongue in the Hebrew
language: and verily they deserve no tongues, who make them not silver trumpets
to sound out the glory of God. And if such forfeit their tongues, how much more
do they who whet them against God and his truth; whose mouths are full of
cursing and bitterness, direful imprecations and blasphemous oaths? These
have fiery tongues, but not kindled from heaven; but rather, as S. Chap. 3.6.
James speaks, set on fire of hell: and their tongues also are cloven by
schism, faction, and contention, not as these in my text for a mystical
signification.

Cloven. Some by cloven understand linguas bifidas, two-forked tongues, and
they will have them to be an emblem of discretion and serpentine wisdom:
others linguas dissectas, slit tongues, like the tongues of such birds as are
taught to speak; and these conceive them to have been an emblem of
eloquence. For such kind of tongues Hieroglyph. l. 33.
Pierius affirms, that the Heathen offered in sacrifice to Mercury their god
of eloquence; and they made them after a sort fiery, by casting them into the
fire, ad expurgandas perperam dictorum labes, to purge out the dross of vain
discourses: (...). In the original it is (...), tongues parted at the top, but
joined at the root: and they represented (says In Act. Quia in proximo
debebant dividi in omnes terras.
Gorrhan) the dispersion of the Apostles, which after ensued, into all
countries. These tongues were not of fire, but

As it were of fire. The matter of which these tongues consisted was not gross
and earthly, but aeriall, or rather heavenly, like the fire which Exodus 3.2.
Moses saw in the bush: for as that, so this had the light, but not the burning
heat of fire. It is not said of fires in the plural, but of fire in the
singular number, because as the silver trumpets were made all of one piece, so
these twelve tongues were made of one fiery matter, to illustrate the
diversity of gifts proceeding from the same spirit.

And it sat. Sitting in the proper sense is a bodily gesture, and agrees not
to tongues or fire; yet because it is a gesture of permanencie or continuance,
the word is generally used in the original for (...), Chrysostom. in Act. 2. (...).
signifying to abide or reside: and so it may express unto us the continuance
of these gifts of the Spirit in the Apostles, and may put us in mind of our
duty, which is to sit to our preaching, and continue in the labors of the
ministry. Give 1 Timothy 4.13, 14, 15.
attendance (says the Apostle) to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with
the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate upon these things, give
thy self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.

Upon each of them. Whether these tongues entered into the mouths of the
Apostles, as Amphilochius writes of S. Basil, or rested upon their heads, as
S. Cyril imagined; whence some derive the custom of Lorinus in Act. c. 2.
imposition of hands upon the heads of those who are consecrated Bishops, or
ordained Priests, it is not evident out of the text; but this is certain and
evident that it sat upon each of them. It sat not upon Peter only, but upon
the rest as well as him: S. Chrysostom says, upon the Chrysostom. in act. c. 2.
(...).
hundred and twenty that were assembled in that upper room: those who say
least, affirm that it rested upon all the Apostles. For howsoever the Papists
take all occasions to advance S. Peter above the rest of the Apostles, that the
Roman See might be advanced through him, (as Hortensius the Orator extolled
eloquence to the skies, that he might be lifted up thither with her:) yet the
Scripture gives him no pre-eminence here or elsewhere: for Christ delivers

ye loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

with as full commission as his Father sent him. All their names shine in the
Apoc. 21.14.
foundation and gates of the heavenly Jerusalem: and here in my text fiery
cloven tongues sat upon each of them.

And there appeared unto them, etc. As in the Sacrament of Christ's body, so in
these symbols of the spirit we are to consider two things.

1. The signs, or outward elements. 2. The thing signified by them.
Of the signs ye have heard heretofore: hold out, I beseech you, your
religious attention to the remainder of the time, and ye shall hear in brief
of the thing signified by them. Miracles for the most part in holy Scripture
are significant: the cloudie pillar signified the obscure knowledge of Christ
under the Law, the pillar of fire the brighter knowledge of him in the Gospel;
the renting of the veil at the death of our Savior the opening of the way to
the Sanctum Sanctorum, into which our high Priest Christ Jesus entered after his
death, and there appears for us; the curing of all bodily diseases by the
word of Christ, the healing of all spiritual maladies by his word preached.
Now if other miracles were significant and enunciative, how much more this of
tongues? Verily he has little sight of celestial mysteries, who cannot
discern divine eloquence in these tongues, diversity of languages in the
cleaving of them, and knowledge and zeal in the fire. As S. John Baptist was,
so all the dispensers of Gods mysteries ought to Bernard. in verb. Christi.
Ille erat lucerna ardens, and lucens; lucere vanum est, ardere parum, lucere,
and ardere perfectum.
be, burning and shining lamps; shining in knowledge, burning in zeal.

There are three reasons assigned by learned Commentators, why the Spirit
manifested himself in the likeness of fiery tongues.

1. To show his affinity with the Word, such as is between fire and light: the
Word is the true light, that enlighteneth every one that comes into the
world; and here the Spirit descended in the likeness of fire.

2. To show that as by the tongue we taste all corporal meats, drinks, and
medicinal potions: so by the Spirit we have a taste of all spiritual things.

3. To teach us that as by the tongue we speak, so by the Spirit we are
enabled to utter magnalia Dei, the wonderful works of God, and the mysteries
of his kingdom: It is not ye that Matt. 10.20.
speak (says our Savior) but the Spirit which speaks in you, which Spirit
spoke by the month of the Prophets that have been since the world began. Our
mouths and tongues are but like organ-pipes, the breath which makes them
sound out Gods praises is the Spirit. And those that have their spiritual
senses exercised, can distinguish between the sound of the golden bells of
Aaron, and of the tinckling 1 Cor. 13.1.
Cymball S. Paul speaks of: for sacred eloquence consists not in the
enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power.
The fire by which these tongues were enlightened was not earthly, but heavenly,
and therefore it is said,

As of fire. Christ three several times powered out his spirit upon his
Apostles; first, Verse. 1.16.
Matthew the tenth, at their election and first mission: the second is Verse. 22.
John the twentieth, when he breathed on them, and said, Receive ye the holy
Ghost: and thirdly, in this place. At the first they received the spirit of
wisdom and knowledge: at the second, the spirit of power and authority: at the
third, the spirit of zeal and courage.

As many proprieties as the natural Philosophers observe in fire, so many
virtues the Divines will have us note in the Spirit given to the faithful:
they are specially eight; Illuminandi, of enlightening: 2. Inflammandi, of
heating: 3. Purgandi, of purifying: 4. Absumendi, of consuming: 5.
Liquefaciendi, of melting: 6. Penetrandi, of piercing: 7. Elevandi, of lifting
up, or causing to ascend: 8. Convertendi, of turning. For darkness is
dispelled, cold expelled, hardness mollified, metal purified, combustible
matter consumed, the pores of solid bodies penetrated, smoke raised up, and
all fuel turned into flame or coal by fire.

1. Of enlightening, this Leo applies to the Spirit: 2. Of enflaming, this
Gregory works upon: 3. Of purifying, this Nazianzen notes: 4. Of consuming,
this Chrysostom reckons upon: 5. Of melting, this Calvin builds upon: 6. Of
penetrating, this S. Paul 1 Cor. 2.10. The Spirit searches all things.
points to: 7. Of elevating, this Dionysius touches upon: 8. Of converting,
and this Origin and many of our later writers run upon. 1. Fire enlighteneth
the air, the Spirit the heart: 2. Fire heateth the body, the Spirit the soul:
3. Fire purges out dross, the Spirit our sins: 4. Fire consumes the
stubble, the Spirit our lusts: 5. Fire melts metals, the Spirit the hardest
heart: 6. Fire pierces into the bones, the Spirit into the inmost thoughts: 7.
Fire elevateth water and fumes, the Spirit carries up our meditations with our
penitent tears also to heaven. 8. Fire turns all things into its own
nature, the Spirit converteth all sorts of men, and of carnal makes them
spiritual.

These operations of the Spirit, God grant we may feel in our souls, so
shall we be worthy partakers of Christ his body, and by him be sanctified in
body and soul here, and glorified in both hereafter. To whom, etc.

CHRIST HIS LASTING MONUMENT, A Sermon preached on Maundy Thursday, THE LXVI.
SERMON.
1 CORINTHIANS. 11.26. As often as ye eat of this bread, and drink of this cup,
ye do show the Lords death till he come.


WHen our Savior was lifted up from the earth to draw all to him, and his
arms were stretched out at full length to compass in and embrace all true
believers: after he had bowed his head, as it were to take leave of the world,
and so given up the ghost, a soldier with a John 19.34.
spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out water and blood. Which
was done to fulfill two prophecies, the one of Exodus 12.46.
Moses, A bone of him shall not be broken; the other of Zech. 12.10.
Zechary, They shall look on him whom they pierced: as also to institute two

Sacraments, the one in the water, the other in the blood that ran from him;
the one to wash away the filth of original sin, the other to purge the guilt
of all actual: The hole in Christ's side is the source and spring of both these
Wells of salvation in the Church, which are continually filled with that which
then issued out of our Lords side. For albeit he dyed but once actu, yet he
dies continually virtute: and although his blood was shed but once really on
the cross, yet it is shed figuratively and mystically both at the font, and at
the Lords board, when the dispenser of the sacred mysteries powers water on
the child, or wine into the chalice, and by consecrating the bread apart from
the wine, severeth the blood of Christ from his body. In relation to which
lively representation of his sufferings the Apostle affirms, that as often as
we eat of that bread, and drink of that cup, we show the Lords death till he
come.

In the Tabernacle there was sanctum, and sanctum sanctorum, a holy place, and
a place most holy; so in the Church Calendar there is a holy time, all the time
of Lent, and the most holy this week, wherein our blessed Savior made six
steps to the Cross, and having in six days accomplished the works of man's
redemption, as his Father in the like number of days had finished the works
of creation, the seventh day kept his Bernard. in dic Pasch. Feria sexta
redemit hominem, ipso die, quo fecerat, sequenti die sabbatizavit in monumento.
Sabbaths rest in the grave. Now above all the days of this holiest week,
this has one privilege, that in it Christ made his last will and testament,
and instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist, and administered it in his own
person, delivering both the consecrated bread and cup of blessing to his
Apostles with his own hand. Which mysterious actions of his were presidents in
all succeeding ages, and rules for the administration of that sacrament to the
worlds end. For, Primum in unoquoque genere mensura est reliquorum, the first
action in any sacred or civil institution in respect of those that succeed, is
like the original to all after- draughts, and the copy to all that write by
it. Such was the first institution of marriage in Paradise, of circumcision in
Abraham's family, of the passover in Egypt, of all the other types and figures
of the Law on Mount Sinai, and of the Lords Supper in this upper room; wherein
all Christ's speeches and actions may not unfitly be termed Rubricks, to direct
the Christian Church in these mysterious rites. For before the end of the next
day they were all colored in blood. What was done now in effigy, was then
done in persona: he that now took bread, was taken himself: he that brake it,
was broken on the cross: he that gave it to his Disciples, was given up for
our sins: he who took the cup, received from his Father a cup of trembling:
he who powered out the wine, shed his own blood; in memory of which real
effusion thereof unto death, we celebrate this sacramental effusion unto life.
For so he commanded us, saying, Luke 22.19.
Do this in remembrance of me: and his faithful Apostle fully declares his
meaning in the words of my Text, As often, etc. As Christ 1 John 5 6.
came to us not by water only, but by water and blood; so we must come to him
not by water only, the water of regeneration in baptism, but also by the blood
of redemption, which is drunk by us in this sacrament, in obedience to his
commandment, and in acknowledgement of his love to us even to death, and in
death it self. As a Hieron. in hunc locum. Quem^dmodum si quis peregre
proficis^^ns aliquid pignoris ei quem diligit derelinquit, ut quoti^scunque
illud vid ^t, possit ejus beneficia and amicitias memorare, quod ille si
perf^cte dilexit, non potest sine ingente desid^rio videre vel ^etu.
man taking a long journie, leaves a pledge with his friend, that whenever
he looks upon it, he should think upon him in his absence; so Christ being
to depart out of this world, left these sacred elements of bread and wine with
his Church, to the end that as often as she sees them, she should think of
him and his sufferings for her. When Aeneas plucked a twigge of the tree under
which Polydorus was buried, the bough dropped blood: V^rg Aen 3.
-- cruor de stipite manat. so as soon as we pluck but a twigge of the tree
of Christ's cross, it will bleed a fresh in our thoughts, showing us to be
guilty of the death of the Lord of life. For though we never consulted with the
chief Priests, nor drove the bargain with Judas, nor pronounced sentence
against him with Pilate, nor touched his hand or foot with a nail: yet since
he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities, and the
Esa. 53.5, 6.
chastisement of our peace was upon him, and the Lord laid on him the sins of
us all, we cannot plead not guilty, inasmuch as our sins were the causes of
all his sufferings. The Passover by the Law was to be eaten with sour herbs:
and in like manner the Christian passover, which we are now met to eat, must
be eaten with sour herbs, that is, pensive thoughts, and a sad remembrance
both of our sinful actions, and our Saviors bloody passion. For as often as ye
eat, etc.

The coherence, or rather consequence of this verse to the former, is like to
that of the Echo to the voice: the words of institution rehearsed in the
former verses are as the voice, the inference of the Apostle in this verse as
the Echo. For as the Echo sounds out the last words of the voice, so the
Apostle here repeateth the last words of Christ's institution, Do this in
remembrance of me: and in effect explaineth them, saying, to do it in
remembrance of Christ, that is, as often as ye do it, ye show forth his death.

1. We are but once born, and therefore but once receive the sacrament of
Baptism, which is the seal of our regeneration; but we feed often, and
consequently are often to receive the sacrament, which is the seal of our
spiritual nourishment and growth in Christ: and therefore the Apostle says, As
often as.

2. Whenever we communicate we must make an entire meal and refection
thereof: therefore he adds, Ye eat and drink.

3. In making this spiritual refection, we must think upon Christ his bloody
passion, and declare it to others: therefore he adds, Ye show the Lords
death.

4. This commemoration of his death must continue till he has fully revenged
his death, and abolished death it self in all his mystical members: therefore
he adds, Till he come.

As often as ye are bid to the Lords Table, and come prepared, eat of this
bread; and as often as ye eat of this bread, drink of this cup: and when ye
eat and drink, show forth the Lords death; and let this annuntiation continue
till he come. If ye take away this band of connection, the parts falling asunder
will be these: 1. The time when. 2. The manner how. 3. The end why. 4. The
term how long we are to celebrate this supper.
1. The time frequent, As often. 2. The manner entire, Eat and drink. 3. The
end demonstrative, Show forth. 4. The term perpetual, Till he come, that is,
to the end of the world.


As often. We never read of any (says Praef. institut. Nusquam legimus
reprehensos qui nimium de font aquae vitae hauserint.
Calvin) that were blamed for drawing too much water out of the Wells of
salvation: neither do we find ever any taxed for too often, but for too
seldom communicating; which is utterly a fault among many at this day, who are
bid (shall I say) thrice, nay twelve times, every month once, before they come
to the Lords Table; and then they come (it is to be feared) more out of fear
of the Law, than love of the Gospel. Surely as when the appetite of the stomach
to wholesome meat fails, as in the disease called (...), the body pines, and
there is a sensible decay in all parts; so it falls out in the spiritual
(...), when the soul has no appetite to this bread of life, and food of
Angels, the inward man pineth away, and all the graces of the spirit sensibly
decay in us. This malady the Apostle suspected not to be in his Corinthians:
and therefore he imposes not here a law of often receiving, but supposes they
did so: for he imagined not that any would be so careless of their life and
safety, as not often to exemplify the copy of their pardon. He conceived that
he needed not to bid any to drink freely of the wine that makes glad the heart
of every communicant, or to eat frequently of the food that perishes not:
therefore taking that for granted, he prescribes the manner how, and the end
why they were often to celebrate this sacrament, saying, As often

As ye eat. There are three kinds of eating: 1. Spiritually only. 2.
Sacramentally only. 3. Sacramentally and spiritually.


1. They eat Christ spiritually only who believe the incarnation and passion
of our Lord and Savior, yet dye before they are called to his Table.

2. They eat sacramentally only, who are bid to the marriage feast, and come
thither also and eat of the Brides cake, and drink of her wine, but have not
on the wedding garment: such were the Jews, who ate manna in the John 6.49.
wilderness, and dyed in their sins: and Judas at Christ's last supper, and all
infidels and hypocrites, who receive at the Sacrament panem Domini, not panem
Dominum, the Lords bread, but not the Lord himself, who is that bread of John
6.48.
life.

3. They eat Christ both sacramentally and spiritually, who believing in
Christ's incarnation and passion, according to his command, come with
preparation unto this Table, and with their mouth feed upon the outward
element: which may be considered three ways, 1. In substance, so it is bread,
or wine. 2. In use, so it is a sacrament. 3. In significancy and efficacy to
all believers, so it is the body and blood of Christ.


And drink. It is worth your observation, that our adversaries the Papists,
who are so much against a figure in the words used in the consecration of the
bread, This is my body, yet are forced to admit of a double figure in the words
used in the consecration of the cup, This is the new Testament in my blood. If
they cast not here a double figure, they are lost: for first, there is
continens pro contento, the cup put for the liquor contained in it. Secondly,
in those words, as likewise in the words of my Text, they must digest a
Metonymie, or swallow down flagons and cups.

This cup. The sacrament is called a cup in a double respect: 1. Quia potus,
drink to nourish and refresh the soul. 2. Quia potio, because a medicinal
potion to purge the conscience.


In ep. ad Cor. 1. c. 11. Materialis, qui debet sumi parce, dari large:
sacramentalis, qui debet sumi innocenter, tractari reverenter: spiritualis,
scilicet passionis vel poenitentiae, qui debet sumi libenter, sustineri
laetanter: vituperabilis, qui debet estundi simpliciter.
Gorrhan finds out four sorts of cups, and engraveth upon each of them a
several poesy.

1. The material or ordinary cup, which (says he) ought to be taken
sparingly, but given liberally.

2. The sacramental, which ought to be taken innocently, and touched
reverently.

3. The spiritual, which ought to be taken willingly, and borne joyfully.

4. The abominable and execrable cup, which ought to be refused absolutely, or
shed wholly.

But although this fourth cup be mentioned ( Apoc. 17.4.) yet we will content
our selves at this time with these three cups: 1. Calix consolationis, the cup
of mirth and spiritual consolation. 2. Calix afflictionis, the cup of
affliction. 3. Calix benedictionis, the cup of blessing. Of the first Psalm.
23.5.
David drank freely. Of the second Jer. 16.7. Lam. 4.21. Ezekiel. 23.33.
Jeremy sorrowfully. Of the third the 1 Cor. 10.6.
Corinthians holily.

If this cup in my text be calix benedictionis, the cup of blessing, then
certainly the Romish Priests deserve calicem maledictionis, a cup of cursing,
who deprive the laity of this cup. They cannot say in their congregation to the
people, As often as ye drink of this cup; for they never drink of it. To whom
belongs the commandment of eating, Take, eat? to the Priests only? Why
then do the Laity among them eat? To the Laity also? Why then do they not
drink, since it is most evident in the text that Christ said, Mat 26.27.
Drink ye all of this, to whom before he gave the bread, saying, Take, eat?
Mat. 19.6.
Those things which God has joined together let no man put asunder. If the cup
were not needful, why did Christ add it to his Supper? If it were needful,
why do they take it away? Doubtless as half a meal is no meal, nor half a
hand a hand, nor half a ship a ship; so neither is their half communion a
Sacrament: si dividis perdis. This is the cup of the New Testament, says
Christ, which is shed for Mat. 26.28.
many for the remission of sins. Are these many only Priests? Had the Laity
no sins, or no remission of sins by Christ's blood? If they have, as they
all profess, why do they forbid them that which Christ expressly commands
them? Drink ye all of this, for it is shed for you, and for many. But to go no
farther than this chapter: when St. Paul requires, ver. 28. Let a man examine
himself, I would willingly examine our Adversaries, whether this precept
concerns the lay people or no? They will say it does especially, because they
most need examination, that they may confess their sins, and receive
absolution for them, before they presume to come to the Lords Table: let them
then read what follows in the same verse, and so let them eat of that bread
and drink of that cup.

Ye do show the Lords death. The Apostle does not hereby exclude other ends of
receiving the Sacrament, but shows this to be the chiefest. God never set so
many remarkable accidents upon any thing as on his Sons death, at which the
Sun was eclipsed, the rocks were cloven, the veil of the Temple rent from the
top to the bottom, the graves opened, and the dead arose. Precious in the
sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints, but most precious the death of
his holy One: for this Sacrament was principally instituted to keep in
remembrance that his precious death. We show forth Christ's death three manner
of ways; 1 In verbo. 2 In signo. 3 In opere.
1 By commemoration of the history of his passion. 2 By representation thereof
in the sacred Symboles. 3 By expression thereof in our death to sin.
And as it is more to show forth Christ's death in signo, by administering or
participating the Sacrament thereof, than in verbo, by discoursing of his
passion: so it is much more to show it forth in opere, in mortifying our
members upon earth, and crucifying the lusts of the flesh, than in verbo or
signo. After these three ways we must all show forth the Lords death

Till he come. To wit, either to each particular man at the hour of his death,
or to all men and the whole Church on earth at the day of judgment. This
Sacrament is called by the ancient Fathers viaticum morientium, the dying man's
provision for the long journey he is to take. Every faithful Christian
therefore is to communicate as long as he is able, and can worthily prepare
himself, even to the day of his dissolution; and all congregations professing
the Christian religion, must continue the celebration of this holy Sacrament
till the day of the worlds consummation.

As often. The seldomer we come to the table of some men the welcomer we are:
but on the contrary, we are the better welcome the oftener we come to the
Lords Table with due preparation. There are two reasons especially why we
ought often to eat of this bread, and drink of this cup; the first is drawn
from God and his glory: the second from our selves and our benefit. The oftener
we partake of these holy mysteries, being qualified thereunto, the more we
illustrate Gods glory, and confirm our faith. If any demand further how often ye
ought to communicate, I answer

1. In general, as often as ye need it, and are fit for it. The Cypr. ep. 54.
Quomodo provocamus eos in confessione nominis Christi sanguinem suum fundere,
si iis militaturis Christi sanguinem denegamus? aut quomodo ad Martyrii poculum
idoneos facimus, si non eos prius ad bibendum in Ecclesia poculum jure
communicationis admittimus?
Martyrs in the Primitive Church received every day, because looking every
hour to be called to sign the truth of their religion with their blood, they
held it needful by communicating to arm themselves against the fear of
death. Others in the time of peace received either daily, or at least every
Lords day. The former Saint Austine neither likes nor disliketh, the latter he
exhorts all unto.

2. I answer in particular out of Fabianus, the Synod of Agatha, and the
Rubric of our Communion book, that every one at least ought to communicate
thrice a year, at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsontide: howbeit we are not so
much to regard the season of the year, as the disposition of our mind in going
forward, or drawing back from this holy Table. The sacrament is fit for us at
all times, but we are not fit for it: Gratian. de consecrat. distinct. 2.
Quotidie Eucharistiam dominicam accipere, nec laudo, nec vitupero; omnibus
tamen dominicis communicandum hortor Ibid. Qui in natali Domini Paschate and
Pentecoste non communicaverint, catholici non credantur, nec inter catholicos
habeantur.
wherefore let every man examine his own conscience, how he stands in
favor with God, and peace with men: how it is with him in his spiritual
estate, whether he grows or decays in grace: whether the Flesh get the hand
of the Spirit, or the Spirt of the Flesh; whether our ghostly strength against
all temptations be increased or diminished; and accordingly (as the Spirit of
God shall incline our hearts) let us either out of sense of our own
unworthiness, and reverence to this most holy ordinance forbear, or with due
preparation and renewed faith and repentance approach to this Table, either to
receive a supply of those graces we want, or an increase of those we have; and
when we come, let us

Eat of this bread, and drink of this cup. For as both eyes are requisite to
the perfection of sight, so both Elements to the perfection of the Sacrament.
This the Schools roundly confess: Two things (says Part. 3. q. 63. art. 1.
Ideo ad Sacramenti hujus integritatem duo concurrunt, scilicet, spiritualis
cibus and potus. Et q. 80. art. 12. Ex part ipsius Sacramenti convenit, quod
utrumque sumatur, corpus scilicet and sanguis, quia in utroque consistit
perfectio Sacramenti.
Aquinas) concur to the integrity of the Sacrament, viz. spiritual meat and
drink: and again, It is requisite in regard of the Sacrament that we receive
both kinds, the body and the blood, because in both consists the perfection
of the Sacrament. And Bonavent. in 4. sent. did. 11. part. 2. art. 1. Perfecta
refectio non est in part tantum, sed in utroque: ideo non in uno tantum
perfect signatur Christus ut reficiens, sed in utroque.
Bonaventure, A perfect refection or repast is not in bread only, but in bread
and drink: therefore Christ is not perfectly signified as feeding our souls
in one kind, but in both. And Soto in 12. distinct. q. 1. art. 12. Sacramentum
non nisi in utraque specie, quantum ad integram signification em perficitur.
Soto, The Sacrament, as concerning the entire signification thereof, is not
perfect but in both kinds. Doubtless, if the Sacrament be a banquet or a
supper, there must be drink in it as well as meat. The Popish communion, be
it what it may be, to the Laity cannot be a supper in which the Laity sup
nothing; neither can they fulfill the precept of the Apostle of showing forth
the Lords death: for the effusion of the wine represents the shedding of
Christ's blood out of the veins, and the parting of his soul from his body. If
we should grant unto our adversaries, which they can never evict, that the
blood of Christ might be received in the bread, yet by such receiving Christ's
death by the effusion of his blood for us, could in no wise be represented or
shown forth; which the Apostle here teaches to be the principal end of
receiving this Sacrament: As often, says he, as ye eat of this bread and
drink of this cup

Ye show forth Christ's death. In Christ's death all Christianity is briefly
summed: for in it we may observe the justice of God satisfied, the love of
Christ manifested, the power of Satan vanquished, the liberty of man from the
slavery of sin and death purchased, all figures of the Old Testament
verified, all promises of the New ratified, all prophecies fulfilled, all debts
discharged, all things requisite for the redemption of mankind, and to the
worlds restoration accomplished. Therein we have a pattern of obedience to the
last breath, of humility descending as low as hell, of meekness putting up
insufferable wrongs, of patience enduring merciless torments; compassion
weeping and praying for bloody persecuters; constancy holding out to the end:
to which virtues of his person, if ye lay the benefits of his passion
redounding to his Church, which he has comforted by his agony, quit by his
taking, justified by his condemnation, healed by his stripes, cleansed by his
blood, quickened by his death, and crowned by his cross; if you take a full
sight of all the virtues wherewith his cross is beset as with so many jewels,
I make no doubt but that you will resolve with the Apostle, to desire to know
nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified. Let Israel hope in the Lord (says
the Psalm. 130 7.
Psalmist) for with the Lord there is mecrcy, and with him is plenteous
redemption. Plenteous, for what store of blood shed he in his agony, in his
crowning with thorns, in his whipping, in his nailing, and lastly in the
piercing of his side! whereas one drop of his blood, in regard of the infinite
dignity of his person, might have served for the ransom of many worlds: one
drop of his blood was more worth than all the precious things in the world. As
Pliny writes of the herb Plin. l. 22. c. 15. Scorpius herba v^let adversus
animal sui nominis.
Scorpius, that it is a remedy against the poison of a Scorpion; so Christ's
death and cross is a sovereign remedy against all manner of deaths and
crosses. For all such crosses make a true believer conformable to his Redeemers
image, and every conformity to him is a perfection, and every such perfection
shall add a jewel to his crown of glory. This death of Christ so precious, so
sovereign, we show forth in shadow as it were and adumbration, when either we
discourse of the history of Christ's passion, or administer the Sacrament of his
death; but to the life, when as Saint Francis is said to have had the print of
Christ's five wounds on his body, so we have the print of them in our souls:
when we express his death in our mortification, when we tie our selves to our
good behavior, and restrain our desires and affections, as he was nailed to
the cross: when we thirst after righteousness, as he thirsted on the cross
for our salvation: when we are pierced with godly sorrow, as his soul was
heavy unto death; and when as his flesh, so our carnal lusts are crucified:
when as he commended his soul to his Father, so we in our greatest
extremities commit our souls to God, as our faithful Creator. Cui, etc.

THE SIGN AT THE HEART. A Sermon preached on the first Sunday in Lent. THE
LXVII. SERMON.
ACTS 2.37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles; Men and brethren, What shall we
do?


Sins for repentance to work upon, and repentance for sin, take up in a
manner our whole life. Not only the wicked (in their endless mazes) in the
rode to hell, but even the godly, who endeavor to make the streightest steps
they can to heaven, Ambulant in circuitu, walk in a kind of circuit. From
fasting to feasting, and from feasting again to fasting; from Mount Gerizin to
Mount Hebal, and from Mount Hebal to Mount Gerizin; from sins to repentance,
and from repentance back again, though against their will, to sin. It is
true, that grace in the regenerate never quits the field, but grows more and
more upon corrupt nature, and in the end conquereth her: yet so conquereth her
(as Lucullus and other Roman Captains did Cic. de leg. Manil. Ita tamen
superarunt, ut ille pulsus superatusque regnaret.
Mithridates) that nature still rules in the members, and often puts the
mind to the worst, always to much trouble. Wherefore as the Sea-mew that makes
her nest on the sea shore, is forced daily to repair it, because every day the
violent assault of the sea waves moulter away some part thereof; so the
regenerate and sanctified soul has need to renew the inward man daily, and
repair the conscience by repentance, because every day, nay almost every
hour, by the violent assaults of tentation and sins, as they are termed, of
ordinary incursion, some breach or other is made into it.

Now albeit private repentance has no day set, nor time prefixed to it, but is
always in season: yet now is the peculiar season of public, when the practice
of the primitive, and the sanction of the present Church calls us to watching
and fasting, to weeping and mourning, to sackcloth and ashes, to humiliation
and contrition; when in a manner the whole Christian world (I except only some
few Heteroclites) accords with us in our groans, and consorteth with our
sighs, and keeps stroke with us in the beating our breasts, and sets
open the sluices to make a flood of tears, and carry away the filth of the
whole year past. Abyssus abyssum invocet, let this flood carry away the former
deluge. Verily such is the overflowing of iniquity, and inundation of impurity
in this last and worst age of the world, that the most righteous among us can
hardly keep up their head, and hold out their hands above water, to call to God
for mercy for themselves and others: has not then the Church of God great
reason to oppose the Eves, Embers, and Lent fasts, as so many floud-gates, if
not quite to stay, yet somewhat to stop the current of sin? Anselme, sometimes
Archbishop of Canterbury, whom the Church of Rome has inserted into the Canon
of Saints, (but he ranketh himself among the Apocrypha of sinners) recounting
with hearts grief and sorrow the whole course of his life, and finding the
infancy of sin in the sins of his infancy, the youth and growth of sin in
the sins of his youth, and the maturity and ripeness of all sin in the
sins of his ripe and perfect age, breaks forth into this passionate speech,
Quid restat tibi, O peccator, nisi ut tota vita deploret totam vitam? What
remains for thee, wretched man, but that thou spend the remainder of thy whole
life in bewailing thy whole life? What should we (Beloved) in a manner do
else, considering that even when we pray against sin, we sin in praying: when
we have made holy vows against sin, our vows by the breach of them turn into
sin: after we have repented of our sins, we repent of our repentance, and
thereby increase our sin? In which consideration, if all the time that is
given us should be a Hier. ep. 7. In quadragesima abstinentiae vela pandenda
sunt and tota aurigae retinacula laxanda.
Lent of discipline, if all weeks Embers, if all days of the week
Ashwednesdayes, how much more ought we to keep Lent in Lent now, at least
continually to call upon the name of God for our continual blaspheming it? Now
to fast for our sins in feasting, now to weep and mourn for our sins in
laughing, sporting, and rioting in sinful pleasures: to this end our tender
mother the Spouse of Christ debarreth us of all other delights, that we should
make Gods statutes our delights: for this cause she subtracteth our bodily
refection, that we may feast our souls: therefore she takes away or
diminishes our portion in the comforts of this life, that with holy David we
should take God for our Psalm. 119.57.
portion. This is a time, as the name imports, Lent of God to examine our
accounts, and clear them: a holy tenth of the year to be offered to him: the
sacred Eve and Vigils to the great feast of our Chris^^an passover. Your
humbling your bodies by watching and fasting, your sou^es by weeping and
mourning, your rending your hearts with sighs, the resolving your eyes into
tears, your continual prostration before the throne of grace, and offering up
prayers with strong cries, are at this time not only kind fruits of your
devotion, special exercises of your mortification, necessary parts of
contrition, but also testimonies of obedience to the Law, and duties of
conformity to Christ's sufferings, and of preparation to our most public and
solemn Communions at Easter.

To prick you on forward in this most necessary duty, of pricking your
hearts with godly sorrow for your sins, I have made choice of this verse,
wherein the Evangelist S. Luke relates the effects of S. Peter's Sermon in all
his auditors. 1. Inward impression, they were pricked in heart. 2. Outward
expression, men and brethren, what shall we do?


What Eupolis sometimes spoke of Pericles, that after his oration made to the
people of Athens, Cic. de clar. orat. In animis auditorum aculeos reliquit.
he left certain needles and stings in their minds, may be more truly
affirmed of this Sermon of the Apostle, which when the Jews heard they were
pricked at heart, and not able to endure the pain, cry out men and brethren,
what shall we do? The ancient painters, to set forth the power of eloquence,
drew Bodin. l. 4. de rep. c. 7. Majores Herculem Celticum senem effingebant, ex
cujus ore catenarum maxima vis ad aures infinitae multitudinis perveniret, etc.
Hercules Celticus with an infinite number of chains coming out of his mouth,
and reaching to the ears of great multitudes: much after which manner S. Luke
describes S. Peter in my text, with his words, as it were so many golden
chains, fastened first upon the ears, and after upon the hearts of three
thousand, and drawing them up at once in the drag-net of the Gospel. Now our
blessed Savior made good his promise to him, (...), thou shall catch live men;
and this access of souls to the Church, and happy success in his
ministerial function, seems to have been fore-shewed to him by that great
draught of fish taken after Christ's resurrection, the draught was an John 21.11.
hundred fifty and three great fishes; and for all there were so many, yet,
says the text, the net was not broken. The truth always exceeds the type,
for here were three thousand great and small taken, and yet the net was not
broken; there was no schism nor rupture thereby: for all the converts were of
one mind, they were all affected with the same malady, they feel the same
pain at the heart, and seek for ease and help at the hands of the same
Physicians, Peter and the rest of the Apostles, saying, Men and brethren, what
shall we do?

Now when they heard these things they were pricked. Why, what touched them so
near? no doubt those words, Ver. 23, 24.
Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye
have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain, whom God has raised
up, having loosened the pains of death, because it was not possible that he
should be holden of it. This could not but touch the quickest veins in their
heart, that they should be the death of the Lord of life, that they should slay
their Messiah, that they should destroy the Savior of the world. Of all sins
murder cries the loudest in the ears of God and men; of all murders, the
murder of an only begotten son most enrageth a loving father, and
extimulateth him unto revenge: in what woeful case then might they well suppose
themselves to be, who after S. Peter had opened their eyes, saw that their
hands (...) been deep in the blood of the Son of God? Now their blasphemous
words which they spoke against him, are sharp swords wounding deeply their
souls; the thorns wherewith they pricked his head, and the nails wherewith
they pierced his hands and feet, pricked and pierced their very heart.

They were pricked in heart: That is, they were pierced tho row with sorrow,
they took on most grievously. Here lest we mistake phrases of like sound,
though not of like sense, we must distinguish of spiritus compunctionis, and
compunctio spiritus, (...), and (...), Romans 11.8.
a spirit of compunction reproved in the unbeleeving Jews, and compunction of
spirit, or of the heart, here noted by S. Luke: the former phrase signifies
slumber, stupiditie, or obstinacy in sin, this latter hearty sorrow for it:
the former is a malady for the most part incurable, the latter is the cure of
all our spiritual maladies. Now godly sorrow is termed compunction of the
heart for three reasons, as Lorin. in Act. c. 2. Dicitur dolor de peccato
admisso, quod est compunctio, vel quia aperitur cordis apostema, vel quia
vulneratur cor amore Dei, vel quia demon dolor and invidia sauciatur.
Lorinus conceives.

1. Because thereby the corruption of the heart is discovered, as an aposteme
is opened by the prick of a sharp instrument. 2. Because thereby, like the
Spouse in the Canticles, we become sick of love, as the least prick at the
heart causes a present fit of sickness. 3. Because thereby the Devil is, as
it were, wounded with indignation and envy. When they heard these things they
were pricked in heart: when they were pricked in heart
They said. As the strokes in music answer the notes that are pricked in the
rules: so the words of the mouth answer Cic. 3. de Ora. Totum corpus hominis,
and omnes ejus vultus, omnesque voces, ut nervi infidibus ita sonant, and a
motu quoque animi sint pulsae.
to the motions and affections of the heart. The Anatomists teach, that the
heart and tongue hang upon one string. And hence it is, that as in a clock or
watch, when the first wheel is moved the hammer strikes: so when the heart is
moved with any passion or perturbation, the hammer beats upon the bell, and the
mouth sounds: as we heard from David, Psalm. 45.1.
My heart is enditing a good matter, and my tongue is the pen of a ready
writer. And from S. Paul: Romans 10.10.
With the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the tongue
confession is made unto salvation. And from our Savior: Luke 6.45.
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things,
and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil
things; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. Many among us
complain that they are tongue-tied, that when they are at their private
devotions, their words stick in their mouths, and they cannot freely power out
their souls into the bosom of their Redeemer; but they look not into the
cause of it, they have not got a stock of heavenly knowledge, and sanctified
forms of words, their hearts are not filled with the holy spirit: for were
they full, they would easily vent themselves. They cannot freely bring forth,
because they have laid up nothing in the treasury of their hearts.

To Peter and the rest of the Apostles. As those that were wounded with the
darts of Achilles, could no otherwise be cured than by his salves and
plasters: so the Jews who were wounded by S. Peter's sharp reprehension, could
be by no other means cured, than by his own salves and receipts which he
prescribes afterward. Here our Lorin. comment. in Act. c. 2. Alias notatum
est quoties Petri cum aliis Apostolis mentio fit, Petrum primo loco poni
tanquam ducem, ideoque nunc Judaei omnes ad illum se convertunt. and in c. 1.
v. 13. Facit ad Petri primatum non mediocriter, quod tum Lucas in isto capite,
sicut in Evangelio, texens Apostolorum catalogum, ut etiam Matthaeus and
Marcus, primum ante omnes nominant.
adversaries, who will not let the least tittle fall to the ground that may
serve any way to advance the title and dignity of the Bishop of Rome, will have
us take special notice, that here and elsewhere Peter is named before the rest
of the Apostles: and that ye may know that all is fish that comes to Peter's
net, Bellarmine will tell you that the Popes monarchy is proclaimed in those
words in the Acts, Rise up Peter, kill and eat, (Acts 11.7.) I know not with
what perspective the Cardinal reads the Scriptures; but sure I am he sees
more in this vision, than any of the ancient or later Commentators ever
discerned; yet Baronius sees more than he: Those were healed (says he) who
came but within the shadow of Peter. Acts 5.15. They brought forth the sick
into the streets, and laid them on beds or couches, that at the least the
shadow of Peter passing by, might over-shadow them. The same virtue is given to
the shadow of Peter, which is given to his body, that we might know that such
store of grace was given to Peter, that God would have the same gifts derived
to his successors, who represent his person. Thus as ye see, the Papists as
men in danger of drowning, catch at every rotten stake to support their faith
in the Popes supremacy. Lorinus catches at the placing of a word, Bellarmine
at a mystical apparition, and Baron. ad an. 34. p. 303. Eadem virtus umbrae
corporis Petri tradita, quae and corpori, ut cognoscamus tantam gratiaru^
copia^ Petro collatam, ut eadem dona in successoribus, qui referunt personam
Petri, propagari Deus voluerit.
Baronius at a shadow. What serves this shadow to illustrate or confirm the
Popes or Peter's supremacy? It pleased God, for the manifestation of his power,
and the performance of Christ's promise to his disciples, that they in his name
should work greater miracles than some of those that he had done, to heal the
sick by Paul's handkerchiefes, and Peter's shadow: Ergo, Peter was chief of all
the Apostles, and the Pope the Monarch of the visible Church. Neither is there
any clearer evidence in that vision which S. Peter saw of a sheet let down
from heaven, in which there were foure-footed beasts of the earth, and wild
beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And he heard a voice
saying unto him; Arise Peter, slay and eat. At manducare est capitis, says the
Cardinal: but it is the head that eats, the Pope therefore is the head. He
should better have concluded, the Popes are the teeth: for S. Peter himself
made no other interpretation of this vision, than that the Gentiles, whose
hearts God had purified by faith, were not to be accounted unclean; and
therefore he alleges this apparition in his apology for going unto the
uncircumcised, and eating with them. As little makes the setting of Peter's
name before the rest, for his authority over them. For here was a special
reason why the Jews directed their speech to Peter in the first place: because
it was he who charged them so deep, he put them in this perplexity; and
therefore to him they addressed themselves for counsel and comfort. Elsewhere,
where there is not the like occasion, others are named before him, as Gal. 2.9.
James, Cephas, and John, who seemed pillars.
James, and Mark 16.7. Tell the disciples and Peter.
Andrew, and the John 4.2. the city of Andrew and Peter.
Disciples. Here I demand of Lorinus, does the naming of Andrew before Peter,
or of James, or the Disciples, prove that any of these were superiors to
Peter? If they were, what becomes of Peter's supremacy? If they were not, what
makes the naming him before them for it? Without all question, if the setting
of Peter after the rest of the Apostles and Disciples in the texts above
alleged, makes not against; the setting him here before them, makes not for
his supremacy.

Men and brethren what shall we do? Seneca says, Levis dolor est qui
consilium capit, It is a light grief which admits of consultation: but we
may say more truly, Sanus dolor est qui consilium capit; It is an healthful
malady and an happy grief, which drives us to our spiritual Physician, and
exciteth us to a careful use of the means of salvation. S. 2 Cor. 7.9, 11.
Paul rejoiced at this symptom in his patients at Corinth: Now I rejoice not
that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for behold this
self same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carfulness it
wrought in you, etc.

What shall we do to satisfy the Father for the death of his Son, to ease
our burdened consciences, to wash away the guilt of the effusion of innocent
blood? Behold here the effects of soule-ravishing eloquence, attention,
compunction, and a sollicitous enquiry after the means of everlasting
salvation: or if ye like better of an allegorical partition, see here, 1. The
weapon wherewith they were wounded, the Word preached, when they heard, etc. 2.
The wound, which was a prick at the heart. 3. The cure, not words but deeds,
they said, what shall we do?


Here ye have a pattern, both of a faithful teacher and religious hearers; a
faithful teacher tickleth not the ears, but pricketh the heart; his words are
not like bodkins to curle the hair, but like goads and nails that prick the
heart; though the goads go not so deep that pierce but the skin, the nails
go farther, for they are driven to the very heart of the auditors up to the
head. The religious hearer, when he is reproved for his sin, spurneth not at
the Minister of God, but receiving the words with meekness, communeth with his
own heart whether the reproof were just or no, and finding it just,
confesses his sin, and seeks for pardon and forgiveness. The Jews here
when they were charged by S. Peter with the murder of the son of God, say
not, Quid hic? sed quid nos? not what has this man to meddle with us? but who
can give us good counsel? not what shall we say? but what shall we do? for
words are too light a recompense for deeds.

1. A word of the duty of faithful teachers, that with the cock, by clapping
my wings upon my breast, I may awake my self as well as others. The salvation
of the hearers much depends upon the gifts of the Preacher, and the gifts of
the Preacher much depend upon his sincere intention, not to gain profit or
Salvianus de gubernat. Dei, lib. 1. Utilia magis quam plausibilia sectari, nec
lenocinia quaerere sed remedia.
applause to himself, but souls to God: not to tickle their ears, but to
prick their hearts. Such a Preacher Bern. in Cant. Illius doctoris vocem
libentius audio, non qui sibi plausum, sed qui mihi planctum movet.
S. Bernard ever wished to hear, at whose Sermon the people hemmed not, but
sighed; clapped not their hands as at a play, but knocked their breasts as at a
funeral. According to which pattern Hieron. Nepot. Te docente in ecclesia,
non clamor populi, sed gemitus suscipiatur; lachrymae auditorum tuae lauds
sint.
S. Jerome endeavors to frame Nepotian his scholar, When thou teach in the
Church (says he) let there be heard no shouts of admiration, but sobs of
contrition: let the fluencie of thy eloquence be seen in the cheeks of thy
hearers. This is not done by ostentation of art, but by evidence of the spirit.
A painted fire heateth not, nor do the gestures and motions of an artificial
man, destitute of soul and life, any whit move our affections: (...), they are
the graces of sanctification shining in the countenance, gesture, and life of
the Preacher (and not the beauty and ornaments of speech) which insinuate into
the heart, and multiply themselves there: without which, though we speak with
the tongues of men and Angels, we are but like sounding brass or tinckling
cymbals: except the Lord touch the heart and the tongue of the Preacher with a
coal from his Altar, all the luster of rhetorical arguments, and blaze of
words, will yield no more warmth to the conscience than a glow-worme. Ye have
heard briefly of the duty of Pastors, reserve (I pray you) one ear to listen
to your own duty as hearers.

2. It was the manner of the Jews to bore through the ears of those servants
that meant not to leave them till death: and if ye desire to be in the lists
of Gods servants, ye must have your ears bored, and the pearls of the Gospel
hanging at them. All shepherds set a mark upon their sheep; and so does the
good Shepherd that gave his life for his sheep: and this mark is in the ear,
Joh. 10.3, 27.
My sheep hear my voice. There is no doctrine in the word we hear of more
often, than of hearing the word and keeping it. We hear that we ought to hear
the Father; Esaias 1.1.
Hear O heaven, and hearken O earth, for the Lord has spoken: we hear that
we ought to hear the Son; Mat. 13.43. Mat. 17.5.
He that has ears to hear let him hear: and, This is my well-beloved Son in
whom I am well pleased, hear ye him: we hear that we ought to hear the
Spirit; Apoc. 2.7.
Let him that has an ear to hear, hear what the Spirit says to the
Churches. All the venturers in the great ship called Argonavis, bound for
Colchis to fetch the golden fleece, when they were assaulted by the Sirens,
endeavoring to enchant them with their songs, found no such help in any thing
against them, as in Orpheus his pipe: we are all venturers for a golden crown
in heaven, and as the Grecians, so we are waylaid by Sirens, evil spirits,
and their incantations, from which we cannot be safe, but by listening to the
Preachers of the Gospel, who when they pipe unto us out of the word, our hearts
dance for joy. In that golden chain of the Apostle, the first link is hung at
the ear, Faith comes by Romans 10.14, 17.
hearing, and hearing by the word of God. How shall they call on him, on whom
they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him, of whom they have
not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? Do we think that God
will hear us in our prayers, if we hear not him speaking to us in his Word?
The Prophet Zach. 7.13.
Zachary assures us he will not: When I cried they would not hear, so they
cried and I would not hear them, says the Lord of hosts. If ye desire with
S. Paul to hear in heaven, (...), the 2 Cor. 12.4.
words that cannot be uttered, ye must on earth be attentive hearers to the
words uttered by our Peter's and Paul's. None was cured with more difficulty (as
it seems) than the man that had a deaf and dumb spirit: such are our
obstinate Recusants and Seperatists, who have not an ear to hear what God
speaks to them by the Ministers of the Word. Religion is not unfitly compared
to the Weasell, Adrian. Jun. emblem. Mustella concipit aure, parit ore.
which, as Adrianus Junius writes, conceives at the ear, and brings forth
her young ones at her mouth: for the seed of Gods word is cast in at the ear,
and there having conceived divine thoughts and meditations, she brings forth
the fruit of devotion at her mouth, praises and thanksgivings, godly
admonitions, exhortations, reprehensions and consolations. Mark your Jaylers,
they often suffer their prisoners to have their hands and feet free; neither
are they in any fear that they will make an escape, so long as the prison
doors and gates are sure locked and fast barred: so deals Satan with those
whom he holds in captivity, he lets them sometimes have their hands at
liberty to reach out an alms to the poor, and sometimes their feet to go to
Church to hear prayers; but he will be sure to keep the ears, which are the
gates and doors of their soul, fast: which he locks up with these or the like
suggestions. Christ says that his house is Domus orationis, not orationum, an
house of prayer, not of sermons. Few there are but know enough, the greatest
defect is in the practice of religious duties: What can they hear which they
have not often heard before, which no sooner enters in at one ear, but
runs out at the other? Give me leave a little to lift these Adders from the
ground, whereby they stop the right ear, and pluck their tail from the head,
whereby they stop the left, that they may be charmed both by the word and by
the voice of reason it self.

Christ says his house is an house of prayer: but where spoke he this? spoke
he it not in the Temple? and were not these very words part of a sermon which
he preached to the buyers and sellers there? He has but little skill in the
language of Canaan, who knows not that prayer and invocation of Gods name, is
in Scripture by a Synecdoche taken for the whole Acts 2.21. Romans 10.13.
Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, etc.
worship of God: yet admit that our Savior should in that place take prayers
strictly, for that part of Gods worship which consists in lifting up our
hands, to prefer our petitions and supplications unto him; S. Paul furnishes
us with a direct answer to this objection, even by those questions he
propounds, Romans 10.14.
How then shall they call on him, on whom they have not beleveed? how shall
they believe on him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear
without a preacher? As there is no powerful preaching without prayer to God
for a blessing upon it: so no good prayer without preaching, to direct both in
the matter and form, and to inflame our hearts with zeal. There being three
parts of prayer, humble confession, confident invocation, and hearty
thanksgiving; how can they make a full confession of their sins, who learn
not what are sins from the mouth of the Preacher? How can they be humbled in
such sort as they ought, before whom the Preacher out of the word sets not
God his terrible name, glorious Majesty, all-seeing eye, infinite purity,
strict justice, fierce wrath against sin, together with man his vileness,
wretchedness, sinfulness, wants and infirmities? How can they call upon God
with confidence, who are not persuaded out of the Word by the Preacher, of God
his love to man, mercy and long-suffering, gracious promises, omnipotent
goodness; as also of Christ his perfect obedience, plenary satisfaction, and
perpetual intercession? How can they recount Gods blessings, both spiritual
and temporal, who never have been told them by the Preacher?

Yea but they will say they know enough of these things: nihil est dictum quod
non sit dictum prius. This very objection of theirs bewrayes their ignorance
and want of knowledge in divine things. For were they rightly instructed as
they ought to be, they could not but know that the Scripture is like a
plentiful mine, in which the deeper we dig, the vein of heavenly truths
proves still the richer; they would know that all the Saints of God in all ages
have complained of, and confessed their ignorance, and continually prayed with
David, Doce me viam statutorum tuorum, O teach me the way of thy statutes, and
open mine eyes, that I may see the wonderful things of thy law. Lastly, that
it is the duty of every good Christian to Ambros. de Offic. l. 1. Et quantumvis

meditate on those things he reads and hears, that his profiting may

grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Admit they should learn no new thing in diverse Sermons, yet will not this any
way excuse their neglect of this duty of hearing; neither ought it to be any
cause at all to keep them from Sermons: because instruction of ignorance is
not the only end of preaching, there are many others; as, to glorify God, to
countenance the ministry of his word by their presence, to encourage others
to the diligent and constant hearing of the word by their example, who perhaps
may more need instruction than themselves; to testify their obedience to Gods
ordinance, who commands all his servants, as well to hear him when he
speaks to them in his Word, as to speak unto him in their prayers; to have
religious affections stirred up in them, sometimes hope, sometimes fear,
sometimes godly sorrow, sometimes spiritual joy, always zeal for Gods
glory, fervor in their devotion, and watchfulness over all their ways: to
be put in mind of those things which indeed they knew before, but either
forgot, or made as little use of them as if they had never known them: to be
awaked out of their spiritual lethargy: to be admonished of diverse dangers
they are like to incur: to be convinced of diverse errors which they count to
be none till the powerful ministry of the Word has demonstrated them to be
such: to reprove them of the sins they daily commit, as well of ignorance as
against their conscience: and to prick their hearts deep with godly
compunction, that with weeping eyes and bleeding hearts they may seek to God in
time for pardon. Lastly, to prepare them to perform all religious duties in a
better manner, that they may for the future receive more comfort in their
private devotions, and more benefit by the public ministry of the Word and
Sacraments. The grand enemy of our souls, partly by immediate suggestions and
thoughts ingested into our minds, and partly by the mouths or pens of
Atheists, Infidels, Heretics and Schismatickes, lays new batteries against
our most holy faith: and is it not then most needful to learn from the most
able and experienced Soldiers of Christ how to beat them off, and fortify
against them? And if their memory be so brittle and pertuse, as they pretend,
that it will hold nothing, there is a greater necessity for them to hear
oftener than others, that the frequent inculcation of the same doctrine may
imprint that in their minds which others receive by the first hearing. And to
answer them in their own metaphor; albeit the bucket be so full of holes that
all the water they take up in it runs out, yet certainly the often dipping
it into the Well, and filling it with water, will make it moister than
otherwise it would have been. And so I pass from the ear mark of Christ's
sheep, to the mark in their heart.

They were pricked in heart. This prick in the heart may be considered two
manner of ways: 1 In a reference to the cause, and so it is an effect. 2 In a
reference to the subject, and so it is an affection.
If we consider it as an effect, it shows unto us the efficacy of Gods Word
in the mind of the hearers, which is far greater than any force of humane art
or eloquence. Art and humane eloquence may move affection, but it is the
powerful preaching of the Word only that can remove corruption; as we read,
Lex Jehovae convertens animas, Psalm. 19.7.
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The word of man my
tickle the ear, but it is the word of God only which pricketh deep the
heart. Hence it is compared to a goad, Eccles. 12.11.
or nail fastened by the masters of the assemblies: nay to a Heb. 4.12.
two-edged sword, piercing to the dividing asunder of soul, and spirit, and
joints, and marrow: nay to thunder, which breaks the bones, not hurting the
yielding flesh; at the sound whereof Luke 10.18.
Satan falls like lightening from heaven. This efficacy of the word of God
proves the Divinity thereof: as it could not be divine, but it must needs be
effectual; so it could not be so effectual as it is, if it were not divine.
As the demolishing the walls of Jericho proved that there was something more in
the sounding of the Rams horns, than the violent expulsion or percussion of
the air; so the conquering all the eloquence, and power, and wealth, and
wisdom of the world, and subduing it to the Gospel by the preaching of the
Apostles, poor, simple, and illiterate men, of no more account (in comparison
of the Orators and Philosophers of the heathen) than the Rams horns in
comparison of silver trumpets, demonstrateth that their words were not the
words of men, but the words of God. Zab. Phys.
Zabarel treating of nutrition in the stomach, and perfect concoction,
propounds this question; How comes it to pass, that heat being but an
accident and a simple quality, can digest our meat, sever the thicker parts
from the thinner, turn the chylus into chymus, and chymus into blood, and
disperse this blood into all parts? resolves it thus, that Heat may be
considered two ways; either as it is a mere quality and accident, and so it
has but one simple operation; or as it is an instrument of the soul, and so
it produces all the effects above mentioned. In like manner, if it be demanded

perfect, and thoroughly furnished to every good work: how it frames and
mouldeth the heart, how it printeth it like a stamp, melts it like fire,
bruizeth it like a hammer, pricketh it like a nail, and cutteth it asunder

power of God unto salvation, to every one that believes. This power we may
easily believe to be in the whole, when we see such efficacy in one text.
Junius in vita.
Junius was reclaimed from Atheism by casting his eye on the new Testament
lying open in his study, and reading the first words of S. John's Gospel; In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. These
words which struck such a reverence in the hearts of the heathenish
Platonicks, that they wrote them in golden letters in their Churches, so amazed
him with the strange majesty of the style, and profoundnesse of the mysteries
therein contained, that he never after entertained the least thought of his
former atheistical conceit. As Antony passing in his journey, and coming to a
Chapel, heard the Priest read those words in the Gospel, Luke 18.22.
If thou will be perfect, go sell all that thou have, and give to the poor,
and thou shall have treasure in heaven: he took the words as spoken to
himself in particular, and fulfilling the precept of Christ accordingly, of a
covetous worldling became a most holy recluse. What should I speak of S.
Austine, who was strangely converted by hearing a voice, saying; Toll, lege:
and fastening his eyes upon the first passage of Scripture he lighted upon,
which was this, Romans 13.13, 14.
Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in gluttony and drunkenness, not in
chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord
Jesus, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof. No
sooner was the verse read, than the work of his conversion was finished, and a
pious resolution for amendment of life settled in him. Aug. conf. l. 8. c. 12.
Surgens ab Alypio ut flerem, de vicina domo audivi vocem, Toll, lege: tum
cogitabam puerine solebant tale aliquid cantare, nec occurrebat audivisse me.
Uspiam represso impetu lachrymaru^, surrexi, interpretans me divinitus doceri
codicem aperire and legere. Itaque reversus ad locum ubi sedebat Alypius, ibi
enim posucram codicem, aperui and legi in caput quo conjecti sunt oculi mei,
Romans 13. Non in comessationibus, etc. Rem Alypio indicavi, petit videre quod
legissem, and ostendit ultra quam ego legeram quod sequitur, Infirmu^ in fide
assumite, quod ille ad se retulit.
Alypius certified hereof, desires to peruse the place, and falls upon the
verse immediately following; Him that is weak in the faith receive you, (Romans
14.1.) which he applying to himself, besought S. Austine to strengthen him in
the truth, according to the command of Christ to Peter, Luke 22.32. Tu
conversus, confirma fratres, When thou art converted, confirm thy brethren:
which task he so well performed, that with a little travel, in a short space
two twins were brought forth to Christ at one birth. To fasten the truth of
this observation, concerning the efficacy of Scripture texts seasonably
applied, I will borrow a golden nail from S. Chrysostom: It is not so in the
Church where the Word is powerfully taught, as it was in the Arc of Noah: for
there the beast that entered into the Arc, received no change nor alteration at
all by the imbarking there during the deluge: if they were clean at their
coming in, they were so at their going out; if they came in unclean, they
went out unclean; if they came in wild, they went out wild: but it is not so
here: we come in unclean, but we go out clean; we come in wild, we go out
tame; we come in wolves, we go out lambs; we come in lions, we go out
dear; we come in vultures, we go out doves; we come in beasts, we go out
men; or, to speak more properly, regenerate Christians. And thus much
concerning compunction in reference to the cause, as it is an effect of the
word preached: now let us consider it in a reference to the subject, as it is
an affection in the sinner.

The locusts are described by Apoc. 9.7, 10.
S. John with faces like men, but stings in their tails like scorpions: not to
disparage any mystical interpretation, a moral may be this: Sins,
especially of pleasure, like these locusts, have beautiful faces, and a
delightful appearance at the first: but those that deal and dally with them,
shall find that they have stings in their tails, and leave pricks and
venomous wounds in the conscience in the end; for after the act of sin is
committed, there is felt in all that have not seared consciences, remorse,
sorrow, fear, and shame: sorrow for the loss of Gods favor, and the jewels
of his grace, and the comforts of the Spirit; fear for the guilt of sin, and
shame for the filthiness and turpitude thereof. Of these three consists
compunction; which In verbo compunct. Compunctio est humilitas mentis cum
lachrymis, veniens de recordatione peccati, and timore judicii.
S. Isidore defines to be a dejection of the mind, with tears caused by the
remembrance of sin, and fear of judgment. By Ex Aquinate in supplement.
Humilitas mentis inter spem and timorem annihilans peccatum: nam ut vermis qui
nascitur in ligno lignum exest, ita dolor ex peccato peccatum ipsum absumit.
S. Gregory thus, A dejection of the mind full of anxietie, between fear and
hope, annihilating or destroying sin. For as the worm which breeds in the
wood consumes it, so (says St Chrysostom) the sorrow which arises from
sin consumes and destroys it. Pia proles hoc ipso quod devoret matrem, An
happy issue in this only, that it eats out the heart of the parent.

Thus I have pricked you out (to use the phrase of the Musicians) a lesson of
compunction; which though it be a sad pavin to the outward man, yet it is a
merry galliard to the inward. The physic which kindly works, and makes
the patient heart-sicke for the present, yet much comfort him out of assured
hope, that the present pain will bring future ease and help. The smarting
plaster is the most wholesome: such is that I have spread by the amplification
of my Text, and now I am to lay it to by the application thereof. If
compunction of the heart be the true mark of a penitent, let the eye of our
soul look into our heart, and see whether we can find it there. If we find it,
we may take comfort in it; if we find it not, we may be sure we are no true
converts. There is no virtue in the physic, if it pain us not: no force in
the plaster, if it smart not: the dis-located bone is not brought to his
place, if we felt no pain in the setting it. As the colors and shapes which
are burnt in glass, cannot be obliterated unless the glass be broken all to
pieces; so neither can the ougly shapes of vices and images of Satan be razed
out of the soul, unless the heart be broken with true contrition. Spices when
they are bruised and pownded in a mortar yield a most fragrant smell: O then
let us bruise our hearts with true contrition, Tertul. de poenitent. Miserum
est securi and cauterio exuri, and pulvoris alicujus mordacitate cruciari;
attamen quae per insuaviem medentur, and emolumento curationis offensam sui
excusant, and praesentem injuriam supervenientis utilitatis gratia commendat.
that our zealous meditations may be like fragrant spices in the nostrils of
God. If the Jews were pricked in heart at the remembrance of Christ's
suffering, if their hearts bled for once crucifying the Lord of life, how much
more ought ours for crucifying him daily? O think upon this (dearly beloved)
seriously both in the day and in the night, and let it make your beds to swim
with tears. As often as ye swear by the wounds of Christ, ye tear them
wider: as often as ye belch out blasphemy against God, ye spit upon your
Saviors face: as often as ye distemper your selves with strong wines, ye give
him vinegar to drink: as often as ye grieve the holy spirit, ye prick his very
heart: as often as ye unworthily receive the sacrament, ye tread his blood
under your feet. Me thinks I hear you sobbing and sighing out the words of the
Jews in my Text: If these things are so, if those sins are so heinous and
grievous which we have made so light of, Men and brethren, what shall we do? I
answer you in the words of Saint Peter following: Repent, and be baptized every
one of you; not in the font of sweet water in the Church, but in the salt water
of your tears: let your Cypr. de laps. Alto vulneri diligens, and longa
medicina ne desit poenitentia crimine minor non sit.
sorrow be answerable to your sinful pleasures, and bring forth fruits meet
for repentance. The wound is deep, thrust the tent to the bottom of it; your
sins have been many and grievous, let your tears be abundant, and your sighs
many. Ye have had a long time of sinning, give not over presently your
exercises of mortification: hold on your strict abstinence, your devout
prayers, your frequent watchings, your humble confessions, and sad meditations,
the whole time which the Church has prescribed you: by your sorrow here,
prevent eternal Tertul. de poenit. Fletu fletum, temporali afflictione aeterna
supplicia expungite: in quantum non peperceritis vobis, in tantum vobis parcet
Deus.
lamentations and woe: by your remorse of conscience here, prevent weeping and
gnashing of teeth hereafter: by your temporal affliction in this world,
prevent eternal malediction and endless torments of body and soul in hell:
the less you spare your selves in this kind, God will spare you so much the
more, and so much the sooner and easier be reconciled unto you. To whom, etc.

CHRISTIAN BROTHERHOOD. A Sermon preached on the second Sunday in Lent. THE
LXVIII. SERMON.
ACTS 2.37. And they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles; Men and
brethren.


MAny of the ancients write, that S. Luke was an excellent limmer, and drew the
blessed Virgin to the life: how true it is that he took the picture of the
mother of God, I know not (for the first relaters were Apocryphal writers) but
sure I am, in this text as a table he sets forth the children of God in
their colors, and describes them by their proper marks: which are three; 1.
In the ear. 2. In the heart. 3. In the hand.
1. The eare-marke is careful attention, when they heard. 2. The heart-marke
is deep compunction, they were pricked in heart. 3. The hand-marke is
sollicitous action, Men and brethren, what shall we do?


We have already viewed the ears of these converts, and found them bored
through for the perpetual service of God, and hung with the jewels of the
Gospel: next we searched into their hearts, and found them pierced with sorrow
for being some way accessarie (at least by consent) to the death of the Lord of
life: and now we are to look to their hands, and see what they will do, or
rather what they will not be willing to do, to make their peace with God, and
wash away the guilt of spilling his Sons blood.

Men and brethren, what shall we do? Ye hear (men and brethren) in this close
of the verse 1. A courteous compellation, which savoureth of 1. Humanity, Men.
Now they hold the Apostles men, Ver. 13.
whom a little before they esteemed no better of than drunken beasts. 2.
Charity, Brethren. Not aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, not strangers.
2. An important question, which is a question of 1. Fear, What shall we do
to escape the wrath to come for that we have done? 2. Care, What shall we do
to make some part of amends for our crimson sin, in shedding the blood of
that righteous and holy One? 3. Piety, What shall we do that we may reap
benefit by his death, whom ignorantly we slew with wicked hands?



Thus have I chalked unto you the way of my present and future discourses upon
this Scripture, wherein I entreat your attention and devotion to go along with
me, that I and you may first know in the speculative part what we are to do,
and then in the practicke do what we know to be necessary for the obtaining
the remission of our sins.

Men. Is there not a Pleonasmus or redundancy in the words Men and Brethren? Is
not this appellative men rather a burden than an ornament to the sentence? Are
there any brethren that are not men? Yes, if we will believe the Legend of
Saint Francis: for he found a new alliance and brotherhood amongst beasts,
ordinarily saluting them in this manner when he met them, Brother Ox, brother
Bear, brother Wolf (and it is marvel that the chronicles of his life related
not that some of them resaluted him again by the title of brother Ass for his
labor.) But this is a note beneath Gammoth, and a degree below lowliness it
self: for humility will admit none to be of her kindred and brotherhood, that
bear not the image of God our Father. The beasts of the field are indeed
fellow creatures with us, but they are our juments and servants, no way our
brethren. Was then the word men added to intimate that such is the inhumanity
or unmanlinesse of many, that a man may meet with many brethren by blood, by
alliance, by profession, by country, who yet deserve not the style of men,
because brethren without all humanity, and so no men: without heart or courage,
and so no men: effeminate in their speech, habit, carriage, trim and dress,
and so no men? Neither can this be the meaning of the words. For the Jews were
not now in a Satyricall vein, but like men that had been newly let blood by a
deep incision, they speak faintly, and in an humble manner beseech their
Physicians to prescribe what they must do to recover their health. We are
therefore to understand that in the original there is no pleonasme, nor bitter
sarcasme, but an elegancie and an emphasis in our tongue: there is but one name
for men of the better sort and inferior rank: but in greek there are two,
(...) the word here used, and (...), and they differ as much as air and earth,
or crystal and glass, or pearl and stone: for (...) signifies an ordinary
man of the vulgar sort, but (...) a man of parts, a man of worth, a man of
note, a man full of humanity, pity, and compassion: and herein they secretly
couch an argument, to induce the Apostles to take some care of their souls; as
if they should say, Though ye are men of God, yet ye are men as we are: the
divine graces in you bereave you not of humane passions. Suffer then not men as
you are to be cast away, bring not the blood of this righteous man upon us,
pity us in this our perplexity, pray to God for us, advise us what we are to
do, stretch a hand of charity to us, to pluck us out of the chops of Satan,
and flames of hell fire.

Me thinks I should pass this note in so Christian an auditory, and not stand
to prove that we ought to be men, not like beasts without reason, not like
monsters without all bowels, without natural affection and compassion: yet
were many that call themselves brethren men, could they grind the faces of the
poor as they do? could they not only tondere, but deglubere, not only sheare,
but flea Christ's sheep? were they men, would they use men like beasts? would
they make themselves beasts, and express the condition of the worst of beasts,
by returning with the dog to their vomit, and with the sow to their wallowing
in the mire? are they men, who take greatest delight in drowning their reason,
and extinguishing that light of understanding in them which makes them men?
are they men? have they hearts of flesh? have they eyes consisting of an
aqueous humor, who suffer men made after Gods image to pine away before their
eyes for want of a crumme of their store, a grain of their magazine, a drop of
their ocean, a mite of their treasury, a cluster of grapes of their vintage, a
gleaning of their harvest? are they men, that never remember the affliction of
Joseph, that never think of the besieged in Rochel, of the persecuted in
Bohemia and the Palatinate, and almost all parts of Germany, as good men as
themselves, and better Christians, who endure either the violence of
oppression, or the shame of infamy, or the servitude of captivity, or the
insolency of tyranny, or the griping of famine, or the terrors of sundry kinds
of death? It grieved the Orator to proclaim (...), O my friends, there is no
true friend among you: but it much more grieveth those that are to give an
account of your souls, to be enforced to complain, Men and brethren, there
are few men or brethren among you, but few that deserve the name of men, and
fewer of

Brethren. They call the Apostles brethren, either in a kind of correspondency
of courtesy, because the Apostles so styled them before (Men and brethren,
Ver. 29.
let me freely speak unto you of the Patriarch David) or to insinuate
themselves into their love; (...) quasi (...), co-uterini, sprigs issuing out
of the same root, men issuing out of the same womb, 1. Either of flesh, as
brothers that have the same mother. 2. Or of the Church, as all that are newborn in it. 3. Or of the earth, as all men.


Some who delight more in the sound of words than soundness of matter, make
their cimbals thus tinckle in our ears: There are brethren (say they) of three
sorts, either by race, as all of the same lineage: or by place, as all of the
same country or city: or by grace, as all of the same religion. But I like
better of St. Cont. Helvid. c. 7. Scriptura divina dicit fratres, 1. natura, 2.
gente, 3. cognatione, 4 affectu: quod postremum dividitur in spirituale and
commune: spirituale, quo omnes Christiani fratres vocantur; commune, quo omnes
homines ex uno patre nati pari inter se germanitate conjunguntur.
Jeromes distinction of brethren: 1. by nature or blood: 2. by cognation or
affinity: 3. by nation or country: 4. by love and affection: 1. common, to all
men, the sons of Adam our father: 2. special, to all Christians, the sons of
the same mother the Church.

1. Nature made Jacob and Esau brethren. 2. Affinity our Lord and James
brethren. 3. Nation or country Peter and the Jews brethren. 4. Affection and
obligation 1. Spiritual, all Christians, 2. Carnal and common, all men
brethren.

Thus the significations of brother in Scripture, like the circles made by a
stone cast into the water, not only multiply, but much enlarge themselves: the
first is a narrow circle about the stone, the next fetches a bigger compass,
the third a greater and more capacious than it, the fourth so large that it
touches the banks of the river: in like manner, the first signification of
brethren is confined to one house, nay to one bed and womb, the second
extends it self to all of one family or lineage, the third to the whole
nation or country, the fourth and last to the utmost bounds of the earth. No
name so frequently occurreth in Scripture as this of brethren, no love more
often enforced than brotherly. We need not go far for emblemes thereof,
Plut. de amor. fratr.
Plutarch has found many in our body: for we have two eyes, two ears, two
nostrills, two hands, two feet, which are, as he terms them, (...), brethren
and twinne members, formed out of like matter, being of one shape, one
bigness, and serving to one and the self same use. Nature her self kindles
the fire of brotherly love in our hearts, and God by the blasts of his Spirit,
and the breath of his Ministers blows it continually: yet in many it waxes
cold, and in some it seems to be quite extinguished. Saint Paul prayed that
the Philippians Phil. 1.9.
love might abound more and more. He exhorts the Hebrews, Let brotherly
Heb. 13.1.
love continue: but we need now-adaies to cast our exhortation into a new mold,
and say, Let brotherly love begin in you. For were it begun, so many quarrels,
so many factions, so many sects, so many broiles, so many law-suites would not
be begun as we see every day, set on foot. Did we look upon the badge of our
livery, which is mutual John 13.35. By this all men shall know that ye are my
disciples, if ye love one anther.
love, we would cry shame of our selves for that which we see and hear every
day, such outcries, such railing, such cursing, such threatening, such banding
opprobrious speeches, such challenges into the field, and spilling the blood of
those for whom Christ shed his most precious blood. Is it not strange that they
should fall foul one upon another, who have bin both washed in the same laver
of regeneration? that they should thirst after one another blood, who drink
of the same cup of benediction? that they should lift their hands up one
against another, for whom Christ spread his hands upon the cross? Let there be
no Genesis 13.8.
falling out between me and thee (says Abraham to Lot) for we are brethren.
Let me press you further, and touch you nearer to the quick* Let there be no
strife among you; for you are members one of another: nay, which is more, Ye
are all members of Christ Jesus. What? members of Christ, and spurn one at
another? members of Christ, and buffet one another? members of Christ, and
supplant one another? members of Christ, and devour one another? members of
Christ, and destroy one another? It is true as Plutarch observes, that the
nearer the tie is the fouler the breach. As bodies that are but glewed
together, if they be severed or rent asunder, they may be glewed as fast as
ever they were; but corpora continua, as flesh and sinews, if any cut or
rupture be made in them, they cannot be so joined together again, but a
scarre will remain: so those who are only glewed together by some civil
respects, may fall out and fall in again, without any great impeachment to
their reputation or former friendship; but they who are tied together by nerves
and sinews of natural or spiritual obligation, and made one flesh or spirit
together, if there fall any breach between them, it cannot be so fairly made
up, but that like the putting a new piece of cloth into an old garment, the
going about to piece or reconcile them makes the rent worse. When Cic. famil.
ep. l. 9. Noli pati litig^re fratres, and judiciis turpi^us conflictari.
Tully understood of a suit in law commenced between Quintus and M. Fabius, he
earnestly wrote to Papirius to take up the matter: Cic. famil. ep. l. 9. Noli
pati litig^re fratres, and judiciis turpi^us conflictari.
Suffer not (says he) brethren to implead one another. For though suits about
title of lands seem to be the fairest of any, yet even these are foul among
brethren: wherefore (my beloved brethren) let us

1. Prevent all occasions of difference: let there be no tindar of malice in
our hearts ready to take fire upon the flying of the least spark into it: let
us so root and ground our selves in love, that no small offense may stir us:
let us endeavor by all friendly offices so to endeare our selves to our
brethren, and so fasten all natural and civil ties by religious obligations,
that we always keep the Ephesians. 4.3.
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

2. If it cannot be but that offenses will come and distract us, if the Devil
or his agents cast a firebrand among us, let us all run presently to quench
it: let us imitate wise Mariners, who as soon as they spy a leake spring in
the ship, stop it with all speed, before it grow wider, and endanger the
drowning of the vessel.

3. After the breach is made up, and the wound closed and healed, let us not
rub upon the old sore, according to the rule of Coel. Rodig. antiq. lect. l.
16. and 19.
Pythagoras, Ignem gladio ne fodias, let us not rake into the ashes or embers
of the fire of contention lately put out. As we pray that God may cast our
sins, so let us cast our brothers trespasses against us into the Micah 7.19
bottom of the sea. The Athenians (as Plut. lib. de fraterno amo^e.
Plutarch writes) took one day from the month of May, and razed it out of
all their Calenders, because on that day Neptune and Minerva fell out one with
another; even so let us Christians much more bury those days in perpetual
oblivion, and strike them out of our Almanacks, in which any bloody fray or
bitter contention has fallen among us. For our Father is the God of peace: our
Savior is the Prince of peace: our Comforter is the Spirit of peace and love.
God who is John 4.8.
love, and of his love has begot us, loves nothing more in the children of
his love, than the mutual love of his children one to another. Mat. 23.8.
Ye are all brethren: love therefore as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous,
not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing; but contrariwise 1 Pet
3.8, 9.
blessing, knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a
blessing. As beams of the same sun, let us meet in the center of light: as
rivelets of the same spring, join in the source of grace: as sprigs on the
same root, or twins on the same stalk, stick always together. Such was the
love of the Saints of God in old time, that their hearts were knit one to the
other: yea, which is more, All the believers had but Acts 4.32. The multitude
of them that believed, were of one heart, and of one soul.
one heart. But such love is not now to be found in our books, much less in
our conversations: we hardly believe there can be such love in believers; we
seem not to be of their race, we seem rather to be descended many of us from
Coelius, who could not be quiet if he were not in quarrels; who was angry if
he were not provoked to anger: whose motto was, Dic aliquid, ut duo simus; Say
or do something, that we may be two: or from Sylla, of whom Valerius Maximus
writes, that it was a great question whether he or his malice first expired:
for he died railing, and railed dying: or of Eteocles and Polynices, who as
they warred all their life, so after a sort they expressed their discord and
dissension after their death: for at their funerals the flame of the dead
corpses parted asunder when they were burned. When the Son of man comes,
shall he find Luke 18.8.
faith on the earth (says our Savior?) I fear we may demand rather, shall he
find charity on the earth? All the true family of love may seem to be extinct:
for the greater part of men, as if they had been baptized in the waters of
strife, from the font to their tombstone are in continual frettings, vexings,
quarrels, schism and faction. Turba gravis paci placidaeque inimica quieti.

But let these Salamanders, which live perpetually in the fire of contention,
take heed, lest without speedy repentance they be cast into the lake which
burns with fire and brimstone forever. If Mat. 5.9.
blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God;
cursed are all make-bates, for they shall be called the children of the wicked
one. If the fruits of Jam. 3.18.
righteousness are sown in peace of them that make peace, certainly the
fruits of iniquity are sown in contention by them that stir up strife and
contention. If they that sow Pro. 6.16, 19. These six things does the Lord
hate, yea seven are abomination unto him: a false witness that speaks lies,
and he that sows discord among brethren.
discord among brethren are an abomination to the Lord, they that plant love
and set concord are his chief delight. What Cic. tusc. 1. Optimum non nasci,
proximum quam citissime mori.
Silenus spoke of the life of man, The best thing was not to be borne, the next
to dye as soon as might be, may be fitly applied to all quarrels and
contentions among Christian brethren; it is the happiest thing of all that such
dissentions never see light: the next is, if they arise and come into the
Christian world, that they dye suddenly after their birth; at the most let them
be but like those (...), small creatures Aristotle speaks of, whose life
exceeds not a summers day. Let not the Ephesians. 4.26.
sun go down upon our wrath. How can we long be at odds and distance, if we
consider that we are all brethren by both sides? For as we call one God our
Father, so we acknowledge one Church our Mother: we have all sucked the same
breasts, the Old and New Testaments: we are all bred up in the same school,
the school of the cross: we are all fed at the same table, the Lords board:
we are all incorporated into one society, the communion of Saints; and made
joynt-heires with our elder brother Christ Jesus of one Kingdom in Heaven. If
these and the like considerations cannot knit our hearts together in love,
which is the bond of perfection, the Heathen shall rise up in judgment and
condemn us. Mart. epig. lib. 1. Si Lucane tibi, vel si tibi, Tulle, darentur,
Qualia Ledaei fata Lacones habent, etc.
Martial writes of two brothers, between whom there was never any contention
but this, who should die one for the other: Nobilis haec esset pietatis rixa
duobus,
Quod pro fratre mori vellet uterque prior.
The speech also of Pollux to Castor his brother is remarkable, Mart. epig.
lib. 1.
Vive tuo, frater, tempore, vive meo.

I cannot let pass Antiochus, who when he heard that his brother Seleuchus,
who had been up in arms against him, died at Galata, commanded all the Court
to mourn for him; but when afterward he was more certainly informed that he
was alive, and levied a great army against him, he commanded all his Commanders
and chief Captains to sacrifice to their gods, and crown themselves with
garlands for joy that his brother was alive. But above all, Plut. de fraterno
amore.
Euclid showed in himself the true symptoms of brotherly affection, who when
his brother in his rage made a rash vow, Let me not live if I be not revenged
of my brother, Euclid turns the speech the contrary way, Nay, let me not live
if I be not reconciled to my brother; let me not live if we be not made as good
friends as ever before. Shall nature be stronger than grace? bonds of flesh tie
surer than the bonds of the spirit? one tie knit hearts together faster than
many? The Cic. offic. l. 1.
Orator says, Omnes omnium charitates patria complectitur; but we may say
more truly, Omnes omnium charitates Christus complectitur, all bonds of love,
friendship, affinity and consanguinity, all neernesse and dearnesse, all that
can make increase or continue love, is in Christ Jesus, into whose spirit we
are all baptized, into whose body we are incorporated, who in his love
sacrificed himself to his Fathers justice for us, who gives his body and
blood to us in this sacrament to nourish Christian love in us. For therefore we
all eat of one bread, that we may be made one bread; therefore we are made
partakers of his natural body, that we may be all made one mystical body,
and all quickened with one spirit, that spirit which raised up our head Christ
Jesus from the dead. Cui, cum Patre, etc.

THe words of the wise (says Eccles. 12.11.
Solomon the mirror of wisdom) are like to goades, and to nails fastened by
the masters of the assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. Mark, I
beseech you, what he says, and the Lord give you a right understanding in all
things: he says not, verba sapientum sunt calamistri, but stimuli: not
Salvianus de prove. l. 1. cap. 1.
lenocinia, sed remedia; not sweet powders, but medicines: not crisping pins to
curle the locks, or set the hairs in equipage, but like goades piercing
through the thick skin, and like nails pricking the live flesh, yea the
very heart root, and drawing from thence tears, sanguinem animae, the Aug.
Sermon. de temp. Lachrymae sanguis animae.
blood of the wounded soul. Such were the words of Saint Peter in this Sermon,
wherewith he tickleth not the ears of the Jews with numerous elocution, but
pricked their hearts with godly compunction. Which effects of his divine and
soule-ravishing eloquence, Saint Luke punctually notes (as Mr In. Act. c. 2.
Concionis fructum refert Lucas, ut scramus non modo in lingu^rum varietate
ex^rtam fuisse spiritus sancti virtutem, sed in eorum etiam cordibus qui
credebant.
Calvin judiciously has observed) that we might not think that the holy
Ghost, which came down upon the Apostles in the likeness of fiery tongues,
and enabled them to speak diverse languages which they had never learned,
resided in the tongue, but descended lower into the heart, and wrought there a
wonderful alteration, of stony making them fleshie; of obdurate, relenting; of
obstinate, yielding; of frozen, melting. Tully does but flatter his mistress
eloquence in proclaiming her flexanimam, Queen regent of the affections of the
mind. That style is due to the power of the word and the grace of the spirit,
which boweth and bends, frames and moldeth the heart at pleasure. It is the
sword Heb. 4.12.
of the spirit which is mighty in operation, and carnem mortificat, and Deo in
sacrificium offert; kills the flesh in us, and sacrifices it unto God. It is
the point of this sword which opens the Aposteme of corrupt nature, and
lets out all the impure matter of lust and luxury, by pricking the quickest
veins in the heart. Wherefore that wanton and crank dame, who blushed not to
profess that she was more moved at a play than at a Sermon, either by that
profane speech of hers bewrayed that she played at Sermons, and never fastened
her ears to the Preacher, that he might fasten his goads and nails in her
heart; or Mercenar. phys. dilucid. obscus. dict. Aristot.
intus apparens prohibuit extraneum, the evil spirit had before taken up her
heart, as he did a like gallants in Rome, who, as Li. despectac.
Tertullian writes, when he was adjured by a Saint of God, and demanded how
he durst seize upon any that professed the Christian faith, answered, In meo
reperi, I caught her in my own ground, I found her at the Theater, she came
within my walk, and therefore I took her as a lawful prize: or lastly, she
never came prepared to the hearing of the Word as she ought, she never laid her
heart asoake in tears to make it tender, she never prayed to God to direct the
penknife in the hand of the spiritual Chirurgian, to prick the right vein by
a seasonable reprehension like to this of Saint Peter's in my text, which when
the Jews heard,

They were pricked in heart, etc. See (says Saint Chrysostom. in Act. Homil. 5.
(...). ib. (...), etc.
Chrysostom) what meekness is, and how it pierces the heart deeper than
rigor and severitie of reproof. It is not the storm of hail and rain that
ratleth upon the tiles, and makes such a noise, but the still kind shower
that sinketh deep into the earth; the soft drops pierce the hard stones. (...).

The Surgeon who intends to prick a vein deep, first strokes the flesh, and
gently rubbeth it to make the vein swell. He that makes an incision in the
body of a patient that has tough and hard flesh, puts him to little or no
pain at all: but if he mollify the flesh first, and then apply his sharp
instrument unto it, the party shrinketh at it: even so says the skillful
Surgeon of the mind sores, If we would do good upon our patients, we must
first make the heart tender, and then prick it: now that which mollifieth the
heart, and makes it tender, is not rage, nor heat of passion, nor vehement
accusation, much less bitter taunts and reproaches, but the Gal. 6.1.
spirit of meekness; in which Saint Peter sought to restore his countrymen the
Jews. For though they had murdered his and our Lord and Master, and much
injured his fellow servants the Apostles, yet he speaks unto them as a father
or a careful master; he tells them indeed of their fault, yet aggravateth it
not, that he might not drive them to desperate courses; but excusing it by
their ignorance, he offers them grace and pardon upon very easy terms, that
grieving for their sins of a deeper die, they would look upon him by faith
whom they had pierced, and with wicked hands nailed to a tree. By which sweet
insinuation, though he brought them not so far as to justifying faith and
repentance unto life, yet they came on a good way; for they were pricked with
remorse for that they had done, and they express a desire to make amends, if
it might be, and refer themselves to the Apostles farther direction and
instruction, saying, Men and brethren

What shall we do?

I may say of this question, as Tully of Brutus his Cic. famil. epist.
laconicall epistle, quam multa quam paucis? how much in how little? but two
words in the (...).
original, yet issuing from three affections, fear, sorrow, and hope. 1 Fear
says, What shall we do to fly from the wrath to come? 2 Sorrow says, What
shall we do to undo that we have done? 3 Hope says, What shall we do to
purchase a pardon for our bloody minds, if not hands, and to obtain the
promise that you tell us is made to us, and to our children?


First of these words as they are a question of fear. The tree of forbidden
sin bears three fruits, and all bitter, 1 Guilt. 2 Loss. 3 Turpitude.


And these fruits breed in the stomach of the soul three maladies, 1 Shame. 2
Sorrow. 3 Fear.
1 The turpitude in it or deformity breeds shame. 2 The loss by it breeds
hearts-griefe and sorrow. 3 The guilt of it breeds terrors and fears.


Peradventure some man may be found so armed with proof of impudency, that he
cannot be wounded with shame: and we see many so intoxicated with the present
delight of sin, and so insensible of the loss by it, that they take no
grief or thought for it. But I never yet read or heard of any that sinned with
a high hand, but his own heart smote him with fear. For where sin is of a
deep die, not washed out with penitent tears, there is guilt; where guilt is,
there must needs be an expectation of condign punishment; and where this
expectation is, continual fear. The sinners conscience tells him that his
fact is unjust, and God is just, and therefore in justice will give injustice
his just reward, either in this life, or in that which is to come. As Antipho
through a disease in his eye, thought that he had his own Image always before
him: so he that has charged his conscience with any abominable, or very foul
and bloody crime, sees always before him the ougly image of his sin, and
hideous shape of his deserved punishment. Hae sunt impiis assiduae
domesticaeque furiae: Cic pro Rose. Amer.
these are the ghosts that haunt wicked men, these are the furies that follow
them with torches, and scorch them with flashes of hell fire: these suffer them
not, non modo sine cura quiescere, sed ne spirare quidem sine metu: these make
them fly when no man pursues them, cry when no man smiteth-them, quake when
no man threatens them, languish in a cold sweat when no fit is upon them.
Juvenal sat. 17.
-- frigidamens est
Criminibus, tacita sudant praecordia culpa.


When Cic. ib. Sua quemque fraus, and suus terror maxim vexar: suum quemque
sc^lus agitat, suae mal^ cogitationes cons^ientiaeque animi terrent.
they are alone and quiet, out of all other noise, they hear their sin cry
for vengeance. At which huy and cry they are so startled, that though many be
sometimes free from the cause of their fear, yet they are never free from
fear of danger. Every shadow they take for a man, every man for a spy, every
spy for an accuser. As in a fever, the greater the fit is, the more vehement
the shaking: so the more horrid the sin is, the more horrible the dread. The
sin of the Jews in giving consent to the saving of a murderer and the
murder of the Savior, is beyond comparison, and therefore their fear beyond
measure. As a child that has committed some great fault, and expects to be
fleaed for it, cries to his master, What shall I do? Or a passenger suddenly
benighted, when he perceives that he is riding down a steep rock, cries to
all within hearing, Oh what shall I do? Or a patient that is in a desperate
case feels unsufferable pain, and apprehends no means of ease, cries to
his physician, What shall I do? Or a seafaring man in a storm in the night,
when he hears the water roar, and fears every moment to be swallowed up in
the sea, cries to the Pilot, What shall we do? In this perplexity, in this
fright, in this agony are the Jews in my text; and from hence is this speech
of distracted men, What shall we do?

This their fear ought to strike a terror in us all, who have our part in
their guilt; for we by our sins have and do provoke the Father, grieve the
Spirit, and even crucify again the Son: how can we then but fear when we
hear Gods threats against sin? when we see daily his judgments upon sin?
when we remember our Saviors sufferings to satisfy Gods justice for sin?
How dare we draw iniquity with cords, and sin with cart-ropes? How dare we
kick against the pricks? How dare we make a covenant with death, and league
with hell? How dare we hatch the cockatrice egg? How dare we lie at the
mouth of the Lions den? Let no man say in his heart when he plotteth
wickedness, or commits filthiness in the dark, no eye sees me, and
therefore what need I fear? for he that has eyes like a flame of fire,
pierces the thickest darkness, and discovers every hidden room in thy
house, and corner in thy heart: he sees thee in secret, and will reward thee
openly, if thou by smiting thine own heart prevent not his blows, as the
Jews did in my text, saying, What shall we do? This interrogation rises from
three springs or heads: 1 Fear of punishment. 2 Sorrow for sin. 3 Hope of
pardon.


A man in fear driven to an exigent, being now at his wits end says with
himself, What shall I do? likewise, a man overwhelmed with cares, and ready
to be drowned in sorrow, as he is sinking cries, Oh! what shall I do, or what
will become of me? The fruit of sin is sweet in the mouth, but bitter in the
stomach: like poison given in a sugared cup it goes down sweetly, but it
kindles a fire in the bowels: it tickleth the heart in the beginning, but it
pricks it in the end: it is pleasure in doing, it is sorrow when it is done.
Saint Bernard speaks feelingly, Sin after it is perpetrated leaves in the
soul a sad farewell: amara and foeda vestigia, where the devil has set his
foot there remains after he is gone a foul print, and a stinking sent.
Though the sinner use all means to dead the flesh of his heart, though he make
it as hard as flint, or the nether millstone, yet conscience writes in it, as
with the point of a Diamond, this sentence of the eternal Judge of quick and
dead, Romans 2.9.
Tribulation and anguish upon every soul that sins. They that stabbed
Caesar, afterward turned the point of the same dagger upon themselves: so it
is certain that no man by sin grieveth Gods Spirit, but he wounds himself
with sorrow. If the sprayning a vein, or dis-locating a bone, or putting a
member out of joint, or distempering the blood, be a pain to the body: how much
more is the distorting the will, the disordering the affections, the quenching
the light of reason by sin, a torment to the soul? There is no man that has
not lost his senses, but has sense of great losses: and what loss comparable
to the loss of Gods favor and love, the comforts of the spirit, and the
treasures of his grace? Though a sinner should gain the whole world by his
sin, yet would he be a loser: for at the present he hazzardeth, and without
mature repentance he loses his own soul. To speak nothing of loss of time
by idleness, of wit by drunkenness, of strength by incontinencie, of health
by intemperancie, of estate by prodigality, of credit and reputation by
lewdness and dishonestie: besides the guilt of sin, and loss by it, there
is great folly in it, which vexes the mind, and discontenteth the spirit of a
man: his thoughts perpetually accusing him in this manner: This thou might
have done, and here thou befooledst thy self, and thou have brought trouble
and shame upon thee: thou may thank thy self for all the mischiefs that
have befalne thee.

Yea, but ye may object, Are sin and sorrow such individual companions? is
there no sorrow but for sin, and the effects of it? no sin without sorrow?
What say you then to them that have their conscience 1 Timothy 4.2.
seared as with an hot iron? they surely feel no pain. What sense have they
of the guilt of sin, of Gods wrath, who are cast into a reprobate sense? I
would the case were as rare as the answer unto it is easy and expedite. Admit
a seared conscience feels no pain, was not the searing of it think you a
pain? The heart that is like the anvile, and now hardened for the purpose,
felt many a blow, and endured many fearful strokes before it came to be so.
Although Mithridates in the end felt little hurt or pain by drinking poison:
yet before he brought his body to that temper, he never took any draught of
poison, but it was both painful and perilous to him. A man must needs have
many conflicts within him, many terrors and unsufferable troubles of mind,
before he be utterly deprived of all sense by the frequencie and vehemency of
his torments: and though those that are cast into a reprobate sense never after
come to repentance, yet God oftentimes restores them to their sense of sorrow,
and sight of the ugliness of their sin, and horror of their punishment,
that even in this life they might taste of eternal death. As he did to Nero,
when in a fit of desperation he cried out, Have I no friend nor enemy to rid me
out of my pain? And Julian the Apostata, who tare his bowels, and flung them
into the air, saying, Vicisti Galilee. Brutus Plutar. in vit. Brut. Iterum me
Philippis videbis.
his malus genius, the ghost that haunted him at Rome, though for the present
it left him, yet it met with him again at Philippi a little before his death.
So those terrors and consternations of mind which possessed the wicked before
their consciences were seared, though for many years they leave them, yet a
little before, or at the time of their death they return again in more
violent manner, and so they pass from death to death, from sorrow to sorrow:
nay, I may say truly, from hell to hell.

But why do I stand so long upon this sorrow, which may be without repentance?
because repentance cannot be without it? Compunction does not always end in
godly sorrow, but godly ever begins in it. This compunction of pricking the
heart deep, is like the digging the earth to set the seeds of faith and
repentance, and all the slippes of the flowers of Paradise: or the needles
making a hole in the cloth or stuff; the needle fills not up the bracke or
rent, but the thread or silk, but only it makes entrance for them. So the
pricking the heart with the needle of Calv. in Act. Hoc poenitentiae initium
est, imo ad pietatem ingressus, tristitiam ex peccatis nostris concipere, ac
malorum nostrorum sensu vulnerari: qua^diu enim securi sunt homines, fieri non
potest ut serio animum attendant ad doctrinam; sed compunctioni accedere debet
promptitudo ad parendum. Compuncti fuerunt Cain and Judas, sed obstitit
desperatio, quo minus se Deo subjicerent; nam men's horrore occupata, nihil
aliud quam fugere Deum potest.
compunction makes way for the graces of faith and true repentance, which make
up the rent and mend our lives. Beloved, if ye are pricked in heart for your
sins, I cannot say it is well with you; but if ye have never been pricked
for them, I must say it is very ill with you. The Philosophers distinguish of a
double heat, 1 Inward and natural, which preserves life. 2 Outward or
ambient, which disposes mist bodies to putrefaction by drawing the other heat
Mercenar. l. de Putred. cont. Erast. Putredo est eductio caloris naturalis a
calore ambiente.
out of them.


In like manner there is a double sorrow for sin. 1 A sorrow arising from an
inward cause, the consideration of the goodness of God, and the malignancie of
sin: the equity of the law, the iniquity of our transgressions: and this is a
seed of, or degree unto repentance unto life. 2 A sorrow for sin arising from
an outward cause, the expectation of dreadful punishments for sin, both in
this life, and the life to come, both temporal and eternal: and this, if it
be not assuaged with some hope disposes a sinner to desperation, as we see in
Cain, Esau, and Judas, whose sorrows were not any way medicinal, but penal.


No means to prevent, but rather to assure hellish torments, being a kind of
earnest of them. Cain was pricked in heart for the murder of his brother Abel,
in such sort that he filled the air wheresoever he fled with this lamentable
cry, My Genesis 4.13.
punishment is greater than I can bear. Esau would have redeemed his
birthright with a large cup of Heb. 12.17.
tears, which he sold for a small mess of pottage: but his tears were spilt
upon the ground, not put into the Lords bottle. Judas had sorrow enough, if
that would have helped him; for to stifle his hearts grief he strangled
himself: and no doubt he long swelled with pain before he burst asunder Act.
4.18.
in the midst, and his bowels gushed out. Wherefore as the Apostle Saint Paul
in another case exhorts the Thessalonians, so let me exhort you, to weep
for your sins, but not 1 These. 4.13.
as those that have no hope. Sorrow for your sinful joys, humble your selves
for your pride, fast for your luxury, watch for your drowsinesse, howl and
cry for your crying sins; yet not as those that are without hope. For if the
Jews here, who spilt the blood of the Son of God, were quickened by it, how
much more shall they that wash Christ's wounds and their own with their tears,
find in his blood the balm of Gilead to cure their pricked hearts, and wounded
consciences?

But then, as the Jews here, they must be solicitous after the means. They
must enquire of the Apostles or their successors, Quid faciemus? What shall
we do? if not to undo what we have done, yet to make some part of amends,
so much as we can, and which through Gods goodness shall so be taken of us,
that our sins shall not be imputed to us. And they said,

What shall we do? Saint Chrysostom well observes, that they ask not, How
shall we be saved? but, What shall we do? It is presumptuous folly to
enquire of, or hope for the end if we neglect the means. If a man might go
to heaven with a sigh, many a Balaam would be found there, for he fetched a
deep sigh, saying, Let me die the death of the righteous. If crying, The
Temple of the Lord, or saying, Lord, Lord, almost at every word, would without
any more ado make a man free of the heavenly Jerusalem, all the Pharisees
among the Jews, and hypocrites among Christians should be denisons there. But
Christ himself assures us to the contrary, not every one that says Lord,
Lord, Mat. 7.21.
shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the will of my
Father which is in Heaven. Doing and life, working and salvation, running and
obtaining, winning and wearing, overcomming and reigning, in holy Scripture
follow one the other. Wherefore the young man puts the question to our Savior,
What Mark. 10.17.
thing shall I do that I may attain evelasting life? and the people likewise,
and the Publicans, and the Soldiers to Luk 3.10.12.14.
S. John, and the keepers of the prison to Act. 16.30.
Saint Paul, and the Jews in my text to Saint Peter, and the rest of the
Apostles, What shall we do? not, What shall we say? or, What shall we
believe? but, What shall we do? This is the tenor of the Law, Do this and
thou shall live. Whosoever does these things shall never fall. And the Gospel
also carries the same tune full: Mat. 7.24.
If ye know these things happy are ye of ye do them. He that hears and
does builds upon a rock. Not the hearers, but the doers of the James 1.22.
Ezekiel. 1.8.
Law shall be justified. Why are the Cherubims described with the hands of a
man under their wings, but to teach us that none shall see God, who under the
wings of faith and hope (whereby they fl^e to heaven) have not the hand of
charity to do good works? As Darius used the Macedonian soldiers, whom he
took prisoners; so the devil does those over whom he has any power: he
cutts off their hands that they may be able to do no service. The heathen
Philosopher observed, that of three of the best things in the world, through
the wickedness of men, three of the worst things proceeded and grew: 1 Of
virtue, envy. 2 Of truth, hatred. 3 Of familiarity, contempt.
We Christians may add a fourth, viz. of the doctrine of free justification
carnal liberty. The catholic doctrine of justification by faith alone is the
true Nectar of the soul, so called (...), because it keeps from death: yet
this sweetest Wine in the Spouses Flagons proves no better than Vinegar, or
rather poison in their stomachs, who turn grace into wantonness, and liberty
into license. -- fit Nectar acetum,
Et vaticam perfida vappa cadi.


But let no man adulterate the truth nor impose upon Christ's mercy what it will
not bear; nor endeavor to sever faith from good works, lest he sever his
soul from life. For though faith justify our works before God; yet our
works justify our faith before men: though the just shall Habac. 2.4. Romans
1.17.
live by his faith, yet this his faith must live by James 2.20.
charity: as never man any dyed with a living faith, so never any man lived by
a dead faith. I grant, when we have all done we may, nay we must say, Luke
17.10.
We are unprofitable servants: yet while we have time Gal. 6.10.
we must do good unto all, especially to those of the household of faith. None
may trust in their own righteousness; but on the contrary, all ought to pray
that they may be found in Christ, Phil. 3.9.
not having their own righteousness: yet their righteousness must exceed the
Mat. 5.20.
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, or else they shall never enter
into the kingdom of heaven. It is evident unto all, except they be blind,
that the eye alone sees in the body, yet the eye which sees, is not alone in
the body without the other senses: the forefinger alone points, yet that
finger is not alone on the hand: the hammer alone strikes the bell, yet the
hammer which strikes is not alone in the clock: the heat alone in the fire
burns, and not the light, yet that heat is not alone without light: the
helm alone guides the ship, and not the tackling, yet the helm is not alone,
nor without the tackling: in a compound electuarie Rubarb alone purges choler,
yet the Rubarb is not alone there without other ingredients. Thus we are to
conceive, that though faith alone does justify, yet that faith which
justifies is not alone, but joined with charity and good works. Many please
themselves with a resemblance of Castor and Pollux, two lights appearing on
ships, sometimes severally, sometimes jointly. If either appears by it
self, it presageth a storm; if both together, a sudden calm: yet (with
their good leave be it spoken) this their simile is dissimile. For those lights
may be severed and actually are often, but justifying faith cannot be severed
from charity, nor charity from it. Thus far only it holds, that unless we
have a sense and feeling of both in our souls, we may well fear a storm. S.
Bernards distinction of via regni, and causa regnandi, clears the truth in
this point: Though good works are not the cause why God crowns us, yet we
must take them in our way to heaven, or else we shall never come there. It is
as impious to deny the necessity, as to maintain the merit of good works. --
sed Cynthius aurem
Vellit.


The time calls me off: and therefore that it may not exclude me, I will
conclude with it. In this holy time of Lent three duties are required, Prayer,
Fasting, and Alms: prayer is the bird of Paradise; fasting and alms are her
two wings, the lighter is fasting, but the stronger is alms; use both to carry
your prayers to heaven, that you may bring from thence a blessing upon you,
through the merits and intercession of Jesus Christ. Cui, etc.

THE LAST OFFER OF PEACE. A Sermon preached at a public Fast. THE LXX. SERMON.
LUK 19.41, 42. 41. And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept
over it,

42. Saying, If thou had known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the
things that belong to thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes.


WHen the Romans fought a pitched field, after the ranks of their prime
Leaders and chief Soldiers (which they called Principes) had charged
valiantly, if the enemy still kept his ground, the Triarii (containing the
whole shock of the army) put on, and upon their prowess and valor depended
the fortune of the day and chance (if I may so speak) of the bloody die of
war. Whereupon it grew to be a proverb, Eras. chil.
Res rediit ad Triarios, it now stands upon the Triarii: as if you would say,
it is now put to the last plunge. And is it not so now, my Christian brethren?
We have taken to us the proper weapons of Christians, fasting, prayers, and
tears, to fight against the fearful combinations of powerful and vigilant
enemies. The rank of our Principes, the King himself, the Princes, Nobles, and
Peers have already watered this field with their tears, and put on with all
their force of zealous prayers: how far they have prevailed, God only knows.
Jam ad Triarios res rediit, now the whole shock of the army, and the maine
battle is to advance, and upon the sincerity of the humiliation, and fervency
of devotion, and strength of our united prayers and sighs this day, depends
much the safety and life of our State, and in it of our Church, and in it of
our true and incorrupt Religion.

Let no man go about with Mercuries enchanted rod to close the eyes of our
Argus's; let no man sow pillowes under the elbowes of our true Patriots, to
make them sleep in security, lest destruction steal upon us at unawares. It is
certain our enemies sleep not, and it is most certain that our crying sins
have awaked Gods justice: it stands us therefore upon to watch and pray.
Judgment is already begun at the house of God, the Angel has poured out his
vial of red wine upon the Churches of Bohemia, and their fields are thick
sown with the blood of Martyrs: the same Angel has emptied another vial upon
the Churches in the Palatinate, and the sweet Rhenish grape yields in a manner
now no liquor but blood: a third vial runs out at this hour upon the
reformed Churches in France, and our sins as it were holloe to him to stretch
his hand over the narrow sea, and cast the dregs of it on us, who have been
long settled upon our lees: and undoubtedly this will be our potion to drink,
if we stretch not our hands to heaven, that God may command his Angel to stay
his hand. If he have already turned his vial, and we see drops of blood
hanging in the air; yet the strong wind of our prayers may blow them away and
dispell them, in such sort that they shall not fall upon us: a gale of our
sighs may clear the sky. Moses prayers manicled the hands of Almighty God,
and shall not the united devotions of this whole Land either stay or turn his
Angels hand? Away with all confidence in the arm of flesh, away with all hope
in man, away with all cloakes of sin, and vizzards of hypocrisy, there is no
dissembling with God, no fighting against him. Albeit our land be compassed
with the sea as with a moat, and environed with ships furnished with ordnance,
as with brazen and iron walls: though the most puissant Princes on earth should
send us innumerable troops to succor and aid us, yet we have no fence: for
(...) we lie open to heaven, we are naked to the arrows of the Almighty, and
no carnal weapons for succors can stand us in any stead; only the helmet of
salvation, and the buckler of faith, and the powder of a contrite heart, and
the shot of pious ejaculations may do us some good. It is our pride (Beloved)
that has thrown us down, and it is humility which must raise us: our
divisions have weakened us, and it is union that can strengthen us: our luxury
has imbezelled us, and now nothing but fasting and abstinence can recover us:
our sins have made a breach, and nothing but repentance can make it up: our
profane oaths, our sinful pleasures, our carnal security and sensuality has
driven away the Spirit of grace and comfort from us, and nothing can woo him
to return back again but our vows of amendment, unfeigned tears and
sorrowful sighs. Let us therefore ply sighs and Cyp. ep. 1. Incumbamus

prayers: for these are the spiritual weapons we alone can trust to, through
the intercession of Christ's blood, which speaks better things for us than the
blood of Abel. These weapons our Lord himself made trial of in my Text, and
sanctified them to our use, viz. passionate tears, and compassionate prayers.

When he drew near to Jerusalem, and foresaw in spirit that she drew near
to her ruin, his eyes melted with tears (he beheld the City, and wept) and
his heart breaks out into sighs (Oh that thou knew.) Tears trickle not
down in order, neither are sighs fetched by method. Expect not therefore from
me any accurate division, or methodicall handling of this passionate Text:
only in the first place fasten the eye of your observation upon the eyes of our
Savior, and you shall discern in them, 1. Beams of love, He beheld. 2.
Tears of compassion, He wept over it.


In the next place bow the ears of your religious attention toward his mouth,
and ye shall hear from him, 1. Sighs of desire, Oh (or if) that thou knew.
2. Plaints of sorrow, But now they are hid from thine eyes.

steadily, I have laid out for you five knolls or steps to rest upon and pawse.
1. Venit, He came. 2. Vidit, He beheld. 3. Flevit, He wept. 4. Ingemuit, He
sighed. 5. Oravit, He prayed.


1. Venit or appropinquavit, he drew near. The end of our Saviors life here
was the sacrifice of his death: he was borne that he might die for us, and by
one oblation of himself on the cross, satisfy for the sins of the whole
world. Now all sacrifices by the Law were to be offered at Jerusalem; to
Jerusalem therefore he comes up to finish the work of our redemption: and he
makes the more haste, because Easter was near at hand, when he was to eat
the Paschall Lamb with his Disciples, and to be eaten of them in the
mysterious rite of the Sacrament: to kill the passover in the type, but to be
killed himself in the truth. Oh, how far has our Savior left us behind him
in his love? He came with a swift foot to us, we return with a slow foot to
him: he made more haste to give himself, than we make to receive him. After
he received the commandment from his Father to lay down his life for his
sheep, he rode more cheerfully into Jerusalem, and was led more willingly to
the altar of the cross, where he lost his life, than we repair to his holy
table, there to be partakers of the bread of eternal life. He came near to
the City, that he might view it: he viewed it, that he might weep over it: he
wept over it, that he might testify a threefold truth, 1. Naturae, of his
Nature, 2. Amoris, of his Love, 3. Doctrinae. of his Doctrine or prophecy.


1. Veritatem naturae, the truth of his humane nature. He must needs be a true
man, who out of compassion sheds tears, (...), sic fatur lachrymans. Cold
stone or metal relenteth not, a phantasme grieves not, a picture weepeth not:
these tears then of our Savior may serve as haile-shot to wound all such
Heretics as imagined that Christ had but an imaginary body.

2. Veritatem amoris, the truth of his love. It is true love which resolves it
self into tears upon the sight or apprehension of another loss, grief, or
danger. When Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus, the Jews said, Behold how he
Joh. 11.36.
loved him: and when the Disciples and whole multitude saw Christ weep as
soon as he came in sight of Jerusalem, they could not but say within
themselves, Behold how he loves this city.

3. Veritatem prophetiae, the truth of his prophecy concerning the destruction
of Jerusalem, and all the calamities that shortly after befell the Jewish
nation: they must needs be true evils and judgments certainly to come upon the
city, which the Son of God foretells with wet eyes.

Quum appropinquavit, (...), when he came near. If Christ in his humane body
could have been present in many places at once, as the Trent Fathers teach,
and our Bell. lib. 3. de sacr. Euch. c. 3. and 4.
Romanists set their faith upon the tenters to believe; he then might have
spared many a wearisome journey, he needed not to have traveled as he did from
country to country, and city to city: all the progresses which he made through
Judea, and Galile, and Samaria, and the coasts of Tyrus and Sidon, might have
been saved. For without stirring his foot, by this doctrine, he might have
presented himself at the same time in Nazareth, and Bethlehem, and Corazin,
Bethsaida, and Capernaum, and Nain, and Jerusalem: as, if we may believe
Aelian. de Var. hist. lib. 4. Pythagoras eodem die and hora visus est in
Metapentio, and Crotona, and in Olympo femur aureum ostendit.
Aelian, Pythagoras at the same time was seen in diverse cities, and there
showed his golden thigh (a fit miracle for aurea legenda, the golden legend)
sed quia non legimus non credimus, but because we find no such thing in
Scripture we believe it not. We are so far from finding it there that we find
the direct contrary: Math. 28.6.
He is not here, for he is risen. If there be any force at all in this reason
of the Angel, the humane body of Christ cannot be in more places at once: for
could it be in more places at once, it might have been in the grave and risen
out of it at the same time, which the Angels for supposes to be impossible.
Hector adest, secumque deos in praelia ducit.

In this battle against the Trent faith we have men and Angels on our side;
for as the Angel argues here from the impossibility of the existence of
Christ's body in more places at once, so do the ancient fathers. Lib. 4. contr.
Eutic. Christi corpus quando in terra fuit, non erat utique in coelo: and nunc
quia est in coelo, non est utique in terra.
Vigilius, Christ's body, when it was upon earth, was not at the same time in
heaven: and now because (...) is in heaven, it is not therefore upon earth: and
Saint Aug. l. 20. cont. Faust. Manic. c. 11. Secundum praesentiam spirituale^?
nullo modo pati illa possit secundum praesentiam corporalem? simul in sole, and
luna, and cruce esse non possit.
Austine, When ye Manichees teach that Christ was at the same time in the Sun
and in the Moon, and upon the Cross, what mean ye by presence? his divine
and spiritual? that is nothing to your purpose; for according to that he
could not suffer. Do you mean corporal? according to that he could not be
together in more places, and consequently not (as ye suppose) in the sun, and
in the moon, and upon the cross at once. As the Poets faigne of Hercules,
that in his cradle, with one graspe of his hand he killed two serpents: so by
the handling of this one circumstance (if the time, and this present occasion
would permit me) I might kill two monsters of heresies, the former of
transubstantiation, which you see lies half dead before you; the latter of
consubstantiation: the former holds a multi-presence, and the latter an
omnipresence, or ubiquity of Christ's body. The word appropinquavit, he came
near, reaches a blow home to both these. For coming near a place is a
local motion. Now every local motion must have a terminus a quo, and a
terminus ad quem; a place or point to be left, and another to be got: which
cannot be verified in a body, which in the same time is in utroque termino, in
the term from which, and the term to which it is to move: much less can an
infinite or omnipresent body move locally: because such a body, according to
their supposition, fills all places, and consequently cannot go from one to
another: i^ ^^nnot lose any place it had, or acquire any it had not. This
coming here then of our Savior to Jerusalem, proves that the Lutherans and
all ubiquitaries are as far out of the way (in this point) as Papists: they
that hold this error, must blot out all Christ's gests recorded by the
Evangelists, and reverse all his progresses from Judea to Galile, and from
Galile to Judea: from Jerusalem to Nazareth, and from Nazareth to Jerusalem:
from land to sea, and from sea to land. Moreover, to entitle a creature to
ubiquity is to deifie it, and to attribute this incommunicable property of the
deity to the humane nature of Christ, is to confound his two natures. Thus
heresies unnaturally engender, the later with the former, and Lutheranisme
begets Eutychianisme: at which monstrous error, though the Romanists are
startled; yet the heresy of transubstantiation which they foster at this day
is of the same cast. Admit once that Christ's body may be at the same time in
heaven at the right hand of his Father, and on the Altar in the right hand of
the Priest: why may it not be in milions of places? if it may be wheresoever
masses are said, why may it not also by divine power be where they are not
said? why not then every where? if it may stand with the unity of an
individual body to be in two distinct and distant places at once, it may as
well be in two hundred places; and if in two hundred, in two thousand; and if
in two thousand, every where. The nature of an individual body, which is to be
indivisum in se, and divisum a caeteris omnibus, is as well destroyed by
putting it in two places at once, as in two millions. Wherefore, as wood
cleavers drive out one wedge by another, and conjurers cast out one spirit by
another as bad; and as Plato took down Diogenes, trampling upon his rich
carpet, Eras. Apoph.
and saying, I tread Platoes pride under my feet: Calcas fastum, sed alio
fastu; thou treadest upon my pride (says he) but out of as great or greater
pride: so our adversaries the Papists may be justly taxed for exterminating one
error, the error of consubstantiation, by bringing in another as bad, the
error of transubstantiation, which puts accidents without subjects,
quantity without dimensions, bodies without place, and what not? Sueton in
Calig. Utinam populus Romanus haberet unicam cervicem.
Caligula wished that all his enemies had but one neck, that he might cut
them all off at one blow: the three heresies now mentioned have all but one
neck, I will therefore smite off all their heads at once with the sword of the
Spirit. Christ was like unto us in all things, sin only excepted: if so,
then was he circumscribed with quantity, and confined to one place at once:
then not in many places, as the Papists teach; and much less in all places, as
the Eutychians and Lutherans bear us in hand he is.

But to leave the confutation of these heresies, and draw near unto our
present occasion. Christ never came to any place but he left behind him some
print of his Majesty, or pledge of his love: he touched no where, but he
wrought some miracle, or showed some mercy. If the presence of the Arc, which
was but a type or shadow, brought a blessing to Obed Edome: how much more shall
the presence of the body, and the truth himself, make the place happy
wheresoever he resideth? Jesus never comes without salvation with him: and
therefore when he entered into the house of Zaccheus, he laid, Hodie huic domui
salus contigit, this day salvation Luke 19.9.
is come to this house. The approach of the Sun is the spring and joy of the
year: even so the approach of Christ is the blo^^oming of the trees, and
opening the flowers of Paradise: it crowns ^oth the Church and Commonwealth
with spiritual and temporal blessings, as it were garlands, one upon the
other.

Yea, but how may his approach be obtained? who can entreat him to come near
us? what lodestone can draw his love to us? I answer, Our love, our faith, our
hope, our devotion.

James 4.8.
Draw near unto God, and he will draw near unto you. Draw near unto him by
faith, accedit qui credit, faith lays hold on him. Draw near unto him by
hope, hope relieth upon him: Draw near unto him by love, love embraces him,
and Psalm. 73.28.
adhereth to him: Draw near unto Esa. 29.3.
him with your lips by prayer, with your Eccles. 5.1.
ears by listening to his Word: draw near with your whole body by presenting
your selves at his table, and worthily participating the holy Sacrament. Thus
if ye draw near to him, he will draw near to you, and coming near to you as
he did to Jerusalem, he will fix his eyes on you. And so I pass to the
second step:

2. Vidit, he beheld it. There is comfort when the Physician comes to visit
his patient: there is hope when an expert Surgeon vieweth a dangerous wound.
David thought it enough to say, Look Psalm. 25.18.
upon mine affliction and misery: and, Psalm. 84.9.
Look upon the face of thine anointed: and, Lord lift Psalm. 4.8.
thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. God never casts his eye upon
any, but he settleth his affection upon him: and he never settleth affection
upon any without an intention of blessing them. As Christ cured men's bodies
with a word, so their souls with a look. He looked upon Peter, and presently
he repented: he looked upon Zaccheus, and presently he was justified: he
looked upon Saint Matthew, and presently he was called: Why then was Jerusalem
no better for this gracious aspect? because she shut her eyes against the true
light. When Christ looked to her, she turned away from him: when he wept for
her, she laughed at him: when he sought to save her, she plotted his death and
destruction. Yet were not the beams of Christ's eye cast in vain upon this
City; for the spiritual Jerusalem, as Saint Orig. in hunc locum.
Origin tells us, that is, the faithful in Jerusalem were the better for
them: for they observed our Saviors eye, and kept his tears in a bottle, and
laid up his words in their heart; and being fully persuaded of the truth of his
prediction concerning the destruction of the City and Temple, when forty years
after Titus began to lay siege to it, they left it, and fled to Pella, and
thereby escaped all those miseries and troubles which our Savior could not
foretell with dry eyes. The Philosophers and Physicians are not yet agreed
utrum visio fiat extramittendo vel intromittendo, whether in the act of seeing
the eye casts out beams upon the object, or receives species from it. The
question is easily resolved here: for Christ both cast out a beam of his
affection out of his eye on the City, and received also the species or image of
it into his eye: at once he looked upon her with a twofold eye, 1 The eye of
sense. 2 The eye of Prophecy.


To the eye of sense Jerusalem appeared most beautiful, glorious, and happy,
environed with strong walls, adorned with magnificent buildings, stored with
people abounding in wealth, and furnished with all sort of munition: but to the
eye of prophecy she appeared in another hiew, with her walls sacked, her
houses burnt, her turrets demolished, her young men slain, her virgins
defloured, her priests sacrificed, her streets piled with carcasses, and her
channels running with gore blood. Vir. Aenead. 2
-- Quis talia fando
Temperet a lachrymis?


This most lamentable spectacle, though a far off, drew tears from our
Saviors eyes. And so I pass to the third step, which is the wettest of all:

3. Flevit super eam. He wept over it. In the water of Christ's tears we may
see after a sort the face both of his humane and divine nature. In that they
were tears issuing from the troubled fountain of sorrow in his heart, they
prove him to be a true man: but in that they represented the weeping and
mourning that should ensue after his death in Jerusalem, they demonstrate him
to be true God: for Tertul. apol.
argumentum divinitatis veritas divinationis, the certainty of divination is an
argument of divinity. Neither were these tears only indices naturae,
evidences of his nature, but pledges of his love, and (as Orig. in Mat. Omnes
be^titudines quas in Evangelio locutus est, suo firmavit exemplo.
Origin notes) instances of his doctrine touching the blessedness of
mourners. Christ exemplified every point of his doctrine in himself: he taught
that the poor in spirit are blessed, and none so humble in heart as he: he
taught that peacemakers were blessed, and who so great a peacemaker as he,
who is our peace, and reconciled heaven and earth? he taught, blessed are they
that suffer for righteousness sake, and none ever suffered so much as he: he
taught, blessed are they that mourn, and he wept himself, sanctifying thereby
tears, and assuring all godly mourners here, of comforts hereafter. Gor. in
Luc. c. 19. Christus quater flevit, 1. in nativitate, Sap. 7. Primam vocem
nobis similem emisit plorans. 2. In Lazari suscitatione, Joh. 11. Lacrymatus
est Jesus. 3. in hac solenni processione, flevit super eam. 4. in passione,
Heb. 5. Haec sunt quatuor flumina quae de Paradiso prodierunt, Genesis 2. ad
totius mundi, 1. ablutionem. 2. refrigerationem. 3. foecundationem. 4.
potationem.
Gorrhan observed that Christ shed tears four times, first at his birth, next
in the raising of Lazarus, a third time in his surveigh of Jerusalem, and a
fourth time on the cross: and these four, says he, are spiritually the four
rivers of Paradise, which serve 1. to purge: 2. to cool and refresh: 3. to
water and make fruitful: 4. to quench the thirst of the world of believers.
Notwithstanding I find in the Gospel but two leaves only wet with our Saviors
tears, Joh. 11. and here. It is likely he cried at his birth after the manner
of other children; and it is certain that he offered up prayers upon the
cross with strong cries: yet we read not of any tears shed by him but here
on Mount Olivet, and at Lazarus his grave, and both tears were tears of
compassion, and both also funeral tears. There he wept for the death of
Lazarus, and here for the final period, and, if I may so speak, funerals of
Jerusalem, to be solemnized with desolation, and exceeding great mourning, like
that of Hadradrimmon in the valley of Megiddo, within a few years after his
passion. It was the manner of the Prophets, when they foretold the calamities
that were to fall upon any people or nation, to express them as well by signs
as by words, to make a deeper impression in their hearers. Ahiah 1 Kings 11.30.
cut Jeroboams cloak, Jeremy breaks his Jer. 19.10.
bottle, Ezekiel Ezekiel. 5.1.
shaveth his beard, Agabus Act. 21.11.
binds himself. In like manner, Christ prophesying the final overthrow of
the City and Temple, represents the great sorrow, mourning and lamentation of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem by his own tears. Theodoret yields another
reason: Alii flent ex passione, Christus ex compassione: Others weep (says he)
out of passion, Christ out of compassion: Ut ostenderet qualia haberet erga
ingrates viscera; to show what bowels he had toward the ungrateful though
they least deserve tears, who have no sense at all of their own misery, yet
they most of all need them. It grieveth me (says S. Cypr. de laps. Plango
quia te non plangis.
Cyprian) that thou grievest not for thy self: mine eyes are wet because thine
are always dry: I have little comfort, because there is little or no hope of
grace in thee. Ea fletus majoris causa est, cum rideant qui flere debeant; we
have the greater cause to mourn, when they laugh who ought to weep. Jerusalem
was now in a fit of frenzy, she laughed, and feasted, and revelled, even now
when she was near utter ruin and confusion: and this more opened the salt
springs in our Saviors eyes; he shed tears the more abundantly by reason of
the carnal security, obstinacy, and senseless stupidity of the Jews his
Countrymen, and especially the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who killed the
Prophets, and stoned them who were sent unto them to fore-warne them of Gods
fearful judgments hanging over their heads.

I told you before that this was a wet step, and many here have slipped: For this
objection offers it self to every man's conceit: Was not Christ God, and
consequently omnipotent? could not he have prevented their final overthrow?
could not he have given those Jews believing and relenting hearts? could he
not have converted them all miraculously by a vision from heaven, as he did
St. Paul, who before that powerful change wrought in him, was as much enraged
against the professors of the Gospel as any of these? nay more? Did not Christ
foresee and decree the destruction of Jerusalem? how then does he bemoane it
with tears? Calv. harm. in evang. Sicut e coelo descendit Christus carne
humana indutus, ut divinae salutis testis esset, and minister, vere humanos
induit affectus; quatenus susceptae functioni intererat, quatenus datus erat
huic populo minister in salutem, pro officii sui ratione illius exitium
deploravit. Deus erat fateor, sed quoties oportuit doctoris officio fungi,
quievit, ac se quodammodo abscondidit deitas.
Calvin reaches us a hand to help us off of this wet knoll: As (says he)
Christ descended from heaven clad with humane flesh, that he might be a
witness and minister of divine salvation, he truly put upon him also humane
affections, so far as it was requisite for the discharge of his function:
therefore as being sent as a minister for the salvation of that people, in the
faithful execution of his office he forewarned them of their danger, and
bewailed their overthrow, which could not but ensue upon their obstinacy and
impenitency. He was God I acknowledge, and most certainly foresaw what would
befall the City, according to his eternal decree; but whilst he performed
the office of a teacher, the deity rested as it were, and hid it self. That
ye may take faster hold upon this stay, which this learned Interpreter
reaches unto you, ye are to consider Christ three manner of ways: 1. As God,
2. As man, 3. As Mediator between God and man.


As God he most justly sentenced that bloody City to utter ruin and
desolation; as man he could not but be touched with grief and sorrow for
those heavy judgments which hung over the city and people, they taking no
course at all to prevent or avert them; as Mediator betwixt God and man, he
might and ought ex officio, both bewail what he foretold, and foretell what
he now bewailed: and that most seriously. For pro quibus nunc lachrymas,
postea effudit sanguinem; for he shed his blood for those for whom he now shed
tears: and it was their own fault, that this death was not effectual to them
for their redemption and salvation. An all-sufficient remedy was tendered unto
them, but they would none of it; and even this also, as it aggravated their
sin, and consequently their punishment, so it increased their spiritual
Physicians grief, and drew more tears from his eyes: Utinam, Domine, ut
verbum caro factum est, sic cor meum carneum fiat; Oh that as the word was made
flesh, so my heart were made fleshly and tender, to receive a deep impression
of my brethrens grief. Such a heart was Jeremies, which evaporated into these
sighs, Jer. 9.1.
Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes fountains of tears, that I might
weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people. Such was Saint
Paul's, 2 Cor 11.29.
Besides those things that are without, that which comes upon me daily, the
care of all the Churches: who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended,
and I burn not? Of the same temper was Saint Cyprian, I Cypr. ep. 16.
Compatior and condoleo fratribus nostris, qui lapsi and p^rsecutionis
infestatione prostrati, and partem nostrorum viscerum secum trahentes acrem
dolorem suis vulneribus intulerunt. Et l. de laps. Cum plangentibus plango, cum
deflentibus d^fleo, cum prostratis f^atribus me quoque prostravit affectus.
sympathize and condole with you for those of our brethren, whom the cruelty of
persecution has overthrown, and laid upon their backs: the wounds which they
have received no less pain me, than if part of my bowels had been plucked
out of my body. And again, I mourn with them that mourn, and weep with them
that weep, and am cast down with them that are fallen. This sympathy is a more
noble work of mercy and charity toward our afflicted brethren, than bounty it
self: he that spends his affection upon his brother in his distress, does
more than he that reaches unto him an alms: for the one gives somewhat out
of his purse, the other out of his bowels: on the contrary, want of natural
affection is ranked with the worst of all vices, Romans 1 31.
(...), being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness,
maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, back-biters, haters of God,
disobedient to parents, covenant breakers, without natural affection,
implacable, unmercifull. Doubtless they are monsters in nature that want
bowels: nothing more provoked God, in Salvian de Dei gubern. l. 6.
Confundebatur vox morientium, and vox bacch^nti^^m, and vix discerni poterat
plebis ejulatus qui fiebat in bello, and sonus populi qui clamabat in circo.
Salvianus his judgment, to double his strokes upon the French, when the Goths
came in upon them, than that they had no sense or feeling of their brethrens
calamities. The voice of the dying could hardly be distinguished from the
clamours of those that were drunk; at the same time when the people without the
City cried out for fear of the enemy, the people within the City shouted at
their sports. It is not safe for any to feast, when God calls to fast; to
sing, when God calls to sigh; to brave it in gorgeous apparel, when God
calls to sackcloth. Whose heart quaketh not at that thunderclap in the
Prophet Esaias? Esaias 22.12, 13, 14.
And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and mourning, and
to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth. And behold joy and gladness,
slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine. And it was
revealed in my ears by the Lord of hosts; surely this iniquity shall not be
purged from you till you die. The sin wherewith God charged the old world
before it was over-flowne with a deluge of water, and Christ in the Gospel
charge the new, which shall be over-flowne with a deluge of fire, is the same
wherewith he here charge the Jews, that they knew not, that is, took not
notice of the time of their visitation: Luk 17.26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
As it was in the days of Noah: so shall it be also in the days of the Son of
man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
marriage, ntill the day that Noah entered into the Arc, and the flood came and
destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot, they did eat,
they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same
day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and
destroyed them all: Even so shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall
be revealed. The meaning is, they went on in the ordinary tract of their
business, as if there had been no judgment toward, as also did the
inhabitants of Jerusalem at this time, whom when Jesus saw so near the brink
of destruction, and yet so careless, he wept; (...), when he considered what
he was to suffer for that City, and what that City afterward was to suffer
because of him, his grief ran over the natural banks his eyes.

The same organ is ordained for seeing and weeping, to teach us, that weeping
should not be without seeing, nor sorrowing without understanding. The cause
why we weep not for the desolation of our Jerusalem near at hand (if this our
present fasting and repenting in dust and ashes remove it not) is, because we
see not the evils that hang over our heads: we see them not, because we put
them far from us, or hide them from our eyes. The infant, while it lies in
the dark prison of the mothers womb, never quatcheth nor weepeth; but as
soon as ever it comes out of the womb into the light, it knits the brows,
and wrings the eyes, and cries, and takes on: even so the child of God,
whilst he is yet kept in the dark of ignorance, in his unregenerate estate,
never cries to his Father, nor weepeth for his sin; but as soon as the
light of grace shines upon him, he bewaileth his grievous misery, and never
thinks that he has filled his cup of tears full enough. The spouts will not
run currently, if we pump not deep. If then we would have the spouts which
nature has placed in our heads run abundantly with tears of repentance, we
must pump deep, we must dive deep into the springs of godly sorrow, which are
the consideration of our own sins, and the afflictions of Gods people. Were
Jesus now upon earth in his mortal body, and should behold this Kingdom as he
did the City of Jerusalem, and take a survay of all the evils we do, and are
like to suffer, could he (think you) refrain from tears? would he not second
his tears with groans? And so I pass to the fourth step:

4. Ingemuit, he sighed, saying, If thou knew, or, Oh that thou had
known. The Greeks in their Proverb give it for a character of a good man,
that he is much subject to sighing, and free of his tears: Eras. chil.
(...). I am sure the best man that ever was, as he wept more than once, so he
sighed often. When he opened the ears of the deaf and dumb, and when the
Pharisees seeking of him a sign tempted him, he Mar. 7.34. Looking up to
heaven, he sighed, and says unto him, Effata, be thou opened. Mar. 8.12.
sighed deeply in his spirit: and when he raised John 11.38. Jesus therefore
groaning in spirit comes to the grave.
Lazarus stinking in the grave; and again in my Text. And this he does not as
God (for immunity from passion is a prerogative of the divine nature) but, as
Calvin teaches, quia minister huic populo in salutem datus, as a minister of
salvation to this people. Here then I cannot but reflect upon mine own
calling, and preach to Preachers and all Ministers of the Gospel, that by the
example of our Lord and Master, the high Priest and Bishop of our souls, we
take chiefly and in a special manner to heart the calamities of Gods people,
and ruin of his Church. The eyes of our Savior here, as likewise of Esaias
22.4. I will weep bitterly: labor not to comfort me, because of the spoiling
of the daughter of my people.
Esaias, Jerem. 4.8. and 9.1.
Jeremy, and Ezra 10.1.
Ezra, glazed with tears, are looking-glasses, wherein we may see the duty
enjoined to us by the Prophet Joel, Joel 2.17.
Let the Priests, the Ministers of God, weep between the porch and the altar.
For in the spoiling of the country, and demolishing the Churches, and the
houses of Prophets and Prophets children, Gods honor suffers, whereof we
ought to be most jealous: the souls of men are in no less danger than their
bodies and estates, whereof we are to render an account; and as we are Gods
mouth to the people, to declare his will to them, so we are their mouth to God,
to present their supplications to him. All the measures of the Sanctuary were
double to the common. As the measure of our knowledge is greater, so the
measure of our g^iefe and sorrow in the affliction of Gods people ought to be
corresponding. The same proportion holds in sorrow and joy. And therefore as in
the common joy Saint Cypr. ep. 1. Exprimi satis non potest quanta ista
exultatio fuit. and quant^ laetitia cum de vobis prospera and fortia
comperissemus, ducem te illic conf^ssionis frat^ib^s extitisse, sed and
confessionem ducis de consensione fratrum creviss^, etc. Et Ep. 5. In com^uni
g^udio Ecclesiae Episcopi portio m^jor est, Ecclesiae enim gloria Praepositi
gloria est.
Cyprian allotteth the Bishop a greater portion; so also in the common grief
our portion must needs be the greatest. We stand upon the watch-towers of
Sion, and the people take notice of dangers from the fiering of our beacons: we
are as the praecentores chori, to give them the tune: we are as Trumpeters in
Gods army; and if the Trumpet be cracked, or give an uncertain sound, how
shall the soldiers prepare themselves to fight the Lords battles? If we (like
Epaminondas) ought to fast, that the people may feast the more securely: watch,
that they may sleep with more safety: weep, that they may rejoice more freely;
how much more ought we, being the Asaphs in this sad quire, accord with you in
your groans and cries, when we are struck with the same griefs and fears,
when the enemy aims not so much at the Commonwealth as at the Church, and
not so much at the body as at the soul of the Church, the Religion we
profess, and our most holy faith? O ubi estis fontes lachrymarum! O where are
you fountains of tears! where are gales of such sighs! such as love and
devotion, and sympathy breathes out in my Text, If thou knew. And so I pass
to the last step:

5. Oravit, he prayed, saying, O that thou knew, or, If thou knew. In
this prayer of our Savior, our thoughts may find themselves holy employment,
in seriously considering, 1. The manner or form of speech, which is 1.
Figurative, 2. Abrupt, 3. Passionate.
2. The matter, which presents to our spiritual view 1. The intimation of a
desire, O that, or, If. 2. The exprobration of Ignorance, Thou knew. 3. The
aggravation upon the person, Thou, even thou. 4. The designation of a time, In
this thy day.

The sentence rises by degrees, and Christ in every word grows more and more
upon Jerusalem. It is sin and shame to be ignorant, most of all for
Jerusalem, and that in the day of her visitation, especially of those things
that belong to her peace. If other Cities might plead ignorance, yet not thou:
if thou might plead ignorance at another time, yet not in this thy day: if in
this thy day thou might plead ignorance of other things, yet not of those
things that belong to thy peace.

To begin with the form and manner, which the more imperfect it is, the more
perfectly it expresses the passion, or rather compassion of the speaker. As a
cracked pipe or bell gives a harsh or uncertain sound, so a broken heart for
the most part utters broken speeches, interrupted with sighs. Constantine
kissed the empty holes where Paphnutius eyes were plucked out; and we cannot
but reverence the seeming emptiness and vacuity in Scripture sentences, where
the omission of something is more significant than the supply (if the speech
had been filled up) would have been. Those which have bin transported with
passion, utter half Calv. in harm. Scimus in quibus ardent vehementes
affectus, non nisi dimidiata ex part sensus suos effari.
sentences, and faulter in the midst of a period, as the father in the Poet,
who lost his only son, beginning to vent his grief, and saying, Filius meus
pollens ingenio, My son of rare parts, my son of great hope, there stops,
and before he could say mortuus est, is dead, became himself speechless.
Christ was here seized on by a double passion, 1. Of Commiseration, 2. Of
Indignation.


Commiseration out of the apprehension of the overthrow of Jerusalem, the Queen
of all Cities, and the Sanctuary of the whole earth.

Indignation at the obstinacy, ingratitude and bloodthirsty cruelty, and
desperate madness of the present inhabitants, who wilfully refusing the means
of their salvation, run headlong to their own perdition. I have been the
briefer in handling the form, that I might enlarge my self in the matter.

Thou knew. Ignorance of Gods judgments draws them upon a state: for the
Lord has a controversy with the land (says Hos. 4.1.6.
Hosea) because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land:
My people perish for lack of knowledge. The Schools rightly distinguish of a
double ignorance: 1. Facti, of the fact. 2. Juris, of the Law.
Ignorance of the fact in some case excuses, but not of the law, which all are
bound to take notice of: for Lex datur vigilantibus, non dormientibus; The law
is given to men that are awake, and may and ought to hear it, not to men when
they are asleep. The law, for the violation whereof the greatest part are
condemned, is written in the tables of their hearts, to exclude all plea of
ignorance: and certainly of all the errors of Popery, one of the grossest is
their entitling ignorance the mother of devotion: for so far is ignorance
from being the mother of any virtue, that it is both 1. Peccatum, 2. Matter
peccati, 3. Poena peccati.
It is sin, and the punishment of sin, and the parent of sin. First it is
sin; for God in the Law appointed a Levit. 4.2. and 5.15.
sacrifice for a trespass by ignorance: and the servant in the Gospel, which
knew not his Masters will, and therefore did it not, shall be beaten with fewer
Luke 12.48.
stripes indeed than the other, who knew his Masters will, and did it not, yet
with some. Secondly, it is the parent of sin, viz. of many errors in matter
of faith, which, are sins: This Psalm. 95.10.
people (says God) has erred in their heart, because they have not known my
ways. And Christ imputes the gross error of the Pharisees concerning the
resurrection to their ignorance of the Scriptures: Mat. 22.29.
Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. And it is also
the punishment of sin, as we read, Because they did not like to retain God
in their Romans 1 21, 28.
knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate sense, and their foolish heart
was darkened. Even this is a sin of ignorance, not to know that ignorance is a
sin. I speak not only of ignorantia pravae dispositionis, of wilful
ignorance, but also of nescience, which they call simple ignorance: why else
does the Prophet pray, Effunde aestum tuum in gentes quae te ignorant; Pour
down thine indignation upon the Psalm. 79.6.
nations that know thee not, and upon the people that call not upon thy Name?
Why does the Apostle threaten 2 These. 1.8
flaming fire to all that know not God? I would S. De gr^t. and lib arbitr. c.
3. Sed and ill^ ignorantia quae non est eorum qui scire nolunt, sed eorum qui
tantum simpliciter nesciunt, neminem sic excusat ut sempiterno igne non ardeat.
Austines censure might upon good ground from Scripture be qualified, where he
passes the sentence of damnation to eternal fire, even upon those who never
had knowledge of the means of salvation, and not only upon those who might have
known them if they would.

Yea, but we have all knowledge, our ignorance will not cast us, the clearest
beams of the Gospel have for these many years shined in our climate; we should
be most unthankful to him that dwells in an unaccessible light, if we should
not acknowledge as much. It is most true in these parts, as in the part of
heaven over our heads, we see continually many goodly stars, yea many
constellations of stars; but as about the South pole, so in diverse remote
parts of this Kingdom there is scarce any star to be discerned, or if any,
but a blinking star of the sixth magnitude. Yet to yield us a greater
knowledge than other nations, I fear that this plea will rather hurt us than
help us; if we could say truly we were blind, we should not have so much to
answer for: but John 9 41.
now, because we say we see, our sin remains, if we so perfectly know our
Masters will, and do it so imperfectly, a few stripes will not serve our
turn: De gubern. Dei lib 4 Quanto minore periculo illi per Daemonia p^jerant,
quam nos per Christum? Et nunquid tam criminosa est Hunnorum impudi^itia, quam
nostra? nunquid tam rep chensibilis Almanni ebrietas, quam Christi^ni?
Do ye think (says Salvianus) that the heathen so much dishonor God when
they forswear themselves by their false gods, as you when you forswear your
selves by the true? Do you think a Jew, or a Pagan, or a Papist by his
profane or loose life causes the truth to be so evil spoken of, as we that
have the word taught among us most purely, yet live impurely, who know better,
yet do worse? As we presume of our knowledge, so did Jerusalem, which is by
interpretation the Rob. Steph. interpret nominum Heb. and Ch^ld. Visio pacis,
seu visio perfecta.
vision of peace, much more; yet our Savior upbraideth her with ignorance,
saying,

Thou, even thou. Our Savior strikes twice upon the same string, he rubbeth
again and again upon the same sore: Thou, even thou. Thou which carriest
peace in thy name, think not thou of those things that belong to thy peace?
Jerusalem was once the light of the world, and yet behold she is darkness.
From Moses to the days of John Baptist, and from the days of John Baptist
till this present she was instructed by Seers sent from God, and directed to
the way of peace, yet she sees it not. Let those who assume to themselves most
knowledge, take heed lest they be like Pentheus, Sapientes in omnibus
praeterquam in iis in quibus sapientem esse convenit; wise in all things save
those where wisdom might stead them. Eurip (...).
He is not to be accounted a wise man (says the wise Eurip (...).
Poet) who knows simply most things, but who knows things of most use. Is
Jerusalem ignorant of the maine point of all, of the coming of the Messiah,
notwithstanding all the light she might have taken from the Law of Moses, and
from the visions of the Prophets, and from the doctrine and miracles of our
Savior? how gross then is that error of all the rest in the Romish Church,
by which she maintains and holds, that she cannot err? Was Jerusalem
seated upon so high a hill, so near heaven, obscured with the fumes arising
from the bottomless pit? and may not the City situated on seven hills have a
thick mist cast over her? What can she plead for her immunity from error in
matter of faith more than Jerusalem could? that faith was planted in her by S.
Peter? the Christian faith was planted in Jerusalem by Christ himself: that it
was watered in her with the blood of the Apostles? Jerusalem was watered with
the blood of Christ himself. If Rome can allege any one promise made to her,
Jerusalem can many. But to leave Rome, and come with a Nathans application to
our selves, me thinks, I hear Christ saying to us and our Church: If thou,
even thou, if thou which art the Queen of all the reformed Churches; if thou
which have enjoyed the sunshine of the Gospel without any eclipse by
persecution for more than 60. years; if thou who have had line upon line,
precept upon precept, admonition after admonition, and exhortation after
exhortation; if thou whom God has miraculously preserved from imminent
destruction by defeating the invincible Armado in eighty eight, and since
discovering the matchless powder plot; if thou, even thou, who sit quietly
under thine own vine, when all thy neighbor vines are plucked up by the roots,
or trampled under foot; if thou, even thou know not, or wilt not take notice
of the things that belong to thy peace,

At least in this thy day, that is, the day of thy visitation, the day of
grace, a day given thee for this end, to provide for thy peace, to call thy
self to an account, to consider how deeply thou have engaged Gods justice to
pour down the vialls of his vengeance upon thee, for thy rebellion against his
ordinances, thy corporal and spiritual fornication, thy resisting the spirit
of grace, thy peremptory refusing of the means of salvation, thy persecuting
the truth, even to the death, and imbruing thy hands in the blood of Gods
dearest servants sent to thee early and late for thy peace.

Jerusalem had a day, and every City, every Nation, every Church, every
congregation, every man has a day of grace, if he have grace to take notice of
it; has an accepted time, if he accept of it: and he may find God, if he seek
him in time. It was day at Jerusalem in Christ's time, at Ephesus in S. John's
time, at Corinth, Philippi, etc. in S. Paul's time, at Creet in Titus time, at
Alexandria in S. Marks time, at Smyrna in Polycarps time, at Pergamus in
Antipas time, at Antiochia in Evodius and Ignatius time, at Constantinople in
S. Andrew and Chrysostomes time, at Hippo in Saint Austines time; now in most
of these it is night, it is yet day with us: O let us work out our Phil. 2.12.
salvation with fear and trembling, whilst it is Heb. 3.7, 13.
called to day; if the Sun of righteousness go down upon us, we must look
for nothing but perpetual darkness, and the shadow of death. Although
Ninevehs day lasted forty days, and Jerusalems forty years, and the old worlds
120. years, and although God should prolong our days to many hundred years,
yet we should find our day short enough to finish our intricate accounts. That
day in the language of the holy Ghost is called our day, wherein we either do
our own will and pleasure, or which God gives us of special grace to clear
our accounts, and make our peace with him; but that is called the Lords day,
either which he challenges to himself for his special service, or which he
has appointed for all men to appear before his Tribunal, to give an account
of their own works. A wicked man makes Gods day his own, by following his
own pleasures, and doing his own will upon it, and living wholly to himself,
and not to God; but the godly makes his own days Gods days, by employing
them in Gods service, and devoting them as far as his necessary occasion will
permit wholly to him. Wherefore it is just with God to take away from the
wicked part of his own days, by shortening his life upon earth, and to give
to the godly part of his day, which is eternity in heaven.

I noted before a flaw and breach in the sentence, as it were a bracke in a
rich cloth of Tissu. If thou knew in this thy day: what then? thou would
weep, says S. Homil. in Evang.
Gregory: thou would not neglect so great salvation, says Comment. in Eva^g.
Euthyrtius: it would be better with thee, says Titus Bostrensis: thou
would repent in sackcloth and ashes, says Brug. in Evang.
Brugensis. But I will not presume to add a line to a draugh^ from which such
a workman has taken off his pensill, and for the print I should make after the
pattern in my Text, and now in the application lay it close to your devout
affections, I may spare my farther labor and your trouble: for it is made by
authority, which has commanded us to take notice of those things that belong
to our peace, viz. to walk humbly with our God by fasting and prayer:
wherefore jungamus fletibus fletus, lachrymas lachrymis misceamus; let us
conspire in our sighs, let us accord in our groans, let us mingle our tears,
let us send up our joint prayers as a vollie of shot to batter the walls of
heaven: let all our hearts consort with our tongues, and our souls with our
bodies: what we do or suffer in our humiliation, let it be willingly, and not
by constrant; and let our prayers and strong cries in public be ecchoed by the
voice of our weeping in private: who knows whether God may not send us an
issue out of our present troubles by means unexpected? who knows not whether
he may not have calicem benedictionis, a cup of blessing in store for those his
servants beyond the sea, who have drank deep of the cup of trembling? Christ
his bowels are not streightened, but our sins are enlarged, else it would be
otherwise with them and with us. I have given you a general prescription, will
ye yet have more particular recipe's? take then an electuary of four simples:

The first I gather from our Saviors garden, Let your Luke 12.35.
loins be girt, and your lamps in your hands. Let your loins be girt, that
is, your lusts be curbed and restrained; and your lamps burning, that is, your
devotions enflamed. Gird up your loins by mortification and discipline, and
have your lamps burning, both the light of faith in your hearts, and of good
works in your hands.

The second I gather from S. John Baptists garden, Matthew. 3.8.
Bring forth fruits meet for repentance, or worthy amendment of life: let your
sorrows be Cyp de laps. Quam grandia peccavimus, tam granditer defleamus.
answerable to your sinful joys, let the fruit of your repentance equal, if
not exceed the forbidden fruit of your sin; wherein ye have most displeased
God, seek most to please him. Have ye offended him in your tongue by oaths?
please him now by lauding and praising his dreadful name, and reproving
swearing in others. Have ye offended in your eyes by beholding vanity and
casting lascivious glances upon fading beauty enticing to folly? make a
covenant from henceforth with your eyes, that they cast not a look upon the
world, or the flesh's baits, employ them especially from henceforth in reading
holy Scriptures, and weeping for your sins. Have ye offended in thought?
sanctify now all your meditations unto him. Have ye offended in your sports?
let now your delight be Psalm. 1.2.
in the Law of God, let the Scriptures be your Aug. l. 11. confess. c. 2 Sint
deliciae meae Scripturae tuae, nec fallar in iis, nec fallam ex iis.
delicacies with S. Austine, meditate upon them day and night, make the Lords
holy day your delight, Esaias 58.15. and honor him thereon, not following your
own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words.

The third I gather from S. James his garden, Jam. 4.10.
Cast down your selves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. The Lion
contenteth himself with casting down a man: if he couch under him, and make
no resistance, he offers no more violence. Corpora magnanimo satis est
prostrasse Leoni.

It is most true, if we speak of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah: for he will
not break a bruised reed, much less grind to powder a contrite heart. If Ahabs
outward humiliation (who notwithstanding had sold himself to work wickedness)
in some degree appeased Gods wrath: how much will inward and outward
humiliation of the redeemed of God prevail with him to remove his heavy
judgments from us, which he inflicteth on us, especially to humble us? and if
he find us humbled already, he will doubtless lay no more load upon us.

The last I gather from King David's garden: Psalm. 2.12.
Kiss the Son. God has a controversy with us as he had with the Israelites
in the days of H^sea 4.1.
Hosea, and no man can plead for us, but our 1 John 2.1.
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. We have so far provoked
the Almighty, some by profaneness, some by superstition, some by indifferency
in point of Religion, some by covetousness and extortion, some by fraud and
falsehood, some by quarrelling and contention, some by swearing and blaspheming,
some by gluttony and drunkenness, some by chambering and wantonness, that he
has already taken hold of his glittering sword, and who in heaven or in earth
can or dare treat for our peace, but Christ our peacemaker, who has signed a
league of amity between God and all believers with his own blood? Wherefore, as
Themistocles, understanding that King Admetus was highly displeased with him,
took up his young son into his arms, and treated with the father holding
that his darling in his bosom, and thereby appeased the Kings wrath; so let us
come to the Father, with Christ in our arms: let us present our suites by him,
He is our Amb. l. 2. de Isaac. Ille oculus est per quem Deum videmus, ille
dextera est per quam Deo offerimus, ille os nostrum est per quod Patrem
alloquimur.
eye with which we see God, our hand by which we offer to him, he is our mouth
by which we speak to him. By this eye we look upon thee, O thou that dwell
in the heavens; by this hand we offer unto thee the incense of our zealous
affections; by this mouth we send up our prayers with our sighs unto thee.

O Lord turn thy face from our sins, and look on thy well beloved Son in thy
bosom: consider not our actions, but his passions: weigh not our
transgressions, but his merits: regard not our sinful pleasures, but his
painful torments: respect not our wicked life, but his most innocent death:
heal us by his stripes, cure us by his wounds, free us by his bonds, ease us
by his torments, comfort us by his agony, and revive us by his death. To whom,
with the Father, etc.
