sekenesses that fall or mysfortune to all manner of creatour^^ of god created /
practysed by many expert and wise masters / as Auicenna ^ other. etc. Also it

frontispiece: outdoor scene with man leaning on shovel and plucking grapes,
woman dumping plants or flower from apron into basket, trees in the background,
flowering plants front center, and male and female mandrakes at the front
corners

Considering the great goodness of almighty god creator of heaven and earth /
and al thing therein comprehended to whom be eternal laud and prays. etc.
Considering the course and nature of the four elements and qualytees where to
ye nature of man is inclyned / out of the which eleme^tes issues diverse
qualytees infyrmytees and dyseases in the corporate body of man / but god of
his goodness that is creator of all things has ordained for mankind
(which he has created to his own likeness) for the great and tender love /
which he has unto him to whom all things erthely he has ordained to be
obeysant / for the sustentacyon and health of his loving creature mankind
which is only made egally of the four elements and qualitees of the same /
and when any of these four habou^de or has more domynacyon the one than the
other than it co^strayneth ye body of man to great infyrmytees or dyseases /
for the which ye eternal god has given of his haboundante grace / virtues in
all manner of herbs to cure and heal all manner of sekenesses or i^fyrmytes to
him befallyng through the influent course of the four elements beforesayd /
and of the corrupcyons and ye venymous airs contrary ye health of man Also of
onholsam meats or drynkes / or holsam meats or drynkes taken ontemperatly
which be called surfetes that brengeth a man sone to great dyseases or
sickness / which dyseases ben of nombre and ompossyble to be rehearsed / and
fortune as well in vilages where as another surgeons nor phisicians be dwelling
nygh by many a mile / as it does in good towns where they be ready at hand.
Wherefore brotherly love compels me to write through ye gifts of the holy
ghost showing and enformynge how man may be helped with grene herbs of the
gardyn and wedys of ye feldys as well as by costly receptes of the potycarys
prepayred. Also it is to be understand that all manner of medicines that be
contrary to sekenesses is for the great superfluyte of the humors or the
dymynucyon of them / or for to restrain ye course where it is against the
feblenesse of the virtues for the alteracyon or solucyon of contynuetes or
wou^des or other begynnynges. etc. It is also to be understand that we find
medycynes simple / laxatyfe / appetisant / and mynysshynge the superhabundance
of humors / and also simple medycynes curra^s and also medycynes alteratytes
and consolydatyfes. etc. This noble work is compyled / composed and auctorysed
by diverse and many noble doctors and expert masters in medycynes / as
Auicenna. Pandecta. Constantinus. Wilhelmus. Platearius. Rabbi moses. Johannes
mesue. Haly. Albertus. Bartholomeus. and more other. etc,

De Aloe. Ca. I.
depiction of plant

ALoe is hot and dry of complexion in the.ii. degree Aloe is made of the ince
of an herb named Aloen. But we call it Cymbre This herb grows in Inde Perse
/ and Poole / And there ben iii. manners of Aloen / Cycotryn / Epatyc and
Cabalyn / And it is made in this manner. The herb is powned and ye Iuce wrong
out / and set on the fire / and when it boyleth it is taken from the fire and
sete in the son to wax thycke / and that is taken vpperest is the most pure
/ and that is Cycotryne / That in the mids is Eparyc / And that in the botom
is Cabalyn / which is course and erthy / a^^ that opynion is false / But we say
that they ben made of.iii. dyfferent herbs / not of kind but in goodness as
of diverse good grapes ben made dyfferent wynes. The best Aloe is the Cycotryne
/ and it is known by the color that is yelowe / drawing to brown / and
specially when it is broken the powdre of it is like powdre of saffron / and
also the substance of it when it is broken in small pyces is clear and subtyle
/ and breketh lightly And also is it known when it stynketh not nor is to
bitter / and sometime is gommy / and sometime bryttyll. The color of Aloe epatyc
is like ye color of liver / drawyng to black / and has holes here and there
like the ends of veins and the substance thereof is deed and vnclere and has
the signs of the Cycotryne / saufe that it is weyker of color. Aloe Cabalyn
is black and dymme / the substance thereof is erthy and very bitter with
horrible stynkynge savor. This Aloe cabalin is sometime made so craftily that
it seems Epatyc or Cycotryne And though in this book we put the craftynesse or
deceyt of medycynes / It is not because we would not that it should be made /
but to eschew ye frawde of them that sells it / and thus it is made
deceytful. It is put in vyneygre with Oryent saffron with a little of a nutmygge
or other sweet smelling spyce / and than broken in peyces very small. And
bound with thredes / and it is put often in vyneygre and than dried / and so
is done x. or.xii times till it changes color and smell and it is styreth so
long that it seems Epatyc or Cycotryne / so yt scantly is any dyffere^ce to
be seen / but it is known in the brekynge / for than it stynkyth / and so
does not the other two. And it is to be known that all thing of his nature
ought to be Aromatyke and of sweet smell / for ye sweter it smells the better
it is. And so all things that in their kyne ought to have any savor ye most
common is best / except Aloe / for how be it that it ought to be bitter of his
nature / yet the less it is by the better it is.

To purge flewmes. A
Aloe has virtue to purge and cleanse flewmes / and humors of melancoly. Also

For the stomach. E
For the same a grain of aloe given with honey cleanses the stomach / and

mouth as far as ye may / and lay.ii. graynes of Aloe deep thereon that it may
be swalowed / and though Aloe be bitter in the mouth / yet it is sweet and
good in the stomach. And therefore it is called Glistonia / that is to say

ALoes is a wood and is hot and dry in the.ii. degree. This wood is found in
a flode of hye Babylone nygh whereby renneth a river of Paradyse terrestre / and
some say that by the swyftnesse of the same river that wood is brought thither.
Other say yt it grows on the hills and deserts before said / and by force
of the wind / and by aege of the trees it falls in that river / and ye
dwellers by ye said river far fro the said hills do cast nets in that
water and take up this wood. There ben.iii. manners of this wood / one is found
in an ylond called Cume / and that is ye best of all. There is in another isle
called Tamear / and is not so good: The other is in an isle called Exanne / and
that is the worst. The first is known because it is heavy full of knottes / and
smells sweet / and has a bitter savor / and the color is black or like
russet. The second kind of Aloes is not so heavy / nor so bitter / nor so well

seruleu^. The tree Aloes is cou^terfayte in the mountains of a country called
Almaphea with a wood or tree named Camelia / like unto lignum Aloes / for it is

be not so noisome to the stomach as nuttes be^. And therefore almondes taken
between new and old / be means between the very sweet and bitter. They
cleanse the fylthe of the body of the lunges / and of the reins / and provoke
vryn / and vnstoppeth the opylacyons of the liver / and therefore the bitter ben

Aqua. Water. Ca. liiii
AQua water / the greeks call it ydro^ / the arabytes call it squi^gihill.
Master ypocras in his ^oke named de aexe / and aqua says that a man ought to
have great concyderacyon of waters that been used in meats and drynkes / such
waters ought to be of good savor light in weight / and clear in color For he
that drynketh troubled and heavy water com^^ly all his body swells fr^ the
heed to the fete / and specially it corrupts the mylte / and makes ill
humors in the body / and therefore when water must he used in any medycyne /
great consyderacyon is to be had if the water be good o^ badde. The masters
say that water is not good to be dronken / and specially to them that been of
cold nature / for water bredeth in them many accydentall sekenesses and flux
in the body / as fevers and many other procedynge of moystenesse. Also women
that been with child and drink water ben delivered with great pain. Women that
drink much water ben many times let of their flowers in their time / and
sometime causes them to run over much / wherefore their bodies ben weyked and
their heedes shake / for drynkyng of water cools the brain. And therefore
master Isaac says that it is impossible for them that drynketh ouermoche
water in their youth to come to ye aege that god has or d^y^ed them. Also
Ipocras says that rain water rotteth lightly / and geteth and noughty sent /
because many waters ben meddled togider above in the air / also the water that
comes of yse or snow is naught / for if water beenes frose^ / or turned to
snow / it will never return into the first nature or kind nor be so clear
as (...) was before. Au^^^n in his fourth (...) cura febrium faith that water
may be given to drink to them that have the cold f^uers. If the fever come of
the galle^ / it behooves to give him one only water in due time when ye fevers
has left him that he neither feleth cold nor hete that is when he tested. If
he be hot or cold give him neither water nor wine for ye fever should be
nourysshed therewith. Aui^en says in ye same book that hot water freseth
sooner than cold / Also he says yt cold water co^sumeth an humor coming
fro the galle named humor coleryke And he says that water nouryssheth not and
that cold water ought not to be given to a seek person / when the humors
cesteth and ben gross and vndygested. Also he says yt man's food can not be
arrayed and dressed without water / and he says that water of sprynges / and
rennynge ryuers be^ best / and the ferder from the spryng the better / and he
says that the waters that been hoote in winter and cold in somer be the best
of all and soden water sonest enters in to the body. And he says in his First
book, feu. in the first doctrine of the xiii. chapter yt water may well be
dronken when the matter is dygested and the nature strong. And he says in the
same book that warm water is good to be used for colyke passion and for
swellynge of ye mylte / and warm water lets the dysgestyon and swageth not
the thyrst. And he says that sta^dynge water and not current noyreth the
stomach. Also he says ye rain water that is gadred in somer wha^ it tho^dreth
and is boystous wether is best to be used in medycyne / and rain water gadred
and kept in other seasons lets ye ^oyce / and stops the breast. Galien
says in the seventh book called Terapentyke in the second chapter says that
cold water Dronken noyeth the body / and provoke inward sickness / and
therefore it is good to be eschewed and also he says i^ ye first bock and first
chapter named. De morte. yt many folk that has bathed them in cold was have
dyed or they came home Diascorides says that water sode^ with barley or malt is

De Balfamo. Bawme tree. Ca. l.
depiction of plant

BAlsamus is an herb as some say but other say that it is a manner of a little
tree / and that is true as Dyascorydes says and other yt have seen it It
grows not past the heyght of two cubytes / and it is found toward Babylon /
in a field where as.vii. wells or fou^taynes be / and is carried from thens /
It bears neither leaves nor flowers / and it is of troth that they do cut or
slytte the tree and rote a little and hang vyoles of glass at them and therein
droppeth the iuce of the said clyftes / and so it is gadred / and so is gadred
every year well.xl. pound of that iuce / the which is called opobalsamum /
the tree is called balsamus / the boughs felled and dried ben called
xilobalsamum. And this fruit can not be kept but iii. years for than it
rotteth And the new and good is called carpobalsamum / and that which is full
of holes is all wasted by aege. The xilobalsamum is kept.ii. years and than
rotteth. And yt which has any gominynesse or slymy wtin when it is broken or
bruised / but if it be long kept though it powdre not yet it is a token yt it
is lost with oldenesse. These two xilobalsamus / and carpobalsamus have virtue
to chaufe and to confort / bistopobalsamus has a mighty virtue / and is hot
and dry in the second degree / but because it is very dear it is
cou^terfayted and fycte in diverse manners. Some sell terbentyne for opobalme /
other terbentyne meddled with a little balsame to cause it have the same smell
and likeness / and so sell it. Other take the iuce of the leaves of lymons /
and of cytrons / and mengle the^ with terbentyne and saffron. Other mengle oil
of Nardyn or Spycke with terbentyne. Some auctours say that ye true is known
fro the countrefayt in this manner. Diascorides says if ye put a drop of
very opobalme in milk it will turn it to cruddes. But there be many other
things that will do so. Other say if a ci^ene thynne lynne^ clothe be wet in
very opobalme / and lets ye clothe be clean washed / and if there be not spot
nor foulness in the clothe it is very good opobalsame If it be pure it is
cytryne or yelowe and it is known fro the countrefayte in this wise / put
water in to a vessel and put opobalsamum in to it and styre ye water with a
stycke or other thing / and if the water trouble not it is very opobalme /
and if it trouble it is countrefayte. Or else put pure water in a clean
vessel of silver or other / and put a certain weight of opobalme in a very
fine clean thynne lynen clothe / and wasshe the clothe in the water and if it
be countrefayte / the good will go to one side as quickesyluer / and the go^me
that it is meddled with / will go to an othersyde / and if it be not
countrefayte ye clothe will not soil / and it will not wast but keep weight as
it was put in / or else not Another probacyon is this. Put opobalsame to the
rofe of your mouth it will chaufe ye brain in such wise that it shall seem as
it would brenne. Some say if it be put in ye palm of the hand that it will
thryll through / but that is not so. It has virtue to consume / to dyssolue /

of stony substance that is found in parties of the sea / and specially in
holowe / and cauy hills that been in ye see / and grows as a manner of a glewy
humor / and cleueth to the stones. The which by the propre heet of the sea is
dried and converted in to substance like to a stone and that which haboundeth
most of the parties of the eleme^t of fire is reed And that which haboundeth
most of parties of water is white coral. The white is colder and not so dry as
the reed. They be both good in medycyne / how be it the white coral ought not
to be taken but it be expressed in ye recept. That is to be chosen that is
smothe / reed and clear / and the reder that it is the better it is. And that
ye is so reed is to be had in medicine to make the face clear / but to put in
medycyne to be taken at the mouth it needs not to have so very clear. It may
be kept as long as a man will without eupayrynge. It has virtue to comfort /
dystreyne / and to cleanse the spyrytes / and has secret propryete against the
falling evil. And some say that the reed coral keeps the house that it is in

dymnesse of the eyes / and wastes the web called pannus / and other
rottenness / and cleanses them / if coral be very small beten to powdre and

eyes. Coral cleanses the tethe if they be robbed therewith / and heleth the
gommes fro all corrupcyons And Galyen says if coral be brent / and given to
drink with cold water it stauncheth blood.

For bledynge at the nose A
Against flux of blood at ye nose put powdre of coral on cotton that is confyct
with iuce of bursa pastoris or cassewede / and make pylles of them and put in
to ye nose.

For bledynge at the mouth. C
Against emoptyke passyo^ / that is wha^ blood comes out at the mouth. and if
this blood come fro the parties of the breast or the members within / it called
spyrytuall members make confeccyon with the two parts of fine powdre of coral
with water of barley or with water that dragaga^t has been sode^ in and make
pyrles / and let the pacyent hold them long upon his tongue one after an
other / and than swalowe them by little and little as they waste / and it is a
general rule that all medicines given against the sekenesses of the members of
the breast ought to be holden long in ye mouth that they may mengle with the
sp^tyll / and made moist and soft by themself / and so little / and little
pass in to the said members. And if the blood at the mouth come fro the
murytyfe members / as the stomach / the liver / and the mylte / give the powdre
with iuce of plantayne. And in this manner it is good also for flux of the belly
or blod caused of the upper bowelles And for the same this powdre taken with a
rere egg is good. But if the flux of the belly be great by vice of the nether
bowelles / mynyster the said powdre and iuce of plantayne with a clystre.

For the matryce D
Against flux of blood that comes of ye matryce / let the powdre of coral be

to the gommes.

For the gommes. F
Against bledynge of the gommes / put powdre of coral / and of anthera that is
the yelowe in the mids of the rose upon the gommes or confyct with honey / and
ye gommes anointed therewith The powdre of coral put in to wounds closes and
re^owdreth them.

De Cepe. Onyon. Ca. C.vii
CEpe domestica / is the common or tame onion. It is hot and dry in ye
third degree / but Auicen says that it is hot in the third degree and moist
in the second / and the substance is glewy styptyke and venymous / and these
condycyons has the long onyon more than the round. And like wise the reed
onyon is more styptyke than ye white and ye white has more vyscosyte than the
reed / and has more raw than soden or roasted. And he says yt if onyons be
often eaten they cause depiction of plant pain and swellyng of the heed. But
Diascorides and many other auctours of physyke says yt it has not so ill
propryetees and be not all of accord in that he says. Onyon eaten causes
great thurst / takes away the ill smake of the mouth / it tendreth the belly
and loses it. The fou^deme^t anointed with iuce of ye blades of onyons dries
emeroydes. Also the iuce of onyon meddled with oil loses the womb if the
foundeme^t be anointed therewith. A master named Esculapius says that ye onyon
conforteth the stomach / causes good appetyte / and bredeth good color.

For bytynge of a mad dog. A
Against bytynge of a dog / beat the onyon with honey and vyneygre / or be
sode^ with honey and wine and laid plaster wise helps much. Diascorides
says if an onyon be brayed with salt and rue / and made a plaster on the
tongue three days or on the belly it loses the belly meruaylously Also the iuce
put in the nosethrylles pourgeth the ill humors that noyeth the heed. Also
this iuce dronken and ordered beneth in cotton causes the flowers retained to
run:

For swollen fete. B
Also onyon beten and laid on fete swollen and hard gives great remedy. Or
let the iuce be meddled with greece of a hen in ma^^er of an oyntement / and
anoynte it often

For the tethe. C
Also who so rubbeth their tethe with an onyon every morning / or holds the
iuc^ in his mouth shall never feel ye pain of t^the ache. Also if it be eaten
with bread it heals the sores / and wounds in the mouth. Also much eating
of onyo^s causes appetyte of sleep. Galyen says that onyons noyeth coleryke
persons / and helps flow matykes. Isaac says yt an onyon is hot in the
fourth degree / and moist in ye third. It has a tarte moystnesse whereby (...)
ingendreth evil humors in ye stomach / and causes thyrst / and bredeth wind
and pain in the heed / and dysposeth to madness for the evil famysshenesse
that mou^teth to the brain. And therefore they that uses it to much comynly
fall in the manyake passion and in the nyghtes so ferfull things in their
sleep and have mela^colyke dremes / and specially it comes to them that have been lately seek and eat or use onyons to much. But if they be used for
medicyns reasonably as they ought to be the cause heet in the body / and makes
it sklendre / lanke / and lene / and dysparseth the glewy humors. They have
virtue to open the ends and extremities of veins / they provoke vryne and the
flowers. The appeaseth thyrst and cause appetyte. Also they rarefye / and open
the outward parties of the skin and thereby cause sweat. They loose ye womb
because their tarte heet / and dryness constrayneth and prycketh nature. They
increase the sede of generacyon by their moystnesse how be it they nourysshynge
is ill who so will that they give good nourysshynge / must fethe them first in
one water than in another / and specially if they be soden with fat flesh in
potage with good and sweet smelling things. Garlyke nouryssheth little and
noyeth coleryke persons / and them that be naturally hot of complexcyon. But
if they that be of cold and moist complexyon do eat them the do provoke vryne
and tempereth the womb. And be clean contrary for them of hot complexyon. But
who so will that they do no harm to any that eats them / sethe them first in
water and than confyct them with vyneygre / and brothe of fat flesh / for
garlyke is good in medicines and prouffytable. For it is good against bytynge of
a wood dog. And who so eats them and drynketh good wine / gives remede
against bytynge of serpent / and for them that have cold sickness it is as
good as tryacle.

De coryandro. Coryandre. Ca. C.xvi.
COriandrum is the herb that bears a sede named coryandre / and is hot and
dry in ye second degree and is a common herb when coryandre is found in
receptes it is meant the seeds. It may be kept two years Coria^dre has virtue
to conforte as well for the qualytees as for the aromatyke and sweet savor.

For dygestyon A
To comfort dygestyon / and against pain of the stomach caused of wyndes.
Take this sede with meats and the wine that it is sode^ in. The powdre of this
sede spread upon flesh that is to be eaten causes it to have a good savor.
Isaac says that coryandre is of diverse natures and virtues / the which is
proved because it has diverse bitter savors / whereby as ypocras says it has
heet / and has also a rauke savor upon eygre or sournesse and therefore it is
said to be cold. And Ipocras says that grene coryandre is hot / and
hardens the womb / and if it be taken after meat it causes sleep.
Dyascorides says that it is cold / and that it deuydeth / and wastes the
kyrnelles called the kyngys evil. The which Galyen reproves in this manner It
is impossible that such kyrnelles should be wasted by things that cools /
for they ben of gross and hard matters. And therefore he holds that coryandre
is hot / for it is very bitter / and ought to be meddled with vineygre or iuce
of pomgarnettes / and so it is good in use of medycyne. The iuce of coryandre
meddled with cerufe / vyneygre / lytargy and oil of roses is good against hot
impostumes and coleryke blysters or pymples / if it be meddled with crommes of
breed / and mele of lentyles. It is good against herysypyle caused of gross
humor. But Galie^ says that these playsters ought not to be laid on such
impostumes at the beginning / for there behooves cold things to appease the
pain / and not dyssoluynge and spredynge.

caules / and somer caules. Those that be somer caules enge^dre blood more
parthed and brent like to black colere caused by way of adustyon / and that is
known by sharpness that they have / and ben mondyfycatyues / and lowse the
womb. They yt ben caules of winter be not so sharp / and the iuce of these
caules lowseth the belly and provoke vryne. The stock of these caules ben
dry / constypatyse and stoppynge When the iuce thereof is dronken it unbinds
ye womb but when it is eaten without the iuce it byndeth. And therefore by cause
the noyaunce thereof be moderated / sethe them first in water and cast that
water away / and sethe them again in other water with very fat flesh of
moten or porke / and confyct them with coryandre peper / and common / and so
let them be eaten The caul called carambia is of the same accyon with other
caules / but it is harder to dygest / and is ill for the eyes and for the terhe
and the parties of the throat and because of the noyenge sharpness it is not
good for medycyne.

Cicer. Achery Ca. C.xxiii.
CIcer is ye herb that bears a sede that called chyches. The sede is to be
noted but not the other part of the herb. Chiches nouryssheth gretely and
moysteth ye womb / provoke vryne purges the flowers in women / but
nevertheless they bread much wind / and that causes swellynge / and it
increases the sede of generacyon / and causes to habounde and styre to
lecheri. There ben two manners of chyches one manner is grene and has not their
full growth. And there ben chyches that have their full growth. And they have
comparyson as dry benes and grene. For the grene chyches ben like in virtue
and operacyon to grene benes and the dry to the dry / but not in all. The dry
chyches ben of two manners / that is to wit white and black. The white ben
hot in ye first degree / and moist in the mids of the same. And howbeit that
their fedinge is more than the benes / yet it is not so good / for they be
hard to dygest and bread wyndes in such manner that they swelle and puff ye
flesh of the body and make an operacyon as leuayn does when it is cast on ye
ground or when it is in paste. And therefore they make the flesh of them
fair that use the^ for the flesh stretche the skin and makes it smothe
and clear. The help that they make to the deed of generacyon is for two causes
one is for they give great quantyte of nourys^hynge and so cause the matter to
habounde. The other is for the ve^tolytees and inflacyons that they cause. Of
them says ypocras. There is in chyches two diverse and contrary virtues. For
when they be sode^ in water they have a swetnesse in taste / and a manner of
faitnesse. By that swetnesse they do cleanse / nourysshe / and increase milk in
the breasts / and is good for them that have ycteryce and dropsy / and sprede
and deuyde the impostumes of the genytoryes / and of the erres behind or
under. For the part that they have salt savor they unbind and sprede gross
humors and ye flowers in women / and is good for them that have the Iau^dis
and dropsy and for ytche of the heed / and of all the body if one be washed in
water that they be soden in

For tetters A

is good also against opylacyon or stoppynge of the liver and of ye galle and
breketh the stones in the reyns and in the bladder. And is very noyfull to
sores and flaynges that be in the reins and bladder. The black chyches ben
hoter and not so dry as the white / and therefore is their bitterness known
that passhed their swetnesse / and they ben better to the sickness above said
/ and specially if they be soden with rape rotes and drink the brothe that
they be soden in / but the white be better for to bread milk in the breasts /
and to increase the sede of generacyon and to provoke vryne because of the
sweetness.

not the cough. For they be but little dyurytyke / and if they be eaten often
they make inflacyon and pain in ye heed / and engendre a close fume in the
stomach / and to the end that these anoyaunces that they make may be put away
and that they may be styptykes they must be roasted that their substance may be
ratefyed / and if they be steped in water they attempre the drythe of the breast
/ and the members within / and divided the humors that lets the vryne by
the souplenesse and moystnesse of the water that they be steped in / and more
over they engendre in ye body good and attemperate humors / but it is good
that coleryke persons ete them with sugre / and the flewmatykes with honey / they
have also conuenable virtues and propryetees for medycynes / for ye put out if

De dyagredium. Ca. C.xli.
depiction of plant

DYagrediu^ is hot and dry in the fourth degree. It is ye iuce of a tree that
grows beyond the sea and is a spece or kind of tytimaluna It is made thus
in the canyculer days. The top of this herb is broken / and therout comes
milk the which is gadred and put in small vessels / and set in the son to
dry / and when it is dry it is called dyagredium. Some say that it is made by
decoccyon. It is cou^trefayt sometime by medlynge of an other kind of tytimall
/ whereby it is of more mighty and excessyfe operacyon / and that which is not
countrefayt and is of more safe and light operacyon. Sometime it is countrefayt
in making by medlynge of ye powdre of colofoni. And sometime among powdre of
dyagredium is sold pyeces of colofony instead of dyagredium.

Dyagrediu^ ought to be chosen yt is white or black / or somewhat black in
color / having a clear or bright substance / and bryttle / and though ye
Colofony be bryttle / it is not so bryttle as dyagrediu^ Good dyagrediu^ ought
to have a bitter savor not to horrible and abominable for tha^ it is
co^trefayt / by putting to milk of an other spece or kind of tytymall / and
that that has no savor is countrefayt meddled with colofoni / that which has
one part bright and the other dymme is to be refused as naught / and it is good
that becomes white as milk as soon as it is meddled with spattyll. That is to
be chosen that is in round wrethes or in small loves and hard. For that that
is in powdre may be countrefayt lightly with powdre of colofony / and it
lasts not so long in powdre as in wrethes. It may be kept.x. or.xx. years.
It is put in compost medicyns to loose to sharp and to force in small quantyte
well and co^uenably / because it is not of to great vyolent savor / or taste /
how be it it is not given alone but ye vyolence thereof is swaged as shall be
said after. For to sharpen medicynes / take two or three dragmes of Squamony or
dyagredium all is one / saufe as masters says when squamony is preparate it
is called dyagredium / and before it is squamony. Take two or three dragmes and
put it to powdre / but not so fine and small as other spyces ought to be. For
if it were powdered so small it would cleue to the guts / by ye vyscosyte
thereof and may be cause of flyxe of the womb Than put these two or three
dragmes so powdered so that there be put thereto as much powdre of Mastyke /
and put it in to ye electuary that thou wylt sharpen and put it while the
electuary is hot by little and little. For if it were put all at ones the one
would cleue to the other / and would not be well meddled with ye electuari Than
put it in hot oil. For by heet thereof the vyolence will abate and waste. And
yet it may not be given sharped with dyagredium to.xv. or.xx. days. Or be it
made thus. Take two or three dragmes of squamony / and stepe it a night in water
that barley was soden in and with ye said water let the medycyne be sharped
and fortyfyed without streynynge / if the pacyent be strong / if he be weyke
streyne it and in this manner may be put more squamony than otherwise / and this
electuary ought to be give.ix. or.x. days. But because ye medicyns behooves to
be sharped and stre^gthed for day to day do in this wise Put two or three
dragmes of squamony in powdre but not to small for the cause before said / and
meddle mastyke with the said powdre and than prepare thy medycyne. Another manner
to sharpen thy medicine and to give it ye same day. Take squamony vnpowdred and
close it past or in a pomme garnet and let it be well baken that the malyod
may waste / and than take it out and powdre it and put mastyke thereto and so
sharpen the medicine. For mastyke is most propre to meddle therewith for to abate
the vyolence / and bedellium is most next / and than gomme arabyke. And it is
to wit that I have said here before that it behooves to take two or three
dragmes of diagrediu^ or squamony / for after diverse regyons and diverse times
or wether / it must be taken more or less / for one dragme does more in a
hot regyon tha^ two in a cold regyo^ and one in hot wether than two in cold
wether.

To purge flewme. A
Diagrediu^ purges coleryke humors flewme / and humor mela^colyke. The
medycyne that squamony or dyagredium is in ought not to be given with cold
water / for by coldenesse of the water it would cleue to the sides of the
stomach / and of it may be made bread or meat laxatyfe.

To make pyment laxatyfe.. A
If thou will make clarey or pyme^t laxatyfe with the other spyces that gooth to
ye said recept in clarey of dyagredium / put powdre of mastyke thereto and put
it in the pan and sethe it / and it will be laxatyfe breed. And how be it yt
dyagredium squamonate purges pryncypally coleryke humors howbeit / it is as
it is put in diverse composycyons. For when it is put in a medycyne called
oxemell laxatyfe or that is called cold electuary / or in that called tryfera
sarasenica it purges coleryke humors. But if it be put in a medycyne called
blanca / or in benedycta it purges flewme. And if it be put in yt called
Theodoricon anacardium / or dyasene / it purges melancoly. And the virtue
thereof lasts most in electuari conficte with honey For it dureth two years /
which it does not if it be confycte with sugre. If squamony be well meddled
with oil of vyolettes it may be used the same day without danger.

De Dragaganto Ca. C.xlii.
DRagagantum is dragagant Of the which is made the electuary that is called
dragagant. It is cold in the second degree and moist in the first. It is ye
go^me of a tree growing beyond the sea. Out the which tree woseth depiction of
plant a moisture that by the heet of the son is thycked / and dried and
turned to a go^my substance. There ben.iii. manners of it. For there is white /
and it is best if it be clear. There is also that is browned / and some
yelowisshe but they be not so good as the white. It is to be chosen that is not
dymme / but clear and none earth meddled therewith / white dragagant ought to be

put dragagant a night therein / and wete clothes therein / and lay to the
apostume at the beginning the same is good against gowte artetyke caused of
hot matters And is like wise good against brenninge if it be laid to the
second day and not the first. For the first day ought to be laid to
brennynges things that been actually hot to put out the heet of the fire and
lay soap to the first day.

For flyx of blood. G
Against blood flyx of the womb / stepe dragagant in rain water / and put
thereto powdre of the same and give it to the pacyent to drink. Or with the
same water warm mynystre a clystre if the cause of the flyx be in the nether
guts / and if it be in the upper guts give iuce of plantayn that dragaga^t
has soked in a night / and when dragagant ought to be put in medycyne it must
first be beaten to powdre by it self / for it is hard to beat / and in
likewise other medicines that been put in electuary of dragagant.

dry places against dyches and pyttes / and has two sorts one is called
daucus creticus because it grows in Crete. The other is called daucus
asininus / because asses and other beestes ette it. Daucus creticus is best but
because it is not much found here / the other is used instead of it. The
most virtue is in the flower and the herb / for ye rote is naught / it ought
to be gadred wha^ it bears flowers. The rote must be cast away / and the herb
hanged in a shadowed place to dry. It keeps good one year. It has virtue to
sprede / to waste and to dymysshe humors by the qualytees / and has virtue

For emorroydes. D
And for ye emorroides co^fyct these powdres with iuce of tapsus barbatus. This
seems against reason that it should staunche blood / for it freteth and wasted
which is a thing contrary as to staunche, we say that the virtue to staunche
comes by artyfyce and craft / because it is brent / for by brennynge the hot
substance thereof is quenched / and so remained cold and dry / and by the
dryness it stauncheth. And it ought to be brent till it be as powdre in this
wise. It is put in a new pot of earth without any lycour upon hot ^re^nynge

much falls in opylacyon of the mylt and liver with hardness and swellynge.
They be noyons to the gommes and tethe / and be of diverse accyons after
dyuersyte of regyons where they grow. For some grow in hot regyons / some in
cold / and some in mean. They that grow in hot regyons ben sweet and gleymy
/ and gives but little nourysshynge and be soon dygested and loses ye
womb; But they that grow in cold regyons abide in their raukenesse / and
rawnesse / because they be less nourysshynge of all ye other / and ben hard
to dygest. How be it they conforth the stomach more than any of the other. They
that grow in mean regyons ben not so hot / but they may be kept long if
they be not gadred or they be ripe. They have superflue lycoure by the which
they fill the body and cause gross humors to habou^de which often be cause of

therefore they bread course and gross humors / and swellynge wyndes and
engendre horrible dremes / and troublous. There be of them white and brown.
and the white ben moyster and less hot / and therefore they be of gross
nourysshynge / and of hard dygestyon and engendre course humors of flewme. And

De faba co^muni. Beans Ca. C.lxxix.
depiction of plant

FAba be common beans. There be diverse manner in kind of cold and heat. For
some be eaten grene / and other dry when they be old and wydred. The grene be
cold and moist in the first degree they bread nourysshynge of very gross and
raw humors / and cause wyndes in the upper parts of the womb / and therefore
they grene the stomach. Dry beans ben cold and dry in ye first degree. They
engendre blood not so ill and nourysshe better tha^ barley for two causes One
cause is / for they be of gross and thycke substance / and abides longer in
ye me^bres. And barley has a swyfte substance and light / and deperted anon
fro the me^bres / and therefore it nourysshe but little The second cause is
because the beans cause many great wyndes the swelle the flesh as leneyn
does the paste. And therefore bredeth fume in the womb that mou^teth in to the
heed and brain and greueth them / and causes many strange dremes And for
because that beans of their nature do bread wyndes. It can not be taken away
by artyfyce or craft of seething nor otherwise. Galyen says that beans used
in meats cause swellynge / and be hard to dygest / but by medycyne they help
to spette out the humors of the breast and longes for they have virtue to
re^ne. And therefore they abide not so long in the stomach as other course
meats do. They have all virtue to cleanse and to scour / for they es^se ye
skin outward if it be washed often with bean meal.

For apostumes. A
If they be laid to apostume of the breasts / or genytorys in manner of a
plaster they will sprede and dyssolue the matter. And all this that we have of
their virtue is in their pyth for the rynde is styptyke and has no rennynge
virtue. And therefore we sethe ye leaves with the ryndes in vyne^gre and give
them to such as have simple flux of the womb by defaute of virtue contentyue
of the bowelles. The beans that be white and thycke and not to old ought to
be taken and be dressed in diverse manners / for they be of diverse accyons. They
may be soden or roasted / they that be sode^ in water be best / for the water
bereueth them much wind and boystousnesse specially if the water be changed
in seething / and this manner of seething may be done in the husks or coddes /
and without them. They that be soden or dressed with the husks or coddes
swells and be hard to digest for the styptycyte and dryenesse of the husks
lets them to avoid lightly out of the belly / and the long abiding there
necessaryly bredeth winds. They that be dressed without the husks swells
not so much and be soon dygested / and if they be dressed with hot things
as peper / gynger / or oil of almondes it is a parfyte medycyne to provoke the
work of lechery. And if they be put in potage with mynte / calament / or common
their wentosyte is lessed. They that be roasted be less wyndy / but they be
hard to dygest. But if they be put in water after that they be roasted / and
eaten with myntes / orygan / and commyn / they less part of their
ventosytees. Dyascorydes says young beans noye the stomach more than the old.

For apostume B
If beans be meddled with meal of fenegreke it helps the apostume that
comes behind ye ears if it be laid thereto playsterwyse.

For the eyes C
If they be bruised or chawed and laid to the temples they let ye humors to
fall in to ye eyes If a bean be parted in two and lay one half of it to the
place that a horsleche has souked it will staunche the blade. They soften the
breasts that be to hard by milk that is crudded in they.

For kyrnelles. D
If the be meddled with glayre of an egg and old oil they dyssolue / and
waste kernelles.

For the foundement. E
For the foundement that comes out a sovereign remedy. Take al black beans
and grynde them very small and sarce the^ well and powdre it on the foundement
and than put it in again. Than sethe the said meal in a pan and meddle it
with white wine / and let it sethe till it be thycke / and tha^ sprede it on a
lynen clothe plaisterwyse and lay it as hot on the foundement as may be
suffered / and remeue it twyse or thryse a day / and renew it always / and ye
shall be hole.

showed by their vyolent moisture. There be two manners of them / one manner is
deedly and flees them that eats of them and be called todestoles / and the
other does not. They that be not deedly have a gross gleymy moisture that is
dysobedyent to nature and dygestyon / and be peryllous and dreadful to eat and
therefore it is good to eschew them / such as eat them and fear not to fall
inconvenience sethe them in water and meddle them with gynger / peper / caruy /
calauant / or orygan and such other / and than drink old wine / pure / and
strong. And they yt be of cold co^plecyon / after them take grene gynger /
dyateryon / pyperyon / socergenne / and reyacle. The deedly mussherons be^ of
diverse accyons after their dyuersyte / and sleeth by their exceeding great
cold and moisture that is in the fourth degree / some slay for by their
gleymynesse cause opylacyon and stoppynge in the veins and pores / and bread
boystous humors that run from one membre to an other / some slay by the evil
qualyte of the place yt they grow in / as by rusti yren / rotten clothe or
wood or nygh the hole that serpents bread in or they that grow by great trees
that have glewmy humors / and frothe. The signs of them that be deedly is a
slymy softness as they were puffed and be of thycke substance / and if they
lie a while broken they will rotte. If any eat them vnwetynge / the best
remedy is to eat peper / or drink nytre with oil / or ashes with vyneygre /
or cocks dyrte or hens dyrte with dyneygre and honey. The decoccyon of calament
/ of orygan of ysope and other like is good and likewise cappres / rue / co^myn
psylle / peper / carui / oil camamyll / and mastyke / for they help gretely.

De Fycu. Fygges Ca. C.lxxxiiii.
depiction of plant

FIcus ben fygges / some call them coryces. There be white and black yasar says
that the fygge is the best fruit of all fruytes and that nouryssheth best /
nevertheless by their moystnes they ingendre gross humors. The fygge is hot
and dry of nature. But there is great diuersyte in ye heet and drythe of
fygges after their diverse natures / for some be wild and some tame. The tame
is in two manners / both grene and dry. Also grene fygges be in two manners.

Some be perfitely ripe and some not: That which is raw and not parfytely
ripe is less hot and more dry because ye erthy parts has most might / and
yet they have hid humors the gives them a sharpness and drythe in the
second degree And Ipocras says that ye longer ye fygge is or it be ripe the
bygger it is and less hot. If they be soden and laid upon kyrnelles and
hard knoppes they dyssolue and sprede them. If they be meddled with nitre and
vineygre they be good for fystula and blaynes in the heed / if they be meddled
with honey they will heal the bytynge of a dog and slimy sores / if they be
meddled with branches of wild popy they draw broken bones out of wounds / if
they be meddled with wax they sprede and waste apostumes. The fygge parfytely
ripe that is yet grene and not dry is hot in the mids of the first degree.
It is composed of three things. The rynde or skin / the sede and the pyth or
meats. The sede is of no more nourysshynge than gravel or stones. The rynde
very dry / and is hard to dygest. The pyth called the meat of ye fygge / is
the nourysshynge part. And Dyascorydes says that they quench superfluous
heat and thyrst and provoke sweat Dry fygges is hot in the beginning of
the second degree and dry in the mydle of the first and therefore the chauffe /
and cause thyrst and turn in to coleryke humors. And nevertheless they be
most nourysshynge of all other fruytes / and swells lest. But if they find
humors in ye stomach they dygest it lightly / and tourneth it to good humors.

and cleanses the body of all ill humors They provoke vryne / and cleanse the
breast and the longues / the reins and the bladder of gross humors / yet
nevertheless they be not exempt fro inflacyo^ and ventosytees / but they bredde
some or little. And who so will eschew that they do no impedement eat them
fasting and after them eat calament / ameos / or genger / or ysope and such
other if ye be of moist complexcyon. But if ye be coleryke eat after them
oxizacra. And if ye have them better nourysshynge / and bread clener blood /
eat fygges with small nuttes or wall nuttes.

For the lungues. A
If they be soden with ysope they cleanse ye longes / and heal the old cough.

For apostumes. B
Gargarysme made with the decoccyon of fygges spredeth and wastes apostumes in
the pypes of the lunges and in the sides of the tongue / if they be soden in
wine and taken in a clyster they appease ache of the womb caused of gross
humors.

If they be soden with gourdes and fenygreke and laid to apostume they loose
and waste it.

that of silver / and there is lytarge that is commely used and that is of tynne

dry in the second degree. But by the words of Dyascorydes it should be
temperate in cold and dryness / and says also lytargie is cold and
styptyke. And yt it is styptyke it appears in that it is dry / and
nevertheless it is te^perate and moderate in his qualytees. And for as much as
the auctores have not determined what excess there is because it is so little
that it is not apperceyuable the lytargye of gold is most cold and moist.

De Lactuca. Letuse. Ca. CC.xxxviii.
depiction of plant

LEtuse is cold and moist i^moderately and the sede is colder than ye herb,
but the auctours tell not in what excess it is. This herb is good to eat and
the sede for medycynes. Letuse is reputed of auctours the most temperate herb
that is / and that bredeth best blood and most causes habou^daunce of milk.
It is a co^uenable meat for coleryke persons if they eat it sode^ or

De Lactuca siluestri. Wild letuse. Ca. CC.xxxix.
depiction of plant

LEectuca siluestris is wild letuse and is much like the tame in figure of
leaves / but yet the stalks or twigs of wild letuse is longer and skle^drer
and sharper / and be not so grene as ye tame because they have less of
moisture. And yt appears in that the wild letuse is bitter and it is more
rauke of humors than the tame / and therefore it is not so cold.

Dyascorides says that a dragme of ye milk of wild letuse meddled with iuce
of the tame and vynegre brings out raw humors.

To cause sleep. A
The milk thereof alone causes sleep / some say yt they have virtue to cause
flowers in women to flow. If they be staunched by their bytternesse. And
though that the tame be cold and moist / nevertheless it is not exceeding. For
if the qualytees had maystry over al / it should have no nature no propryete to
dye as it has. But by the coldness that is attrybued to it that it is good in
medycyne / and in it self by lasting long time / than it is not good for
meat. And ancient men compared it to the water of a standing lake or ponde /
yt which water is hoter than water of rennynge ryuers because of the stone
that shyneth on them / and gooth to the botome and causes the mudde to meddle
with the water. Because letuse is cold and moist moderately it is the best of
all herbs / and engenders good blod and in great quantyte and if it be eaten
vnwasshed it is better. For water increases the cold and moisture thereof.
Letuse is of good dygestyon and provoke vryne / and cease ye pain of the
stomach / of the heed / and the cough caused of coleryke humors / and coleth
ye opylacyon of the blood. It causes sleep and rest if it be laid to the
temples for all the said dyseases. Nevertheless to eat it is more
prouffytable soden than raw. But to increase milk in the breasts and sede of

first degree and dry in the second. And who that will search ferther of their
nature shall find that they be composed of two contrary virtues One in the
rynde / and the other in the pyth For the rynde has a sharpness whereby it
loses the belly / and the pyth is cold and dry and closes and conforteth
the stomach and the bowelles.

generally in what manner so ever they be dressed they make gross or course
nourysshyng and be hard to dygest and engendre me / lancolyke blood. But yet
they be eaten with the ryndes they fill the brain full of mela^colyk smoke
wherbi they be cause much pain in the heed / and cause many falls and ferfull
dremes / and fill the stomach and bowelles with wind / and closes them and
anoyeth them more than any other grain And in like wise they grieve the longues
/ the mydryfe / and the brain / and specially the eyes / for they dry ye
natural moystnesse of them / and be evil and unnatural By their great dries
they restrain the course of ye womb and of flewmes because they thycke the
humors so yt they may not pass through the veins. Also lentylles soden with
their ryndes or husks be contrary to them that be of dry compleccyon / for
they engendre in them sekenesses caused of mela^colike humors as ye black
morfewe / tetters / canker / or lepre called leonine or elefume. But nethelesse
they may profit to them that be of moist conpleccyon / and therefore if they be
eaten with out their husks they be good for the^ that have the dropsy / but they
be noysom with their husks because they bread wyndes and cause the womb to
swell. Lentylles that be gretest be best in medicines / to conforte the virtue
retentyfe and to warm the stomach / and to slake and put out the heat of
course humors that causes flux of the womb. But who that will use them to
conforte the virtue retentyfe / or to eschew flux of the womb caused by
sharpness of coleryke humors / must take away the husks and sethe them in
water / and cast away the first water and sethe them in an other water / and
when they be soden put threto good vyneygre / plantayn / and the leaves and sede
of quynces / and of medlers and other like things. But for to conforte and
warm the stomach / instede of vyneygre take good strong wine and for slack
the belly sethe them with a rache / betes / or gourdes or other things that be
laxatyfe Also lentylles taken in meats as with powdered befe ben of evil
nourysshynge and evil meat. For ye dry flesh yt is cour^ of his nature /
when it is myxt with lentylles doubleth the evil of it / and is cause to
enflambe and brenne / and to bread melancolyke humors. And therefore they be
ill in this manner / specially with the husks But who so will take the vice for
them sethe them in two waters / and in the second meddled vyneygre with mynte /
orygan / common / oil of almondes or of lisanie. Dyascorydes says that a
plaster made of melylot / and celendyne / with oil of roses and lentylles /
wastes the hot apostumes of the eye.

For pymples in the face. D

babylon keep that custom / for there is great quantyte of bawme. And this
Mommye is specially found about the brain / and about the matonge in the
rydge bone. For the blood by reason of the bawme draws to the brain / and
thereabout is chauffed. And like wise is the brain brent / and parched / and
is the quantyte of Mommye / and so the blood is moeued in the rydge of the
back. That Mommye is to be chosen that is bright / black / stynkynge / and

MIrabolanes ben of diverse manners and be cold and dry. They that be yelowe be
cold and dry in the second degree. Mirabolans ben the fruit of trees in Inde
/ also of one shape / but they have diverse kinds and virtues. Of myrabolans
ben good kinds / the citryne yelowe cebules / bellerykes / emblikes / and
yndes Cytrines or yelowe mirabolans that be bygge and heavy / and have a
gommosyte within ben best and may be kept.v. years and the Cebules / and
belerykes ought to have the same condycyon / and the cebules may be kept but.v.
years / but the bellerykes / and emblykes may be kept diverse years. Auctours
say that they purge coleryke humors / but some more and some less Yelowe or
cytryne mirabola^s chyefly purge coleryke humors and secondely flewmes.
Cebules chyefly flewmes and secondely colere: The yndes chyefly mela^colyke and
secondely coleryke The emblykes and the bellerykes purges flewme and coleryke
humors. When mirabolans is found in compost medycynes / the husks only is
to be weyed without the kyrnelles / but when they must be confycte / they must
be well soden and beaten and all weyed together / and the kyrnelles taken away /
and the husks of other mirabolans put thereto / and it needs not to take the
kernelles away / for they be small and may easily be taken fro the husks. It
ought to be known in what quantyte they ought to be taken / and how they must
be dressed. For when mirabola^s citrynes is put in medicines at the most is two
ounces and a half if they be put alone. Put mirabolans in powdre / and stepe it

that all colyces that mirabolans citrynes myxed with ought to be taken at
morrow erly and ye decoction of ye cebules may be taken at eue^ / and they yt

and after yt decoccyo^ of mirabola^s cytri^s ye ought to use some syrope
actuelly cold to drink with cold water / or at the leest cold water if it
be somer / and in winter warm. The other mirabolans may not be given in great
qua^tyte by themself as the cytrines for they be meddled with other laxatyues.
Powdre is made of their kernelles to take away dymnesse of the web in the
eye. Some put the same powdre in rose water / and let them dry two or three
times / and than put the powdre alone in the eye with rose water. Of myrabolans
cebules is a syrope made in this wise. Take cassia fistula / tamarins / and
ma^na and soke them in water and strain them and in ye colyce thereof put sugre
/ and put therein mirabolans cebules / that swells / and this syrope may be
kept.v. years. If it be used it opens the vain that is febled by melancolyke

De Melonibus Melons. Ca. CCC.ii.
depiction of plant

MElons that we call pompous be of two manners. There be some long and some
round. But the round be of courser substance and more gleymy / and that is
seen by their figure / for it sygnyfyeth that humor that they be bredde of
because it was gleymy yt it is egally spredde round about to grow. But the
long ben of more nymble substance / and thynner / because it is put in a
long figure in growing / and that is proved by reason / for ye savor of ye
round is thoucheth somewhat to sweetness. But the savor of the long is
werysshe as water / with a sweetness / which betokens that the substance is
cones or gross / and therefore ye long Pompons / be not so noyfull as the
round. But they have little virtue to cleanse / to wasste and purge. The round
be more noyfull but they have more virtue to cleanse / to wasste and to vnstoppe
/ for if the body is rubbed with them it is cleansed of all fylthe. They ben
both ready to turn to rottenesse / and lightly they change to the qualyte of
humors yt they find in the stomach / whatsoever they be / flumatyke or
coleryke / and therefore they grieve the stomach / and soften ye synewes of the
body / and makes them lethy and make the stomach slyder / and take away the
sharpness thereof. And when they be eaten after other meat by their sokynge in
the stomach / anon and before it be dygested they cause wind and wryngyng in
the womb and bowelles / and sometime provoke vomyte and wambelyng and causes
ill appetyte. And therefore who that will use them eat them fasting / and take
none other meats till ye think them dygested And in this manner they dygest
well and cause good humors though they be flumatyke. And other wise they bread
ill humors and cause strong fevers / and specially to them that be dry and
hot of kind / that because the te^dernesse of their substance yt change
light to coleryke humors. The rote of ye herb and also ye melons be not so
cold as the pyth of ye fruit And wha^ they be dried they become dry to the
end of the second degree / and therefore they be more slypper / and vnstoppyng
the veins and conduytes tha^ the fruit. The seeds provoke vryne and causes
to pysse / and cleanses ye reins and the bladder of gravel and stones. But
the virtue is more in work of the reins tha^ of the bladder / because the
grauel and stones of the reins be soft / and of the bladder hard / and
therefore behooves harder medicines to the bladder than to the reins.

To provoke vomyte. A
Two dragmes of the powdre of ye rote provoke vomyte.

For heat in the stomach. B
Melons Pal^stynes that we call sarazyns Melons / have less moisture than ye
other / and resysteth more to turn in to corrupcyons / and therefore they be

their coursnesse and cold abateth heat of the fever.

moeue lechery and cause good blod^ But the auctour says yt cough / encresynge
and haboundau^ce of lecery comes by moystnesse yet it may come by heet and
dryness / for by the dryness ye blood is made subtyle / and sharp / and by
ye heet it is made warm / therefore it is not to be denied that ye said nuttes
be hot and dry. But wha^ they be^ put in medicines the shales must be cast
away and the kernelles put in. and they may be kept.x. years. Against lettynge
of brethe caused of cold / sethe fat fygges in wine and beat the^ / and
wrynge out the brothe and strain it / and with the iuce take ye powdre of
nuttes of Inde.

depiction of plant

NVttes stiatikes be hot and dyre in ye second degree. They be a manner of
nuttes that grows beyond the sea / and be of the bygnesse of a comune nutte
/ and have reed graynes or seeds in them yt have a sharp savor as peper. They
have virtue to chaufe / to dry / and to conforte.

To conforte dygestyon: A
To conforte dygestyon make powdre of these nuttes with gynger / and rynamum /
and put it in your meats.

Against rewme or humors yt falls in to the gummes caused of cold. Beat
the graynes of these nuttes with mastyke and hold it in the mouth and it will
cause to avoid much humors.

De nuce co^muni. Wall nuttes Ca. CCC.x.
THe wall nuttes ben of two manners for some be dry and some be grene The grene
be not so hot as the dry / and have a certain moisture because they be
depiction of plant not perfytely ripe / and therefore they be but of a small
drythe / and be somewhat grievous to the stomach. If they be eaten grene with
wynegre / and a confeccyon made of breed and salt fysshe called obsomogarus
they keep the womb moist*

For venym. A
They ought to be eaten against venym with rue. The dry nuttes be of.iii.
manners or sorts. For some there be newly gadred / and some old gadred / and
some mean between both. The new gadred be moist in co^paryson of ye other /
and have a little gleyuynesse / and be wyndy and be somewhat styptyke. But the
older they be ye more they lose the moystnesse that they had and habounde in
fatness of oil / and therefore if they be eaten they ben sone turned in to
coleryke humors. But they that be very old have so much of that fatness yt
their savor is like old oil / and therefore they be not good in meats. They
that be mean be grievous also to the body and stomach / and be hard to dygest
/ and specially of the^ yt be hot and dry and coleryke and be contrary to
the^ yt have ye cough caused of heat. And if we compare hasyll nuttes to wall
nuttes we shall find the wall nuttes of better fedynge / because they have a
steadfast substance and be not so fat and oily / and ye nuttes be agaynwarde
/ and therefore they nourysshe less and be always grievous / and contrary to
the synewes of the stomach / if they find not the stomach well tempered or
that it have such coldenesse as may abate the heat of the nuttes / and in
such a stomach they be of good fodynge and dygestyon / and in a hot stomach
they brenne / parche / and turn the humors in to coleryke and cause fume
that asce^deth in to the heed and eyes and troubles the brain and sight But
to delay their malice they must be powned in a mortar and laid all night in
warm water yt they may have moisture thereof / and so they do become like to ye
grene nuttes. They be good in medicines / for if they be eaten before other
meats with fygges they keep the body fro all venymous things.

De Oliua. Olyues. Ca. CCC.xxiij.
depiction of plant

OLyues ben of two sorts / ye wild and the tame. The tame be of.iiij. sorts
Some be grene and be somewhat eygre of savor / and some be partly ripe / and
be black / and there be between grene and ripe / and be reed. Diascorides
calls ye grene olyues Iacinctures / which some aquatyke or watery because
they have but little oil / and be of two manners. For one is called proprely
aquatike / and the other vnproprely. They that be proprely called aquatike or
watery ben erthy and have in manner none oil / but a clear iuce as water / and
be cold and dry and more confortable to the stomach than any of the other.
They bind the womb and nourysshe less than any of the other / and be of
hard dygestyon. The other be kept with vyneygre / and get a sharpness and
drythe and therefore they cause the blood to flambe and grieve the synewes of the
stomach / and be hard to dygest / and be more subtyle and thynner of
melancolyke humors / and conforteth the appetyte if they be taken in the
myddle of dinner. They that been proprely called aquatyke ben they that though
they grene yet of the^ comes an oil yt is called oliu^ omphaciu^ / and they
be more nourysshynge tha^ ye other aforesaid / and also they comfort the
stomach less because of their oil. They that be black and ripe co^pete^tly
be hot / but they be mean between moist and dry / and Diascorides says that
they have some dryness / and Galien says yt they be moist and nouryssheth
well and soften ye stomach and dygest and come lightly out of ye body for their
fatness causes them to sw^mme in ye stomach / but by their oil they loose /
souple / and anoynte ye stomach or they be dygested / and therefore they be not
so wholesome as ye grene. For they bread ill blood They that be mean be less
grievous tha^ ye black because they have less oil / and somewhat conforte the
stomach. But all the olyues after the color that they have bread humors of
like color. Galyen says that reed olyues that be not ripe ben sone moeued in
to corrupcyon / and soften the stomach and moist the womb. Ripe olyues be good
for medicines. For if they be broken and laid to brent or scalded places they
delay the bladders / and blysters of the same.

De olio oliuarum. Oil of olyues. Ca. CCC.xxiiij.
three barrels lying on their sides; two cauldrons in background

Oil of olyues is of diverse manners. For one is newly pressed out / and ye
^ther old. That yt is newly pressed out is of ^^rype olyues / and is called
oil omphacium how be it good oil known by the good savor / and oil
omphacium ought to be sharp poynau^t and eygre in the mouth And the grene that
the olyues be that it is made of / the colder and dryer is the oil and
conforteth the stomach. Old men compared this oil to oil of roses New oil
of black olyues perfytely ripe is hot and moist temperately / and softened
the stomach and moysteth the womb / and tourneth lightly to coleryke humors.
But oil that of long time is pressed of olyues if it be made of unripe olyues
has none ylnesse but it be somewhat eygre. But if it have none / it is ill /
and turn anon to evil humors and softeneth the stomach But yet it lets
not dygestyon. And if it be old and the savor thereof is sharp it is not good
to eat.

them / Then take a cruse and fill it full of oily olyue / and put the three
beten eggs therein and beat them all together without salt / and than take
white cassie well cle^sed / and sethe ye eggs therein without any oil or
grease / and styre it always a pace till they be well soden / and when all is
well soden together eat ye better half / and lay the other half on ye wound
as hot as may be suffered / and ye shall be hole / and ye must fast.iij.

depiction of plant

OLeandre or olipantru^ is an herb the leaves thereof is like to laurel but
they be longer. It growed in manner of a tree about flodes / and has a venymous
virtue. Therefore let every one beware fro ratynge thereof. some noughty
persons make broches or spetes thereof and roste meat on them / and so
venymeth the meat and causes them to dye that eat thereof / and therefore it
is need bewarde and utterly eschew it.

This herb has virtue against salt flewme that causes scabbed leg / if it
be sode^ in water and the legs washed therwt morning and evening.

For the back and tallockes: B
It is good for pain of ye back and swellynge of the coddes if it be laid

not wha^ it is broken / and has a sharpness that is not soon felt / but it
be chawed in ye mouth It has virtue to withdraw / deuyde / and waste humors.
Gargarysme made of vyneygre that pyreter is sode^ in with fygues / or made in
sweet wine purges ye heed of flewmatyke humors / and wastes the moistness
of the dygge / and if it be chawed between the tethe it swageth the ache. If it
be stamped and meddled with wine and oil / and laid to a gowte playsterwyse /
or on any paralytyke it is good membre. Grene pyreter beten and laid
afortenyght in wine / and than sode^ and streined / and with oil and wax an
oyntement made is good for ye above said things.

PEper is hot in the beginning of the fourth degree / and dry in ye mids
of the same. There is three sorts of it For there is long peper / yt is called
macro pyper And there is white peper yt is called malano piper. Some say that
they be fruit of diverse trees. But Constantyne and Dyascorides say that they
be all three of a tree growing in ynde / and some say that peper is made so
black by brennynge. For when it should be gadred for ye great multitude of
serpe^tes thereabout / they set fire about the trees yt the vermyn may be brent
and go away. But if that were true the trees should be bre^t. And therefore
this auctour says yt they ben fruit all of one tree but when it bears
flowers / those flowers gadre on a hepe and stretches alonge as the flower of
hasyll and that is long peper / and than it bears an other manner of little
fruit yt is called white peper and thereof have we none. But instead of it is
put catapuce or spourge of beyond the sea / which is no peper / for it is
bygger and is not sharp as peper. And if it be put in medycyne the substance
wtin must be taken and not the husks Black peper is gadred when it is ripe /
and the sarazyns bake it in an oven for two causes. The first to keep it long
/ and the second that it bear no fruit nor grow in other countries / and the
black peper is of more virtue tha^ ye white or long peper / and it may be
kept.xl. years. The white yt we have not may be kept long enough / and the
long peper.xx. years Black peper has virtue to sprede / and deuyde humors.

TRiticum is wheat it is hot in the first degree and is mean between hot and
moist / and the breed that is made thereof is more hot than moist / for ye

moist in the second degree / and nevertheless their seeds become dry in the
son. Barley and beans ben dry of their nature / but in the seething in water
they become moist. Than sith it is so ye dry things receive moisture by water
and moist things drythe by the son / it may be said that hot things ben
coled by snewe / and cold things hette by fire. Among all graynes and seeds
wheat has the propryete to nourisshe best by likeness that it has to the
complexyo^ of mankind and therewith it has other propryetees for medycynes /

wheat is better than of barley.

Against cough and flux of blood of the breast soden with oil and laid on
hard apostumes it softeneth them and spredeth the matter. If the meal of
wheat be meddled with vyneygre and honey and laid ^n pymples of the face it
cleanses them.

For breasts B
If it be meddled with rue and soden in water and laid to hard breasts that be
crudded with milk it will soften them.

For broken synewes. C
If it be meddled with iuce of hanebane and laid playsterwyse to broken synewes
it will keep them yt no grievous humors come to the^. Grain of wheat chawed
is good for the impostume that comes of bytynge of a mad dog. Oil made of
the grain of wheat is good for tetters / and ryngwormes / but the place must
be first well rubbed with a coure lynnen clothe. Iuce or brothe made of ye
wheat meal or dust that flees about ye myll is good for the^ that spette
blood called emoptoyke passion. The branne of wheat is hoter and dryer of
kind than the meal / and is of little nourysshyng but it is clensynge. If it
be steped in water / and rubbed between ye hands and than streyned and meat
like pappe made thereof it will cleanse ye longues and ye breast of course humors /
and if milk be put in the said meat it is more nourysshynge / and sooner
auoyeth the stomach. If it be soden in wine and laid playsterwyse to breasts
that be hardened with (...) it will mollyfy them and the same is good against
bytyng of a serpent. New wheat is of little nourysshynge and tourneth anon
to rotte^nesse and to raw flumatyke humors / and bredeth worms in the beli
But if it be baken it nourissheth more and causes less wind / and if it be
soden in water it is hard to dygest / and swells specially if there be much
meal and litel branne. But when it may be well dygested it nouryssheth gretely
and conforteth and ysueth late of the belly / and it ought to be given to
laborers.

De Vua. A. grape. Ca. CCCC.lxix.
depiction of plant

VVa a grape / or a raysyn is in two manners / that is the grene or eygre and ye
ripe full of sweetness / and that ought to be called the grape. That that is
eygre is cold in the third degree / and dry in ye second. It has three
diverse substance. That is to wit the husk / the kyrnelles / and the humor
within. The kernelles be so hard and dry that nothing of them conuerteth to
the substance of man / and come all hole out of the dygestyon.

But if they be broken or made in powdre and eaten they conforte the stomach /
and restreyneth the body of colyke / and specially if they be roasted. The husk
is hard also and tough* and can not torn to the nature of ye body / and
therefore it nouryssheth not. The humor for the sharp soreness is ill to
dygest / but yet it comforts the stomach / and quenches the heet of the
liver and swage thyrste / and refreyneth and lesseth the brennynge of coleryke
humors and stauncheth coleryke vomyte / caused of defaute that comes of the
virtue retentyfe of the stomach or liver. And if it be put in the eyes it
softeneth and tendreth ye course humors of the stones and mores / and is good
against ytchynge and pryckynge of them. Dyascorides ordained to put grapes in
the son to wax eygre before the canyculer days / so long that they waxed
thycke as honey. And this iuce so thycked is good for the humors yt fall in to
ye throat and gomes / and to the ears. If clyster be done with it / it is good
against blody flux of the womb / and against humors that fall in to the
matryce. Vua matura / the ripe grape engenders good blood as the fygge does
that is one of the best fruytes that is. But the fygge nouryssheth more. The
ripe grape is composed of.iiij. diverse substaunces. The kernel is cold and
dry and is of styptyke virtue as the kernel of the unripe grape. but it has a
manner of sharpness that causes it to issue anon out of the stomach or it be
soon dygested. Also the husk is cold and dry and tough to dygest. And
Galyen says that the husks of ye grape and of ye fygge be like in dygestyon.
And therefore if the grape be eaten with the husk and kernelles it hardens
the womb and causes wyndes / and swel lynges. For they bread humors far
from nature and blood. Also Galyen says that fygges and grapes ben the best of
all fruytes / for they be not of hard dygestyon / and specially if they be
left to ripe perfytely on the tree / and that is proved because the laborers
in their seasons almoost use the^ a lovely for their meats / and were fat
cryspe / and clean of their flesh. And wha^ fygges and grapes be out of
season and fail them anon they were lene / and lose their fatness that they
had gotten before. And because that the flesh caused of fygges and grapes is
more foggy than fast and steadfast / some eat grapes in one manner / and some
in another. Some eat them as soon as they come from the vine / and some do
hang them in the air till they have lost some of their moystnesse. Other
wha^ they be gadred put them in must or sode^ wine They that be eaten as soon as they be taken from the vine / if they find the stomach empty as well of
humors as of other meat. If the stomach be strong in dygestyon the convert
in to good blood / and helps to unbind the womb / and to purge the body of
evil humors. And if they find the stomach full of humors or other meats /
or feeble of dygestion they abide long and cause swellyng and wind / and torn
in to noughty humors / and bread great quantyte of fumes / and flux of the
womb They that be hanged in the air till they be purged of superflue humors
/ among grapes ben the best / and be of most subtyl nourysshynge / and neither
cause wyndes nor fumes. They that be kept in must or soden wine be though to
dygest / and be lest behouefull to the stomach / and torn to course humors /
and cause inflacyo^ and fumes because of strounge humors that they take in the
must and soden wine. There be grapes that have no thycke substance of meet in
them / but only clear and thynne lycoure. Other have much substance and
meat. They that have no thycke substance bread more kyndly humors than they
that have. But they nourysshe less. And therefore the grapes that have most
thycke substance nouryssheth most but they be harder to dygest. The dyuersyte
of grapes is yet better praised in other manners / by their savors / their
bygnesse and their color. The savor of grapes may be watery / or like smell
of eldres as gross sweet weryssheuesse / or sauored like honey / or mean as
taste of wine only The grape that has a gross sweet savor is of gross /
and werysshe nourysshynge and hot / and causes thyrste / and is hard to
dygest / and caused wind and hurlynge in the belly / and stops the liver and
the mylte. The grape that has a subtyle watery savor is colder / and of
lyghter dygestyon / and conforteth the stomach / and cle^seth coleryke humors
/ and swageth thyrst. And the most te^perate grapes to the body is they that
have a mean savor. For as they have a mean savor / so they have mean
operacyons.

The dyuersytees of colors in grapes is.iiij. for some be white and clear /
and watery with small substance of thyckenesse thynne husks / and small
kernelles. There be that have black color and thycke substance / and bygge
kernelles. Some be of a dymme brown color / mean between white and black.
The white be of light nourysshynge / and light dygestyon / and thyrleth all the
veins / and provoke vryne. They that be black be hard to dygest but they
conforte ye stomach / and provoke none vryne / and if they be well dygested
they nourysshe well and much. They that be brown mean between white and
black / and be mean also in operacyon between the^ both. And Arystotle says
that the white and subtyle grape nouryssheth leest. But it is soonest dygested
by dronke^nesse that it causes / and so is not the black because it is
thycker. The dronke^nesse of the brown and cytryne be mean / and it is a
general rule that of all wynes that drunkenness comes lightly / in like wise
it gooth lightly. And if drunkenness be long in coming it is long in goyuge.

De vite allba. Ca. CCCC.lxx.
VItis alba is a wede yt spredeth on hedges in heyght and qualyte. Here shall
no more be spoken of it for there is enough spoken of it in the chapter of
vite cella / that is all one.

mollum terre. It grows in vnlabored places and in hills / and is in manner of
a tuberosyte or exerescence / as it were hethe or shrubbes the which the
bygger they be the better they are. The rote thereof has great virtue dry and
grene / but the grene is ye best. And it ought to be gadred in the end of
septembre / and cloue^ in quarters / and hanged on thredes / in shadow places
/ or a little in the son. It may be kept three years. It has virtue to louse
or unbind.

For emorroydes. A
For emorroydes swollen and not rennyng apperynge out lay the powdre thereof on
them the powdre of black elebore / and dry roses. Or else make a clystre or
supposytory with the said powdres / or blow it thereon in this manner / put the
powdre at ye end of a quyll or read / and bind a bladder at the other end
full of wynd / and blow it in so upon the sores. A certain woman of Salerne
proved that it is good for the byte of the fou^deme^t called ficus or
emorroydes.

but the mollyfycatyues ought to be before / and than anoint it with this / or
do it with the iuce / or with the powdre with wax and oil. This has been proved
of times. The woman of salerne gadre vulfago the last thursday of ye wane of ye
moon and lay it to the mylte / and they cleue it in three parts with an axe
upon ye thressholde of the pacyentes door / demaundyng him what sekest thou /
the pacyent answers / my mylte / and than they hang it in ye smoke saying
this wise. As the parties of vulfago dries so dries ye mylte of this man Tha^
they anoynte the mylte with the oyntement aforesaid.

For apostume. F
Against apostume of cold matter / that can not break for ye thyckenesse of ye
skin Stamp vulfago and sethe it in oil and lay it hoote thereon and it will
purge it inward or outward.

For fystula. G

they both have long seeds and a long and a thynne rote / and is very dry of
complexyo^ and shall be used to flowynge and moysty wounds and to old
vlcerarye and sores.

Against the chynke cough and the yelowe iaundys. A
This rote dronken with wine is good against the iaundys / and helps much
against chinke cough: Verbena stamped and laid on the wounds playsterwyse
heleth and dries the wounds anon.

The iuce dronken with wine dryueth away all the imposenynge from the body. The
leaves and the rote soden in wine and dronken is good against the fever tercyan
A dragme of those leaves laid in wine the time of.iiij. days and than holden

De Vua versa. Ca. CCCC.lxxv.
depiction of plant

VVa versa is cold and moynst in ye second degree / and ye herb and the rote
may be used in medicyns. And is good for them that has great hete without and
within the body / but it causes melancoly and therefore the melancolyce and
other persons that been cold and moysty of co^plexyon must take heed for to
use the herb or rote. Women that eat or drink of this herb gets the
sekeness^ named manya yt is a manner of a frenesy. Therefore women that has a
cold and moysty brain must pryncypally take heed for it / for it causes more
coldenesse and moystenesse.

De xilocratbius. Ca. CCCC.lxxvi.
XIlocrates be small fruytes yt grows nowhere but sury and have a sweetness
meddled with stypticite. And their substance is hard in manner of wood and of
evil dygestyon. But when they be grene they be laxatyfe and grieve the stomach
but the dry ones do less grefe. And the cause that ye grene be laxatyfe and
not the dry / is because the moystnesse of them is sharp / the which
moystnesse dries and their substance waxes erthy in manner of wood / and
causes the body to bind and to provoke vryne. But they have a great malice /
for they abide to long in the stomach / wherefore if they be custumably eaten
they engendre colyke passion. And Galyen says. I would ye xilocrates should
never come out of sury. For in the country that the grow they be laxatyfe /
and wha^ they come here they bind and grieve the body. Probatumest.

De zinzibre. Gynger. Ca. CCCC.lxxvij
ZInziber is gynger. It is hot in the third degree / and moist in ye first.

troth is that it is a rote of a tree growing in Slauony. The wine that it is
soden in with fygues and great reysyns is good against cough causes of cold /
and against coldness of the breast. Powdre of gynger put in fygges is good for
the same

For the stomach. A

For the heart. C
The said powdres put in meats is good against weykenesse of the heart and
swownynge. It may be kept two years. And it keeps better with peper tha^ other
wise. There be two manners of gynger. One is wild and another tame. The wild
is brown and has a right sharp taste and is very styffe and hard. The tame
is white and is not so sharp and pryckynge and is not so hard. And when it is

hot in the beginning of the first degree and moist in the mids. And says yt
it wastes coleryke humors because it unbinds the womb And the laxyng that
it makes is without rottenness / or brennynge / because it moysteth the
womb. How be it if it be given to them that be of coleryke complexyon / it
changes in them to hot coleryke humors for the sweetness thereof. For as
sour things delayeth the sharpness of coleryke humors / so sweet things
that have contrary savor and eygre nouryssheth and increases colere. These be
the saynges of Isaac of sugre. The said auctour says that sugre is hot and
moist te^peratly in the first degree. It has virtue to cool / to moist / to
nourysshe / and to soften. If two pound of sugre be put in syropes or drynkes
there must be a pound of water / and if more be put it forces not but that it
must sethe the longer to waste the water. The sugre is made of cannes in manner
of boll rysshes / which is full of sweet pyth / and it is called the honey
ca^ne It grows in spain and cycylle. And sugre is made at mydsomer in this
manner. The people of that country take these cannes or boll rysshes / whithe be
like redes / but that redes is holowe within / and these cannes be styffe and
full of sweet pyth. They cut them in small pyeces / and stamp them and sethe
them with a sokyn fire in a cowdron till it wexeth thycke / and is clean
sco^med. and of ye said sco^me ye noughty conutrefayte sugre is made / for it
is lyghter than the good / and is full of holes and pyttes within. And therefore
when so will choose a sugre lofe / cleue it in the mids / and if ye find it
full of hooles / and pyttes within and that the taste be not very sweet / and
that it crasshe not between the tethe it is not right sugre / but is
countrefayte. Of the grounds of the cowdron / and that is thycke when the
water is soden the which when it is almoost cold is put in round vessels
and set in the son / with the heat of the son / and of the seething it
wexeth white and hard and that is the best. Sugre may be kept.v. years i^ a
place not to dry nor to moist. Sugre is put in many medicines and confyetures /
and specially in them that be made for sharp dyseases / and cheyfly that whice
is whytest / is the coldest. There is reed sugre and it is very hot / and is
called sugre mellum / and it is so reed for fault of perfyte / and good
seething / and is made by water that is cast thereon / and is put in pottes when
it is of the fire. This reed sugre ought not to be put in medicines for fevers
ague. But if it be soden with vyneygre till it be parched and put in
supposytory of fever ague. Sugre is good for them that be dry by ye way. It
is good for them that be leued with sickness / and that be short brethed by
drythe of the breast / and it ought for to be put in their drynkes nor meats
for it will cause them to gadre flesh and keep them moist.

Ynguirialis. Ca. CCCCC.iij.
YNguirialis is an herb yt grows in stony rotches and hard earth / and has
stars which shine so bright / that many persons think that it were of the
deuylles works. Galien says Some call it herb of todes / or depiction of
plant herb of rattes / for it is a great medycyne for the todes and wild
rattes / and is called in latin Bubonium. And some ro^es and wild rattes ben
dwelling on the stony rotches and other places where this herb grows /
because when a tode is hurt of a spyner than she swells so thycke / that she
does think to barste and dye / tha^ she fetches of this herb and heals
again And when a wild ratte is hurt so sorry that she may not get ye herb
by himself than another ratte fetches it / and brings to the seek ratte /
and she takes in his mouth and is hole thereof. And more other venymous bestes
ben preserved and hole by this herb.

Scamonea. Ca. CCCCC.v.
depiction of plant

SCamonea latin and arabic^ ^yagridion greece. Serapio says it is a tree with
many branches growing of one rote / and on the branches is hangyng a slymy
water like gomme. The leaves of it is three square / and bears white round
flowers / holowe like pypes / having a strong odor. This tree has a white
rote / bygge as a thombe / and has also a strong odor. The rote is full of
milk / and milk is gadred thus. The rynde of the rote is cut or wounded with
sharp knyues or other instruments / and round about is made a holl in the
earth and there be set diverse vesseles / wherein the milk dystylleth or
droppeth / and than it is taken and keep / and this lyquour is dried / and it
is named scamonea. The best scamonea is clear and soft slybbery like the matter
that is pured of an oxces skin. It is like a spounge / and is gadred in Inde
and Asye in an isle of Inde named Musie / there grows it in great quantyte.
Scamony is often contrefayted with milk of ye herb of catapucie it used
kylleth a man or woman. Some takes the milk of the herb of catapucie meddled
with barley meal and make it like scamonea / but that is not good and shall not
be used in medycynes. Some masters says scamonea coming out of Senisz or
Palestyna is not good / for that is made and myxted of barley meal / and milk
of tintinall. Galienus and master Paulus says Scamonea is hot and dry
almoost in ye third degree. Scamonea shall be prepares first or it be used i^
medicines because scamonea of his nature is peryllous to use and does great
hurt to the stomach and liver / and takes from a man his appetyte to eat /
causynge great harm in the body And therefore scamonea must be rertyfyeth in
the manner following. The masters says / scamonea reteyneth his ill qualites
the time of.xxx. or.xl. years or more / but when it is rectyfyed it leseth the
euylnesse causynge not so great harm. Therefore it shall be rectyfyed or it be
used in medicines and not with his propre qualytees / for it causes and
brengeth many dyseases / as cold sweat / swymelyng / fayntnesses / or other
fluxus in the body / and at ye last to dye.

For rectefye the scamonea.
Take a quynce apple and cut of the upper paring / and than make therein a hole
and put therein scamonea / than lay the cuttyng part or coueryng again on ye
apple and close them in dought and put it so in an oven / which is temperatly
hot / and let it than abide therein half a day / and the scamonea shall be
prepared in the apple / and his ylnesse taken away / and it shall do after that
no harm.

For to know scamonea.
The best scamonea is to be known by ye propretees following. The first that
clear is of color. The second when it is mydled with spettell and become like
milk / than it is good / if it be not so it is falsed and co^trefayted. The
third when it lightly breketh and powdreth. The fourth wha^ it is light of
weight. The.v. wha^ it smells well. The scamonea having not these propryetees
is not good / and it may be kept xx. years unconsumed in his virtue and
operacyons. Master Paulus says scamonea is strong and sharp of operacyon /
co^sumynge the color / and has virtue attractyfe. Scamonea is contrary to ye
heart taking all his strength / and causes comenly the fevers to them that
is hot and dry of nature. The masters forbede the^ that will use scamonea /
for geete hot / and great cold.

For purgacyon. A
Scamonea used with the iuce of quynce apples and iuce of plantago purges
softely / purgynge therewith ye ill humors. Seamonea shall never be used alone
/ but mastyke therewith / and than takes the body no harm.

For pain in the heed. B
The heed anointed with scamonea meddled with vyneygre / and oil of roses /
takes away the pain in the heed.

For ill scabbes. C
The ill scabbes anointed with scamonea meddled with vyneygre cures / heals
and dries it maruaylously.

Here after follows the knowledge of ye dyuersytees and colors of all manner of
vrynes through the which the Phycysyens mynystre or cause to be mynystred all
manner of medycynes to the vtyll and profitable health of man. two standing
figures, one holding a flask containing liquid and pointing at it
AVice^na records in the first part of his.iiij. book / where as he writes
that it is not possible for to ease nor help no manner of person with out
natural knoulege of the disease or infyrmyte of man / which as many noble
doctors does us infourme that it is perfectely known by the sight of vryne
and by the four complexyon of man as here after follows. When ye vryne is
reed and thycke / that sygnyfyeth on to us that the seek body or pacyent is
hot and full of blood / and of his complexyo^s is named sanguyne.

When ehe vryne is reed and thynne tha^ is the seek body hot and dry / and of
his co^yleryon named coleryke / and comynly his dys^ases comes out of the
galle / and this person is sone vexed unto anger / and begets comenly the
yelowe Iaundys. When the vryne is white and thycke ye betokens on to us that
the seek body is ^olde and moist of nature / and is named flewmatyke and his
disease comes of diverse watery humors / and this man is comenly and often
gladly alone.

When the vryne is white and thynne that betokens on to us that ye body shall
be cold and dry of nature / and is named melancolyke / and he is always heavy /
and has in him heavy blood of the nature of earth / and is comynly pale of
color.

NOta The vrynes is divided in.iiij parts The first part is the cercle upon
the vppermoost ring of the vryne which sygnyfyed great pain in the heed The
second part of the vryne is the next part under this cercle / and that
sygnyfyeth the disease in the breast and longues. The third part of the vryne
is in ye myddest / and betokens disease in the stomach / liver / and mylte.
The fourth part is the bothom of the vryne / betokenynge to us the disease in
the kydnes / in ye guts bladder / and matryce or mother. When ye find any of
these four vrynes myxted with any other matters according to the same ye shall
know the disease of the person / through the which ye shall judge ye vrynes
which vryne ought to be seen in the morning when it is fresshe or warm. And
these vrynes shall be put in an vrynall and well stopped because it should not
deuyde or wax thycke / for than it ouhgt again to be warmed to have his
natural sight according to the fornamed colors.

THe vrynes be divided in.xx. pertes or more The first color is white and
clear subtle as water. Another is white and thycke as thick milk. Another
like milk new molke^. Another like color of gynger or a camels hyde this
color is named caropos. and these four colors betokens a neuyll stomach
without dysgeysto^ The vryne yt is pale of ye color of flessh half sode^ / and
ye vryne yt is pale like flesh yt is hole sode^ betokens a good beghynnyng
of dysgestyon not fulbrought.

The vryne that is yelow like an onrype apple betokenth ye beginning of
dysgestyon fulbrought.

The vryne yt is hole yelowe like a ripe apple betokens a parfecte dysgestyon
and also sygnyfyeth ye reed vryne like on pure gold and also like pure gold a
perfect and good dysgestyon ye vryne yt is of color like watery blood or
saffran or like a fla^me of fire. These four vrynes betokens excess of
dysgestyo^ in ye stomach in a hot body and in a seek body it betokens feners
or axces and hete of ye liver The vryne yt is like thycke reed wine or reed
earth inclyned to heaviness betokens a bourned moisture. The vryne of ye
color of leed or ashes betokens a deedly moisture or sickness. The vryne
that is grene or of the color of colewort betokens a deedly sickness and
moisture. The vryne that is black like a moryan betokens also a deedly
moisture. The vryne yt is hole black as cole betokens a deedli bourned
moisture. The great learned master Auicenna writes in the second part of his
first book that the black vryne comes sometime of cold when the natural
hete of man is spent / or sometime of a bornynge hete which spends the
natural hete.

The black vryne betokens also that the mylte is stopped whereof comes
oftentimes the yelowe Iaundys / and the reason whereof is this / ye black
matery moisture may not come to the mylte / and therefore it draws to the
kydnes or bladder and is not deedly / but when it is black / made of small
quantyte having a stynkynge fume betokens great hete in the longues and is
also deedly. The black vryne betokens also a bourned moisture in tempore
crisis / when the nature of man shows the substance of his disease / and it
is not deedly. The black vryne of an unclean woman betokens that here
moisture named menstruu^ is current / and that is not deedly. The black vryne
betokens most part fevers quartayne / and it is also not deedly and
specially when he makes much at ones. The black vryne betokens oftentimes
disease in the kydnes and in the bladder / and is also not deedly.

The vryne of the color of lead that becomes afterward black / betokens
understanding of ye forenamed deedly black vryne. The black vryne myxted
with lead color / and almoost pure black / betokens ye loss of natural
hete and the stre^g^h of man. The vryne holy of lead color above and benethe /
and is much wors than ye urine that is pale or only yelowe above or that is
benethe black / or of the color of lead. The black or ledy color / which
has be^ grene before / is deedly as master Ysaac writes and testyfyeth. Wha^
the cercle of the vryne is pale / that betokens great dyseases in the brains
/ and betokens the tocommynge falling sickness named Epylencia. The vryne
that is of lead color betokens for the most part the waterysekesse named
the dropsy. The vryne (...) kubbled lead color betokens the cold pysse
named dyssurya.

The vryne that is black which has been before white and when the seek body
feleth pain in his left side betokens stoppynge in the mylte. The reed
vryne that after becomes to lead color / and when there hang small graynes
about the cercle sygnyfyeth dyseases in the longues named peripleumonia / and
also an i^postume named pleuresis. The white or led colored vryne having
white shelles therein swymmynge / sygnyfyeth the course or fluxu^ menstrualem of
women. The vryne of ledy color cominge of any person having a d^^^
co^sumpcio^ which sekenes is named p^^^ is also deedly. The vryne of ledy
color coming of any parsone having the ^^nesy in the heed is also deedly.
The vryne of a young child being of grene color sygnyfyeth the crampe coming
of cold as Auycenna testyfyeth in the second part of his first book. The
vryne that is grene of a strong fevers or axces / is also deedly / by the
reason of ye deedly hete wtin the body. The vryne that is grene of one that
has pain in the stomach / and when ye se a substance like yest laynge in the
bothom of this vryne / sygnyfyeth that the person is impoysoned.

The grene vryne after great labor and travel sygnyfyeth disease of the
crampe. The vryne that is clear and thynne betokens yt the mylte is stops
wtin ye body White vryne with a led colored cercle sygnyfyeth pain in the heed
/ or else the falling sickness The white vryne meddled with vater on the
bothom betokens hurtyng in the kydnes. And when ye vryne is sharp and
bytynge in the yssuwynge / it betokens dyseases in the bladder / or the
bladder has taken cold. The white or pale vryne where as white sand ro^neth
in / sygnyfyeth the stone in ye bladder. And wha^ the sand is reed it
sygnyfyeth ye stone in the kydnes / and pryncypally when the vryne is thycke
and fat / but when ye vryne is only fat above it betokens the hete of ye
kydnes which hete consumes ye fatness of the kydnes. White or pale vryne
which is very stynkyng / and little thereof made / is dedly. White or pale vryne
whero^ much sco^me or foam ha^geth about the cercle / betokens a moist head
and many wyn^es in tke belly. And when there hangs many little pybles or
belles about ye ^^^^le it betokens a slymy breast. White ^^^^^led vryne / like
the vryne of an ass long time contynuyng / sygnyfyeth great (...) in ye heed.
Vryne whereof little is made / and that like milk / betokens ye go^te / pale
vryne with a sad substance and a substance laynge on the bothom named
ypostasis that gooth not sharp over the vryne betokens the same body to be
dyseased with many moysty sekenesses and specially in the lymmes under the
nauyll as the kydnes and the bladder. In what vryne that the substance of it
laynge on the ground is white / going sharply over it betokens health.
White vryne which is subtle and thynne like water / betokens commonly (as
Egidius writes in his book of ye vryne) the watery sekenes named dropsye / and
pain in the mylte / and in the kydnes or the gowte in the members or the
falling sickness / or that the liver has taken cold / or the matryce has
taken cold / or the daily fevers / or quartayne. The pale vryne which is
thynne and clear betokens the same as does ye white vryne aforesaid. White
vryne like milk and little made betokens the gowt in the members / or the
falling of the palsy named Apoplexia. And this vryne betokens often the
gowte in the bowelles and specially when he feleth pain about the nauyll. The
vryne little made at one time betokens purgacyon / or the consumynge
sickness called ptisis / or stoppynge of the liver and mylte / or else an
vndysgestyfe moystoure (as Egidius writes) And wha^ this is much of the vryne
made betokens incontrary of the foresaid / like stoppynge of purgacyon
opening of the liver and mylte. Pale vryne which is also yelowe and thycke.
And when this synketh done on the ground on an hour like a fatness /
betokens stoppynge in ye mylte and kydnesse. The yelowe vryne wherein dryueth
a substance like here betokens dyseases in ye kydnes The vryne which is
reed and subtle with pybles or belles hanging on the vppermoost cercle
betokens an impostume on the breast named pleuresys / or the sickness in the
longue named peripleumonia And in those dyseases happeth some accedentes / as
the fevers / short of brethe with cowghynge / and thereby ye may know the
forenamed dyseases.

The vryne which is reed and thynne as before and after the fever betokens
the hete in the liver and kydnes. And specially when a man feleth hete without
on the liver and kydnes.

Reed vryne and thycke betokens an apostume on the liver and longues / and
also the fevers. Reed vryne and thycke betokens often ye watery sekenes /
named dropsy coming of cold and stoppyng of ye liver. Here follows ye
sygnyfycacyons of the vryne / wherein diverse matters he meddled as in the cercle.

THe cercle of the vryne / which is ye thycke in the substance / and watery
of color / sygnyfyeth pain in the hinder part of the heed. The cercle of ye
vryne which is thycke of substance and pure of color sygnyfyeth pain in ye
first perte of the foreheed. The cercle which is yelow or reed and thynne /
sygnyfyeth pain in ye right side of the heed. The cercle which is thycke in ye
substance / and of ledy color / sygnyfyeth ye palsy / named appoplexia or
the falling sickness / named epylencia. A subtle cercle / and grene of
color sygnyfyeth ye frenesy in the heed / as Auicenna says in ye first of his
book. A black cercle / which before was pale is deedly.

The vryne with much scume and little pybles / betokens hete / wyndes / and
fumes mountyng from the stomach in ye brain / which causes ye murre. The
vryne where in dryueth a substance like clouds / sygnyfyeth ye dysseases of
ye liver. The vryne where in ye bothom matter is and styncketh / sygnyfyeth
pain in ye kydnes and bladder. When in the vryne is blood / it comes from the
liver / or kydnesse / or bladder / or from the matryce.

Of the matter named sanies yt layth on the bothom of ye vryne. And of the reed
and white sand yt laid on ye ground or botho^ is enough before said.

When in the vryne apereth a substance or matter like bra^ne / or shelles /
without having ye fevers / betokens a sorry and scabby bladder / or dyseases in
ye bladder / and when this vryne apereth thus with the axcesse sygnyfyeth ye
co^sumyng sekenes named ptisis Wha^ in ye vryne ro^neth a substance like here
/ and the person has not the axcesse / it betokens pain in ye kydnes. And
wha^ the person is grieved with the axcesse and ye vryne is meddled with here and
oil / sygnyfyeth also ye co^sumynge sekenes named ptisis.

The vryne of a woman with sand in the ground betokens yt the flower of her
is stops named me^struu^. When ye sand in ye vryne of a woman is meddled with
blackenesse and thycknesse / not abydyng on ye ground or bothom / sygnyfyeth yt
the flower or menstruu^ ro^neth in time present. Wha^ such a sand^ is on the
ground in a ma^nys water betokens disease in the mylte. Little shelles
apperynge on ye ground of ye vryne And when about ye vryne pybles or belles
hangs sygnyfyeth ye gowte in the fete named podagra. When in the vryne of a
woman swymmeth a cloud meddled with shelles dryuyng up and done betokens that
the woman bears a child. When on ye ground or botho^ of ye vryne layth a
white cloud / which is sharp above / and on the ground thycke of his
substance / sygnyfyeth a parfyt healte of a man. When on the ground of the
vryne layth a white or black vryne which is not sharp above sygnyfyeth
disease in the lymmes benethe the nauyll / as in the kydnes or bladder.

All this fornamed iudycyalles of vrynes / is only the understanding and
opynyons of ye wordy and expert medycynes and masters / as Auicenna. Isaac.
Egidius does testyfye with many other diverse noble actours which have greatly
practiced for the prosperyte / health / and welfare of man where to they have
done great dylygens.

The exposicyo^ of the words obscure and evil known.
ALlopice is ye falling of here which makes blade places or pylled cleue
without here on ye heed. Also allopice is a manner of lepry through the which
the here of the brows and of ye bread does fall. Asma or asmatyke is wha^ any

Appoplexie is a manner of a palsye / and that comes in diverse parsones so
suddenly and so fervently that they lest thereby their wit / their
understanding / their memory or remembraunche and speech / and can not remene

dyfference between appoplexie and lytargye / for though in litargye there be no
hye speech / yet there is answer.

Antrax is an impostume full of fire / like unto ye fire of saint Anthony.
Trices be swellynges of the foundement / and not of the veins thereof / but
only about the foundement / and of that place be three diverse dyseases / as
ficus / fiatrices / and emorroydes / but there is dyfference / for emorroydes
or pyles be in the veins about the border of the foundame^t / and sometime it
does swell and nothing issues out of it sometime it bledeth to much / and
sometime it is full of dolorous pain. Atri^es be enflures or swellynges very
soft about the fou^dame^t. But fire or fie is a great thing about the
foundament which is within full of gros graynes like unto the graynes of
fyggues / and therefore it is called fycus.

Apperitiue is an opening of veins or other conduytes of the body / and also
of ye little holes of the skin through the which the sweet does issew / and
all stoppynges of veins / conduytes / or small sweet holes be named oppilacyons

yeldynge or voydynge any blood / but when they render blood they be named
ragadie. Consume / it is said that a medycyne consumed humors or other things
as wyndes when it resolves all or nere hand all except it void by sensyble
appearance. And is all one consumynge / or resoluynge / or departing or

incensible body.

Conglutinatiue / a medycyne conglury natyue is when it joins the rybbes or
joints together.

Colire is a medicyne that is clear of substance and is good for the eyes /
and that is named colire / and therefore if we find in the books of any
phisicia^s yt we should make colire / if his medycynes be hard it must be
puluerysed and myxted with wine or in water of herbs / or else as ye book
does deuyse and that is named colire and this medycyne of himself is clear
and may be made by himself / and if it be soft let it be made with clear
substaunces / and it shall be also colyre.

Cantere is wha^ one has a place where the cancre is in / or other dyseas that
require that sures to be made which is fyrye hete / cantere is in two manners /
the one by iron or other metal made read hot in ye fire / the other manner by
medycynes that be so hot that when they be laid to any membre they brenne it
like fire. The ca^tere that is made of fyrye metal is named cantere actual.
The other that is made by medycyne is named cantere potencyall Corrosiue is
when a medycyne byteth in deed flesh or other things / than it is named
corrosiue / and therefore these medycynes that be to strong corrosiues be named
canteres potencyall / as realgar or orpyment.

ounce and an half.

Dyssentere is the body flyx.

Diamargariton that is a confeccyo^ in the apoticarie which is so named.

Dyalthea is a salve and it is well beknowen / and commonly at the apotycaryes is

notyfyed Dissolve and dissolutyue is when any medycyne mynyssheth gross and
slyme humors / and makes them subtle thynne and clear / some show which do
dyssolue and which be dyssolutyfe / as the fire causes the ice to become

/ liquefy / and remyt is all one thing.

Dyaforetyke is when a medycyne spredeth humors and vapors insencyble which
be mynysshed in such manner / meued and made in so subtle vapor that it

Dragma is the.viii. part of an ounce.

Degree is the quantyte in the which the pacient or seek body is hot / cold /
dry or moist / and there be.iiii. degrees in medycynes / the fourth degree is
when the medycyne is so hot that it may no more except death / yet it would
slay any parsone that uses thereof in great qua^tyte. The third degree is when
it has less hete / and yet it is so greece yt he yt uses often of it shall
lightly be seek. The.ii. degree is wha^ it has yet less hete and is yet so
great that it may be manyfestly known through the perceueraunce of the great
hete that it has in. The first degree is when there is but little hete above the
complexyon of the parsone and so little hete that for ones occopyenge it is not
perceived that it warmeth ye body but by long contynuaunce it will be
perceived / and when the medycyne does nouther mean nor change the body /
than it is temperate / and thus is to be understand the degrees before named.

Dissurie is a dyseas when one can not pysse without pain / and of such be
two manners / the one is when ye seek bodi does pysse drope after drope / or
that he can not keep his water / or that the bladder has lost his retentyfe
virtue / or because that ye vryne is so heuely aggrauat that no man may endure
nor suffer it within ye bladder but yssueth contynually because the bladder or
neck thereof is perced or perysshed. And as soon as there comes any drope of
vryne it smarteth and bre^neth in such manner that it must nedys issue / and
this dyseas is named strangury / or strangulyon. The other dyseas is when any
one pysses with great pain or by gross humors yt stops the conduytes / or

can not put forth the vryn this dyseas is named dyssurye.

Dyuretyke / is when a medycyne of his proper nature is good to pysse / or
opens the inward veins / that is named dyuretyke / and this dyuretyke
opens or vnstoppeth the conduytes of the vryne and voydeth the gross humors
/ and he that should occupye it to much it would be for him to quycke / and
therefore it ware not good in strangury because of the great hete of the vryne /
thus in using of things is needful to be well looked on and regarded.

Dyaletyke passion is when one pysseth often and of great quantyte / and as soon as one has drunk he pysseth in contynent after / and that comes of the
hete of ye raynes.

Elephans is of two manners / the one is a spece of myfelery or lepry / whereof
all the members of the body leseth their fygures with great rystes and clestes
/ and is the most horrible dyseas that is / ye shall understand that of these
be.iiii. manners. The first is Alopyce whereof before is rehearsed / caused of the
corrupcyo^ of hot bre^nyng blood The second is named Leomine / and that is
when the myfelde has a face very horrible to behold / and is fyers and
