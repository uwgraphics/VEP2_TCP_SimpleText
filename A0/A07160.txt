A SACRED POEM DESCRIBING THE MIRACVLOVS LIFE AND DEATH OF THE GLORIOUS
CONVERT S. MARIE OF AEGIPT Who passed forty seven years in the deserts
leading a penitential life to the astonishment of all succeeding ages.

Plerumque gratior est Deo feruens post culpam vita; quam securitate torpens
innocentia. D. Greg.

THE ARGUMENT OF THE POEM FROM APPROVED AVTHORS.
MARY THE AEGIPTIAN being but 12. years old, left her Parents and came to
Alexandria: where for 17 years she prostituted her self to insatiable lust.
And to allure more to her company, exposed on free cost to their pleasure,
mayntayning her self in the mean time by begging and spinning of wool. It
happened that many sailed to Jerusalem to celebrate the festiuity of the
exaltation of the Holy Cross; whither she also traveled, not out of piety,
but to gain new associats to her sensual delights. And now arrived even at the
gates of the Temple, the rest continually entering, she alone strangely suffered
repulse. Which having 3. or 4. times sustained; at length she understood that
for her sins she was deemed unworthy to behold the holy Cross. Wherefore
seriously touched with compunction, and prostrate before an Image of the
Blessed Virgin, she implored her aid, that with the rest she might behold and
honor that sacred Instrument of our Redemption; promising from that time never
to contaminate her self with luxurious impurities. Then assaying to enter, she
found no stoppage as before; but (like the sea rolling forward the waves) the
multitude impelle her into the Temple. There according to her desire, having
honored the sanctified wood; she returned to the place, where formerly she had
made her promise to the Blessed Virgin. And a voice from heaven directed her
how she should dispose of her self for the glory of God and her eternal behoof.
Whereupon taking with her three loaves of course bread, she hastened to the
wilderness; and there for the space of 47. years, lived in such austerity as
she neither beheld man nor living creature, confining her self to the presence
of God and his Angels her sole spectators; her loaves after long tract of time
being spent, she for 17. years sustained her feeble body with herbs only and
roots; her garments rotting and falling from her: she was long so afflicted
with winters cold and scortching heats of that clymate, as often fainting and
void of breath, she laid on the ground destitute of sense and motion. For the
first 17. years after her entrance into the wilderness, she was assailed with
ugly and violent temptations; but through divine assistance still victorious.
To conclude after a wonderful and most penitential life, interseasoned with
divine consolations, Zozimas (a blessed Monk) coming into that part of the
desert, found her out; and ministered unto her the B. Sacrament on the Evening
of Maundy Thursday, and after spiritual conference with her departed the year
following upon her appointment, returning he found her deceased in a cave:
whither a lion then approaching dug up a grave, in which with tears and
prayers she was interred by Zozimas. The Roman Martyrologe and Vsuard recount
her day the 2. of April. The Grecians in their Menaloge observe it the day
before. Nicephorus lib. 7. cap. 5. affirms her life to have been written by
Sophronius Bishop of Jerusalem. The same is cited in the 2. Council of Nice.
And by St. John Damascen. orat. 3. de Imag: and translated into Latin by Paul
Diacon. Neopoleas, is extant in vitis Patrum: it was also composed in verse by
Hyldebrand Episc. Senon: and by Bonad. Santon lib. 3. Monad: 29. and others.
She lived about the year of Christ. 520. in the time of Iustine the elder.

THE MIRACVLOVS LIFE OF S. MARIE OF AEGIPT.
MARY of Aegypt's life I sing, and crimes,
To no less guilty, much more hardened times.
Smile truth: and ye, who both by choice and name
(O happy) may so great a patron claim,
Great in her looseness, greater in restraint,
A wondrous sinner, a more wondrous saint.
If my weak muse long nursed in wanton lore
Led by a better choice, then it was before,
(Blessed soul) thy praises chante: oh see and love
The first fruits of her penance: from above
Direct her flight, whiles she thy trophyes sings,
And impe new feathers to her tainted wings.
Christ's faithful spouse which long had groand, oppressed
By hell-bred Arrians swarming in the east,
After the amazement of that horrid night.
Was now restored to hit wonted light
By Justin namd the Elder: fears were past,
And (wicked error by fair truth displast')
The Church inioyed an universal peace
Praising the giver: so when loud storms cease,
The merchant safe, paves on the calmer shore,
Such thankful vows as he had made before.
The now free temples through the cittye, were
Throngd' by all sorts of people: psalms each where
With hymns of joy are shrilld' by every tongue,
And loud TE-DEVM'S by the Clergy sung.
The noise rings through the air: a pleasing sound.
And there receaud', does with new joy rebound
From th'ecchoing angels to, th'allmighty's ears,
Who pleased with their zeal, from starre-crownd' spheres
Viewing the city and imperial throne
Of great Byzantium: approues what is don.
Thence Eastward twining his all-seeing eyes,
The sacred land of palestine surueyes,
No region so forcibly inuites
His mild aspect, no air so much delights:
For there is his garden, there those happy groaues
Where first he stoopt' (o strange) to mortal loves*
There Caluarye showerd with aeternal blood,
There Sion, Oliuet, and Iordans flood,
There Nazareth; Bethlem, powerfullye arrest
His heavenly eye: and oh, above the rest,
Here him a band of living saints inuites
(Poor Threadbare monks) to grace their pious tites:
The Almighty's self their burning zeal admires,
Their many altars, and perpetual quyers,
Their close retired walks, their silent celles,
Their lowely cloisters, and far distant wells,
So suncke of purpose that their drink and meat
Might aequally be purchased with their sweat,
For they their food seek in the open fields,
Or eat the croppe which their own labor yields.
Here contemplation without noise or strife
Inioyes it is peace, mixed with the active life,
Whiles Mary sighing swimmes in pious tears,
Laborious Marthe her burden gladly bears:
For love both sisters in one bond unites,
Shares aequally their labors and delights:
The world's great Ruler plays his part the whiles,
Adds flame to flames, and at their fervor smiles.
Yet no one soul could fix with more delight
The Almighty's eye, then that poor naked wight
Which howling from the desert, with Loud cries
And doleful clamours rent the iniurd' skies:
Groueling on earth, her eyes bathd in warm streams,
Her witherd arms parcht' with Sol's fyery beams
Stretched at their length: the rest, a naked coarse
In hoary tresses clad: with zealous force
She beats at heavens bright gates: and strong in faith
Urges her pardon: and her pardon has:
Have mercy lord, the worst of sinners prays,
Mercy my god: forget my damned days,
For her dear sake, whose blessed name I bear:
Ah can a Mary pray, and thou not hear?
O powerful charm! the very name could move
Both the effects of pardon, and of love.
That everlasting goodness which long since
Had razd' the memory of her former sins,
And those black characters, which her true tears
Had (for thespace of seven and forty years)
washed with unwearied streams: not pleasd' that she
(whose life t'all sinners might a comfort be,
And had so pleased his eternal eye)
Unknown, vnhonourd', in those shades should dye,
Pointed out of his all foreseeing care
A grave old moncke, his wonders to declare:
A glorious father, Zozimus his name,
In goodness great, great in desert and fame,
And who perhaps much greater might have been,
Had he been less in his own greatness seen:
Poor man already he seemd' even to play
On vertu's green, and to have won the day,
Sings joyful Paeans, gloryes in his years,
Grown hoary in long penance: and appears
That desart's only sun (in his own sight)
Whence younger saints receaued' a borrowed light.
Unwise: for whiles he snatcheth at a crown
Which might ere long, have justly been his own,
He falls: thinks darkness light: falls still, and even
As he is falling, thinks he mounts to heaven,
So when our Northern Tine swelles ore the strands,
Planing the fatal foard with both the lands:
Some daring traveler spurs on enragd',
Nor sees the peril, til too far ingagd',
Measuring his own life by the sea-like streams,
Too late alas, intrapt' twixt two extremes
He doubtful pauseth, if he forward press
The danger's great, should he turn back, not less:
Mean time, pale fear his better sense bereaues,
And fiercer current his weak eye deceaues,
For still borne down by it is resistlesse force,
Still dreams he rides too high: his wiser horse
Bears strongly with the stream, but toils in vain;
His master masters him: some-one amain
Whoopes from the shore, Bear up, Bear up: he hears:
But false eyes trusts more then his truer ears:
Til swept away by the remorselesse flood
H'is lost, and makes it is fatal surname good.
Such or much worse might have been Zozims end,
Had he not heard a far more powerful friend,
Who through the organs of a whistling wind,
In aerie sounds thus checked his aerie mind:
Many, as aaged, more holy, and less proud,
Their virtues in this sacred desert shroud:
Fly therefore hence, and leave the place, in which
Pride and self-loue thy better thoughts bewitch:
A Convent near the banks of Jordan stands,
Not great in circuit, or extent of lands,
But great in sanctity: there seek, and find
The cure of a self-delighted mind.
His eyes are opend', and his sin appears
More great, augmented by ensuing fears,
For what can now securehim, who fell
(Thinking himself in heaven) as deep as Hell:
He falls as low, as he had soard' too high,
Anthaeus-like resuming strength there by:
For whiles he prostrat cleaues to his mother earth,
By blazoning in it is molde his baser birth,
He rises, stronger then he was before,
Less in his own eye, but in god's much more:
And takes his journey, guided by that hand
Which erst when Abram left his native land,
His house and friends, was with him in his way,
And held him least he from truth's path should stray.
A witherd stick his trembling iointes sustaines,
Whiles wandering through vast woods, and vaster plains,
Still from above imploring light and grace,
He seeks near Jordan the desired place:
Which where the river straightened twixt two hills
The hanging cliffes with hollow echoes shrilles,
He found at last: a Convent of small show
Yet well contriued', the walls and roafe, both low,
No gluring outside, no art's new devise,
Of curious worldlings to allure the eyes:
No path but one, and that but little vsd',
Which brought our zozim in himself confusd'
At such retyrednesse, to one only gate,
It opening from within: there weak he sat
With grief and toil: his former life now blames,
And these poor monks thrice happy he proclaims,
Whose inward sanctitye he quickly guest
By What, their outward solitude expressed:
Thus humbled in himself, he knockes with fear
As one not worthy to find entrance there.
The porter (having eyed him through the grate)
Informs his Prelat of his form and state:
He strait descending, in the entry meets
The stranger: whom embracing, thus he greets:
Welcome grave father: what could we deserve?
Unworthy servants of him whom you serve,
That you should visit us here, poor beginners,
Il mortifyed and halfe-conuerted sinners?
Zozim abasht, bends his brim-swelling eyes
Down to the earth: and sighing thus replies:
I seek perfection here, grown old in pride
O take me for his sake who for such dyed.
The Abbot glad receaues him: there he lives
With saints, a saint: and disinchanted gives
Not now t'himself, but to those holy syres
Virtue's full praise: sees in them, and admires
Their patience, zeal, humilitye profound,
Raysd' by pure rapts above the starry round,
Nimble obedience, charity in all,
Whose charter warrants it shall never fall,
Al things wel-orderd', and in the quyer
Perpetual vigils, harmonye, and prayer.
But winter now declining, had begun
To feel the power of a warmer sun
And Februarye old praepard to yield
To springing March the honor of the field,
Wensday the first of clensing days appears
When the whole Convent to one room repaird'
And having craved assistance from above
Came forth in unity, in peace, in love,
Praepard' to cross the river: as each year
In this blessed season they accustomd' were,
To keep lent silent, nor to meet again
Til the renewing of the sacred Cene.
The gate as loathe to part with such loud' ghests
It Is grief in th'opening with loud groans attests,
whiles matching down to Jordan the whole quyer
In order sings this psalm led by the Priour.
Psalm 26.
HEnce fear: our lord's my safety and my light:
My life s protector: what shall me affright?
Whiles bad men on me rusht, my flesh to tear,
My foes who vext' me fell, and weakened were:
Opposed Camps my courage shall not quell,
In battle strong here fixed my hopes shall dwell;
One thing I Have asked our lord, this I Will request,
That in his house I all my days may rest,
That I his joys may view and temple blessed;
For he has kept me in his sanctuary, in
It Is closest vaults, safe from the days of sin:
H'ath reard' me on the rock: and placed me out
Of foe's reach: in his house I Have romd' about,
Offering an hoaste of clamor: I will sing
And say a psalm to heauen's aeternal king:
My voice o lord to thee loud-crying hear,
Have merry on me, and to me give ear,
To thee my heart spoke, thee mine eyes desire,
To thee o lord I ever will aspire:
Turn not, nor in thy wrath decline thy face
From me thy servant: help me with thy grace:
Oh do not leave nor slight me in thy scorn
My savior and my God: for me forlorn
My parents both have left: but thou did take
Compassion on me. Lord unto me make
A law in thy way, and the right path guide,
Least my proud enemies should thee deride:
Nor yield me to the wills of raging foes
For periurd' witnesses against me rose,
And sin has tyed' t'it self: I shall, I trust,
Thy joys see, in the region of the just:
Expect our lord and manfully defend
Thy self: take comfort, and our lord attend.
Amen.
Amen sung loud the psalm concludes: Amen,
The ecchoing hills and dales intone again.
When they at Iordans banks arrived, and stood
Musing awhile upon the sacred flood,
The zealous troop with joy recalles to mind
Those wondrous signs of love which to mankind
God there had showed: salutes with humble vows
The place, it is tutelar Genius: and bows
In memory of it is saints: foam grouesing lie,
Kiss th'hallowed banks, and streams as they slip by:
Some gladly under the blessed current fall,
Some wash their heads, their hands and faces all:
Then ferrying over to the farther side
They into several paths themselves divide,
Al to the desert tending, none can stray
Unless he meeffe his fellow in the way,
For then who first the other coming spies
Leaving that walk, to thickes and couerts flies,
Least the shye enemy with secret pride
Should blast their better actions, When discryed
By more eyes then their own. Oh that we could
Those glorious conquests to the world unfold,
which these religious fathers daily gaind'
In their vnboasted conflicts: whiles restraind
From mutual consolations, often assayld
By visible spirits, they as often praeuayld'
Against their fyery legions: restless grief,
Furious assaults, fresh combats, no relief,
No hope, but from above: oh tho the height
Of self-contempt have left in clouds of night
Their memoryes obscured: yet their fame
Characterd in wide heauen's immortal frame
Shall ever live, and they for ever rest
In the triumphant mansions of the blessed.
Among althese fathers which even then prepard'
Their souls to their not rashly hopd' reward,
Not least in goodness, tho in order last;
The late checked Zozimus with zealous have
Enters the solitude: spends nights and days
In heavenly contemplations: duly prays
At his accustomd' hours: never eaten
But when with famine forced, and then such meats
As the wild wood afforded: never sleeps
But when stolen slumbers through the entries creepes
Of his watched soul: then some knobd' tree in stead
Of pillow serves, the earth, his native bed,
Wide heaven his canopye, his rugge and sheets
The frost's pearld' deawe, cold rines, and piercing fleetes:
Where with his long white hair and hoarye beard
Entangled often in icye knots appeard,
When some times guided by the morning star,
Some times the slowe-pacd' waine-mans stooping car,
His weak legs (prompted by a strong desire
Where with it seems the willing heaueus inspire
His forward soul) resume their daily toil
Wading through thick and thin: new longings boil
In's flaming breast, new thoughts infusd' from heaven,
Make the rough ways seem smooth, the mountains even.
Whiles daylight serves his journey never ends,
When night comes on, the night in tears he spends,
His truly humbled soul, now only blind
To see it is own perfections, earnes to find
Some saint-like father in that desert place,
Who may instruct him in the way of grace,
For this he makes reiterated vows
To heaven: for this to earth his knees he bows,
And strong in faith tho for a time delayed
Persists: still praying hopes, still hoping prayed
The twentyeth day night's foggye damps had cleard,
And brighter sun upon the heights appeard,
When he his hours ending, with the day
Renewed his task, and westward took his way:
Westward far of upon a plain, he spies,
Amoouing bulk, of what his failing eyes
Cannot yet judge, but toward it he makes,
Doubling his pace, and at the nearest takes,
Thwarting the spacious plain: nor long it was
Ere he a doleful wretch, and naked as
Simplicitye it self, discernd: whose face
(Tho black and old) yet wanted not it is grace:
Which in a countenance grave, and well composd'
(Tho to al weathers and al suns exposd')
Held good, against the iniuryes of time,
Of place, of grief, and of the open clyme:
He stood aloof: and viewed her, whiles her eye
Fixed on a higher object, past him by:
Her age, her naked chin, and unshorn head,
Whence white crispe locks in frosty curles were spread
Over her blacker neck, strait made her known,
A woman: or th'anatomye of one,
Long abstinence and penance having brought
Her body to a leanness beyond thought.
Pale trembling fear the monke's whole body shakes
And he his own long-wished hopes mistakes,
Thinks that he sees some ghost, or Hellish fiend,
To Torments in that wilderness confind'.
Yet curbes his fear, and bold in his own right,
Prepares him: not unused to such fight:
The cross it is sign he forms, first on himself,
Then on the air, and the supposed elfe,
Whose much consid'ring eye had neither seen
Him nor his cross, but still held on the green:
The monk strait by a better thought inspird',
Conceaues his happiness so long desyrd',
For which he often had sighd', and oftimes prayed,
Whiles in that tedious solitude he straid:
His sudden fear to sudden joy gives place,
And he pursues her steps, whose saint-like face
Already he disdaines not to implore,
But hastening after, sends these words before:
O stay thou blessed soul, by heavens beloud',
And be not at a sinner's presence moud'.
The solitary saint (whose long-closd ears
Had heard no voice in seven and forty years,
Nor doleful eyes yet met with any face
Of mortal creature in that forlorn place)
Amazed' and blushing at her naked plight,
Borne on the wings of shame takes speedy flight,
And in those long known woods a skilful guide,
Strives in the depth of them her shame to hide.
The aged father strengthened with desire
Flying with equal speed, pursues the flyer:
She fast, he faster runs, she prays, he cries:
And when his feet fail follows with his eyes:
A wondrous race, fool angels looking on,
Fittest spectatours when such angels run:
But Zozimus winnes ground, and gets so near,
As she (he thought) these breathless words might hear:
Oh stay: by his great name I thee conjure
For whom thou live in solitude obscure:
Take pity of mine aage, my silver hairs,
Whose frosty white the marks of reverence bears:
Hear me a doleful sinner: ah regard
These flowing tears: even as thou hopes reward
After so strange a penance: do not fly,
Not cruel to a dying man deny
Thy prayer and blessing: for his love, I say,
Who flighteth none that with true fervor pray:
Thus praying the old man ran, and running prayd'
Her answer shame, and inward grief delayed:
He vexed with labor, much more vexed in mind,
Still begs, still cries, stil's answered with the wind.
A p^^ne there was where in some winter-torrent
Had left the vast print, of it is elder current:
The shiuerd rocks and rent up oaks yet showd',
How dreadfully it erst had over flowed,
Now a dry channel, hollow, empty, wide,
Through which a little brook did stealing glide
Amongst the crags and logges: which since that aage
The swelling flood had left, marks of it is rage:
The Aegiptian first to this dry gulf attaind,
Slipped lightly through, and further bank had gaignd',
When the old man panting, weak, and wholly spent,
Fearful to venture on the rough descent,
Takes up: yet with his voice pursues the saint,
Reiterates with tears his late complaint,
Coniures her by her self, those caves, that wood
The witness of her life, by all that is good
In heaven or earth: and finding all but vain
Howles and laments his undeserved pain;
Then roaring out with doleful out cries shrilles
The channel's concaue and the hanging hills,
From whence redoubled they again rebound
Through echoes sad, a lamentable sound.
The holy fugitif, moved with his tears.
Replied at last, and thus made known her fear,
Time-honourd Zozimas, whose life and name
I honor from my soul: bear with my shame,
And nakedness, which shuns thy grauer e ye
And tho unwilling, yet is forced to fly:
But if a caytif wretch thou needs wilt grace,
And longst' to see a forlorn sinner's face:
Lend me thy cloak that clad therein, I may
Blessed with thy blessing, praying with thee pray:
The monke's amazd', to hear his name from one
To whom he altogether was unknown:
Yet silently admiring that foresight,
Which he new came from more than human ligh t
His mantle throws, which whiles he walked aside
She taking up, about her shoulders tied:
Then to him came: he at her feet adores,
And benediction with teers implores:
She no less humbled, prostrat also lies,
And craves that which he both craves, and denies,
So whiles they for each other's blessing strive,
Both want what both would have, but neither give:
At last, th Egiptian thus her suit renewes,
And with fresh wonders his assent pursues:
Father, deny not to a wretch that grace,
Whic h is most proper to your years and place,
Yo ur sanctitye and habit: your pure hand
W hich daily touches, and has at command
Ou r God and maker is it self thereby
Mos t blessed: and'ts blessing should to none deny.
Zo zim abasht, replies with sobs and tears,
M ost blessed mother, ah it well appears
T hat nothing from your knowledge is conceald,
T o whom (...) in spirit these things are reueald,
H appy whose better part to this world dead
Is to the bosom of it is maker fled,
Wh ere your pure soul in his bright eye discouers
Those secrets, which are only given to lovers:
O since our merits are not iugd' by place,
But by the gifts of his effectual grace,
Let not your sanctity disdain to bless
Our more in dignity, in goodness less.
The Father thus importunately prayed:
She with compassion moud' kneeld up, and said:
Blessed be God, who saues the souls of men:
Then rose: and Zozim rising, cried Amen.
Father (says she) lo, you have found at last
After much toil, and many labors past,
A most unfortunate creature, and one,
Whose little goodness had you sooner known,
You would not with such earnest zeal have sought,
Nor a poor sinner's sight so dearly bought:
Yet since I think you only were designd'
By heavens high will, these silent shades to find,
T'impart some pious help, which well I know,
Your charitable hand is sent to do
About this wretched carcass: pray, relate,
How things are swayd' abroad, say in what state
The Affairs of Emperors and Christians are?
How the holy church, and our brethren fare?
He answer made: our mother church long tossed
With Arrian storms, long by bad princes crossed,
At last inioyes a calm of wished peace,
Whiles heresies and civil tumults cease,
Through your good prayers: wherefore let me crave
Some part in them, since they such power have:
Oh if directed by the powers above
I hither came, nor my poor presence move
Your soul, to just contempt: be pleasd' to pray
For me staind' sinner, that this tedious way
May not be wholly fruitless, which I tread,
Ready to make my passage to the dead,
Pray for the church, whole world, and for me crave
That I may part securely to my grave.
Father said she: not I: a sinful wretch,
But you your purer hands to heaven should stretch,
For all distressed souls: this as our due,
We from your orders challenge, and from you:
Yet since obedience bids me to fulfill
Not what I think most fit, but what you will,
Lo, I obey; this said: she humbly folds
Her much-worne knees, her naked hands she holds
Stretched at their full length, to the Orient sky,
Her soul even swimming in her fixed eye:
Silent she prays, the cause her tears must gaigne,
Dumb orators which never plead in vain,
Inevitable charms, al-forcing streams,
Which heaven delighting in, with powerful beams
Attracts unto it self, and with such force,
As even the compound of her heavier corse
Follows her melting soul, and fixed remains,
Betwixt heauen's bright arche, and earth's spacious plains:
Whiles it more light the whirling orbs transcends,
And to the bosom of it is maker tends.
Zozim thewhile admiring that high grace,
And fervor, which appeared in her face:
Now lost in wonder, to the low earth sinkes,
And at his own lamented coldness shrinkes:
Thumps his bare breast, and as he groueling lies,
Deplores his own sins, and for mercy cries:
When lo the slye-fiend prompts him, that this might
Be some illusion, some infernal spright,
And sticks not wrongfully himself t'accuse,
(Who justly would not) the old man to abuse:
Poor man he doubts, and whiles he fears deceat,
Is cosend': Satan smiling at his cheat.
When she, whose soul had strayd' above the sphaeres,
Retourning to her place perceaud' his fears
Through the clear glass of that eternal light,
Through which al see, but see not with such sight:
Father, says she: what troubled thought is this?
Which makes you judge of me, and judge amiss,
As though I only made a show to pray,
A stumbling-blocke of scandal in your way:
I am no spirit: but true flesh and blood,
Once white as snow, washed in th'al-clensing flood
Of holy baptism: now as black as shame
And sin can dye an euer-tainted fame:
Here-with her forhead, eyes, her lips, and breast,
Signing them with a reddy hand she blessed:
Saying, o father, may our lord preserve
Al these poor souls, which him would truly serve,
From Satan and his sleights. Whose hopeless state
Does not a little grudge our better fate.
He falling at her feet, his own breast beats,
And her whole life's relation thus intreates:
Blessed saint: whose soul from worldly noise divided,
Is in this wilderness by angels guided,
Even for his sake, who for our sakes was borne
Of virgin's spotless womb, whom raggd and torn
The Angels in mount Calurye saw amazd':
And on his wounds with admiration gazd':
For his dear sake I say: for whom thou bearst'
These marks of penance, for whose love thou wearst'
This glorious nakedness: oh let-me know
What, whence, thou art, and how long it is ago,
Since first thou hither came, a heavenly ghest,
Leaving the world impou'risht of it is best:
Oh say: and nothing in dark silence fold,
Which to God's holy honor may be told.
For this (it seems) this tedious life of mine
Has been prolongd' by providence divine,
For this, directed by a heavenly voice,
I left my native celle, and former choice,
My self alone in these dark caves designd,
The rarest wonder of this age to find:
And will you (ah too nice) those great works hide?
Which God himself (it seems) would have discryed:
High graces often to private souls are lent,
But to a general good their use is meant,
These by concealing, you will usurp a due,
We must ascribe to heaven, and not to you.
The holy penitent with tears, begins
To call to memory her former sins:
Then sighing, spoke: behold, my vnfaind grief
And blushing eyes bewray my guilty life,
Though my grieud' soul paint in this outward show
Those soars, which on it like foul leapers grow,
Since you my naked out side did behold,
I shall with like simplicitye unfold
A blacker inside, and such sins, I fear,
You Will fly me as some fiend, when them you hear:
First praying you, incessantly to pray,
That in the last of days, that dreadful day
To guilty souls, when heaven and earth combind
Shall stand against us, I may mercy find.
With tears he only answring: she pursues
And adding tears to tears, her grief renewes.
Borne, where the fruitful Nile oreflows the land,
And leaves it mannurd' to the farmers hand,
At twelve years age cloggd' with the tender love
And care of mine old parents, I remove
To Alexandria that royal seat,
That farre-famd' little world, that city great,
That fatal rock, on which much youth vnstayd*
And many a lady's honor shipwreck made,
Who now with me, may curse that il-famd' coast
On which our better names we fondly lost,
I blush to speak my first fault, and to tell,
How from the state of innocence I fell,
Nor think it fit, your chaster ear to wound
With the most horrid and detested sound,
Of my unsatiably bad desires:
No flame can match them but hel's native fyers:
Let this suffice, full seuenteen years, and more,
I in that city liud' a common whore,
Neither did I at first mine honor grant
Tempted with gold, or overcome with want:
Nor since through avarice have I welterd in
The un bridled rage of this detested sin,
But drownd' in damned lusts, I held the vice
Reward sufficient, and its own price,
Where by to sin, and craft in sin, inurd',
More customers I wickedly allurd,
Living upon my needle bare and poor,
Whiles forct' to beg my bread from door to door:
Cursed wretch the mouths of Orphans to defraud,
And who first made blessed poverty a bawd,
Which rather then the charges should distaste
My wicked mates, I willingly embraced:
Thus long I sayld on deep damnation's seas,
Whiles only lust my lustful soul could please,
Yet still unsatisfied, and never tyrd'
The more I find, the more to sin desired',
When one day, walking on the sands, I spyed
Great multitudes thronging to this seaside,
Bound for the holy land: the feast drew near
Of the holy roode, and these al pilgrims were:
With them some toye, or rather some bad fiend
Took me to join: I called to one: my friend,
Pray tell me, is there room aboard to spare,
Enough he answered, paying for your fare:
Tush, with foul gestures, said I: here is as good,
Making my fouler meaning understood.
Pardon me holy father, for I wrong
Your chaster ear, detayning it so long
On these black sins, which whiles I here declare,
My baneful breath infects the purer air:
And heaven knows with what horrors I relate
Th'abominations of my former state:
Mother, said he, let not this cloud of shame
Obscure the glory due to his great name,
Whose power and grace such crimes can only clear,
And no where more then in our sins appear.
Then she continued thus: upon the sand
Ready to boat I saw an able band
Of tall young men, amongst whom I rushing in,
With frontlesse impudence did thus begin:
Have with you gallants, where so ere you are bound,
And think not that of me (firs) you have found
A thanklesse wretch, for truly you shall see,
That I am open hearted, kind and free:
My strange immodesty their laughter moves,
They al profess, and I accept their loves:
With such lewd speeches, and much worse then these,
I woed those youths, and with them took the seas,
Hoping, if ever, in such choice to find
Pleasure, as ample as my boundless mind.
Now o thou man of God how can I tell
Those sins, fit only to be known in Hell,
No mortal tongue can speak, no godly ear
Can without horror, their relation hear:
Yet this I Will say: what art, or lust could do,
What fiends could tempt the worst of creatures to,
I there came guilty of: which when I now
Recall to memory, I wonder, how
Those swelling tides were not allowd' to sweep
My sinful soul to th'euer-lasting deep:
Ah no! whiles I even in sins ocean liud'
That shoare-lesse mercy my poor soul repriud':
That long-forbearing God, who would have none
To perish, calmd' from his eternal throne
The fury of the sea, and angry wind,
Against their maker's enemy combind.
At last we landed on the Syrian shore:
I still the same, taled on my hellish score,
For all that journey, as by land we went,
My malice on the wreak of souls was bent,
Not only sinning with my long-knowne band,
But tempting many natives of the land,
And even to them, who for devotion came,
Shame-lesse to all made proffer of my shame.
Now O, the very thought for judgment calls
Of those sins, which within the holy walls
I durst commit, even where a crimson flood
Had washed the streets with my wrongd' saviors blood:
Where not one soul so bad, as had the force
To view those places, without some remorse,
My devilish self excepted: dare I say
That on the Eeue of that al-honourd' day,
Nay even the day of th'exaltation: I
(When every one repented, every eye
Was turned to heaven) contriud' the while to win
As many partners, as I could, to sin.
Pardon my shame sir if too fast I run
From this foul Hell, to the more gracious Sun
Of my conversion: no words can express
My sins, the mercyes of my God, much less.
Bright was the morn, and Tythons love, graye-eyed,
Her purest sky in purpled streams had did,
The golden Sun, which then appeard before
I'ts usual time, ran poasting to adore
The euer-honourd cross: dumb things declard'
Their joy by signs, and for the feast prepard':
Noe soul, in which the foulest sins had swarmd',
But then came with remorce and penance armd',
I who that sacrament of grace abhord',
More than the just edge of heauen's angry sword,
Never more bold in sin, more hard in heart,
Came in this feast to act my hellish part,
Where with coye looks, and wanton words, in vain,
I labourd some unhappy soul to gaigne,
Thus wicked both in action and intent
I with the people to the temple went.
A building of such glory, state, and cost,
Mine eyes in it is vnmeasurd' hugeness lost,
Could not but vnder-prize those antique frames,
Wherewith our Egypt it is less wonders fames:
The skye-crownd roof (which in the midst no art
Could join) the holy Sepulcher, and part
Of Caluary, includes in th'oual round
Of it is extended circuit, vast, profound;
I'ts out side (sheets of brass) with fyerye streams
Blinds curious eyes from Sols' retorted beams:
White marble-columnes seventy three, uphold
The inside, archt, and parietted with gold:
Each pillars base and cornish cut, and wrought
In curious imagery, the transomes fraught
With counterfaits of saints, such as old time
Has most esteemd of, in the churches prime:
Gallerd above, the walls and arches crested,
Twice-guilt, and with choice floritrye invested:
Party-colourd marble laid checkerwise,
In varyed heawes the polisht flooer dies:
The windoors equal to the roof in height,
Through the whole fabric spread a gladsom light,
Whereof each one supported with three rows
Of marble pillars, like t'a temple shows:
Between each rank with running transomes crossed
Fretted with gold, and curiously imbost:
The outside of the wall, (where wall there was,
For some might think it had no wall but glass)
Had round about, with-in it is hollow pents
The glittring statues of a thousand saints,
With such rare art, in the pure marble carud',
The workmanship alone for wonder serud'.
Such is this sumptuous temple: than the which,
The world has none more great, more famd', more rich,
The work of Roman Hellen: having viewd'
This goodly building, boldly I intrude,
Borne with the ride of the in-preasing crowde,
Which like the oceans swelling billowe flowd',
To th'entry of the church: fool that I was'
To think such sins could through that portal pass,
The double gate within it is brazen leaves,
Without resistance, the whole press receaues,
Where I in impudency only strong,
Thought to have past with the more pious throng:
But as the crowde had swayd' me to the gate,
I still was driven back, by some hidden fate:
Thousands I saw, which past on every side,
Entrance to none, but to my self, denied:
Toucht*with amazement, not yet with remorse,
Again I forward preast with greater force:
Again that unseen angry arm, I feel,
And forced back with a greater force, I reele:
Even they, who in the stream next to me were,
Past freely through the gates, and left me there:
Thrice thus enraged, through the throng I brake,
Thrice, in the same sort, I was beaten back:
At last perplexed in mind, in body tyrd',
Confusd' with shame, and wonder, I retyrd'.
Faint I sat down, and eying the open gate,
Thus fretted to my self: what sullen fate
Resists my entry? and with broad disgrace
Excludes me only from this hallowed place?
O, in this world of people is there none?
With as great sins, although perhaps, less known
Than mine are, which have entered: if there be?
Why am I only plagud', al others free?
Here wrath and indignation inflame
My undiscerning soul, with angry shame:
Blind that I was, who in this frantic mood,
Could not discrye the first spring of my good:
But tamer reason calming this hot brunt,
Summons my past life to a strict account,
Forcing my much-rakt' memory t'vnscroule
My too-long-folded sins, a fatal roale:
My seeing soul with ghastlye terrors faintes,
Chill horror in deaths palest colors paints
Dismaydnesse in my face, hell in my thought,
And all the torments wherewith hell is fraught.
Here grace began it is powerful beams to shed,
Which in my soul, remorse and sorrow bred:
Those hydeous sins which erst but pastimes were,
Through this new light, in their true form appear,
Such, as their greatness none else can conceive,
Nor others better-minded, would believe,
That ever such sins were: sins which the earth
Were guiltless of, had it not given me birth,
A greater monster than the which, til now
It never teemd', nor after this shall do:
Fear of eternitye, and hel's black shades,
With horrors near my fainting soul inuades,
That cunning fiend, which hitherto had soothd'
My sinful disposition, and had smoothd'
The harsh way of damnation, now appears
In his own hideous shape, augments my fears,
Makes my sins greater, then indeed they are,
For none so great as ought to cause despair,
Else infinitely bad, we might sin more,
Than Gods most infinite goodness could restore,
O father, how the grief of what had past,
And fear of torments, which for ever last,
Rent my sad heart, where in despair took place,
Striving to dim that little beam of grace,
Through which my soul already did begin
To see, and hate the foulness of it is sin:
When lo on each side troubled, and distressed,
That self-same grace my weeping eye addressed
T'a goodly image, heawd' in parian stone:
The virgin mother, with her little one,
Folded in her pure arms: such as the light
Of the twin-starre, shows in a stormy night
To hope-lesse sailors, such appeatd' this phare
To my soul, running th'hazard of despair:
With humbled head, and much more humbled heart
I kneel, and kneeling, thus my woes impart:
Most blessed virgin, far more blessed mother
O ever blessed in both, above al other,
Although I know, how il, so dire a wretch
May her polluted hands for favor stretch,
How il I may presume to look for grace,
From thy deservedly auerted face,
Since hell more opposite can nothing find,
To the eternal purity of thy mind,
Then this confused chaos of al crimes,
Slave to her lusts, and monster of these times:
I know so staind a soul should not expect
Other, from thee, than hatred, and neglect,
Yet since it pleasd' that little son of thine,
That mighty God, that power al-diuine,
For so despisd'a wretch, himself t'expose
To al our miseryes, and disastrous woes;
Mother of mercy, b'it not said, that thou
Didst' ere reject, an humbled sinner's vow:
Obtain for me (what can that son refuse
For which so dearly loud' a mother sues)
That I poor sinner, though a worth-lesse ghest,
Yet may assist at this al-honourd' feast,
And prostrat, with true sorrow, may adore
The marks of his dear wounds, and sacred goare:
Thou spot-lesse virgin, which art ever bent
To succor such, as truly would repent:
Lo here I vow, and from this hour begin
To hate, and fly al paths, which lead to sin:
Be thou my suerty (who can allege
To thy great son a more accepted pledge)
As soon as entered I shall have adord'
His holy cross, and his great name implord*
My self from worldly joys I will retire,
Both truly in effect, and in desire:
Be thou my guide, and graciously impart
Comfort, and help: for thou my suerty art.
Thus having prayed: not rashly, confident,
Under so great a patroness I went,
And where the meeting throngs of such as enterd,
Shock't with the issuers forth, I fearelesse venterd:
Oh father, hear, and wonder: have you seen
The iustling waves on Neptune's foaming green?
When winds and tides, at variance, strongly plea
For empire, on the billow-breaking sea:
No otherwise, the floating multitudes
Shouldring each other in opposed crowdes,
In streams uncertain yet, wave too and fro
Whiles some roale backwards others forward flow,
These coming on even at the portal fail,
Now th*out comers, th'incommers now prevail:
My self, like to a bowe-shot arrow flew,
And borne with equal speed, through either crow
(Which way or how I past I can not tell)
Prostrat before the sign of triumph fell.
Here fear and horror, springing from the tide
Of ouer-flowing joy, my soul divide,
Guilty of it is own sins: a flood of tears,
Badges of inward sorrow, drown my fears
In seas of true content: no joy has life
Compard' to this sad joy, this ioye-ful grief:
Hence, springs true hatred of my former sins,
Hence, heavenly love with better hopes begins
To spread pure flames, and my best part inspires,
O that a stream of tears should raise such fyers!
The marbled flooer groueling I embraced,
And cleansd' the checkerd flags with kisses chaste,
Then crawling on, and kneeling at the foot
Of the holy cross, I bathd' it is sacred root
With flowing tears, and empty hoales adord'
Yet with the blood of my redeemer goard':
Oh what a full content, what seas of bliss
My soul swam in! lost in the vast abyss
Of that vnmeasurd' love, which for our good
Left these sad marks, of his much-wasted blood:
Unworthy I, my sexes shame, the worst
Of Aegipt's monsters, and the most accursed,
Led by so great a patroness, was free
To kiss the foot, of his blood-honourd tree,
And through her favor made my guilty eyes
Partakers of it is glorious misteryes:
And oh such sweetness there, such odours felt,
As none can guess, the same who have not smelt
A heavenly sent: the like, no flowrye field,
Perfumd' panchaia, nor Sabaea, yield:
My harder heart now in warm tears distilles,
And inward comfort my whole senses thrilles
O may al such as are oppressed in mind,
The like relief in true repentance find.
The brazen gates no-sooner had I past,
When my whole burden on the green I cast,
Before the image, where I first had prayed,
And mindful of my former promise, said:
Mother of God, who do to none refuse
Mercy, unless thy mercyes they abuse,
Through thee I have this glorious sight obtained,
Not with a wicked eye to be prophand,
Through thee I Will glorifye my God, who saues
The sinner, which through thee his mercy craves:
What can a wretch say more? or more require?
Having from thee obtained her hearts desire:
It Is now my turn: blessed virgin: here I stand;
Ready t'obserue my vow, and thy command,
O teach me heauen's path, yet unknown, to tread,
And in the way of truth, thy pupil lead.
This said: as I was rising from my prayer,
A heavenly voice came through the open air,
Fly to the desert: there, sad soul repent,
Beyond the Jordan: there find true content.
My trembling knees on earth again I fold,
And out-stretcht hands to heauen's bright arches hold,
Alme virgin, lo, here once more, I abjure.
The world and sin: thou which art ever pure,
Mother, and maid: if gladly all I leave,
And naked, to thy dear protection cleave,
If readily I follow thy command,
O do not thou withdraw thy helping hand,
But thy poor creature guide, preserve, defend,
Til in thy son, my self and vows both end:
Here-with I rose: as I departed thence,
Some charitable man stopped three small pence
In to my hand: with which in have I bought
Three penny loafes, and by the baker taught
The way, to Jordan which I was to take,
With tears the holy city I forsake.
The failing sun, yet, with a ruddy light
I could see glimring on mount Carmel's height,
When to a little chapel of St. Ihon,
Ihon, holy Zachary'es more holy son,
Weary and weak I came: this chapel stood
Upon the banks of the desired flood,
There, as the sun even hid his sea-drencht beams,
Hands, face, and feet, I wash in living streams:
The night I spend in prayer, and with tears
Read the black legend of my sinful years:
Preparing my staind soul, with vnfaind grief,
The next day, to receive the food of life.
Just heavens be merciful: I know I went
Unworthily to this great sacrament,
O sacred manna, fountain of al good,
O deified bread, o angel's food,
Hide me in thy eternal mercyes, from
The dreadful justice of thy threatened doom:
Never sick soul presumd in house profane,
So glorious o ghest to entertain:
But oh unsearched treasures! boundless seas
Of mercyes and of goodness! when I cease
Thy mercyes and thy grace to magnify,
O let me without grace and mercy dye:
Never sick soul, so lame, and impotent,
So full of horrors, which durst yet present
I'ts naked inside, to that heavenly ghest,
Receaud' more comfort in this sacred feast,
Than I poor sinher: undeserved grace
Did never yet more amiably embrace,
A leaprous soul, restord' with angel's food,
And cleansed with my God's al-clensing blood:
The inward joy, and spiritual delight,
The peace of mind, and comfortable light;
Which (liberally infused from above)
Fierd my soul with everlasting love,
Were such, as should my words hope to deliver,
My words would wrong the bounty of the giver:
Alas how often, to solitude confind',
Have I since then, with holy hungar pind'
After this blessed food: how often distressed,
And with the weight of mine own woes oppressed,
Have I in agony, and hellish dread,
Sighed for the comfort of this heavenly bread:
How often in bitterness and drought of heart,
Have I aspird, but to some little part,
Of this oreflowing grace, this taste of heaven,
Now to a wretch so prodigally given:
Ah I deserud' it not, my sins were such,
Rather what then I had, was too too much,
Yet he who knows both when and how to give,
Will, when his pleasd', a famisht wretch relieve.
Oh father, might a sinner ever pray
With such full comfort, as I did that day,
How should we beat our sin's deserved pain,
Without which heavenly joys are hopd' in vain:
But I the time, in mine own passions spend,
Wronging your ear, which craves my story's end,
Yet as you see I can not well let pass
This pleasing memory so then I was
No less unwilling to forsake the place,
Wherein unworthy, I receaud' such grace.
From hence, about high noone, though loath I part,
More strong, more comforted, and light of heart,
Then ever I had been: prone on the banks
Of silver Jordan, I yield humblest thanks
To my great mistrisse, for I must to her
All favors what so ere and gifts refer,
Her son at her intreatye shall bestow,
For all through her that is given, to her I owe:
With tears I crave that she vouch safe t'abate
My God's just wrath, whom in such wretched state,
I had presumd', unworthy, to receive,
That he my faulty rashness would forgive,
Then in his late-tryed mercy^s confident,
My self and all to his heavenly will present.
My prayer ended: on the tufted grass
Earth's natif Carpet, half a loaf I place,
And sitting down on Iordan's flowery bed,
Praising the almighty's name, I eat my bread:
My htirst I quench in the vndamagd' flood,
For what I took in drink, my tears made good,
Contented with this sober fare I rise,
And to the orient sky couuert mine eyes,
Giving all thanks to him, who to all gives,
And with due food his creatures relieues:
That eve, and most part of that night, I spent
In prayer: the rest to careful slumbers lent:
Early next morning, ere the rising sun
Had from the east his daily course begun,
Watchful I rise my knees and heart I bow,
Weep, and reiterate my former vow,
And having to the glorious virgin prayed
More earnestly then ever, for her aid
In all my actions, til my soul inlargd'
From mortal fetters, had it is vows dischargd,
With constant purpose, never to forsake
The course, by her address I was to take,
Strait boating over the saint honored flood,
I hid me in this unfrequented wood:
From which time, ever flying, I have fled,
And this vast desart's depth inhabited,
Expecting him with love and fear, who saues
The humbled sinner, which, his mercy craves.
Here she concluded: he, whose ravished ears
Had seemd transported to th'harmonial speres,
Whiles she spoke sweeter music, now displeasd'
Those accents of her heavenly voice were ceasd',
Hoping a while, that of her self, she would
Some other passage of her life have told,
Stood mure: but silent shame with downe-cast eyes
Her aaged face in virtue's color dies,
At things her self had said: this he perceaues:
And thus with words, her of new words deceaues:
How long (o sainted sinner) is it since
These woods their first bliss borrowed, from thy sins.
Forty seven times: said she, the golden sun
Through the twelve signs it is complete race has run
For so often have I marked these trees left bare,
And their rich out sides nipt by the colder air.
As ost, (if this we reckon) have I seen
The fragrant spring restore their native green,
Since Sions holy city I forsook,
And penance in this desert undertook.
Zozim again; how have you liud' since then,
Whither relieud' by angels, or by men?
Have you in peace and without strife attaind
To this perfection's height, vnstopt, vnstraind:
Or have you felt the civil violence
Of lawless passions? reason against sense,
Will opposite to will, and rebel nature
In arms, against the laws of it is creator:
Has not that common foe, whose subtle slight
Some times transformes him to an angel bright,
Some times puts on the hydeous shape of fear,
With this t'amaze, with that the eyes to blear
Of weaker souls: with cunning and with force
Opposd' you in this solitary course?
For with such tricks it ever was his use
The desart's late improouers to seduce.
Th Aegiptian sighs, who in the fearfulst kind,
Had stood the utmost fury of the fiend,
Yet loath those fatal conflicts to renew,
From which she doubts fresh dangers might ensue,
Pale at their memory, and willing to
Forget thus sleights, what he desird' to know:
Tentations I had many, and those such,
I can not say too little, may too much.
Their memory is horror, and may yet
Breed danger, who is safe whom foes beset:
But for my food! o stay, here, Zozim cried,
With this halfe-answer not to be denied,
For thinking it the will of heaven, he should
Her wondrous life to aftertimes vnfold',
He would have al: ah whither is it you run
From that which you should most insist upon?
Weak of your self, if through heauen's ayding powrs
You have preuayld, the glory is not yours:
Secrets of kings we are warned to conceal,
But glorious it is God's wonders to reveal.
The sun burnd' saint (her eyes glazd' with fresh tears)
Made answer: for the space of seuenteen years,
Or there abouts, when to the silent shade
Of gloomy woods, my first retreat I made,
The raging monsters of vntamd' desyers
The light-wingd' furyes of my former fyers
Wasp-like, innumerous and busy swarms,
Frighted my restless soul with dire alarmes,
They roamd', they ragd', by day, by night obscure,
No time, no place, my prayers were secure:
Hot meats, where in our Aegipt much exceeds,
And bodies plumpt to sinful pleasures feeds,
Now represent themselves with all the store
Of law-lesse cates, which I had vsd' before,
Tempting with an unwilling, forced delight,
My still in-vaine-resisting appetite:
My blood-lesse veins with strong wines seemt to swell
Which I was wont to quaffe, as deep as Hell
In sinful healths: lascivious tunes deter
My even unwillingly attentive ear,
Whiles my too busy, and vnheed-ful tongue
Hummes the leaud parcels of some wanton song
To these both tears, and prayers, I oppose,
Batter my guilty breast with trebled blows,
Implore the aid of my great patroness
Whose succor never fayld me in distress,
For as it were even kneeling in the place
Where first I saw her image, my sad case
With tears I would expose: o happy they
Who to the mother of al mercy fly,
For whiles tears from mine eyes flowd, in full streams,
A heavenly light diffusd' in glorious beams
Would round incircle me secure my fears,
And change those streams of sorrows to glad tears:
But oh the snares, the unresisted charms,
The fierce assaults, th'vneuitable arms;
Wherewith soul lust, and actions vnnamd',
Ay me! my too proone memory inflamd,
When all those wanton pranckes of love, which I
In former times had acted willingly,
Presented now to my unwilling mind,
Each one, it is several face, it is several kind:
Then millions of chymera-like delights
Would throng in, with un heard of appetites,
And all lust's varyed shapes: a hydeous shoale,
None can paint sin but to a sinful soul:
Thrice happy ye, whose purer minds not know
Those tortures, which our sins are subject to,
Who in your state of innocence, secure,
Dream not, what our (once guilty) souls endure:
Mine yet with horror faints, even at the thought,
Mindful, how weakly thus assayld, it fought:
No flax, no sulphur, spreads more readily
The nimble flame, which heedlesse hands apply,
Then my prone senses, through sin's former use,
Like lightning, these impoysond thoughts diffuse,
My forced will it is assent in vain denies,
My soul melts in the flame, my marrow fryes,
I weep, when vrgd' with these inragd' desires,
But o no sea of tears can quench such fyers.
My boiling limbs I spread on the cold' ground,
Mine eyes and face in flowing sorrow drownd',
Thus in the pangs of mortal agonye,
Whole days, whole nights oftime, I grouelinglye,
Inuoking full of trust, her virgin aid,
Which never fayld' me, though some times delayed,
For from the dust I never rear my face,
(Vexed with such thoughts) til that clear beam of grace
It Is light of comfortable sweetness sheds,
And round about me glorious brightness spreads.
For then the enemy retyers dismayed,
Hot flames, and lust's abhord suggestions vade:
So when foul mists clogge Iordans silver flood,
The sun, cleard from some interposed cloud,
The foggy dampe disperses: and displayes
On the reflecting waves his brightest rays.
Full seuenteen years thus I afflicted lived,
Invaded by the foe, by her relieud,
So long when I had spent that little bread
Where of I spoke, on herbs and roots I fed,
Experience instructing me to choose
Such as the woods afforded, best for use:
So long: through th'alterd seasons of the year,
I sufferd much from the distemperd sphere,
In depth of winter, with cold mornings glac't,
With snowes, with sleetes, and storms of hayle defaced,
In summer tand', and scorcht with Titans beams,
My nakedness exposd to both extremes,
For those sheere weeds the moist and bleaker air
Had quickly rotted, which at first I ware:
From which time forward; naked as you see,
From soultry heat, from blashing winters free,
Clad in the mercyes of my God, in praise
Of his blessed name, I spend my waining days:
My soul which in these caves, heaven ayding, through
A thousand snares, has kept it is former vow,
Not ignorant, with what high favors graced,
Innumerable hazards it has past,
And trusting to that grace, by which repriud'
From these exterior troubles, it has liud',
Grows confident: and with inflamd' desires,
To euer-lasting comforts glad aspyres:
I drink, I feed, I Am clothd' out of heavens store,
The word of God all these supplies, and more,
Because that man on bread not only feeds,
But on each word which from our Lord proceeds,
Nay even the very rock shall them arraye,
Who the foul robe of sin have thrown away.
Th'attentiue father, when she had annexed
These places, picked out of the sacred text,
Demanded if she had been some times bred
In studyes, or the psalms perhaps had read:
Noe truly said she, nor have seen the face
Of mortal creature, in this forlorn place:
But be not this your wonder: for Gods word
Does sense and science to all his afford:
Lo father, now my whole life's tract you have,
And once again upon my knees I crave,
That in those holy offerings which you make
Daily to heaven, you some compassion take
Of my much-burdend' soul, and recommend
To that great God of mercyes my near end:
A deepe-fetcht sigh here closd' her speech: the man
Confounded kneeld', and with loud voice began,
His eyes in warm tears swimming: Blessed be
That God, by whom great things we compast see,
Strange high and wonderful, most dreadful things
Things which no scypher within number brings,
Blessed art thou, Lord, God almighty, who
Art pleasd' that I a sinful wretch should know
All those good things, which thou reseru'st in store
For them that love thee, who do evermore
Help them who seek thee: there th'Aegiptian takes
The oldman's hand, and raising him thus speaks:
Whiles I am living let no mortal ear
(O man of God) what I have told thee hear,
Touching my life and state: now go in peace,
And when the sun shall this same days increase
Add to the full year's period, you me,
And I shall you, God's grace assisting see,
Yet for Christ's sake, let me entreat, that you
When the next lent shall these blessed rites renew,
Though all the rest their annual custom keep,
In boating over Iordan's sacred deep,
Yet pass not with them: Zozim marking her
His monasteryes solemn rule tinferre,
With wonder shrinking, only said in's heart,
Glory to thee my God, who do impart
To them who love thee: she proceeded, stay
At home, as I was saying, nor obey
Thy rule here in, which would thou; know in vain
Man strives, when otherwise the heavens ordain:
Then on that ever honourd' day, in which
It pleasd' our lord his people to enrich
With the unvalued treasure of his blood,
And sacred body that life-giuing food.
Which, as his lou'es eternal testament,
By his last will; in this great sacrament
He left to his beloved: then I say,
When the declining sun shall close the day,
Having with due solemnity renewd'
The sacred cene do not my hopes delude,
But part of that celestial food reserve,
The worst of sinners, and most poor to serve:
This don, expect me on the farther side,
Where Iordan's streams the world and us divide,
That there once more I may receive the blood,
And body of my God, which sacred food
My famisht soul (since those blessed streams I past)
Has not been worthy in these woods to taste:
O father, though I know my self the worst
Of all that ever find, and most accursed,
Yet do not you a sinners prayer slight,
For heaven it self in such often takes delight,
Hear me, and grant, that I unworthy may
Receive my God, about that time of day,
Wherein it pleasd' himself to consecrate,
And give his last of suppers the first date,
Father be mindful of me, and farewell:
One thing I had forgotten: pray you tell
Your Abbot John: that some things are amiss
Which he should not neglect: but as for this
Say nothing for a while yet: tell him when
Our lord shall think it fit: forbear til then
Sh'had said, and kneeld for's blessing, which obtaind
With winged speed the thickest thickes she gaignd'.
The air receaues her on glad wings, the grass
Pressed lightly with her foot steps, as they pass
Forces to rise again (you would say) to meet
I'ts happiness, and kiss her sacred feet:
The woods haste to encounter their loud'ghest,
The leafes to whispering winds their ioys expressed,
And spread a thicker shadow, for they know
It is her will, that they should hide her so:
Things without sense exult, th'oldman alone,
Forsaken, and dejected, stands like one,
Whose high-contemplatiue transported soul
Wholly absorpt, and fixed in th'vpper pole,
Reard on the wings of pure eternal love,
Admire those treasures, which are stord' above
For true chaste lovers, and inioyes the place
Of endless bliss: alas, one minut's space
This high raysd' soul, to it is frail home retournes,
Where sad, dejected, and oppressed it mournes;
I'ts misery the greater, by how much
The late-tryed joys of heaven it had found such.
So stood the sad anachoret, depriud'
Of that blessed object, which had erst reuiud'
His death-likeage, whiles every word of hers
Pierced like sweet music his attentive ears,
Her countenance and illuminated face
Diffusing part of that redounding grace,
Which through the working of the holy ghost,
His neighboring soul with plenteous streams ingrost,
What joy might with that joy of his compare?
What mysery now equal his despair,
Since past felicityes but vex the more,
Than if they never had been known before.
His ey es pursue the saint, as far as he
Through the dim glasses of those eyes could see,
But when the spacious plain, and woods thick shade
His prospect's utmost period had made,
Lost in himself, he without motion stood
His eyes and soul both sinking in a flood
Of endless tears innumerable woes
Oppress him with their weight, and mortal throws
His straightened heart and bowels thrill: but when,
Weighing the varying state of mortal men,
He had reflected on his grief, and called
The will of God to mind: himself appalld'*
And fearful least he had offended in
His too rash sorrow, sorrows for his sin,
And rectifying his inferior will,
Vows that of heaven in all things to fulfill;
Then kneeling kissed the grass where she had stepped,
Which with observance dew, yet careful kept
The prints of her dear feet: and with calm showers
Waterd the drooping grass, and late-blest flowers.
But time calls on him, and himself restraines
His too prone will, to dwell on those sad plains
His hands with streaming eyes to heaven he liftes,
And magnifying his maker in his gifts,
Who had discouerd that rich mine of grace
To him sad sinner, homewards twines his face:
Much pondring her strict life, much her great merit,
But most the gift of that al-knowing spirit,
Which to her deiformed soul imparts
Thoughts hidden, and deep folds of mortal hearts.
It Was holy week: the fathers meet again,
To celebrate at home their yearly cene:
Which having solemnizd' in open quyer,
All silent, to their long-voyd celles retire.
Zozim at leisure here, begins to muse
Upon his late adventure, and renewes.
The memory of al things, as they past,
Her sins, her age, strict penance, and long fast:
Summons his senses, chiefly eyes and ears,
(For their free passage full impression bears
Both of her form and words) to lend him aid
Whiles his attentive soul a brief had made
Of all her words and graces: he the while,
At every tear of hirs, each little smile,
Makes a full period, reuiewes her face,
Each lineament thereof, each heavenly grace,
And of these parcells frames one perfect whole,
Which he ingraues deep, in his tender soul,
Nay now begins t'esteeme, and much to make
Of his own soul: even for the model's sake:
Pigmalion-like, but with a happyer flame,
Doting upon th'imaginary frame
Of his own brain: for wise, the whole referres
To that great workman, whose hand never erres,
Where it would goodness paint, nor can his s'kill
Fail him, whose pencil is his only will:
Nor wondreth Zozim now, that liberal heaven
Had such perfections to a creature given,
But mindful of the maker, learns to slight
The shallow and vnfinisht counterfeit,
Of that eternal prototype, which had
This rare piece to his own resemblance made,
Whose increated beauty he admires,
And happy, burns in more then mortal fyers.
Blessed sinner: whose sole memory can move
All creatures, to their great creators love:
So powerful is goodness, to whose flame,
None can approach, but must burn with the same:
The best effect of friendship, which to none,
But saints, nor even to these, is always known:
Thrice happy was our Zozimas to choose
So blessed a friend, but happyer in the use
He made thereof: for as all things appear
More great in her, through favor, then they were:
So through the glass of pious hatred, he
His own offenses trebled seems to see,
For by how much her worth he ouer-rates,
So much or more he of his own abates:
Much he admires her life, her goodness much,
But more himself blames, that he is not such:
Oh who not enuyes this his blessed state,
Happy to merit both by love and hate.
Hence he to such supreme perfection grows,
That it, itself with admiration shows,
To the whole closter, whiles he only blind,
Sees not that light, which in his own soul shind*
To the eyes of al men: and though he conceal
The cause thereof, the effects themselves reveal
In every act of his: nor rest'es it here,
Too great, to be confind: the spacious spear
Of one man's soul, too small to comprehend
So great a flame, is forced it self t'extend,
Dilating that resistlesse fire, which burns
Al objects near, and its own substance turns.
The convent now, or rather, every celle
Might seem a heaven, where blessed saints only dwell,
The elders mark with wonder-strocken eyes
Such reformation, without their advice,
And with more dew respects, learn to defer
To him, whose good examples powerful were
To make all others good: for none despairs
T'attaine to that perfection, which he shares:
The perfectest themselus more perfect grow,
And now, by more than speculation know,
That goodness in a creature, has no and,
Whence to a greater good it may not tend.
Whiles thus a heavenly life on earth they live,
And their thoughts wholly to perfection give,
Their ravished souls, fixed in a higher sphere,
Mark not the alterd seasons of the year,
Nor lower orbs, and ever poasting sun,
Which little less than his full race had run,
And by his absence left the colder clyme
Stormd' once more with long frosts (so swiftly time.
Runs with the saints, and in devotion spent)
Til warned now by near approaching lent,
And by long custom taught they ready made
To pass the Jordan, to the gloomy shade
Of unfrequented woods, the blessed aboades
Of living saints, and long since beaten roades
By elder Hermits: whiles the rest prepare
For their departure, Zozim's only care
Casts, how to keep touch with his saint-like friend,
Whom if he past the flood, he could not tend
As he had promised: gladly would do both,
And to infringe their statuts he is loath,
Nor would perhaps be sufferd: this his doubt
A fever clears, which ere the rest went out,
Forced him to lie, and at his bodye's cost,
His mind from scruple freed: his journey crossed:
Where now remembering, how she parting said,
Whither he would or not, he should be stayed,
Taught by experience, her words believes:
And at his own ^o slender faith much grieves:
Yet comforted in that he well-knowes, she
Who so long since this sickness could foresee,
Would not forget to pray for him: remits
All to the will of heaven: ere long, his fittes
Not causd' by any natural excess,
But by the hand of God himself, grew less,
And quickly left him free from al disease,
His mind and body both, in sweetest peace,
Expecting that, not long-deferd' delight,
Which both were to partake in her blessed sight.
The wished day breaks to his longing eyes,
He hastes to that unbloody sacrifice,
Which glads the heavens, and earth, the quick and dead,
And pixing part of that eternal bread,
Which mindful of his holy penitent,
He careful, had reserud' to this intent:
Down to the Jordan, swimming in glad tears,
His God and maker in his weak hands bears,
And full of hope, in the appointed place,
Expects to see her long-desired face,
Much wondering, that she was not yet arriud',
Much doubting, least himself had misconceiud'
The place agreed on, and begins to fear,
Least she had comd' before, and mist him there:
Then to his present God recurres for aid,
And prostrat on *his face, with fervor prayed:
My Lord and God, who this pure soul did frame,
To the eternal honor of thy name,
Since it was thy will, and ordinance divine,
That I at first, found this choice friend of thine,
Oh let me once more have the bliss to see
The creature, which has so much pleased thee:
Let me not frustrat of my hopes return,
My sins, my shame, and just repulse, to mourn
In empty celles: This said his watery eyes
Sends to the woods, alas those feeble spies
Return bad news: for having markt' the flood
It Is channel deep, betwixt them and the wood,
Propound a new doubt, not conceiud' before,
How she should pass unto the hither shore:
(No boat in sight) but this doubt's quickly cleard,
When she unto his hopeless eyes appeard,
Like to a new sun, rising on the strand:
And signing with her wonder-working hand
The smiling flood: begins to march thereon
As it were firm land: even as the blushing sun
Droopt' in the west, as shamd' to show his beams,
Whiles a more glorious sun shind' on those streams:
Yet at the wonder, he his head inclines
And with dew reverence his place resignes:
The waves the while more smooth and softly ^leet,
Playing soft music to her naked feet,
Which (forced by upper streams to part) they kiss,
And murmr, as robd' of their greatest bliss,
Yet least their stand might fright her, they restrain
Their own zeal, hasting gladly to the maine.
Zozim more senseless, then the senseless waves,
(For they were used to such wonders) raues,
And at the miracle amazed stands,
But as he would have kneeld upon the sands,
She now approaching to the hither side,
Thus with a loud voice, from the waters cried:
Father will you t'a creature kneel? forbear:
Who in your hands the al-creator bear:
The monk obayes, nor dare infringe her will,
Which the elements themselves joy to fulfill:
She landing kneeles, and kneeling humbly says
Bless me, o father, bless me: he displayes
His wondering hands to heaven: oh blessed be
Our God, the God of truth, whose works we see
Never belie his words: he promise made,
And verifyes in thee, what then he said,
That all such, as their souls from sin would clear,
Like to himself in greatness should appear:
Glory to thee my lord and savior, who
By this thine handmayd, have given me to know,
How far I was from true perfection, when
I thought my self (oh fool) the best of men.
But she whose famisht soul breaths purest fyers
Humbled in presence of her God, desyers
The father in his office to proceed,
Saying the Pater, and Apostles Creed:
With trembling hands, he warily unfolds
The sacred host: and to her full view holds:
Th'assisting angels to the place repair,
Commanding silence to the whispering air,
Which now affoardes but sparingly such breath
As might preserve the inhabitants from death:
Those blessed spirits with mild horrors shrink,
And at the presence of their maker sink
In love's abyss: admiring with glad shame,
A sinner's soul, fierd with a greater flame,
And more intense then theirs: whiles she with tears
Arming her breast, against it is pious fears,
Swimming in fervor, and love's sweetest sweetes,
With opend' mouth, her great redeemer meets:
The spheres stood still: whiles heaven and earth amazd,
With awful silence, and high wonder gazd'
Upon her ravished soul: all motions cease,
Fearful to interrupt her mind's sweet peace:
Whiles she possessed of her rich object feeds
On pleasure, which all words, al thought exceedes:
And now foreseeing her long-wished end
To be at hand: her thoughts with fervor tend
To joys eternal, and inspired tongue
Swan-like, repeats part of old Simeon's song:
Now thou thy servant do dismiss o Lord
In peace: according to thy blessed word.
For mine eyes* thy salvation have seen.
Here she brake of: and rising from the green
(Proud of it is burden) thus to Zozim spoke,
Yet father, I have one request to make,
Which you must not deny me: take the pains
A year hence, to reuisit those wild plains,
Where first we met: for by the old torrent, where
We held discourse together this last year,
You once again shall see me, if you please:
As it is long since decreed: now go in peace.
Can saints deceive then? how, her self knows well:
But pitying his just grief, forbears to tell:
Whiles he her words and meaning both mistakes,
And's greatest misery, his comfort makes:
With glad tears he replies: the heavens best know,
How willingly I now would with thee go,
And ever feed upon that soul of thine,
In which all things be heavenly, and divine:
But earth must not be heaven: yet ere I leave
Thy gracious sight, disdain not to receive
This slender portion: which said, he vncasd'
His little burden, and before her placd'
The choice of his provision: forth she stretched
Her humble hand, and to her blessed mouth reached
A grain or two of lentel, and no more,
For grace she said her food was, and best store.
But her high-mounting thoughts il brook delays,
And parting, she the doleful father prays,
Not to forget her wants: with streaming eyes,
He to her dear feet cleaues: and throbbing cries*
Pray for the holy church, the empire, and
For me, who most in need of your help stand:
Longer he would, but dares not, her detain,
Whom to importune, he knew it was in vain:
Loath he departs, ah little dreaming then,
Never to see those saintlike eyes again!
Whiles she makes haste back, to the longing wood,
Walking upon the once more happy flood.
Ah man what art thou? whose (tho God-like) mind
Yet reeles, and waves, with every little wind:
The worlds the tennis-court, thou art the ball,
Now with a lofty bound, now lowly fall,
Twixt chance and passion tossed: nor old, nor young,
Blessed with a settled fortune: never long,
Nor twice together pleasd': for following woes
Still with distaste thy few good minutes close.
If perfect men, even in ambitions which
Tend to sole goodness, passion can bewitch:
What may those wretches hope, whose love is sin,
Where shall their bad days end, or good begin?
There joy is misery: their best hopes Hell:
Where fetterd by their own base choice they dwell,
He whose high-flying soul breaths purest flames,
And only at eternal objects aims,
His heart in undeserved sorrow steepes,
And for a mortal creature's absence weeps,
Yet much at his own weakness he repines,
With multy-plyed acts his will resignes,
Labors against the stream, and strives in vain
Self-seeking sense, and nature to restrain,
For goodness no less powerful is to move,
Then beautye, either passion, or love:
Humbled, he ponders man's unsettled state,
And at his own much wonders, who so late
Did with such zeal to her blessed sight aspire.
Sorrow now springing from fullfilld' desire.
Hereby instructed, that man's spacious mind
Can not within frail circles be confind,
But as first from eternal orbs it came,
So nothing can content it but the same.
Home he retournes: and in a silent celle
Immutes those eyes, disdaining now to dwell
On earthly objects, having seen the best
Which that world's age could boast of, and most blessed:
There he his thoughts on joys eternal bent,
Often rectyfying his often crossed intent,
And when, his soul with heaviness oppressed,
Would some times interrupt his bodye's rest,
His thoughts he to the wilderness would send,
Wingd' messengers, to his all knowing friend,
Craving her prayers: not in fact does err,
Though much he seem t'a creature to defer,
And more mistake her dwelling: she his tears
Both sees, and pittyes, from the upper spheres,
More pious now then ever, and obtaines
The mind's peace he desired, and happy gains,
Not dreaming whence: whereby that year he spends
In comforts great, and still to greater tends.
The long-exspected day appeard at last,
When he not mindlesse of his promise, past
Over the Jordan, and with hasty pace,
The next way took to the appointed place;
Deluding hopes his boiling fancyes fire,
And all speed seems more slack, than his desire:
He runs, and running, thinks his feet but slow,
Not dreaming to what misery they go:
And who knows? would he say, but that she stays,
Expecting me, and for my coming prays,
For saints their longings have: it was true, he said:
She for their everlasting meeting prayed.
Arriud' he strait sends forth his busye spies,
Hoping to see those long-since-closed eyes,
Too bright for earth to look on: They by chance
In their return, upon a small cave glance,
Which in the maine rock, by no mortal taught
Nature, art's Mistrisse, curiously had wrought,
And in the native stone, had framd' a door:
Two lights above: beneath, a pummizd' flooer:
Stord' with a pleasant fountain, fruit, and shade,
Which to the spring a goodly palm tree made:
His heart with joy beats: and his willing feet
Run, their supposed happiness to meet:
For it was a place, which he (with reason) ghest,
Heaven had prepared, for such a heavenly guest.
Enterd, he finds her kneeling, with a face
Which yet retaind it is former zeal and grace:
Tho motion less, depriud' of sense and breath,
The sweetest picture that ere graced pale death,
Here first seen smiling: her i*oynd hands applied
T'a crucifix, which in the rocks maine side,
Her bodkin had (not without form) designd,
Tho much less perfect, than it, in her mind:
The monk admires her zeal, and loath to break
Her souls imagind' rapt, forbears to speak:
But his impatient ears grudge that delight,
(Bad counselors) which only blessed his sight,
And longing to enjoy her heavenly voice:
Their master urge, first, with some little noise
Of bootelesse sighs, then in a louder tone,
As from a soul much suffering, to groan:
All failing, to her keye-cold feet he creepes,
Where with good cause, tho yet unknown, he weeps:
Too hasty lips: ah whiles you kiss, you kill:
And guiltless heart, with deadly horrors thrill:
Yet lips may err: his hands must also feel
Those sacred soales, as cold, as stark as steel:
Stiff were her hands: her nostrils without breath:
All certain tokens of a certain death.
His sorrow is too great to find a vent,
With dry eyes on that doleful object bent,
He stands more senseless, than the senseless stone,
The growing rock had some life, he had none:
And life-lesse might to this day have remaind,
Had not her pure soul of her spouse obtaind',
That her bare corpse, exposd' to open view,
Might by his means, receive it is mortal dew:
Heaven his lost senses to their place restores,
And he his misery in words deplores,
Which no pen can express: but most he grieves,
That he expressly sent, as he believes,
To leave her story, and immortal fame
To aftertimes, had not inquired her name:
For it through chance, or rather hidden fate
He had forgot to ask, she to relate:
A new doubt, how to bury her, expelles
The former: and her blessed name reueales,
For whiles he seeks some tool, to break the ground,
Her name, her age, and dying day he found,
In Syrian characters scord' on the sand,
Either by angels, or her own pure hand:
Hereby he learnes, that she had closd' her days
Twelve whole months since: and yet would think she prays,
Such sweet devotion in her face appears,
And long-closd' lids, had he not mist their tears:
For their dried channels in her much worn face,
Were then first marked without those streams of grace;
This want, himself not sparingly, supplies,
But questionless would have wept out his eyes,
Had not a more grim object, and as near,
Restraind his grief, to make some room for fear.
A hydeous lion on his habit rubbes,
And trembling sides with harmless nostrils grubs,
Whiles he, now pale whith fear, amazed stands,
And stretches to the corpse his palsy hands,
Praying for help: the beast, with fyery eyes
The death pale saints, and the whole cave surueyes*
Then awfully his round walks, with a grace,
Might make him iudgd* of more than mortal race:
Til at the saint's feet, a full stop he makes,
And as himself so the whole cave he shakes.
The monks white hairs, with horror bristled, stand,
Whiles he his whole length stretch forth on the sand:
The rocks themselves with terror seem to sink,
And too weak, for so maine a burden, shrink:
The monster couch't his shaggy outside smoothes,
And dreadful paws, now mildly licking, soothes
The trembling father, with a fawning cheer,
Expelling part both of his grief, and fear:
Who taking heart, thus spoke: Thou king of beasts
Which never breaks thy maker's dreadful hests,
More blessed herein, than man: since his high will
Has sent the hither, in his name, ful-fill
Thy happy office, and dig out a grave,
T'interre this sacred corpse in it is own ca^e:
The beast with fury flies to work, and tears
The ground up with his dreadful claws: new fears
Assail the monk's heart, least some sparkling stone
Should maime the sacred carcass, or his own;
So fiercely he, earth's craggy entralls riues,
And round about the little parlor drives;
Yet wary in his fury, ever keeps
That compass harmless, where the blessed saint sleeps*
His panting sides with his own steer he beats
Breaths fire, and ruin to the whole rock threats.
His shaggy fle^^ waves with his angry wind,
And stares, with horror quilted: he inclind
Close to his task, both with his teeth, and claws,
The harder crags breaks: lighter mold with draws:
And now interred in his own work he lies,
Yet still works on: enough, the father cries:
His furious labors in an instant cease,
And he by Zozim blessed departs in peace:
Whiles the sad monk in streams of sorrow fleets,
And her cold limbs in his own mantel sheets.
All rites performd, the sacred corse he rears
With due respect, and to it is mansion bears,
Where once more, at her blessed feet he fell,
Kissed them, and weeping took his last farewell:
First throwing in the sand, and lighter mold,
Then shiuerd crags, and bigger stones he rold',
Of which, upon her arms and sacred breast,
The figure of a homely cross he dressed:
And paying the last tribut of his tears,
Retournes to his own celle: where full of years,
And sanctitye, whiles her strange life he writes,
She him to everlasting joys inuites:
His soul to heaven, his bones to earth return,
And peacefully rest in their native vrne.
Blessed pair of saints: to whose al honored shrines
My black muse adds these late recanting lines,
Mildly accept of her unfeigned zeal,
And by your prayers, strengthen mine appeal
From that of justice, to sweet mercy's throne,
Most blessed of sinners, not to thee unknown:
Mercy it self can not show more divine,
Than by remitting greater sins than thine.
Disdain not therefore to prepare a place,
For my staind soul* great sins requyer great grace.
And mercy calls on mercyes: be my guide
To those great mercyes which thy self have tried:
That there thy praise I may for ever sing,
(A laureld poet) to a happyer string.
Amen. Deo gratias.
