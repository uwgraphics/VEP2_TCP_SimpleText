HIS MAJESTY'S LEPANTO, Or, HEROICAL SONG, being part of his Poetical
exercises at vacant hours.

Imprinted at London by Simon Stafford, and Henry Hook. 1603.

THE AUTHORS Preface to the Reader,
IT falls out often, that the effects of men's actions comes clean contrary to
the intent of the Author. The same find I by experience (beloved Reader) in my
Poem of Lepanto: For although till now, it have not been imprinted, yet being
set out to the public view of many, by a great sort of stolen copies, purchased
(in truth) without my knowledge or consent, it has for lack of a Preface, been
in some things misconstrued by sundry, which I of very purpose thinking to have
omitted, for that the writing thereof might have tended, in my opinion, to some
reproach of the skilful learnednes of the Reader, as if his brains could not
have conceived so vncurious a work, without some manner of commentary, and so
have made the work more displeasant unto him: it has by the contrary fallen
out, that the lack thereof has made it the more displeasa^t to some, through
their mistaking a part of the meaning thereof. And for that I know the special
thing misliked in it, is, that I should seem far contrary to my degree and
Religion, like a mercenarie Poet, to pen a work, ex professo, in praise of a
foreign Papist hastard; I will, by setting down the nature and order of the
Poem, resclue the ignorant of their error, and make the other sort inexcusable
of their captiousnes. The nature then of this Poem, is an argument, a minore
ad maius, largely entreated by a Poetike comparison, being to the writing
hereof moved, by the stirring up of the league and cruel persecution of the
Protestants in all countries, at the very first raging whereof, I compiled this
Poem, as the exhortation to the persecuted in the hinmost eight lines thereof
does plainly testify, being both begun and ended in the same Summer, wherein
the league was published in France. The order of the Cantique is this: First,
a Poetike preface, declaring the matter I treat of, wherein, I* name not
Don-Iohn, neither literally nor any ways by description, which I behooved to
have done, if I had penned the whole Poem in his praise, as Virgil, Arma
virumque cano: and Homer, Dic mihi musa virum: of whose imitation I had not
been ashamed, if so my purpose had been framed. Next follows my invocation to
the true God only, and not to all the He and She Saints, for whose vain
honors, Don-Iohn fought in all his wars. Next after my invocation, follows the
poetike History of my comparison, wherein following forth the ground of a true
history, (as Virgil or Homer did) like a painter shadowing with vmbers a
portrait else drawn in gross, for giving it greater viuenes, so I eike or
pair to the circumstances of the actions, as the rules of the poetike art
will permit: which historike comparison continues till the song of the Angels:
in the which I compare and apply the former comparison to our present estate,
taking occasion thereupon to speak somewhat of our religion. Lastly, the
Epilogue of the whole, in the last eight lines, declares fully my intention in
the whole, and explaines so fully my comparison and argument, from the more to
the less, as I cannot without shameful repetition speak any more thereof. And
in a word, what soever praise I have given to Don-Iohn in this Poem, it is
neither in accounting him as first or second cause of that victory, but only
as a particular man, when he falls in my way, to speak the truth of him. For
as it becomes not the honor of my estate, like an hireling, to pen the praise
of any man: So becomes it far less the highness of my rank and calling, to
spare for the fear or favor of whomsoever living, to speak or write the
truth of any. And thus craving pardon, beloved Reader, for this long some
Apology (being driven thereto, not by nature, but by necessity) I bid you
heartily farewell.

THE SONNET.
THe azur'd vault, the cristall circles bright,
The gleaming fiery torches powdered there,
The changing round, the shining beamy light,
The sad and bearded fyres, the monsters fair:
The prodigies appearing in the air,
The rearding thunders, and the blustering winds,
The fowls, in hew, in shape, and nature rayre,
The pretty notes that winged musicians finds:
In earth the sau'ry flowers, the mettal'd minds,
The wholesome herbs, the haughty pleasant trees,
The silver streams, the beasts of sundry kinds,
The bounded roares, and fishes of the seas:
All these for teaching man, the LORD did frame,
To do his will, whose glory shines in them.

HIS MAJESTY'S LEPANTO: OR, HEROICAL SONG.
I Sing a wondrous work of God,
I sing his mercies great,
I sing his justice here -- withal
Powered from his holy seat:
To wit, a cruel Martial war,
A bloody battle bold,
Long doubtsome fight, with slaughter huge,
And wounded manifold.
Which fought was in LEPANTOES gulf,
Betwixt the baptized race,
And circumcised Turband Turks
Rencountring in that place.
O only God, I pray thee thrice,
Thrice one in persons three,
Alike Eternal, like of might,
Although distinct ye be.
I pray thee Father, through thy Son,
Thy word immortal still,
The great ARCHANGELL of records,
And worker of thy will,
To make thy holy Spreit my Muse,
And eik my pen inflame,
Above my skill to write this work,
To magnify thy name.
Into the turning still of times,
I err, no time can be,
Where was and is, and times to come,
Confounded are all three:
I mean, before great God in Heaven,
(For Sun and Moon deuides
The times in earth by hours and days,
And seasons still that slides.)
Yet Man, whom Man must understand,
Must speak into this case,
As man; our flesh will not permit,
We heavenly things embrace.
Then, as I else began to say,
One day it did fall out,
As glorious God in glistering throne,
With Angels round about
Did sit, and Christ at his right hand,
That crafty Satan came,
Deceyuer, Liar, hating man,
And Gods most sacred Name.
This old abuser stood into
The presence of the Lord:
Then in this manner Christ accus'de
The sower of discord:
I know, thou from that City come,
CONSTANTINOPLE great,
Where thou have by thy malice made
The faythlesse Turks to freat:
Thou have inflamde their maddest minds
With raging fire of wraith,
Against them all that do profess
My Name with fervent faith.
How long, O Father, shall they thus,
Quite under foot be tred,
By faythlesse folks, who executes
What in this Snake is bred!
Then Satan answered, Faith? Quoth he,
Their Faith is too too small;
They strive, me think, on either part,
Who farthest back can fall:
Have thou not given them in my hands,
Even both the sides, I say,
That I, as best does seem to me,
May use them every way?
Then IEHOVA, whose nod does make
The heavens and mountains quake,
Whose smallest wrath the Centers makes
Of all the Earth to shake;
Whose word did make the world of naught,
And whose approouing syne
Did stablish all, even as we see,
By force of voice divine:
This God began from thundering throat
Grave words of wayght to bring:
All Christians serve my son, though not
Aright in every thing.
No more shall now these Christians be
With Infidels oppressed,
So of my holy hallowed Name
The force is great and blessed
Desist o Tempter. Gabriel, come,
O thou ARCHANGEL true,
Whom I have often in message sent
To Realms and Towns anew.
Go quickly hence to Venice Town,
And put into their minds,
To take revenge of wrongs the Turks
Have done in sundry kinds.
No whisling wind with such a speed,
From hills can hurl ore heugh,
As he whose thought does furnish speed,
His thought was speed aneugh.
This Town it stands within the Sea,
Five miles or thereabout,
Upon no I Will nor ground, the Sea
Runs all the streets throughout,
Who stood upon the steeple head,
Should see a wondrous sight,
A Town to stand without a ground,
Her ground is made by slight:
Strong Timber props dung in the Sea
Do bear her up by art,
An I Will is all her marketplace,
A large and spacious part.
A Duke with Senate joined does rule,
Saint MARK is patron chief,
Ilk year they wedde the Sea with rings
To be their sure relief.
The Angel then arrived into
This artificial Town,
And changed in likeness of a man,
He walks both up and down,
While time he met some man of spreit,
And then began to say,
What do we all? me think we sleep:
Are we not day by day*
By cruel Turks and Infidels
Most spitefully oppressed?
They kill our Knights, they brash our forts.
They let us never rest.
Go too, go too, once make a proof:
No more let us desist:
To bold attempts God gives success,
If once assay we list.
With this he goes away. This man
Unto an other tells
The purpose, whereunto they both
Agree among themsels.
This other to an other tells,
And so from hand to hand
It spreads and goes, and all that heard
It, necessare it fand.
And last of all it comes unto
The Duke and Senates care,
Who found it good, and followed forth
The same as ye shall hear.
The Town was driven into this time,
In such a pitteous strait
By Mahometists, that they had else
Given over all debait.
The Turk had conquest Cyprus I Will,
And all their lands that lay
Without the bounds of Italy,
Almost the whole, I say:
And they for last refuge of all,
Had moved each Christian King,
To make their Churches pray for their
Relief in every thing.
The Town with pitteous plaints did call
Upon the Lord of might,
With praying still and fasting often,
And groaning all the night:
Was nothing heard but sobs and sighs,
Was nothing seen but tears,
Yea sorrow drove the brauest men
With mourning to their bears.
The women swound for sorrow often,
The babe for woe did weep,
To see the mother giving milk,
Such doleful gesture keep.
Young men and maids within the Town
Were ay arraid in black,
Each Eau'n the Sun was sooner hid
Then erst, the night to macke.
No Venus then, nor Cupid false,
Durst kyth or once appear,
For pale distress had banished them,
By sad and sorry cheer.
As seas did compass them about,
As Seas the streets did rin,
So Seas of tears did ever flow
The houses all within.
As Seas within were joined with howles,
So Seas without did rayre,
Their careful cries to Heaven did mount,
Resounding in the air.
O stay, my Muse, thou go too far:
Show where we left before,
Lest trickling tears so fill my pen,
That it will write no more.
Then VENICE being in this state,
When Gabriel there was sent,
His speeches spread abroad, made Town
And Senate both so bent
To take revenge, as they implorde
The Christian Princes aid,
Of forces such, as easily,
They might have spared and may'd.
At last, support was granted them,
The holy league was past,
Als long to stand, as twixt the Turks
And Christians war should last.
It was agreed, that into March,
Or April every year,
The army should on Eastern Seas,
Conuene from far and near.
Thus bent upon their enterprise,
The principals did conueene,
Into Messena to consult,
What order should have been
Observed in all their army great:
There Don John d' Austria came,
Their General great, and Venier als
Came there in Venice name*
From Genes Andrea Dor^^ came,
And Rome Colonne sent,
When they with others many days
Had into counsel spent.
In end Ascagnio Dela Corn,
A martial man and wise,
His counsel gave, as ye shall hear
Upon their enterprise.
Three causes be (o chieftaynes brave)
That should a General let,
On Fortunes light uncertain wheel
The victory to set:
First, if the loss may harm him more,
Then winning can avail,
As if his Realm he do defend
From them that it assail.
The next, is when the contrare Host
Is able to divide,
For sickness sore, or famine great,
Then best is to abide.
The third and last, it is in case
His forces be too small,
Then better far is to delay,
Then for to per^^^ all.
But since of these two former points
We need not stand in doubt,
Then though we leese, we may defend
Our Countries round about.
As to the last, this army is
So awful, strong and fair,
And furnished so with necessares
Through your foreseeing care,
That naught does rest but courage bold.
Then since your state is such,
With trust in God assay your chance.
Good cause avails much.
But specially take heed to this,
That ere ye make away,
Ye order all concerning watre,
Into their due array:
For if while that ye see your foes,
Ye shall continue all,
Then shall their sudden sight with fear
Your brauest Spreits appall.
Each one command a sundry thing,
Astonished of the case,
And every simple Soldat shall
Usurp his Captains place.
This counsall so contents them all,
That every man departs,
With whispering much, and so resolves
With bold magnanime hearts.
THEIR preparations being made,
They all upon a day,
Their biting Ankers gladly wayde,
And made them for the way.
The Grecian Fleet, for Helens cause
That Neptunes town did sack,
In brave array, or glistring arms,
No match to them could macke.
There came eight thousand Spaniards brave
From hot and barren Spain,
Good ordour-keepars, cold in fight,
With proud disdaynfull brain,
From pleasant fertile Italy,
There came twelve thousand als,
With subtle spreits bent to revenge,
By crafty means and falls.
Three thousand Almans also came,
From Countries cold and wide,
These money men with awful cheer
The chock will dourely bide.
From diverse parts did also come,
Three thousand venturers brave,
All voluntaires of conscience moved,
And would no wages have.
Armde Galleyes twice a hundr'and eight,
Six ships all wondrous great,
And five and twenty loadned ships,
With baggage, and with meat;
With forty other little barks,
And pretty Galeots small.
Of these aforesaid was compound
The Christian Navy all.
THIS cloud of Galleys thus began
On Neptunes back to row:
And in the ships the Mariners
Did skippe from towe to towe.
With willing minds they hayld the Ties,
And hoyst the flaffing Sails,
And strongest towes, from highest mastes,
With force and practique hayles.
The Forceats lothsomly did row,
In Galleys against their will,
Whom Galley-masters often did beat,
And threaten ever still.
The foming Seas did bullor up,
The risking Oars did rash,
The Souldats pieces for to clenge
Did showers of shots delash.
But as the Devil is ready bent,
Good works to hinder ay,
So sowd he in this Navy strife,
Their good success to stay.
Yet did the wisdoms of the Chiefes,
And of the general most,
Compound all quarrels and debates
That were, into that Host,
Preferring wisely as they ought,
The honor of the Lord,
Unto their own, the public cause,
To private men's discord.
The feathered fame of wondrous speed.
That does delight to flee
On tops of houses prattling all
That she can hear or see,
Part true, part false: this monster strange
Among the Turks did tell,
That diverse Christian Princes joined,
Resolved with them to mel.
Then spies were sent abroad, who told
The matter as it stood.
Except in Arythmetique (as
It seemd) they were not good:
For they did count their number, to
Be less then was indeed,
Which did into the great Turks mind
A great disdayning breed.
A perrilous thing, as ever came
Into a Chieftaynes brain,
To set at naught his foes (though small)
By lighleing disdain.
Then Selym sent a Navy out,
Who wandered without rest,
Whill time into LEPANTOES gulf,
They all their Ankers kest.
In season when with sharpest hooks
The busy shearers cow
The fruitful yellow locks of gold,
That do on Ceres grow,
And when the strongest Trees for weight
Of birth do downward bow
Their heavy heads, whose colored knops
In showers rain ripely now,
And husband men with Woodbind crowns,
To twice borne Bacchus dance,
Whose pleasant poison sweet in taste,
Does cast them in a trance:
Into this riping season sure,
The Christian Host, I say,
Were all assembled for to make
Them ready for the way.
But or they from Messena came,
The Vines were standing bayre,
Trees void of fruit, and Ceres polde,
And lacking all her hair:
But when that leaves, with rattling falls
In banks of withered boughs,
And careful laborers do begin
To yoke the paynefull ploughes,
The Nauies near to other drew,
And Venier (sent before)
Gave false Alarm, sending word,
The Turks had skowp'd the score,
That fifty Gallyes quite were fled.
This word he sent express,
To make the Christians willingly
To battle them address.
As so they did, and entered all,
(Moved by that samin flight)
Into LEPANTOES gulf, and there
Preparde them for the fight.
Whill this was doing here on earth,
Great God, who creates all,
(With wakrife eye preordoning
What ever does befall)
Was sitting in his pompous throne,
In highest heaven above,
And gloriously accompanide
With Justice and with Love:
The one has smiling countenance,
The other frowning cheer:
The one to mercy still persuades
Him as a Father dear:
The other for to power his plagues
Upon repining sin,
And fill the fields with woeful cries,
The houses all with dinne.
But yet the Lord so temperates them,
That both do brook their place,
For Justice whiles obtaynes her will,
But evermore does grace:
IEHOVA als has balances,
Wherewith he weighes aright
The greatest and the heauiest sins
With smaller faults and light:
These grace did move him for to take:
And so he weighed in heaven
The Christian faults, with faithless Turks.
The balance stood not eauen,
But sweyd upon the faythlesse side.
And then with awful face,
Frownd God of Hosts, the whirling heavens
For fear did tremble space.
The stayest mountains shuddred all,
The grounds of earth did shake,
The Seas did bray, and Plutoes Realm*
For horror cold did quake.
HOW soon Aur^raes joyful face
Had shead the shady night,
And made the chiuering Larks to sing
For gladness of the light,
And Phoebe with inconstant face,
In Seas had gone to rest,
And Phoebus chasing vapors moist,
The Sky made blew celest;
The General of the Christian Host,
Upon his Galley Mast,
The bloody sign of furious Mars,
Made to be fixed fast.
Then, as into a spacious town,
At breaking of the day,
The busy worke-men do prepare
Their Worklumes every way.
The Wright does sharp his hacking Axe,
The Smith his grinding File,
Glasse-makers beets their fire that burns
Continual, not a while:
The Paynter mixes colors viue,
The Printer Letters sets,
The Mason clinks on Marble stones,
Which hardly dressed he gets:
Even so, how soon this Warrior world
With earnest eyes did see
Yon sign of war, they all preparde
To win or else to dye:
Here Hagbutters prepared with speed
A number of Bullets round;
There Cannoners, their Cannons steild,
To make destroying sound;
Here Knights did dight their burnisht brands,
Their Archers bows did bend,
The Armorers on Corslets knocked,
And Harness hard did mend,
The fiery Mariners at once
Made all their tackling claire
With whispering dinne, and cries confused,
Preparing here and there:
As busy Bees within their Hiues
With murmuring ever still,
Are earn'st upon their fruitful work,
Their empty holes to fill.
The Flags and Ensigns were displayed,
At Zephyrs will to wave,
Each painted in the colors clear
Of every owner brave.
But all this time, in careful mind
The General ever rolde,
What manner of array would best
Fit such an army bold.
To pance on this it paynd him more,
This more did trouble his breast,
Then Cannons, Cor^e-lets, Bullets, Tackle,
And Swords, and Bows, the rest.
And at the last with ripe advice,
Of Chieftaynes sage and grave,
He shead in three, in Cressents form,
This martial army brave:
The General in the battle was,
And Colonel undertook
The right wing with the force of Genes,
The left did Venier brook.
WHEN this was done, the Spanish Prince
Did row about them all,
And on the names of special men,
With loving speech did call,
Remembering them how righteous was
Their quarrel, and how good,
Immortal praise, and infinite gaynes,
To conquer with their blood;
And that the glory of God in earth,
Into their manhead stands,
Through just relief of Christian souls
From cruel Pagans hands.
But if the Enemy triumphed
Of them and of their fame,
In millions men to bondage would,
Professing JESUS name,
The Spaniol Prince exhorting thus
With glad and smiling cheer,
With sugared words and gesture good,
So pleased both eye and ear,
That every man cried victory.
This word abroad they blew,
A good presage that victory
Thereafter should ensew.
The Turquish Host in manner like
Themselves they did array,
The which two Bashas did command
And order every way.
For Portan Basha had in charge,
To govern all by land,
And Ali-Basha had by Sea
The only chief command,
These Bashas in the battle were,
With mo then I can tell,
And Mahomet Bey the right wing had,
The left Ochiali fell.
Then Ali-Basha visied all
With bold and manly face,
Whose tongue did utter courage more
Then had alluring grace:
He did recount amongst the rest,
What victory Turks obtaind
On caytife Christians, and how long
The Ottomans race had raignd:
He told them als, how long themselves
Had victours ever been,
Even of these same three Princes small,
That now durst so conuene.
And would ye then give such a lie
Unto your glories past,
As let your selves be overthrown
By loosers at the last?
This victory shall Europe make
To be your conquest pray,
And all the rare things therein till,
Ye carry shall away:
But if ye leese, remember well
How ye have made them thrall,
This samin way, or worse shall they
Demayne you one and all,
And then shall all your honors past,
In smoke euanish quite,
And all your pleasures turn in pain,
In dolor your delight:
Take courage then, and boldly to it,
Our Mahomet will aid,
Conducting all your shots and strokes
Of arrowe, dart, and blayd:
For nothing care, but only one,
Which only does me fray,
That ere with them we ever meet,
For fear they flee away.
This speech did so the Army please,
And so their minds did move,
That clinks of Swords, and rattle of Pikes,
His speeches did approve.
THE glistring clear of shining Sun
Made both the Hosts so glaunce,
As fishes eyes did reele to see.
Such hewes on Seas to dance:
But Titan shinde on eyes of Turks,
And on the Christians backs,
Although the wavering wind, the which
But seldom settling tacks,
The Turks did second ever still,
Whill but a little space
Before the chocke, o miracle!
It turned into their face:
Which Christians joyful as a s^ale
And token did receive,
That God of Hosts had promised them,
They victory should have.
HOW soon a Cannons smoaky throat
The Seas did dindle all,
And on Bellona bold and wise,
And bloody Mars did call,
And that the sounding clear of brass,
Did als approve the same,
And kindled courage into men,
To win immortal fame.
But what? Me think I do intend
This battle to recite,
And what by Martial force was done,
My pen presumes to write,
As if I had yon bloody God,
And all his power seen,
Yea to descriue the God of Hosts,
My pen had able been:
No, no: no man that witness was,
Can set it out aright.
Then how can I by hearsay do,
Which none could do by sight?
But since I rashly took in hand,
I must assay it now,
With hope that this my good intent
Ye Readers will allow:
I also trust, that even as he
Who in the Sun does walk,
Is colored by the samin Sun,
So shall my following talk,
Some savor keep of Martial acts,
Since I would paint them out,
And God shall to his honor als
My pen guide out of doubt.
This warning given to Christians, they
With Turks yoke here and there,
And first the six aforesaid ships,
That were so large and fair,
And placed were in former ranks,
Did first of all pursew
With Bullets, Raisers, Chains, and nails,
That from their pieces flew:
Their Cannons rummisht all at once,
Whose mortal thudding drove
The fatal Turks, to be content
With Thetis for their grave.
The Fishes were astonished all,
To hear such hideous sound,
The Azure sky was dimmed with smoke:
The dinne that did abound,
Like thunder rearding rumling rave
With roares the highest Heaven,
And pearst with pith the glistring vaults
Of all the Plannets seven:
The piteous plaints, the hideous howles,
The grievous cries and mones,
Of millions wounded sundry ways,
But dying all at ones,
Conioynd with former horrible sound,
Distemperd all the air,
And made the Seas for terror shake
With braying ever where:
Yet all these unacquainted roares,
The fearful threatening sound,
Joined with the groaning murmuring howles,
The courage could not wound
So far of Turkish Chieftaynes brave,
As them to let or fray,
With boldest speed their grievous harms
With like for to repay,
Who made their Cannons bray so fast,
And Hagbuts crack so thick,
As Christians dead in number almost
Did counteruayle the quick,
And sent full many carcages
Of Seas to lowest ground,
The Cannons thuds and cries of men
Did in the sky resound,
But Turks remaynd not long unpaid
Even with their proper coin,
By bitter shots, which Christians did
To former thundering join:
Dead dropped they down on every side,
Their sighing Spreits eschewes,
And crosses Sty^ into disdain,
To hear infernal news:
Yea scarcely could the ancient boat
Such number of souls contain,
But sobbed underneath the weight
Of Passengers profane.
While here the Father stood with Son,
A whirling round does bear
The lead that dings the Father in dross,
And fills the Son with fear;
Whill there a Chieftayne shrilly cries,
And Soldats does command,
A speedy Pellet stops his speech,
And stays his poynting hand*
Whill time a clustered troop does stand
Amazed together all,
A fatal Bullet them among,
Makes some selected fall:
The hideous noise so deaf'd them all,
Increasing ever still,
That ready Soldats could not hear
Their wise Commanders will;
But every man as Mars him moved,
And as occasion served,
His duty did, the best he might,
And for no peril sweru'd:
Their old Commanders precepts past
They put in practice then,
And only memory did command
That multitude of men.
THVS after they with Cannons had
Their duty done afar,
And time in end had wearied them
Of such embassad war,
A rude recounter then they made,
Together Galleys clipped,
And each one other rasht her nose,
That in the Sea was dipped:
No manner of man was idle then,
Each man his arms did use:
No scaping place is in the Seas,
Though men would Mars refuse:
The valiant Knight with Coutlasse sharp,
Of fighting foe does part
The bloody head from body pale,
Whill one with deadly dart
Does pearce his enemies heart in twain,
Another fearce does strike
Quite through his fellows arm or leg,
With poynted brangling Pike.
The Cannons leave not thundering of,
Nor Hagbuts shooting still,
And seldom Powder wastes in vain,
But either wound or kill:
Yea even the simple forceats fought
With beggars bolts anew,
Wherewith full many principal men,
They wounded sore and slew;
Whill time a Christian with a sword,
Lets out a faythlesse breath,
A Turk on him does with a dart
Revenge his fellows death,
Whill time a Turk with arrow does
Shoot through a Christians arm,
A Christian with a Pike does pearce
The hand that did the harm:
Whill time a Christian Cannon killes
A Turk with threatening sound,
A Hagbut hits the Cannoner,
Who dead, falls to the ground:
The beggars bolts by forceats casten,
On all hands made to fly,
Iaw-bones and brains of killed and hurt,
Who wished (for pain) to dye.
The clinks of swords, the rattle of Pikes,
The whirre of arrows light,
The howles of hurt, the Captains cries
In vain, do what they might:
The cracks of Galleyes broken and bruz'd,
Of Gunnes the rumbling bear
Resounded so, that though the Lord
Had thundered, none could hear.
The Sea was vernish'd red with blood,
And fishes poisoned all,
As Iehoua by Moses rod,
In Egypt made befall.
THIS cruel fight continued thus
Uncertain all the while:
For Fortune often on either side
Did frown, and after smile.
It seemed that Mars and Pallas both
Did think the day too short,
With bloody practice thus to use
Their old acquainted sport:
For as the slaughter ay increast,
So did the courage still
Of martial men, whom loss of friends
Enarm'd with eigre will;
The more their number did decrease,
The more that they were harmd,
The more with Mars then were they filled
With boldning spite inarm'd:
Now up, now down on either side,
Now Christians seemd to win,
Now overthrown, and now again,
They seemd but to begin.
My pen for pity cannot write,
My hair for horror stands,
To think how many Christians there
Were killed by Pagane hands.
O Lord, throughout this Labyrinth
Make me the way to view,
And let thy holy threefold Sprcit
Be my conducting clew.
O now I spy a blessed Heaven,
Our landing is not far:
Lo, good victorious tidings comes,
To end this cruel war.
IN all the time that thus they fought,
The Spanish Prince was clipped
With Ali-Basha, whom to meet,
The rest he had oreslipt,
And even as throughout both the Hosts,
Dame Fortune varied still,
So kythde she twixt those Champions two,
Her fond inconstant win:
For after that the Castles four
Of Galleys both, with found,
And slaughter huge, their Bullets had
In other made rebound,
And all the small Artillery,
Consumde their shots below,
In killing men, or else to cut
Some Cable strong, or Towe:
Yet victory still uncertain was,
And Soldats never ceast
(With interchange of Pikes and Darts,)
To kill or wound at least.
In end, when they with blood abroad,
Had bought their meeting dear,
The victory first on Spanish side
Began for to appear:
For even the Spanish Prince himself
Did hazard at the last,
Accompanied with boldest men,
Who followd on him fast,
By force to win the Turkish deck,
The which he did obtain,
And entered in their Galley syne,
But did not long remain:
For Ali-Basha proved so well,
With his assisters brave,
That backward faster then they came
Their valiant foes they drove,
That glad they were to escape themselves,
And leave behind anew
Of valiant fellows carcases,
Whom thus their enemies slew.
The General boldned then with spite,
And vernisht red with shame,
Did rather choose to leese his life,
Then time his spreading fame:
And so of new encouraged
His Soldiers true and bold,
As now for eigrenesse they burn,
Who erst were waxed cold:
And thus they entered in again,
More fiercely then before,
Whose rude assault could Ali then
Resist not any more,
But fled unto the Fort at STEVIN,
For last refuge of all,
Abiding in a doubtsome fear,
The chance he did befall.
A Macedonian Soldier then,
Great honor for to win,
Before the rest in earnest hope,
To Basha bold did rin,
And with a Cutlace sharp and fine,
Did whip me off his head,
Who lackt not his reward of him
That did the Navy lead:
The General syne caused fix the head
Upon his Galley Mast.
At sight whereof, the faythlesse Host*
Were all so sore aghast,
That all amazed gave back at once,
But yet were stayed again,
And never one at all did escape,
But taken were or slain,
Ochiali except, with three times ten
Great Galleyes of his own,
And many of the Knights of MALT,
Whom he had overthrown:
But if that he with his conuoy
Had mist a safe retreat,
No news had SELYM but by brute,
Heard ever of this defeat.
WHEN thus the victory was obtaynd,
And thanks were given to God,
Twelve thousand Christians counted were,
Releeu'd from Turquish rod.
O Spanish Prince, whom of a glance
And suddenly away
The cruel fates gave to the world,
Not suffering thee to stay!
With this the still night sad and black
The earth oreshadowed then,
Who Morpheus brought with her and rest,
To steal on beasts and men.
BUT all this time was Venice Town
Reuoluing what event
Might come of this prepared fight,
With doubtsome minds and bent:
They longed, and yet they durst not long,
To hear the news of all:
They hoped good, they feared the evil,
And kest what might befall.
At last the joyful tidings came,
Which such a gladness bred,
That Matrons grave, and Mayds modest,
The market place bespred:
Anon with cheerful countenance
They dress them in a ring,
And thus the foremost did begin
Syne all the rest to sing.
Chorus Venetus.
SIng praise to God both young and old,
That in this town remain,
With voice, and every Instrument,
Found out by mortal brain:
Sing praises to our mighty God,
Praise our deliuerers name,
Our loving Lord, who now in need,
Has kythd to be the same.
The faythlesse snares did compass us,
Their nets were set about:
But yet our dearest Father in Heaven,
He has redeemd us out.
Not only that, but by his power,
Our enemies feet they slayd,
Whom he has trapt, and made to fall
Into the pit they made.
Sing praises then both young and old,
That in this town remain,
To him that has releeu'd our necks,
From Turkish yoke profane.
Let us wash off onr sins impure,
Cast off our garments vile,
And haunt his Temple every day,
To pray his name a while.
O praise him for the victory,
That he has made us have:
For he it was revenged our cause,
And not our army brave:
Praise him with Trumpet, Piphre, and drum,
With Lutes and Organes fine,
With Viols, Gitterns, Cistiers als,
And sweetest voices syne:
Sing praise, sing praise both young and old,
Sing praises one and all,
To him that has redeemd us now,
From cruel Pagans thrall.
IN hearing of this Song, me thinks,
My members waxes faint,
Nor yet from dullness can I keep
My mind by no restraint.
But lo, my Yrny head does no^
Upon my Adamant breast,
My eyelids will stand up no more,
But fall to take them rest.
And through my weak and weary hand,
Does slide my pen of lead,
And sleep does else possess me all,
The similitude of dead.
The God with golden wings through ports
Of horn does to me creep,
Who changes ofter shapes transformd,
Then Proteus in the deep.
How soon he came, quite from my mind,
He worldly cares remoou'd,
And all my members in my bed,
Lay still in rest beloved.
And syne I heard a joyful song,
Of all the feathered bands
Of holy Angels in the heaven,
Thus singing on all hands.
Chorus Angelorum.
SIng, let us sing with one accord
Hallelu-iah on hye,
With every elder that does bow
Before the Lamb his knee:
Sing four and twenty all with us,
Whill Heaven and earth resound,
Replenisht with Iehouas praise,
Whose like cannot be found:
For he it is, that is, and was,
And evermore shall be,
One only one vnseparate,
And yet in persons three.
Praise him, for that he create has
The Heaven, the earth, and all,
And ever has preserved them since
From their ruin and fall:
But praise him more, if more can be,
That so he loves his name,
As he does mercy show to all
That do profess the same:
And not alanerly to them
Professing it aright:
But even to them that mix therewith
Their own inventions slight:
As specially this samin time
Most plainly may appear,
In giving them such victory
That not aright him fear:
For since he shows such grace to them
That think themselves are just,
What will he more to them that in
His mercies only trust?
And since that so he uses them
That doubt for to be saved,
How much more them that in their hearts
His promise have engrau'd?
And since he does such favor show
To them that fondly pray
To other Mediators, then
Can help them any way:
O how then will he favor them,
Who prayers do direct
Unto the Lamb, whom only he
Ordaynd for that effect?
And since he does revenge their cause,
That worship God of bread,
(An error vain the which is bred
But in a mortal head)
Then how will he revenge their cause
That only fear and serve
His dearest Son, and for his sake
Will for no perils swerue?
And since that so he pities them
That bear upon their brow
The mark of Antichrist the Whore,
That great abuser now,
Who does the truest Christians
With fire and sword invade,
And make them holy Martyrs, that
Their trust in God have laid,
How will he them that thus are used,
And bear upon their face
His special mark, a certain sign
Of everlasting grace?
Put end unto the travels (Lord)
And miseries of thy Saints,
Removing quite this blindness gross,
That now the world so dants*
Sing praises of his mercy then
His superexcellence great,
Which does exceed even all his works
That lie before his seat:
And let us sing both now and ay
To him with one accord,
O holy, holy, God of Hosts,
Thou everliving Lord.
THus ended was the Angels song:
And also here I end,
Exhorting all you Christians true
Your courage up to bend.
And since by this defeat ye see,
That God does love his name
So well, that so he did them aid
That served not right the same:
Then though the Antichristian fect
Against you do conjure,
He does the body better love
Then shadow, be ye sure:
Do ye resist with confidence,
That God shall be your stay,
And turn it to your comfort, and
His glory now and ay.
FINIS.
