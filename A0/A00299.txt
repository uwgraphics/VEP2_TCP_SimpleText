Enormities vsyd by the Clergy.
Here flows diverse enormities vsyd by the Clergy / and by some writers their
adherentis / and specially against the heresy of symony vsyd by the Clergy.
How some of the Clergy and their adherentis causeles have skla^derously spoken
agayns this noble realm of England and agayns diverse of the Kings lay
subjects / and have preached and wrytyn against small offe^sys / leuyng ye
greter offensys in the law of god vntouheyd. Ca. i.
THe grace of our lord Ihu Christ / the charity of god / and the comunycacyon
of ye holy ghost / be ever with our noble King with his nobles and counselors
and with us all Amen.

OF late time about the begynny^g of this present parlyament / that was
begone the thryd day of November in the.xxj. year of the Reygne of our most
drad soueraygne lord yt now is / King henry the yght, defensor of our feyth /
when the clergy hard tell that the great extorcyon that they had long time
used / in the wrongful taking of mortuaryes / and by probate of testamentys /
should be reformed / and more meanly qualyfyed to the great relyfe and
comfort of all the kings lay subyectes / Then one of them stood up / and
said opynly / that it was to be feared that the commons of this realm of
England / be much infected with heresye because they intendyd to minyshe and
to pluck from the church ye lybertyes of Christ's church / dredyng that
thereby it might fortune to this realm / as lately be fell to the realm of
Boeme / that was the subuercion of that same realm / But it semyth that therein
ye clarke there opyned his covetous stomach / then calling their wrongful
exaccyo^s to be the lybertyes of Christ's church / not considering that there
be.ii. lybertyes in the church / one that is temporal that has be geuyn by
the king and by his noble progenytours which may be resumed by like auctoryte
And there is an other spirytuall lyberty that comyth only from god / that is
spoken of.i. Coryn.iij. saying Our lord is the spyryte / and where the spyryte
of god is / there is lybertye / and that lybertye none Emperor ne King can ne
may take from the church.

Now although percase the said clerk be a famous doctor / and precher of ye
word of god / and be also a chaste man of his body / yet it aperyth euyde^tly
by yt seyeng that he is sore infected with Aueryce / which is the seruytude and
bondage of Idols and is also root of all euylls / god of his grace amend it
in him and all other / but he would not there speak of ye volupteous
conversation / and extorcion / and other abhomynacyo^s of the clergy / that
ryseth of the superfluite of their temporal possessions / and of the mysusyng
thereof / neither of the usurpation of their temporal dyngnytes and auctorytes
/ neither yet of the great and most detestable heresye of symonye used and
long time accustomed among them selfys / as shall be said here after.

And also sythyn that time of ye beginning of this same foresaid present
parlyamente it has been a common saying of diverse of the clergy / that there
were never so many herytykes in England / as be now at this present day / yea
and also diverse of the lay gentlemen learned in the common law of this realm /
and other folks being of kynred or having offices / fees or rewards or
belyechere of the clergy / with a counterfett petye / monefully affirm / and
openly speak the same / wherein it semyth that they be not well circumspect in
their sayenges / for onlese that they be able to name / and to bring forth
those persons that they speak of / and mean it by / and also that they can
show their opynyons / and can prove them to be heretycall / It should else seem
to be a great blasphemy to the Kings hyghnes / being most catholyke and
chrystyane defensor of the feyth And also to be an unnatural and execrable
sclander to his most honorable counsel / to this his high court of parlyament
/ and to all this noble and good catholyke realm / wherein is no little
offense if it be well considered. And yet percase in their so sayng all though
they mystake the lay fee therein yet regardyng the clergy in their said
sayenges / they may fortune to say more trewly therein than they be ware of / as
shall be said hereafter / And although the heresye of diverse of the clergy
shall be here sum what spoken of / yet the good sort of good catholyke and
vertous clerks be not offended thereby / for this writer and compyler / ever
has said / and contynually will say with saint Austen / O veneranda sacerdotum
dignitas / in quorum manibus dei filius velud in vtero virginis incarnatur / O
felices sacerdotes / si sacerdotaliter vixeritis. and.c. yet of the voluptuous
and heretycall sort of the clergy it may be said in contrary wise as thus /
O misera et detestanda superborum / cupidorum / Iracu^dorum / luxuriancium /
gulosorum / Inuidorum / accidiosorum / voluptuosorum and hereticancium
sacerdotum / animalis and diabolica condicio / in quorum manibus dei filius
iterum quantum in vobis est) crucifigitur and morti traditur / et non defensi
sepulcro / sed fetido sterquilinio mittitur / videlicz in ora et corpora
sacerdotu^ multiphariis viciis and heresi plenorum / O infelices sacerdotes /
si non sacerdotaliter vixeritis / And it is said Did. xl. Ca. multi sunt.
and.c. that there be many prestes / and that there be but few prestes / many in
name and but few indede / and thereof read in aboke called Dextra pars oculi
sacerdotis.

And also where some men have lately taken great study and pleasure / to
ympung a virtuous Clerk and a good holsom precher of ye word of god / so
esteemed to be in the opynio^ of many good me^ / and also diverse me^ has been
set with their talles in their hands to write and to mark many of his sayenges
in ye pulpit thynkyng thereby to confound / to abjure or to brenne him /
wherein appeared great lack of good benygnyte / and of charity / and thereby
semith to appear great plentye of craftye and e^uyous cruelnes / and also some
me^ write against diverse good catholyke and crystyn layme^ / calling some of
them i^ mockage / ye pacyfyer and some other of them Eua^gelyke broders / and
other diverse names at their pleasure / without any louy^g and frainall spryte of
good council / or of charytable or secret reformacyon.

And also they have taken great study in confutyng of some other men's
wrytynges / which they thought to be erroneous / and it semyth to them to be
welldon But yet percase it may be said to such writers of those things which
be but tryfles in comparyson of other great matters that they never lust to
speak ne to write of / and yet they be great errors and como^ly used / as
Christ said to ye pharyseys Ipocrytys / Math. xxiij. and Luc. xi. Woo be to you
scrybys and pharyseys Ipocrytys / that teache to pay tythy^ges of Myntys / Rwe /
Annes / Cu^myn / and such other potteherbys / and ye leave untaught gretter
things of more grauyte in ye law Iugment / mercy / charity / and feyth /
These things (says Christ) must be done / and the other not left undone /
such blind guydes spytt out a flee or gnatt / and swalow the great Camel /
and outwardely show them selfys like to be Just men / but inwardly they be full
of Ipocryse and of inyquyte / Trewly ye be witnessys to your selfys (seyth
Christ) for ye be the sonnys of them that have killed the prophettys / and ye
be (says Christ) serpents and ye brood or spawne of venomous adders / And
These words be now here spoken and also rehearsed for causes following / for
there be far greater vycys and more detestable synnys / customably used /
contrary to the law of god / than these things before rehersyd / which of
necessite ought to be written and preached of / And as yet belefte unspoken /
vnprechyd / and unwritten of / as of late season / As of Irregularyte of diverse
of the clergy / sacrylege by them usually comytted in mysependynge the
tythynges and oblacions of Christ's church / on fresshe apparel on them
selfs / their servants / their horsys / mulys / and wenches / And in their
costely byldynges and repayryng of their housys and the superfluous apparel of
the same / with Arras and other things their wine and pompous plate / The
great expencys and cost in dayntye vytells / The unlawful coniuracyons used
by frerys and other clerks / The usual bre-Kyng of the.iij. essencyall vows
of relygyon The dylygent study of diverse of the clergy in ye sleyght of
craftye handlyng and setting of dyse and cards to theintent to begyle all men
that plays with them as doctor dewys ase / byshope prymero / and such other
The felonyes and murders oftyntymes conmytted by clerkys Their conuiccio^
thereof / and their acquitall from ye conuycte prysone by wylfull perjury
of.xii. forsworn clerkys / The having and mysusyng of te^porall possessions of
the clergy / contrary to the commandment of god in ye old law / and
contrary to the example and techyng of Christ in the new law of his gospel
/ and contrary to ye ordinance of many holy canons i^ ye decrees / and
contrary to ye wryty^ges of diverse holy doctors now say^tes i^ heaven / The
usual symonye of diverse of the clergy / which is most great and most
detestable heresy / as partly shall be said hereafter / These and such other be
the great offensys against the law of god / and yet few or none of the comoun
prechers / do speak against any of them / nether yet he nor any of them which
has taken upon the^ to write against ye said tryfels being worthy to be
called but trysyls in comparyson of the said more greuos offenses write no
thing of the foresaid great and grievous offenses in the law / nether ons
sterr their pens thereto.

Wherefore it semyth that it maybe said to diverse of the prechers and to other
of the clergy and to such writers of such less offenses / as Christ said to
the pharyseys Ipocrytys Mat. xxiii. woo be to you scrybys and pharyseys
Ipocrytys which theche / preche or write / of / or against ye smaller offe^cys
in gods law / and use your selfs to co^mytt ye greater offe^cys / and ye
neither use to teache / to preche neither to write against them / which if the
great mercy of god / were not over us / were myche like to be the cause of
subversion of this noble Realm / and of all other Regio^s where they be used /
without correccyon God and our noble King defe^sor of ye faith a mende it amen.

Of the kings great benyngnyte and favor vsyd alwey toward ye clergy And of
their great presumpcyon and cruelte showed against his grace and his lay
subiectys. Ca. ij.
It is written in the holy decrees that if any man at any time after his
baptysme / happen to slay a pagaue / although it were in his defense / he shall
never be Received into holy orders / if he happen to take any holy orders / he
shall be put from them as it aperyth Distinci..l. de hiis clericis / yet that
natwithsta^dyng / it has oftyntymes beseen that one pressed has Robbed / and
wylfully murdered a good christian man / yea and sometime one priest has wylfully
Robbed and murdered an other priest / and theruppon he has been attached /
indyted / arayned / and convicted / wheruppo^ / his ordynary has been redye at
ye bar and there has allowed and Receyuyed him for his clerk / contrary to
the said canons / and thereuppon / he has been conveyed to the conuycte preson
/ and in short time thereafter / he has been acquytt by a quest of xij.
Forsworn clerks / and after that he has song and said mass at his pleasure
and has served a cure / and has song trentalles for soulis / contrary to
the ordyuauncis of the said canons / And also in the said /.l. Dystincion /
Cap. i. expremissis and secu^do / Si lapsus / and other canons there / as Qui
igitur / and Si quis Ep^us / And si post ordinacione^ / and other / It is also
there ordained that if any clerk at any time after the Receyuyng of holy
orders, happen to fall in sin of the flesh / tha^ he shall be put from all
holy orders / and from mynystryng at the Altar / and that same is affermed by
saint Gregory. xi. q^. iii. Ip^e liga^di / and there p^uilegni oino / and there
by saint Austyn Rediclin est / And such a clerk ons deposed or disgradyd
shall never be admytted again to any holy orders / as it aperith Did. l. Si
/ quis / and / qui semell / and presbiteru^ de quo / Such prestis have had
to myche favor here / in this land / of ye King / of his lordys te^porall /
and of all his lay subiectis / for godis sake / and yet they be none of goddis
servants / as it aperyth in diverse holy canons Did. l. As is beforesaid /
And also it aperyth by / christ's gospel Math. vij. that god utterly Refusyth
all such clerkys / To be any of his. seruauntis / where it aperyth that such
clerkys presomtuously shall say to god / Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied
and preched in thy name / and in thy name / we have cast out deuyles / and in
thy name we have done or made many virtues / And the^ Christ shall knowledge to
them / that he never knew them (as to their salvation) and will bid them /
go ye from me all ye sinners / and workers of i^yquite. And here ye shall
perceive on ye one side ye great superfluous favor heretofore showed to ye
clergy, by ye King / and by his noble progenytours / and by ye lords and by
other their lay subjects / and on ye other side ye shall perceive the great
crueltye / and percyalyte of ye ordynaries and of other Clerkys of auctoryte /
custumably showed to the King and to his noble progenytouris / to his lordis
and to other his lay subiectis / For where Clerkis many times by their evil
governance / as by their theft / murder / sacrilege and other their grievous
offe^cys have lost the pryuylege of their Clergy / as has been said before /
by their own law / yt is by many holy canons in ye holy decrees / and by
Christis gospel / yet ye Kings hyghtnes / and his noble progenytoures ye
lordys / and other their lay subiectis have alweys ben contented at their
desyrys and requestys / to make statutys / in favor of such clerkys murderers
and other / thynkyng thereby / to have deserved thank of god / and of the
other good sort of ye clergy / where they in recompense of such reverence and
great curtesy / and good favorable humanyte showed to them / have alweys i^
contrary wise showed to ye noble progenytourys of ye king / and to his grace /
to his lordys temporal / and to all other ye kings lay subiectys / all
cruelty / and customable percyalyte in such their auctorytes as they have vsyd
/ sumetyme presomtuously and cruelly / and few times or never louyngly / nether
favorably nether yet indyfferently / as now shall be said And first of their
presumpcyon.

Where god by ye mouth of the prophet Esaye.x. cursyth all them that makes any
wyked laws / yet the prelatys and other the clergy not dredyng that curse have
made secretly in their conuocacio^ house / here within the Kings realm
presumtuously certain constituicions that they call prouyncyall / wherein i^
sum case they spare not to curse and to e^terdyte ye Kings castles royal /
and other honorable his dominyons and all the inhabytau^ce thereof / how noble /
how good / how virtuous / howsyke / and how nygh the artetycle of death so ever
they be / as it appreth in the constitucions prouynciall in ye chapter /
Contingit aliquando / and all that is done for mayntenaunce of their temporal
possessions and of their temporal honourys / where it semyth yt none such
should be longyng to them.

And here now folowith so^what more of the cruelte and percyalyte long time
showed and continued by the prelates and other yt Clergy to all ye Kings lay
subjects and of the unlawful and parcyall favor borne by the said prelatys
to the unthrifty and cursyd sort of the clergy In the holy decrees Did.l.
There is a little chapter yt begynyth thus / Si quis viduam / wherein it is
ordained that if any man marye a wedow or woman left of an other man he shall
never there after take any holy orders / and if he hapen to take any such holy
orders he shall be put from them / And in the same chapter it is ordained yt who
so ever at any time after his baptysme be in deed / or by counsel / or in his
defense / gyltye or agreeable to any murder / or manslaughter / he shall never
take holy orders / And if he happen to take any then he shallbe put from them /
and he shall never take communyo^ or howsyll but like a lay man / And also in
the next chapter following Peruenit ad nos There it is ordained that if any
clerk at any time after holy orders by him taken / fall in lapse of ye flesh
he shall be put from all holy orders and he shall never serve at the altar as
before is said.

Now / no man can read that ever any lay man has been fauoryd or dyspensed
withal by his ordynary in this case / how honest / how good / and how virtuous
so ever he and his wife or wyffys were / and yet all his doing in that case /
has be done by ye law of god and of the holy church / wherein the said
ordynaryes have vsyd either to high Justice or to great cruelte without
dyscrecyon or mercy.

And on ye other side few men or none can tell or has redd that ever any of
the clergy comytty^g felony wylfull murder fornycacyo^ adultery inceste
sacrelege / or tape before taking of holy orders / or aft taking of them / has
at any time lost any orders / or yt he has been forbodyn or denayed
minystracio^ at the altar at any time / wherein the prelates has showed their
indiscreet favor and great percialyte / Therefore it were a charytable deed to
make an act of parlyament that all such unhappy prestes whom the holy canons
puttyth from mynystracyon at ye altar / should at ye temporal law lose all
manner of benefytes of their clergy / and should dye for felony or morder done
by them for they be no clerkys ne shall never be admyttyd to their clergy as
before is said. Did..l.

And although diverse prelates may percase trewly say yt they never comytted
nether such presumptuous rygoure nether such indiscreet and pereyall favor as
now has been spoky^ of / yet they can not excuse them selfys / but that they
know that hit has been so this long time vsyd / and yet every one of them
sufferyth it / and neither speak / neither preche / neither yet write against
it / wherefor it may be said to them as christ said to ye phareseys Ipocrytys
Math. xxiij. woe be to you. and.c.

And yet over this the said clergy has made an ordinance and decre that who
so ever teache preche or frowardly menyth contrary to any of the fore said
decrees decretallys or ordynaunces in their constitucyons prouyncyall shallbe
Iugyd an heretyke / as it aperyth in the said constytucions prouyncyall titulo
/ de hereticis Cap. nullus quoque / And where the king of his Justice and
gracyous favor proclaymyth all his Actys made in his high court of
parlyamente / in every shere within this his realm / and causyth them to be in
prynte because no man should be excusyd by ygnoraunte / The clergy does in a
contrary wise / make their constycyons to be secret from / the temporal and
lay subjects of ye King / whereby they may daily fall in danger of heresye /
and that Ignorantly / wherein semyth to be myche craftye cruelte

Of the most detestable heresye of symonye vsyd customably by them of the
clergy and the most co^uenye^t order for the punishment of the same. Cap. iij.
Also he that lusts to read in the holy decrees. i..q^. i. he shall there
find a greater danger among the clergy tha^ is yet spoken of / or much
preched / or written of / that is yt every Symonyte is an infydele and an
heretyke / and that he is no member of Chrystys church / and that he is so
cursed that nothing ca^ be blessed by him / And yet most commonly they be the
gouerners and rulers of the church here in this world / yea and among many
sundry kyndys of heresies rehersyd xxiiij. q^. iij. Quidam aute^ heretici /
That heresy of symony is furst named as most detestable before god / yea and it
is so detestable and abhomynable yt it can not welbe otherwise lykoned but to
ye treason of Judas yt sold and betrayed god / yea and yet morouer it is so
detestable before god / that every man being of auctoryte that knowyth it / and
is not vehemently chaufed therewith / and against ye offe^ders therein is cursed
with Simon Magus / which as clerkys say is dampened in hell.

What prelate or other clerk of Auctoryte / can a void now that curse / that
fell on Simon Magus / And also ye Clergy tell the lay men / that who so ever
know any manner of person / to be an heretyk and does not dysclose that person /
and also his heresy / he is afauorer of ye heresy / and he may be thought as
gyltye therein as the pryncypall heretyke / as it apperyth.xxiij. q^. iij. Qui
potest obuiare / and Also it is written Consencie^tes and agentes pari pena
punientur / And also Ioh.ij. Qui dixerit ei aue co^icat operibus eius malignis
Ecce predixi vobis vt in die dn^i no^ co^fundamini / Now than by the Kings
commandment or assente It may be asked of ye Clergy / in their house of
conuocacyon which and how many of them can trewly say / that he never comytted
that heresy of symony / nether has consentyd thereto / nether has at any time
knowyn one or mo clerks to have offendyd therein / and yet he has not
dysclosed it / It is to be thought by vehement suspicio^ / yt few of the^ can
Justly excuse the^ selfys thereof / And yet they be nether attached /
imprisoned / examyned / abiured / neither burned therefore But they be always
cruel on the Kings lay subiectys / in arestyng the^ / by force / by cruel
imprysonyng of them in their Dark and close prysons / where none of their
friends or other good charytable / and catholyke men / can be suffered to cum to
them / to see them and to Relyefe the unwholesome diete of them / with their
refuse of a little cold meat / small and palled drink / with honger thurst /
and could / with hard lodgyng among vermyn / with many subtle and crafty
opposyngys / and thretinynges for their lucure / yea and in abiuryng or burning
of them / which su^tyme skantely know what good faith / and heresye means /
The grace of god / and of good King harry amend it / and grant that the byll
of the lay commons called the byll / ex officio may have good furtheraunce and
speed / or else the crueltye of the clergy is like to increase / and not to be
pacyfyed / for it semyth that they had as leave dye / as to forgoo any part of
their temporal power in such cruel ha^delynge the Kings lay subiectys with
the sword of vengeance and of cruel blodeshedyng / as it apperyth in their
answer to the said byll exofficio / alleggyng for them this text / Non veni
mittere pacem / sed gladiu^ / wherein they show their foul Ipocrysye covered
with sa^ctite / And under that name and color of charity / they be cruel
murderers and blood sheders / as before is said / It is also said that every
good Chyristyn man should rather sufferdeth than to receive the holy sacrament
of the handys of any heretycall priest knowyngly / as it apereth / xxiiij. q^.
i. Si quis dederit.

Symony is comyttyd three diverse ways / furst by reward of the tongue / as by
flateryng or fair words of request / or crauynge / geuyn by your self or by
any other person for you to ye entente to have thereby spu^all promocyon / ye
knowing it furst or last / are bound in medyately to resygnacyon and to
restytucyon / Secondly by reward of vndewe service as when ye or any other
person for you do seruyes / or promise service to any man to thentente to have
spyrytuall promocyon / ye that knowing are bound to restytucyon / Thrydly by
reward of money or of any thing that is money worth as if ye or any person for
you give or promise any sum of money any catell or ferme any stuff of
household or any other thing that is money worth / as soon as ye may have
knowledge thereof / ye are bound to resygnacyon and to restytucyon of all your
profytes before reseyuyd thereof / as it appreth.i. q^. iii. Saluator predicit /
and also i^ destructorio vico^rum in the title and chapyter of Symony.

It has been oftentimes known to many men that diverse Clerks have comytted
and vsyd this heresye of symonye / But it has not been myche knowyn that any of
them has truly repentyd the^ thereof / nether by fre resygnacyon / of their
benefyces so symonytely gotyn / nether yet by restytucyon of their temporal
goods simonytely and heretically gote^ / nether in their testame^tes at the
point of death / wherefore it is to be supposed and is myche to be fered / that
all such heretycall clerkys have lacked / and shall lack grace of true
repentance / and of satysfaccion / In confyrmacyon whereof / it is not redd /
yt balam / of whom it is written Nu^. xxii. and deuteronomy.xxiiij. nether of Geysye of
whom.iiij. regum. v. nether of Judas ye traitor of who^ Mat. xxvi. neither of
the false Byshoppys scrybes and phareseys Ipocrites / which bought Christ of
Judas / of whom in many placys of holy scripture nether of Simon Magus of who^
Actu^. viij. All which were symonytys / byyng or sellyng spu^all things for
te^porall reward / of who^ it is not fownd that ever any of the^ did fruitful
penance but by all lykelyhod / they dyed Impenytente / and out of the state of
grace / And here ye may mark a marvelous usurpation in the pope / for where
saint Peter never did / ne would assoyle Simon Magus of that detestable crime
and heresye of Symony / but suffered him to perysh both in body and in soul /
yet the pope has vsyd to assoyle all symonyte clerks for money / yea and also
to dyspence with them / and to license them contynually for term of their
lives / to retain and enjoy the benefycys and all the frutys and profytes of
the same symonytly and heretycally gotten / without scrupulosyte of conscience.

And yet the pope and the clergy will not be contented / that the Kyngys
hyghnes shall at any time perdone the life of any lay heretycall person / that
they have onys Iuged to the fire or have put from them to the lay hands /
although it be euydently known / that the king has more power over the bodies
of his subjects / than the pope and all his clergy has / where by it should
seem that the pope is not only an heretyke him self / but also a customable
maynteyner and vpholder of heretykes and heresies And yet hereof we can here no
prechyng nether see no writing of late seson / but some one has scornefully
said / I pray you be good to the clergy / wherefore it may be said to many of
the prechers / and to such writers and confuters of ye smaller heresies / that
leuyth the greter offenses in goddys law as the said symonycall heresies and
other be / to be vnprechyd / vnwrytyn and not confuted / as Christ said to the
phareseys Ipocrytes Math. xxiii. as before is written / woe be to you. and.c.

The correccion of all such enormytes in the clergy of this realm be longyth
to the kings hyghnes as to his seculer-power / as it aperyth by diverse holy
canons yt is.xxiii. q^. i. Si apud carnales. xxiii. q^. iii. Qui po^t. xxiii.
q^. v. Sunt que da^ enormia / and there de lyguribus and vene ticis / and there
Regum officium est and there / Qui malos percutit / and there Si propterea / and
in many other diverse placis of the holy decrees.

And every man both temporal and spu^all is bownde to be obedyent and to
believe in all the holy canons / and to maynteyn / nothing contrary to any of
them upon pain of heresye as it is said and commanded in the said
co^stitucions prouyncyall / Titulo de heretices Ca. Nullus quoque and also.xxv.
q^. i. violatores canonum / And in co^fyrmacio^ of the Kings Auctoryte for
correccion of all enormities in the Clergy / ye may harkyn what is said thereof
Ioh. xix. When Christ stood before Pylate and was there untruely accused of
treson against Caesar / there Pylate said to Christ / know not thou that I
have power to crucyfye ye / and also to dyscharge and to forgive the / Christ
denayed it not / but affermed it / saying / Thou should have no power upon
me, but if it had be geuyn the from above / as from god / Harkyn also saint
Paul To. xiii. Where he wylleth every man to be obedient to the high power of
ye King seying let every man be subject to the powers / There is no power but
of god / he that resysteth power / does resyst ye ordinance of god / And they
that so resyste gere dampnacion to them selfys / for pryncis be not set here
in dread of any good warke / but of evil and.c. He berith the sword not
without cause / he is goddys mynystre and auenger wrathfullye to him that evil
does. etc.

And saint Peter. i. Petri. ii. says Be ye subject to every humayne creature
for god and.c. to the vengeance of evil doers and to ye laud and praise of
good men. and.c.

The prechyng / writing / and showing of theyse foresaid and other great and
grievous offe^sys against ye law of god / And the declaracio^ of ye Kings
power in punysshyng thereof / had been and yet wylbe much pleasant to god / And
also it should have been good acceptable service to the Kings hyghnes / for it
should have put / and yet may put his grace in good perfyte knowledge / what
belo^gyth for a King or prince to do herafter in all such outrageous offe^sis
/ if ye Clergy / do not cease there of / And so the correcion thereof had been /
and yet may be a help and furtheraunce to the mayneteynau^ce of the Kings
honor / and of his prerogatyfe reyall / For by estymacio^ the knowledge thereof
has been long time kept from his grace / and from his noble progenytours /
and from ye temperall lords peeris of this Realm / wherefore in the honor of
god and for the duty that ye owe to the King / ye prechers and writers that
have herto fore preached / and written / of such tryfyls and smaller of fensys
in godys law as is before rehearsed / Now preche ye and write ye furste in
reprouyng and oppressyng of these for said great and detestable vycys / and
that done than may ye preche and write of other smaller offenses at your
pleasure (quia ipsa oportet facere and illa non omittere) And so ye may also a
void from your selfys ye great and perelous curse that is fallen on Simon
Magus / or else the foresaid holy canon. i. q^. i. quisquis per pecuniam /
reports that ye be in great danger thereof / And in so doing / the time
shall be well spente / and god and the King shall be well served / and the
comynaltye of this realm may be thereby set at much rest and peace / For the
clergy in their cruel persecucyon of the kings lay subjects do all
contrary to Christ's doings and to his comaundementes and also contrary to ye
holy canon. xxiiij. q^. iii. Cap. vltimo in which holy cano^ is rehearsed
Christ's act and commandment Math. xiij. Seyeng / suffyr ye as well the
cokell as the good corn to grow both to gether till haruyst time / for dread
that when ye would wede and pluck up the cokell ye shall also therewith pluck
up the good corn by the rote / And there the said holy canon seyth It is
necessary that some heresies and heretykes be / And also Math. xv. where
Chrystis appostolys said to him / Thou knowyst that in this thy word the
pharyseys be sklanderyd / And there Christ bade and commanded those pharyseys
to be suffered / seyyng they were blind and leders of blind men or of blind
things / And no clerk dowtyth but knowyth those pharysees to be heretykes /
and yet Christ bade suffer them / But ye said cruel sort of the Clergy has
not of late season done so / But some time it has been thought that they would
abjure a good crystyan man causeles / as yt semyth by some persons lately being
in their danger and prison / wherefore these premyssys well considered it
should seem to be very necessary counsel to the ordynaryes spu^all and to
other the Clergy / to advise the^ / to leave their cruel handelyng of the
kings lay subjects for such heresies as be but small heresies in comparyso^
of greter / till they may clear and cleanse them selfys from symonye that is the
gretest and most abhomynable heresye or else till they can prove by good
auctoryte that symony is none heresye / for it semyth to be agreat abuse that
where a prelates duty is to feed Christ's flock that is put to his keeping
with holsom doctrine / yea and to anoynte and to hele them that be infected or
scabbed / louyngly with soft salnys / and not to beat them / nether to shere
or poll them / nether to slay them in there good name / ne other wise / but
louyngly and secretly to reform them that be in errors / like a good
shepherd and not to be among them like awolfe or like a bear / that all weyes
fedyth himself on ye flock / and never cheressheth them / for to such one it
may well be said ye Ipocryte and archeherytyke / if ye lust to pyke a straw or
mote out of mine eye / furste it wylbe myche necessary / that ye draw out the
great post or beam from your own eye / and so shall ye the better see to
pyke the straw or more out of mine eye.

And if ye Clergy will not be therewt contented / then it is to be thought
that the kings hyghnes has good cause to say to them / as Christ said to the
scrybys and pharyseys Ipocrytes as is before said Math..xxiii. ye be
wyttenessys to your own selfys for ye have written in your byll of answer / to
the byll of complaynte that my lay subjects has put to me in their
supplycacyon against you ye spu^all ordynaryes of this my realm / called the
byll ex officio / that ye were never grievous to your brethren / and gostly
chylderne but only to such as were infected with the pestelent poison of
heresye / with whom (ye say) that ye are commanded by Christ's gospel to
have no peace saying. Math. x. Non veni mittere pacem sed gladiu^ / And
although yet as it semyth by the prosese of that chapyter / it is not in tended
nether mente as ye have applied yt / for in four or five hundred placys of
scripture / god has commanded love and peace / and not strife war / nether
blod shedy^g / And therefore it aperyth that it may be Justly said to you as
Christ said to ye pharyseis Ipocrytes in the foresaid gospel Math. xxiii. ye
be the sons of them that slew the prophetys / ye will say seyth Christ that
if ye hadd been officers in that time when your fathers slew the prohetes that
ye would not have been their fellows in blood shedyng / but it is not so / for
at this day ye say ye love your brothers / and yet ye will kill them / but ye
ca^ not do both / and therefore Christ calls you in that said gospel / the
spawne or seed of venomous Adders and ye would blind the people and say that
therein ye esteem that ye do acceptable service to god in all such your craftye
cruelte / but ye know the contrary / though ye lust to apply and to expound
holy scripture at your pleasure and to your wretched and sinful appetytis /
to color and to hyde your cruelty and your Ipocrysye / And if any of my lay
subietes show to you holy scripture suffycyent to confou^de your wrong applynge
of scripture / and your Iwysh fables / Anon ye say that no lay man should
medell with holy scripture / but therein Christ co^foundeth you / Luc..xi.
saying to you of ye clergy woe be to you yt be learned in ye law / yt have taken
or borne away ye kaye of cu^nynge / and your self have not e^tred or gone i^ /
and ye have forboden those yt e^tred / and hereby ye think to color and to
hyde your great cruel Ipocrysy / but it is wryte^ by a famous doctor in a
book called Destructoriu^ victoru^ / That by diverse ways a man may know an
Ipocrite / whereof one now folowyth / Ccognoseuntur ipocrite ex opp^ssione
bonorum / Opprimunt enim bonos perseque^ do factis / and detrahe^do verbis /
cuiusmodi uide^tur esse hoe^s multi superiores eccle ta^seclares quam regulares
/ qui fideles and humiles seruos xp^i persequ^tur / id est eos incarcera^do and
aliqua^do combure^do occidu^t / sed, quare hoc faciunt / Certe experientia do
cente / pro eo quod eorum vitam reprobant voluptuosam / and negligenciam
reprehendunt / Sz o miser qui taliter agis / quare respiciendo scripturas
sacras / and specialiter euangelia / non consideras / quod i^ aug mentacionem
sue proprie dampnacionis ita fecerunt predecessores tui pontifices falsi /
scribe and pharesei / qui de bonis ecclesie voluptuose vixeru^t / sicut tu nunc
Nonne ep^i occiderunt rp^m / aplos and sco^s martires / reputando eos hereticos
proeo quod eorum pecca^ reprobauerunt / sic tu reputas eos hereticos qui tuam
vitam reprobant voluptuosam. and.c.

Now sythens it is suffycyently laid and prouyd to you by diverse great
auctorytees of ye holy law canon / that clerks symonytes be grettest
heretykes / yea and archeheretykes in co^paryson of a lay man that is an
heretyke / and sythens also that the same holy law canon affermyth and
declares every man of auctoryte that is not vehemently chafyd and dysplesed
with you for yt same your symony / and heresye / to be cursed with Simon Magus
which all ye will gra^te and afferme to be dampened in to hell perpetually / And
also sythens it is sufficiently prouyd by holy scripture and also it is decreed
by diverse of the said holy canons before alleged / that the punysshme^t thereof
belongyth to me that am your king and governor / as to our seculer power /
what ca^ ye now say but yt of very Justice in goddys cause and in eschewyng /
and avoydyng of that terryble curse yt fell on Simon magus / from which
almyghtye god of his great mercy save and defend us / we must be vehementley
sterede and chaufed against you / and according to your demeritis / and to
your for said answer to the said byll ex officio / to have no peace with you
/ and to say to you with criste / Math. x. Non venimittere pacem sed Gladium /
for heryn ye be wyttenessis to your own selfis / And so of necessite we must
se you punysshed with the sword of sharp execucio^ / as ye have caused other
small heretykys being but small in co^paryson of them yt be gretter heretykes
of late time to be punysshed / as with cruel arestyng you / hard impresonyng
opynlye abiuryng you / and grievously amersyng you with great fynys / and with
taking from you / all that ye have here / before symonytely and heretycally
gotten / and long received / or else with fire consume you / if ye lust not
to abjure / for in this case ye be wyttnessys to your selfys as before is said
And it is congruent / and well consonant and agreeable to good reason / and to
all laws of god and of man / furst to punysshe / and to confownde the greatter
offenders / and archeretykys / and afterward the less / for every bishop and
priest heretyk may trewly be called an Archeherytyke in comparyson of a lay
heretyke / as well for the qualytees and dyfference of their spu^all dygnyte /
as of their offensys / and therefore it ought as well to be furst punysshed / as
also most grievously / and most openly punysshed / wytnes of saint Bar. sayyng /
Non enim par debet esse pena / vbi disparest causa.

Now if any clerk lust to make answer here to / then for the love of god let
their answer be put in writing charitably / that it may be Replied to / if
need be / Or else let them yield them selfys gyltye therein / and put them
selfys holy to ye mercy and grace of the Kings hyghnes / which is / and
has alweys ben / merciful and gracyous /
