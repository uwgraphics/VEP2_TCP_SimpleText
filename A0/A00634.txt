A brief Treatise upon the first Table of the Law, orderly disposing the
principles of Religion, whereby we may examine our selves.

Written by Master DVDLEY FENNER, Minister of the Gospel.

ROMANS 7. 7. I knew not sin, but by the Law. To the Reader.
GEntle Reader, thou have hear a brief and plain exposition of the first
Table of the Law of God. Made by Master Dudley Fenner, for the profit of his
own particular charge and some other his friends. The which coming to my
hands, I thought good to make the profit thereof more general. And the
rather, in that it was the first fruits of his labors, being made by him
before the twentieth year of his age: Whereby thou may see with what an
excellent spirit he was endued, even in his tender years. Accept it therefore
as it is men^ thee: and if thou reap thereby any profit, give God the glory.

A short and plain Table orderly disposing the Principles of Religion, and
first of the first Table of the Law, whereby we may examine our selves.


the Law preached, 2. Cor. 3. 5. 6. and Gospel preached, 2. Cor. 3. 5. 6.


By these two Instruments the holy Ghost works

By the first,

By the second,

The Law is a doctrine

2 Given) And therefore every thing taught out of the Law rightly interpreted,
is to be received, Romans 7. 7.

2 Commanding to do) One difference between the Law and the Gospel, which
to apprehende Christ, and so justification, etc. asks but belief, Romans 10.
15. Galat. 3. 10. 11. 12.

3 Wholeman) Therefore in the commandments, not the body only, but the
judgment, will, and affections, in the soul must be taught what to do, and
leave undone.

4 Perfect obedience.) A second difference of the Law and Gospel is gathered:
for the Gospel asks but a true faith, not perfect, Mark 9. 24. 1. These. 3.
10. Also by this, not only the thing, but the necessary means to the things
is commanded and forbidden, Proverb. 31. 5. and 8.

5 Commanded forbidden) So that every precept does not only command the
good, or forbid the evil, but both, Mat. 22.

That the first work may better be wrought, the Law has two properties,
Deuteronomy. 28. 3. 15.

Curse or punishment, which is the first, which punishes the least offense
with the wrath of God to be felt for ever sin soul and body, called death,
Gal. 3. 10. Romans 6. 23. and 5. 12. 13. Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Gene. 2. 17.

Blessing or reward, which is the second, giving to the perfect obedience of
all, the favor of God to be felt with all blessing in soul and body for ever,
called life, Deuteronomy. 6. 24. 25. Leuit. 18. 5. Deuteronomy. 30. 19. 20.

Thus much of the Law, with the properties and use of it. Now follows the
interpretation of it, where is declared what is commanded and forbidden.

In the interpretation of the Law, must be seen what is commanded and
forbidden, Prou. 2. 9.

Generally Jointly in the whole body of the law joined together, and in the
general, division of the Law of God. Specially what is in every particular
commandment.
In the whole body of the Law jointly considered, two things are commanded:
Knowledge 1. Col. 10. and Practice, 1. Col. 10.


Concerning the first, is commanded the true knowledge of good and evil, which
is for the age of every man. Col. 1. 9. 10. Phil. 1. 9. Heb. 5. 14. Luke 2. 52.
To

Practice is the following or flying of the thing known to be commanded or
forbidden*

it has Inward feeling. Phil. 1. 9. and 2. 13 Outward works. Ephe. 5. 10.


By feeling of the heart we choose, love, desire, delight, are zealous in the
good thing it self, that it may be done, to refuse, hate, abhor, and are
zealous against the known evil. Amos. 5. 14. Phil. 1. 9. 1. These. 21. Amongst
these, zeal is an earnest affection of the mind, whereby we do follow the
good, or flee the evil, so much as we are vehemently grieved with that which
hinders it, 2. Cor. 7. 11. Mat. 3. 7. 1. King. 19. 10. Act. 18. 25. Number. 25.
13. Here is forbidden the contrary, as no feeling. Ephe. 4. 17. Zeph. 1. 12.
In zeal forbidden, want of true zeal. Apoca. 3. 15. Zeal for evil. Mat.
10. 21. Zeal for good beyond knowledge. Luke 9. 53.

In feeling, the affections must be so ordered, as that they may be equally
more slack or strong, as the good or evil shall be greater or lesser. The
order of the Law confirms this, when God is provided for first, than man:
first particular bounds, the^ general. He that loves Father and Mother more
then me. Mat. 10. 37. So we must desire more the presence of God in the life to
come, than his favor in this life. 1. Corint. 17. And love and reverence more
the teaching Elders than governing only. 1. Tim. 5. 17. etc. For the better
doing of this

is required Perfection Mat. 12. 37. and 37. verse 5. and Sobriety. Mat. 12.
37. and 37. verse 5.


Perfection is, when the affections in doing are both strong enough, and also
sincere or upright. 1. Chro. 29. 9. Strength is, when according as the good or
evil is, there lacks no earnestnes of affection. Deuteronomy 6. 5. Mat. 22. 37.
Here is forbidden the least remission or weakness. Revel. 2. 4. Vprightnes is,
when the affection loves, desires, etc. In a single heart, only because GOD
commands, and for that end Which he commands generally to all things,
the settinge forth of his glory. 1. Co. 10. 32. and Chap. 6. 20.
this is called simplicity, truth, a single heart, Deuteronomy. 18. 13. John 1. 47.
Ephe. 6. 14. and 6. 6. 1. Chron. 29. 5. Forbidden hypocrisy, vain glory,
etc. Mat. 6. 5. 1. Cor. 13. 3. Phi. 1. 16. and 2. 3.

Sobriety in affection, is to hold them in, so that they pass not measure.
2. Tim. 1. 6. 1. Tit. 8. Thus much of feeling.

The second thing in practice, is the outward work, when from the inward
feeling, the members of the body execute. Romans 6. 12. 13. Romans 12. 1. The want
of this forbidden. Iam. 1. 26. 27. To all this is commanded Perseverance Ephesians.
6. 10. and Watchfulnes, Ephesians. 6. 10.


Perseverance is always to continue and go forward in doing good, and
fleeing evil. Ezech. 18. 25. 1. Colos. 10. To this is contrary a stay, or
going backwarde, Gal. 5

Watchfulness is a continual care with ourselves, that we be readily
prepared, as we ought, to practice good, and resist evil, which is set forth,
Ephe. 6. 10. 18. 1. Cor. 16. 13. 1. These. 5. 6. Mark 13. 35. In this is
forbidden no continuance, no care, too little, to slake, etc. Genesis 3. Eve.
David. 2. Sam. 11. 1. 2. 3. 1. These. 5. 3. 6.

The remedy of our sins in these, is Christ his death, with his knowledge.
Luke 2. 52. With his feeling, John 4. 34. With his zeal. John 2. 17. His
continuance in obedience throughout his life. John 17. 4. His watchfulnes. Mat.
4. 4. 10.

Thus much of that which is generally forbidden and commanded in the body of
the Law. Now follows what is generally in the division general of the law.

The whole Law is divided by the Lord him self into two tables.

The first does contain those duties which we owe to him directly in his
service Deuteronomy. 4. 13. and Exodus 34. 1. 2.

The second which we owe unto our brethren. Mat. 22. 36. Romans 13. 8. 9.

In this division we are charged two things. First, that to perfect
obedience of the Law, we should bring these two sorts of duties sound and
whole, as those which then only are pleasing unto God, when they are found
together. Mich. 6. 7. 8. 1. Ioh. 5. 2. and 4. 20. 21. Here then is forbidden,
the seuering of them, as some will so delight in exercise of religion, as they
will neglect other duties toward men, as Masters, Fathers, Magistrates,
etc. And some seek so to please these in several duties, as they neglect too
much the other, as reading of the Law of God, hearing the word preached, and
calling it to mind beeinge heard, etc. Both which are condemned as ungodly
and unjust. Romans 24. 26. Tit. 1. 4. The forgiveness of this sin is had in
Christ, who was condemned as a blasphemer, this righteousness is imputed to us
from him. John 17. 1. 34. 5. 6. etc. Heb. 5. 7. 8. And with this grace, the
other, to be godly and just, is always given. Tit. 2. 13. and 12. 13. Hence we
are taught, that feeling some readiness unto godliness, we should turn our
selves also to endeavor to work justice: and contrary, the second thing
commanded in this division, is, we should prefer love, delight, etc. The
duties we owe to God, before those we owe to men, Mat. 22. 36. 1. Sam. 13. 11.
12. The remedy in Christ accused as a blasphemer, yet sought the glory of his
Father, not his, John 2. 17. 18. This mercy makes us come to this duty,
Acts 4. 18. 19. Here we must often mark how by stealth we shall be drawn to
the over loving, fearing, etc. of men, and in time resist it. Hitherto what is
commanded and forbidden generally in the Law. Now follows the particulars
in the first table.

In the first Table are commanded duties unto the Lord, which we owe every
day, that are to his person directly. Com. 1. or to his worship. the parts. 2.
co^. the true manner of using the^. 3.

or one in seven.


In the first commandment, Exodus 20. 2. 3. verse, we must consider first the
reason, then the precept. I am the Lord thy God. I take this to be a reason of
the next verse: F^r if it were a precept, it should redounde, seeing the
contrary being forbidden in that which follows this, is commanded thereby
also. 2. It is not like the other 3. having reasons annexed, this the first and
the chiefest should want. 3. A general authorizing of the law went before.
We may note the reasons are added, to show us our sin the better, when we
shall see we have broken not a bare precept, but a precept persuaded by such
unanswerable reasons. Also that when we rise by Christ, we might not only be
taught what to do, but be allured to it. Thy Lord. This word Iehoua notes
out his being eternal, infinite, beginning and ending of all things. Exodus 3.
14. Revel. 1. 8.

By this it appears, this Law appertains to all; because he is the Lord
of all. Thy God: that is, one who does vouchsafe thee a peculiar favor, when
in thy creation he endued thee with corporal and spiritual benefits, and
does enritch thee unto eternal life, Psalm. 144. 15. Heb. 8. 10. Ezec. 36. 26.
32. Luke 37. 38. Heb. 11. 16. By this appears, that neither we nor the Jews
had promises of this life only: lastly, that the true fountain of subjection
unto God, is this assurance, He is our God, Joshua. 24. 16. Romans 12. 1. 1. Pet.
2. 1. Which brought. By this we are taught the better to nourishe the former
root of obedience, to call often to remembrance the particular benefits of
God. By this appears that the Law was given to the Jews, and us, not only
to bring us unto Christ, but also to allure and instruct us to obedience when
Christ is received. Thus much of the reason. Now follows the commandment:
Thou shall have no strange or other Gods before me. To have an other God, is
to set up an other whom we will acknowledge to be of power, of goodness,
justice, of some excellent nature, and therefore fear, love, reverence, hang
on him in all estates, Deuteronomy. 26. 17. 18. As they look for him to be their
God, as above, so that where this is wanting, either on the part of God, or the
people, they are called without God, Ephe. 2. 12. Not his people, Ose. 1. 9.
This the Lord forbids to be attributed unto any but his own Majesty,
because he only is the Lord our God, and by this forbiddinge commands the
contrary, that he only should be acknowledged God, he alone so loved, feared,
reverenced, etc. In this commandment therefore we are Psalm. 82. 6. To deny
his Justice, Mal. 3. 13. There forgiveness of this sin was bought by the
slander of ignorance and blasphemy laid on Christ, and the anguishe of his
soul, which he felt for our erroures laid on him: by which also we die unto
this sin, and raise this part of obedience, Ephesians. 4. 13. After this true
acknowledging of the Lord out of his word, must proceed: first a sure
confidence in the Lord, with the fruits of the same, Psalm. 100. 3. Then the
other affections of love, reverence, fear of the Lord: Also a sure confidence
in the Lord, is from the assurance of his favor, to be assured from him only
for continual defense, deliverance, and succor in soul and body, Psalm. 27. 1.
3. and 3. 7. 9. Prou. 14. 26. From this confidence springes trust or hope,
which is to wait and look for the help, which in confidence we assure our
selves of from the Lord, Psalm. 33. 18. 19. 20. 21. Yea although means be
wanting, we give glory unto God, Romans 4. 20. 2. Kings, 6. 16. From hence
comes it, that we fear not in greatest dangers, Kin. 6. 16. Psalm. 3. 7. and
27. 3. That in the time of affliction, we are patient, Prou. 20. 22. Hebr. 10.
33. Without all murmuring to hold our peace, Psalm. 39. 10. Receiving them as
from a father, Job. 1. verse 21. Psalm. 89. 39. 49. Rejoicing in them assuredly,
Iam. 1. 2. Hence also in every condition of life to glory and rejoice
unspeakably, Psalm. 13. 6. and 16. 7. 8. 9. Joel 2. 23. Zepha. 3. 14. Here is
forbidden first the want of these, and the contrary, as to waver or doubt,
Psalm. 13. 1. 3. and 88. 15. To leave our hope, Heb. 10. 39. To despair, Genesis
8. 13. Impatience, Ierem. 20. 14. 18. To have trust in ordinary means; and to
make flesh our arm, is forbidden, Iere. 17. 5. 6. 7 etc. To glory in these,
and be proud of them, Deuteronomy. 8. 17. 2. Chron. 16. 1. Ierem. 49. 3. 16. and 2.
13. Ezech. 28. 2. 3. Esaie 30. 12. Diffidence in binding God to means Genesis 16.
2. Number. 14. 3. 2. King. 7. 2. Luke 1. To fear for the signs of heaven, Iere.
10. 2 To cleave too much to the holiness of places and persons distinct,
Ierem. 7. 49. 1. Kin. 12. 18. To hope in Astronomers, Interpreters of Dreams,
Witches, etc. Dan. 2. 2. In Southsayers, etc. Leuit. 20, 6. 7. Planet gasers,
etc. Deu. 78. verz 11. To use evil means to do good, 1. Kings 12. 25. 26.
Romans 3. 4. Out of this confidence farther proceeds a continual carefulnes,
that in all our ways, that is, thoughts, words and deeds, etc. we see his
will, and approve it, and so for that cause look for hiis blssing and
direction, Prou. 3. 6, and 16, 3. Genesis 5. 22 and 17, 1. and 48. 15. Psalm. 146.
9. Numb, 15. 39 Here is forbidden to walk according to our own judgment and
wisdom, Number. 15. 39. Gene. 11. 4. Also a distrustful care, Math. 6. 25. Luke
12. 26. To this last of all is adjoined humility, when emptying our selves of
all, we give God the whole glory of all good things, which are in us, Gene.
18. 27. 1. Pet. 5. 5. Esai 40. 3, 4. Forbid love of our honor, Mat. 18. 3. 4.
Vain glory, Phil. 2. 3. Boasting of any thing in us, 1. Co. 4. 7.
Presumption, Zeph. 3. 11. 12. Hitherto of a sure confidence commanded in the
law, with those things which spring from the same, the affections commanded
here the use whereof is perpetual, are the true love and reverence of God. The
true love of God is when with all our soul, strength. etc. we cleave to the
Lord above all, Matt. 22. 36. Hence is commanded to desire his presence more
visible in heaven above all, and rejoice in it above all, Psalm. 16, 10. 11. 2.
Co. 5. 8. Here is forbidden, the love of men, wives, children, or any thing of
this life, to desire it more then the Lord and his presence, Phil. 4. 18. John
12. 43. Reverence of God, is when being overwhelmed with the infinitnes and
excellency of his being, wisdom, strength, goodness, mercy, justice,
purity, etc. we are drawn to behave our selves more shamefastlie and
uprightly in his presence, then before the greatest majesty in the world,
Heb. 12, 28. By this is forbidden no reverence, less reverence unto the Lord,
then unto men, as before in love. The last is the fear of God: the fear of God
is when our with God, as loving him self more then God, was found meek,
humble, faithful and reverent toward his Father at all times, 1. Pet. 2. 22.
25. yet so as when we receive him thus our righteousness, we must receive him
our sanctification, that in all these things we may be holy, 1. Cor. 1. 30. 1.
Pet. 1. 13. to the end. Thus much of that commandment, which has prescribed
duties, directly teachinge to the person of the Lord.

Now follows that we owe him, but in the outward worship which he has
commanded. And first of the parts of it, in the second, then of the true use
in the third.

The second commandment.
In the second commandment we have first to consider the precept, then the
reason: The Precept has two parts, the first in the fourth verse, Exo. 20.
Thou shall not make to thy self any graven thing, or Image, or likeness of
any thing in heaven above, etc. In which part by a usual manner of the law, a
part being put for the whole, as in the 6. 7 8. commandments, and that one of
the fowlest look, to note the filthiness of the rest, we are forbidden
generally to acknowledge, love, delight in, desire, make or use being made,
any invention of men, either to present God, or to declare how he is affected
toward us, or to do any manner of worship unto him by, and is called the
whoring after our own heart, Ier. 13. 10. and 16. 13. and 18. 12 and 19. 5.
Col. 2. 22. 23. Esa. 29. 13. Mat. 15. 8. Now by the contrary is commanded, to
acknowledge, love, desire, delight in, and outwardly practice all those parts
of his worship, which he in his word has commanded, Deu. 12. 32. Ioh. 4. 22.
2. King. 17. 26. In the second in like manner is forbidden by one sort to
acknowledge, love, etc. any other use of any rite or outward means used in the
worship or service of god, the^ he has ordained, Ioh. 4. 22. 2. kin. 18. 4. By
the contrary commanded to acknowledge, love, etc. only the proper use of every
rite and outward means which the Lord has ordained: so to receive the
Sacraments as pledges of our conjunction with Christ, the remission of sins
in him, etc. not to make them a sacrifice for the quick and dead, not to bow
down and worship the^: so to receive the Ministers as the messengers of God, to
reco^cile us by the gospel, to forgive us our sins by the word, to command us
our duty, etc. But yet as instruments, 2. Cor. 5. 18. Matthew. 18. 18. And
therefore may not worship the^, sacrifice to them, etc. Acts. 10. 16. and 14.
13. And this is the true sense of the commandment.

Now let us see what particulars are forbidden, and what commanded. First we
see forbidden in the first part, the making of Images, to liken God, or to
worship him, whether graven or painted, Ro^. 4. 12. Ezec. 8. 10. Ioh. 5. 21. No
Image of God must be made, or reverence is kept, Psalm 16. 4. As all marriages,
conjunctions, or near familiarity with Idolaters, 2. Cor. 6. 14. Deuteronomy. 17. 3.
4. 2. Chro. 19. 1. 2. Genesis 24. 3. and 28. 1. and 34. 14. Likewise all relics
of Idolatry, which we must pollute and mar, not doing any service or honor,
no not giving the^ any estimation, 2. Cor. 6. and 17. Esai. 30. 22. 2. Chron.
29. 5. Hitherto of certain particulars forbidden. Now follow some
commanded, as the outward means, which the Lord has commanded in his
word: They are of two sorts,

either such as the Lord commands us to give him for his honor: or those
which he gives us to use in his service, Esai 45. 23.


Of the first sort, are ordinary, which are several actions of our body,
christia^ly according to the custom of the church, commanded in the word of
God, and orderly and reverently ordered in his service. Special, the fruit of
the lips, in Prayer and Thanksgiving Heb. 13. 15. Dan. 6. 11. Psalm. 55. 18.
Extraordinary fasting.


Of the actions of the body orderly and reverently used, are bowing of our
bodies, Esa. 45. 23. Reverent attention declared sometimes by rising up, Ge.
49. 33. 1 Chro. 28. 2. Number. 23. 22. 2. Kin. 23. 2. 2. Chron. 34 31. Neh. 8. 6.
Also lifting up of the hands and eyes, etc. Psa. 123. 1. and 141. 2. For even
as a husband looks that he alone should have not only the heart, but also the
reverent and loving behauior of the body, 1. Pet. 3. 6. Ge. 26. 8. So the Lord
requires these, both as testimonies of our sincerity, as also helps of our
infirmity, when we may co^uenientlie use them, and forbids to do in like
manner to any besides him. The great carelessness and negligence in these, and
the fruit of the lips in prayer, and praise of the Lord, is condemned by the
example of Solomon, 1. King. 8. 22. Dan. 6. 11. And of Christ, Mark 7. 34.
Matthew. 26. 36. To these sometimes also to help when our prayers, and
confessions, and hearings, etc. must be more earnest and lively: because our
great sins, necessities, etc. Then is fasting added, which And thus much of
those which the Lord in mercy and wisdom receives of us. Now follows
those means which he has given us, and they are either attributed unto the
Lord him self directly, as his titles to be used either simply, Ro^. 95 1.
Tim. 1. 17. in an oath, deu. 6. 13. Ier. 12.26. Esa. 18. 18. Or his works.
or given of him by man his ministry his word, Sacraments, and order of the
Church.


His works are given, not to worship them, which is forbidden, Deu. 4. 12.
But to see and behold and praise in them his wisdom, goodness, power, etc.
Psalm. 67. 13. and 104. 1. and 107. 42. Psalm. 64. 10. 11. His word he has
given, that we should read and meditate in the same day and night, to confer of
it with our wives, children, servants, privately at home, Deu. 6. 7. Psalm. 1.
1. and 119. 55. The Sacraments also has he given not to be neglected, as most
excellent pledges of his sure favor and mercy in Christ Romans 4. 11. and 6. 3.
4. Ephe. 5. 26. 1. Cor. 11 23. The order of his Church set down in his word,
Heb. 3. 2. 1. Chron. 28, 12, 19. and 2. Chron. 29. 25. and 1. Chro. 15. 13. 1.
Co. 9. 8 For ruling of his Church, by his word, Rulers who have the care of
souls committed to them, Heb. 13. 17. James 5. 14. Acts 14. 23. And some of
them resurrection be made lively to serve the Lord sincerely according to his
will.

Now follows the reason, which is drawn from a double property of the Lord:
his Jealousy in wrath, and his mercy. For I the Lord thy God. i Even then
being joined unto thee by my merciful covenant, as a husband to his wife,
Chap. 19. 6. A strong God. The first title is added to note his great power, to
do what he will, so that being preswaded in the first property of his
readiness to punish, and in the second of his readiness to reward. And first
in this of his power we need not to doubt at all, and such use we should make
of his Titles. Psalm. 2. 12. 115. 3. 10. Jealous. This is a kind of speech
taken from married folks, Hos. 2. 2. Ezech 16. who cannot abide their wives,
should give either in affection, or in gesture, countenance or any manner of
behavior to others, that which appertains to them only: and by this we
gather the greatness of the sins, either of gross Idolatry, or any
countenance unto it.

This Jealousy he sets further forth by the fruit that the Lord punishes
severely this sin. Visitinge iniquity. i punishing this sin or the
transgressio^ of this law in dissoluing this holy band: for so the general
word Iniquity, and evil is taken sometimes for some special great sin, as
Deuteronomy. 17. 2. Psalm. 78. 39. And here it appears that it must be so taken,
because it is not a reason of the whole law, but of this commandment only
This is further declared by the persons on whom it falls. The thrd and fourth
generation. which is both because by the fathers sin disanulling the
covenant by Idolatry, the child falls out of the same, and continuing in
that fall, is punished justly for his own sin, and his fathers both. Mat.
23. 25. And therefore that which is added declares those which are punished.
Those that hate me. That is those that securely commit spiritual whoredom
against this commandment: and so this is nothing contray to that. Ezech. 18.
Exercising benignity. This is the second property wherein the Lord
declares his reward toward the keeper of this Law, that is, free liberality
or bounty (for so the word signifies) in receiving them into a covenant of
life and blessedness, yea and that eternal. Act. 2. 37. Out of this we
learn that as a child to his father, when we shall do all that is
commanded, we are our father leave us no patrimony, are we less bound to
do our duty, so if the Lord had not bound himself by his covenant, which
came from his free and undeserved goodness, could we have claymed any thing by
fulfilling, because we did but our duty, for the mercy of creating us in
great dignity according to his own likeness in holiness and righteousness. But
now having so many times offended since the knoweledge of his grace, and lying
in his wrath, both by natural corruption and continual serving of sin from
the same daily, how is it not mercy only, without all deserving, when he
gives us by To thousand generations, which shows that the Lord in respect
of us sets his mercy above his justice. But he sets them forth by their
fruits that be pertakers of it. That love him, and keep his commandments. By
love he notes that this should be the fountain from which the outward
obedience of this commandment should spring, so that if that we love not,
delight not, in the parts of his worship, because in truth we love him and
his glory. These things are abominable. John. 14. 23. His commandments. Here
as iniquity was put for the spiritual whordome against this commandment, so
commandments are put for the several parts of obedience in this precept as
the circumstance of the place does show, by which we see all good intentes are
shut out. As they have been severely punished of the Lord. Deuteronomy. 4. 15. Esaias.
30. 21. 1. Chron. 15. 13. and 2. Chron. 13. 10. 11.

Hitherto of that commandment which has prescribed us the several parts or
outward means which we must love, desire, etc. in his worship, which we give
him.

3. Command.
In this commandment as before we must consider, first the percept, then the
reason. The precept is, Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain. And so by similitude is applied to the taking of his name with.
ourtongue, hands. or any use of it.
Take, that is: make any use: for the word signifies to take up, or lift up on
our shoulders. The name of God is his memorial amongst men which being in his
titles most properly is geuin to them, whether drawn from his nature as
Jehovah the Lord, or his properties, just, holy, merciful, etc. The God of
Abraham, Jacob, etc. Exodus 3, 15. Hence because the Lord in excellency is
remembered in his works, by likeness they are called his name. Psalm. 8. 2. 2.
Chro. 6. 32.. Much more his Gospel. Acts. 9. 15. His Sacraments. Mar. 5. 6.
Also true prayer is the honoring of his name, and evil the profaning of the
same. Ge. 4. 26. Mal. 1. 11. 12. Therefore here he comprehends al these, and
forbids to use vainly, that is, irreverently and rashly falsely, or
hypocritically, lightly and unprofitably, all which are uttered by the Hebrew
word: so that by the contrary here is commanded to know, allow, love desire,
and practice the true use of GOD his name in all the outward means of his
worship, by being prepared reverently to take it up, by bringing the proper
affections in the use of it, and by shooting at that most profitable end, which
he has appointed for every one Al which we must consider in every of them
severally and first in those things, which having imprinted his name in them,
he has given us, and those which are directly attributed to him, his titles,
and works. His titles according to the double use of them simply, or in an
oath has double caution set down in the word. In the simple use we must be
prepared either by premeditation, or else by some occasion going before, which
does stir up the several affections of the heart in the use of them. Romans
9. 5. 1. Tim. 4* 17. 2. Chron. 24. 22. Here is forbidden the usual taking up
of the titles of God, not having our affection prepared to the reverent use of
them: by any of these means, the proper affection here must be according to
the title and use of it, as in the example of Zach. 2. Chron. 24 22.. Being
lead by the occasion of their unjust and unmerciful dealing with him, had a
full persuasion and feeling of the sight and justice of the Lord. and so made
use of that glorious title the Lord to terrify them, and to bring them to
repentance. The use of his titles must be eithet to set forth directly the
honor of God: his nature, power, mercy, justice, etc. as Romans 9. 5. Tit. 2.
13. Or to make profitte unto men either our Or in blasphemy. Leuit, 14. 11.
When we use the name of God in an oath, according to the excellency of this
duty, we must be diligently prepared by earnest and sufficient consideration
of the person of the Lord, to whose judgment we commit our selves, of the
cause and matter where about we swear with all other circumstances
appertaining thereto. Eccle. 5. 2. Gene. 24. 5. Whereto appertained the
ceremony of lifting up their hands unto the Lord, which called them to mind
with whom they had in this cause to deal. Gene. 14. 22. So sometimes they added
or put it steed of the creatures of life, heaven, earth, afflictions, or
snfferings not to give the honor of an oath unto the^ which were abominable.
Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Esaias. 18. 18. 1. Kings. 8. 31. Heb. 16. 17. But to affect their
hearts the more with reverence of him, his glory of power, or mercy, or
justice, which were most sensible in those things. 1. Sam. 20 3. Math. 5. 34.
1. Cor. 15. 31. To which, if the names of Idolles be added, as it takes away
this use, so it is abominable. Hag. 8. 14. Zephan. 1. 5. Here is forbidden all
careless rushing to oaths, without due consideration, yea though the causes be
just. Eccle. 9. 4. Iere. 4. 2. The second thing is, with all reverent behavior
in the action it self, to have a sincere and upright heart, as well in the fear
of God to hallow his name, as to help the truth in necessity: which is
called swearing in truth. Iere. 4. 2. The end is to make known a very
weighty truth, which cannot by any other means be so conveniently known,
And this is to swear for a just cause. Iere. 4. 2. Hebr. 6. 16. Here again is
forbidden rash and common oaths, not taken up for such a cause. Eccle. 9. 4.
Math. 5. 34. False oaths, Perjury. Leu. 19. 12. Deu. 5. 11. And thus much of
titles. Now follows of the works of God. For the works of God, any special
preparation, besides that which is not general, I have not found. The
affection which is proper in the dilligent consideration of the^ is great
reverence and sweet feeling of the glory of God, which any manner of way is
found in them. Psalm. 64. 9. 10. and 104. 34. We contrariwise either wholly
neglect the^, as Esa. 6. 12. or else in lightness, jesting, etc. in which sort
we speak sometime of women, sometime of holy matrimony, yea sometime of the
joys of heaven, and pains of hell, making foolish and vain plays of these
things. The use or end of all the work of the Lord toward him, to preach
and set forth the power and glory of the eternal kingdom of God. Psalm. 145.
11. 12. To us, that we and our posterity may better know, trust, love, and
fear the Lord, Psalm. 78. 7. Deuteronomy. 4. 9. But contrariwise, we never make any
such use, but harden our hearts against all his works, both of justice and
mercy, thereby declaringe our palpable blindness in such light, Psalm. 111. 2.
and 92. 6. 7. and 10. 5. And thus much for the true sanctifying of the name of
god, in those things which are directly attributed unto him. Now follows
the other in the private exercise of his word in reading, co^ferring, etc. We
must be prepared in our hearts, by a great reverence of the most heavenly,
most constant and profitable wisdom of the Lord for us, contained therein,
Psalm. 119. 129. By a sure hope to find understanding in the plain light of
the Lord, Psalm. 119. 130. Pro. 8. 9. By an earnest prayer unto the Lord for
the true understanding, feeling, and practice of the same, proceeding from a
hungry soul after these graces, Psalm. 119. 131, etc. Here is condemned our
great want in all these things, which come commonly at all adventure, without
any due consideration of this most holy exercise, in the reading, conferring,
etc. it self, we must draw our whole soul to mark, weigh, and attend upon
wholly, which is set forth by lifting up our hands unto the Law, to meditate
in it, by searching and ^^^inge, etc. Psalm. 119. 48. Also a bowing down to
look unto it, Iam. 1. 25. Psalm. 119. 15. To incline our heart to
understanding, to cry after wisdom, to search for it as for hidd treasure,
Pro. 2. 3. Here again our great coldness, wavering minds, and multitude of
other like infirmities is condemned. The end is. that we may apply all unto
ourselves, examine our hattes by it, and so in calling on the Lord, wholly to
endeavor our selves to put it in practice, Psalm. 19. 26. 27. and 59. 60. Pro.
2. 1. Here is condemned the profane abusinge of the same in iestes, plays,
etc. Pro. 13. 13. 14. In the order of the Church, as the means are more
glorious and exellent, so we must prepare our selves more earnestly on every
side, Eccle. 5. 1. To the Lord, in the person of the Minister who^ we must
receive as the Lord, Romans 10. 15. 2. Cor. 5. 19. 20. Speaking his word
truly, Deuteronomy. 18. 18. 19. which these are ordained, as we will show in some
of the principal particulars. In the exercise of the word preached, being
the way to of the Lord in his servants, give praise and thanks unto the Lord
with the Church. Mat. 26. 30. The use is after in all temptations to receive
comfort and relief by them, Psalm. 51. 9. Of one correction, for the rest, as
of excommunication: the preparation is by the authority and majesty of
Christ, the action a fearful sentence with Majesty, justly prouounced, the
use for the sleaing of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day
of the Lord, 1. Cor. 5. 4. 5. The reason follows: for he will not hold him
innocent that takes his name in vain. That is, he will condemn him, as Saint
James and Saint Paul write, the one against rash swearing, and the other of
the abuse of the Sacraments interprets, Above all things swear not my
brethren, etc. least you fall into condemnation, Iam. 5. 12. 1. Cor. 11. 29. 34.

4. Command.
Hitherto those precepts, which command duties in the worship of the Lord,
which we owe every day unto him.

Now follows that duty which one day in seven must be given unto the
Lord, in the sanctification of his Saboth. Remember, So he seems to speak,
because when as this commandment was before given, they had neglected the
same. The Saboth day to sanctify, that is, to separate it from a common use,
and dedicate it to a peculiar and holy use unto the Lord. So the gold, the
vessels, etc. were said to be holy and dedicated for the holy use of the
Temple, and might not be given or put to any other use: To sanctify a Saboth
therefore, is to call our selves, not from our own sinful ways, which we must
do every day, but from out honest and lawful callings, that giving our selves
to godly and christianly exercises of our faith, we may be strengthened in
the ways of God, and so in thought, word, and deed consecrate a glorious
Saboth unto the Lord. Therefore it is called the Saboth of God, Exodus 20. 10.
and Leui. 23. 3. He calls it a holy convocation, that is, dedicated to holy
meetings. So Esai 58. 13. Hereby is confuted their opinion that take it a
Saboth kept, if they rest from their labors, so in the mean time they labor
in plays, dauncings, vain songs and enterluds, etc. as though the Lord had
called us from our profitable labor commanded, to displease him in these
vanities. Again others also who if they be better then the former, abstayning
from those things, have notwithstanding their heads, hearts, and mouths, so
full of worldly things, as they do not in deed perform the truth of the
Saboth, when as it should be kept as the rest of the Law, not only in action,
but also in the thoughts of the heart and words of the mouth. Esa. 58. Amos.
8. 5. But before we come to the proper and peculiar exercises, we will set
down reasons that prove it perpetual for the Church in this world, to have
one such day in seven to be dedicated unto the Lord, that so we may have the
use of it in our conscience, and of the ceremony ceased I will speak in the
end. First because of the covenant of the law, which bids us do and so
live thereby, driving us unto Christ, Romans 10. 5. There are ten parts, called
ten words or sentences, of which if we take away this, there will be but nine,
Exodus 34. 18. Secondly, if Adam being in his soundnes, because his mind not
being infinite, could not do and keeping the garden, Gene. 2. 15. every day,
but was further able one whole day in soul and body to give over him self to
the former Saboth, exercise of praying, praising, etc. either we must not
know, and not be borne again to this piece of excellency, or else we must
have this peculiar commandment to humble us, and in this point to drive us
unto Christ, afterward also be a rule and square unto us of the same. Fourthly,
the Apostles in taking this day, and giving it the name of the Lords day,
Apoc. 1. 10. as before that was called the Lords Saboth, and ordayning public
exercises, Acts 10. 7. and private, 1. Cor. 4. 2. As they did show that in
the particular seventh day it was ceremonial: so in the common necessity it
was perpetual according to the foresaid equity. Last of all, as Calvin
says unto the papists, of the second commandment, who also said, that
was ceremonial and abolished* as long as we feel the grosenes of our nature
to inuente false worship, framing Images of God: so long that must remain to
humble us, even so, as long as we do feel our corruption, in accounting the
Saboth impossible, and so omitting and profaning it, so long we will hold it
to be perpetual. Now the Lord to help our infirmities, has given us
variety of profitable exercises to be occupied in, and to recreate us as it
were in an other, being weary of one.

They are either Public Nehem. 8. 5. 13. or Private. Nehem. 8. 5. 13.


Public is to join with the church from the beginning to the endinge in the
hearing of the word preached, in praying, and administering of the Sacraments.
Eze. 46. 1. 2. 3. 10. Nehe. 9. Esd. 3. Act. 15. 20. 21. and 17. 1. and 18. 4.
Luke 4. 11. 2. Kings 4. 23. Private exercises are for our selves to increase
godliness, for others their comfort. Nehe. 8. 13.

Of the first sort are reioicing in the word received, and profiting by that.
Also meditations, conference, etc. on the works of God, that so we might not
only by doctrine, but by experience be taught, and so be brought to greater
feeling, as is commanded, Deuteronomy. 5. 20. For other, we are commanded duties of
love in relieuinge, and comfortinge the needy, as well bodily by our help, as
spiritually by comfort and conference out of the word, edifying one another in
our most holy faith, 1. Corin. 14. 2. Mat. 12. In these things our contempt,
and neglect both of the mercy of the Lord, who has ordained so many good
means to increase our knowledge, our feelinge in the faith and good works,
his wisdom, who having regard to our weakness, has given us such great
variety, that always being weary of the one, we may breath our selves in the
other. In this as in the rest, and the commandment going before, we must have
the sins forgiven in the son of God his obedience here, Luke 13. 10. to the
18. verse, Luke 13. 4. 5. In him also we must receive power with this former
grace to die unto this sin, and rise unto this part of obedience.

Now follows the reason whereby he does both make plain the obedience, and
allure us unto it. He allureth, because he gives this equity perpetual,
that seeinge in six days we may do all our work, which is necessary for
the maintenance of this life, and provision of our families, which is declared
by these oppositions in the 9. and 10. verses. Six days thou shall work, but
the seventh is the rest or Saboth of the Lord thy God. In six days do all
thy work, in the seventh do no work, but of the Saboth. Mat. 12. 5. The
Saboth unto the Lord, Here, as in that before, are the papists confuted, who
ordained Saboths to Saints and Angels, a worship due to the Lord only, who
also took away this liberty of six days wholly, and too often.

No manner of work, except for frugall necessity of putting on of appareil,
of meat, drink, etc. which must be as means to help and succor the
weakness of tender and old age, the strength of strong men in this exercise,
who if they should ordinarely abstain on that day from these things, it would
make them much unable to accomplish that work of the Lord, and so it is
expounded, Luke 13. 15. Wherefore that of Exodus 35. 3. was a rudiment
ceremonial, whereby they were instructed to the reverence of the same, when as
otherwise they might do great things. This is further declared by a
distribution of the efficient causes. Thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter,
nor thy Servant. By which we see we do not rightly observe the Saboth,
except all with in our gates, that is, our authority, (so called, because they
bound the proper place of every man where he exercises any authority) do
likewise sanctify the same. The second reason is drawn from the example of
the Lord him self, the more to allure us and move us, who contend to come
near the excellent. so Christ gave an example for us to follow. For the Lord
made heaven and earth in six days, but the seventh he rested. By that seventh
day, he poynteth out the Jews Saboth, the seventh from the creation, to the
which day they were never precisely tied, because being the seventh it carried
a note of perfection, and so did shadow out the excellency of our rest under
Christ, Heb. 4. 20. and therefore because that was ceremonial, that proper day
was pointed out to Adam, Genesis 2.

Whereas if this had not bin ceremonial, he had not needed, because the moral
equity of one in seven, was written in his heart, as above has been noted.
And thus as it was a figure of our sanctification and adoption, it was not a
piece of the first table, but rather general to the whole law, and therefore
in that respect is abolished. Col. 2. 16.

The end of the first Table.
All glory to the Lord.
