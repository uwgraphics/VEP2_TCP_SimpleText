THE DIVINE POEM OF MVSAEVS.

First of all BOOKS.

TRANSLATED According to the Original,

By GEO: CHAPMAN*

LONDON, Printed by Isaac Iaggard. 1616.

To the Most generally ingenious, and our only Learned Architect, my exceeding
good Friend INYGO JONES, Esquire; Surueigher of His Majesty's Works.
ANcient Poesy, and ancient Architecture, requiring to their excelle^ce a like
creating and proportionable Rapture, and being alike ouer-topt by the monstrous
Babels of our Modern Barbarism; Their unjust obscurity, letting no glance of
their truth and dignity appear, but to passing few: To passing few is their
lest appearance to be presented. Your self then being a Chief of that few, by
whom Both are apprehended; and their beams worthily measured and valew'd. This
little Light of the one, I could not but object, and publish to your choice
apprehension; especially for your most ingenuous Love to all Works, in which
the ancient Greek Souls have appeared to you. No less esteeming this, worth
the presenting to any Greatest, for the smalnes of the wo^ke; then the Author
himself has been held therefore of the less estimation: h^uing obtained as
much preservation and honor, as the greatest of Others: the Smalnesse being
supplied with so greatly-exc^llent Invention and Elocution. Nor lacks even the
most youngly-enamor'd affection it co^taines, a Temper grave enough, to become,
both the Sight and Acceptance of the Grauest. And therefore, howsoever the
mistaking world takes it (whose left hand ever receyu'd what I gave with my
Right.) If you freely and nobly ^ntertaine it, I obtain my End: your Judicious
Loves continuance, being my only Object: To which I at all parts commend.

Your Ancient poor Friend George Chapman.
To the Commune Reader.
WHen you see Leander and Hero, the Subjects of this Pamphlet; I persuade my
self, your prejudice will increase to the contempt of it; either headlong
presupposing it, all one; or at no part matcheable, with that partly excellent
Poem, of Master Marloes. For your all one; the Works are in nothing alike; a
different Character being held through, both the Style, Matter, and invention.
For the match of it; let but your eyes be Matches, and it will in many parts
ouermatch it. In the Original, it being by all the most Learned, the
incomparable Loue-Poem of the world. And I would be something sorry, you could
justly tax me, with doing it any wrong in our English; though perhaps it
will not so amble under your seasures and censures, as the before published.

Let the great Comprehenders, and unable Vtterers of the Greek elocution in
other Language; drop under their vnlodings, how humbly soever they please; and
the rather disclaim their own strength, that my weakness may seem the more
presumptnous: It can impose no scruple the more burden on my shoulders, that I
will feel; unless Reason chance to join Arbiter with Will, and appear to
me: To whom I am ever prostrately subject. And if envious Misconstruction
could once leave tyrannizing over my unfortunate Innocence; Both the Charity it
argu'de, would render them that use it, the more Christian; and me
industrious, to hale out of them the discharge of their own Duties.

OF MVSAEVS*
Out of the worthy D. Gagers Coll^ctions.
MVsae^s was a renowned Greek Poet, borne at Athens, the Son of Eumolpus.
He lived in the time of Orpheus, and is said to be one of them that went
the Famous voy^ge to Colchos for the Golden Fleece. He wrote of the Gods
Genealogy before any other, and invented the Sphere. Whose opinion was, that
all things were made of one matter, and resolved into one again. Of whose
works, only this one Poem of Hero and Leander, is extant; of himself in his
sixte Book of Aene. Virgil, makes memorable mention, where in Elisium he
makes Sybilla speak this of him. Musaeum ante Omnes
(medium nam plurima Tu^ba
Hunc habet) atque humeris
extantem suspicit altis.
He was borne in Falerum, a Town in the middle of Tuscia, or the famous
Country of Tuscany in Italy, called also Hetruria.

Of Abydus and Sestus.
ABydus and Sestus, were two ancient Towns: One, in Europe, another in Asia;
East and West, opposite: On both the shores of the Hellespont. Their names are
exta^t in Maps to this day. But in the^r places, are two Castles buile, which
the Turks call Bogazossar, that is, Castles situate by the Sea side. Seamen
now call the place where Sestus stood, Malido. It was likewise called
Possidonium. But Abydus is called Au^o. They are both renowned in all Writers,
for nothing so much as the Love of Leander and Hero.

Of the Hellespont.
HEllespont is the straits of the two Seas, Propontis and Egeum runn^ng betwixt
Abydus and Sestus. Over which, Xerxes builte a Bridge, and joined these two
Towns together, conueighing over his Army of seven hundred thousand men. It
is now called by some, The Streights of G^llipolis. But by Frenchmen, Flemings,
and others, The Arm of Saint George. It had (...) name of Hellespo^t, because
Hell the Daughter of Athamas K. of Thebes, was drowned in it. And therefore of
one it is called, The Virgin-killing-Sea. Of another, The Virgin-Sea. It is but
seven Italian Furlongs broad, which is one of our Miles, lacking a furlong.

MVSAEVS OF HERO and LEANDER.
Goddess relate,
the witnesse-bearing-light
Of Loves, that would not bear
a humane sight.
The Seaman
that transported Marriages
Shipped in the Night;
his bosom plowing th'seas:
The Love joys
that in gloomy cloud: did fly
The clear beams
of the immortal mornings eye.
Abydus and fair Sestus,
where I hear
The Night-hid Nuptials
of young Hero were.
Leanders swimming to her*
and a Light:
A Light, that was
administresse of sight
To cloudy Venus;
and did serve ^'addresse
Night-wedding Heroes
Nuptial (1) Offices.
A Light that took
the very form of Love:
Which had been Justice
in aethereall Jove,
When the Nocturnal
duty had been done,
T'aduance amongst the
Consort of the Sun;
And call the Star,
that Nuptial Loves di^ guide,
And to the Bridegroom (^) gave,
and graced the B^ide
Because it was
(3) Companion to the Death
Of Loves, whose kind cares
cost their dearest breath:
And that (4) Fame-^reight^d ship
from Shipwreck kept,
Tha^ such ^weet Nuptials brought,
they never slept.
Till Air was with
a Bitter flood inflate,
That bore their firm Loves
as infixte a hate.
But ( Goddess) forth;
and Both, one ys^ue sing:
The Light extinct,
Leander perishing.
Two towns there were,
that with one Sea were wald;
Built near, and Opposi^e:
this, Sestus called;
Abydus that:
Then LOV^ his Bow bent hy,
And at both Cities,
let one Arrow fly.
That Two (a Virgin
and a Youth) Infl^m'd:
The Youth, was
sweetly grac'^ Leander named*
The Virgin, Hero*
S^stus, she renownes,
Abydus ^e, in Birth:
of both which Towns
Both were the Beuty-circled
stars; And Both,
Graced with like looks,
as with one Love and Troth.
If that way lie thy course,
seek for my sake,
A Tower, that Se^^ian Hero
once d^d make
Her Watchtower:
and a Torch stood holding there,
By which, Leander
his Sea-course did stere.
Seek likewise,
of Abydus ancient Towers,
The Roaring Sea
lamenting to these hours
Leanders Love, and Death.
But say; how came
He (at Abydus borne)
to feel the flame
Of Heroes Love at Sestus?
and to bind
In Chains of equal fire,
bright Heroes mind?
The Gracef^ll Hero,
borne of gentle blood*
Was Venus Priest;
and since she understood
No Nuptial Language:
from her Parents, she
Dwelt in a Tower,
that ouer-lookt the Sea.
For shamefastness and chastity,
she reigned
Another Goddess*
Nor was ever traind
In Women's companies;
Nor learned to t^ed
A graceful Dance,
to which such years are bred.
The enu^ous spights of Women
she did fly,
(Women for Beauty
their own sex envy)
All her Devotion
was to Venus done,
And to his heavenly Mother,
her great Son
Would reconcile,
with Sacrifices ever;
And ever trembled
at his flaming Quiver.
Yet escaped not so
his fiery shafts, her Breast*
For now, the popular
Venerean Feast,
Which to Adoni^,
and great Cyprias State,
The Sestians yearly
vs'de to celebrate,
Was Come:
and to that holy day came all,
That in the bordering Isles,
the Sea did wall.
To it in Flocks they flew;
from Cyprus these,
Enuiron'd with the rough
Carpathian Seas:
These from Haemonia;
nor remained a Man
Of all the Towns,
in ^h'Isles Cytherean:
Not one was left,
that vs'de to dance upon
The (...)
of ^dorifferous Libanon:
Not one of Phrygia,
not one of All
The Neigh^or^,
seated near the Festival:
Nor one
of opposite Abydus Shore*
Non^ of all these*
that Virgins favors wore
Were absent:
All such, fill the flowing way,
When Fame proclaims
a solemn holy da^.
Not bent so much
to offer holy Flames,
As to the Beauties
of assembled Dames.
The Virgin Hero
entered th'oly place,
And graceful beams
cast round about her face,
Like to the bright Orb
of the rising Moon.
The Top-spheres of her
snowy cheeks pus on
A glowing redness,
like the two hu'de Rose,
Her odorous Bud
begi^ning to disclose.
You would have said,
in all her Li^eaments
A Medd^^ full of Ro^es
she presents
All over her she blush't;
which (putting on
Her white Robe,
(reaching to her Ankles) shone,
(While she in passi^g,
did he^ feet dispose)
As she had wholly been
a moving Rose.
Graces, in Numbers,
from her parts did flow:
The Ancients therefore
(^ince they did not know
Heroes vnb^unde^ Beauties)
fal^ely fa^n'd
Only ^hree Graces:
for when Hero strained
Into a smile,
her Priestly Modesty,
A hundred Graces, grew,
from either ^ye.
A fit o^e sure,
the Cyprian Godd^sse found
To be her Ministresse;
And so highly crowned
With worth, her Grace was,
past all other Dames,
That, of a Priest
made to the Queen^ of Flames
A New Queen of them,
She in all eyes shin'de:
And did so undermine
each tender mind
Of all the yong-men:
that the^e was not One
But wished fair Hero were his wife,
or None.
Nor could she stir
about the wel-built Phane,
This way, or that;
but every way she wan
A following mind in all Men:
which their ^yes
Lighted with all
their inmost Faculties
Clearly confirmed:
And One (admiring) said;
All Spar^a I have trauail'd,
and survai'd
The City Lacedemon;
where we hear
All Beauties Labors,
and contentions were:
A woman yet,
so wise, and delicate
I never saw*
It may be, Venus gate
One of the younger Graces,
to supply
The place of Priest hood
to her Deity.
Even tyr'de I am with sight,
yet does not find
A ^a^isfac^ion,
by my si^ht; my Mind.
O could I once
ascend sweet Heroes bed,
Let me be straight
found in her bosom dead:
I would not wish
to be in heaven a God,
Were Hero here my wi^e:
But, if forbod
To lay proph^ne hands
on thy holy Priest,
O Venus,
with another such assist
My Nuptial Longings.
Thus prayed all that spoke,
The rest their wounds hid,
and in Frenzies b^ake
Her Beauties Fire,
being so suppressed, so raged.
But thou, Leander,
more then all engaged,
Would not when thou had
viewed th'amasing Maid
Waste with clo^e stings,
and seek no open aid;
But, with the ^^aming Arrows
of her eyes
Wounded unawares,
thou would in sacrifice
Vent th'inflammation
thy bu^nt blood did prove,
Or Li^e with sacred
Medicine of her Love.
Bu^ now the Loue-brand
in his eie-beam^s bu^n'd,
And with th'vnconquer'd fire,
his heart was turned
Into a Coal:
together wrought the Flame;
The virtuous beauty
of a spotle^^e Dame,
Sharper to Men is,
then the swiftest Shaft.
H^s Eye ^he way
by which his Heart is caught:
And from the stroke
his eye sustaines, the wound
Open's within,
and does his Intrailes sound.
Amaze then ^ooke him,
Impudence, and Shame
Made Earthquakes in him,
with their Frost and Flame:
His Heart betwixt them tossed,
till Reverence
Took all these Prisoners in him:
and from thence
Her mat^^less bea^ty,
with (...)
(...) b^nds:
(...) Aguish L^ue, that len^
Sh^me, and Observance,
Licenc'st their remove;
And wi^ely liking
Im^udence in Love:
S^l^nt he went,
an^ stood against the Maid,
And in side glances
^aintly he conuaide
His craf^y eyes about her;
with dumb shows
Tempting her mind to Error.
And now grows
She to conceive his subtle (...)
and joyed
Since he was graceful.
Then herself employed
Her womanish cunning,
turning from him qui^e
Her Lovely Countenance;
giving yet some Light
Even by her dark signs,
of her kindling fire;
With up and down-lookes,
whe^ting his desire.
He joyed at heart
to see Loves sense in her,
And no contempt
of what he did prefer.
And while he wished unseen
to urge the rest,
The day shrunk down
her beams to lowest West
And East: The Euen-starre
took vantage of her shade;
Then boldly he,
his kind ap^roches made:
And as he saw
the Russet clouds increase,
He strained her Ro^^e hand,
and held his peace:
But sighed,
as Silence had his bosom broke;
When She, as silent.
put on Angers cloak*
And drew her hand back.
He descerning well
Her would, and would not:
to her boldlier fell:
And her elaborate Robe,
with much cost wrought,
About her waste e^bracing:
On he brought
His Love to ^h'in-parts
of the reverend Ph^ne:
She, (as her Loue-sparkes
more and more did wane)
Went slowly on,
and with a woman's words
Threatening Leander,
thus his boldness bords.
Why Stranger, Are you mad?
^ll-fated Man,
Why hale you thus,
a Virgin Sestian?
Keep on your way:
Let go, Fea^e to offend
The Noblesse of my birthrights,
^ither Friend;
It ill become's you
to solicit thus
The Priest of Venus;
Hopeless, dangerous
The barred vp-way
is to a Virgins bed.
Thus, for the Maiden form,
she menaced.
But he well knew.
that when these Female mind^s
Break out in fury,
they are certain signs
Of their persuasions.
Women's threats once shown,
Shows in it, only,
all you wish your Own:
And therefore
of the rubi-coloured Maid,
The odorous Neck
he with a kiss assaid.
And stricken with the sting
of Love, he pra^'d.
Dear Venus,
next to Venus you must go;
And next Minerua;
^race Minerua to
Your like, with ^arthly Dames
no light can show:
To Io^es great Dau^hters,
^ must liken you.
Blessed was thy great Begetter;
blessed was she
Whose womb did bear thee*
But m^st blessedly
The Womb it self fared,
that thy throws did prove.
O hear my prayer:
pity the Need of Love.
As Priest of Venus,
practice Venus Rites.
Come, and instruct me
in her Beds del^ghts.
It fits not you, a Virgin,
to vow aides
To Venus service;
Venus Loves no Maids.
If Venus institutions
you prefer,
And faithful Ceremonies
vow to her,
Nupt^als, and Beds they be.
If her Love binds,
Love loves swe^t Laws,
that sof^en humane minds.
Make me your servant:
Husband, if you pleased;
Whom Cupid with his
burning shafts has ^eis'd,
And ^un^ed to you;
As swift Hermes ^raue
With his Gold Rod,
JOVE'S bold son to be slave
To Lydia's sovereign virgin;
But for me*
Venus insulting,
forced my feet to thee.
I was not guided
by wise Mercury.
Virgin, you know,
When Atalanta fled
Out of Arcadia,
kind Melanions bed,
(Affecting Virgin life;
your Angry Queen,
Whom first she used
with a malignant spleen)
At last possessed him
of her complete heart.
And you (dear Love)
because I would auer^
Your Goddess anger;
I would feign persuade.
With these Loue-luring words,
conformed he made
The Maid Recusant
to his bloods desire;
And set her soft mind,
on an erring fire.
Dumb s^e was struck:
and down to earth she threw
Her Rosy eyes:
hid in Vermillion hew,
Made red with shame.
Often with her foot she rac't
Earths upper part;
And often (as quite vngrac't)
About her shoulders
gathered up her weed.
All these fore^tokens are
that Men shall speed.
Of a persuaded Virgin
to her Bed,
Promise is most giu^n,
when the least is said.
And now she took in,
Loves sweet bitter sti^g*
Burned in a fire,
that cooled her ^urfetting*
Her Beauties likewise,
struck her Friend amazed:
For while her eyes
fixed on the Pauement gazed,
Love, on Leanders looks,
showed Fury seas'd.
Never enough
hi^ greedy eyes were pleased
To view the fair gloss
of her tender Neck.
At last this sweet voice past,
and out did brea^e
A ruddy moisture
from her bashful eyes;
Stranger, perhaps
thy words might exercise
Motion in F^ints,
as well as my soft breast.
Who taught thee words*
that err from East to West
In their wild libe^ty?
O woe is me:
To this my Nati^e soil,
who guided thee?
All thou have said is vain;
for how can thou
(Not to be trusted:
One, I do not know)
Hope to excite in me,
a mixed Love?
It Is clear, that Law
by no means will approve
Nuptials with us;
for thou can never gain
My Paren^^ ^races.
If thou (...) remain
Close on my shore,
as outcast from thine own;
Venus will be
in darkest corners known
Man's tongue is friend to scandal;
loose acts done
In surest secret:
in the open Sun
And every Market place,
will burn thine cares.
But say, what name ^ustainst thou?
What soil bea^^s
Name of thy Country?
M^ne, I cannot hide;
My far spread name, is Hero:
I abide
Housed in an all-seene-Towre*
whose tops touch heaven,
Built on a steep shore,
that to Sea is driven
Before the City Sestus.
One sole Maid
Attending;
And this irksome life is laide^
By my austere Friends wills,
on one so young;
No like-year'd Virgins nere;
No youthful throng
To meet in some delights,
Dances, or so:
But Day and Night,
the windy Sea does throw.
Wild murmuring cuff^s
about our deafned ears.
This said: her white Robe,
hid her Cheeks like spheres.
And then (with shame-affected,
since she vs'de
Words, that desired youths;
and her Friends accused*)
She blamed her self for them,
and them for her.
Mean space,
Leander felt Loves Arrow err
Through all his thoughts;
devising how he might
Encounter Love,
that dared him so to fight.
Mind changing Love
wounds men, and cures again:
Those Mo^tals, over whom
he list's to reign,
The All-Tamer stoopes to:
in aduising how
They may with some ease
bear the yoke, his Bow
So, our Leander,
whom he hurt, he healed:
Who, hau^ng long
his hidden fire concealed,
And vex't with thoughts,
he thirsted to impart,
His stay he quitted,
wi^h this quickest Art.
Virgin, for thy Love,
I will swim a wave
That Ships denies:
And though with fire it rave*
In way to thy Bed,
all the Seas in one
I would despis^:
The Hellespont were none.
All Nights to swim
to one sweet bed with thee,
Were nothing;
if when Love had landed me,
All hid in weeds,
and in Veneran foam,
I brought (withal)
bright Heroes husbands home.
Not far from hence,
and just against thy Town
Abydus stands,
that my Birth cal's mine own.
Hold but a Torch then
in thy heauen-high Tower:
(Which I beholding,
to that starry Power
May plough ^he dark Seas,
as the Ship of Love.)
I will not care
to see Boots move
Down to the Sea:
Nor sharp Orion traile
His neuer-wet Carre;
but arrive my sail
Against my Country,
at thy pleasing shore.
But (dear) take heed,
that no ungentle blo're
Thy Torch extinguish,
bearing all the Light
By which my life sails,
least I lose thee quite.
Would thou my Name know
(as thou do my house)
It is Leander,
lovely Hero's Spouse.
Thus this kind couple,
their close Marriage made,
And friendship
ever to be held in shade,
(Only by witness
of one Nuptial Light.)
Both vowed: agreed,
that Hero every Night,
should hold her Torch out:
every Night, her Love
The tedious passage
of the Se^ should prove
The whole Even
of the watchful Nuptia^s spent,
Against their wills:
the stern power of constraint
Enforced their parting.
Hero to her Tower;
Leander,
(minding his returning hour)
Took of the Turret, Marks,
for fear he failed,
And to well-founded
broad Abydus ^ail'd.
All Night, Both thirsted
(...)
O^ each yong-ma^ri^d,
lovely Man, and Wife.
And all day after,
No desire shot home,
But that the Chamber-decking
Night were come.
and now, Nights ^ooty c^owd^s
clap't all (...) on,
Fraught all with sleep:
yet took L^^^der none.
But on th'oppos'd shore
of the noise-full Seas,
The Messenger
of glittering Marriages
Looked wishly for:
Or rather longed to see,
The witn^sse of their Light
to Misery,
Far of^ discovered
in their Covert bed.
When Hero saw
the blackest Curtain spread
Tha^ veiled the da^ke night:
her bright Torch she showed.
Whose Light no so^ner
th'eager Lou^r vi^w'd:
But Love, his blood set
on as bright a Fire.
Together burned ^he Torch,
and his Desire.
But hearing of the Sea,
the horrid rore,
With which, the tender air
the mad waves tore:
At first he trembled:
But at last he reared
High as the storm his spir^^,
and thus cheered,
(Using these words to it)
his resolute mind*
Love d^eadfull is;
The Sea, with naught inclinde:
But Sea, is Water;
outward all his ire,
When Love lights his fear
with an inward (...).
Take fire (my heart)
fear naught that flits and raues:
Be Love himself to me,
despise these waves.
Art thou ^o know,
that Venus birth was here?
Commands the Sea,
and all that greeues us there?
This said, his ^aire Limbs
of his weed, he stripped:
Which, at his he^d,
with both hands bound, he shipped.
Lept from the Shore,
and cast into the Sea
His lovely body:
thrusting all his way
Up to the Torch,
that still he thought did call:
He Ores, he Sterer,
he the Ship, and All*
Hero advanced
upon a Tower so hye,
As soon would lose on it,
the fixed'st eye.
And like her Goddess star,
with her Light shining:
The winds, that always
(as at her repining,
Would blast her pleasures)
with her va^le she che'kt,
And from their envies
did her Totch protect.
And this she never l^ft,
till she had brought
Leander, to the Hauenfull
shore he sought.
Then down she ran,
and up she lighted then
To her T^wr^s top,
the weariest of Men.
First, at the Gates,
(without a syllable used)
She hugged her panting husband,
all diffused
With somy drops,
still stilling from his hair:
Then brought she him
in to the inmost Fair
O^ all, her Virgin Chamber;
That, (at best)
Was with her beau^ies,
ten times better dressed.
His body then she clen^'d:
His body oiled
With Rosy Odors:
and his bosom (^oyl'd
With the unsavory Sea)
she rendered sweet.
Then, in the high-made^ed,
(even pan^ing yet)
Her self she powered
about her husband^ breast,
And th^se words vtter'd*
With too much unrest,
O Hu^band,
you have bought this litl^ peace:
Husband, No other man
has paid th'encrease
Of that huge sum of pains
you took for me.
And yet I know,
it is enough for thee
To suffer for my Love,
the fishy sau^urs
The working Sea breaths*
Come, lay all thy labors
On my all-thankfull bosom.
All this said,
He straight vngirdled her;
and Both parts paid
To Venus,
what her gentle statutes bound.
Here Weddings were*
but not a Musical sound,
Here bed-rites offered,
but no hymns gave praise:
No^ Poe^,
sacred w^dlocks worth did ^aise.
No Torches
gilt the honored Nuptial bed:
Nor any y^uths
much-mouing dances led.
No Father;
Nor no reverend Mother sung.
Hymen, O Hymen,
blessing LOVES so young.
But when the consummating
Hours had croun'd
The doun-right Nuptials,
a ca^me bed was found.
Silence, the Room fixed;
Darkness decked the Bride,
But Hymns, and such Rites,
far were laid aside.
Night, was sole Gracer
of this N^ptiall house:
Cheer^full Auror^
never (...) Spous^
In any Beds
that were ^oo broadly known,
Away he fled still,
to his Region,
And b^eath'd
insatiate of the absent Sun.
Hero kept all this
from her parents still;
Her Priestly weed was large,
and would not fill:
A Maid by Day she was,
a Wif^ by Night:
Which both so loved,
they wished it never light.
And thus (Both) hiding^
the strong Need of Love:
In Venus secret sphere,
reioyc't to move.
But soon their ^oy di'de;
and that still-tost state
Of their sto^ne Nuptials,
drew but l^^tle date.
For when the frosty winter
kept his Iusts,
Rousing together
all the horrid Gusts,
That from the euer-whirling
pits arise:
And those weak deepes,
that drive up to the skie^,
Against the drench't foundations,
making knock
Their curled forheads:
Then with many a shocke
The winds and seas met;
made the storms aloud,
Beat all the rough Sea
with a Pitchy cloud*
And then the black Bark,
buffered with gales,
Earth checkes so rudely,
that in Two it falls.
The Seaman
flying Winters faithless Sea.
Yet (brave Leander)
All this bent at thee,
Could not compel in thee
one fit of fear:
But when the cruel
faithless Messenger
(The Tower) appeared,
and showed th'accustom'd light;
It stung thee on,
secure of all ^he spite
The raging Sea spit.
But since Winter came,
Unhappy Hero,
should have cooled her flame,
And lie without Leander;
No more lighting
Her short-liu'd Bed-starre:
but strange fate exciting
As well as Love;
And both their powers combined
Entic^ng her;
In her hand, never shined
The fatal Love Torch
(but this one hour) more.
Night came: And now,
the Sea against the sho^e
Mustered her winds up:
from whose Wintry jaws
They belch't their rude
breaths out, in bitterest flawes*
In mid^st of which,
Leander, with the Pride
Of his dear hope,
to board his matchle^se Bride*
^p, on the rough back
o^ ^he high sea, leapes:
(...) then waves thrust up wau^s;
^he watery heaps
^^mbled together:
Sea and sky were mixed,
The fighting winds,
the frame of earth vnfixt.
Zephire and Eurus
flew in eithers face;
Notus and Boreas
wrastler like embrace,
And toss each other
with their bristled backs.
Inevitable
were the horrid crackes
The shak^n Sea gave:
Ruthful (...) the wrackes
Leander suffered,
in the savage gale,
Th'inexorable whirlepits
did exhale.
Often he ^ra^'d to Venus*
borne of Seas:
Neptune their King:
And Boreas, that to would please
His Godhead,
for the Nymph Aitheas sake,
Not to forget,
the like s^elth he did make
For her dear Love*
touched then, with his sad state,
But none would help him:
Love, compels not Fate.
Every way tossed with waves,
and Aires r^de breath
Iustling together,
he was crush't to death.
No more his youthful fo^ce
his feet commands,
Unmoved lay now
his late all-mouing hands.
His throat was turned
free channel to the flood,
And drink went down,
that did him far from good.
No more the ^alse Light
for the cursed wind burned:
That of Leander
euer-to-be mourned,
Blew out the Love, and soul;
when Hero still
Had watchful eyes,
and a most constant ^ill
To guide the voyage:
and the morning shined,
Yet not by her Light,
she her Love could find*
She sto^d distract
with ^i^erable woes;
And round about the Seas
broad shoulders, throws
Her eye,
to second the ex^inguisht Light*
And tried if any way
her husbands ^ight
Erring in any part,
she could descry.
When, at her Turrets foot,
she saw him lie,
Mangled with Rocks,
and all embru'd; she tore
About her bre^t,
the curious weed she wore*
And with a shrieke,
from off he^ Turrets height,
Cast her fair body headlong,
That ^ell right
On her dead husband:
Spent with him her breath,
And each won other,
in the worst of death.
Annotations upon this Poem of Musaeus.
1. (...) signifies one, qui Nuptias apparat vel instruit.

2. (...), est qui sponsam sponso adducit ^eu conciliat.

3. (...) socius in aliquo opere.

4. (...), signifies, Perdite amans; and therefore I enlarge the Verbal
Translation.

5. (...), etc.

(...), besides what is translated in the Latin; resest mutiatur, Item
mandatum a Nuntio perlatum; Item Fama, and therefore I translate it,
Fame-freighted ship, because Leander calls himself (...), which is translated
Nauis amoris, though (...) properly signifies sulcus, or Tractus nauis, vel
serpentis, vel aetherea ^^gittae. etc.

6. (...), and (...), are of one s^^n^ficarion; or have their d^duction one;
and seem to be deduc't (...), 1. haerere. Vt sit odium quod animo infixum
haeret. For odium is by Ci^ero defin'de, ira inueterata. I have therefore
translated it acording to this deduction, because it expresses better: and
taking the wind for the fate of the wind; which conceived and appointed
before, makes it as inueterate or infixt.

7. (...). Color enim membroru^ cubebat. A most excellent Hyperbole, being to
be understood, she blushed al over her. Or, then follows another elegancie, as
strange and hard to conceive. The mere verbal translation of the La^ine, being
in the sense either imperfect, or utterly inelegant, which I must yet leave to
your judgment, for your own satisfaction. The words are (...).

-- Euntis vero Etiam Rosae candidam (induta) tunicam sub talis splendebant
puellae.

To understand which; that her white weed was al vnderlin'd with Roses, and
that they shined out of it as she went, is p^ssing poor and absurd: and as
gross to have her (...) all over with Rofes. (...) therefore to make the (...)
answe^able in height and elegancy to the former, she ^eem'd (blushing all over
her White Robe, even below her Ankles, as she went) a moving Ro^e, as having
the blus^ of many Roses about her.

8. (...).

Apparuit vmbrosa Hesperus stella. Eregione is before; with I English, and East.
Th'Euen star took vantage of her shade, v^z: of the Evening shade, which is
the cause that Stars appear.

9 (...), instabiles nutus puellae. ^ English, her would, and would not. (...),
signifying, Cui men's laxatae est and enerua: and of ex^remity therein, Amens,
demens. (...), sum (...).

10 Demens sum she calls him (...), which signifies cui diffici^e fatum
obtingit: according to which I English it, infelix (being the word in the
Latin) not expressing so particularly, because the word unhappy in our
Language has diverse Understandings; as waggish or subtle, etc. And the other
well expressing an ill abodement in Hero, of his ill or hard fate: imagining
straight, the strange and sudden alteration in her, to be fatal.

11 (...), going before: it is Latin'd, Virginis ad Lectum difficile est ire.
But (...), signifies, nullis machinis expugnabilis; The way unto a Virgins
bed, is utterly barred.

12 (...).

Venerearum consuetudinum per se nuntiae sunt minoe.

Exceeding elegant. (...) signifying, qui sibi nuntius est, id est, qui sine
al^orum opera sua ipse nuntiat. According to which I have English't it. (...)*
Lusus veneri. (...) also, whi^^ signifies minae, having a reciprocal Sig. in
our tongue, being englisht Mines: Mines, as it is priuileg'd amongst us being
English, signifying Mines made under ye earth. I have past it with that word,
being fit for this place in that understanding.

13 (...), Corpus amorem parriens, and alicis, according to which I have turned
it.

14 (...).

(...), signifies, qui tenera and delicata est cute, tenerum; therefore not
enough expressing, I have enlarged the expression, as in his place.

15 (...) IS turned; Variorum verborum. (...), signifying multinagus, erroneus,
or errorum plenus, intending that sort of error that is in the Planets; of
whose wandering, they are called (...) sidera erranti. So that Hero tax't him
for so bold a liberty in words, as er'd toto coelo, from what was fit, or
becam the youth of one so graceful: which made her break into the admyring
exclamation; that one so young and gracious, should put on so experien^st and
licentious a boldness, as in that holy temple encorag'd him to make Love to
her.

16 (...), it is Translated Domo altissima; but because it is a co^pound, and
has a grace superior to the other^, in his more near and verbal conversion;
(...), signifying, Coelum sua proceritate tangens, I have so rendered it.

17 (...), translated madidus Maritus, when as (...) is taken here for (...),
signifying vnum and idem cubile habeus, which is more particular and true.

18 (...), and^. (...) signifies, La in altus aut profundus vt ab eius accessu
aberres, intending the Tower upon which Hero stood.

FINIS.
