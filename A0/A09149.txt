Pathose, or an inward passion of the pope for the loss of his daughter the
Mass.

WHat hateful hap
What careful clap
What rattellyng rap
Is light in my lap
Which wears the cap
Of myghti mayntenaunce
And greatest governance
Whose only ordinance
And prudent puysance
Brought to obeysaunce
All princely power
me to adoure
With high honor
And town and tower
To lowt and lowre
At my commandment
Yelding to mine intent
And were beniuolent
To such as I have sent
To pass in perliament
Or counsels general
Or matters special
I was the capital
And ruled over all
But yet now hear ye shall
Of maruailles late befall
And of the great displeasure
And myscheffe out of measure
Betid my greatist treasure
In whom I had most pleasure
As ye may here at leisure
My daughter and mine heir
Most beautiful and fair
That sat most cheiffe in chair
And on the supreme stayre
Alas does sore appayre
My glory and my ghost
My braggyng and my boste
Whom I have loved most
And ruled all the roste
In country and in cooste
And now, alas, is tossed
From pillar unto post
I fear me she be lost
Ah that my daughter mess
Should be in such a sickness
And brought in such weakness
That by all manner of lykenes
She loses life and quiknes
And therefore woe is me
This doleful day to se
That my darling should be
In this infirmytye
And great calamity
For poisoned is she
A less sum Edomite
Some Jew or Iacobite
Some turk or thraconite
Has given her aconite
In stead of arthanite
Wherefore I must of right
With all my main and might
A m^ssenger forth dight
That is both quike and light
To labor day and night
And seek that cursed wight
That did me this dispyte
And well he must him quite
Till he cum in the sight
Of mighty mahomyte
And tell him that his nese
The mess that prope piece
In deadly dangeris
And that he may not mysse
But send some arabies
That worthy be and wise
In phisike and in phisnomyes
But O most Ientill Jupiter
My daughter hole to make
But hark gentill Dromo
Remember that ye go
To the learned woman Areta
And to Paulus aginita
To doctores of vienna
And also to rauenna
And then to auicenna
To Rasis and to Mesue
The learned men of Arabie
And like wise to all other
That worshippeth my brother
Machomet the strong
Declare them among
All the whole matter
And let them se her water
And tidinges look thou bring
How they do like the thing
And whether by their connyng
They hope of her amending
For until thou return
I shall but moan and morn
And inwardly shall burn
With the most fervent fire
And depnes of desire
Wherefore I the require
Right quickly to retire
Oh what inward passion
Does torment on this fassion
Who would not take compassion
To hear my Lamentacion
For who can me blame
Since I take such shame
That bare the great name
They count but a game
My mess to defame
Oh so I inflame
My heart with heat
Does bolke and beat
I swell and sweat
I can not eat
My sorrows great
Do me replete
My papal seat
They will defeat
And put me by
My papasye
If my glory
My daughter dye
For if she fail
It will not avail
To weep or to wail
To rage or to Rail
I shall not prevail
In cootis of maile
To make battle
Or them to assayll
If she be once gone
Comfort get I none
But left post a lone
To mourn and make moan
With heart as cold as stone
Yet may I have some hope
Though she be slyd a slope
Some friends to feel and grope
In Affrike and Europe
How they will with me cope
Because I am the pope
They will my part take
Even for my daughters sake
I trow they will awake
These Rigors to aslake
And cause them all to quake
That did this mischefe make
And those that poison gave her
Alas I quake and quauer
And also swerve and swauer
I quiver and I waver
I stacker and I stauer
For fear I shall not have her
To live here with me still
According to my will
Her sickness does me spill
But her death should me kill
My sorows do me fill
And will encreace until
Some tidinges I may get
That Dromo fare has fete
Alack I fear me yet
The man has had some let
Or with our enimyes met
The which has him beset
Behold he comes I trow
Some news now shall I know
Which way the wind will blow
Me think he is not slow
As by his pace does show
D^omo, welcum thou art
For since thou did depart
Full heavy was my heart
And still in pain and smart
But now thou art returned
My care shall be adiourned
For mycle have I mourned
And in desire bourned
But now I think it best
That thou go take thy rest
For I have made beheste
No meat within my breast
Nor body to be dressed
Till I have seen and sought
The writing that thou brought
Full long therefore I thought
I give the thanks in deed
For thy great have and speed
Have gold here for thy meede
And I will go to reed
These letters missiue,
No longer will I drive
The time labefactiue
while mess is yet a live
And lies in pain passive
I trust she shall revive
Though some against her strive
And would her life deprive
Halasse what find I here?
Now does it plain a pere
That sure my daughter dear
Which dwelt in church and quere
And every man's chapel
With candell book and bell
No longer here may dwell
As these phisicions tell
For they give their judgment
That her nature is spent
Her reins be al to Rent
This answer have they sent
To me with one consent
Affirminge that by nature
She should be gross of stature
Wherefore she must corrupt
Since she was interrupt
From her pristine volupt
And since she brake her diete
She could never be quiet
Nor like to be none other
But gross by father and mother
So show they plain to us
To be morbus hereditarius
But this venum pes^iferus
Does make it mortiferus
And thus they sey that sure
She is without recure
O world unstable
And most variable
O man miserable
And infortunable
Which was honorable
Now I am not abel
Long to persevere
With al mine endeuer
I am lost for ever
My daughter decayed
That was my chiefest aid
My pomp is allayed
Whereon I most stayed
I am a frayede
And so sore dismayde
I know not which way
Now turn me I may
Nor what I shall say
I may not delay
Nor time protraye
But apply me lygtly
And give her aquauite
Or sum thing that is mighty
As vinum absinthite
Or vinum apitie
Or eles abrotonite
Uinum chamedryte
Or eles amorite
To comfort with her heart
That she might reuert
And turn again to sanitye
I swear by mine humanitye
I speak it not in vanity
They that her death conspired
And has it must disired
As fast as time required
With faggottes shall be fired
O where is my Gardnerus
that his good heart does bear us,
And more did and fisherus?
I fear he do not well
Because we hear not tell
How he has done his part
I know I have his heart
And also of many more
There is no small store
That yet will sing and rore
Daily my mess before
Though she be sick and sore
But sore I am adred
Sum has not well sped
Or sum of them be dead
Or eles to prison led
For were they in prosperity
I know it for a verity
Sum what they would have prouid
These things to have removed
The which they never loved
That wrought were by lutherus
With helping of Bucerus
zuingle and Bullingerus
Melancthon and Althamerus
Uitus, Theodor and musculus
And subtle Spaugelbergius
And by Urbanus regius
Alesius and Brentius
And by Otho Brum^elsius
By fagius and Pistorius
Petrus martyr and sarcerius
And by Oecolampadius
And also Carolstadius
By cursed Uadianus
And also Pomeranus
And perilous Pellicanus
Likewise by John cauinus
And spitfull Spalatinus
Coruinus and Epinus
And barkinge Bernardinus
Also by Osiander
Crucinger and Megander
And bablinge Bibliander
By Jonas and Capito
And by that h^ritike H^dio
And then by laytymers
By b^^^ie and Turners
By bail and by Tailers
And other of their faction
Beyond dinumeracion
That sprange in every nation
To put mo to this passion
^ But where is my o^hleus
John Faber and Eus^rus
My champion Hofmisterus
Where is my servant Ecchius
And well-beloved Bilicius?
Where is my maluelda
With my most trusty Naufea
My Catharinus fine
And Alfonsus my divine
Al you with Sandoletus
Behold how they entrate us
To help us interim
Each of you is a lim
Each of you is by right
My champion and my knight
For me and mine to fight
As fast as ye may wright
For my knights of England
As I may understand
Ar far behind the hand
And like to bide in band
Ye know that for certain
My daughter mess in pain
And weakness does remain
Alas she is but slain
No medicine can I get
That will amend her yet
Wherefore ye may not let
Some co^forting to fet
In England them among
That has me served long
Phisicians that there be
I have a skore and three
That still does worship me
And also my daughter
For still have they soughter
And glad when they coughter
As for communion
They set not an onion
But hold their opinion
My mess to be better
Each one is her detter
Again up to setter
I neade not them name
For men can well ame
That they be the same
The which I do mean
Though I make no deane
For they will not lean
But al one my side
And so to a bide
What so ever betide
Within the world wide
Ye these be they that are
For mess so full of care
That nothing will they spare
To make their purses bare
So they might her repare
Wherefore it is like
That they will not stike
To minister physic.
As much as may be found
Or sought above the ground
To make her hole and sound
Now hie ye fast thy there
That you and they together
May bring some thing hither
Her life for to length
And quiken her strenght
Yet am I in fear
Nothing to be there
That her stomach will bear
I think that she will wear
A way for all this gear
Behold she does tear
And rende her golden hear
Oh so my heart does prick
To se my chide so sick
For she is frenticke
Distraught and lunaticke
Woe worth that heretyke
That first began
To show any man
Her nature to scan
For before than
No creature knew
But that she was true
For when she was new
I did her endue
With clothing of Gospel
And of the Epistel
And now they be gone
She seems as one
That is but skin and bon
As lean as a rake
As flat as a cake
As stife as a stake
Her lips be pale
Her eyes wexe small
Her checkes thine
With a yealowe skine
And naught within
Her nose is sharp
And a wrye does warpe
As heavy as lead
She is near dead
Or eles in swonne
I am but undone
Thou son and thou moan
And the plannetes s^ue^
That rules in heaven
And also beneth
My daughter I bequeth
In to your holy hands
To louse her from these bands
And from the cruel death
That sone will stop her breath
And shortly devour
This beautiful flower
Except by your power
Ye send her succoure
And that spedily
Or eles she must dye
Jupiter ceranus
Send down vulcanus
And fire down cast
Al such to deuast
As causes this carke
By their woeful warcke
O Mars Mauors
With strength and force
Revenge with war
Both nere and far
This tresspasse cruel
Done to my Iuell
For well I espy
They s^t not a fly
By my great curse
They be not the wors
For mine interdiction
It is none affection
My strenght does decrease
My doctrine does cease
My daughter does perish
Nothing will cherishe
Yet has she good keeping
Boeth waking and slepinge
But I with much wepinge
With crouchinge and creping
With bassing and kissing
Will give her my blessing
O pulchra proles
Mira^da moles
Infandum doles
Hactenus que soles
Quidquid ad nutum
Habere tutum
Corpus imbutum
Mollibus indutum
Heu stat exutum
Descistunt gentes
To de^identes
Meque ab^uentes
Minime credentes
Te fore veracem
Asserunt mendacem
Garru lam loquacem
Esse et Rapacem
Te dicunt vagam
Ueneficam sagam
Heu michi quid agam
Nunc peribis filia
Olim dans vtilia
Supra mill millia
En sequaret ego
Quique reges rego
Uiuere sed nego
Tu quum defungeris
Sacro que vngeris
Oleo papali
Hoc genus sed mali
Ingrui^ infestans
Nostraque detestans
Ecce scripture
Predicantur pure
Quo perit (audito)
Lex mea quam cito,
O darlynge dear
I leave the hear
With hea uy chere
Hold here take this
A careful kiss
I will the bliss
That thou may the rather
Cum to thy grandfather
Pluto the king
Of whose offspring
You cum by dissent
With you shall be sent
A godly convent
To wait on ye then
Like a noble woman
Lent and gange days
Shall show ye the ways
With the days embringe
To keep ye remembringe
Of your Iournay
For going astraye
And pilgrimage
In your voyage
Shall Be your page
Auricular confession
And popish procession
About ye ride
On every side
The colettes by kind
Before and behind
Your footmen shall be
Full comely to se
The cannone plain
Your chamberlayne
Shall Be at your hand
When ye do command
The post communion
Shall Be your minion
To show you sport
For your comfort
Thus shall ye not trauile
Like beggar nor Iauel
But pass like a queen
Right comely besene
To Stix and Acheron
Ye shall cume a none
And when they be past
Ye shall cum at the last
To the potter Cerbrus
Which though he be barbarus
Ye shall him entreat
Quickly in to get
Then shall ye se the Emperor
Sitting stout and stoure
Him shall ye honor
Then open your coffer
And unto hi offer
Holy bread and water
And then strewe and scatter
About his ugly fete
Some of your palms sweet
Then shall ye lowly
Offer ashes holy
Beads and sacring belles
And al other Iuelles
Then shall he take you
And his heir make you
Now will I forsake you
And give you my blessing
I will not be missing
But with expedience
Show mine obedience
To the prince infernal
In derknes eternal
Who gave to me my name
And did to you the same
For both did come him fro
An to him must they go
And there with fend
To make there ends
As fellows and fre^des
Thus Pope and mess
I must confess
To be no less
Then deuelishnes
Imprinted at London by John Day and Wylliam Seres.
