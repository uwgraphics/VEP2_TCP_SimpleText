Violls and Voices: Newly Composed by FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music,
and Lutenist, and Chaunter of the Cathedral Church of CHRIST, and blessed MARY
the Virgin, in Chester.

LONDON: Printed by THOMAS SNODHAM, for M. L. and A. B. 1624.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, And worthy of much Honor, Sir PETER LEIGHE of Lyme,
KNIGHT.
Honored Sir:
TO him that shall demand of me, why I presume to send this fruit of my (now
aged Muse) to seek patronage under your worth: my answer shall be this; Ask
the little sparks why they dare fly upwards toward the glorious Sun, or the
small Riuerets and Brooks, why they with a hasty boldness strive to be
engulphed into the bosom of the vaste Ocean.

Nature her self has taught all her works to tend unto their proper place:
and the Subjects of Virtue can never offer their service, nor her Priests bring
their sacrifice, but where their sovereign Queen erects a Temple.

Sir: Your Noble disposition inuites all eyes to behold the generous respect
you bear to all the poor travelers, that labor in the tedious journey which
leads to Merit and Perfection: And if I, the meanest and vnablest of thousands
of those, (encouraged by all men's general Admiration of your noble Courtesies,
and imboldened by your particular acceptance of such former services, as my
good hap has been to perform in some of your implovments) may now procure
the Reflection of the least beam of your fair Aspect, upon this my little
Bundle of Rushes, that I carry toward the strewing of the flore of that
Amiable Temple, where that Great Goddess has her Chair, the Muses sit in the
Quier, and the Noise is nothing but Melody and Harmonious Sweetness: It will
infinitely refresh my weary steps: and (happily) yet enliue my fainting
spirits, that I may lagge on, yet one lourney more, (if not in the midst,)
yet in the Rereward of those many expert and able servants of this Sovereign
Queen, to do her and you some further service. To which I deuote the
Remainder of my poor endeauours, and my self to be

Ever your Worships at command, FRANCIS PILKINGTON.

To my approved Friend, Master FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music.
A Sonnet.
THose great Atchieuements our Heroicke Spirits
Have done in Englands old or later Victories,
Shall we attribute wholly to the Merrits,
Of our Brave Leaders? And fair Industries
Which their not-named Followers have expressed
Lie bid? And must the Matchless Excellencies
Of Bird, Bull, Dowland, Morley, and the rest
Of our rare Artists, (who now dim the lights
Of other lands) be only in Request?
Thy self; (and others) loosing your due Rights
To high Desert? nay, make it (yet) more plain,
That thou can hit the Airs of enery vain.
Their praise was their Reward, and so it is thine:
The Pleasure of thy pains all men's: and mine.
William Web.

To Master FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music.
ARt's praise, and Skill's high pitch, are not so tied
To banks of Po, or silver Thames (we see)
But Jove's fair bird may haunt fine streams beside,
And chaunt sweet lays on brinkes of Antique dee.
Old Chester is not so with Eld ore-laine,
That where contention is for praise, she then
Should not her old-borne title still maintain,
And put in, for her claim to chief of Men.
Witness more Instances hereof, then cast
Into few lines can be (some larger Quill
Shall labor that) Witness thy first and last
Rare-fram'de composures. And this witness will
Thy choice for Patron: one for glorious fame,
Chief in our Clyme, Grace to thy work, thy name.
Thine and the Muses friends of Chester, Henry Harpur.

THE SECOND SET Of Madrigals, and Pastorals, of 3. 4. 5. and 6. Parts; Apt for
Violls and Voices: Newly Composed by FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music,
and Lutenist, and Chaunter of the Cathedral Church of CHRIST, and blessed MARY
the Virgin, in Chester.

LONDON: Printed by THOMAS SNODHAM, for M. L. and A. B. 1624.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, And worthy of much Honor, Sir PETER LEIGHE of Lyme,
KNIGHT.
Honored Sir:
TO him that shall demand of me, why I presume to send this fruit of my (now
aged Muse) to seek patronage under your worth: my answer shall be this; Ask
the little sparks why they dare fly upwards toward the glorious Sun, or the
small Riuerets and Brooks, why they with a hasty boldness strive to be
engulphed into the bosom of the vaste Ocean.

Nature her self has taught all her works to tend unto their proper place:
and the Subjects of Virtue can never offer their service, nor her Priests bring
their sacrifice, but where their sovereign Queen erects a Temple.

Sir: Your Noble disposition inuites all eyes to behold the generous respect
you bear to all the poor travelers, that labor in the tedious journey which
Merit and Perfection: And if I, the meanest and vnablest of thousands of those,
(encouraged by all men's general Admiration of your noble Courtesies, and in
boldened by your particular acceptance of such former services, as my good hap
has been to perform in some of your implovments) may now procure the
Reflection of the least beam of your fair Aspect, upon this my little Bundle
of Rushes, that I carry toward the strewing of the flore of that Amiable
Temple, where that Great Goddess has her Chair, the Muses sit in the Quier,
and the Noise is nothing but Melody and Harmonious Sweetness: It will
infinitely refresh my weary fleppes: and (happily) yet enliue my fainting
spirits, that I may lagge on, yet one Journey more, (if not in the midst,)
yet in the Rereward of those many expert and able servants of this Sovereign
Queen, to do her and you some further service. To which I deuote the
Remainder of my poor endeauours, and my self to be

Ever your Worships at command, FRANCIS PILKINGTON.

To my approved Friend, Master FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music.
A Sonnet.
THose great Atchieuements our Heroicke Spirits
Have done in Englands old or later Victories,
Shall we attribute wholly to the Merrits,
Of our Brave Leaders? And fair Industries
Which their not-named Followers have expressed
Lie hid? And must the Matchless Excellencies
Of Bird, Bull, Dowland, Morley, and the rest
Of our rare Artists, (who now dim the lights
Of other lands) be only in Request?
Thy self, (and others) loosing your due Rights
To high Desert? nay, make it (yet) more plain,
That thou can hit the Airs of every vain.
Their praise was their Reward, and so it is thine:
The Pleasure of thy pains all men's: and mine.
William Web.

To Master FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music.
ARt's praise, and Skill's high pitch, are not so tied
To banks of Po, or silver Thames (we see)
But Jove's fair bird may haunt fine streams beside,
And chaunt sweet lays on brinkes of Antique dee.
Old Chester is not so with Eld ore-laine,
That where contention is for praise, she then
Should not her old-borne title still maintain,
And put in, for her claim to chief of Men.
Witness more Instances hereof, then cast
Into few lines can be (some larger Quill
Shall labor that) Witness thy first and last
Rare-fram'de composures. And this witness will
Thy choice for Patron: one for glorious fame,
Chief in our Clyme, Grace to thy work, thy name.
Thine and the Muses friends of Chester, Henry Harpur.

TO THE RIGHT Worshipful, And worthy of much Honor, Sir PETER LEIGHE of Lyme,
KNIGHT.
Honored Sir:
TO him that shall demand of me, why I presume to send this fruit of my (now
aged Muse) to seek patronage under your worth: my answer shall be this; Ask
the little sparks why they dare fly upwards toward the glorious Sun, or the
small Riuerets and Brooks, why they with a hasty boldness strive to be
engulphed into (...) bosom of the vaste Ocean.

Nature her self has taught all her works to tend unto their proper place:
and the Subjects of Virtue can never offer their service, nor her Priests bring
their sacrifice, but where their sovereign Queen erects a Temple.

Sir: Your Noble disposition inuites all eyes to behold the generous respect
you bear to all the poor travelers, that labor in the tedious journey which
leads to Merit and Perfection: And if I, the meanest and vnablest of thousands
of those, (encouraged by all men's general Admiration of your noble Courtesies,
and imboldened by your particular acceptance of such former services, as my
good hap has been to perform in some of your employments) may now procure
the Reflection of the least beam of your fair Aspect, upon this my little
Bundle of Rushes, that I carry toward the strewing of the flore of that
Amiable Temple, where that Great Goddess has her Chair, the Muses sit in the
Quier, and the Noise is nothing but Melody and Harmonious Sweetness: It will
infinitely refresh my weary steps: and (happily) yet enliue my fainting
spirits, that I may lagge on, yet one Journey more, (if not in the midst,)
yet in the Rereward of those many expert and able servants of this Sovereign
Queen, to do her and you some further service. To which I deuote the
Remainder of my poor endeauours, and my self to be

To my approved Friend, Master FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music.
A Sonnet.
THose great Atchieuements our Heroicke Spirits
Have done in Englands old or later Victories,
Shall we attribute wholly to the Merrits,
Of our Brave Leaders? And fair Industries
Which their not-named Followers have expressed
Lie hid? And must the Matchless Excellencies
Of Bird, Bull, Dowland, Morley, and the rest
Of our rare Artists, (who now dim the lights
Of other lands) be only in Request?
Thy self, (and others) loosing your due Rights
To high Desert? nay, make it (yet) more plain,
That thou can hit the Airs of every vain.
Their praise was their Reward, and so it is thine:
The Pleasure of thy pains all men's: and mine.
William Web.

To Master FRANCIS PILKINGTON, Batchelar of Music.
ARt's praise, and Skill's high pitch, are not so tied
To banks of Po, or silver Thames (we see)
But Jove's fair bird may haunt fine streams beside,
And chaunt sweet lays on brinkes of Antique dee.
Old Chester is not so with Eld ore-laine,
That where contention is for praise, she then
Should not her old-borne title still maintain,
And put in, for her claim to chief of Men.
Witness more Instances hereof, then cast
Into few lines can be (some larger Quill
Shall labor that) Witness thy first and last
Rare-fram'de composures. And this witness will
Thy choice for Patron: one for glorious fame,
Chiefein our Clyme, Grace to thy work, thy name.
Thine and the Muses friends of Chester, Henry Harpur.
