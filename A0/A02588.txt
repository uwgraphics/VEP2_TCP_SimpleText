SALOMONS Divine Arts, Of 1. ETHICKES, 2. POLITICKES, 3. OECONOMICKS:


That is; the Government of 1. BEHAVIOVR, 2. COMMONWEALTH, 3. FAMILY.


Drawn into Method, out of his Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.

With an open and plain Paraphrase, upon the SONG of SONGS.

By Joseph Hall.

AT LONDON, Printed by H. L. for Eleazar Edgar, and Samuel Macham. 1609.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND Hopeful Lord, ROBERT, Earl of Essex, my singular
good Lord, all increase of Grace and true Honor.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
WHiles I desired to congratulate your happy Return with some worthy present;
I fell upon this: which I dare not only offer, but commend; the royallest
Philosopher and wisest king, giving you those precepts, which the Spirit of God
gave him. The matter is all his; nothing is mine, but the method; which I do
willingly submit to censure. In that he could not err: In this, I cannot but
have erred; either in art, or application, or sense, or disorder, or defect:
yet not wilfully. I have meant it well, and faithfully to the Church of God,
and to your Honor, as one of her great hopes. If any man shall cavil that I
have gone about to correct Salomons order, or to control Ezekias servants: I
complain both of his charity, and wisdom; and appeal more lawefull judgment:
Let him as well say, that every Concordance peruerts the Text. I have only
endeavored to be the common-place-booke of that great king, and to refer his
divine rules to their heads, for more ease of finding, for better memory, for
readier use. See, how that God, whose wisdom thought good to bereave mankind
of Salomons profounde commentaries of Nature, has reserved these his divine
Morals, to out-liue the world; as knowing, that those would but feed man's
curiosity, these would both direct his life, and judge it. He has not done
this without expectation of our good, and glory to himself: which if we
answer, the gain is ours. I know how little need there is, either to entreat
your Lo: acceptance, or to advise your use. It is enough to have humbly
presented them to your hands; and through them to the Church: the desire of
whose good, is my good; yea, my recompense and glory. The same God, whose hand
has led and returned you in safety, from all foreign evils: guide your ways
at home, and graciously increase you in the ground of all true honor;
Goodness. My prayers shall ever follow you:

Who vow my self Your Honors, in all humble and true duty, Ios. Hall.

SALOMONS ETHICS, or MORALS, In four Books.

The 1. Of FELICITY, 2. Of PRVDENCE, 3. Of JUSTICE, 4. Of TEMPERANCE,
FORTITVDE.



Anno Domini, 1609.

SALOMONS Ethickes, or Government of Behavior and Manners. THE first BOOK.
FELICITY.
. 1. Of Ethics in common: The description, The chief end, which is Felicity.

ETHICS is a Doctrine of wisdom and knowledge to live well, Ecc. 1.17
Ecc. 7.27.
and of the madness and foolishness of vice: or Instruction to do wisely by
justice and judgment and equity, 1.1.3.
Ec. 3.12.
and to do good in our life. The end whereof is to see and attain that chief
goodness of the children of men, Ec. 2.3.
which they enjoy under the sun, the whole number of the days of their life.

. 2. Wherein Felicity is not. Not in pleasure, Not in wealth. For herein is 1.
No satisfaction 2. Increased expense, 3. Restlesnesse, 4. Want of fruition, 5.
Uncertainty. 6. Necessity of leaving it.


Ec. 2.1.
WHich co^sists not in pleasure; for I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will
prove thee with joy, therefore take thou pleasure in pleasant things; yea, Ec.
2.10.
I with-drewe not my heart from any joy: for my heart rejoiced in all my
labor: Ec. 2.25
and who could eat, and who could haste to outward things more then I? and
behold, this also is vanity. Ec. 2.1.


Not in riches. 1. Ec. 5.9.
For he that loves silver shall not be satisfide with silver, and he that
loves riches shall be without the fruit of them: this also is vanity.

2. Ec. 5.10.
When riches increase they are increased that eat them: and what good comes
to the owners thereof, but the beholding thereof with their eyes? yea, Ec. 5.11.
much evil; for whereas the sleep of him that trauelleth is sweet, whether he
eat little, or much; contrarily, The satietie of the rich will not suffer him
to sleep; Ec. 5.12.
so there is an evil sickness, which I have seen under the Sun, riches
reserved to the owners thereof, for their evil, and ofter, not for their good:
Ec. 6.1.
for there is another evil, which I have seen under the Sun, and it is
frequent among men; Ec. 6.2.
A man to whom God has given riches and treasures, and honor, and he wants
nothing for his soul, of all it desires; but God gives him not power to eat
thereof; and if he have that, yet how long? Riches remain not always, Pr.
27.24.
but takes her to her wings as an Eagle, Pr. 23.5.
and flies to the heavens. And for their owner, Ec. 5.14.
As he came forth of his mothers belly, he shall return naked, to go as he
came, and shall bear away nothing of his labor, which he caused to pass by
his hand: And this is also an evil sickness, Ec. 5.15.
that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit has he, that
he has traveled for the wind?

. 3. Not in magnificence of estate royalty, great attendance.
of works planting, gathering Treasures, building, etc.


NOt in honor and magnificence. I the Preacher have been King over Israel in
Jerusalem, Ec. 1.12.
and I was great, Ec. 1.16. Ec. 2.9.
and increased above all that were before me in Jerusalem, which also J showed
in effect; Ec. 2.4.
for I made me great works, I built me houses, I planted me vineyards, Ec. 2.5.
I made me gardens, and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruits; I
made me ponds of water, Ec. 2.6.
to water therewith the woods that grow with trees; Ec. 2.7.
I got me servants, and maids; and had children borne in the house; also I had
great possession of beeues, and sheep, above all that were before me in
Jerusalem; Ec. 2.8.
I gathered to me also silver and gold, and the chief treasures of kings and
provinces* I provided Men-singers, and Women-singers, and the delights of the
sons of men, musical conforts of all kinds: Yea, I King SOLOMON made my
self a Palace of the trees of Lebanon; Cant. 3.9
Ca^t. 3.10.
I made the Pillars thereof of silver, and the pauement thereof of gold; the
hangings thereof of purple; whose mids was paued with the love of the daughters
of Israel: Ecc. 2.11.
Then I looked on all my works that my hands had wrought, Ecc. 2.12.
(as who is the man that will compare with the King in things which men now
have done? and on the travel that I labored to do; Ec. 2.11.
and behold all is vanity, and vexation of spirit; and there is no profit
under the sun.

. 4. Long life and issue rejected, for certain end, imperfect satisfaction,
remembrance and continuance of darkness.

NOt in long life, and plentious issue: for If a man beget an hundredth
children, Ec. 6.3.
and live many years, and the days of his years be multiplied; And his soul
be not satisfide with good things, and he be not buried, I say that an
untimely fruit is better then he. For he comes into vanity, Ec. 6.4.
and goes into darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness: Also,
he has not seen the sun, Ec. 6.5.
nor known it; therefore, this has more rest then the other: And if he had
lived a thousand years twice told, and had seen no good; Ec. 6.6
shall not all go to one place? and howsoever, the light surely is a pleasant
thing, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun; Ec. 11.7.
yet tho a man live many years, and in them all he rejoice; Ec. 11.8.
if he shall remember the days of darkness, because they are many, all that
comes is Vanity.

. 5. Knowledge Tho better then folly; yet rejected, upon experience,
indifere^cy of eue^ts, imperfection.


NOt in learning, and humane knowledge. Ec. 1.13.
I have given my heart to search and find out wisdom, in all things that are
done under the heaven, (this sore travail has God given to the sons of men to
humble them thereby) yea, Ec. 1.16.
I thought in my heart and said, Behold I have amplified and increased
wisdom, above all them that have been before me, in the Court and
University of Jerusalem, Ec. 2.9.
and mine heart has seen much wisdom and knowledge: for ( when J was at the
wildest) my wisdom remained with me: Ec. 2.13
Then I saw, inindeede, that there is profit in wisdom more then in folly;
as the light is more excellent then darkness; Ec. 2.14.
For the wisemans eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness:
but yet, I know that the same condition falls to them all: Then I thought in
mine heart; Ec. 2.15.
It befalls to me as it befalls to the fool; why therefore do I labor
to be more wise? For, Ec. 6.8.
what has the Wiseman more then the fool? There shall be no remembrance of
the wise, Ec. 2.16.
nor of the fool for ever: for that that now is, in the days to come shall
be forgotten; and how dies the Wiseman? as does the fool: Besides the
imperfection of the best knowledge; Ec. 1.8.
for the eye is not satisfide with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing: I
thought I will be wise: Ec. 7.25.
but it went far from me; it is far off* what may it be? and it is a
profound deepeness, who can find it? yea, so far is it from giving
contentment, that in the multitude of wisdom is much grief, Ec. 1.18.
and he that increases knowledge, increases sorrow.

Lastly, not in any humane thing: for I have considered all the works that are
done under the sun; Ec. 1.14.
and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

. 6. Wherein Felicity is.i. In approving our selves to GOD. From hence Life,
Blessing Favor, Joy, Preservation, Prosperity, Long life, etc.


WHerein then does it consist? Ec. 12.13.
Let us hear the end of all; Fear God, and keep his Commandments; for this
is the whole of Man, the whole duty, the whole scope, the whole happiness;
Pr. 12.24. Pr. 11.19.
for Life is in the way of righteousness, and in that path there is no death;
and attending thereon, Pr. 10.6.
all Blessings are upon the head of the righteous. Would thou have favor?
Pr. 12.2
A good man gets favor of the Lord: Joy? Pr. 20.6.
The righteous shall sing and rejoice; Ec. 2 26.
and surely to a man that is good in his sight, God gives wisdom and
knowledge and joy; Pr. 13 9.
so that the light of the righteous rejoices, but the candle of the wicked
shall be put out: Preservation and deliverance? Lo, Pr. 10.25*
the righteous is as an everlasting foundation; Pr. 10.29
for the way of the Lord is strength to the upright man, Pr. 10.30.
so as the righteous shall never be removed; and if he be in trouble, Pr. 11 4.
Riches avail not in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from
death; Pr. 12.13.
so the righteous shall come out of adversity, and escape out of trouble, Pr.
11.8.
and the wicked shall come in his stead: thus every way Righteousness preserves
the upright in heart; Pr. 13.6.
Prosperity and wealth? Pr. 15.6
The house of the righteous shall have much treasure, and his Tabernacle shall
flourish. Pr. 14.11.
Long life? Pr. 10.27.
The fear of the Lord increases the days; and not only himself, Pr. 12.7.
Ec. 8.12.
but his house shall stand; And though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and
God prolong his days, yet know I that it shall be well to them that fear the
Lord, and do reverence before him; and lastly, whatsoever good? Pr. 10.2.4
God will grant the desire of the righteous, Pr. 29.18
and he that keeps the law is blessed.

. 7. In the estate of wickedness our good things are accursed Wealth, Life,
Fame, Deuotio^s; Prayers, Sacrifices

Evil inflicted; of Loss, Pain; Affliction, Death, Damnation.



COntrarily, there is perfect misery in wickedness. Look on all that might seem
good in this estate; wealth. Pr. 10.2
The tresures of the wicked profit nothing; the L. will not famish the soul of
the righteous, Pr. 10.3
but he either casts away the substance of the wicked, so that the belly of
the wicked shall want, Pr. 13.25.
or else imploieth it to the good of his: for the wicked shall be a ransom for
the just; Pr. 21.18.
Ec. 2.26.
and to the sinner God gives pain to gather, and to heap, to give to him that
is good before God. Pr. 15.6.
The wicked man may be rich: but how? The revenues of the wicked is trouble.
Pr. 10.27.
Life; The years of the wicked shall be diminished: As the whirlewinde
passes, Pr. 10.25.
so is the wicked no more; Pr. 12.7.
for God overthrows the wicked, and they are not. Whatsoever therefore their
hope be, Pr. 2.22.
the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be
rooted out; Ec. 8.13.
It shall not be well to the wicked, neither shall he prolo^g his days; he
shall be like to a shadow, because he feared not God; yea, Pr. 14.11.
the very house of the wicked shall be destroyed. Fame. Pr. 10.7
Whereas the memorial of the just shall be blessed, the name of the wicked
shall rot: yea look upon his best endeavors; His Prayers. Pr. 15.29.
The Lord is far off from the wicked, but hears the prayer of the
righteous: Pr. 28.9
far off from accepting for He that turns away his ear from hearing the
law, even his prayer shall be abominable; Pr. 15.8
His sacrifice ( tho well intended) as all the rest of his ways, Pr. 15 9.
is no better then abomination to the Lord; Pr. 21.27.
how much more when he brings it with a wicked mind? And as no good, so much
evil; whether of loss: The way of the wicked will deceive them; Pr. 12.26.
Pr. 10.28
their hope shall perish, especially when they die; their candle shall be put
out, Pr. 13.9.
their works shall prove deceitful; Pr. 11.18.
Or of pain; for the excellent that formed all things, Pr. 26.10
rewards the fool, and the Transgressour; and he has appointed, Pr. 13.21
that Affliction should follow sinners: Follow? yea overtake them; Pr. 5.22.
His own iniquity shall take the wicked himself, Pr. 10.6.
and cover his mouth; and he shall be holden with the coardes of his own
sin: Pr. 29.6.
even in the transgression of the evil man is his snare; so the wicked shall
fall in his own wickedness: Pr. 11.5
for of it own self, Iniquity overthrows the sinner: Pr. 13.6.
But besides that, Pr. 3.33
the curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: tho hand join in hand,
Pr. ^
he shall not be unpunished: behold, Pr. 11.31.
the Righteous shall be paid upon earth, how much more the wicked and the
sinner? Pr. 10.24.
That then which the wicked man fears shall come upon him; both, Death; Pr.
5.23.
He shall die for default of instruction, and that by his own hands: for, Pr.
11.19.
by following evil he seeks his own death; and after that damnation; Pr.
14.32.
The wicked shall be cast away for his malice: Hell and destruction are
before the LORD; Pr. 15.11.
Pr. 12.2.
and a man of wicked imaginations will he condemn; so both in life, in
death, after it, Pr. 10.29.
nothing but Terror shall be for the workers of iniquity: where contrarily,
Pr. 19.29.
The fear of the Lord leads to life, and he that is filled therewith shall
contontinue, and shall not be visited with evil.

SALOMONS ETHICKES. THE second BOOK. PRVDENCE.
. 1. Of Virtue in common: Wherein it consists. Whereby it is ruled, and
directed.

Virtue consistes in the mean; vice in extremes. Pr. 4.26.
Let thy ways be ordered aright; Pr. 4.27
Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left, but remove thy foot from evil;
The rule whereof is Gods Law: Pr. 6.23.
for the commandment is a lantern, and instruction a light; and every word of
God is pure. Pr. 30.5.
My son, Pr. 4.20.
hearken to my words; incline thine ear to my sayings; Let them not depart
from thine eyes; Pr. 4.21.
but keep them in the midst of thine heart. Pr. 4.22.
For, they are life unto those that find them, and health unto all their
flesh. Pr. 7.2.
Keep my commandments and thou shall live, and mine Instruction as the apple
of thine eye: Bind them upon thy fingers, Pr. 7.3.
and write them upon the Table of thine heart.

All Virtue is either Prudence, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude.


1. Of Prudence: which comprehends Wisdom, Providence, Discretion.


. 2. Of wisdom; the Description, Effects. It procures Knowledge: safety from
sin, from judgment.
good direction for actions, for words.

Wealth, Honor, Life.


THe prudent man is he, whose eyes are in his head to see all ihings, and to
foresee; Ec. 2.14.
and whose heart is at his right hand to do all dextrouslie, and with
judgment. Ec. 10.2.
Pr. 8.12
Wisdom dwelles with Prudence and finds forth knowledge, and counsels. And
to describe it: Pr. 14.8.
The wisdom of the Prudent is to understand his way; his own; Pr. 9.12.
If thou be wise, thou shall be wise for thy self: An excellent virtue. Pr.
3.13.
for Blessed is the man that finds wisdom, and gets understanding: Pr.
3.14.
The merchandise thereof is better then the merchandise of silver, Pr. 16.16
and the gain thereof is better then gold: Pr. 3.15.
It is more precious then pearls, and all the things that thou can desire
are not to be compared to her. Pr. 3.16.
Length of days are in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and glory:
Pr. 3.17.
Her ways are ways of pleasure, and all her paths prosperity: She is a
tree of life to them that lay hold on her, Pr. 3.18.
and blessed is he that receives her. The fruits of it are singular: for,
first, A wise heart does not only seek, but get knowledge, Pr. 15.14.
without which the mind is not good; Pr. 18.15.
and the ear of the wise, learning; Pr. 19.2
and not get it only but lay it up, Pr. 10.14. Pr. 13.16.
and not so only but works by it; and yet more, is crowned with it. Pr. 14.18.
Besides knowledge, here is safety. Pr. 2.10.
When wisdom enters into thy heart, and knowledge delights thy soul, then
shall counsel preserve thee, Pr. 2.11.
and understanding shall keep thee: Pr. 2.12.
and deliver thee from the evil way, and from the man that speaks froward
things, Pr. 2.13.
and from them that leave the ways of righteousness, to walk in the ways of
darkness: and as from sin, so from judgment. Pr. 15.24.
The way of life is on hy to the Prudent, to avoid from hell beneath. Thirdly,
good direction. Pr. 8.20.
1. For actions; Wisdom causes to walk in the way of righteousness, and in
the mids of the paths of judgment: 2. For words, Pr. 16.23.
The heart of the wise guides his mouth wisely, and adds doctrine to his
lips; So that the words of the mouth of a wise man have grace: Pr. 10.12.
yea, he receives grace from others. Either Instruct, or reprove the Prudent,
Pr. 19.25
and he will understand knowledge. Not to speak of wealth; Pr. 8.21.
she causes them that love her to inherit substance, and fills their
treasures: she gives not only honor: for the wisdom of a man does make his
face to shine, Ecc. 8.11. Pr. 3.35
and the wiseman shall inherit glory; but life: Pr. 16.22
Understanding is a wel-spring of life to him that has it; and he that finds
me (says wisdom) finds life, Pr. 8.34
and shall obtain favor of the Lord. Wherefore Get wisdom; Pr. 4.5.
get understanding; forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Forsake her not, Pr. 4.6.
and she shall keep thee; love her, and she shall preserve thee. Wisdom is the
beginning; Pr. 4.7.
get wisdom therefore, and above all possessions get understanding: Pr. 4.8.
Exalt her and she shall exalt thee: She shall bring thee unto honor, if
thou embrace her: Pr. 4.9.
she shall give a goodly ornament to thine head; yea, she shall give thee a
crown of glory:

. 3. Of Providence What she is, What her objects, What her effects,

Ec. 8.5.
Providence is that whereby the heart of the wise fore-knoweth the time, and
judgment; the time when it will be; the judgment how it will be done: Ec.
8.6.
both which are appointed to every purpose under heaven: Not that man can
foresee all future things: No, he knows not that, Ec. 8.7.
that shall be; For who can tell him when it shall be? not so much as concerning
himself. Ec. 9.12.
Neither does man know his time, but as the fishes are taken with an evil
net, and as the birds which are caught in the snare; so are the children of
men snared in the evil time, when it falls on them suddenly; yea, Pr. 20.24
the steps of a man are ruled by the Lord; how should a man the^ understand his
own way? but, sometimes he may: The prudent man sees the plague afar off,
Pr 22.3
and flees; and as for good things, Pr. 30.25.
With the Pismire he provides his meat in summer; working still according to
foreknowledge; yet not too strictly, and fearfully; Ecc 11.4
for he that observes the wind shall not sow, and he that regards the
clouds shall not reap.

. 4. Of Discretion: what it is, what it works for our acts for our speeches.


Pr. 16.20.
DJscretion is that whereby a man is wise in his businesses, and whereby the
heart of the wise guides his mouth wisely, Pr. 16.23.
and adds doctrine to his lips. For actions: Pr. 14.15.
The Prudent will consider his steps, and make choice of times: for, Ec. 3.1.
To all things there is an appointed time; and a time for every purpose under
heaven; a time to plant, Ec. 3.2.
and a time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to slay, Ec. 3.3.3.4. Ec.
3.8.
and a time to heal, etc. A time of war and a time of peace: From hence it
is that the wise man is strong, Pr. 24.5.
and rich; for by knowledge shall the Chambers be filled with precious things
which he knows how to employ well: Pr. 14.24
The crown of the wise is their riches; from hence, that his good understanding
makes him acceptable to others. For speeches, Pr. 13.15
Pr. 15.2.
The tongue of the wise uses knowledge aright, Pr. 10.13.
and in the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found; Pr. 10.12.
and his words have grace, both1 for the seasonablenes, Pr. 25.11.
A word spoken in his place is like apples of Gold with pictures of silver, Pr.
15.23.
and how good is a word in due season! 2 for the worth of them, Pr. 20.15.
The lips of knowledge are a precios jewel; lastly, Pr. 14.3.
for their use: the lips of the wise shall preserv them, and their tongue is
health, Pr. 12.18
and with health pleasure; Pr. 16.24.
Fair words are as an hony-combe; sweetness to the soul; and health to the
bones.

. 5. The extremes Ouer-wise, Foolish Who he is: what kinds there be of
Fools; the mere fool: the rash fool: the wicked fool.
What success.


HEre are two extremes: On the right hand; Ec. 7.18.
Make not thy self ouer-wise, wherefore should thou be desolate? on the left:
Neither be foolish; Ec. 7.19.
why should thou perish, Pr. 21.16
not in thy time? The fool is that man that wandreth out of the way of wisdom,
which has none heart, Pr. 17.16
that is, is destitute of understanding, Pr. 15.2.
either to conceive, or to do as he ought: Of which sort is, 1. The mere
fool; That fool who when he goes by the way, his heart fails; Pr. 14.24.
whose folly is foolishness, in whose hand there is a price in vain to get
wisdom, Pr. 17.16.
which is too high for him to atain: Pr. 24.7.
lastly, In whom are not the lips of knowledge. 2. The rash fool, Pr. 14.7.
that is hasty in his matters, Pr. 29.20.
Pr. 29.11.
that povvreth out all his mind at once; which the wise man keeps in, till
afterward; Pr. 19.2.
that hastes with his feet and therefore sins. Pr. 29.20
There is more hope of the other fool then of him. 3. The wicked fool: Pr.
1.7.
That despises wisdom and instruction, Pr. 14.9.
that makes a mock of sin; Pr. 13.19
to whom it is an abomination to depart from evil; to whom foolishness is
joy, Pr. 15.21.
yea, Pr. 10.23.
it is his pastime to do wickedly, Pr. 13 16.
and his practice to spread abroad folly: And this man is obstinate in his
courses; Pr. 27.22.
for tho thou bray a fool in a mortar among wheat, brayd with a pestell, yet
will not his foolishnes depart from him: Pr. 26.11.
and tho it seem to depart, yet as a dog turns again to his vomit, so returns
he to his foolishnes. Spare thy labor therefore, speak not in the ears of a
fool, Pr. 23.9.
for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. Pr. 1.22.
To these says wisdom, O ye foolish, how long will ye love foolishnes, and
the scornful take pleasure in scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you
at my correction. Pr. 1.23.
Lo, I will power out my mind unto you; and make you understand my words. Pr.
1.24
Because I have called and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and none
would regard; But ye have despised all my counsel, Pr. 1.25.
and would none of my correction; Pr. 1.26.
I will also laugh at your destruction, and mock when your fear comes; Pr.
1.27.
like sudden desolation, and your destruction shall come like a whirlwinde;
when affliction, and anguish shall come upon you. Pr. 1.28.
Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer: they shall seek me
early, but they shall not find me; Pr. 1.29.
Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord; they
would none of my counsel, Pr. 1.30.
but despised all my correction; Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of
their own way, Pr. 1.31.
and be filled with their own devises: and what is that fruit but sorrow?
Even in laughing their heart is sorrowful; Pr. 14.13.
and the end of that mirth is heaviness: and like the noise of thorns under a
pot, Ec. 7.8.
so ( short and vain) is the laughter of fools: Pr. 10.13.
what but stripes? A rod shall be for the back of him that is destitute of
understanding: yea, it is proper to him. To the horse belongs a whip, Pr.
26.3.
to the ass a bridle, and a rod to the fools back: wherewith not only
himself shall be beaten, Pr. 10.8.10.
but the companion of fools shall be afflicted: Pr. 13 20.
Lastly, what but death? Fools shall die for want of wit, Pr. 10.21.
and remain in the congregation of the dead; Pr. 21.16.
Pr. 10.14
yea the mouth of the fool is present destruction; Pr.
and The lips of a fool shall devour himself, and that which should seem
to preserve him, Pr. 1.32
Very ease slays the foolish, and the prosperity of fools destroys them.

SALOMONS ETHICKES. THE third BOOK. JUSTICE.
Justice gives to each his own; To God, Piety: which co^prehends Fear,
Honor and respect, Honor and Obedience are indeed mixed duties of Justice
both to God and man: but because as they belong to man, they are politic
virtues and there handled; here we consider the only as due to God.
Obedience.
To God and man Fidelity, Truth in words, in dealings.
Love.
To man only others Mercy, Liberality.
our selves; Diligence in our vocations.



. 1. 1. Of Justice in general. 2. Of the fear of God what it is what fruits
it has present future



NExt to Prudence, is Justice. Pr. 15.21.
A man of understanding walks uprightly: Pr. 20.7
The just man, therefore, is he that walks in his integrity; Pr. 16.17
and whose path is to decline from evil; and briefly, he that deals truly,
Pr. 12.22
in giving each his own.

Whether to God; unto whom Justice challenges Piety: which comprehends, Ec.
8.13.
first, the fear of the Lord; and this fear of the Lord is to hate evil, as
pride, arrogancy, and the evil way; and in all our ways to acknowledge God;
Pr. 3.6.
that he may direct our ways; so that, Pr. 14.2
he that walks in his righteousness, fears the Lord; but he that is lewd in
his ways despises him: which grace, as it is the beginning of knowledge, Pr.
1.7.
and the very instruction of wisdom, Pr. 15.33
so in some respect knowledge is the beginning of it; for If thou call after
knowledge, Pr. 2.3.
and cryest for understanding; Pr. 2.4.
If thou seek her as silver, and searchest for her as treasures; then shall
thou understand the fear of the Lord, Pr. 2.5.
and find the knowledge of God; And this fear gives both contentment; Better
is a little with the fear of the Lord, Pr. 15.16.
then great treasure, and trouble therewith; and 2. Pr. 23.18.
future hope. Fear the Lord continually: for surely there is an end, and thy
hope shall not be cut off. In which regard, This fear of the Lord is an
assured strength to depend upon; Pr. 14.26
because his children shall have hope yea and present health and joy. Fear the
Lord, Pr. 3.7.
and depart from evil; so health shall be to thy navel, Pr. 3.8.
and marrowe to thy bones: and with health, life eternal; The fear of the
Lord leads to life, Pr. 19.23
yea is a welspring thereof, Pr. 14.27.
and he that is filled therewith, shall continue, and shall not be visited with
evil; so that Blessed is the man that fears always: Pr. 28.14
whereas on the contrary, He that hardneth his heart, and denies God, Pr. 30.9.
and says who is the Lord, shall fall into evil. Pr. 28.14.


. 2. Honor in the best things, in the best times.
Obedience in attending on his will, in performing it.


2. HOnor and respect; both from the best things: Pr. 3.9.
Honor the Lord, with thy riches, and the first fruits of all thy increase; Pr.
3.10.
so shall thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall burst with
new wine: and in our best times; Ec. 12.1.
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth; while the evil days
come not, nor the years approach; wherein thou shall say, I have no pleasure
in them.

Pr. 1.33.
Thirdly, Obedience. He that obeys me, shall dwell safely ( says wisdom)
and be quiet from fear of evil: whether in attendance to the will of God; Pr.
4.20.
My son hearken to my words, incline thine ear unto my sayings; Pr. 4.21.
Let them not depart from thine eyes, but keep them in the midst of thine
heart: Pr. 10.17.
for, He that regards instruction is in the way of life: Pr. 28.9.
whereas he that turns away his ear from it, his very prayer shall be
abominable; or in executing of it. Pr. 28.7.
He that keeps the commandment is a child of understanding; Pr.
yea he is blessed, and thereby keeps his own soul; where they that forsake
the law praise the wicked: Pr. 28.4.
and he that despises his ways shall die. Pr. 19.16


. 3. Fidelity in performances To God, To man.
in faithful eproofe.

OR whether to GOD and man. 1. FIDELITY: both, first in performing that we
have undertaken: If thou have vowed a vow to God, Ec. 5.3.
defer not to pay it; for he delights not in fools; pay therefore that
thou have vowed; Ec. 5.4.
It is better that thou should not vow; then that thou should vow, and not
pay it: Suffer not thy mouth to make thy flesh to sin; Ec. 5.5.
Neither say before the Angel that this is ignorance: Wherefore shall God be
angry by thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? For, Pr. 20.25
It is destruction to a man, to devour that which is sanctified; and after the
vows to inquire. Neither this to God only, but to man; Pr. 12.22.
They that deal truly are his delight; Pr. 28.10.
and the upright shall inherit good things: yea, Pr. 28.20.
The faithful man shall abound in blessings; whereas the perfidious man as he
wrongs others (for Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble, Pr.
25.19.
is like a broken tooth, and a sliding foot) so be gains not in the end,
himself; Pr. 17.13
He that rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.

Pr. 27.5.
2. Jn a faithful reproof: Open rebuke is better the^ secret love: The wounds
of a lover are faithful, Pr. 27.6
and the kisses of an enemy are pleasant, but false: Pr.
so that he that reprooueth shall find more thank at the last: Pr. 15.12.
and how ever the scorner take it, yet he that reprooueth the wise, Pr. 25.12
and obedient ear is as a gold eare-ring, and an ornament of fine gold.

. 4. truth in words The quality, The fruit to himself to others
The opposites 1. Lies, Slander.
2. Dissimulation, Flattery.



He that speaks truth will show Righteousness. Pr. 12.17.
Wherein? Pr. 14.25.
A faithful Witness delivers souls: but a deceiuer speaks lies; A
virtue of no small importance: Pr. 18.21.
for, Death and Life are in the hand of the tongue; and as a man loves, he
shall eat the fruit thereof, to good, or evil; to himself, others:
Himself; Pr. 15.4.
A wholesome tongue is as a Tree of life, Pr. 12.19
and the lip of Truth shall be stable for ever: Pr. 10.20.
others, The tongue of the just man is as fined silver, and the lips of the
Righteous do feed many: Pr. 10.21
therefore Buy the truth, Pr. 23.23.
and sell it not; as those do, which either 1. lie, 2. slander, 3. dissemble,
or 4. flatter.

. 5. The Liar His fashions, His manifestation, His punishment.

A Faithful witness will not lie, Pr. 14.5.
but a false record will speak lies. Of those six, Pr. 6.16.
yea seven things that God hates, Pr. 6.17
two are, A lying tongue, and a false witness that speaks lies; Pr. 6.19.
Pr. 19.28.
for such a one mocketh at judgment, and his mouth swallows up iniquity; yea,
Pr. 26.28^
a false tongue hates the afflicted. He is soon perceived; Pr. 12.19
for a lying tongue varieth incontinently: and when he is found, Pr. 19.5
A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall not
escape; Pr. 12.22.
for the lying lips are abomination to the LORD, therefore a false witness
shall perish: Pr. 21.28.
Pr. 25.18.
and who pitties him? Such a one is an hammer, a sword, a sharp arrow to his
neighbor; Pr. 24.28.
he deceives with his lips and says, 29.
I will do to him as he has done to me. Pr. 30.7.
Two things then have I required of thee, deny me them not until I die etc.
Pr. 30.8.
Remove far from me vanity, and lies. Pr. 19.22.
Let me be a poor man rather then a liar.

. 6. The slaunderer what his exercise in misreports, in unseasonable meddling.
what his entertaynment.

Pr. 16.27.
THis wicked man diggeth up evil, and in his lips is like burning fire; Pr.
16.30.
He shuts his eyes to devise wickedness: he moves his lips, and brings
evil to pass: and either he inuenteth ill rumors; Pr. 13.5.
A righteous man hates lying words: but the wicked causes slander and shame;
Pr. 20.3.
or else in true reports he will be foolishly meddling, and goes about
discovering secrets; Pr. 11.13.
( where he that is of a faithful heart concealeth matters) and by this means
raises discord. Pr. 26.20.
Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer strife cease;
Pr. 18.8.
for the words of a talebearer are as flatterings, and go down into the
bowels of the belly: therefore as on the one side, Ec. 7.23.
thou may not give thine heart to all that men speak of thee; least thou
hear thy servant cursing thee; so on the other, no countenance must be given
to such: Pr. 25.23.
for As the North Wind drives away rain; so does an angry countenance the
slaundering tongue.

. 7. The dissembler of four kinds malicious, vaineglorious, covetous,
impenitent.
The flatterer his success to himself, to his friend.
his remedy.


Pr. 10.18
THe slaunderer and dissembler go together: He that dissembleth hatred with
lying lips, and he that inuenteth slander, is a fool; There is then a
malicious dissembler: Pr. 26.24.
He that hates will counterfeit with his lips, and in his heart he lays
up deceit; Pr. 26.25
such one, Tho he speak favorably, believe him not; for there are seven
abominations in his heart. Hatred may be covered with deceit; Pr. 26.26.
but the malice thereof shall ( at last) be discovered in the congregation.
There is a vainglorious dissembler, that makes himself rich and is poor;
Pr. 13.7.
and 3. a covetous: Pr. 13 7.
There is that makes himself poor having great riches; and this both in
bargains: It is naught, It is naught, Pr. 20.24
says the bu^er; but when he is gone apart; he boasts; and 2. Jn his
entertaynement; Pr. 23.6.
The man that has an evil eye, Pr. 23.7
as though he thought in his heart, so will he say to thee, Eat and drink,
but his heart is not with thee: Lastly, an impenitent; Pr. 28.13
He that hides his sins shall not prosper: but he that confesses and
forsakes them shall have mercy. Pr. 27.14.
The flatterer prayseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the
morning; but with what success? To himself; It shall be counted to him for a
curse: To his friend; A man that flattereth his neighbor, Pr. 29.5.
spreads a not for his steps; he spreads and catches: For a Flattering
mouth causes ruin. Pr. 26.28.
Pr. 20.19.
The only remedy then is; Meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips;
Ec. 7.7.
for It is better to hear the rebuke of wise men, then the song of fools.

. 8. Truth in dealings: wherein is the true-dealers Practices To do right,
with joy.
Reward Gods love, good memorial.


THe uprightness of the just shall guide them, Pr. 11.3. Pr. 11.5.
and direct their way; Pr. 15.19.
which is ever plain and straight; whereas the way of others is perverted,
and strange. Pr. 21.8.
Yea, Pr. 21.3.
as to do justice and judgment is more acceptable (to the Lord) then
sacrifice; Pr. 21.15.
so it is a joy to the just himself, Pr. 10.16
to do judgment: all his labor therefore tends to life; Pr. 29.7.
he knovveth the cause of the poor, Pr. 29.10
and will have care of his soul: Pr. 21.8.
His work is right, Pr. 3.29.
neither intends he any evil against his neighbor; seeing he dwells by
him without fear; and what loses he by this? As the true balance, Pr. 16.11.
and weight are of the Lord, and all the weights of the bag are his work: So
God loves him that follows righteousness: Pr. 15.9.
Pr. 12.26
and with men; The righteous is more excellent then his neighbor: Pr. 28.6.
and Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, then he that
peruerteth his ways, though he be rich. Pr. 10.7.
Yea finally; The memorial of the just shall be blessed.

. 9. Deceit The kinds Colored, Direct Private, Public.

The judgment attending it.

COntrary to this is Deceit: whether in a color; Pr. 26.18.
As he that faineth himself mad, casts firebrands, arrows, and mortal
things; so deals the deceitful man, and says, Am I not in sport? Pr. 26.19.
Pr. 12.20.
As this deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: so in their hands
are Diverse weights, Pr. 20.10.
and diverse balances: or directly, Pr. 29.24.
He that is partner with a thief, hates his own soul, and dangerous are
the ways of him that is greedy of gain; Pr. 1.19.
much more publicly, I have seen the place of judgment, Ec. 3.16.
where was wickedness; and the place of justice where was iniquity: Ec. 3.17.
I thought in mine heart God will judge the just and the wicked, Pr. 12.27.
yea oft-times speedily; so as The deceitful man roasteth not what he took in
hunting: or if he eat it; Pr. 20.17.
The bread of deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth shall be filled
with gravel.

. 9. Love To God, rewarded with his love, with his blessings.
To men In passing by offenses, In doing good to our enemies.


Pr. 8.17.
Love to God: I love them that love me: and they that seek me early shall
find me* and with me, blessings: Pr. 8.21.
I cause them that love me to inherit substance, and I will fill their
treasures. 2. To men, 1. Jn passing by offenses; Pr. 10.12
Hatred stirs up contentions, but love covers all Trespasses, and the
shame that arises from them: Pr. 12.16.
so that he only that covers a transgression seeks love. 2. Pr. 17.9.
Jn doing good to our enemies, If he that hates thee be hungry give him
bread to eat; Pr. 25.21.
and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink. Here therefore do offend,
1. the contentious. 2. the envious.

. 10. The contentious whether in raising ill rumors, or whether by pressing
matters too far.

Pr. 6.19.
THE first is he that raises contentions among brethren: which once raised
are not so soon appeased. Pr. 18.19.
A brother offended is harder to win the^ a strong city: and their contentions
are like the bar of a palace. Pr. 16.29.
This is that violent man that deceives his neighbor, and leads him into
the way that is not good, the way of discord: whether by ill rumors; Pr. 18.6.
The fools lips come with strife; and as the coal makes burning coals, Pr.
26.21.
and wood a fire, so the contentious man is apt to kindle strife; and that even
among great ones, Pr. 16.28.
A froward person sows strife, and a talebearer makes division among
Princes; or by pressing matters too far: When one churneth milk, Pr. 30.33
he brings forth butter; and he that wringeth his nose, causes blood to come
out: so he that forces wrath, brings forth strife, the end whereof is never
good: Pr. 29.9.
for it a wise man contend with a foolish man, whether he be angry or laugh,
there is no rest.

. 11. Envy The kinds At our neighbor, At the wicked.
The effects To others, It self.


THE second is that injustice whereby the soul of the wicked wishes evil, Pr.
21.10.
and his neighbor has no favor in his eyes; that moves him to be glad when
his enemy falls, Pr. 24.17.
and his heart to rejoice when he stumbleth; and this is a violent evil. 1.
To it self; Pr. 14.30.
A sound heart is the life of the flesh; but envy is the rotting of the bones.
Pr. 27.4.
2. To others; Anger is cruel, and wrath is raging: but who can stand before
envy? But of all other it is most unjust, when it is set upon an evil
subject. Fret not thy self because of the malicious, Pr. 24.20.
neither be envious at the wicked, Pr. 3.31.
nor choose any of his ways; neither let thine heart be envious against
sinners, Pr. 23.17.
Pr. 24.1.
nor desire to be with them; Pr. 24.2.
for, as their heart imagines destruction, and their lips speak mischief,
Pr. 3.32
so the froward is an abomination to the Lord; Pr. 24.20.
and there shall be none end of the plagues of the evil man; and his light
shall be put out.

. 12. Justice To man only: First to others 1. in Mercy The quality, The gain
of it.



LEt not mercy and truth forsake thee: Pr. 3.3.
bind them on thy neck, and write them upon the table of thine heart; Pr.
21.13.
this suffers not to stop thine ear at the cry of the poor: yea, Pr. 12.10.
the righteous man regards the life of his beast; Pr. 16.6.
no virtue is more gainful: for By mercy and truth iniquity shall be
forgiven; Pr. 3.4.
and By this thou shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God
and man: Pr. 14.31.
Good reason; For he honoreth God that has mercy on the poor: yea he makes
God his debtor; Pr. 19.17.
He that has meron the poor lends to the Lord, and the Lord will recompense
him: Pr. 11.17.
So that The merciful man rewards his own soul; Pr. 21.21.
for He that follows righteousness and mercy, shall find righteousness,
and life, and glory; Pr. 14.21
and therefore is blessed for ever.

. 13. Against mercy offend 1. Unmercifulness, 2. Oppression,
Blood-thirstinesse.

1 THat ( not only) the rich rules the poor, Pr. 22.7.
but that the poor is hated of his own neighbor; Pr. 14.20.
whereas the friends of the rich are many: Of his neighbor? Pr. 19.7.
Yea All the brethren of the poor hate him: how much more will his friends
depart from him? though he be instant with words, yet they will not.

2. There is a generation, Pr. 30.14.
whose teeth are as swords, and their jaws as knives, to eat up the
afflicted out of the earth. Pr. 22.16.
These are they that oppress the poor to increase themselves, and give to the
rich; that rob the poor, Pr. 22.22.
because he is poor, and oppress the afflicted in judgment; that take away
the garment in the cold season, Pr. 25.20.
and therefore are like vinegar powered upon nitre, or like him that sings
songs to an heavy heart; That trouble their own flesh, Pr. 11.17.
and therefore are cruel; An ordinary sin. Ec. 4.1.
I turned and considered all the oppressions that are wrought under the Sun;
and behold the tears of the oppressed, and none comfort them; and the
strength is of the hand of those that oppress them, and none comfort them.
None? Yes surely, above. Ec. 5.7.
If in a country thou see the oppression of the poor, and the defrauding of
judgment, and justice, be not astonished at the matter; for he that is hyer
then the highest regards, and there be hyer then they, which will defend the
cause of the poor, Pr. 22.23.
to cause the oppressor to come to poverty: Pr. 22.16.
Pr. 21.13.
in which estate he shall cry and not be heard.

3. The bloody man is he which not only does hate him that is upright, Pr.
29.10.
but lays wait against the house of the righteous, Pr. 24.15.
and spoyleth his resting place; yea that does violence against the blood of a
person, Pr. 28.17.
Such as will say, Pr. 1.11.
Come with us, we will lay wait for blood, and lie privily for the innocent
without a cause. We will swallow them up alive like a Grave, Pr. 1.12.
even whole; as those that go down into the pit; Pr. 1.15.
But, my son, walk not thou in the way with them: refrain thy foot from
their path: For their feet run to evil, Pr. 1.16.
and make haste to bloodshed. Pr. 1.17.
Certainly as without cause the net is spread before the eyes of all that has
wings: Pr. 1.18.
So they lay wait for blood, and lie privily for their lives; Pr. 12 10.
Thus the mercies of the wicked are cruel: But shall they prevail in this?
Pr. 26.2.
The causeless curse shall not come: Pr. 24.16.
The just man may fall seven times in a day, but he rises up again, whiles
the wicked shall fall into mischief; Yea into the same they had devised: Pr.
26.27.
He that diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that rolleth a stone, it
shall fall upon him, and crush him to death: Pr. 28.17
for He that does violence against the blood of a person, shall flee unto the
Grave, and they shall not stay him.

. 14. The second kind of Justice to others, is Liberality Described, Limited,
Rewarded, with his own, with more.


LIberality or benefice^ce, Ec. ^1.^.
is to cast thy bread upon the waters; to give a portion to seven, and also to
eight; Ec. 11.2.
Pr. 22.9.
in a word, to give of his bread to the poor, and not to withhold his goods
from the owners thereof (1. Pr. 3.27.
the needy) tho there be power in his hand to do it, Pr. 3.28.
and not to say to his neighbor, Go and come again, to morrow I will give
thee, if he now have it; Not that God would not have us enjoy the comforts he
gives us, our selves; Ec. 5.18.
for, to every man to whom God has given riches and treasures, and gives him
power to eat thereof, and to take his part, and to enjoy his labors, this is
the gift of God; but if the clouds be full, Ec. 11.3.
they will power out rain upon the earth, and yet they shall be never the
emptier. The liberal person shall have plenty, Pr. 11.25.
and he that waters, shall also have rain: yea not only he that gives to
the poor, shall not lack, Pr. 28.27.
but shall find it after many days; Ec. 11.1.
whereas he that hides his eyes, shall have many curses: but, Pr. 11.24.
There is that scatters and is more increased; Pr. 22.9.
thus He that has a good eye is blessed of God.

. 15. The extremes whereof are Covetousness The descripon of it, The curse.
Prodigality.

THe covetous is he, Pr. 1.19.
that is greedy of gain, Pr. 23.6.
that having an evil eye, and coveting still greedily, Pr. 21.26. Pr. 23.4.
trauelleth too much to be rich; Pr. 11.24.
and therefore both spares more then is right, Pr. 28.8.
and increases his goods by usury and interest; Ec. 4.8.
There is one alone, and there is not a second, which has neither son, nor
brother; yet is there none end of his travel, neither can his eyes be
satisfied with riches, neither does he think for whom do I travail and
defraud my soul of pleasures. This man is insatiable, like to The
horse-leeches two daughters, Pr. 30.15.
which cry still, Give, Give: Pr. 27.20.
especially in his desires; The Grave and destruction can never be full; so
the eyes of a man can never be satisfied: All the labor of man is for his
mouth, Ec. 6.7
and yet the soul is not filled: yea this is the curse that God has set upon
him; Ec. 5.9
He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver: and he that loves
riches shall be without the fruit thereof; Pr. 18.11 Pr. 11.28
and whereas the rich man's riches are his strong City, he that trusts in
riches shall fall, Pr. 11.24
and by his sparing comes surely to poverty. All this while he sets his
eyes on that which is nothing, Pr. 23.5
Pr. 28.8
and does but gather for him, that will be merciful to the poor: wherefore,
Better is a little with right, Pr. 16.8
then great revenues without equity. Give me not poverty, Pr. 30.8
nor riches: feed me with food convenient for me, least I be full and deny
thee, Pr. 30.9
and say, who is the Lord: or least I be poor and steal, and take the name
of God in vain.

. 16. Prodigality in Too much expense: whereof The quality, The end.
Carelessness of his estate.

THE prodigal is the man that boasts of false liberality, Pr. 12.9
that loves pastime, Pr. 21.17
and wine and oil, Pr. 28.7
that feeds gluttons, and follows the idle; Pr. 28.19 Pr. 6.12
The unthrifty man and the wicked man walks with a froward mouth; Lewd
things are in his heart, Pr. 6.14.
he imagines evil at all times; Therefore ( also) shall his destruction come
speedily, Pr. 6.15
and he shall be destroyed suddenly without recovery; and in the mean
time, Pr. 13.11
The riches of vanity shall diminish; so that he shall be a man of want; Pr.
21.17 Pr. 28.19
yea filled with poverty, Pr. 28.7
and a shame to his Father; Of this kind also is he that is otherwise
careless of his estate: Be not thou of them that touch the hand, Pr. 22.26
nor among them that are surety for debts: If thou have nothing to pay; Pr.
22.27. See more of this rule in the two last page of Politics, following.
why causest thou that he should take thy bed from under thee.

. 17. Diligence what it is, how profitable in Health, wealth and abundance
Honor.


Justice to a man's self, is Diligence; Pr. 16.26.
for he that trauelleth, trauelleth for himself: The diligent is he, Ec. 9.10
who all that his hand shall find to do, does it with all his power. Ec. 3.10
I have seen ( indeed) the travel, that God has given the sons of men, to
humble them thereby, Ec. 1.8
that all things are full of labor, man cannot utter it; Ec. 3.9.
But what profit has he that works, of the thing wherein he trauelleth? Much
every way: Ec. 5.11.
first, Health: The sleep of him that trauelleth is sweet, whether he eat
little or much; Pr. 20.13
Secondly, wealth: Open thine eyes, and thou shall be satisfied with bread:
yea, Pr. 10.4
The hand of the diligent makes rich, Pr. 13.4
and his soul shall be fat: and not sufficiency only; Pr. 14.23
but in all labor there is abundance, but the talk of the lips brings
want: yet more, Pr. 12.27
the riches that the diligent man has, are precious. 3. Honor. Pr. 22.29
A diligent man shall stand before kings, Pr. 12.24
and not before the base sort; and The hand of the diligent shall bear rule,
but the idle shall be under tribute.

. 18. Slouthfulness The properties, The danger of it.

Ec. 4.5
THe slothful, is he that foldeth his hands, and eats up his own flesh;
Pr. 19.24
That hides his hand in his bosom, and will not pull it out again to his
mouth; Pr. 26.24
that turns on his bed, as a door turns on his hinges, and says, Pr. 6.10
Yet a little steep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
sleep. Every thing that he ought to do is troublesome, Pr. 15.19
The way of the slothful man is an hedge of thorns ( which he is loath to
set foot in): There is a lion without ( says he) I shall be slain in the
street: Pr. 22.13 Pr. 26.13.
who although herein he be wiser in his own conceit, Pr. 26.16
then seven men that can render a reason: Pr. 12.11.
Yet ( the truth is) he that ( so much as) follows the idle, is destitute of
understanding. Pr. 13.4
He lusts (indeed) and affects great things, but his soul has naught;
so, Pr. 21.25
The very desire of the slothful slays him, for his hands refuse to work.
Pr. 18.9
And not only he that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a
great vvaster; Pr. 10.5
but he that sleeps ( and Slothfulness causes to fall asleep) in harvest,
Pr. 19.15.
is the son of confusion: and He that will not plovve, Pr. 20.4
because of winter; shall beg in Summer, and have nothing: Pr. 20.13
Love not sleep therefore, least thou come to poverty; for, what is it, that
hence comes not to ruin? For, the house: Ec. 10.18
By slouthfulness the roof of the house goes to decay, and by idleness of the
hands, the house droppeth thorough For the land; Pr. 24.30
I passed by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man
destitute of understanding; Pr. 24.31
And lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face
of it; and the stone wall thereof was broken down. Pr. 24.32
Then I beheld and considered it well; I looked upon it, and received
instruction; Pr. 10.4
so in every respect the slothful hand makes poor. Pr. 6.6
Go to the Pismire therefore thou sluggard, and behold her ways, and be wise:
For, she having no guide, Governor, nor Ruler, Pr. 6.7
prepares her meat in summer, Pr. 6.8
and gathers her food in harvest; Pr. 6.9
How long will thou sleep O sluggard? when will thou arise out of thy sleep?
Yet a little sleep, yet a little slumber, Pr. 24.33
yet a little folding of the hands to sleep: Pr. 6.11
Therefore thy poverty comes as a speedy Traveler, and thy necessity as an
armed man.

SALOMONS ETHICKES. THE fourth BOOK. Temperance and Fortitude.
Temperance is the moderation of our desires: whether in Diet; Sobriety. in
words and actions Modesty, and Humility.
in affections, continency, refraining of anger.



. 1. Temperance in diet, excess: how dangerous to Body, Soul, Estate.


THE temperate in diet, Pr. 25.28
is he that refrayneth his appetite, Pr. 23.31
that looks not on the wine when it is red, that puts his knife to his throat,
Pr. 23.2
when he sits with a Ruler; Pr. 23.1.
that when he finds honey, Pr. 25.16
eats but that which is sufficient for him; least he should be ouer-full: It
is true, that a man eats, and drinks, Ec. 3.13.
and sees the commodity of all his labor; this is the gift of God: yea,
this I have seen good, Ec. 5.17
that it is comely to eat and to drink, and to take pleasure in all his
labor wherein he trauelleth under the Sun, the whole number of the days
of his life which GOD gives him; for this is his portion; Ec. 9.7
God allows us to eat our bread with joy; and drink our wine with a
cheerful heart, Ec. 3.22
and there is nothing better then this, Ec. 2.24.
yea there is no profit but this: Pr. 23.2
But not that a man should be given to his appetite; Ec. 2.3.
that he should seek in his heart to draw his flesh to wine; Ec. 2.10
or that whatsoever his eyes desire he should not withholde it from them:
Such a man when he is full, Pr. 27.7
despises an honeycomb; whereas to the hungry, every bitter thing is sweet;
and in his excess is outrageous: One of the three things, Pr. 30.21
yea four, for which the earth is moved, and cannot sustain it self, Pr. 30.22
is a fool when he is filled with meat. Neither does this prosper, with
himself. For his body; The satietie of the rich, Ec. 5.11
will not suffer him to sleep: To whom is woe? Pr. 23.29
to whom is sorrow? to whom is murmuring? to whom are wounds without cause?
and to who^ is the redness of the eyes? Pr. 23.30*
Even to them that tarry long at the wine; to them that go and seek mixed
wine: For his soul; Pr. 23.31.
Look not on the wine when it is red, and shows his color in the cup, or
goes down pleasauntly. Pr. 23.32.
In the end thereof, it will bite like a serpent, and hurt like a cockatrice:
Pr. 23.33.
Thine eyes shall look upon the strange woman, and thy lips shall speak
lewd things: And thou shall be as one that sleeps in the midst of the sea,
Pr* 23.34.
and as he that sleeps in the top of the mast: They have stricken me (shall
thou say) but I was not sick: Pr. 23.35
they have beaten me, but I knew not when I awooke; therefore will I seek
it yet still: For his estate, Pr. 25.28
He is like a City which is broken down, and without walls: Pr. 23.20
Keep not company therefore with drunkards, nor with gluttons; for the
glutton and drunkard shall be poor, and the sleeper shall be clothed with
rags; and in all these, Wine is a mocker, Pr. 20.1
and strong drink is raging, and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

. 2. Modesty In words what it requires: that they be few, seasonable. what it
profits argues wisdom, gives safety.

In actions.
Contrary to it, Loquacitie, Ill speech, Immoderate mirth.


Pr. 17.27
THe modest (for words) is a man of a precious spirit, that refraineth his
lips, Pr. 10.19
and spares his words. Pr. 17.27. Pr. 18.4.
The words of a modest man are like deep waters, and the welspring of wisdom
like a flowing river: but when he does speak, it is to purpose; for, Pr. 10.31.
The mouth of the just shall be fruitful in wisdom: Pr. 10.21.
and the lips of the righteous do feed many, yea himself; pr. 12.14 Pr. 13.2
A man shall be satiate with good things by the fruit of his mouth; Pr. 18.20.
and with the fruit of a man's mouth his belly shall be satisfied: but still be
speaks sparingly; Pr. 12.23.
A wise man concealeth knowledge, Pr. 11.12.
and a man of understanding will keep silence: Pr. 10.19 Pr. 17.28
which as it argues him wise (for even a fool when he holds his peace is
counted wise; and he that stops his lips, as prudent); so it gives him
much safety. Pr. 21.23.
He that keeps his mouth, and his tongue, keeps his foul from affliction;
yea, he keeps his life; Pr. 13.3.
where contrarily, The mouth of the fool is in the multitude of words, Ec.
5.2. Pr. 15.2.
it babbleth out foolishness; Pr. 15.14.
as it is fed with it: Pr. 18.2.
neither has he any delight in understanding, but that which his heart
discovers; Pr. 12.23.
and while he bewrays it, The heart of fools publishes his foolishness:
And as he multiplieth words, Ec. 10.14.
so in many words there cannot want iniquity: Pr. 10.19.
his mouth (still) babbleth evil things; Pr. 11.28.
Pr. 15.32.
for either he speaks froward things, Pr. 12.6.
or how to lie in wait for blood, or in the mouth of the foolish is the rod of
pride; Pr. 14.3.
And what is the issue of it? He that opens his mouth, Pr. 13.3.
destruction shall be to him. Pr. 17.20.
And he that has a naughty tongue shall fall into evil; Pr. 10.31.
for, both it shall be cut out, Pr. 15.4.
and the frowardness of it is the breaking of the heart. Lastly, Pr. 18.7.
A fools mouth is his own destruction, and his lips are a snare for his soul.

For Actions: Pr. 11.16.
The modest shall have honor: And tho we need not say, Of laughter, Ec. 2.2.
thou art mad, and of joy, what is this thou do; Ec. 7.5.
yet Anger is better then laughter, for by a sad look the heart is made
better. Ec. 7.6.
The heart of the wise, therefore, is in the house of mourning, but the heart
of fools is in the house of mirth. Rejoice then, Ec. 11.9.
O young man, in thy youth, and let thine heart cheer thee in the days of thy
youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes;
but know, that for all these things God will bring thee to judgment.

. 3. Humility, Pride -- ouerweening Wherein it is, How absurd, How dangerous.
scornefulnesse.


NExt to the modest, is the humble in spirit; Pr. 29.23.
He says, Surely, Pr. 30.2.
I am more foolish then aman, and have not the understanding of a man in me;
Pr. 30.3.
for I have not learned wisdom, and have not attained to the knowledge of
holy things: But does he want it ere the more? Pr. 11.2.
No: With the lowly is wisdom, Pr. 13.31.
and The ear that hearkeneth to the corrections of life, shall lodge among the
wise: Pr. 16.19.
Better it is, therefore, to be of an humble mind with the lowely, then to
divide the spoils with the proud: for before honor goes humility; Pr. 15.33
Pr. 18.12
and he that confesses and forsakes his sins, Pr. 28.13.
shall have mercy; yea, Pr. 29.23.
the humble of spirit shall enjoy glory: Pr. 22.24.
and the reward of humility, and the fear of God, is riches, and glory and
life.

Contrary whereto; Pr. 30.13.
There is a generation, whose eyes are hautie, and their eye lids are lift up;
Pr. 30.12.
There is a generation that are pure in their own conceit, and yet are not
washed from their filthiness. Yea, All the ways of a man are clean in his
own eyes: Pr. 16.2. Pr. 21.2.
but the Lord pondereth: the spirits; and not sonnely, but Many men will boast
of their goodness; Pr. 20.6.
but It is not good to eat much honey, Pr. 25.27.
so to search their own glory is not glory; Let another man praise thee, Pr.
27.2.
and not thine own mouth; a stranger and not thy own lips: This ouer-weening
is commonly incident to great men. The rich man is wise in his own conceit,
Pr. 28.11.
but the poor that has understanding can try him: Hence it is, that he
affects singularity; Pr. 18.1.
According to his desire, he that separates himself, will seek, and occupy
himself in all wisdom: Pr. 16.12.
but See thou a man thus wise in his own conceit, there is more hope of a
fool then of him: yea, he is a fool in this: In the mouth of the foolish, Pr.
14.3.
is the rod of pride; Ec. 7.25.
I thought, I will be wise, but it went far from me; it is far off, what
may it be? Ec. 7.26.
and that, a wicked fool; Pr. 21.4.
A hautie look, and a proud heart which is the light of the wicked is sin: If
therefore thou have been foolish in lifting up thy self, Pr. 30.32.
and if thou have thought wickedly, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, for God hates
an hauty eye; Pr. 6.17.
yea he so hates it, Pr. 16.5.
that all that are proud in heart, are an abomination to the Lord: and tho hand
join in hand, they shall not be unpunished; and what punishment shall be bane?
Pr. 15.25*
The Lord will destroy the house of the proud man; and his very pride is an
argument of his ruin: Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty: Pr.
18.22
Pride goes before destruction, Pr. 16.18.
and an hie mind before the fall: Before it? Pr. 11.2.
yea with it: When pride comes, then comes shame. Now the height of pride
is scornefulnesse. He that is proud and haughty, Pr. 21.24.
scornful is his name, who works in the pride of his wrath: Pr. 11.12.
and this man despises his neighbor, and therefore is destitute of
understanding: when the wicked comes* Pr. 18.3
then comes contempt; and with the vile man is reproach, but* of all, him
that reproues him: Pr. 9.7.
He that reproves a scorner, purchases to himself shame, and he that
rebukes the wicked, gets himself a blo^; Pr. 19.2^.
therefore Judgments are prepared for the scorners, and stripes for the back
of fools; so, as others are hurt by his sin; Pr. 29.8.
for a scornful man brings a whole city into a snare: so they shall be
likewise bettered by his judgment; when the scorner is punished, Pr. 21.11.
the foolish is wise.

.4. Continency of Lust, of Anger,
with their co^traries.
OF the first kind, Pr. 5.15.
is he that drinks the waters of his own cisterne; Pr. 6.25.
that desires not the beauty of a stranger in his heart; neither lets her take
him with her eyelids: contrarily, Pr. 5.20.
the incontinent is he that delights in a strange woman, and embraces the
bosom of a stranger; or she that forsakes the guide of her youth, Pr. 2.17.
and forgets the covenant of God; she lies in wait for a pray, Pr. 23.28.
and she increases the trangressers amongst men. Pr. 23.27.
For a whore is as a deep ditch, and a strange woman as a narrow pit: Yea, Ec.
7.28.
I find more bitter then death the woman whose heart is as nets and snares,
See more of this vice, Oecon. sect. 2. and 3.
and whose hands as bands: he that is good before God shall be delivered from
her, but the sinner shall be taken by her.

Pr. 16 32.
Of the second, is he that is slow to anger, Pr. 14.29.
slow to wrath; whose discretion differreth his anger, Pr. 19.11.
and whose glory is to pass by an offense: Pr. 14.29.
which moderation, as it argues him to be of great wisdom ( for wise men
turn away wrath) so it makes him better then the mighty man, Pr. 29.8.
Pr. 16.23.
and procures him just honor; Pr. 20.3.
for It is the honor of a man to cease from strife: contrary to which, is he
that is of an hasty spirit to be angry; which as it proves him foolish: Ec.
7.11.
(for anger rests in the bosom of fools, Ec. 7.11.
Pr. 14.17
and he that is hasty to anger, not only commits folly, Pr. 14.29.
but exalts it) So it makes him dangerous: Anger is cruel, Pr. 27.4.
and wrath is raging; Pr. 29.22.
and a furious man abounds in trangressions: Pr. 22.24.
wherefore make no friendship with an angry man, Pr. 22.25.
least thou learn his ways, and receive destruction to thy soul.

. 5. Fortitude In general, The specials of it; Confidence, Patience in Gods
afflictions, in men's injuries.



Pr. 18.14.
FOrtitude is that, whereby The spirit of a man susteines his infirmities;
which makes the righteous bold as a lion: Pr. 28.1.
contrarily the weak of strength is he that is faint in the day of adversity;
Pr. 24.10.
whose fear brings a snare upon him; Pr. 29.25.
and that, desperate: A wounded spirit who can bear? Pr. 18.14.
which is often caused through guiltiness: Pr. 28.1.
The wicked flees, when none pursues him. Confidence is, Pr. 3.5.
to trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and not to lean to thine own
wisdom; Pr. 3.6.
but in all thy ways to acknowledge him, Pr. 16.3.
and to commit thy works to the Lord, Pr. 14.32.
and to have hope in thy death: and tho in other things, The hope that is
deferred is the fainting of the heart; Pr. 13.12.
yet in this, he that trusts in the Lord shall be fat; for, Pr. 28.25.
from hence, Pr. 16.3. Pr. 3.6.
not only his thoughts and ways are directed, but he receives safety, and
protection; Pr. 30.5.
He is a shield to those that trust in him. The horse is prepared for the day
of battle, Pr. 21.31.
but salvation is of the Lord. Yea, The name of the Lord is a strong tower: Pr.
18.12
the righteous runs to it, and is exalted. So that, Pr. 16.20.
He that trusts in the Lord, he is blessed; whereas He that trusts in his
own heart, Pr. 28.26.
is a fool: and it is a vain thing, Pr. 27.1.
to boast thy self of to morrow; for thou know not what a day will bring
forth.

Pr. 3.11.
Patience is, not to refuse the chastening of the Lord, neither to be grieved
with his correction: Ec. 7.16.
The patient man, in the day of wealth, is of good comfort, and in the day of
affliction considers, God also has made this contrary to that, that man
should find nothing after him whereof to complain: knowing that the Lord
corrects whom he loves; Pr. 3.12.
Pr. 10.28
and that the patient abiding of the righteous shall be gladness: Contrarily,
The heart of the fool, fretteth against the Lord; he is careless and rages:
Pr. 19.3.
but to what purpose? Ec. 6.10.
Man cannot strive with him that is stronger then he: Yea rather, Pr. 29.1.
the man that hardens his neck when he is rebuked, shall suddenly be
destroyed, and cannot be cured: in respect of men's injuries, Pr. 20.22.
He says not, I will recompense evil; but waits upon the Lord, and he shall
save him. In which regard, the patient in spirit that suffers, is better then
the proud of spirit, Ec. 7.10.
that requites.

COVRTIER, SVBIECT.


Anno Domini, 1609.

SALOMONS POLITICKES, or Commonwealth:
And, first, HIS KING.
. 1. Degrees must be and are subordinate, highest not many, but one.

and those from God.

IN all well ordered gouerments there are degrees, An hyer then the highest, Ec.
5.7
and yet an hyer then they: and these, of Gods appointment; not only in the
inferior ranks, The rich and poor meet, Pr. 22.2
and the Lord is the Maker of them all: Pr. 8.15
but in the supreme: By me Kings reign (says Wisdom) and Princes decree
Justice: and not they only, Pr. 8.16
but the Nobles and all the Judges of the earth; so, it is a just wonder, that
The grasshoppers have no King; Pr. 30.27
yet they go forth by bands. And as no King is a judgment; so, many: for
Because of the Transgression of the land, Pr. 28.2
there are many Princes, many, not only in frequent succession, but in society
of regiment.

. 2. In a King are described Quality of his person Natural, Moral.
Actions.

A King must be hie; as in place, so in blood: Ec. 10.17
Blessed art thou O Land, when thy King is the son of Nobles; not of any
servile condition; for, nothing can be more uncomely, Pr. 19.10
then for a servant to have rule over Princes: and it is a monster in State, to
see servants ride on horses, Ec. 10.17
and Princes ( of blood) to walk as servants on the ground; neither more
monstrous, then intolerable. Pr. 30.21
There are three things for which the earth is moved, yea four which it
cannot sustein: Pr. 30.22
whereof one is, A servant when he reigns.

. 3. Moral qualities Negative; what one he may not be: Not lascivious, Not
riotous, Not hollow and dissembling, Not childish, Not imprudent, Not
oppressing.
Affirmative.

ANd as his blood is heroical, so his disposition; not lascivious. Pr. 31.23
What, O son of my desires, give not thy strength to women, Ec. 2.10.
nor thy ways: But why should he withhold from his eyes whatsoever they can
desire, and withdraw his heart from any joy? Ec. 2.8
why may he not have all the delights of the sons of men: as women take
captive; as Queens and Concubines, Cant 6 7. Pr. 31.3
and Damsels without number? This is to destroy Kings; He shall find more
bitter then death the woman whose heart is as nets and snares. Ec. 7.28
Not riotously excessive; whether in wine: Pr. 31.4
for It is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes strong drink: What,
not at all? To him alone is it not said, Ec. 9.7.
Go eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful heart? who
should eat or drink, Ec. 2.25.
or have to outward things more then he? Not immoderately: Pr. 31.5
so as he should drink and forget the decree, and change the judgment of all
the Children of affliction: Ec. 10.16.
Or in meat; for, Woe be to thee o Land, when thy Princes eat in the morning:
Pr. 23.2
and if he be not the master of his appetite, Pr 23.3
his dainty meats will prove deceivable. Not hollow, not double in
speeches, Pr. 17.7
in profession: The lip of excellency becomes not a fool; much less, lying
talk a Prince: Not childish; Woe to thee, O Land, Ec. 10.16.
whose King is a child: not so much in age, which has sometimes proved
succesfull; but in condition: Not imprudent, not oppressing; Pr. 28.16
two vices conioined: A Prince destitute of understanding is also a great
oppressor; And to conclude, in all or any of these, not wilfully inflexible: A
poor and wise child is better then an old and foolish king, Ec. 4.13
that will no more be admonished.

. 4 Affirmative; what one he must be: To others Just, Merciful, slow to anger,
Bountiful.
In himself Temperate, Wise, Valiant, Secret.


COntrarily, he must be Temperate. Blessed art thou, Ec. 10.17
O Land, when thy Princes eat in time, for strength and not for drunkenness:
Just and righteous; Pr. 11.1
for false balances ( especially in the hand of government) are an abominatio^
to the Lord: but a perfect weight pleases him; A virtue beneficial, Pr. 16.12
both 1 to himself (for the throne is established by Justice) and 2 to the
State. Pr. 14.34
Justice exalts a Nation; then which, nothing does more bind and cheer the
hearts of the people: Pr. 29.2.
for, When the righteous are in authority the people rejoice, but when the
wicked bears rule the people sigh: and with truth and justice, must mercy be
joined inseparably; Pr. 20.18
for Mercy and truth preserve the King: and his Throne shall be established,
also, by mercy. And all these must have wisdom to menage them: By it, Princes
rule, Pr. 8.16.
and are terrible to the ill-deseruing. Pr. 20.26
A wise King scatters the wicked, and causes the wheel to turn over them.
To all these must be added bounty; Pr. 28.16
A Prince that hates couetousness shall prolong his days; where co^trarily,
Pr. 29.4.
A man of gifts destroieth his country: and yet further, a conquest of his own
passions; a princely victory: Pr. 16.32
for He that is slow to anger, is better then the mighty man; and he that
rules his own mind better then he that vvinneth a City; because of all
other, Pr. 19.12
The kings wrath is like the roaring of a lion: and what is that but the
messenger of death? and if it may be, a conquest of all others, through valor.
Pr. 30 29
There are three things that order well their going, yea four are comely in
going: Pr. 30.31
whereof the last and principal is, A King against whom no man dares rise up:
Lastly, secrecy in determinations. Pr. 25.3
The heaven in height, and earth in deepnesse, and the kings heart can no man (
no man should) search out: neither should it be in any hands, but the Lords;
Pr. 21.1.
who as he knows it, so he turns it whither soever it pleases him.

. 5. His actions common, special to his place: To judge righteously 1.
according to the truth of the cause. 2. according to ye distress of the
party, impartially.
remit mercifully.


HIs actions must suit his disposition; which must be universally holy: Pr.
16.12
for, It is an abomination to Kings ( of all other) to commit wickedness.
Which holiness alone is the way to all peace: When the ways of a man please
the L. Pr. 16.7.
he will make his enemies at peace with him: Peculiarly to his place; he must
first judge his people: Pr. 20.8
a king that sits in the throne of judgment, chaseth away all evil with
his eyes; and by this, Pr. 29.4
he maintains his country: and while he does sit there, Pr. 16.10
A divine sentence must be in the lips of the king, and his mouth may not
transgress in judgment. for, Pr. 29 14.
A king that judges the poor in truth, his throne shall be established for
ever: Neither may his ear be partially open: which disposition shall be sure to
be fed with reports; for, Of a Prince that harkeneth to lies, Pr. 29 12.
al his servants are wicked: nor his mouth shut; especially in cases of
distress: Pr. 39.8
Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all the children of destruction:
open thy mouth, 31.9.
judge righteously, and judge the afflicted and the poor: yet, not with so
much regard to the estate of persons, as the truth of the cause; Pr. 17.26
for Surely it is not good to condemn the just in what-euer condition; nor
that Princes should smite such for equity: wherein he shall wisely search into
all difficulties. Pr. 25.1
The glory of God is to pass by infirmities, but the kings honor is to search
out a thing; yet so, as he is not seldom merciful in execution, Delivering
them that are drawn to death, Pr. 24.11.
and preserving them that are drawn to be slain: These observed, Ec. 8.9
it cannot be, that man should rule over man to his hurt.

SALOMONS COVNSAILOR.
Sect. 6. Counsel For the soul How given: The necessity of it, The quality
wise, righteus pleasant.

How received.
For the State.

AS where no sovereignty, so where no counsel is, Pr. 11.14
the people fall; and contrarily, where many Counselors are, Pr. 24.6
there is health; and more then health, Stedfastnes: Counsel for the soul, Pr.
15.22
Where no vision is, Pr. 29.18
the people perish: which requires both holiness and wisdom: The fruit of
the righteous is as a tree of life, Pr. 11.30
and he that vvinneth souls is is wise; Ec. 12.9
and the more wise the Preacher ( is) the more he teaches the people
knowledge, and causes them to hear, and searches forth, and prepares many
parables: and not only an upright writing ( and speaking) even the word of
truth; Ec. 12.10
but pleasant words also; Pr. 16.21
so that the sweetness of the lips increases doctrine; and not more
delightful, then effectual: for, Ec. 12.11
The words of the wise are like goades, and nails fastened by the masters of
the assemblies, that are given by one Pastor: which again, of every hearer,
challenge due reverence and regard; who must take heed to his foot, Ec. 4.17
when he enters into the house of God, and be more near to hear, the^ to
give the sacrifice of fools: for, He that despises the word, Pr. 13.13.
shall be destroyed: but he that fears the commandment, shall be rewarded.

. 7. In a Counselor of State, or Magistrate, is required Wisdom, Discussing
of causes, Providence, and working according to knowledge.
Piety, Justice, and freed from Partiality, Bribes, Oppression*


WIthout Counsel, Pr. 15.22.
all our thoughts ( even of policy and state) come to naught: but in the
multitude of Counselors is stedfastnes: and no less in their goodness; Pr.
24.5.
(...) their wisdom, which alone giv's strength to the owner, above ten mighty
princ. that are in the city; Ec. 7.2.
a virtue, Pr. 14.33.
which tho it rests in the heart of him that has understanding, yet is
known in the mids of fools. Pr. 17.24.
For wisdom is in the face of him that has understanding, and in his lips:
for, howsoever he that has knowledge spares his words, Pr.
yet the tongue of the wise uses knowledge aright; Pr. 15.2.
Pr. 24.7.
and the fool cannot open his mouth in the gate; and therefore is unfit for
authority. Pr. 26.1.
As snow in summer, and rain in harvest; so is honor unseemly for a fool.
And tho it be given him; Pr. 26.8.
how ill it agrees? As the closing up of a precious stone in an heap of
stones, so is he that gives glory to a fool. From hence, the good Iusticer
both carefully hears a cause, knowing, Pr.
that He which answers a matter before he hear it, it is a folly and shame
to him; and that related on both parts* for He that is first in his own cause
is just: Pr. 18.17.
then comes his neighbor and makes inquiry of him; and deeply sifteth it:
else he loses the truth; Pr. 20.5.
for The counsel of the heart of a man is like deep waters: but a man that
has understanding will draw it out. From hence, is his providence for the
common good; not only in seeing the plague, and hiding himself, Pr. 22.3.
but in delivering the city: Ec. 9.15.
and as he foreseeth, Pr. 13.16
so he works by knowledge: and not in peace only; as, Ec. 9.17.
The words of the wise are more heard in quietness, then the cry of him that
rules among fools; Pr. 21.22.
but in war: A wise man goes up into the city of the mighty, and casts
down the strength of the confidence thereof. Ec. 9.16.
For, wisdom is better then strength, Ec. 9.18.
yea then weapons of war* Ec. 9.13.
I have seen this wisdom under the sun, and it is great unto me; Ec. 9.14.
A little city and few men in it, and a great king came against it, and
compassed it about, and builded forts against it; Ec. 9.15.
and there was found, in it, a poor and wise man, and he delivered the city by
his wisdom: neither can there be true wisdom in any Counselor, without
piety. The wise man fears, Pr. 14.16.
and departs from evil; being well assured, that there is no wisdom, Pr.
21.30.
nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord; and that, Pr. 12.3.
Man cannot be established by wickedness: and indeed bow often does God so dispose
of estats that the evil shall bow before the good, Pr.
and the wicked at the gates of the righteus? neither is this more just with
God, the^ acceptable with men* for, Pr. 28.12
when the righteous rejoice, there is great glory, Pr. 29.2.
and when they are in authority the people rejoice* co^trarily, when the wicked
comes on, and rises up, Pr. 28.^^.
and bears rule, the man is tried; Pr. 28.28.
the good hide themselves, and all the people sigh: Pr. 29.2.
Pr. 25.26*
and the righteous man falling down before the wicked, is like a troubled Well,
and a corrupt spring.

Neither is justice less essential, then either; Pr.
for to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord, then
sacrifice: To know faces, Pr. 28.21 Pr. 24.23
therefore (in a judge) is not good; for that man will transgress for a piece
of bread; much less to accept the person of the wicked, Pr. 18.5.
to cause the righteous to fall in judgment: He that says to the wicked thou
art righteous, Pr. 24.24.
him shall the people curse, and the multitude shall abhor him: Yea yet byer;
He that justifies the wicked, Pr. 17.15.
and conde^neth the just* both are an abomination to the Lord. Wherefore, Pr.
17.27.
howsoever. The wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom, to wrest the ways
of judgment; and commonly, Pr. 18.16.
A man's gift inlargeth him, and leads him (with approbation) before greatmen:
yet he knows, Ec. 7.9.
that the reward destroys the heart; Pr. 21.7.
that the acceptance of it is but the robbery of the wicked; which shall
destroy them, because they have refused to execute judgment: he hates gifts,
then, Pr. 15.27.
that he may live, Pr. 21.15.
and it is a joy to him to do judgment: He does impartially smite the
scorner, Pr. 19.25.
yea severely punish him, Pr. 21.11.
that the wickedly foolish may beware and become wise. And whereas Every way of
a man is right in his own eyes, Pr. 21.2.
Pr. 14.5.
and a false record will speak lies, and use deceit; Pr. 12.17. Pr. 18.17. Pr.
19.5.
he so makes inquiry, that a false witness shall not be unpunished: Pr. 19.9.
and he that speaks lies shall perish: Lastly, his hand is free from
oppression of of his inferiors: Pr.
which as it makes a wiseman mad; so the actor of it, miserable: Pr. 14.31.
for He that oppresses the poor, reproves him that made him; Pr. 22.22.
and if the afflicted be oppressed in judgment, the Lord will defend their
cause, and spoil the soul* that spoyleth them; and upon all occasions, (...)
so determines, Pr. 24.26.
that they shall kiss the lips of him that answers upright words.

SALOMONS COVRTIER
. 8. Must be Discreet, Religious, Humble, Charitable, Diligent, Faithful.

IN the light of the Kings countenance is life, Pr. ^6.15.
and his favor is as the cloud of the latter reign, Pr. 19.12.
or as the deaw upon the grass: which that the Courtier may purchase; he must
be 1. Discreet: Pr. 14.35.
The pleasure of a king is in a wise servant, but his wrath shall be toward
him that is lewd; 2. Religious, both in heart, Pr. 22.11.
He that loves pureness of heart for the grace of the lips the king shall be
his friend: and in his actions, He that seeks good things gets favor;
Pr. 11.27.
in both which, the righteous is more excellent then his neighbor: Pr. 12.26.
and besides these, Pr. 22.4.
humble; The reward whereof is glory: Pr. 15.33.
for, before glory goes humility. He dare not therefore boast himself before
the king, Pr. 25.6.
Pr. 25.7.
and thrust himself ouer-forward in the presence of the Prince, whom his eyes
do see: whom if he see moved, Pr. 25.15.
he pacifieth by staying of anger, and by a soft answer breaks a man of bone;
not aggraunting the faults of others: Pr. 17.9.
He that covers a transgression seeks love; but he that repeateth a matter
separateth the Prince. To these, he is diligent, Ec. 8.2.
taking heed to the mouth of the King; and therefore worthily stands before
kings, and not before the base sort: and withal, Pr. 22.29
true and faithful; when he undertakes another suite he lingers not: knowing,
Pr. 13.12.
that The hope that is differred is the fainting of the heart; Pr. 17.8.
and tho A bribe or reward is as a stone pleasant in the eyes of them that have
it, and prospers whither soever it turns, ( for, every man is a friend to
him that gives gifts): Pr. 19.6.
yet he accounts the gathering of treasures by a deceitful tongue, Pr. 21.6.
to be vanity, tossed too and fro, of them that seek death.

SALOMONS SVBIECT.
. 9. His Duery to His Prince; Reverence, Obedience.
Fellow Subjects.

EVery government presupposes Subjects. Pr. 14.28.
In the multitude of the people is the honor of the King; and for the want of
people, comes the destruction of the Prince: Of whom God requires, in respect
of the Prince, Reverence, Obedience; That they should reverence, Pr. 19.6. Pr.
29.26.
and seek the face of the Prince; not cursing the King, Ec. 10.20.
so much as in their thought, nor the rich in their bedcha^ber; but fearing the
Lord, Pr. 24.21.
and the King, and not meddling with the seditious, Pr. 17.11.
which only seek evil. For, Ec. 10.20
as the foul of the heaven shall carry the voice, and the master of the wing
declare the matter: Pr. 17.11.
so (for revenge) a cruel messenger shall be sent against them; their
destruction shall arise suddenly, Pr. 24.22
and who knows their ruin? For their due homage therefore and obedience to
laws, they take heed to the mouth of the King, Ec. 8.2.
and the word of the oath of God; and if a law be enacted, they violate it
not, nor strive for innovation. Ec. 10.8.
He that breaks the hedge, a serpent shall bite him. Ec. 10.9.
He that remoueth stones, shall hurt himself thereby: Ec. 10.9.
and he that cutteth wood shall be in danger thereby. And if they have
offended, Ec. 8.3.
they haste not to go forth of the princes sight, nor stand in an evil thing:
for he will do what-euer pleases him; Ec. 10.4.
but rather if the spirit of him that rules rise up against them, by
gentleness pacify great sins.

. 10. To his fellow Subject, In respect of more public society, is required,
1. Regard to Superiors in Estate, Desert.
Inferiors, Equals.
2. Commer^^
more private society, Just maintenance of each man's propriety, Truth of
friendship.


IN respect of themselves, he requires due regard of degrees: whether of
superiors. Pr. 22.7.
The rich rules the poor; and as the fi^ing pot is for silver, Pr. 27.21.
and the furnace for gold, so is every ma^otryed according to his dignifie;
Ec. 8.10.
so as they that come from the holy place be not forgotten in the city where
they have done right: or whether of inferiors; Pr.
for, A poor man, if he oppress the poor, is like a raging rain that
leaves no food; Pr. 11.12 Pr. 14.21
yea (less then oppression) He that despises his neighbor is both a sinner
and destitute of understanding: or lastly, of equals; and therein, quiet and
peaceable demeanure, Pr. 3.30.
not striving with others causeless; not to begin co^entions, for, Pr. 17.14.
The beginning of strife is as one that opens the waters; therefore ere it
be meddled with, he leaves off; and being provoked, Pr. 25.9.
debateth the matter with his neighbor. Pr. 25.8.
And as he goes not forth hastily to strife: so much less does he take part
in impertinent quarrels: He that passes by, Pr. 26.17
and meddleth with the strife that belonges not to him, is as one that takes a
dog by the care; and one of the six things that God hates, Pr. 6.16 19.
is he that rayseth up contentions among neighbors.

Secondly, mutual commerce, and interchange of commodities; without which, is
no living: Ec. 5.8
The abundance of the earth is over all: and the King consists by the field
that is tilled. The husbandman therefore must till his land, Pr. 28.19
that he may be satisfied with bread; for, much increase comes by the
strength of the Ox: Pr. 14.4
and moreover, he must sell corn, Pr. 11.26
that blessings may be upon him; which if he withdraw, the people shall curse
him; P. 24.30.
so that, the slothful man whose field is ouergrowen with thorns, and
nettles, is but an ill member: And again, Pr. 31.14.
the Merchant must bring his wares from far; and each so trade with other,
that both may live. Ec. 10.19
They prepare bread for laughter, and wine comforts the living* but silver
answers to all. F^r less public society, it required due reservation of
propriety; Pr. 22.28
not to remove the ancient bounds which his fathers have made; Pr. 23.10
not to enter into the field of the fatherless; for* he that redeemeth the^ is
mighty, Pr. 23.11.
Pr.
not to increase his riches by usury and interest, not to hasten overmuch to
be rich: Pr. 23.4
for such one knows not that poverty shall come upon him; Pr. 28.22
and that an heritage hastily gotten in the beginning, Pr. 28.20 Pr. 20.21
in the end thereof, shall not be blessed: and that in the mean time, The
man that is greedy of gain troubles his own house. Pr. 15.27
2. Truth of friendship. Pr. 18.24
A man that has friends, ought to show himself friendly: for a friend is
nearer then a brother; Thy own friend therefore, Pr. 27.10
and thy fathers friend forget thou not: for whether he reprove thee; Pr. 27.6
The wounds of a lover are faithful or whether he advise; As Ointment and
Perfui^^e rejoice the heart, Pr. 27.9
so does the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel: or whether he
exhort; Pr. 27.17
Iron sharpens iron, so does a man sharpen the face of his friend; and all
this, not in the time of prosperity only, as commonly, Pr. 19.4.
Riches gather many friends, and the poor is separated from his neighbor:
but contrarily, Pr. 17.17
A true friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity; in
all estates therefore, Pr. 27.19
as the face in the water answers to face, so the heart of man to man; who yet,
may not be too much pressed: Pr. 25.17.
Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbors house, least he be weary of thee, and
hate thee; Pr. 27.10
neither enter into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity: nor
again, too forward in profering kindness to his own loss; Pr. 17.1^
A man destitute of understanding touches the hand, and becomes surety for
his neighbor: Pr. 6.2. etc.
If therefore thou art become surety for thy neighbor (much more if thou have
strike^ hands with the stranger) thou art snared with the words of thine own
mouth, thou art even taken with the words of thine own mouth. Do this now my
son, Pr. 6.3
seeing thou art comne into the hand of thy neighbor (not having taken a
pledge for thy suretiship) go and humble thy self and solicit thy friends,
Pr. 27.13
Pr. 6.4
Give no sleep to thine eyes, nor slu^ber to thine ey lids. Pr. 6.5.
Deliver thy self as a Do from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the
hand of the fowler; and take it for a sure rule, Pr. 11.15
He that hates suretiship is sure.

SALOMONS OECONOMICKS, or Government of the FAMILY.

2 PARENT, CHILD.
3. MASTER, SERVANT.

Anno Domini, 1609.

SALOMONS OECONOMICKS, Or FAMILY.
. 1. The head of the Family in whom is required, Wisdom, Stayednesse, Thrift.

THe man is the head, and guide of the family; Ec. 7.13
Jn whom wisdom is good with an inheritance: for Through wisdom an house is
builded, Pr. 24.3
and established: which directs him to do all things in due order; first, Pr.
24.27
to prepare his work without, and then after to build his house; and
therewith, stayednes. For, Pr.
as a bird that wandreth from her neast, so is a man that wandreth from his
own place* and (which is the chief stay of his estate) thriftiness; Pr. 11.29
for, He that troubles his own house ( by excess) shall inherit the wind:
and the fool shall be servant to the wise in heart: for which purpose, Pr. 15.6
he shall find, that The house of the righteous shall have much treasure,
while the revenues of the wicked is but trouble: Pr. 15.16
or if not much; yet, Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, then great
treasure and trouble therewith: Howsoever, therefore, let him be content with
his estate: Let the lambs be sufficient for his clothing; Pr. 27.26
and let the goats be the price of his field. Pr. 27.27
Let the milk of his goats be sufficient for his food, for the food of his
family, and the sustenance of his maids: and if he have much revenue; let him
look for much expense. For, Ec. 5.10
When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good comes
to the owners thereof, but the beholding thereof with their eyes?

THE HUSBAND:. 2. Who must bear himself wisely, chastely, quietly, and
cheerfully.

Pr. 18.22
HE that finds a wise, finds a good thing, and receives favor of the
Lord: Who must therefore behave himself, 1. wisely, Pr. 2.17.
Pr. 12.4.
as the guide of her youth: as the head to which she is a crown: Pr. 5.15
2. chastely. Drink the water of thy own Cistern, and the rivers out of the
midst of thine own Well. The matrimonial love must be pure, and clear, not
muddy and troubled; Pr. 5.16
Let thy fountains flow forth, and the rivers of waters in the Streets; the
sweet and comfortable fruits of blessed marriage, in plentiful issue: Pr. 5.17
But let them be thine alone, and not the strangers with thee. This love
abides no partners: for, Pr. 5.9.
this were to give thine honor unto others, and thy strength to the cruel;
Pr. 5.10
so should the stranger be filled with thy strength, and ( as the substance
will be with the affections) thy labors should be in the house of a
stranger; and thou shall mourn ( which is the best success hereof) at thine
end, Pr. 5.11
when thou have consumed ( besides thy goods) thy flesh, and thy body, and
say: Pr. 5.12
How have I hated instruction, and mine heart despised correction. Pr. 5.14
I was almost plunged into all evil, of sin and torments, and that which is
most shameful, in the midst of the assembly, Pr. 5.18
in the face of the world. Let therefore that thy own fountain be blessed, and
rejoice with the wise of thy youth: Let her be as the loving Hind, Pr. 5.19
and pleasant Roe; let her breasts satisfy thee, Pr. 5.20
at all times, and err thou in her love continually; For why should thou
delight my son, in a strange woman; or ( whether in affection, or act)
embrace the bosom of a stranger? Pr. 5.21
For, the vvayes of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all
his paths: and if thy godlesnesse regard not that, yet for thy own sake,
Desire not her beauty in thy heart, Pr. 6.25
neither let her take thee with her eie-lids; for, Pr. 6.26.
because of the whorish woman, a man is brought to a morsel of bread, yea to
the very husks: and more then that; a Woman will hunt for the precious life
of a man. Thou say, Pr. 6.26
thou can escape this actual defilement. Pr. 6.27
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burnt? Pr. 6.28
Or can a man go upon coals, and his feet not be burnt? So, Pr. 6.29
he that goes in, to his Neighbors Wife, shall not be innocent, whosoever
touches her: This Sin is far more odious then theft: For, Pr. 6.30
men do not despise a Thief when he steals to satisfy his soul, because
he is hungry. But if he be found, Pr. 6.31
he shall restore seven fold, or he shall give all the substance of his
house; and it is accepted. Pr. 6.32
But, he that commits adultery with a woman, is mad: he that would destroy his
own soul, Pr. 6.33
let him do it: For, he shall find a wound and dishonor, and his reproache
shall never be put away: Neither is the danger less then the shame. For,
Pr. 6.34
jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore* the wronged husband will not spare,
in the day of vengeance. Pr. 6.35
He cannot bear the sight of any ransom; neither will he consent to remit
it, tho thou multiply thy gifts. And tho Stolen waters be sweet, Pr. 9.17.
and hid bread be pleasant to our corrupt taste; yet, Pr. 9.18.
the adulterer knows not that the dead are there: and that her guests are in
the deepes of hell, that her house tends to death; Pr. 2.18.19. Pr. 5.3.
And howsoever her lips drop as an hony-combe, and her mouth is more soft then
oil; yet the end of her is bitter as wormwood, Pr. 5.4.
and sharp as a two edged sword: her feet go down to death, Pr. 5.5.
and her steps take hold of hell: yea, Pr. 23.27.
The mouth of the strange woman is a deep pit, Pr. 22.14.
and he with whom the Lord is angry shall fall into it.

3. Quietly and lovingly: for, Pr. 15.17
Betteris a dinner of green herbs where love is, then a stalled ox, and hatred
therewith. Yea, Better is a dry morsel, Pr. 17.1.
if peace be with it; then an house full of sacrifices with strife. And if he
find sometime cause of blame; Pr. 19.11.
The discretion of a man differreth his anger, and his glory is to pass by an
offense: Pr. 17.9.
and only He that covers a transgression, seeks love: Ec. 9.9.
Rejoice with thy wife, whom thou have loved all the days of the life of thy
vanity, which God has given thee under the Sun. For, this is thy portion in
this life, and in the travels wherein thou labourest under the Sun.

THE WIFE.. 3. She must be 1. Faithful to her husband; Not wanton. 2.
Obedient, 3. Discreet, 4. Provident and hous-wife-like.

A Virtuous Wife is the Crown of her husband: Pr. 12.4.
Who shall find such a one? Pr. 31.10.
for her price is far above the pearls. She is true to her husbands bed;
Pr. 31.11.
such as the heart of her husband may trust to, Pr. 2.17.
as knowing that she is tied to him by the covenant of God; not wanton and
unchaste: Pr. 7.6.
such one as I once saw from the window of my house: I looked through my
window, Pr. 7.7.
and saw among the fools, Pr. 7.7.
and considered among the children a young man wanting wit, Pr. 7.8.
who passed through the street by her corner, and went toward her house, in
the twilight, Pr. 7.9.
in the evening, when the night began to be black and dark, so as he
thought himself unseen; Pr. 7.10.
and behold there met him ( the same he sought for) a woman with an harlots
fashion, and close in heart, as open in her habit. Pr. 7.11.
She is babbling and perverse; whose feet ( contrary to the manner of all
modest wives, Pr. 11.16.
which only attain honor) cannot abide in her house; Pr. 7.11.
but are over gadding. Pr. 7.12.
Now she is without the gates, now in the streets, Pr. 23.28.
and lies in wait in every corner; or at the least, sits at the door of
her house, Pr. 9.14.
on a seat in the hie places of the city: so she ( not staying to be solicited)
caught him by the neck, Pr. 7.13.
and kissed him, and with an impudent face, said unto him, I have the flesh of
peace offerings, Pr. 7.14.
( both good cheer, and religion pretended) this day have I paid my vows: Pr.
7.15.
therefore I came forth, on purpose to meet thee, that I might earnestly
seek thy face, of all others; and now, how happy am J that J have found thee.
Pr. 7.16.
I have decked my bed with ornaments, with curtains, and strings of Egypt.
Pr. 7.17.
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon, that we may lie
sweet; Pr. 7.18.
Come go, let us take our fill of loves, until the morning, let us take our
pleasure in dalliance; fear nothing, Pr. 7.19.
For my husband is not at home, he is gone a journey far off, neither
need thou to doubt his return; for he has taken with him a bag of
silver, Pr. 7.20.
and will come home at his set day: sooner he cannot; this she said: what
followed? By the abundance of the sweetness of her speech, Pr. 7.21.
she caused him to yield: and with the flattery of her lips, she intised
him; Pr. 7.22.
and straight ways he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter, and as a
fool to the stocks for correction, till a dart strike through his liver, the
seat of his lust: Pr. 7.23.
or as a bird hasteneth to the snare, and knows not that it is against his
own life: thus she does, and when her husband returns, Pr. 30.20.
she wipeth her mouth, and says I have not committed iniquity. (2.) She is
duetifull and obedient; Pr. 15.1.
by a soft answer appeasing wrath: not hateful; for whom, Pr. 30.23.21.
a whole world is moved; not stubborn, not quarellous: for, Pr. 19.13 Pr.
27.15
the contentions (and brawlings) of a wife, are like a continual dropping in
the day of rain; a discomfort to the husband, a rotting to the house. So, Pr.
25.24.
It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top, then with a contentious
woman in a wide house. And tho, for society, Two be better then one; Ec. 4.9.
yet It is better to dwell alone in the wilderness, Pr. 27.19.
then with a contentious, and angry woman. For, herein as his grief cannot be
avoided, so his shame cannot be conceived. Pr. 27.16.
For, He that hides her, hides the wind; and she is as oil in his right
hand, that utters it self.

. 4. The good hous-wife (Pro. 31.) set forth by her Actions, In her own
person; Labors, Bargains, Liberal provision, for Her self, The poor, Her
family; husband servants.


In the oversight of her family.
Speeches, Disposition.

3. SHe is moreover prudent, and discreet. Pr. 14.1.
A wise woman builds her house; but the foolish destroys it with her own
hands: Pr. 11.22.
and As a ring of gold in a swines snowt, so is a fair woman which lacks
discretion. 4. Lastly, she is careful and hous-wifelike; so as She will do
her husband good, Pr. 31.12.
and not evil, all the days of her life: For, as for her actions, in her own
person, whether you look to her labors; Pr. 31.13.
She seeks wool and flax, and labors cheerfully with her hands. Pr.
31.15.
She rises while it is yet night: Pr. 31.17.
She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms. Pr. 31.19.
She puts her hands to the wheel; and her hands handle the spindle: or
whether, to her bargains; She considers a field, Pr. 31.16.
and gets it, and with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. Pr.
31.14.
She is like the ship of merchants, she brings her food from far; she
feels that her merchandise is good, her candle is not put out by night: Pr.
31.18.
she makes sheets and sells them, Pr. 31.24.
and gives girdles unto the merchants; or whether, to her liberal provision;
For her husband, Pr. 31.23.
who is known in the gates ( by her neat furnishing) when he sits with the
Elders of the land; 2. For her self, She makes her self carpets: Pr. 31.22.
fine linen and purple is her garment; 3. For her servants, Pr. 31.21.
She fears not the snow for her family, for all her family is clothed with
scarlet; 4. For the poor, Pr. 31.20^
She stretches out her hands to the poor, and puts forth her hands to
the needy; For her oversight of her family, she gives the portion to her
household, Pr. 13.15.
and the ordinary (or stint of work) to her maids: she ouerseeth the ways of
her household, Pr. 13.27.
and eats not the bread of idleness. For her speeches; she opens her mouth
with wisdom, Pr. 31.26.
and the law of grace is in her tongue. Lastly, Strength and honor is her
clothing, Pr. 31.25.
and in the latter day she shall rejoice. So worthy she is in all these, Pr.
31.28.
that her own children cannot contain, but rise up and call her blessed; and
her husband shall praise her, and say, Pr. 31.29.
Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou surmountest them all: Favor is
deceitful, Pr. 31.30.
and beauty is vanity; but a woman that fears the Lord, she shall be
praised: Since therefore she is so well deserving, Pr. 31.31.
Give her of the fruit of her own hands, and let her own works praise her.

PARENTS:. 5. Who owe to their children Provision, Instruction, Correction.

PArents and Children are the next pair; which do give much joy to each
other: Pr. 17.6.
Childrens children are the Crown of the elders, and the glory of the children
are their fathers: To which purpose, the Parent owes to the Child, 1.
Provision. A good man shall give inheritance to his childrens children. Pr.
13.22.
All the labor, wherein he has traveled, Ec. 2.18.
he shall leave to the man that shall be after him. Ec. 2.19.
And who knows whether he shall be wise or foolish: yet shall he rule over
all his labor wherein he has labored, and showed himself wise, under the
sun. Here are therefore two gross vanities, which I have seen: Ec. 4.8.
the one, There is one alone, and there is not a second, which has neither
son nor brother: yet is there none end of his travel, neither can his eye be
satisfied with riches; neither does he think, for whom do I travel, and
defraud my soul of pleasure. The other, contrary; riches reserved to the
owners thereof for their evil. Ec. 5.12.
And these riches perish in his evil business; Ec. 5.13.
and he begets a son, and in his hand is nothing. 2. Pr. 1.8.
Instruction and good education: for, Pr. 17.21.
He that begets a fool (whether naturally, or by ill breeding) begets
himself sorrow: and the father of a fool can have no joy. And therefore, Pr.
22.6.
Teach a child in the trade of his way: and when he is old, he shall not
depart from it. 3. Correction: Pr. 13.24.
He that spares his rod, hates his son: but he that loves him,
chasteneth betime; Pr. 22.15.
for foolishness is bound in the heart of a child: the rod of correction
shall drive it from him: yea, there is yet great benefit of due chasticement;
Pr. 29.15
for, The rod and correction give life: but a child set at liberty makes his
mother ( who is commonly faulty this way) ashamed; yea, more them shame, death
and hell follow to the child upon indulgence: ( only) If thou smite him with
the rod, Pr. 23.13
he shall not die: if thou smite him with the rod, Pr. 25.14
thou shall deliver his soul from hell. Pr. 4.3.
Tho thy son therefore be tender and dear in thy sight; Pr. 29.17
Correct him, and he will give thee rest, and will give pleasures to thy
soul: wherefore, Pr. 19.18.
Chasten him while there is hope; and let not thy soul spare, Pr. 19.19.
to his destruction. The son that is of a great stomach, shall endure
punishment: and tho thou deliver him, yet thou shall take him in hand again.

CHILDREN:. 6. Their duties; obedience to instructions, commandments.
submission to correction. care of their Parents estate, of their own carriage.


A Wise Son rejoices the Father, Pr. 15.20 Pr. 10.1.
Pr. 23.24
and The Father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice; whereas, Pr. 19.13.
The foolish is the calamity of his Parents: Contrarily, if thou be a wise
son, Pr. 29.3
or love wisdom, thy father and thy mother shall be glad, Pr. 23.25
and she that bare thee shall rejoice. Such a one is, first, Obedient; Pr. 13.1
for, A wise son will hear and obey the instruction of his father, Pr. 1.8.
and not forsake his mothers teaching; yea, in every command, pr. 23.22 Pr. 6.20
he will obey him that begot him, and not despise his mother when she is old;
not upon any occasion cursing his parents (as there is a generation that does):
Pr. 30.11
for, Pr. 20.20
He that curses his father, or mother, his light shall be put out in obscure
darkness; not mocking and scorning them; Pr. 15.20.
pr. 30.17
for, The eye that mocketh his father, and despises the instruction of his
mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles eat
it: and not obedient to counsel only, but to stripes; He that hates
correction is a fool: Pr. 12.1
and he that regards it, Pr. 15.5
is prudent. For, Pr. 6.23
those corrections that are for instruction, are the way of life: therefore,
he that hates them shall die. Secondly, Pr. 15.10
Careful both 1 of their estate: He that robs his father and mother, Pr.
28.24
and says it is no transgression, is a companion of a man that destroieth; and
2 of his own carriage: Pr. 19.26
for a lewd and shameful child destroys his father, and chaseth away his
mother. pr. 20.11
Let therefore even the child show himself to be known by his doings,
whether his work be pure and right: Pr. 23.16.
so his fathers reins shall rejoice, when he speaks and does righteous
things.

The MASTER, and SERVANT.. 7. The master must be Provident for his servant:
Not too severe, too familiar.

The servant must be faithful, diligent.


THe servant is no small commodity to his master. Pr. 12.9.
He that is despised, and has a servant of his own is better then he that
boasts (whether of gentry, or wealth) and wants bread. The master, therefore,
Pr. 27.27.
must provide sufficiency of food for his family, and sustenance for his
maids: who also as he may not be ouer-rigorous in punishing, or noting
offenses; sometimes not hearing his servant, Ec. 7.23
that curses him: so not too familiar; Pr. 29.21
for he that delicately brings up his servant from his youth, at length he
will be as his son. He must therefore be sometimes severe, more then in
rebukes; (For, Pr. 29.19.
A servant will not be chasticed with words: and tho he understand, yet he
will not regard) yet so, as he have respect ever to his good deseruings. Pr.
17.2.
A discreet servant shall rule over a lewd son: and he shall divide the
heritage among the brethren. Jn answer whereto, the good servant must be
faithful unto his master; Pr. 25.13
As the cold of snow in time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them
that send him, for he refreshes the soul of his master. Pr. 13.17.
A wicked messenger falls into evil: but a faithful ambassador is
preservation; Pr. 27.23.
and 2 diligent, Whether in his charge; Be diligent to know the estate of thy
flock ( or rather, the face of thy cattle) and take heed to the heardes: or in
his attendance, Pr. 27.18
He that keeps his fig tree shall eat of the fruit of it: so he that
carefully waits on his master, shall come to honor, Pr. 10.26
where contrarily, in both these, As vinegar to the teeth, and smoke to the
eyes: so is a slothful messenger to them that send him.

FINIS.
AN OPEN AND plain Paraphrase, upon the SONG OF SONGS, Which is SALOMONS.

By IOS. HALL.

Anno Domini, 1609.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, MY Singular good Lord and Patron, EDWARD Lord Denny,
Baron of Waltham, All Grace and Happiness.
RIGHT HONORABLE:
WHen I would have withdrawn my hand from divine Solomon: the heavenly
elegance of this his best Song drew me unto it; and would not suffer me to
take off mine eyes, or pen. Who can read it with understanding, and not be
transported from the world; from himself? and be any other where, save in
heaven, before his time? I had rather spend my time in admiration, then
Apology: Surely, here is nothing that savors not of ecstasy, and spiritual
rauishment; neither was there ever so high and passionate a speculation
delivered by the spirit of God, to mankind: which by how much more divine it
is, by so much more difficult: It is well, if these mysteries can be found out
by searching. Two things make the Scriptures hard: Prophecies, Allegories; both
are met in this: but the latter so sensibly to the weakest eyes, that this
whole Pastoral-mariage-song (for such it is) is no other then one Allegory
sweetly continued: where the deepest things of God are spoken in riddles, how
can there be but obscurity and diverse construction? All judgments will not (I
know) subscribe to my senses; yet I have been fearful and spiritually nice
in my choice, not often dissenting from all interpreters; always, from the
unlikeliest. It would be too tedious to give my account for every line: let
the learned scanne and judge. What-euer others censures be, your Honors was
favorable; and (as to all mine) full of love and encouragement. That,
therefore, which it pleased you to allow from my pen, vouchsafe to receive
from the Press; more common, not less devoted to you. What is there of mine
that does not joy in your name, and boast it self in serving you? To whose
soul and people, I have long agone addicted my self, and my labors; and
shall ever continue

Your Lordships, in all humble and unfeigned duty, IOS. HALL.

SALOMONS Song of Songs, paraphrased.
CHAP. I.
Dialog. The Church, to CHRIST. OH that he would bestow upon me the
comfortable testimonies of his love, 1 Let him kiss me, with the kisses of his
mouth; for, thy love is better then wine.
and that he would vouchsafe me yet a nearer conjunction with himself; as in
glory hereafter, so for the mean time in his sensible graces. For, thy love, O
my Savior, and these fruits of it, are more sweet unto me, then all earthly
delicates can be to the bodily taste.

2. Because of the savor of thy good ointme^ts, thy name is as an oinme^t
powered out: therefore the Virgins love thee
Yea, so wonderfully pleasant are the savors of those graces that are in thee,
wherewith I desire to be endued; that al, whom thou have blessed with the sense
thereof, make as high and dear account of thy Gospel, whereby they are
wrought, as of some precious ointment, or perfume: the delight whereof is such,
that (heereuppon) the pure and holy souls of the faithful, place their whole
affection, upon thee.

Pull me therefore out from the bondage of my sins: 3. Draw me, we will run
after thee: the king has brought me into his cha^bers, we will rejoice, and be
glad in thee: we will remember thy love, more then vine, the righteous do love
thee.
deliver me from the world, and do thou powerfully incline my will, and
affections toward thee: and in spite of all tentations, give me strength to
cleave unto thee; and then both I, and all those faithful children thou have
given me, shall all at once with speed and earnestness walk to thee, and
with thee: yea, when once my royal and glorious husband has brought me both
into these lower rooms of his spiritual treasures on earth, and into his
heavenly chambers of glory, then will we rejoice and be glad in none, but
thee; which shall be all in all to us: then will we celebrate and magnify thy
love, above all the pleasures we found upon earth; for, all of us thy righteous
ones, both Angels and Saints, are inflamed with the love of thee.

4. I am black O daughters of Jerusalem, but comely: If I be as the tents of
Kedar, yet I am as the curtains of Solomon.
Never vpbraid me (O ye foreign congregations) that I seem in outward
appearance discolored by my infirmities, and duskish with tribulations: for,
what soever I seem to you, I am yet inwardly wel-fauoured in the eyes of him,
whom I seek to please; and tho I be to you black like the tents of the
Arabian shepherds: yet to him and in him, I am glorious and beautiful, like the
curtains of Solomon.

Look not therefore disdainefully upon me, 5. Regard ye me not, because I am
black: for the sun has looked upon me; the sons of my mother were angry
against me: they made m^ keeper of the vines: but I kept not min^ own vine.
because I am blackish, and dark of hew: for, this color is not so much
natural to me; as caused by that continual heat of afflictions wherewith I
have been usually scorched: neither this, so much upon my own just desert, as
upon the rage and envy of my false brethren, the World: who would needs force
upon me the observation of their idolatrous religions, and superstitious
impieties; through whose wicked importunity, and my own weakness, I have
not so entirely kept the sincere truth of God committed to me, as I ought.

6. Show me, O thou whom my soul loves, where thou feedest, where thou lie
at noon: for why should I be as she that turns aside to the flocks of thy
companions?
Now therefore, that I am some little started aside from thee, O thou whom my
soul notwithstanding dearly loves, show me, I beseech thee, where, and in
what wholesome and divine pastures thou (like a good shepherd) feedest, and
restest thy flocks with comfortable refreshings, in the extremity of these
hot persecutions: for, how can it stand with thy glory, that I should through
thy neglect, thus suspiciously wander up and down, amongst the congregations
of them that both command and practice the worship of false gods.


CHRIST, to the Church. IF thou know not, 7. If thou know not, O thou the
fairest among women, get thee forth by the steps of the flock: and feed thy
Kids above the tents of the shepherds.
o thou my Church, who^ I both esteem and have made most beutifull by my
merits, and thy sanctification: stray not amongst these false worshippers, but
follow the holy steps of those blessed Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, which
have bin my true and ancient flock; who have both known my voice, and
followed me: and feed thou my weak and tender ones with this their spiritual
food of life; far above the carnal reach of those other false teachers.

8. I have compared thee, O my Love, to the troops of horses in the chariots of
Pharaoh.
Such is mine estimation of thee, O my Love, that so far as the choicest
Egyptian horses of Pharaoh, for comely shape, for honorable service, for
strength and speed, exceed all other, so far thou excellest all that may be
compared with thee.

9. Thy cheeks are comely with rows of stones, and thy neck with chains.
Those parts of thee, which both are the seats of beauty, and most conspicuous
to the eye, are gloriously adorned with the graces of my sanctification; which
are for their worth as so many precious borders of the goodliest stones, or
chains of pearl.

10. We will make thee borders of gold, with studs of silver
And tho thou be already thus set forth: yet I and my father have purposed a
further ornament unto thee, in the more plentiful effusion of our spirit upon
thee: which shall be to thy former deckings, in stead of pure gold curiously
wrought with specks of silver.


The Church. BEhold (O ye daughters) even now, 11. While the king was at his
repast, my spiknard gave the smell thereof.
whiles my Lord and King seems far distant from me, and sits in the throne
of heaven amongst the companies of Angels (who attend around upon him) yet now
do I find him present with me in spirit; even now, the sweet influence of his
graces, like to some precious ointme^t, spreds it self over my soul; and
returns a pleasant favor into his own nosthrils.

12. My well-beloved is as a bundle of myrrh unto me, lying between my breasts.
And tho I be thus delightful to my Savior, yet nothing so much as he is unto
me: for lo, as some fragrant pomander of myrrh, laid between the breasts,
sends up a most comfortable sent; so, his love, laid close unto my heart, does
still give me continual and unspeakable refreshings.

13. My well-beloved is as a cluster of Cypers unto me among the vines of Engeddy.
Or if any thing can be of more excellent virtue, such smell as the clusters of
cypersberries, within the fruitfulst, pleasantst, and richest vineyards, and
garde^s of Iudaea, yield unto the passengers; such and more delectable do I
find the savor of his grace to me.


CHRIST. NEither do thou on my part lose any of thy love, 14. My Love behold
thou art fair, thine eyes are like the doves
O my dear Church: for, behold; in mine eyes, thus clothed as thou art with my
righteousness, oh how fair and glorious thou art; how above all comparison
glorious and fair! thine eyes (which are thy seers, Prophets, Apostles,
Ministers) and those inward eyes, whereby thou see him that is invisible, are
full of grace, chastity, simplicity.


The Church. 15. My wel-beloued, behold, thou art fair and pleasant: also our
bed is green.
NAy then (O my sweet savior and spouse) thou alone art that fair and pleasant
one indeed, from whose fullness I confess to have received all this little
measure of my spiritual beauty: and behold, from this our mutual delight, and
heavenly coniunctio^, there arises a plentiful and flourishing increase of thy
faithful ones, in all places, and through all times.

16. The beams of our house are cedars, our galleries are of fur.
And behold, the congregations of Saints, the places where we do sweetly
converse and walk together, are both firm and during (like cedars amongst the
trees) not subject through thy protecting grace to utter corruption; and
through thy favorable acceptance and word (like to galleries of sweet wood)
full of pleasure and contentment.


CHAP. II.
Christ. THou have not without just cause magnified me, 1. I am the Rose of
the field, and the Lilly of the valleys.
O my Church: for, as the fairest and sweetest of all flowers which the earth
yields, the rose and lilly of the valleys, excel for beauty, for pleasure,
for use, the most base and odious weeds that grow; so does my grace, to al
them that have felt the sweetness thereof, surpass all worldly contentments.

2. Like a lilly among the thorns, so is my Love among the daughters.
Neither is this my dignity alone: but thou O my spouse (that thou may be a
fit match for me) art thus excellent above the world, that no lilly can be
more in goodly show beyond the naked thorn, then thou in thy glory thou
receiuest from me, ouer-lookest all the assemblies of aliens and vnregenerates.


The Church. 3. Like the Apple Tree among the trees of the forest, so is my
wel-beloued among the sons of men: under his shadow had I delight, and sat
down; and his fruit was sweet unto my mouth.
ANd (to return thine own praises) as some fruitful and wel-growen Apple Tree,
in comparison of all the barren trees of the wild forest: so art thou (O my
beloved savior) to me, in comparison of all men, and angels; under thy
comfortable shadow alone, have I ever wont to find safe shelter against all
mine afflictions, all my tentations and infirmities, against all the curses of
the Law, and dangers of judgment, and to cool my self after all the
scorching beams of thy fathers displeasure, and (besides) to feed and satisfy
my soul with the sovereign fruit of thy holy word; unto eternal life.

He has graciously led me by his spirit, 4. He brought me into the wine
cellar, and love was his banner over me.
into the midst of the mysteries of godliness; and has plentifully broached
unto me the sweet wines of his Scriptures, and sacrament. And look how
soldiers are drawn by their colors, from place to place, and cleave fast to
their ensign: so his love, which he spread forth in my heart, was my only
ba^ner, whereby I was both drawn to him, directed by him, and fastened upon him.

5. Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples: for, I am sick of love.
And now, O ye faithful Evangelists, Apostles, Teachers apply unto me, with all
care and diligence, all the cordial promises of the Gospel: these are the full
flagons of that spiritual wine, which only can cheer up my soul; these are
the apples of that tree of life, in the midst of the garden, which can feed
me to immortality. Oh come and apply these unto my heart: for, I am even
overcome with a longing expectation and desire of my delayed glory.

And whilst I am thus spiritually languishing in this agony of desire; 6. His
left hand be under my head: and let his right hand embrace me.
let my Savior employ both his hands to relieve mine infirmity: let him
comfort my head and my heart, my judgment and affections (which both complain
of weakness) with the lively heat of his gracious imbracements: and so let
us sweetly rest together.

7. I charge you O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the Hinds of the
field, that ye stir not up, nor waken my Love, until he please.
In the mean time, I charge you (O all ye that profess any friendship or
affinity with me) I charge you, by whatsoever is comely, dear, and pleasant
unto you, as you will avoid my uttermost censures, take heed how you vex and
disquiet my merciful Savior, and grieve his spirit, and wrong his name, with
your vain and lewd co^uersatio^; and do not dare by the least provocation of
your sin to interrupt his peace

8. It is the voice of my wel-beloued: behold he comes leaping by mountains
and skipping by the hills.
Lo, I have no sooner called, but he hears and answers me with his loving
voice: neither does he only speak to me afar, but he comes to me with much
willingness and celeritie; so willingly, that no humane resistaunce can hinder
him, neither the hillocks of my lesser infirmities, nor the mountains of my
grosser sins (once repented of) can stay his merciful pase toward me.

So swiftly, that no Roe, 9. My Well-beloved is like a Roe, or a young Heart: lo,
he stands behind our wall, looking forth of the windows, showing himself
through the grates.
or Hind, can fully resemble him in this his speed and nimbleness: and lo,
even now, before I can speak it, is he come near unto me; close to the door
and wall of my heart. And tho this wall of my flesh hinder my full fruition of
him: yet lo, I see him by the eye of faith, looking upon me; I see him as in a
glass; I see him shining gloriously, through the grates and vvindowes of his
Word and Sacraments, upon my soul.

10. My Well-beloved spoke, and said unto me, arise my Love, my fair one, and
come thy way
And now, me thinks, I hear him speak to me in a gracious invitation and
say, Arise (O my Church) rise up, whether from thy security, or fear: hide not
thy head any longer, O my beautiful Spouse for danger of thine enemies:
neither suffer thy self to be pressed with the dullness of thy nature, or the
careless sleep of thy sins; but come forth into the comfortable light of my
presence, and show thy self cheerful in me.

11. For, behold winter is past, the rain is changed and gone way.
For behold, all the cloudie winter of thy afflictions is passed, all the
tempests of tentations are blown over; the Heaven is clear, and now there is
nothing that may not give thee cause of delight.

Every thing now resembles the face of a spiritual Spring; 12. The flowers
appear in the earth: the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice
of the turtle is heard in our land.
all the sweet flovvers and blossoms of holy profession put forth, and show
themselves in their opportunities: now is the time of that heavenly melody,
which the cheerful Saints and Angels make in mine ears; while they sing
songs of deliverance and praise me with their Alleluiahs and say, Glory to God
on hie, in earth peace, goodwill toward men.

13. The fig tree has brought forth her young figs and the vines with their
small grapes have cast a savor: arise my Love, my fa^re one, and come away.
What speak I of blossoms? behold, those fruitful vines, and fig trees of my
faithful ones, whom my husbandry has carefully tended and dressed, yield
forth both pleasant (tho tender) fruits of obedience, and the wholesome and
comfortable savors of better desires: wherefore, now O my dear Church, shake
off all that dull security, wherewith thou have been held; and come forth,
and enjoy me.

14. My Dove, thou art in the hoales of the rock, in the secret places of the
cliftes: show me thy sight, let me hear thy voice: for thy voice is sweet
and thy sight comely.
O my beautiful, pure, and chaste spouse, which like unto some solitary dove
have long hid thine head in the secret and inaccessible clifts of the rocks,
out of the reach and knowledge of thy persecutours; how-euer thou art
concealed from others, show thy self in thy works and righteousness, unto me:
and let me be ever plied with thy words of imploration, and thanksgiving: for
thy voice (tho it be in mourning) and thy face (tho it be sad and blubbered)
are exceedingly pleasing unto me.

And in the mean time (O all ye that wish well to my Name and Church) do
your utmost endeavor, 14. Take us the foxes, the little foxes which destroy the
vines: for our vines have small grapes.
to deliver her from her secret enemies (not sparing the least) who either by
heretical doctrine, or profane conversation, hinder the course of the Gospel;
and pervert the faith of many; especially of those, that have newly given up
their names to me, and are but newly entered into the profession of godliness.

16. My Well-beloved is mine, and I am his: he feeds among the Lillies.
My beloved Savior is mine, through my faith; and I am his through his love: and
we both are one, by virtue of that blessed union on both parts; whereby we
mutually enjoy each other, with all sufficient contentment. And how worthily is
my love placed upon him, who leads me forth into pleasant pastures; and at
whose right hand there is the fullness of joy for evermore?

Come therefore (O my Savior) and until the day of thy glorious appearance
shall shine forth to the world, 17. Until the day break and the shadows flee
away; return my Well-beloved, and be like a Roe or a young Heart upon the
mountains of Bether.
wherein our spiritual marriage shall be consummate, and until all these
shadows of ignorance, of infidelity, of troubles of conscience, and of
outward tribulations be utterly dispersed, and chased away; come and turn
thee to me again: thou which to the carnal eyes of the world seem absent;
come quickly and delay not: but, for the speed of thy return be like unto some
swift Roe, or Hind, upon those smooth hills of Gilead, which Jordan seuers from
the other part of Jury.


CHAP. III.
1. In my bed, by night I sought him that my soul loved: I soght him, but I
found him not.
MY security told me that my Savior was near unto my soul, yea with it, and in
it: but when by serious and silent meditation I searched my own heart, I
found that (for ought my own sense could discern) he was far off from me.

2. I will rise therefore now, and go about in the City by the streets, and
by open places, and will seek him that my soul loves: I soght him, but I
found him not.
Then thought I with my self, Shall I lie still contented with this want? No,
I will stir up my self: and the help I cannot find in my self, I will
seek in others; Of all that have been experienced in all kind of
difficulties: of all deep Philosophers, of the wisest and honestest worldlings,
I will diligently enquire for my Savior: amongst them I sought him, yet could
receive no answer to my satisfaction.

Missing him there, 3, The watchmen that went about the City, found me: to whom
I said, have you seen him whom my soul loves?
I ran to those wise and careful Teachers, whom God has set, as so many
watchmen upon the walls of his Jerusalem, who sooner found me then I could
ask after them; to whom I said, (as thinking no man could be ignorant of
my love) Can you give me no direction where I might find him, whom my soul
loves?

4. When I had past a little from them, then I found him who^ my soul loves:
I took hold on him, and left him not, till I had brought him unto my mothers
house into the chamber of her that conceived me.
Of whom when I had almost left hoping for comfort, that gracious Savior who
would not suffer me tempted above my measure, presented himself to my soul:
Lo then, by a new act of faith, I laid fast hold upon him, and will not let
him any more part from my joyful embracements; until both I have brought him
home fully into the seat of my conscience, and have won him to a perpetual
cohabitation with me; and a full accomplishment of my love, in that Jerusalem
which is above, which is the mother of us all.


CHRIST. NOw that my distressed Church has been, 5. I charg ye o daughters of
Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the Hinds of the field, that ye stir not up
nor wake^ my love until she please.
all the Night long of my seeming absence, toyled in seeking me, I charge you
(O all that profess any friendship with me) I charge you by whatsoever is
comely, dear, and pleasant unto you, that (as you will answer it) you trouble
not her peace with any unjust or unseasonable suggestions, with uncharitable
contentions, with any Novelties of doctrine; but suffer her to rest sweetly,
in that divine truth, which she has received, and this true apprehension of
me wherein she rejoices.

6. Who is she that comes up out of the wilderness, like pillars of smoke
perfumed with myrrh and incense, and with all the chief spices?
Oh who is this, how admirable? how lovely? who but my Church, that ascends
thus gloriously out of the wilderness of the world, wherein she has thus
long vvandered, into the blessed mansions of my fathers house; all perfumed
with the graces of perfect sanctification, mounting right upward into her
glory, like some straight pillar of smoke, that arises from the most rich
and pleasant composition of odours that can be devised.


The Church. I Am ascended; 7. Behold his bed better then Salomons: threescore
strong men are round about it, of the valiant men of Israel.
and lo how glorious is this place where I shall eternally enjoy the presence
and love of my Savior; how far does it exceed the earthly magnificence of
SOLOMON: about his bed do attend a guard of threescore choysest men of
Israel.

All stout VVarriers, 8. They all handle the sword, and are expert in war every
one has his sword upon his thigh, for the fear by night.
able and expert to handle the sword; which, for more readiness, each of them
wears hanging upon his thigh, so as it may be hastily drawn upon any
sudden danger: but about this heavenly pauilion of my Savior, attend
millions of Angels, spiritual Soldiers, mighty in power, ready to be
commanded service by him.

9. King Solomon made himself a bed of the trees of Lebanon.
The Bride-bed that SOLOMON made (so much admired of the World) was but of the
Cedars of Lebanon.

10. He made the pillars thereof of silver, and the sted thereof of gold, the
hangings thereof of purple, whose midst was in-layde with the love of the
daughters of Jerusalem.
The Pillars but of silver, and the bed-steed of gold; the Tester or Canopie
but of purple; the couerlet wrought with the curious and painful
needle-worke of the maids of JERUSALEM: but this celestial resting place of
my GOD is not made with hands, not of any corruptible metal, but is full of
incomprehensible light, shining evermore with the glorious presence of GOD.

And as the outward state, 11. Come forth ye daughters of Sion, and behold
the King Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of
his marriage, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
so the majesty of his person is above all comparison. Come forth (O ye
daughters of Sion) lay aside all private and earthly affections, look upon
king SOLOMON as he sits solemnlie crowned in the day of his greatest
royalty and triumph, and compare his highest pomp with the divine
magnificence of my Savior; in that day when his blessed marriage shall be
fully perfited above, to the eternal rejoicing of himself, and his Church;
and see whether there be any proportion betwixt them.


CHAP. IIII.
CHRIST. 1. Behold, thou art fair my Love, behold thou art fair, thine eyes
are like the doves within thy locks, thine hair is like a flock of goats
which look down from the mountains of Gilead.
OH how fair thou art and comely, my deer Spouse; how inwardely fair with the
gifts of my Spirit; how fair outwardly in thy comely administration, and
government: thy spiritual eyes of understanding, and judgment, are full of
purity, chastity, simplicity; not wantonly cast forth, but modestly shining
amidst thy locks: all thy gracious profession and all thy appendances, and
ornaments of expedient ceremonies, are so comely to behold, as it is to see a
flock of well-sed goats grasing upon the fruitful hills of Gilead.

Those that chew and prepare the heavenly food for thy soul, 2. Thy teeth are
like a flock of sheep in good order which go up from the washing: which every
one bring out twins, and none is barren among them.
are both of gracious simplicity, and of sweet accordance one with another;
having all one heart, and one tongue: and both themselves are sanctified, and
purged from their uncleannesses, and are fruitful in their holy labors unto
others; so that their doctrine is never in vain, but is still answered with
plentiful increase of souls added to the Church.

3. Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy talk is comely; thy temples
are within thy lock as a piece of a pomgranate.
Thy speech (especially in the mouth of thy teachers) is both gracious in it
self, and such as administers grace to the hearers; full of zeal and fervent
charity, full of gravity and discretion: and that part of thy countenance,
which thou will have seen (tho dimly and sparingly) is full of holy modesty
and bashfulnesse; so blushing, that it seems like the color of a broken
piece of pomgranate.

Those, 4. Thy neck is as the tower of David, built for defense: a thousand
shields hang therein, and all the targets of the strong men.
who by their holy authority sustain thy government (which are as some
straight and strong neck to bear up the head) are like unto David's hie tower
of defense, furnished with a rich armory; which affords infinite ways of safe
protection, and infinite momuments of victory.

Thy two testaments (which are thy two full and fair breasts whereby thou
nursest all thy faithful children) are as two twins of Kiddes: twins, 5.
Thy two breasts are as two young Kids that are twins, feeding among the Lillies.
for their excellent and perfect agreement, one with another, in all
resemblances: of Kiddes, that are daintily fed among the sweet flowers, for
the pleasant nourishment, which they yield to all that suck thereof.

6. Until the day break and the shadows fly away, I will go into the
mountain of myrrh, and to the mountain of incense.
Until the day of my gracious appearance shall shine forth, and until all
these shadows of ignorance, infidelity, afflictions, be utterly and suddenly
dispersed, O my spouse, I will retire my self (in regard of my bodily
presence) into my delightful and glorious rest of heaven.

7. Thou art all far my love, and there is no spot in thee.
Thou art exceeding beautiful, O my Church, in all the parts of thee: for, all
thy sins are done away, and thine iniquity is covered, and lo I present
thee to my father without spot, or wrinkle, or any such deformity.

And now, 8. Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, even with me from Lebanon,
and look from the top of Amanah, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the
dens of the Lions, and from the mountains of the Leopards.
(O thou which I profess to have married to my self in truth and
righteousness) thou shall be gathered to me from all parts of the world: not
only from the confines of Judea, where I planted and found thee, but from the
remotest and most savage places of the nations; out of the company of infidels,
of cruel and bloody persecutors, who like Lions and Leopards have tyrannized
over thee, and mercilessely torn thee in pieces.

Thou have utterly ravished me from my self (O my sister and spouse; for so
thou art, 9. My sister my spouse, thou have ^ounded my heart with one of thine
eyes: and with a chain of thy neck.
both joined to me in that spiritual union, and coheire with me of the same
inheritance, and glory) thou have quite ravished my heart with thy love: even
one cast of one of thine eyes of faith; and one of the ornaments of thy
sanctification where with thou art decked by my spirit, have thus stricken me
with love: how much more, when I shall have a full sight of thee, and all thy
graces, shall I be affected toward thee.

10. My sister, my spouse; how fair is thy love; how much better is thy love
the^ wine, and the savor of thine ointments then all spices?
O how excellent, how precious, how delectable are those loves of thine, O my
sister, my spouse; how far surpassing all earthly delicates; and the savor
of those divine virtues, wherewith thou art endued, more pleasing to my sent,
then all the perfumes in the world.

The gracious speeches that proceed from thee, 11. Thy lips, my spouse, drop
as honycombs: honey and milk are under thy tongue, and the savor of thy
garments is as the savor of Lebanon.
are as so many drops of the honie-combe that fall from thy lips: and
whether thou exhort, or confess, or pray, or comfort, thy words are both
sweet and nourishing; and the savor of thy good works, and outward
conversation, is to me as the smell of the wood of Lebanon to the sense of
man.

12. My sister my spouse, is as a garden enclosed, as a spring shut up, and a
fountain sealed up.
My sister, my spouse, is as a garden or orchard full of all variety of the
heavenly trees, and flowers of grace; not lying carelessly open, either to the
love of strangers, or to the rage of enemies, which like the wild Bore out of
the wood, might root up, and destroy her choice plants: but safely hedged and
walled about, by my protection, and reserved for my delight alone; she is a
spring and Well of wholesome waters, from whom flow forth the pure streams
of my word; but, both enclosed and sealed up: partly, that she may the better
(by this closeness) preserve her own natural taste; and vigor, from the
corruptions of the world; and partly, that she may not be defiled and mudded by
the profane feet of the wicked.

Thou art an orchard, 13. Thy plants are as an orchard of pomegranats with
sweet fruits: as Cipers, Spikenard, even Spikenard and Saffron, Calamus and
Cinamo^, with all the trees of Incense, Mirrh and Aloes with all the chief
spices.
yea a paradise, whose plants (which are thy faithful children that grow up in
thee) are as pomgranate trees; the apples whereof are esteemed, for the
largeness, color and taste, above all other: or (if I would feed my other
senses) the plentiful fruits of thy holy obedience (which thou yieldest unto
me) are for their smell as some composition of Cipresse, Spikenard, Saffron,
sweet Cane, Cinnamon, Incense, Myrrh, Aloes, and whatsoever else may be
devised, unto the most perfect sent.

14. O fountain of the gardens, O well of living waters and the springs of
Lebanon.
Thou art so a spring in my garden, that the streams which are derived from
thee, water all the gardens of my particular congregations, all the world over:
thou art that fountain, from whose pure head issue all those living waters,
which who-so drinks, shall never thirst again; even such clear currents, as
flow from the hill of Libanus, which like unto another Jordan, water all the
Israel of God.


The Church. IF I be a garden, 15. Arise O North, and come O South, and blow
on my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out: let my wel-beloued come to
his garden, and eat his pleasant fruit
as thou say (O my Savior) then arise, O all ye Souerain winds of the spirit
of God, and breath upon this garden of my soul; that the sweet odours of these
my plants, may both be increased, and may also be dispersed afar, and
carried into the nosthrils of my wel-beloued: and so let him come into this his
own garden (which his own hand has dug, planted, watered) and accept of
the fruit of that service and praise, which he shall enable me to bring forth
to his name.


CHAP. V.
CHRIST. 1. I am come into my garden, my sister, my Spouse: I gathered my myrrh
with my spice; I eat my honey with my honey comb, I drank my wine with my milk:
eat O my friends drink, and make you merry O well-beloved.
Behold, according to thy desire, I am come into my garden, O my sister, my
spouse; I have received those fruits of thine obedience which thou offerest
unto me, with much joy: and pleasure. I have accepted not only of thy good
works, but thy endeavors and purposes of holiness: both which are as
pleasant to me, as the honey and the honey comb. I have allowed of the
cheerfulness of thy service, and the wholesomnesse of thy doctrine. And ye, O
my friends, whether blessed Angels, or faithful men, partake with me in this
joy arising from the faithfulness of my Church: cheer up and fill your
selves, O my beloved, with the same spiritual dainties vvherevvith I am
refreshed.


The Church. WHen the world had cast me into a secure sleep, 2. I sleep, but
my heart waketh: it is the voice of my Well-beloved that knocks, saying, open
unto me my sister, my Love, my dove, my undefiled: for mine head is full of
dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
or slumber rather (for my heart was not utterly bereaved of a true faith, in my
Savior) even in this darkness of my mind, it pleased my gracious Redeemer
not to neglect me; he came to me, and knocked often, and called importunately
at the door of my heart, by his word and chastisements, and said; Open the
door of thy Soul, O my sister, my dear, chaste, comely, unspotted Church:
let me come in, and lodge and dwell with thee, in my graces; shut out the
world, and receive me with a more lively act, and renouation of thy faith. For
lo, I have long waited patiently for this effect of thy love, and have endured
all the injuries both of the night, and weather of thy prouocations, that I
might at last enjoy thee.

I answered him again, 3. I have put off my coat: how shall I put it on? I have
washed my feet: how shall I defile them.
pleading excuses for my delay; Alas Lord, I have now, since I left my forward
profession of thee, avoided a great number of cares and sorrows: must I take
them up again to follow thee? I have lived clean from the soil of these
evils: and shall I now thrust my self into danger of them?

When my Savior heard this unkind answer of delay: 4. My wel-beloued put his
hand from the hole of the door; and my bowels yearned toward him.
he let his hand fall from the keyhole, which he had thus before without
success labored about; and withdrew himself from soliciting me any more:
whereupon my heart and bowels yearned within me for him, and for the remorse of
my so long foreslowing his admittance unto me.

5. I rose up to open to my wel-beloued, and my hands did drop down myrrh, and
my fingers pure myrrh upon the handles of the bars.
And now I rouzed up my drousy heart (what I could) that I might in some
cheerful manner desire to receive so gracious a Savior: which when I but
indeauoured, I found that he had left behind him such a plentiful blessing
(as the monument of his late presence) upon the first motions of my heart, as
that with the very touch of them I was both exceedingly refreshed, and moved
to further indignation at my self for delaying him.

I opened to my beloved Savior: 6. I opened to my Well-beloved: but my
Well-beloved was gone and past; mine heart was gone when he did speak: I soght
him but I could not find him; I called him, but he answered me not.
but my Savior had now (in my feeling) withdrawn himself, and hid his
countenance from me, holding me short of those gracious offers, and means
which I had refused; and now I was almost past my self with despair, to
remember that sweet inuitation of his, which I neglected: I sought him
therefore in my thoughts, in the outward use of his ordinances, and of my
earnest prayers; but he would not as yet be found of me, or let me find that
I was heard of him.

Those which should have regarded me, 7. The watchmen that went about the City
found me, they smote me and wounded me: the watch men of the walls took away
my veil from me.
and by their vigilance have secured me from danger, proved mine adversaries:
instead of comforting me, they fell upon me, and wounded me with their false
doctrines, drawing me on into further errors, spoiling me of that purity and
sincerity of profession, wherewith as with some rich and modest veil I was
formerly adorned, and covered.

8. I charge you o daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my wel-beloued, that
you tell him I am sick of love.
I advise you solemnly, O all ye that wish well to me (for I care not who
knows the vehemency of my passion) if you shall find my Saviors presence in
your selves before me, pray for the recovery of his love to me; and bemone
my estate to him, tell him how I languish with the impatient desire of his love,
and presence to be restored unto me.

O thou which art the most happy, most gracious, 9. O the fairest among women,
what is thy well-beloved, more the^ another wel-beloued? what is thy well-beloved,
more then another lover, that thou do so charge us?
and most glorious of all creatures, the chosen of the living God; what is thy
well-beloved whom thou seek, above al other the sons of men? what such
eminency is there in him above all saints and angels: that thou art both so
far gone in affection to him; and do so vehemently adjure us to speak unto
him for thee? 10. My well-beloved is white and ruddy, the standerdbearer of ten
thousand.


My well-beloved (if you know not) is of perfect beauty; in whose face is an
exact mixture of the colors of the purest and healthfullest complexion of
holiness: for, he has not received the spirit by measure; and in him the
godhead dwells bodily; he is infinitely fairer, then all the sons of men;
and for goodliness of person may bear the standard of comeliness and grace
amongst ten thousand.

11. His head is as fine gold, his locks curled, and black as a raven.
The deity which dwells in him, is most pure and glorious: and that fullness
of grace which is communicated to his humane nature is wondrously beautiful,
and so sets it forth, as the black curled locks do a fresh and welfauoured
countenance.

His judgment of al things, 12. His eyes are like doves upon the rivers of
waters, which are washed with milk, and remain in their fullness.
and his respect to his Church (which are as his eyes) are full of love, and
full of pity, shining like unto doves washed in water, yea in milk, so as
there is no spot, or blemish to be found in them: and they are withal so
fully placed; as is both most comely and most expedient for the perfect sight
of the estate, and necessities of his servants.

The manifestation of himself to us in his word, 13. His cheeks are as a bed
of spices and as sweet flowers, and his lips like lillies dropping down pure
myrrh.
is sweet to our spiritual feeling, as an heap of spice, or those flowers
that are used to make the best perfuming oyntme^ts are to the other senses: his
heavenly instructions and promises of his Gospel are unspeakably comfortable,
and plentious, in the grace that is wroght by them.

14. His hands as rings of gold set with the chrisolit; his belly like white
Iuory covered with saphirs.
His actions, and his instruments (which are his hands) are set forth with much
port and majesty, as some precious stone beautifies the ring wherein* it is
set: the secret counsels of his breast, and the mysteries of his will are most
pure and holy, and full of excellent glory.

15. His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his
countenance as Lebanon, excellent as the Cedars.
All his proceedings are firm and stable; and withal, as pillars of marble set
in sockets of tried gold; so as they are neither subject to wavering, nor to
any danger of infirmity and corruption: the show and carriage of his whole
person whereby he makes himself known to his chosen, is exceeding goodly, and
upright like to the straight and lofty Cedars of Lebanon.

His mouth out of which, 16 His mouth is as sweet things, and he is wholly
delectable: this is my well-beloved, and this is my lover, O daughters of
Jerusalem.
proceeds innumerable blessings and comfortable promises, is to my soul even
sweetness it self; yea (what speak I of any one part?) as you have heard in
these particulars, he is as sweets: there is nothing but comfort in him; and
there is no comfort but in him; and this (if ye would know) is my well-beloved;
of so incomparable glory and worthiness, that ye may easily discern him from
all others.


Foreign Congregations. 17. O the fairest among women, whether is thy
Well-beloved gone? whither is thy Well-beloved turned aside, that we might seek him
with thee
SInce thy Well-beloved is so glorious, and amiable (O thou which art for thy
beauty worthy to be the Spouse of such an husband) tell us (for thou only
know it; and to seek Christ without the church we know is vain) tell us
where this Savior of thine is to be sought; that we (ravished also with the
report of his beauty) may ioin with thee in the same holy study of seeking
after him.


CHAP. VI.
MY Well-beloved Savior (if you would know this also) is to be sought and
found in the particular assemblies of his people, 1. My well-beloved is gone down
in to his garden to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and to gather
lillies.
which are his garden of pleasure, wherein are varieties of all the beds of
renewed souls, which both he has planted, and dressed by his continual care,
and wherein he walks for his delight; feeding and solacing himself with
those fruits of righteousness, and new obedience, which they are able to
bring forth unto him.

And now lo, 2. I am ^y welbeloueds, and my well-beloved is mine, who feeds
among the Lillies.
whatsoever has happened cross to me, in my sensible fruition of him; in
spite of al tentations, my beloved Savior is mine through faith; and I am his
through his love; and both of us are by an inseparable union knit together;
whose conjunction and love is most sweet, and happy for, all that are his, he
feeds continually with heavenly repast.


CHRIST. 3. Thou art beautiful my Love as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible
as an army with banners.
NOtwithstanding this thy late blemish of neglecting me, O my Church: yet still
in mine eyes, through my grace; upon this thy repentance, thou art beautiful,
like unto that neat and elegante City of ^irzah, and that orderly building of
Jerusalem, the glory of the world: and with this thy loveliness, thou art
awefull unto thine adversaries, through the power of thy censures, and the
majesty of him that dwells in thee.

Yea, such beauty is in thee, 4. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they
ouercom me: thine hair is like a flock of goats which look down from Gilead.
that I am overcome with the vehemency of my affection to thee: turn away
thine eyes a while from beholding me; for, the strength of that faith, whereby
they are fixed upon me, rauishes me from my self with joy. I do therefore
again renew thy former praise; that thy gracious profession, and all thy
appendances and ornaments of expedient ceremonies, are so comely to behold, as
it is to see a flock of wel-fed goats grasing upon the fruitful hills of
Gilead.

5. Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, which
every one bring out twins, and none is barren among them.
Thy Teachers, that chew and prepare the heavenly food for thy soul, are of
sweet accordance one with another, having all one heart, and one tongue; and
both themselves are sanctified and purged from their uncleannesses, and are
fruitful in their holy labors unto others: so that their doctrine is never in
vain, but is still answered with plentiful increase of souls to the
Church.

That part of thy countenance which thou will have seen (tho dimmely and
sparingly) is full of holy modesty and bashfulnesse; 6. Thy Temples are within
thy locks as a piece of a Pomgranate.
so blushing, that it seems like the color of a broaken piece of Pomgranate.

Let there be never so great a number of people and nations of Churches and
assemblyes, 7. There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and of
the da^sels, without number.
which challenge my name and love, and perhaps by their outward prosperity
may seem to plead much interest in me, and much worth in themselves:

Yet thou only art alone my true and chaste Spouse, 8. But my Love is alone,
and my undefiled, she is the only daughter of her mother, and she is dear to
her that bare her: the daughters have seen her, and counted her blessed, even
the queens and the co^cubines and they have praised her.
pure and undefiled in the truth of thy doctrine, and the imputation of my
holiness; thou art she, whom that Jerusalem which is above, (the mother of
us all) acknowledges for her only true, and dear daughter. And this is not
my commendation alone, but all those foreign assemblyes, which might seem to
be riualles with thee of this praise, do applaude and bless thee in this
thine estate, and say; Blessed is this people, whose God is the Lord.

9. Who is she that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, pure as
the sun, terrible as an army with banners.
And admiring thy goodlinesse shall say; Who is this that looks out so freshlie
as the morning nevve risen; which from these vveake beginnings is grown to
such hie perfection, that now she is as bright, and glorious, as the sun in
his full strength; and the moon in a clear sky; and vvithall is so
dreadefull thorough the majesty of her countenance, and power of her
censures, as some terrible army, with ensigns displayed, is to a vveake
adversary.

Thou complaynest of my absence, (O my Church): 10. I went down to the dressed
Orchard, to see the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine budded, and if the
Pomgranates flourished.
there was no cause; I meant not to forsake thee: I did but only walk
down into the vvell-dressed Orcharde of thine assemblyes, to recreate and joy
my self, with the view of their forvvardnesse: to see the happy progress of
the humble in spirit, and the gracious beginnings of those tender souls,
which are newly converted unto me.

11. I knew nothing, my soul set me as the charets of my noble people.
So earnestly did I long to reuisit thee, and to restore comfort unto thee; that
I hasted I knevve not which way: and with insensible speed, I am come
back, as it were upon the swiftest chariots, or the wings of the vvinde.

12. Return, return, o Shulamite: return, return, that I may behold thee: what
shall you see in the Shulamite, but as the company of an army?
Now therefore return (O my Spouse, the true daughter of Jerusalem) return to
me, return to thy self and to thy former feeling of my grace: return, that
both my self, and all the company of Angels, may see, and rejoice in thee: and
what shall ye see (O all ye host of heaven) what shall ye see in my Church?
even such an awful grace and majesty, as is in a wel-marshalled army, ready
to meet with the enemy.


CHAP. VII.
HOw beautiful are thy feet O daughter of the highest; 1. How beautiful are thy
goings with shoes, O princes daughter? the compass of thy hyps like jewels:
the work of the hand of a cunning workman.
being shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace, and readily addressed
to run the way of the commandments of thy God: thou art compassed about thy
loins with the girdle of verity; which is both precious for the matter of it,
and cunningly framed by the skill of the spirit of truth.

2. Thy navel is as a round cup, that wants not liquor: thy belly is as an
heap of wheat compassed about with Lillies.
The navel, whereby all thy spiritual conceptions receive their nourishment,
is full of all fruitful supply, and never wants means of sustenance, to feed
them in thy womb: which also is so plentious in thy blessed increase, that it
is as an heap of wheat, consisisting of infinite pure grayns which consort
together with much sweetness, and pleasure.

Thy two testaments (which are thy two full and comely breasts; 3. Thy two
breasts are as two young Kids that are twins.
by whose wholesome milk thou nourishest all thy faithful children, once
borne into the light) are for their excellent and perfect agreement, and their
amiable proportion, like two twins of Kids.

Those, 4. Thy neck is like a tower of Iuory: thine eyes are like artificial
pooles in a frequented gate: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon, that looks
toward Damascus.
who by their holy authority support thy government (which are as some straight
and strong neck to bear up thy head) are for their height and defense like a
tower; for their order, pureness, and dignity, like a tower of Iuory: thy
teachers and ministers (which are thine eyes) are like unto some clear and
artificial ponds of water, in a place of greatest resort: wherein all comers
may see the faces of their consciences; and whence they may plentifully draw
the waters of life. Thy nose, by which all spiritual sents are conuaied to
thee, is perfectly composed, and featured like some curious turret of that
goodly house in Lebanon; so as thy judgment, and power of discerning the
spirits, is admirable for the order and excellency thereof.

5. Thine head upon thee is as scarlet, and the bush of thine head like purple:
the king is tied in thy beams.
The whole tire of thine head (which are the ceremonies used by thee) are very
graceful, and of hie estimation and price to all the beholders: and as for me,
I am so enamoured of thee, that I am even tied by my own desire, to a
perpetual presence in thine holy assemblies.

Oh how beautiful and lovely art thou therefore (O my Church) in all thy parts
and ornaments? 6. How fair art thou and how pleasant art thou, O my love, in
pleasures?
how sweet and pleasant art thou (O my love) in whatsoever might give me true
contentment?

Thy whole frame is, 7. This thy stature is like a palm tree, and thy breasts
like clusters.
for goodliness and straight growth, like unto some tall palm tree; which the
more it is depressed by the violence of persecutions, rises the more; and the
two breasts of thy Testaments are like two full iuicie clusters, which yield
comfortable and abundant refreshing.

8. I said, I will go up into the Palm Tree. I will take hold of her boughs:
thy breasts shall now be like the clusters of the vines, and the savor of thy
nose like apples.
Seeing then thou art my Palm Tree, I have resolved in my self to adioyne my
self to thee; to enjoy thee, to gather those sweet fruits of thy graces, which
thou yeeldest; and by my presence also will cause thee to be more plentiful
in all good works, and doctrine; so as thou shall afford abundance of heavenly
liquor unto all the thirsty souls of thy children; and an acceptable verdure
of holiness and obedience unto me.

4. And the roof of thy mouth like good wine, which goes straight up to my
well-beloved; and causes the lips of him that is asleep, to speak.
And the delivery of my word, by the mouths of thy ministers, shall be as
some excellent wine, which sparkleth right upward: being well accepted of that
God, in whose name it is taught, and looks most pleasantly in the glass,
being no less highly esteemed of the receivers: which is of such wonderful
power, that it is able to put words both of repentance, and praise into the
lips of him, that lies asleep in his sins.


The Church. BEhold, such as I am, 11. I am my welbeloueds, and his desire is
toward me.
I am not my own; much less am I any others: I am wholely my Saviors; and
now I see, and feel, whatsoever I had deserved, that he is mine also, in all
entire affection; who has both chosen me, and given himself for me.

11. Come my wel-beloued, let us go into the fields let us lodge in the
villages.
Come therefore, O my dear Savior, let us join together in our natural care:
let thy spirit and my service be intent upon thy congregations here below on
earth; and let us stay in the place where our spiritual husbandry lies.

12. Let us go up early in the morning to the vines, and see if the vine
flourish, whether it has disclosed the first grapes, or whether the pomegranats
blossom: therewill I give thee my love.
Let us with all have and cheerfulness visit the fruitful vines of our
believing children; and to our mutual comfort, be witnesses and partakers of
all the signs and fruits of grace, of all those good works, and
thankesgiuings, of those holy endeavors and worthy practices, which they yield
forth unto us: let us judge of their forwardness, and commend it: whereupon it
will easily appear, that the consummation of our happy marriage draws
near, in which there shall be a perfect union betwixt us.

Behold: thy godly servants, 13. The mandrakes have given a smell, and in our
gates are all sweet things, new and old; my well-beloved, I have kept the^ for
thee.
which not only bear fruit themselves, but are powerful in the provocation
of others, present their best services unto thee; and even at our doors (not
far to seek, not hard to procure) is offer made unto thee, of all variety
of fruit; whether from thy young conuerts* or thy more settled professors: and
all these I spend not lauishlie; but, in my loving care, duly reserve them for
thee, and for the solemn day of our full marriage.


CHAP. VIII.
The Jewish Church. 1. Oh that thou werest as my brother that sucked the breast
of my mother. I would find thee without, I would kiss thee, then they should
not despise me.
OH that I might see thee (my Savior) clothed in flesh: Oh that thou which art
my everlasting husband, might also be my brother, in partaking the same
humane nature with me; that so I finding thee below upon earth, might
familiarly intertaine thee, and converse with thee, without the reproach of the
world; yea, might be exalted in thy glory.

Then would I (tho I be now pent up in the limits of Judea) bring thee forth
into the light, 2. I will lead thee, and bring thee into my mothers house;
there thou shall teach me: I will cause thee to drink spiced wine, and new
wine of the pomgranats.
and knowledge of the universal Church, whose daughter I am: and then and
there, thou should teach me how perfectly to serve and worship thee, and I
shall gladly intertaine thee with a royal feast of the best graces that are in
my holiest servants; which I know thou will account better cheer, the^ all
the spiced cups, and pomgranate wines in the world.

3. His left hand shall be under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.
Then shall I attain to a nearer communion with him; and both his hands shall
be employed to sustain, and relieve me: yea, he shall comfort my head and my
heart (my judgment, and affections) with the lively heat of his gracious
imbracements.

4. I charge you O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor waken my
love, until he please.
I charge you (O all ye that profess any friendship to me) I charge ye
deeply, as ye will avoid my uttermost censures; take heed how ye vex and
disquiet my merciful Savior, and grieve his spirit: and do not dare, by the
least provocation of him, to interrupt his peace.


CHRIST. WHo is this, 5. Who is this that comes out of the wilderness;
leaning upon her well-beloved? I raised thee up under an apple tree: there thy
mother conceived thee: there she conceived that bare thee.
that from the comfortless deserts of ignorance, of infidelity, of
tribulatio^s, ascends thus up into the glorious light and liberty of my
chosen? relying her self wholly upon her Savior, and solacing her self in
him? Is it not my Church? it is she, whom I have loved, and acknowledged of
old: for, even under the ^ree of offense, the forbidden fruit which thou
tastedst to thy destruction, I raised thee up again from death; Even there,
thy first mother conceived thee; while by faith she laid hold on that blessed
promise of the Gospel, whereby she, and her believing seed were restored.


Jewish Church. 6. Set me is a seal on thy heart, and as a signet on thine
arm: for love is strong as leath; Jealousy is cruel as the Grave: the coals
thereof are siery coals, and a vehement flame.
ANd so have thou me still (O my Savior) in a perpetual and dear remembrance:
keep me sure in thine heart, yea in thine arms, as that which thou hold
most precious; and let me never be removed from thy love; the least show and
danger whereof I cannot endure: for, this my spiritual love is exceeding
powerful, and can no more be resisted then death it self: and the ielous
zeal which I have for thee, and thy glory, consumes me, even like the Grave,
and burns me up like unto the coals of some most vehement and extreme fire.

Yea, more then any fire; 7. Much water cannot quench love, neither can the
floudes drown it: if a man should give all the substance of his house for
love, they would greatly contemn it.
for any flame yet may be quenched with water: but all the water of afflictions
and terrors (yea whole streams of persecutions) cannot quench this love: and
for all tempting offers of wealth, of pleasures and honor, how easily are they
all contemned for the love of my Savior?

We have yet a sister (as thou know O Savior) ordained through thy mercy to
the same grace with me: 8. We have a little sister, and she has no breasts:
what shall we do for our sister, when she shall be spoken for?
the uncalled Church of the Gentiles; small (as yet) of groth, through the
rareness of her conuerts, and destitute of the help of any outward ministry;
whereby she might either bear, or nourish children unto thee: when she grows
unto her maturitie; and the mystery of calling her universally to thee, shall
be revealed to the world, and her self; what course will it please thee to
take with her?


CHRIST. 9. If she be twall, we will build upon her a silver palace: and if she
be a door, we will keep her in with boards of cedar.
IF she shall continue firm and constant, in the expectation of her promises,
and the profession of that truth which shall be revealed; we will beautify
and strengthen her, with further grace, and make her a pure and costly palace,
fit to entertain my spirit: and if she will give free passage and good
entrance, to my word and grace; we will make her sure and safe from
corruption, and reserve her to immortality.


Jewish Church. BEhoulde: 10. I am a wall, and my breasts are as towers: then
was I in his eyes as one that finds peace.
that condition which thou requirest in the Church of the Gentiles, thou
find in me; I am thus firm and constant in my expectation, in my
profession: and that want thou find in her of ability to nourish her
Children, by the breast of thy WORD, is not in me; who have abundance both of
nourishment and defense: upon which my confession and plea, I found grace and
peace in the eyes of my Savior; and received from him assurance of his
everlasting love to me.


CHRIST. 11. Solomon had a vine in Baalhamon: he gave the vineyard unto
keepers: every one brings for the fruit thereof a thousand pieces of silver.
MY Church is my Vine, and I am the owner, and husbandman: our thrift and profit
thereof far exceeds the good husbandry of Solomon: he has a rich vineyard
indeed in a most fruitful soil; but he lets it forth to the hands of others,
as not being able to keep and dress it himself: and therefore he is feign
to be content with the greatest part of the increase, not expecting the whole.

But my vine is ever before me, 12. But my vineyard which is mine is before
me: to thee o Solomon appertains a thousand pieces of silver, and two
hundredth to them that kept the fruit thereof.
I am with it to the end of the world, I reserve it in mine own hands, and
dress it with mine own labor: and therefore if thou (O Solomon) can receive
from thine, to the proportion of a thousand, thy workmen and farmers will
look for the fifth part to come unto their share; whereas the gain of my
vineyard arises wholly, and only, unto my self.

Since therefore such is my care of thee, 13. O thou that dwell in the
garde^s, the companions hearken unto thy voice, cause me to hear it.
and joy in thee (O my Church; which co^sistest of the particular assemblies of
men professing my name) see thou be diligent in declaring my will, and giving
holy counselles to all thy fellow members: speak forth my praise in the great
congregations, (which al attend willingly upon thee) and let me hear the voice
of thy constant and faithful confession of me before the world.


The Church. 14. Oh my well-beloved, flee away, and be like unto the Roe, or to
the young Heart upon the mountains of spices.
I Will most gladly do what thou commaundest, O my Savior but, that I may
perform it accordingly; be thou (which art, according to thy bodily presence,
in the highest heavens) ever present with me by thy spirit, and hasten thy
glorious coming, to my full redemption.
