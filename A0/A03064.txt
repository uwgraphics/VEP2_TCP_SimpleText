THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
GLorious things are spoken of the grace of graces Faith in the Scriptures,
God setting himself to honor that grace that yields up all the honor unto
him in Christ; who indeed is the life of our life, and the soul of our soul.
Faith only as the bond of union brings Christ and the soul together, and is
as an artery that conueyes the spirit from him as the heart; and as the
sinnewes which convey the spirit to move to all duty from him as head, whence
Saint Paul makes Christ's living in us, and our living by faith all one, Gal.
2.20. Now that which gives boldness and liberty to faith, is not only Gods
assignement of this office to it in the covenant of grace to come unto Christ,
and unto him in Christ to receive grace, but likewise the gracious promises
whereby the great God has engaged himself as a debtour to his poor creature,
for all things needful to life and godliness, until that blessed time when
we shall be put into full possession of all things we have now only in
promise; when faith shall end in fruition, and promises in performance. Faith
first looks ^o this word of promise, and in the promise to Christ, in whom and
for whom, they are yea and Amen, both made and performed. And in Christ it
eyeth God in whom it last rests, is its proper center and foundation,
otherwise how should we weak sinful creatures dare to have any intercourse
with God that dwells in that light that none can attain unto, if he had not
come forth and discovered his good pleasure in Christ the substantial Word,
and in the word inspired by the Holy Ghost for the good of those whom God meant
for to make heirs of salvation. Now these promises whereon all our present
comfort and future hope depends, lie hid in the Scriptures, as veins of gold
and silver in the bowels of the earth, and had need be laid open, that Gods
people may know what upon good grounds to lay claim unto. Those therefore that
search these mines to bring to light these treasures deserve well of Gods
Church. We commend, (and not without cause) the witty industry of those that
from Springs remote bring Rivers to Cities, and by Pipes from those Rivers
derive water to every man's house for all domestical services: much more should
we esteem of the religious pains of men that bring these waters of life home
for every man his particular use, in all the passages and turnings of this
life. In which regard, I do not doubt, but the pains of this godly, painful,
and learned man will find good entertainment of all children of the promises
that hope to inherit them, who has with great pains, and with good evidence
of spiritual understanding, endeavored to clear most matters concerning
faith; and likewise discovered the variety and use of the promises with
teaching Christians how to improve their riches in Christ here spread before
them, how to use the shield of Faith, and the sword of the Spirit upon all
occasions, that so they might not only be believing but skillful Christians,
knowing how to manage and make the best advantage of their faith, and the word
of faith. Which if they could do, there would another manner of power and
beauty shine in their lives then does. He is a man that has formerly
deserved well of the Church, but in a more special manner fitted for a
Treatise of this nature, as having been put to it, to know by experience what
it is to live by faith, having in sight for matters of this life very little
whereupon to depend. Those that are driven to exercise their faith, cannot but
find God faithful, as never failing those that trust in him, they see more of
God then others do. If it be objected that others of late time have dug in
the same mine, and labored in the same field, and to good purpose and
success: I answer, it is true, the more this age is bound to God that directs
the spirits of men to so useful, so necessary an argument, seeing without
faith we have no communion with the fountain of life, nothing in this world
that can yield settled comfort to ground the soul upon, seeing without it the
fairest carriage is but empty and dead morality, neither finding acceptance
with God, nor yielding comfort to us in our greatest extremities, and by it God
himself, and Christ with all that he has done, suffered, conquered, becomes
ours and for our use. Besides none that I know have written in our Language so
largely of this argument, and such is the extent and spiritualnesse of this
heavenly point, that many men and of the greatest graces and parts may with
great benefit to the Church, diue and dig still into this mystery. Neither
let any except against the multitude of quotations of Scriptures, they are
brought under their proper head, and set in their proper place, and the matter
it self is cut out into variety of parts. Store (as we use to speak) is no
sore, we count it a delight to take out of a full heap, the more light, the
conviction is the stronger, what suits not at one time will suit our spirits
and occasions at another, and what takes not with one, may take with another.
But the full and well handling of matters in this Treatise carries such
satisfaction with it, that it frees me from necessity of further discourse,
and mine own present weakness of body takes me off. Only I was willing to
yield that testimony to the fruitful pains of a faithful labourer in Gods
Vineyard, that I judge it deservedly. Receive it therefore, Christian Reader,
with thanks to God that stirs up such helpers of that faith by which we
live, stand, conquer, and in which we must die, if we look to receive the end
of our faith, the salvation of our souls.

discursiue, p. 24. 25 Faith is an affiance or confidence,. 3. p. 25. 26. etc.

the faithful may fail, p. 70. 71 The obedience of faith is uniform, entire

one sin then another: but if right comparison be made, faith inciteth to
hate all sin, one as well as another, p. 72. 73
CHAP. VI.
THe special object of justifying faith are the free promises of mercy and
forgiveness in Jesus Christ,. 1 p. 73. 74 Abraham believing the promise of
seed, did apprehend that blessed seed, which from the beginning had been
promised, p. 74 Remission of sins does presuppose the mercy of God, p. 74

faith embraces to salvation, p. 77. 78. 79 Faith in Gods special mercy
frames his Image in the Heart,. 3. p. 81. 82

IVstifying faith is a particular and certain confidence,. 1. p. 82. 83 The
thirsty and burdened soul is invited to come unto Christ, and commanded to
believe: p. 83. 84 Justifying faith is opposed to despair, so as to expel it:
it breeds confidence and boldness: and receives Christ for the conueying of
his benefits particularly unto us, p. 84. 85. Faith is certain in the event,
not ever in sense,. 2 p. 85. 86 Things are to us according as we conceive
them, which is not ever answerable to the evidence of the thing in it self, or
to the certainty in regard of event, p. 86. 87 A Belieuer, who has a sure

justifies is a resting upon Christ to obtain pardon, not an assured

faith as the instrument thereof,. 4 p. 92
CHAP. VIII.
HOw faith assures of salvation,. 1. p. 94. 95 This assurance is such as is

of remission of sins, is not equal in certain and firmness of assent, to
that assurance which we have about the common object of faith,. 3. p. 96. 97

temptations,. 4. 98. 99 Belief in Christ for remission is stronger and more

much, that my particular person beholding the Son, and believing on him,
shall have eternal life, p. 101. 102. 103 Such as truly believe may know they

belieuer is infallible in it self and in event, but not ever in his
apprehension and feeling,. 9 p. 113. Assurance of faith in things
extraordinarily is not altogether free from assaults, p. 114 The benefits that
come unto us by temptations, p. 115. 116 The Commandments are laid before

walk in unto eternal life,. 10. p. 117 Upright walking is necessary, but not
the cause of Justification, p. 118 The belieuer relyeth not upon his works,
though he exercise himself therein with all diligence, p. 119 What

THe authority of the Church cannot be the ground of faith,. 1. p. 128. 129
Whatsoever credit the Church has, it receives the same from the Scriptures,

rests not upon the Saints, but upon Jesus Christ,. 3. p. 132. 133 The
Rhemists in defense of their Saint-inuocation, are driven to say, that we are
to trust in the Saints departed, p. 133. 134. 135

justifying faith,. 2. p. 140 Faith is proper unto Man in this life, in his
journey toward his perfect home and eternal habitation, p. 141 All men have

obtained through Christ only. ibid. And received and possessed by faith, and by
it alone. p. 217 218 This promise is of faith, 1. That it might be of free
grace, ibid. 2. That it might be steadfast and sure to all the seed ibid. 3.
That only is the true manner of Justification, which shuts forth all boasting
in the dignity of our works. p. 218. 219
Its necessary to seek pardon of sin by faith, for 1. In our selves we be
sinful and cursed, and remission which is of grace, can be obtained by no
other means, but only by faith in Jesus Christ, p. 219 2. Faith goes directly
unto Christ, that by him we might be justified. ibid. 3. Faith in the promises
of mercy, does commend and maintain the glory of Gods grace. p. 220
The acts of faith touching this promise of forgiveness be diverse. 1. It
generally belieueth the promise to be true, and thereby discernes that sin
is pardonable. p. 220. 221 2. It stirs up earnest desires and longings to
be made partaker of this mercy. p. 221. 222 3. It draws us forward to seek
mercy of God by unfeigned confession and hearty supplication. p. 222. 223. 224
4. It embraces and rests upon the special and free mercy of God in Christ
for pardon. p. 224. 225 5. It does certify of pardon granted and sealed unto
us. p. 225 How faith does assure that our sins are already pardoned. p. 225.
226 Three prerogatives accompany confident assurance. 1. Peace with God. 2.
Free access unto the throne of grace. 3. Joy in the Holy Ghost unspeakable and
glorious. p. 227. 228
6. By faith we continue in this blessed state, in sweet peace and fellowship
with God. p. 228. 229

A Christian may live by faith for many days, or rather all the days of his
life, in sweet peace and communion with God if he will learn to maintain, and
take pains to exercise his faith aright. p. 230. 231. 232 To what measure of
joy a Christian may attain. p. 232. 233 Two special causes there be, why many
good Christians live so long in fear and doubt. 1. An immoderate aggrauation
of their sin, and continual thought of their unworthiness. p. 234
These must know it is good to deny themselves; but not to doubt of the mercy
of the Lord. ibid. The detestation of sin is greatly to be commended, if they
remember withal, that there is hope in Israel concerning this. p. 235 There be
sins of ignorance, infirmity, forgetfulness and sudden passion: and there be
foul, enormous, notorious sins, which wound conscience. p. 235. 236 If a man
have often fallen into notorious offenses, he is not to despair. ibid. A foul
offense after grace received is not unpardonable. p. 236. 237 Many complain
they cannot believe, when indeed they think there is no promise of mercy made
unto them, upon which they should ground their confidence. ibid. Such must
know, 1. that God calls them in his word to come unto him, as if he did
particularly name them. 2. They must consider of the free grace of God in
promising, and his faithfulness in making good whatsoever he bath promised.
ibid.
The second cause is, ignorance of the way how this assurance is to be sought,
upon what foundation it is to be laid, in what order they come unto it. p. 238
Two things are specially to be learned for their direction. 1. That as soon as
ever a man feels sin as a burden, and does truly thirst to be eased of it,
he has a calling to come unto Christ. p. 238 2. The barren in grace must come
unto Christ to be supplied of his fullness. p. 239
Directions to the weak, how to stir up themselves to believe, when they
feel no comfort. p. 239 1. They must unfeignedly humble their souls before God
in the confession of sin, with earnest prayer for pardon. p. 240 2. They must
rowse and stir up themselves to believe, with reasons drawn from the
promises and covenant of God made in Jesus Christ, considerations taken out of
the word, and experience of his dealing with other his servants in former
times. p. 241. 242 3. They must be instant with the Lord to give them both
strength of faith, and the sight of their belief. p. 242. 243 4. They must
comfort their hearts in the certainty of Gods word, though for the present they
feel no comfort. p. 243
Thus faith is daily to be preserved and quickened. ibid.
CHAP. III.
OF the promises of Sanctification. p. 244 A Christian is allowed to believe
these promises, for 1. In the covenant of grace God has promised to take away
the heart of stone, etc. p. 245 2. The fountain of grace is set open unto the
thirsty, and he is invited to come and drink, to the satisfying of his soul.
p. 245. 246 3. Christ by his blood has purchased for his people all spiritual
blessings in heavenly things. ibid. 4. We are taught to ask of God in Christ,
increase and strength of grace. ibid. 5. The faithful have relied upon Christ
for grace and ability to walk in his ways. ibid. 6. Man's duty is Gods free
gift of grace. ibid.
It is necessary to believe, that God will sanctify our nature, and enable to
the duties of holiness. p. 246. 247 For, 1. Justification and sanctification
be individual. p. 247 2. Otherwise Christians shall very much stagger, be off
and on, coldly set upon the practice of Christianity. ibid. 3. Our own
strength is too weak for the work of holiness. ibid. 4. Setlednesse in this
that God will perfect the work of holiness begun, causes men to go about
the work of mortification with much readiness. ibid. 5. The promises of God
concerning spiritual things are linked together. p. 248
The acts of faith about the promises of sanctification. 1. It acquaints a man
with his emptiness of grace, and the strength of his inbred corruption. p.
248. 249 2. It shows where the strength is to be had which we want, and
stirs up to a constant, conscionable and diligent use of the means of grace.
p. 249. 250 3. It inciteth to an holy improuement of what grace we have
received. ibid. 4. It fights courageously against sin, and cries instantly
to the Lord for help. ibid. 5. It submits willingly to what course the Lord
is pleased to take for the crucifying of sin. ibid. 6. Faith is the band or
sinew whereby we are tied unto Christ the fountain of grace. p. 251. 252 7.
True faith stirs up to thankfulness for the beginning of sanctification.
p. 252
The means how a Christian is to stir up faith to believe that God will
sanctify him, when he sees nothing but thraldom. 1. He must bewail his
spiritual nakedness, thraldom and vassalage under sin. p. 252. 253 2. He
must look to the grace, truth and power of God, who has promised to
sanctify: to the fullness and sufficiency that is in Christ the fountain of
grace. p. 254 3. He must pray instantly unto the Lord for sanctifying grace. p.
255 4. It is good to move the heart quietly to rest in the promise, and rejoice
in hope. p. 255

CHAP. IIII.
CHrist has purchased for us life everlasting no less then righteousness. p,
256 Eternal life is promised upon condition of faith in Christ. p. 256 Life
eternal is begun in them that believe. p. 257 When first we believe them are
we entitled to life everlasting, and so have the accomplishment of glory in
respect of right and propriety. p. 257. 258 It is our duty to believe in God
through Jesus Christ for the obtaining of eternal life to be given of grace.
ibid. It is very necessary to believe it. 1. That we might with more quietness
of Mind bear the afflictions, troubles and persecutions, which befall us in
this world. p. 258 2. It serves to establish our hearts against sundry worldly
cares and fears. p. 259 3. If we keep Heaven in our eye, we shall fight
courageously, and run with patience, notwithstanding all opposition. ibid.
The acts of faith concerning these promises. 1. As an humble petitioner it
receives and lays hold upon salvation it self promised. p. 259. 260 2.
Faith does not begin to apprehend life, and then leave it to works: but does
ever rest upon the promise, until we come to enjoy it. p. 260 3. By faith we
receive the promised Spirit, as the earnest of our inheritance. p. 260. 261 4.
Faith in the promises of everlasting life leads forward in the paths of peace
and righteousness, p. 261. 262 5. It seeks to get our title confirmed and
assured to the conscience by evidence, and earnest, or pawn. p. 263 6. It
strives to enter the possession of this heavenly kingdom by degrees. p. 263
7. It earnestly desires and longs after the full accomplishment of glory. p.
263. 264 8. It assures that we are made heirs of glory, to which God of his
grace will bring us in his time appointed. p. 264. 265
God in great mercy does vouchsafe to his adopted sons many excellent
royalties in this life. p. 265. 266 The act of faith that arise from the
privileges of the godly in this life. 1. Faith rests upon the grace of God
to receive from him whatsoever may be good and profitable. p. 266. 267 2. It
petitioneth instantly for succor. p. 267. 268 3. It receives earthly
blessings as gifts of the covenant, and tokens of love. p. 268 4. Faith in
these and the foresaid promises does greatly enlarge the heart toward God.
ibid. 5. It does inwardly quiet and cheer the heart in the midst of manifold
outward discouragements. p. 268. 269
The way and means to stir up faith in these promises. 1. To humble our
selves unfeignedly in respect of our miserable and accursed estate by sin, and
former carelessness to seek mercy, etc. p. 269. 270. 271. 272 2. We must
incite and stir up our selves to receive the promises of everlasting life, by
consideration of the free and rich grace of God, his truth and faithfulness;
the sufficiency of Christ's merits; and greatness, excellency and worth of the
benefit promised. p. 272. 273. 274. 275. 276 3. We must pray earnestly that God
would increase our faith, seal us by his Spirit, lead us in the way of peace,
cause us to grow up in holiness, make us wise to prize and value, to taste and
relish the joys of Heaven, and assure our consciences of right and title to
that everlasting inheritance. p. 277. 278 4. We must quicken our selves to
rejoice in God, wait patiently, and walk chearefully before him. p. 278. 279

CHAP. V.
GOd has made many promises of perseverance. p. 279 280 The love which God
bears to his people is an everlasting love, and the covenant which he has
made with them effectually, and shall be kept assuredly, is an everlasting
covenant. p. 280. 281 The condition of the covenant is promised in the covenant
it self. p. 281. 282 All the faithful are built upon the rock, not upon the
rock now, and anon upon the sand. p. 282 The sheep of Christ shall never
perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of his hand. p. 282. 283 They are
fenced against the treachery of their own hearts remaining in them. p. 283 The
holy Spirit is sent into their hearts to dwell and remain with them, as an
earnest of their inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased
possession. p. 283. 284 The life which they live by faith in Christ, is an
everlasting life. p. 284 Christ has prayed for his people, that their faith
should not fail. p. 284 We are assured from God, that he will perfect the
work of grace which he has begun. ibid. By serious meditation on these
promises we must settle our selves in believing our perseverance: which is very
necessary. For, 1. Had it not been a point of great weight, the Lord would not
have mentioned it so often. p. 285 2. We are weak and feeble to withstand, our
spi^ituall enemies potent and vigilant to assail. ibid. 3. Our weakness is
not greater then our backwardness to believe the promises of perseverance,
when we stand in most need. ibid. 4. Whilst Christians distrustfully question
their perseverance, all present favors seem the less all other promises be
held the more weakly. ibid. 5. Confidence in the promises of perseverance does
encourage and quicken in a Christian course. p. 286
He that has faith indeed will not; nay, he cannot take courage to go on in
sin upon this pretense, that faith once had, cannot utterly be lost. ibid. 6.
Look how much we come short in believing the faithful promises of God,
concerning our future protection from all hurtful evils, so much are we
lacking to sound peace and stable tranquillity of Mind and Conscience. p. 287.
288
The godly are allowed to believe their perseverance. For 1. God has confirmed
it by promise and covenant unto his children. p. 288 2. They have allowance to
believe the obtaining of that which Christ has prayed for, and they ask of
God in the Name of Christ according to his will. p. 289 3. What one believed
upon ordinary and common grounds, that is the privilege of all belieuers.
ibid. 4. It is a great glory to God, that we live by faith on him concerning
our future estate. p. 289. 290
The acts of faith concerning perseverance. 1. It makes a man sensible of his
own frailty. p. 290 2. It stirs up holy jealousy and suspicion, least we
should cool, decay, start aside or fall back. ibid. 3. Faith instantly cries

life and fervor. p. 292. 293 6. It coueteth increase of grace and
sanctification. p. 293. 294 7. It receives new supply of grace continually
from Jesus Christ the fountain of grace. ibid. 8. It assures of perseverance
through the promises of grace. p. 294. 295
Means to stir up our selves to believe these promises of perseverance. 1.
We must heartily bewail our pronenesse to sin, aptness to decline,
inabilitie to withstand any one temptation, or set one step forward in the way
to Heaven. p. 295. 296 2. We must stir up our selves to rest upon God
through Jesus Christ, for establishment and confirmation. p. 296. 297 3. We
must pray instantly that God would uphold us, and make us to see that he will
establish us unto the end. p. 297. 298

CHAP. VI.
THe servants of Christ are all soldiers, and have continual war not with
flesh and blood, but with principalities, and powers, and spiritual
wickednesses. p. 299 Encouragements to resist Satan. ibid. Promises of victory.
p. 299. 300 In this state of temptation the godly are allowed to believe the
promises of victory. For 1. The God of peace has promised to tread Satan under
our feet shortly. p. 300 2. Faith does glorify God, and is most profitable
unto us; our treasure, strength and victory. ibid. 3. We have a charge to
resist the Devil strong in the faith. p. 301 4. Faith is one of the first
things that is formed in a Christian, and wherewith God furnishes him, when
he prepares and calls him forth to the encounter. ibid. 5. The faithful
cannot better provide for their own ease and safety, then confidently to hope
in the Lord. p. 302
It is necessary a Christian should live by faith in this condition. For 1.
True valor cannot be had without faith in Christ, p. 302 2. All our strength
lies in Christ, whose Almighty power subdueth all things for us. p. 302. 303
3. Faith is of force to keep us against all assaults of the Devil. ibid. 4.
The Devil will renew his assaults, and we must renew our courage and
strength. ibid.
The acts of faith in respect of these promises of victory in temptation. 1.
Faith makes sensible that we cannot resist of our selves: but assures that
Satan is chained up by the power of Almighty God. p. 303. 304 2. It discovers
the Methods of Satan and his Ends in tempting. p. 304. 305 3. It lifts up the
heart to cry and complain unto God of the cruelty and malice of that
Spiritual Adversary, but suffers it not to muse upon his blasphemous
temptations. ibid. 4. By faith the poor soul eying the promise, betakes it
self unto the Lord for succor promised. p. 305. 306 5. It stirs up courage
and resolution to set upon the practice of godliness, and the duties of our
particular calling, as the means sanctified of God to procure freedom. p.
306. 307 6. It fortifieth the soul against all invasions. ibid. 7. Faith is
vigilant and watchful at all times, in all places upon all occasions. p. 307.
308 8. In the most forcible tempests which the enemy rayseth against us, faith
tells the heart that a calm is at hand. p. 308. 309 9. If Satan renew his
assaults faith stands prepared through the power of God to make resistance
afresh. p. 309 10. Faith assures, that by the ouer-ruling providence of God,
temptations serve for the increase of grace. p. 310
The godly are sometimes brought so low, that they can discern no spark of
faith, no fruit of grace, no mark of Gods love in themselves. For, 1. An
afflicted spirit tossed with fear and terror, cannot conceive or give notice
of it true estate. p. 310 2. Good men in temptation are pettishly disposed. p.
311
The Remedy in this distress is, 1. Grace may appear unto others, when in
temptation a godly man cannot discern it in himself. p. 310 2. It is the
wisdom of a Christian in this case to observe the mark that Satan drives at,
which is to hide from his fight the graces of the Spirit, that he might bring
him to despair: and so stir up himself to believe. For, 1. When he can see
no grace in his soul, he cannot but see himself to be miserable, and so
called to come unto Christ. ibid. 2. Taking courage to believe, he disappoints
Satan. ibid. 3. We have a commandment to believe as well as to prove our
selves, both which must be complete together. ibid. 4. If thou can not find
in thy self what thou seek after, come unto Jesus Christ, and believe in
him, that thou may receive what thou seek. p. 312 3. The distressed soul
must learn, that the grace of God works not always alike in his children.
p. 312 4. The long and manifold temptations of Satan, wherewith he seeks to
throw Christians headlong into despair, is to them a testimony of the
inhabitation of the Spirit in their hearts. p. 312. 313

Means to stir up faith in these perplexities and times of grievous
temptations. 1. The distressed Christian must unfeignedly humble his soul for
former ignorance, vanity of mind, disesteeme of mercy, timorousnes, discontent,
unbelief, etc. p. 313. 314 2. He must complain of the malice of Satan; and
instantly entreat the Lord to pardon sin, bridle, restrain, and tread
Satan under foot. p. 314. 315 3. He must cease to muse on the temptations of
Satan, and stir up himself courageously, valiantly to trust in the mercies
of the Lord, and rely upon his grace. p. 316 317 4. He must exercise himself
in well-doing, harbor holy and heavenly Meditations, nourish the motions of
Gods Spirit, etc. p. 317. 318. 319
If the distressed Christian have wasted his spirits with violent and
continual sorrow, he must be admonished, not to think that presently he
should recover former liveliness and ability. p. 319. 320
CHAP. VII.
AFflictions are not more ordinary, then heavy and burdensome to be borne. p.
320 We stand in need to be helped against discouragements in affliction.
ibid. God corrects 1. In great wisdom. p. 321 2. Measure. ibid. 3. For a
moment. p. 321. 322 4. In love and tenderness. ibid.
And that 1. to prove. 2. To purge. 3. To refine. 4. To confirm grace. p. 322.
323 He will deliver the righteous out of trouble. p. 323 Is tender over them in
trouble. p. 323. 324 And present for their help. p. 324. 325 It is most
necessary that we learn to live by faith in afflictions. p. 326 For 1. Faith
is the ground of silent and quiet expectation of salvation. ibid. 2. Faith in
God is the only stay and support of the heart in trouble and affliction. p.
326. 327 3. Faith is the shield of the soul, whereby it is defended against
all the fiery darts of the Devil. ibid. 4. Faith only supplies all our wants
in affliction. page 326. 327 5. Afflictions profit not, if they be not mixed
with faith in them that bear them. ibid.
The godly are allowed to live by faith in afflictions. For 1. Godliness has
the promise of this life, and that which is to come. p. 327 2. The godly have
had this confidence in former times, whose practice is both a token of our
privilege, and pattern of our duty. p. 328 3. God is hereby much glorified,
that we rely upon him as our rock of defense. ibid. 4. The Lord commands
us to wait upon him in times of trouble. ibid. 5. Confidence in God does the
more bind him, as it were, to do us good. p. 328. 329
The acts of faith in respect of these promises. 1. It looks unto God, and
acknowledges his hand in all afflictions, whosoever be the instruments. p.
329. 330 2. It teaches that we are in such distresses out of which none can
help us, but the strong helper of Israel. p. 330
This draws the heart from carnal repose in means or friends, and expels
vexations and distracting cares. ibid. 3. It wisely directs us to consider,
that the cause of all misery and sorrow is sin. p. 330. 331 4. Faith
meekeneth the heart willingly to submit it self to the good pleasure of God,
and patiently to bear his correction. p. 331
Faith comfort the conscience, and curbeth unbridled passions. ibid. The
considerations, whereby faith persuades unto meekness, be many, strong and
irresistible. As, 1. The desert of sin, which is far greater then any thing
we suffer. p. 332 2. The hand that lays the rod upon our back, viz. God our
most wise, just, gracious and loving Father. ibid. 3. That this Cup, how bitter
and wringing soever, is a medicine to cure, not a poison to destroy; ministered
in great love and tender compassion to drive out corruption, confirm faith,
preserve from falling, strengthen grace, weane from the world, and bring nearer
unto God. p. 332. 333. 334 4. After serious humiliation faith brings tidings,
that God will look down from Heaven in mercy, and send help in fittest
season. p. 335 5. Faith does re-minde us of our conformity with Christ in
afflictions, and of his partnership with us therein. p. 335. 336 6. Faith
sets before us the infinite recompense of reward. ibid.
The first act of faith, It teaches wisdom to judge aright of all
afflictions. p. 335. 336. 337 6. True and unfeigned confidence will not keep
silence in the ears of the Lord, nor cease to importune his aid, etc. p. 337.
338 7. It rayseth the heart, being conscious of it weakness, to rest upon the
Lord for strength, who makes us able to do all things through his
strengthening of us. page 338. 339. 340 8. By faith the godly heart is drawn
to use all means of help, that God in his providence does afford, but rests
quietly upon Gods promises, and assurance of his presence above all likelihoods
and appearances. p. 340. 341
This manner of dependence on the promises which faith works, is absolute
without limitation of time, measure of affliction, or manner of deliverance. p.
341. 342 What faith turns it self to meditate upon for support in this case.
p. 342. 343 9. Faith belieueth one contrary in another, and out of the deepest
distresses gathers assurance of sweetest deliverances. p. 343. 344 10. It
rejoices in tribulations, and triumphs before the victory. p. 345
We must live by faith in the heauiest afflictions, and of longest continuance.
p. 345. 346 The acts of faith in this case. 1. It teaches that many and strong
afflictions of long continuance are no more then necessary. p. 346. 347 2.
Faith in the greatest extremities suggesteth, that we are under the hand of
God, who corrects in measure, and for our profit; who has determined the
time and weight of our afflictions, and by his blessing will turn them to our
good. p. 347. 348 3. Faith sets a man about this work, that is seriously to
make inquiry into his heart and ways, deeply to humble himself before God,
and fervently to entreat mercy for sin past, wisdom to make use of present
misery, and favor to be set free. p. 349. 350 4. Faith raises the heart to
expect abundance of mercy from God, and through prayer and supply of the
Spirit to reap profit and taste comfort answerable to the sorrows it has
felt and endured. p. 350. 351
Living by faith in times of trial and visitation, does fit and p^epare the
heart to thankfulness when light shall shine from on high: and that so much
the more, as our afflictions have been the sharper. p. 351 In affliction faith
seems to be most weak, and corruption most stirring. 1. Many doubtful
thoughts ascend in Christians hearts, partly because they know not that they
are allowed to live by faith in an afflicted state, partly, because they judge
amiss of their afflictions. p. 351. 352 2. Gods physic, whilst it is driving
out corruption, makes us feel and complain of it more then ever. p. 352 3. In
afflictions faith is tried, the sweetness of it is not so much felt. ibid. 4.
It is the office of faith to receive the potion, and further the kindly working
of it, which cannot be done, unless it stir up godly sorrow, and wrestle
painfully to drive out corruption. p. 352. 353
Helps to stir up faith in deep afflictions when all means fail. 1. We
must lay open our sorrows before the Lord, and power out our complaint before
him. page 353. 354 2. Confess our sins with hatred and godly sorrow ibid. 3.
Take up our hearts for halting through unbelief, and call upon them to rest in
the promise of divine aid, assistance and deliverance. 354. 355 4. Importune
the Lord, and direct our supplications before him. p. 355. 356 5. Quicken our
resolution to trust in the Lord at all times, even when all refuge fails. p.
356

CHAP. VIII.
GOd has made many promises of earthly blessings. p. 357 In special the Lord
promises length of days, health, strength, wealth, favor, peace, joy, good
success, safety, good Name: and all these not only to the righteous
themselves, but to their children and posterity. page 358 359. 360 It is
necessary to believe these promises, for, 1. Faith in these promises does kill
covetous desires, distrustful and distracting cares. p. 360. 361 2. He will
never renounce carnal supports, who makes not God the stay of his soul for
outward things. ibid. 3. Belief in God brings good success. ibid. 4. If we
cleave not to the promises of God made concerning temporal things, we shall
adhere to the promises of life with less assurance. p. 361. 362 5. Faith
sweetneth and sanctifies, unto us the use of all outward comforts under our
hands. p. 362
The godly are allowed to live by faith touching these promises. For, 1. Se^ing
God has given Christ for us, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
things. p. 362. 363 2. The Lord by covenant has promised to furnish his people
with all needful blessings pertaining to this life. p. 363 3. God is our
faithful Creator, we the work of his hands: He is our Shepherd, we the
flock of his pasture: He is our Father, we his children. p. 364. 365 4. The
patient expectation of the Saints has confirmed this, that God will not be
wanting to his children in things of this life. p. 365. 366
The acts of faith in respect of these promises. 1. It preserves from the use
of all unlawful means, knowing that nothing can prosper which God approves
not. p. 366. 367 2. Faith is painful, provident and frugall. p. 367 3. It
makes inquiry into the heart, turns from evil, and seeks the face of the
Lord earnestly. ibid. 4. It stirs up to pray without distrustful,
fruitl^sse, excessive care, etc. p. 368 5. It sees riches in God, submits
to his wisdom, rests in his love, and so maintains a Christian in some
measure of contentation. p. 368. 369 6. In prosperity it keeps the heart in
an holy temper and disposition; in humility and meekness, tenderness and

A TREATISE OF FAITH. The first Part.
CHAP. I.
Of the diverse acceptations of Faith.

IT is expedient and necessary that all Christians should acquaint themselves
with the doctrine of Faith:. 1. The necessity of Faith.
because the safety of all Christian Religion does depend upon the right
understanding of this matte: and Satan with his subtleties has ever
endeavored to obscure this doctrine by the mists of Sophismes, or to weaken it
some other ways, that he might rob God of his glory, and the Church of the
certainty of her salvation. And if the necessity of a thing known and
acknowledged stir up to enquire into it, and labor after it, this also may
provoke us to search and enquire what faith is. Heb. 11.6.
As if a man would see, he must open his eyes, and yet he is not by external
violence forced thereunto. Ioh. 3.16, 18, 36 Romans 3.28. 1. Cor. 1.^1.
Salvation is in the pleasure and power of God, which he dispenses according
to his own, not our will. But he accepts none as righteous to life, but them
that believe. 1. Cor. 5.6, 7.
in which we are absent from the Lord, does evidence the necessity of faith:
As a son that lives from the presence of his Father must believe his letters
and messengers sent unto him. Acts 15.9. Romans ^.28. Ephesians. 1.13, 14.
because they cannot be conceived without it: so in things divine faith is
requisite, without which we can never comprehend the mysteries of salvation.

. 2. Diverse acceptations of the word faith.
Math. 23.23. Romans 3.3. Gal. 5.22. Titus 2.10.
. 2. The word Faith in Scripture is taken diversely Romans 12.3. and 14.1.22.
or the measure thereof is to be understood, specially the sound knowledge of
Christian liberty in Jesus Christ. Acts 17.31.
preaches salvation to be no otherwise but by faith in Christ: and this is
called by Divines, Acts 6.7. and 13.8. Gal. 1.23. and 3.2.5. Gal. 3.23, 24.
faith which is believed. Believing God, John 5.46, 47. John 2.22, 23. Luke
24.25. Acts 26.27.
Believing on God, Believing on Christ, Believing the Prophets. Romans 1.8. Gal.
6.10. Acts 14.22. Math. 9 2. 1 Thessalonians. 1.3.


. 3. Faith signifying belief is used to note. 1. An ordinary knowledge and
bare assent to the historical truth of Scripture, grounded upon the authority
and truth of the Speaker, though sometimes helped by experiments,. 3. Sorts of
Faith.
and other inducements, and probabilities of the things: and this is called
faith Historical, Historical faith.
that is, a naked, Iam. 2.19, 24. Acts 26.27.
imperfect, dead assent, without trust or confidence in the mercies of God, or
adherence to the Commandments. Howbeit we must not imagine, that faith is
reputed unsound, or not saluificall, because historical (rather it is
oftentimes Faith Miraculous.
which in respect of the object may be distinguished into Miraculous or
Ordinary. For the object of faith is, 1. Cor. 13.2. Matthew. 21.21. and 7.22.
either some special and singular promise, for the doing of some
extraordinary effect, wherein we trust by a miraculous active faith: Mark
9.23. Acts 14.9. Luke 17.19.
or it is some special promise for the obtaining of some spiritual or bodily
good thing after an extraordinary manner, whereon we trust by a miraculous
passive faith, as it is called: or else faith does respect the general and
common promises, which are made in the word of life, and made good to them that
believe, whereon we rest by faith ordinary. But faith Miraculous and Ordinary
are not diverse graces, but the same grace exercised about diverse objects. The
grounds of faith are different, Zanch. de redempt. lib. 1. c. 12. de prae. 1.
Sect. de Fide These. 2.
and so are the effects and adjuncts that flow from thence: but the grace it
self one and the same. As the Fathers believed special revelations and
extraordinary promises made to them, by the same ordinary faith, by which we
believe the common promises of salvation revealed in the Word: so the singular
promises of God made to some Belieuers concerning the working of miracles, were
embraced by the same faith, by which they did adhere to the general promises
of mercy, or were raised up to the doing of acts of love. For that faith which
does receive the more excellent promises (as are they concerning spiritual
life and salvation) can much more lay hold upon other promises of an inferior
nature, if they be made and certified unto us. Faith temporary.
That faith which is carried to the general promises, is either a confidence
vanishing, uncertain not-rooted, called faith Temporary: Mat. 13.20, 21. Luke
8.13, 14.
or an affiance certain, wel-planted, constant, known by the name of
Justifying or saving faith, Justifying faith
so called from the principal effect. For to justify is not the full effect
of this confidence or affiance, Luke 8.13. Matthew. 13.23.
beyond which the efficiencie of it does not extend: but because this is the
principal thing wherein the force of true faith is occupied, Acts 24.14. Acts
15.9. Psalm. 119.66. Acts 27.25. Gal. 5.6.
it is so called. Justifying faith belieueth the history, purifieth the heart,
sticks to the Commandments, receives the temporal promises, works by
love: but it is called Justifying from the principal effect; as the soul is
called reasonable from the power it has to invent, judge and discourse, not
that these are her only faculties. In the Scriptures of the New Testament this
faith is unfolded in these and such like phrases: To believe God; To believe in
or upon God: Romans 4.3. John 5.24. Acts 16.34. and 18.8. John 14.1. Romans 9.33.
Acts 6.42. Acts 16.31. John 2.11. and 3.16. Io. 1.12. and 3.33 Mark 1.15. Acts
11.1. and 2.41. 1. Cor. 2.14.
To believe in or upon Jesus Christ, To receive him, To receive the testimony
of God; To believe the Gospel, To receive the Word of God. To believe God
signifies no more but to assent to that which the Lord speaks: but believing,
as it belongs to the understanding is the root and foundation from which
confidence of the heart does spring and flow: such a belief in the mind is
signified in this and all other phrases, as is always necessarily accompanied
with trusting in God, for that which we believe he can and will bring to
pass. And the other of trusting to or relying upon is implied, whenever we
find that ascribed to believing, which cannot be obtained without faith in
Christ. And if we search the Scriptures, we shall find these phrases, To
believe Romans 4.3. with Romans 4.5, 24. Romans 10.10, 11. John 8.30, 31. Act. 19.4.
John 1.12. Acts 16.34. with 31. Mark 1.15. Genesis 15.6. with Rom 4.3.
God, and to believe in God, to import one and the same thing. A preposition
Exodus 14.31. and 19.9. Luke 24.25. John 2.23
is added to believe, when nothing but assent of mind is signified: and it is

. 4. Not the habit, but the act of faith is required.
. 4. But evermore when faith is required, it is not the faculty, whereby we
are apt, and furnished to believe, but the act and exercise of that habit,
whereby we execute the function of believing, which is to be understood. For
this is that which God commands in the Scriptures, not that our souls be
adorned with the habit of faith though that be necessary, but that we believe
in him. Believe in the Lord your God. Repent ye and believe the Gospel. 2.

to them that believe on his Name. Ye believe in God, believe also in me. John

heart, thou may. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, Romans 1.16.

saved. We are justified by faith, Gal. 2.16. Acts 13.39. and 10.4.
is all one with that, By him all that believe are justified from all things,
from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses. Whosoever believes
in him shall receive remission of sins. Romans 4.3.
Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness. And
therefore the Israelites are reprehended, that they believed not in the Lord:

A fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel.
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. None but
those belieuers are praised; Blessed is she that believed, Luke 1.45. John
20.29. Romans 9.33.
Because thou have seen me, thou have believed; blessed are they which have
not seen, and yet have believed. Whosoever belieueth on him, shall not be
ashamed.

CHAP. II.
Of the Author and worker of Faith Justifying.

. 1. IVstifying faith,. 1. What Justifying Faith is.
which not only belieueth God speaking in his Word, but mebraceth all divine
truth as containing the chief good of Man, as being the most perfect, does
necessarily require before it faith historical, and comprehend all other kinds
under it. It may be defined, a lively and obedientiall affiance or confidence,
whereby we rest upon Christ for salvation, receive the promises of grace
temporal and spiritual, stick to the Commandments as good both simply and
in comparison, and feed upon the word with savor and delight. More largely, It
is a wonderful and supernatural gift of grace, wrought by the Holy Ghost
through the Ministry of the Gospel in the heart of Man a sinner,
acknowledging and bewayling his offenses, whereby he does not only assent to
the whole truth of God, and is certainly persuaded that Jesus Christ is
appointed of God to be the author of salvation to them that believe in him,
and his Savior if he do believe: but does rely, cast and repose his soul
upon Christ his Savior, and by him upon God as a loving Father in him,
cleaving inseperably to the Word of truth as good both simply and in
comparison, and feeding upon it as the wholesome food of life.

. 2. God the Father,. 2. God is the author of faith.
in his Son Jesus Christ our Mediator by the Holy Ghost, is the Author and
worker of Faith. Ephesians. ^.8. P^^l. 1.29. Acts 18.27. John 6.44. James 1.17.
As salvation, so faith is the gift of God. It is through grace that men
believe. No man can come unto me, except the Father which has sent me, draw
him. Every good thing comes from the Father of lights: but faith is a gift
after a special manner, most free and profitable, coming from the grace of
the Donor, bestowed upon us, when we are every way unworthy. It is such a gift
as comes not from common bounty, such as God made show of in the creation: but
from a special favor, which he bears his in Christ Jesus. The Scripture is
clear and evident herein, and strong reasons may be deduced thence to prove
it. For of our selves we have no power to believe, or to prepare our selves
thereunto. There is no such soil in our hearts, whence such fruit should
spring. The means of grace, and the operation of the spirit accompayning it,
are free and voluntary. No man can believe, unless he be created and formed
anew: But regeneration is a free work of Gods grace and mercy. Heb. 12.2.
Faith is the work of God the Father in Jesus Christ. For as the natural head
does not only give sense and motion to all the members now conjoined, but does
send forth those bands, whereby they come to be coupled with it: so Christ
does not only give spiritual sense and motion to his members already united
unto him by faith, but he is the spring whence this sinew of faith does flow
and issue unto us. The Spirit of God is the principal worker of faith: and
hence we are said to receive the Spirit of faith, that is, the holy Ghost, in
and through this gift of faith, which he works and continues in us. 2. Cor.
4.13. Romans 15.13.
By faith we receive the Holy Ghost: and faith is the work of the Holy Ghost:
the action of the Holy Ghost creating faith in us, How we are said to receive
the holy Ghost by faith.
is before faith: But the beginning of faith, is the receiving of the Holy
Ghost, and faith being begun, the gifts of the spirit are more and more
increased by it. Ephesians. 1.13. Gal. 3.14.
Faith it self is a work of the spirit: but an augmentation of the graces of
the spirit is obtained by faith; and the more our faith dilateth it self, the
more plentifully do the graces of the spirit flow into us from Christ; John
1.16.
Of whose fullness we receive grace for grace. How the Spirit is obtained by
Prayer.
Faith does obtain the Holy Ghost by prayer: and prayer: is an act of grace
and of the Spirit, as faith is a work of the Spirit. Luke 11.13.
Before we can lift up our souls unto God, the holy Ghost must descend into
us, and lift us up: for we move not, but as we are moved. The Holy Ghost is
given to the Elect before they ask: but a greater measure of the Spirit is
obtained by Prayer.

. 3. Faith is not alike in all,. 3. Faith is imperfect, though a work of the
Spirit.
in none perfect though it be the work of the Spirit: for the Spirit works
faith not as a natural agent which puts forth it power to the uttermost,
and always produces like effects, if it be not hindered: but as a voluntary
agent, which puts not forth his power to the utmost, works according to
his pleasure in whom he will, and as he will, but not in all alike. The Spirit
works faith not by moral persuasion only inciting to believe, Faith is a
powerful work of God.
and leaving it to our free choice whether we will assent or no: but by his
powerful operation and omnipotent hand put forth for such a purpose, he
produces this gracious effect. There are no seeds of faith in our nature, out
of which by more outward teaching we may be brought to belief: for then should
faith be natural, as all other things are, which our nature can attain to
with outward helps. There is no spiritual life in us before the infusion of
grace, whereby we should be able to embrace the persuasions of the spirit: for
then we should live spiritually of our selves before we are quickened by
grace. If the Spirit of God do only move and persuade to believe, then God
does not make the belieuer to differ from the vnbelieuer, but the good use of
his own free will. It is of grace that man might believe, and so might he that
continues in infidelity, for he received equal aid, and was equally
persuaded and incited by the Spirit. But if the question be, why does the one
believe and not the other, it is not the Spirit here that makes the difference,
but the good use of man's free will: and so, that man is enabled to believe, it
should be of grace, but that he does believe, and so differ from other men,
this should be from himself. The same power that raised Christ from the dead,
is said to raise us up to believe. Ephesians. 1.19, 20. 1. Pet. 1.5. 2. Pet. 1.1,
2, 3.
If an hand or eye be wanting to a man from his birth, can any power restore
them, but the Almighty power of God, by which the body was at first framed and
fashioned? By what power then is this hand of faith created, which reaches to
heaven? this eye which does see the things within the veil, which concern our
peace? Io. 6.37. Acts 13.48. Phil. 1.29. Matthew. 11.26.
This further appears by the cause that moves the Lord to bestow faith upon
some, which is his free, eternal, unchangeable grace and love whereby he
loved them to be made heirs of salvation, before the foundation of the earth
was laid. For so far as God effectually wills and intends to work, so
far he puts forth his omnipotent power to accomplish. But God does intend
and effectually will to draw some unto him before other some.

. 4. How God produces Faith.
. 4. In producing faith, first God bestows upon man the gift of understanding
and spiritual wisdom, opening and illuminating the eyes of his mind, to know
the promise in Christ, and to judge and esteem those things revealed of God to
be the most undoubted and infallible truth. This understanding is requisite to
faith: for it is impossible for a man to believe that whereof he has no
knowledge or understanding. Out of question, faith is a most wise g^ft or grace
of Gods holy Spirit, making those that be endued therewith wise unto salvation:
which we shall easily discern, if we consider how great the subtletie of that
old Serpent the Devil is, as also the deceitfulness of sin, both which are
defeated by faith. This understanding is the gift of Gods grace: for as
reasonable understanding is beyond the compass of that knowledge which the
beasts have by k^nd: so is this understanding far beyond the reach of all
that wisdom left in corrupted nature. It is a work irresistible, for it is
wrought according to the purpose of the Lord, 2. Cor. 4.6. 2. Tim. 1.9. Dan.
11.36.
and the counsel of God cannot be frustrated. In illumination the mind
suffers not from any natural power which it has to conceive or understand
spiritual things, but from that state of obedience that the mind stands in
unto Almighty God, whereby it must necessarily see whatsoever he will
enlighten it to behold, and set before it. There is no natural power in an eye
now blind to receive sight: but if God will enlighten it must needs see: So
there is no natural power in the eye of the mind now become darkness, to
receive the light of saving knowledge, which is every way a thing both for
matter and manner supernatural unto it: but if he open the eyes of the
understanding, and shine into the heart, it must needs understand. Secondly,
God does infuse or power the habit of faith into man, whereby he gives to will
to come unto Christ, and to enjoy him. The first work of God is signified in
Scripture, by opening the eyes of the understanding: Ephesians. 1.18. Acts 26.18.
Luk^ 24.45. John 6.44. Esaias 50.5. Acts 16.14. Ezekiel. 11.19.
the second by Gods drawing us: both at least figuratively by the opening of
the ear, the opening of the heart, the taking away the heart of stone, and
giving an heart of flesh. This second work is requisite to faith, for as a
dead man can do no act of life until a living soul be breathed into him: nor a
blind eye see unless new light be given unto it: no more can man dead in
trespasses and sins, move himself to receive the promises of grace, until
the free and gracious disposition or habit of faith be infused, whereby the
will is inclined agreeably to the disposition of it, to come unto God. As man
cannot naturally see or perceive the things of God; no more can he naturally
will or desire them. And this is apparent by the hardness of man's heart that
cannot repent, till God mollify it: 1. Cor. 2.14. Isay 65.2, 3. Romans ^.5.
and by his stiffeneckednesse and stubbornness to resist the holy Spirit
speaking in the Ministry of the word, until he be renewed and changed by
grace. This habit of faith is received, not by any natural disposition of will
in us to heavenly things, for then man should live spiritually of himself,
before the life of grace be put into him: but the heart, as it stands in
obedience to Gods Almighty power, to take what stamp he shall imprint, to
follow him wither he shall draw, and to contain what he powers into it, The
increase of faith is of God.
admits this habit. And as the beginning, so the increase and progress,
the consummation and perfection of faith is the gift of God, the work of the
Spirit. Heb. 12.2. Luke 17.5. Mark 9.24. Phil. 1.6. 2. These. 1.3, 11.
Of God the increase of faith is to be asked, and from him it is received. As
we cannot will to believe, unless God prepare the heart, and give that will;
no more can we will to persevere in faith, or go forward therein, unless God
do minister strength, and sustain us by his grace.

. 5. Faith is the gift of God, and the act of man.
. 5. Faith then is the gift of God, and the act of man: a wonderful and
supernatural gift of God, and a lively motion of the heart renewed by grace,
and powerfully moved by the Spirit. The power to believe, and will to use that
power, is of God: But the act of the will in resting upon Christ is man's. It is
man that belieueth, but it is God only and altogether that inableth, stirs
up, puts forward and inclines the heart to believe. By Gods enlightening
man sees, by his teaching he understands: and the Lord enclining his will, he
wills, embraces, possesses and keeps Christ with all blessings promised
in him. So that faith is the motion of man's heart wrought in him by the Spirit
of God. Even as a wheel which of it self cannot move, yet being moved of
another, does move; whose motion though but one, is said to be the motion of
the mouer, and of the thing moved: so faith is nothing but the action of God in
man, but considered in a diverse manner it is both the act of God and man; as
wrought by God in man, it is the work of the Lord; as the motion of man his
heart being moved of God, it is the act of man. For the action of man in
believing with the heart, is nothing but his knowing and acknowledging of
things, by Gods making him know and acknowledge them; his apprehending,
willing, choosing, embracing, and retayning them, by Gods making him to
apprehend, will, choose, embrace and retain them. It is true, that we Believe,
because we will Believe: but, we will Believe, does note not the princip ll
cause, but a cause subordinate working by way of free disposition, which
di^position it receives from an higher cause, Heb. ^.4.
not from natural strength. The Just is said to live by his own faith, and
faith is called ours, or our own: not that we are the Authors, cause or
workers of it: but because we possess it, and are the special subjects in
which it is wrought by God. And also because it concerns our selves in
particular, and what we believe we believe it particularly concerning our
selves.

. 6. Not to dispute whether God does extraordinarily work faith in the hearts
of men,. 6. Faith wrought by the Word.
without the external publishing of his word, will or pleasure: this is sure,
that ordinarily the Holy Ghost does work by the Ministry of the Word. The
Word can do nothing without Gods Spirit: and ordinarily the Spirit will do
nothing without the Word. Faith is called the fruit of the lips: Esaias 57.^9.
the Word is both the mean whereby we believe, and the subject matter of our
belief. A man may see without light or color, hear without ear or sound, as
possibly as believe without the Word of God. For when faith is an affiance or
persuasion, touching the good will of God toward us in Jesus Christ, how can
we be persuaded touching his gracious pleasure, till we be acquainted with his
word, whereby he has declared it. How can I believe or certainly know that a
friend will do me this or that good turn, unless I have his word or promise
to that effect? no more could we ever know or be persuaded that God would
forgive our sins, or show mercy upon us, should he not by his Word signify
and make known the same. Romans 10.8. John 12, 6. Mark 1.15. Romans 1.16. Isay
53.1.
The Word is the Word of faith, propounding things to be believed, and
commanding us to believe. The Gospel is the word of the kingdom, the power of
God to salvation, the arm of God.

Faith is the mother of Prayer: Increased by Prayer and the use of the
Sacraments.
Prayer a means of the increase and conservation of faith. The Sacraments do
confirm, conserve and increase faith begun: but the Word only is the
instrument to beget faith. Two things are here to be looked unto: First, that
we sever not what God has joined together. Secondly, that we attribute not to
the instrument what is proper to the Author. For the Word by the Ordinance of
God is appointed to represent to our minds what it is ordained to signify,
and by it as an instrument it pleases God to work: but the whole force,
efficacy and power does flow from God, and he that created man at the first,
Mark 16.20. 1. Cor. 12.6.
is his restorer to life eternal.

If it be demanded, why do not all believe that hear the Word: Why all do
not believe that hear the Word.
The answer is, Man's wilfulness is the fundamental, radical, prime cause of
obstinate unbelief; and he belieueth not because he will not believe; which
disposition the will has of it self by nature. But the reason why one
belieueth and not another, is, because the Holy Ghost does not inwardly teach
all men, but whom he will, and join his efficacy to the Wo^d preached and
heard in whom he will. The cause of this his will, we are not bound to render,
we cannot render, but must rest in the good pleasure of God.

Though faith be the gift of God, men must use the means to obtain it.
And though no man do believe by the external hearing of the Word, unless the
inward operation of the Holy Ghost regenerating and giving faith do accompany
it, yet must all men give attendance to the hearing of the Word preached and
diligent reading, because it is the means that God has ordained for the
begetting of faith, and by precept divine they are thereunto obliged. Neither
shall it excuse any man to say, he could not believe, and if he should make
trial his endeavor would be in vain. Such frivolous pretenses shall nothing
avail before God. The less able we are to believe of our selves, the more
careful should we be to use the means that God has ordained, that we might
obtain it. Marriage was never held superfluous or unnecessary for the
propagation of mankind, because the reasonable soul is not generated by our
parents, but immediately created and infused of God. That faith is the sole
gift of God, wholly infused, not partly acquired by us, should rather incite,
then any way abate our endeavors for attaining it. For faith is not given, but
in the use of the means: and though he give not faith unto all men, he
violently withholds faith from no man that seeks it, but denies it justly to
them that willingly prefer the pleasures of sin before the pearl of the
Gospel. And as Christ infused not humane life into trees, stocks and stones,
but into bodies passiuely organized and figured for the fit habitation of the
humane soul: so neither does he ordinarily bestow supernatural grace on
every one that has a reasonable soul, but on such only as are by him
passiuely prepared for it.

The conclusion is, that we must wait daily at the posts of Wisdoms gate,
meditate seriously upon the Word of life, and nourish the motions of Gods
Spirit, as the means whereby faith is begun and increased in us.

CHAP. III.
Of Justifying faith what it is, and what things are implied therein.

. 1. IVstifying faith presupposes the knowledge of God and Christ,. 1. Faith
presupposes knowledge.
of the precepts of the word, and promises of the Gospel. Knowledge is an
antecedent, if not a part of faith. Knowledge, I say, not of the reason and
nature of the th ngs, but of revelation which rests in the meaning of the
testimony distinctly understood. The things which God commands us to believe
exceed all natural capacity, cannot be known in their essence and properties
as things natural are by the light of reason: But every belieuer must know it
to be the Word of God which he receives, and what is signified thereby, and
the things to be as they are revealed, though he cannot comprehend the reason
or causes of them. Job 19.25. John 17.3. 2. Tim. 1.1^. 2. Tim. 2.7. Acts 26.18.
Mat. 11.25, 26. Ephesians. 1.8, ^. John 6.15. 1. John 4.16.
Knowledge is put for faith, as that which ever accompanies it. When God
enricheth men with faith, he is said to open their eyes, to reveal unto them
the mystery of his will, and they are said to be taught and instructed of
him. Out of question, faith is a most wise grace, making them that be endued
therewith wise unto salvation, and that evident to the belieuer which of it
self is incomprehensible. In faith historical there must be knowledge of the
history and truth of the Gospel, much more in faith Justifying. There is such
relation betwixt Faith and the Word, John. 20.21. Romans 10.17. Esaias 55.3. Col.
1.6. and 2.^. Ephesians. 1.12.
that without the Word there can be no Faith, as the foundation being taken
away, that which should be built upon it, cannot stand. The order whereby men
are brought to the faith is this; first they hear, and then they believe.
Faith is an assent to the truth and promises of God. But no assent can be given
to a thing utterly unknown. What is more absurd then to dream of a blind
assent to we know not what, to a thing we never heard off? Howsoever faith
apprehends mysteries not to be inquired into, yet the proposition and doctrine
of all the Articles of faith must be distinctly conceived, Popish Objections
prevented.
that a man be able to understand what they are. If a man cannot give a reason
of the thing believed, he must be able to give a reason of his belief. 2.
Cor. 10.5. Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 7.
Faith captiuates our understanding unto the obedience of Christ, but is not
ignorant of Christ, or of his doctrine. It gives credit and submits to the
truth acknowledged, though it seem absurd to carnal reason, but it cherishes
not ignorance of divine mysteries exceeding all humane capacity. It subiecteth
reason to the doctrine of God and his revelation, but it neither extinguisheth
the nature of man, nor the light of reason. Faith is not a brutish captivity,
which yields up her eyes to be put out: but the understanding receiving a more
excellent sight by faith, yields up the worse, and does not loose her light,
but exchange it for the better. There is a double assent, one from reason, the
other from authority: both are made with the knowledge of the Mind; knowledge
is included in both; in the one of the cause and properties, which is strictly
called Science: in the other of the authority and truth of the reuealer, and
in that respect of the thing taught, which is called Faith. Romans 10.14, 17. 1.
Cor. 4.14. 1. Cor. 13.2. Bellar. vbi supra
How shall we believe in him of whom we have not heard? There is no sight
without some visible object, no faith without the knowledge of God in Christ.
Though knowledge be not faith, but an habit distinct from it, yet it concurres
to the being of faith, in as much as no man can assent to that he never heard
of. Wisdom is distinguished from knowledge as a thing more excellent, which
yet it presupposes: so faith is distinguished from knowledge, but cannot be
without it. The knowledge which has no ingredience into faith, is the
knowledge of that which is not revealed: for faith not only goes before such
knowledge, but utterly repels it, never admitting any curious search into Gods
secrets. But in things revealed faith knows what it belieueth, and by
believing knows the more. Faith is the cause of more ample knowledge: but
some knowledge of Gods will and pleasure is antecedent to faith. This knowledge
must be distinct, sound certain.
And this knowledge must be distinct, sound, and certain. For faith divine is
sure and certain: therefore the knowledge whereupon it is grounded must be
such as cannot deceive. The assent which faith gives to the Word of God is
absolute and unlimited, which can never be yielded, unless being certain in
it self, we know it certainly as it is, 1 Thessalonians. 5.19.20 Col. 3.16. 1. John
4.1. Acts 17.1^, 12. 1. Reg. 13.20, 21 Acts 1^.1.14. Psalm. 119.18, 34 73.144.
Col. 1.5. and 2.^. Ephesians. 1.16, 17. 2. Cor. 8.7. Hosius contra Brent. lib. 3.
Bellar. de Iustif. l. 1. c. 7.. Iudicium. Tolet. instr. Sacerd. l. 4. cap. 2.
and be assured that we conceive of it aright. The examination of doctrines
by the touchstone is commanded of God, and wonderfully commended by the Holy
Ghost: the neglect of examining what we hear does bring great peril and
danger: for such as receive doctrines upon the credit of their Teachers are
ever unsettled, apt to be seduced, and ready to start back in time of
trouble. Certain knowledge is to be begged of God both for our selves and
others: and thanks have been and should be given to God for this grace and
mercy vouchsafed unto the Saints. The Papists have much extolled the Colliars
faith, commended ignorance and disgraced knowledge, as if faith were much
better defined by ignorance, then by knowledge: but when they are pressed with
evidence of Scripture in this point, they grant that knowledge in all
fundamental points of Religion is necessary for lay people: and would color
the matter, as if they meant the knowledge of reason was not necessary to
faith, T. W. in his triple accusation of D. White.
but of revelation only. Not to dispute of their meaning in those
propositions, [though their words and practice, and matter entreated of
sufficiently argue the vanity of that excuse] we may take them as they say,
and spare labor to prove that faith cannot be a blind assent, because we have
their confession for it, that faith requires knowledge of revelation. The
Implicit faith then of them that know nothing in Religion, but believe as the
Church belieueth, Romans 1.17. and 16 1. Cor. 10.15. and 11.28. 2. Cor. 13.5. 2.
Pet. 1.5. 1. Pet. 3.15. Romans 12.1, 2.
not understanding what she belieueth or professes, is most absurd: but when
we know Christ truly and whatsoever is absolutely necessary to salvation,
there be many things wrapped up from us, which we ought to believe, in which
respect faith may be called implicit or infolded. For being compassed about
with mists of ignorance, In what respects faith is Implicit.
we attain not the understanding of many things revealed: of which we may
note very many examples in the Disciples of Christ, having not yet obtained
full illumination: John 20.9. Matthew. 16.22. Luke 24.25. Acts 1.6. and
10.14.11.2. John 4.39, 41. Heb. 11.31.
and in them, who being only stirred up by the miracles of Christ, went no
further, then to acknowledge him to be the promised Messiah. So that when a man
knows and understands in general, the substantial Articles belonging to
faith, which are contained in the Scriptures, and is ignorant only in the
particulars, whereby the said general Articles are demonstrated: and when
withal he uses the means to increase in knowledge by searching the
Scriptures, and hearing the Word preached: in this case his faith may be true,
though infolded in many particulars. Faith also may be implicit in another
respect: for many that truly believe cannot certainly affirm they do
believe: which befalls them that are touched in conscience for sin, who
bewail their offenses, and desire to be reconciled unto God. Now as in the
little tender bud are infolded the leaf, the blossom, and the fruit: so in
true sorrow, broken-heartednesse and unfeigned acknowledgement, faith and many
graces of Gods Spirit are infolded. But this is not properly understood when
we speak of implicit faith, neither is faith so much wrapped up in these
graces, as the sight of faith and sense of comfort hid from their eyes that be

. 2. Faith presupposes knowledge, and yields assent to the word of grace,. 2.
Faith is an Assent.
relying upon the authority of God, who is true in all his sayings, sincere,
faithful, constant in all promises, and can neither deceive nor be deceived.
Abraham believed God; Genesis 15.6.
the word imports, he thought the words of God to be sure, certain, stable and
constant. Moses saying, Exodus 4.31. Deuteronomy. 1.52. Exodus 4.31. and 14.31.
Israel will not believe me, means, they would not assent or give credit to
his words. And when it is said, Israel believed the Lord, and his seru^nt
Moses, thereby is understood, that they gave credit to the word of the Lord
spoken by his servant Moses. This is clear in the exhortation of Iehoshaphat
unto the people, saying, 2. Chron. 20.20.
Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be established, believe his
Prophets, so shall ye prosper. And that of David, Psalm. 116.10.
I believed, therefore have I spoken. Belief is always grounded upon the
authority and reputation of him for whose word sake we believe, and must
needs have reference to some uttered word or revelation as the object: but it
may be sustained and strengthened by other motives and inducements, experiments
and probabilities. Many objects of faith may also be evident, and that which
is believed may also be seen. John 20.29.
Thomas, because thou have seen me, thou have believed. There is a
compossibilitie of faith and evidence in diverse respects, whereby they may both
stand together in the same man, about the same object, albeit faith rest not
upon that evidence, but upon divine revelation. Faith and Science are habits
that may stand together. Faith by authority revealed Knowledge or Science by
evident demonstration. For albeit faith exceed the dimension of reason, yet
reason is subordinate to it, as sense is to understanding: And therefore as it
is no inconvenience to say, we understand the thing we see, no more then is it
to say, we believe that which is evident, in diverse respects. Many divine
things touching God which are received by faith, may also be found out by
natural reason. And if things credible by the manifest likelihood of truth
which they have in themselves, be made more credible by the known condition
and quality of the vtterer, faith relying upon the authority of the reuealer,
may be strengthened by the probability of the thing. Faith is a firm assent,
1. Firm.
as appears by the original of the word, and the arguments wherewith it is
joined. I am persuaded of the same thing, Acts 13.34. 2. Sam. 7.16. Phil. 1.6.
2. Tim. 3.14. 1. John 3.19.
that he which has begun this good work in you, will perform it until the
day of Jesus Christ. Continue thou in the things which thou have learned, and
art assured of. For thereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall before
him assure our hearts. I am persuaded that neither life, Romans 8.38.
nor death, nor Angels, nor principalities, etc. where the grounds of this
persuasion show it to be firm and infallible. And it is further manifested by
the definition of faith given by the Apostle, calling it, Heb. 11.1.
The evidence of things not seen: because it does represent those things to the
mind by a certain assent, and to the heart by certain confidence, which
cannot be comprehended by reason. Yet sometimes accompanied with doubtings.
But though faith in it self be a firm assent, yet by reason of our
infirmity it is sometimes accompanied with doubtings. The things believed of
all are one and the same: but the habit, quality or inward strength by which
they believe is not of like force in all. In it own nature faith is opposite
to doubting and wavering; O thou of little faith, Math. 14.31. and 21.21.
wherefore did thou doubt? If ye have faith, and doubt not. Whosoever shall
say unto this mountain, Take thy self away, and cast thy self into the Sea,
and shall not waver in his heart, but shall believe that those things, he
says, shall come to pass. Mark 11.23. Luke 12.29. James 1.6.
Therefore ask not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink: neither let
doubtful thoughts ascend in your hearts. Ask in faith, and waver not. But
through our weakness it is often mixed with doubtings: Lord, I believe, help
mine unbelief. Mark 9.24.
Abraham is commended for his faith, and propounded by the Holy Chost as a
pattern to all his posterity; yet was he not free from infirmities, as the
story shows in diverse particulars. Romans 4.16.
The Apostle writes thus of the faith of Abraham: And being not weak in
faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an
hundred years old, Romans 4.19, 20.
neither yet the deadness of Sarahs womb. He staggered not at the promise of
God through unbelief: but was strong in faith, giving glory to God. He
doubted not through infideliti^, but of infirmity he doubted, Genesis 16.2, 3, 4.
Genesis 12.13.
when he took Hagar, and requested Sarah to say, she was his sister. Much is
spoken in Scripture of the faith of David: but he was shaken many times, as
he confesses of himself; Psalm. 31.22.
I said in mine have, I am cut off from before thine eyes. Psalm. 73.13, 16, 22.
and 116.^1.
Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain; and washed mine hands in innocence.
I said in my haste, All men are liars. And though it be out of question, that
we are to endeavor for the perfection, as of all other graces of Gods Spirit,
so of that faith whereby we give assent to what God has revealed: yet by
reason of our weakness it comes to pass, that doubtings do many times arise
in our hearts.

2. Absolute.
The assent that faith gives to the Word of God is absolute and unlimited; viz.
to the whole truth, promises, threatenings, commandments. It will not take and
leave at pleasure: but if it apprehend in one thing what the Lord says, it
will receive his testimony, if it can apprehend it to be of God, in every
thing, and that simply because it is the Word of God, though it exceed humane
capacity and likelihood. Acts 24.14.
So worship I the God of my Fathers, believing all things that are written in
the Law and the Prophets. It is a sin for a man not to believe whatsoever God
has made known in his Word, and in that respect it is damnable not to believe
or to misbelieue any thing: But through ignorance and infirmity a Christian
may misbelieue many things without the danger of damnation. Faith should be
entire in all things, must be entire in all fundamental points, without the
knowledge and faith of which, a man of age and discretion cannot be eased: but
all error and misbeliefe does not destroy the truth of faith, no more then
every imperfection does the truth of righteousness.

A man may misunderstand diverse places of Scripture, and thereupon hold that to
be true which is false, and yet be saved for all this error. Acts 1.6. and
2.2, 3.
The Apostles themselves for a long time, even till after the Ascension of our
Savior into Heaven, and till the coming of the Holy Ghost upon them, looked
for the establishment of an earthly Kingdom in this world by their Lord and
Master. Did they not slip into this error by misbelieuing the prophesies of
the Old Testament, Psalm. 72.17. Dan. 1.14.
concerning the Messiahs Kingdom? yet were they out of danger of damnation,
and in the state of grace all that time because they rested on Christ, as the
spiritual Savior of their souls, that should take away their sins, and
bring them to everlasting life in Heaven, though they erroneously hoped for a
temporal kingdom also. And after they had received the gifts of the Holy
Ghost, for a time they were ignorant of the conversion of the Gentiles. Acts
11.2, 3.
He that belieueth the truth in one thing, because God has revealed it, will
believe every thing that he understands to be revealed of God: But he that
holds the foundation of faith firm, and stable, may dissent in some things
from that which is generally holden without peril of damnation, because he
discerns it not to be of God.

Faith is an evident assent: 3. Evident.
perspicuitie of truth in the object apprehended and certainty of persuasion
are two twins that live and die together. In this life it is impossible for
us fully to comprehend any one point of Christian faith; yet are they plain
and perspicuous in a sort to the spiritual, not to the natural man. There is
a manifestation of things by reason and by revelation: and there is an evidence
direct and an evidence by consequence: an evidence of the thing in it self,
and by the effect: an evidence to the natural man, and an evidence to the
spiritual man. Matters of faith are manifest by revelation, but to reason
unsearchable, incomprehensible: seen by faith, to the natural man invisible,
incredible. The Divinity of the Scripture is in it self evident to the
spiritual man, so is it, that there is a Providence: other things are evident
from this ground; That all truth contained in Scripture is to be embraced,
though with opposition to all other professions: and that the profession of
Religion is not to be relinquished, nor good success to be despaired of, for
all the arguments the Devil, the World, and the Flesh can oppose against them.
The apprehension of the joys of Heaven cannot be distinct and evident in this
life: but that God has provided such joys for his Elect, as it is certain
from testimony of Scripture, so it is evident from the present peace of
conscience, which the faithful enjoy. 1. John 3 2.
Beloved (says the Apostle) now we are the sons of God, and yet it does not
appear what we shall be: but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be
like him: for we shall see him as he is. The joys which be prepared for the
godly, and of which the Apostle steadfastly hoped to be pertaker, are as yet
unseen: but that they shall actually be accomplished, is confirmed by the
faithful promise of God, whereof we have evident and full assurance. The
Apostle describing faith to be the evidence of things not seen, Heb. 11.1.
does it not to disparage the evidence, but rather to set forth the excellency
of that heavenly grace, which includes an evident knowledge and apprehension of
some things present, which the world sees not.

4. Discoursiue.
Faith also is in some sort an assent discoursiue, as from manifest experiences
of Gods works and favors wrought and vouchsafed according to the word of
promise, the Saints infer a possibility or certainty of like to ensue. Thus
David, The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the Lion, 1. Sam. 17.37.
and out of the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this
Philistine. Nothing is more ordinary in the Book of the Psalms, then for the
servants of God to draw conclusions of future protection, deliverance, help,
and comfort from present or former blessings. Psalm. 3.3.
I call to remembrance my song in the night; I commune with mine own heart,
Psalm. 77.6. and 143.4.
and my Spirit made diligent search. We received the sentence of death in our
selves, because we should not trust in our selves, but in God who raised the
dead. 2. Cor. 1.9.10
Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust,
that yet hereafter he will deliver us. I fervently look for and hope, that in
nothing I shall be ashamed: but that with all confidence, as always, so now,
Phil. 1.20.
Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or death. I was
delivered out of the mouth of the Lion: 2. Tim. 4.17, 18.
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto
his heavenly Kingdom.

. 3. Moreover, Justifying faith is an obedientiall confidence,. 3. Faith is an
affiance or confidence.
or affiance conjoined with affection of piety, simply and in comparison
cleaving to the mercy of God in Jesus Christ as better then life, and to the
Commandments of God as necessary, good, worthy to be stuck unto, not only
whilst considered in themselves, or in general, or without such encumbrances
and occurrences as do often interpose or hinder practice: but even whilst
actually compared with present loss of any sensual good thing, or infliction
of any temporal evil, wherewith the World, the Devil, or the Flesh, can
oppose their price. That faith is an affiance or resting upon the promises,
appears by the several words used to express the nature of that faith or
belief, which the Lord requires of his people, to the end they might receive
any blessing from him, or have his protection or assistance. The first word is
translated Believe, 2. Chron. 20.20. Genesis 45.26. Psalm. 27.13.
but signifies such a belief as is opposed to fainting: I had fainted,
unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the
living. And it implies trust in the Word of God as sure and stable: it is
sometimes translated steadfast or constant, Psalm. 78.37. Psalm. 78.22.
and expounded by trust: They believed not in God, and trusted not in his
salvation. The second word is opposed to feebleness of Mind, fear and doubt,
and imports 1. Chron. 5.20
to trust securely: Psalm. 78.53. and 146. Pro. 28.17, 25. Ps. 4.8 and 22.9. and
25.2. Isay 12.3. Psalm. 112.7. and 118 8. Psalm. 125.1. Prou. 3.5. Psalm. 118.8.
Psalm. 2.12. Psalm. 11.1. Psalm. 36.7. Ru h. 2.12. Psalm. 64.10. Nah. 1.7.
I will trust, and not be afraid. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his
heart is fixed trusting in the Lord. They that trust in the Lord, shall be as
Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abides for ever. The third is rendered
to trust, but signifies to betake himself to one as to his b castle or hiding
place. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him; How excellent is thy
loving kindness, O Lord, therefore the children of men put their trust under
the shadow of thy wings. The Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be
given thee of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him. The Lord is
good, a strong hold in the day of trouble, and he knows them that trust in
him. Hence God is called our protection or hiding place, to which we may fly
in trouble, and find shelter: Psalm. 46.1. Joel 3 16.
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in time of trouble. The
fourth is to lean upon, even as a man would stay himself on a staff,
wherewith he is underpropped. 2. Chron. 16.7, 8. 2. Chron. 14.11. Prou. 3.5.
Isay 31.1. 2 Chronicles. 13.18.
Because thou have relied upon the King of Syria, and not relied on the Lord
thy God, therefore is the Host of the King of Syria escaped out of thy hand?
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many charets and
horsemen? yet because thou did rely upon the Lord, he delivered them into
thine hand. Isay 10.20.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such
as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that
smote them, but shall stay upon the Lord the holy one in truth. Two of these
words are used together in diverse places, and may serve to expound each other:
Wherefore, thus says the holy one of Israel: Isay 30.12.
Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and
stay thereon. Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, Isay 31.1.
and stay on horses, and trust in charets, because they are many, and horsemen
because they are very strong: but they look not unto the holy one of Israel,
neither seek the Lord. Who is among you that fears the Lord, Isay 50.10.
that obeys the voice of his servant, that walks in darkness, and has no
light, let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. Another
word there is almost of the same signification, which notes with all the mind
and thought confidently to lean or stay upon a prop. Isay 48.2.
They call themselves of the holy City, and slay themselves upon the Lord God
of Israel, the Lord of Hosts is his Name. So it is noted of the people of
Israel, that they rested or leaned upon the words of King Hezekiah, co^forting
them against the rage of Senacharib. 2. Chron. 32.8.
This word is coupled sometimes with one or two others; Thou art my hope, O Lord
God, thou art my trust from my youth. Psalm. 71.5, 6.
By thee have I been holden up or underpropped from the womb. He shall not be
afraid for evil tidings; his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. Psalm.
112.7, 8.
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire
upon his enemies open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps
the truth, may enter in. Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
stayed on thee; because he trusts in thee. Isay 26.2, 3, 4.
Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
strength. The sixth word signifies, to roll or cast himself upon the Lord; as
a man in danger of drowning catches fast hold of some willow or other thing
that hangs over the water, and is at hand; or as he that is pressed with
with a grievous burden above his strength, eases himself resting it upon some
post or block, that is able to bear it. Psalm. 22.8.
He trusted in Lord that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he
rolled himself on the Lord. Roll thy way upon the Lord; trust in him, Psalm.
37.5. Pro. 16.3. Ier. 17.5. Psalm. 62.6, 7.
and he shall bring it to pass. Roll thy works upon the Lord and thy
thoughts shall be established. To trust in Man is to make man his arm, letting
his heart go back from God: and to trust in God is to place our strength in
him.

In the Scriptures, confidence is often put for faith, and trust expounded by
belief; Psalm. 2.12. and 34.8. Mark 16.16. Esaias 26.3. Romans 5.1. Psalm. 22 5.
Romans 10.11. Psalm. 112.7, 8. Heb. 10.38.
as where the Old Testament commands trust, the New Testament requires
faith: and in the New Testament the same things are attributed to faith and
belieuers, which in the Old Testament are attributed to confidence, and them
that trust in the Lord. In the New Math. 9.2.22 Luke 5.20. 1. John 5.13, 14.
Acts 27.21. Luke 16.11. Romans 3.2. and 4.19. Mark 11.24.
Testament Faith and Belief are put for trust and affiance: and to believe is
not only to assent, but to rest upon and embrace. The phrase which the Holy
Ghost most commonly uses to express Believing in Christ, is neither in the
Greek Translation of the Old Testament, nor [for ought has been yet
obserued] in any Greek Author whatsoever, except those that did write since,
and took it from the Scripture. To believe in God or in Christ, is for
substance and sense, to trust to God or Christ, and this kind of speech is
usual amongst Greek Writers: To help us in the understanding of this matter,
the seventy in their Greek afford another phrase marvelous significant,
(...). Psalm. 2.12. 2. Chron. 16.7. Psalm. 77.26. and 111.7. and 124.1
To believe on or upon God. This the Holy Ghost uses often: but withal he
becomes the Author of a new Sept. (...). Acts 19.4. and 20, 21. and 24.24
Math. 9.42. John 1.12.
phrase himself, to make us the more easily and fully understand, what faith
he means in the matter of our Justification. And though the John 2.23. and
12.42.
phrase be sometimes used, when true and lively confidence is not understood,
yet it is more then probable, that the Holy Ghost by that new manner of speech,
would propound somewhat more then bare assenting to the truth of what was
promised. And if we consider the passages of Scripture, wherein the phrase is
used, it will be plain and evident. To him that works not, Romans 4.5.
but belieueth on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness. What is this, Belieueth on him that justifies the ungodly? no
more, but belieueth those things to be true, which he affirms, who justifies
the ungodly? that is not probable. Romans 9.33. 1. Pet. 2.6.
Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone, and rock of offense; and whosoever
belieueth on him, shall not be ashamed. How can a man believe on this rock,
unless he lean upon it, or stick and adhere unto it. Faith looks at the
promises as true, and puts forth it self to receive and embrace them as
good, which cannot be done by a bare persuasion of the Mind. If the promises
were only true, but no ways beneficial, there might be an ^ssured persuasion
of them in Mind, without any affection or moving of will toward them: But
faith adhereth to the word as good to me, as well as true in it self, which
cannot be done without a godly affection embracing it. To believe on Christ,
is, to receive him. John 1.12. Col. 2.6.
And what is this receiving? Not only a comprehension of the understanding, but
an embracing of the heart and affection, laying hold on him, as we take that
with the hands which is reached unto us. Believing on Christ is implied in the
phrase of going or coming to Christ, which going, John 6.^5.
no doubt, is rather a spiritual motion of the heart and affections toward
Christ, then a contemplation of the Mind contented to see and behold him. The
Holy Ghost speaking of Justifying faith does use the entire phrase 1. Pet.
1.8.21. Acts 16.31. Rom 9.33. 1. Pet. 2.6. John 14.1. and 3.16. and ^.35.36.
of faith in God and Christ, or on God and Christ, which either there or
elsewhere is declared by confidence or trust in God and Christ. And the same
must be understood, when nothing is added, Math. 16 16. John 20.31. Romans 10.9.
1. Cor 15.2, 3, 4. Acts 8.37.
but life or Justification is attributed to belief; that Jesus Christ is the
Son of God. For it is a general rule, that words of knowledge are words of
affection, much more words of belief. As the people of God looked for the
Messiah, so according to the prophesies, they promised to themselves all good
in and by the Messiah. The woman of Samaria could say, John 4.25.
When the Messiah comes, he will teach us all things: Where we may see, that
there was not only a knowledge of Christ to come, but an expectation and hope
placed in him, as in whom all good things promised, should be accomplished. So
that if we consider the disposition of the people, whose hope did hang on the
Messiah, we may plainly understand, that to believe the Messiah, is not only
to know, but to have an affiance in him. If by believing that Jesus is Christ,
no more be meant but bare assenting unto that truth, Mark 1.24.
then the Devils profess as much. But that belief to which life is ascribed,
is not a bare action of the understanding, but of the heart and will. It is
such a belief, as whereby Christ is to our hearts that which we believe him to
be: whereby we come to Christ, believe in him, and rest upon him for
salvation: whereby we believe to our own use and comfort that which we
believe. It is such a belief as desires, seeks, embraces, holds, ioyeth
in that which it belieueth, because therein it sees peace: Popish Objections
prevented.
whereby we so believe that Jesus is Christ, as that according to that we
believe him to be, we put our trust and confidence in hm. Romans 4.19, 20.
Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 6. Romans 4.18.
The faith of Abraham is commended for the firm assent that he gave to the
promise of God: but the confidence of his heart resting upon and cleaving unto
the promise, is not obscurely declared. For the Apostle says, Abraham believed
above hope, that is, he conceived firm confidence in heart of the truth and
power of God, which is manifest by the Antithesis, He doubted not by As the
vulgar has it. Romans 4.20.
distrust or infidelity: for incredulity is as well the distrust Math. 14.31.
and 17.20. Mark 9.24.
of heart, as the hesitation of mind. If Abraham had only acknowledged the
truth of that which God promised, and not trusted to him for the performance
thereof, what could that faith have profited him? What can it avail any man to
justification, that he holds Jesus Christ to be the only Savior, and faith in
him the only means of salvation, if he do not withal rely upon him to be
saved by his mediation? What, that the Apostle himself applying that
particular of Abraham to all belieuers, expounds that believing, by
confidence in or relying upon God: Romans 4.24.
which believe on him, that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead. Faith is
the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen, Heb.
11.1.
not only because it makes things speculatiuely to subsist in the Mind, Bellar.
de Just. lib. 1. cap. 5.
but much more because it makes them Heb. 4.16. and 10.22.35.
fiducially to subsist in the heart, as appears by the Apostle putting Heb
3.6.14. 2. Cor. 9.4. and 11.17. Ezekiel. 19.5. Mich. 5.7. Psalm. ^8, 11. Sept.
substance and confidence for the same. For the subsistence of things hoped for
is trust or confidence, whereby we rest on the promises divine, knowing and
being persuaded that God will make good whatsoever he has spoken: And faith
is the substance of things hoped for, because it is a confident resting upon
God for the accomplishment of what he has spoken, as if it were already
fulfilled. And so it is the demonstration of things to come, not intellectual
only, but fiduciall: which is a sweet motion of the heart, enlarging it self
and resting in the mercy of God present and to come, and making things to come
in a sort present to the heart in respect of the promise made by God, and the
taste and inchoation of the good promised. Heb. 11.3.
That faith is an assent to divine revelation, that it is in the understanding,
and that the act of faith is to understand, no man denies: but it is assent
conjoined with affiance, not a bare, but fiduciall assent: which is referred to
God as h^e is faithful in performing promises, as hope is referred to him, as
he has power and authority: to perform whatsoever he has promised. The
Apostle says, Ephesians. 3 12. Bellar. de Just. l. 1. cap. 6.. 1.
We have boldn^sse and access, with confidence by the faith of Christ: which
passage does rather prove faith to be confidence, then otherwise: for
confidence may be joined to faith as his proper passion. A man is said to work
by reason, because he is reasonable: so faith to come unto God with
confidence, because it is fiduciall. Nothing can make another thing hot, which
has not heat in it self; nor could faith in gender confidence in the
belieuer, if in its own nature it did not contain the same. God is love
essentially and originally, and yet he works love in us, 1. John 4.8.
another kind of love, which is an Image and effect of his love. Love in which
we observe the Commandments, is the ^ormall effect of love, the effects of
love flow from love. As the effect is, so is the cause. Can the waters be
sweet, if the fountain be bitter? Confidence accompanying faith respects
all the promises of God, and is the storehouse of all particular confidence:
the confidence wrought by faith, is the particular application of this general
confidence. Confidence considered as it does embrace Christ with a certain
affiance, is the form of faith: as it begets in us quietness of
conscience, and confidence of liberty it is an effect of faith. The meaning of
the Apostle seems to be this; Because we are reconciled unto God by faith in
Christ, Rom 5.1, 2, 3. Romans 8.33.
therefore in confidence or confidently we come unto God, neither distrusting,
nor doubting that we have access unto him. So that by confidence in Christ,
we have confidence in God to obtain those things that we stand in need of.
Moreover confidence is opposed to doubting, when the 1. Cor. 1.14, 15 2. Cor.
^.1. 2. Cor. 8.22. 2. Cor. 10.2.
understanding does cleave to neither part of the contradiction, but does
floate betwixt both; and to Distrust when the will does choose not to trust to
the promiser. And if we expound the words of the Apostle in the passage before
cited, of confidence as it is opposed to doubting, the sense runs plainly.
By faith we have so free and full access, that we do not doubt, but we
shall obtain what we ask.

affiance.
joined with an affection of piety: for as it makes plea for mercy, so it
thrusts forward in obedience; as it unites the heart to the promise, so it
glueth fast to the Commandments; Psalm. 119.66.
as David says, Psalm. 119.66.
Teach me good judgment and knowledge; for I have believed thy Commandments.
By faith Noah moved with reverence, prepared the Arc for the saving of his
household. Heb. 11.7. Genesis 12.1. Heb. 11.8, 9. Gen 13.8. and 14.19.
By faith Abraham left his Country and Kindred, and forsook all strange
Religions and Idols to follow God: By faith he contentedly abode in the land of
Canaan, as in a strange land, etc walking from place to place remained in
tents, and in every place showed his godly devotion in making an Altar, and
calling upon the Name of the Lord: He kindly yielded to his Nephew Lot, for
avoiding of contention; charitably rescued him when he was taken prisoner; Genesis
24.1. Genesis 1^.23. and 20.27.
carefully provided a wife for his son Isaac; fervently entreated for the
City of Sodom, and meekly prayed for him that had taken his wife. He is
honorably commended by God himself for his good instruction to his household,
children and posterity, Genesis 18.19.
that they might walk in the ways of the Lord: But above all other he
approved his faith in this, that upon Gods Commandment he so readily offered
up his Son Isaac, being (after Ismaels expulsion) his only Son, his
beloved son, and concerning whom he had received the promise of life and
salvation, Heb. 11.17.
and the establ^shment of the Covenant. Moses consent in this doctrine may be
found, where God pronounces the Law of the ten Commandments, teaching all
duties of good works to God and Man, saying, I am the Lord thy God; Exodus
20.1, 2. Rainol. Apol. These. Sect. 4. Zanch. de Redempt. lib. 1. cap 12. de
praecept.
he thereupon infers all their obedience to those Commandments. For what
is, I am the Lord thy God, but the covenant of faith to be their God in the
promise of Christ? upon this he requiring obedience in a godly life, does
insinuate, Tilen. Syntag. part. 1. cap. 36.. 18, 19, 28, 29. Perkins golden
Chain, cap. 20 Vrsin. explic. catech. etc. Deuteronomy. 6.12.
that they which believe God to be their God, must declare the same by
obedience to his Commandments. And therefore he says in another place,
Beware thou forget not the Lord thy God, not keeping his Commandments: which
shows plainly, that where disobedience is, there is no faith: for how can he
have faith, that forgets him, in whom he should believe. And this does
Moses aim at, when he says, Deuteronomy. 26.17.
Thou have avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways,
and to keep his Statutes, and his Commandments, and his Judgments, and to
hearken unto his voice. Whereby it appears, that unto faith in couenanting
with God, this is an inseparable consequent: that if we embrace God by faith,
we must and ought to follow his Commandments by our deeds, and he that does
not this latter, bewrays that he has not with a true heart and faith
received the former. To believe is not only to give credence to what the
Scripture says, but to embrace what is said with an entire adherence of soul,
and to cleave unto it. 2. Chron. 6.8, 9
He that leans upon the Lord, his heart is upright before him: and he, whose
spirit cleaves not steadfastly unto the Lord, is incredulous. Therefore the
Prophets which expound the Law, Psalm. 78.9.
in the person of God say thus; A Son honors his Father, and a Servant his
Master: Mat. ^.6.
If then I be a Father, where is my honor? and if I be a Master, where is my
fear? Now we know that we are Sons no way but by faith: Therefore this
Prophet intends, Gal. 3.26.
that we are not ioyn^d to the Lord by faith, either as his people, children,
or servants, or that he is our God, Father and Lord, except our faith be
unfeigned and operative in honor and fear. And another Prophet says, Psalm.
116.10.
I believed, therefore I spoke, making it a most assured thing, that a lively
faith will show it self by outward deeds, and namely profession. Mercy and
obedience are linked; Christ is both a Lord and Savior: and that faith which
makes a plea for mercy, does embrace the Commandments; that which receives
Christ as a Savior, submits unto him as a Sovereign. The strength of faith
is equal to the promises of life, and to the offices of piety and love: or if
there be any difference, it is weakest to lay hold upon the promises, because
they are most spiritual, and furthest removed from sense. Confidence and
relying upon the mercy of God in Christ for salvation may be less then care
and ability to walk in obedience, greater it cannot be. The word that in the
Old Testament signifies, to seek* is by the seventy translated, Hope, Isay
11.10. Romans 15.12.
which interpretation the Apostle allows: whence it follows, that true
confidence, the mother of hope, does lift up the heart to seek the Lord in the
way of his Commandments. Moreover, says is opposed not only to doubting,
diffidence, and fainting: but to wavering, double-mindednesse, halting,
disobedience, stubburnnesse; by reason of the necessary connection of those
parts in both opposites. Ask in faith, and waver not: Jam. 1.6.
A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. Through unbelief thou art
broken off, Romans 11.20. Heb. 3.12.
and thou stand by faith. Take heed, brethren, lest at any time there be in
you an evil heart and unfaithful, to depart away from the living God. They
profess that they know God, but by works they deny him, and are abominable
and disobedient or unfaithful. Tit. 1.16. John 3.36.
He that belieueth in the Son has everlasting life: but he that belieueth
or obeys not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him. Now if incredulity be not without diffidence and disobedience: true faith
in God is not without confidence and affection of obedience. Hereunto may be
added, that the manifold rebellions of Israel in the Wilderness are called
unbelief. They believed not in God, Psalm. 78.22, 32.
and trusted not in his salvation: For all this they sinned still, and believed
not for his wondrous works: I will therefore put you in remembrance, though
ye once knew this, how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land
of Egypt, Jude 5.
afterward destroyed them that believed not. And belief in Christ infers
the keeping of Gods Commandments, whereunto the soul is inclined by faith.
And this is his Commandment, 1. John 3.23, 24.
that we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one
another, as he gave us commandment. And he that keeps his Commandments,
dwells in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abides in us, by
the spirit which he has given us.

. 5. This faith is an affiance wel-rooted and kindly planted,. 5. Affiance must
be wel-rooted. Luke 8.15.
so that it diffuseth it virtue into every affection, even the whole mass,
which it is ordained to purify and season. It is so close settled and fastened,
that neither the fear of persecution can scorch it, nor the cares of this
world choke it, nor the love of pleasure wither it: and being so deeply set, it
disperseth the virtue of the word into every faculty of the soul, whereby we
are seasoned, as a little leaven leaueneth the whole lump, wherein it is hid.
Temporary faith makes it abode in the confines or suburbs of the soul, Math.
13.33.
the external face of the heart, but soakes not into the bottom of it: either
it has but shallow rooting, or at best, can n^uer get under the love of
pleasure or worldly cares, which are fast riuetted in, and will not be removed
out of the affections; and being planted shallow, it does not, it cannot send
it virtue into the several faculties of the soul to season them throughout.
For so far as the word enters it seasoneth: but being entertaine^ slightly
with subordination, it seasoneth but superficially.

2. Sound and permanent.
2. Justifying faith is a sound and permanent affiance, which arises from the
firm setting and rooting of it in the heart. For when the word of life is
steadfastly, distinctly, certainly assented unto, and sincerely embraced, no
temptation or assault can make a man flinch, shuffle, or start aside from the
constant prosecution of salvation in the way of life, and the faithful
practice of such duties as God prescribes for the attaining of that end. Faith
that is sincere in quality, is ever sound in degree, being of strength to make
resistance against all opposition that shall encounter it, having taken the
heart for it Fort and defenced Tower. Again, faith being once set in the Heart
as in it throne and seat of Majesty, does every day confirm and strengthen
it self more and more, whereby the belieuer grows more resolute to withstand
all assaults and temptations shot against him. The faith that takes kindly,
spreads it self by assent and close adherence to every object within the
sphere of divine Truth, to which it cleaves inuincibly, and from which it
cannot be separated by any adverse power, or carnal allurement, natural
passion or fiery assault. The Temporary belieuer acknowledges the sum of
Christian duties or practices, and subscribes unto them in groan, y^^ (...)
particulars: but ever with limitation, subducting as much as well pleasing
humors disallow, until he finally dissolve what true faith builds, even
unto the first foundation, if the opposition of carnal fears, hopes, love or
hate come once to be eager and direct. And this comes to pass, because the
word was never rightly planted in an honest heart: for as the tree that is not
set deep to take lively rooting, does in success of time wither, though for
many years it may bring forth both leaves, buds and fruit: so is it with the
temporary belieuer, because the word is not well hid and rooted in him.

3. As faith is a sound, so is it an ouer-ruling affiance, 3. Ouer-raling
exercising an universal, mild soueraignetie in Man. Faith ordinarily rules
where it dwells: but the regiment is mild and gentle, not rigorous and
tyrannical. For it seasoneth our inbred affections, alters the taste of
every appetite, qualifieth and strengthens our natural inclination to that
which is good, and powerfully persuades to deny our selves and follow the
Lord. It has every desire at command, or as it were vndershot, that it dares
not stir to it prejudice, but by stealth, or some secret advantage espied by
the flesh unable to stand out against it: It is of strength to make resistance
against all opposition, and break the violence of every inclination contrary
to such motion as it suggesteth, having it force united by close reposall in
the heart. It curbeth untruly passions; as the power of a kingdom does easily
quell a company of Rogues that make inrodes upon the borders, but cannot set
footing in the heart of the Kingdom. Whatsoever is in the world, whereby we
might be drawn away from God, that is subdued and vanquished by the power of
faith: The prauitie of nature, the wiles of Satan, all evil concupiscence,
whatsoever is opposite to the Spirit of God, that is brought under by the might
of faith. True it is, that our warfare does last during life, our conflicts are
daily, new and diverse battles are moved against us by the enemy almost every
moment: but in all these faith is victorious. This is the victory whereby we
overcome the world, 2. Tim. 1.12. 1. John 5.4, 5.
even our faith Who is he that ouercomes the world, but he that belieueth that
Jesus is the Son of God. Phil. 4.13.
I am able to do all things through Christ that strengthens me. David first
encounters a Lion and a Bear, and afterward ouercomes the great Goliath: so
true and lively faith first begins with petty desire, and passions or such
temptations, as are incident to our present state and calling, and having
gotten mastery over them, still increases as difficulties or oppositions
multiply, until at length Satan, the world and the flesh be brought into
subjection. But Temporary faith keeping residence only in the outface of the
heart, is ouerswayed and ouerborn in temptation by every strong desire, or
deep-rooted passion. It may perhaps suppress someone or few exorbitant
passions, and keep under the out breach of some others: but the passion it
self does still live, and bear sway to keep faith out of it throne, and in
time will prevail to choke the seed of grace.

4. Most humble.
4. Of all graces faith is the most humble; a poor petitioner, a begging hand;
receiving all things of favor, challenging nothing to it self, ascribing all
good to the praise of grace: It fights manfully, triumphs victoriously,
works by love: but in all this it magnifieth the grace of God, relyeth upon
him and seeks his praise.

. 6. Lastly, Justifying faith for nature and quality is a spiritual taste,.
6. Faith is a spiritual taste.
howsoever defective for degree. It receives the word, tastes, relisheth, and
retains it, as the most sweet, wholesome, and delectable food. There is the
same proportion betwixt the word of life, the food of the soul, and the lively
faith, that is betwixt bodily food and the instrument of bodily taste. Isay
55.2.
Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
delight it self in fatness. Heb. 4.2.
The word profited them not (says the Apostle. speaking of the Israelites)
because it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it: where the doctrine
of salvation is compared to wine, which profits not, unless it be drunken,
that is, received by faith: and to believe is spiritually to drink the cup of
salvation. My soul thirsts for thee (says David) Because thy loving
kindness is better then life, my lips shall praise thee: Psalm, 63.1, 3, 5.
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, etc. To believe in
Christ, John 6 35, 50, 51, 53, 54.
is to eat the flesh of the Son of man, and to drink his blood. Temporary
faith tastes the word as men do meat, which they spit out again; receives
it as a raw stomach does meat, which it vomiteth up and cannot hold: Heb. 6.5.
but it never feeds kindly upon the several parts of the Word of life, nor
stands affected toward it, as a good stomach does to wholesome nourishment,
which is evident in that the weeds of earthly-mindednesse, pride, pleasure are
not stocked up by the roots: and where these abide, the soul is not rightly
tempered to apprehend the worth and quality, or feed upon the juice of
heavenly mysteries. But where true and lively faith has residence, the soul
is tempered to symbolize with divine goodness, and stands affected to the
several branches of the word, as a good appetite does to wholesome food of
diverse qualities. Faith admits many interruptions.
This is the nature of Justifying faith: but it admits many interruptions in
acts or operations. The Mind is sometimes darkened with mists arising from our
natural corruptions; sometimes our passions stir violently, that we cannot
do as we would, nor continue our adherence unto the Word of life, as better
for the time being, then the prosecution of some sensual good, that for the
present does move our affections, and is stolen into them. Natural taste is
distempered with sick humors that abound in the body: so is the spiritual
with temptations from without, and spiritual diseases from within. Thus it is
with the best oftentimes in this life, whilst the mind is clouded with
earthly thoughts, and the heart assailed with carnal lusts, which through
weakness or neglect of watchfulness creep upon and disturb them for a time:
but in their right temper and good plight they are much better; they taste and
feed upon the Word of truth, and the favor of God is sweeter to them then all
the delights of the sons of men. We conclude then that Justifying faith is a
firm, absolute, unlimited assent, and wel-rooted, al-seasoning, sovereign
affiance, whereby we rest upon Christ for salvation, embrace the mercies of God
as better then life, and feed upon the Word with sweet refreshing and delight.

CHAP. IIII.
Love is not the soul of faith, yet Justifying Faith cannot be without Love.

. 1. FRom that which has been spoken of the nature of faith, 1. Love is not
the soul of Faith.
these two things do plainly follow: First, That love is not the life and
soul of faith. Secondly, That Justifying faith cannot be without love. As
light and heat in the Sun be inseparable, so is faith and love, being knit
together in a sure band by the Holy Ghost: but love cannot be the form or
soul of faith. Liuelihood is the qualification, Love the companion, Works the
fruits or effects of that faith that justifies: but faith receives not it
virtue, life or efficacy from Charity or any other virtue, but from the
Spirit of whom it is breathed into us, from whom also it receives that it may
give force to all other virtues and good works, whereby they are virtues and
good works. It is faith and not Charity that gives influence to all other
graces, even to Charity it self; as faith increases, so other graces
increase; as faith decreaseth so other graces decrease: the l fe of faith is
our life, the strength of faith is our strength: if our faith be we^ke, there
is nothing else whereby we can be strong. It is the essential form or act
of faith to accept of the promises of mercy, Heb. 11.33. Gal. 3.14, 22. Math.
8.13. Romans 4.16. Romans 3.27.
whereby we obtain them also; God having appointed that as a condition, that
the promise might be sure to all the seed, to exclude boasting, and to set
forth his free grace and favor. But Charity cannot serve for that use:
because I cannot presume of that that is another, upon any conscience of my
love toward him, but upon confidence only of his love toward me. Be it that
all things are common amongst friends, before we can build the cupon, we must
have it resolved unto us, that God takes us for his friends, which can be no
otherwise but by faith only. Faith must first receive, embrace, Romans 3.25.
and hold the merit of the blood of Christ, before there can be any assurance
of friendship betwixt God and us. And although being now in friendship with
Christ, our love may give us encouragement and comfort to make use to our
selves of that that is his; yet it is not by our love that we take it to make
use thereof. For the act of love is done only by issue and passage from him
that loves to the thing that is loved, as from us to Christ; and therefore it
must be somewhat else, whereby we receive from Christ to us. How should the
goodness of God be the object of our charity, but by being first the object
of our faith. For therefore fore do we love the goodness of God, or love God
for his goodness toward us, because first we believe the same, neither can
we so love but by believing. For charity consisting simply in affection
apprehends nothing in God of it self: but receives all from faith. The form
is the beginning of actions, and that that gives influence and life to another
thing, must needs have a prioritie to that that receives it. But charity is
not the beginning of the actions of faith, specially of the act of believing;
the act of love has no prioritie to belief, but follows after it, and is
quickened by it. For by faith we embrace the Word and receive Christ, when as
charity compels us to love him, whom we know, embrace, and hold by faith.
We first ta^^^ our meat, and then love it: faith is the spiritual taste of
the soul, which feeds upon the sweet and tender mercies of the Lord, before
the heart be enflamed with love. Faith and love are different gifts and
graces: and some effects are attributed to faith which agree not to charity;
as faith is said to justify, to purify the heart, to overcome the world, to
receive the promises. Charity may be called an accidental form of faith,
that is, it is an instrument unto it for moving and stirring abroad in the
performance of all duties recommended unto us, both to God and Man: but the
life and soul of faith it is not, or the inward and essential form, whereby
it has life and being within it self, and whence proceeds a motion and
working that is proper to it self. If charity should be the form of faith,
then faith has two different forms, its proper and the form of love; then
faith should be the only pure matter of love, then should it be obedient to
love, and contained of it, as the matter is obedient to the form, and
contained of it. The Body is an instrument for the soul to work by, and not
the soul an instrument for the body to work by. The form works in the
matter, and not the matter either in, or by the form, seeing the matter of
every thing is passive only, and not active: And so it should be betwixt faith
and love, if faith were as the body, and love as the soul. But charity is
obedient to faith, faith governs charity: for whatsoever we love uprightly,
it must be known, by faith that we ought to love it, and our love must be
quickened by faith, to love it uniformly, and in right order. Faith is the
measure of love, and the measure of love is according to the measure of faith:
the intention of love according to the degrees of faith, and the breadth of
love according to the extension of faith. Where there is greater faith in God,
there is greater love to God: and as faith spreads it self so does love in
uniform manner.

. 2. 2. Popish objections prevented. Gal. 5.6.
Faith is not wrought by charity (as the Bellar. de Iustif. l 2. cap. 4. At ne
daretur and. Distinctio*
Jesuit preuerteth The Greek word is not of the passive, but of the mi^^le
voice as it is in many other places of Scripture. Gal. 5.6. Romans 7.5. 2. Cor. 4
12. In the Interlinear, faith which is effectual; Pagnin, working by love. And
so Bellarm. himself de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 15. and lib. 2. cap. 8. and lib.
1. cap. 20. Illud vero. Rhem. annot in Gal. 5.6. Sect. 3.
that text of Saint Paul) for then it will follow, that love by which faith is
wrought must needs follow, that love by which faith is wrought must needs be
before faith, whereas all acknowledge that faith has the first being. It is
faith which first hears and belieueth, and receives the word of God, and
thereby prescribes unto charity the way that it is to go, and the duty it
is to perform; it inciteth to the work, it animateth the act, and enlarges
the affection to the several branches of love, without which what is charity,
but a vild, misshapen, wandering affection, rising or falling amiss, coming
short or running over? what the partial and maimed fruits of love, but the
very carkase of a good work? Faith works by love, not as fire makes hot by
heat, which is a formal property inhere^t in it: but as the soul does this
or that by the hand which is an externe instrument conjoined unto it. That by
which a thing is constituted as by a beginning, and by which it is effectual,
that is the form thereof. But love is a grace without the being of faith,
though conjoined unto, and faith is effectual by love, as a primarie mean,
whereby it does produce other effects not as by it beginning. Christ is the
fountain of the water of life: Faith in the heart is as the pipes and leads
that receive in and hold the water: Love in some part is as the c^cke of the
corduit, that lets out the water to every co^mer. Faith iustifyeth by receiving
the gift of righteousness, which is by the merit of Jesus Christ: and goes
forth by charity, whereby as a working hand it performs all duties commanded
of God, to the glory and honor of God. What if love be the most excellent of
all graces in some respects, does it thence follow, 1. Cor 13.13. Bellar. vbi.
supra. Heb. 11.6.
that it is the life of faith? By the same reason we may argue; Whatsoever is
not of faith is sin, is of no esteem or account with God: therefore faith is
the fo^^e of all other graces. It follows not, that because the eye is a more
excellent member then the soote; therefore the eye is the soul and life of the
soote: In what respects chari ie does excel faith, and faith charity.
Noe more does it, that because charity is a more excellent gift then faith,
therefore it should be the life and soul of faith. Faith and love
respectively have the preferment each of other. In respect of spiritual life
faith is the most necessary, upon which love has necessary dependence: but
otherwise to love is more then to believe, because it necessarily includes
belief; as to taste meat ^n respect of life is of more use then to love it,
though absolutely to love meat be more then to taste it, because it
presupposes taste. If we respect latitude of use, charity is more excellent
then says, as which is extended every way to God and Men, and by which all the
gifts of God which he bestows upon us, are made profitable to other men. But
if we consider man privately in himself, and for his own use, faith is more
excellent then charity, as whereby we are radically united unto Christ, and
wherein stands orginally our fellowship and communion with him; Ephesians. 3.17.
Gal. 3.14.
by which Christ dwells in our hearts, and we receive the promised spirit;
into which as a hand, God puts all the riches of his grace of our salvation,
and by which all acts of grace are quickened; we feed upon Christ for the
strengthening and nourishment of the soul, and whatsoever is in us is
commended unto God. If we respect length of time and continuance, charity is
to be preferred before faith. For faith is but for a time, and when the promise
of God, which is the matter and subject of it, shall be fully accomplished, the
use of it shall cease. When faith passes into an open knowledge and revealed
sight of the thing present, it changes both his nature and kind. But love
abides for ever, and shall continue betwixt God and us an everlasting bond: it
shall be greater and more vehement, but shall still retain the same nature and
substance, albeit some works which now it exercises shall cease. The end of
our faith is charity: but the foundation and director of love is faith: faith
also is the victory whereby we overcome the world. To save a man faith is the
greater: in Man being saved love is the greater. Till faith have finished our
salvation love must yield to faith: when faith has fully saved us, it shall
have an end, for knowledge of sight takes away faith, but love shall abide for
ever. Absolutely love is greater then faith, but when we speak of the means
of Justification, and attainment of that salvation, whereto perfect charity
and righteousness does belong, then faith must be preferred as ^he greater and
more excellent. Faith only bears sway therein: and this slender and weak
charity which we have, is of no effect or moment thereunto. When the Apostle
makes comparison betwixt the body without the spirit, and faith without works,
James 2.26. Rhem. annot. in James 2:26. Sect. 10.
concluding that they are both dead, he cannot be thought to make love the
soul of faith. For he speaks not of internal charity, which lodges in the
heart, but of external works, which are outwardly visible and apparent unto
men, and cannot be the life, but are the fruits and effects of faith. For that
which is without and external, cannot be the life or soul of that which is
within and internal: nay it self has from within all the life that it has;
and if it receive not life from within, it is altogether dead. Works therefore
being outward, and issuing from within, if they be true, can in no good
construction be said to be the life of faith which is within, but to be the
issues and productions of faith from which they spring. Besides the word used
by the Apostle does signify the breath, and and so the comparison runs
plain; As the body of a l uing creature, if it breathe not is dead: so faith,
if it bring forth no works, is dead: For breathing is an effect of a living
body, and working is the proper effect of a living faith. If we speak of faith
as it is outwardly professed to men, works which may be discerned by the eyes
of men, not charity which is the inward affection of the heart, are they that
give name and gain credit to profession. Charity is an hand or instrument
whereby faith works: works are fruits, effects, demonstrations of the
inward life of faith: and that which gives name and being to our external
proffession, is a pure, blameless, upright conversation, fruitful in good
works. If we speak of faith, a dead faith may be compared to a dead body,
altogether void of spiritual quickening: but a lively faith cannot fitly be
resembled to living body, but rather to the life of the body: because faith is
not that which is quickened by charity or the the works of charity, but that
which quickens. Faith is the first wheel in the Clock that moves all the
rest: Faith stirs up and directs all other graces of the soul in their
operations, whose strength increases according to the liuely-hood, vigor, and
increase of faith. James 2.22. Rhem. annot. in Loc.
How then says the Apostle, That faith is perfected by works? As we judge of
the cause by the effects, and by the proportion of the effects the efficacy
and force of the cause may seem to be increased or diminished, every thing is
acknowledged to be perfect when it works, and is esteemed so much the more
perfect, by how much the more it works; as we say the goodness of a tree is
perfect, when it has brought forth some excellent good fruit. Thus
Philosophers teach, that the form is not perfect, when it is considered as the
first act, but when it is taken as the second act: for by working it puts
forth it force and declares it self. And so faith is perfected by works, not
that the nature of faith receives complement or perfection from works, but
because it does declare and manifest it self by love and good works, and is
esteemed by so much the more perfect, as the works produced are the more
excellent. Yea, as the exercise of outward members increases internal vigor
and strength, and refreshes the spirits by which we move; so does the
exercise of grace and virtue rightly employed perfect faith, not imparting the
perfection of works unto it, but stirring up exercising and intending it own
vigor and perfection. Sense and motion is the effect, not the cause of life in
the body; but yet the body without them is dead, and perfected by them. Works
are the effects, not the life of faith, but faith without works is dead, and
by works it is perfected.

. 3. There is a fained and dead faith;. 3. James 2.20. James 2.19. Act. 8.21.
Luke 8.14.
a faith whereby the Devils are said to believe, and such whose hearts are not
upright; a faith which rests barely in the understanding or which slightly
affects the heart, but is not rooted, bears not soueraignetie: a faith
subordinate to vainglory or covetous desires, which the world destroys: and
this says, as it is ineffectuall to season the affections throughout and
incite to the sincere uniform acts of love, so is it unavailable to
Justification. There is a faith unfeigned, welrooted, sovereign, 1. Tim. 1.5.
Acts 15.9. Gal. 2.20. 1 John 5.4. Justifying faith cannot be without love.
whereby we believe to righteousness, by which the heart is purified, and Christ
dwells in us: which is the victory, whereby we overcome the world: and this
faith works by love, and cannot but work. He that belieueth in this sort
loves freely, and connot but love, not through defect of liberty, but through
the nature of faith, exciting the belieuer to will to love not to love if he
will. Faith and love considered as habits of the renewed soul, and branches of
inherent holiness, have their original from the Spirit of regeneration, and be
distinct graces infused together. The deeds of charity are the proper acts or
exercises of the grace of charity, Par. de Just. lib. 1. cap. 14.
from which they issue as branches from the flock, and fruit from the tree:
nor can we properly say, that such works flow from faith, as the fruit does
from the root, seeing charity is no branch of faith, but a distinct grace of
the renewing Spirit, which bears it proper and distinct fruit. But such acts
are said to be of faith because the doctrine of faith inioyneth them, the
virtue of faith inclines the soul unto them, moves charity unto the exercise
of them, and directs and quickens the acts themselves, without which they
would be liuelesse and out of square. Faith does beget love, not that one
habit does beget another, but that faith does excite men to the works of
charity. Thus the habits of faith and love be coupled in infusion; the
exercise of faith and love be inseperably conjoined; and the acts of love be
the effects of faith. 1. John 5.1. John 1.12, 13. 2. Cor. 5.17. 2. Pet. 1.4.
Every one that belieueth is borne of God; he that is engrafted into Christ by
faith is a new Creature, and made pertaker of the divine nature. But he that is
borne of God, is endued with the grace of love. The lively members of Christ
Jesus, which receive from him the sap of grace, cannot be utterly destitute of
true charity. But all true Belieuers are living members of Christ Jesus. Gal.
2.20. Romans 11.17. John 15 1, 2. 1. John 4.15. Romans 1.17. John 3.36. and 6.40.
He that belieueth, abides in God, and God in him. But in whom God abides,
in him is love. Every true Belieuer does live spiritually, and where true faith
is, there is true life. But he that lives spiritually, and is translated from
death to life, is also endued with the grace of love. He that belieueth is in
the light, and abides therein: But no man is in the light, 1. John 2.9, 10.
who loves not. Faith and Hope be inseparable: But it cannot be, but we
should love those things, which we already know, embrace, taste, and hope to
be singularly good. Faith receives and rests upon the mercy of God as our
sovereign Good: But it is not possible for a man truly to know and embrace the
chiefest good, and yet to withold affection from the love of it. It is faith,
which setting God before us such a one as he is, wise, mighty, just,
merciful, loving and gracious toward us, enamoreth our hearts, and stirs
in us affections correspondent to his grace: neither is there any spark of
true love, which is not kindled by this means. We love God, because he loves
us first. 1. John 4.19.
But nothing can season and affect the heart, with the serious consideration,
and sweet taste of Gods mercy and favor, but faith only. In nature we see
nothing can move in desire to this or that, till first it has ^pprehended it
lovely, and it cannot but mo^e, when it has soundly tasted of it goodness: So
our affections cannot in love move to, and unite themselves with God, till by
faith we know him to be an amiable object for us sinners to embrace: and when
we have soundly and truly tasted how good and gracious the Lord is, we cannot
but love and affect him entirely. Faith is an obsequions and affianced
acknowledgement of the truth of Gods promises: But he that does after that
manner acknowledge the truth of God in Christ; is both inwardly affected
toward God, and desirous to put forth the same in all duties of holiness and
righteousness. Titus 2.11, 12.
The doctrine of grace, which brings salvation, teaches us to deny
ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live godly, justly and soberly in this
present world: which being embraced by faith, does leaven every faculty,
Popish Objections prevented. 1. Cor. 13.2. Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 15.
Rhem. annot. in 1. Cor. 13.2.
and season it in such sort, as the several affections will readily move at
the command of faith. When the Apostle seperates faith and love, saying, If I
had all faith, so that I could remove Mountains, and had not love, it
profits me nothing: he speaks of that persuasion and confidence in the
extraordinary promises of God, whereby the parties endued therewith, we^e
enabled to do miracles. And the word, All, notes manifestly the highest
degree of doing miracles. That whereas some had faith to do some miracles, and
not other some: the Apostle shows, that if he had such a miraculous faith,
that he could do all miracles, and have not love, it were nothing. This is
clear, in that the Apostle reckons faith miraculous amongst the gifts of the
Spirit, in the precedent Chapter: and by the example or instance of moving
Mountains, 1 Cor. 12.9.
which our Savior notes as a Master miracle amongst others. He says, 1 Cor.
13.2. Math. 7.20. Luke 17.6. Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 5. Sect. deinde.
If I had All knowledge, not understand ng i^ simply and absolutely, of all
kinds of knowledge, but of the gift of knowledge: and so by, All faith, he
means not all kinds of faith, but all faith of miracles. Universal
propositions must be limited according to the subject matter, unless we will
run into manifold absurdities. And that the faith he speaks of was not
fitly qualified to Justification, appears in this, that it did not command,
but rather was subordinate to their vainglorious humor. Look as their
confidence was greater in the power and extraordinary promises of God, the
more were they puffed up, boasting in themselves, insulting over their
brethren: whereas, if their affiance had been well settled upon the mercy of
God in Christ, and had rightly spread it self to the several branches of holy
truth, it would have inclined, yea, constrained them to serve one another in
love, and bend their gifts to the edification of their brethren, which, whilst
they do not, but rather turn their gifts to the service of their lusts, and
the dishonor of God, it is evident, they believed not unto righteousness.

But by what faith should these Corinthians have come to know and rightly to
value Christian love? The same by which they wrought wonders, or some other? If
the same, So Bellarmine seems to dispute, vbisupra ^. 5. Augustinus.
then faith is true though separated from love. If some other, the Apostle in
all congruitie should first have exhorted them to embrace it; otherwise he had
commended the beauty of Christian love but unto blind men. Besides, if it be
some other, then by that grace of faith, whereby they rested upon the
extraordinary promise and power of God, they had never been able to discern
betwixt good and evil, or to behold the worth and dignity of Christian love
and kindness, though never so welrooted in their hearts. To this question it
is directly answered, That the exercise of love was to be raised in these
Corinthians hearts, by faith, for common offense and qualities the same with
that whereby they wrought miracles; but by the same faith rightly set, deeply
rooted, taking better in the heart diffusing it virtue into the several
faculties, spreading it self uniformly unto the particular branches of
Christian duties, directing the affections unto spiritual objects, and fixing
them fastest upon such as it adiudgeth best, and most effectual to the
edifying of themselves and others. In lustifying faith two things are to be
considered: the common nature or substance, and the specificall nature,
plantation and sovereignty. For faith historical and Justifying agree in
this, that both the one and the other is an assent to divine truths, grounded
upon the authority of the reuealer: Faith temporary and Justifying agree in
this, that they receive the word, and rest upon the mercies of God: but in
radication, sovereignty, and working, and so in special nature, saving faith
differs from other kinds. The seed which fell by the high way side, in stony
ground, among thorns, and in good soil, was one and the same: and in most of
these grounds it took, not alike in all, kindly in the good soil alone. The
common nature of faith is to receive the Word, which some receive by bare
assent of understanding, others by sleight and superficial confidence which
vanishes away: but the doctrine of life takes kindly in the honest and good
heart, which embraces it soundly with unfeigned and wel-rooted affiance.
Justifying faith is discerned from the other kinds, not by this, that it
receives the promises which they do not: but it receives them in another
manner and degree, with firmer radication in the heart, which is the seat of
the affections, that it might season them, and subject earthly desires to the
affectation of heavenly things. Amongst the chief Rulers of the Jews, many
believed in Christ, John 12.42. Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 15.. prim^.
says the Evangelist, who yet confessed him not, because of the Pharisees,
least they should be cast out of the Synagogue. But John sometime following
the Hebrew phrase uses the term of believing in Christ, for believing
Christ, applying it to them, who by the miracles of Christ, and his manifest
declaration of the truth, were convicted in conscience to acknowledge him to be
of God, or did believe in him for a time, but did not in sincerity submit
themselves unto him. And thus it might be said of some of those chief Rulers,
John 2.23.
that they b lieued in Christ, that is, were persuaded in their minds that he
spoke the truth, but yet preferring their credit and reputation with men, gave
no regard unto it. The very reason, which the Evangelist gives, why they did
not confess Christ, makes it manifest, that their faith was not true and
lively rooted in the heart. For (says he) they loved the praise of men, John
12.43.
more then the praise of God: which who so does, his faith is not become such
as lays sure hold on the promises of life. John 5.44.
How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the
honor which comes from God only? They might have some beginnings and
dispositions to true faith, but very weak and feeble, and they might be
endued with some degree of love, but weak and feeble as their faith was. Their
faith and love was too much tied and entangled in the nets and snares of
carnal respects: but, admitting the least degree of faith, there is no ground,
to affirm, they had no love. 1. John 4.18. 1. John 5.4.
Indeed perfect love casts out all fear, and perfect faith overcomes the
world, and breeds perfect love: but there is a beginning of faith and love,
which being yet little and weak, and h^uing not as ye^ ouer-m^stered all
worldly and carnal respects, is for a time timorous and fearful to confess
Christ, but grows to strength by little and little, till it resolve to cleave
to him with loss of all other things. Such was the says of Nicodemus, John
3.2 and 7.50.51, and 19.38 Luke 23.51. Math. 26.56, 70, 7^.
and Joseph of Arimathea, yea, of the Apostles themselves, Pete not excepted,
who were ever and anon affrighted, and at his last sufferings, some denied* all
forsook our Savior and fled. And thus it may be these Rulers believed, but
their faith was very weak, and their love was according to their faith: till
increase of faith brought forth further strength of love, and they had learned
by the strength of faith and love to prefer the service of Christ before all
the glory of the world, and to adhere to the glory that comes from God alone,
as so much better then that we receive of men, that the later did seem as
nothing in comparison of the former. That which is added by the Evangelist,
that they durst not confess him, does no more derogate from their love, then
from their faith: for if they had believed firmly with the heart unto
righteousness, Romans 10.10.
they had confessed with the mouth unto salvation: and in that they confessed
not the truth with their mouths, it argues they believed but weakly with
their heart. For the faith which brings forth sincere confession is coupled
with love, but confession it self is an effect of faith. I believed, 2. Cor.
4.13.
and therefore have I spoken: we also believe, and therefore speak. The man
that came to the wedding, Math. 22.11. Bellar. vbi supra. quartum.
not having on the wedding garment, had faith (as our Adversaries object) but
wanted charity and good works. How may it appear that he had faith?
Forsooth, because he was admitted to that Table, which are the Sacraments. Not
to question that exposition for the present, was no man ever admitted to the
Sacraments, that made show of faith, when indeed he had none? Many hypocrites
are in the Church, that have not so much as a persuasion of the truth of the
Scripture, and so absolutely want their marriage garment. And men are admitted
to the Sacrament by men, and admitted for profession of faith, when they that
admit them cannot tell whether they have faith or not. For many pretend that
which is not in them, and with the mouth make profession of faith, when their
heart is barren and empty of grace. Further this man might assent unto truths
divine, and acknowledge them as true, but not from a sound and sincere ground:
or he might assent unto the Articles of Christian Faith as true and good,
whilst considered only in themselves, without opposition of such matters as he
much valued: and such belief being unsound, shallow, subordinate to earthly
pleasures or commodities, may be and is separated from love, but it is not
that faith we speak of. The general meaning of the Parable seems to be no
more but this, that many men thrust into the Church, who, when the day of
trial comes, will be found to have no interest to the Kingdom of Heaven.
What if the wedding garment be charity? this does hurt us nothing, unless it
could be proved, (which can never be) that this man had Justifying faith. For
he wanted the wedding garment, charity, because he wanted faith: and if he had
been endued with the one, scilicet faith, he should also have had the other,
scilicet, Gal. 5.6.
love: for faith works by love. But the wedding garment is as well faith as
love. It is indeed Christ Jesus himself (of whom the Apostle says)* Put ye
on the Lord Jesus. Romans 13.14. Gal. 3.26, 27.
Christ (as he is a iustifier of us from sin, and a sanctifier of us from
the power of sin, rinsing away by the water of his Spirit, that stain of
corruption defiling our nature) is that wedding garment: and so putting on
Christ, Col. 3.9, 10. Ephesians. 4.24. Col. 3.12. Ephesians. 6.15, 16.
we put on the new man, which according to God is created in righteousness and
true holiness; Now we put on Christ, when we do by an affianced knowledge,
and by consequent affections come more and more to be united with him. The
first and radical union is made by faith only, which lays hold on God in
Christ, as our merciful God, whose anger before threatened us for sin. The
secondarie union, whereby the soul cleaves more and more unto God, is by
means of the affections; by love our hearts cleave unto him, by hope, joy,
high estimation of him; whom though we have not seen, we love: but this
presupposes the former. The five foolish Virgins (they say) were part of the
Kingdom of God, and had faith but wanted works. Math. 25.11.
They were indeed part of the Kingdom in profession, but not in election.
Rhem. annot. in Math. 25.. 1.
They had a form or show of faith, but true Justifying faith they never knew.
And as their faith was, such were their works. For it appears that they had
oil in their lamps, and that their lamps were lighted, although by long
tarrying of the Bridegroom, they were afterward quenched. Our Adversaries
teach, that these Virgins had aspired to more then ordinary perfection in the
Church: and had they gotten this without good works? It is a strange
perfection that can be attained without all good deeds spiritual or
corporal. But they continued not (they will say) in their former charity,
when yet they presumed strongly on the assurance of their salvation, as is
apparent, by their confident demanding to be let in: for they said, Lord,
Lord, open unto us. Indeed they never had either true faith or love, and
therefore could not continue therein. For if ever they had been pertakers of
either in truth, they would have perseuered in both unto the end: and where the
one is utterly wanting, the other never was. Their earnest demanding to be let
in, shows rather their desire, then their hope; and yet how many hope
presumptuously without true faith in Christ? Faith is grounded upon the Word of
God, and the thing which it belieueth, is that which the Lord has said. Romans
20.8, 19.
Whatsoever we conceive of God besides his Word, it is imagination, opinion,
presumption, but faith it is not. But the Word of God denounces destruction to
the workers of iniquity, to the fruitless and barren fig tree, how can it
then be said, that they that work iniquity, that bring forth no good fruit,
have faith to believe assuredly, that they shall be saved. The Apostle makes
mention of some, who professed that they knew God, Tit^^ 1.16
but were indeed unbelievers, as the vulgar reads it. And we know it is often
threatened in the Prophets, that the wicked shall cry, Prou. 1.2 ^.
and not be heard: call in fear, but not in faith: for they that in faith call
upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10.15.
But the Apostle James (as they object) supposes plainly, that a man may have
faith without good works, that is, James 2.14. Bellar. vbi supra.
without charity, saying: What shall it profit, if a man say he has faith,
and has no works? Can faith save him? Wherein they take for granted, what can
never be proved, that the Apostle takes wo^kes for charity. Do they think,
that they against whom the Apostle writes would grant, that they were without
the love of God? The Gnostickes were never so absurd. But the question was,
whether a man that professed Jesus Christ to be the Savior of the world, was
not by this saved, how lewdly soever he demeaned himself? And it is apparent
by the text, that the Apostle speaks of an historical, dead faith, a says in
profession; as much differing from that whereto Paul ascribes righteousness,
as a live man does from a dead, or a body endued with life and motion from a
painted or carved Image. Therefore he compares ^t to the good words of him,
that wishes well to the poor man, but does nothing at all for him. As
therefore it is no true charity, which professes good will to help, and
helps not: so it is no true faith, which is severed from good works. To this
tends his question, What avails it, Iam. 2.14.
though a man say that he has faith? and his other demand, Iam. 2.18.
Show me thy faith? The uttermost he extends it to by instance, is a mere
historical faith, Thou belieuest that there is one God. Iam. 2.19.
Hi^ purpose is to show, that faith if it be truly professed has taken root
within, Jam. 2.20.
from whence spring by obedience the fruits of all good works, and if it give
not forth it self by good works, it is a dead, no true and living faith. The
men against whom he disputes did make profession of Justifying faith, Iam.
2.20, 22.
but the Apostle brings the true, lively and working faith of Abraham, as
opposite to that idle, dead, and breath-lesse faith professed by them; and
saying, Was not Abraham our Father justified by works, when he offered his
Son. Isaac upon the Altar: he means no more, then if he had thus spoken:
If Abraham had said (as they did whose empty faith he disapproues) I have
faith, but had not proved his sayings true by his deeds, or readiness to offer
up his only Son when God commanded him (for actually he did not offer him)
he had not been justified before God. Why? because he had not believed in
such sort as Paul meant, when he says; Heb. 11.19.
By faith Abraham offered up Isaac when he was tried; which was the act of his
faith, as the text expressly notes. Yea, further to show the vanity of them
that boasted of Justifying faith, because they professed faith in God, he
adds, The Devils believe also and tremble, showing, Iam. 2.19.
that the Devils go so far as to believe the truth of God, yea, further for
they tremble: and therefore the faith professed in word by those boasters
cannot be the same with that which the Scripture names for a Justifying
faith. They cannot shuffle this over by telling us, that Christian faith, when
it is naked and void of good works, Bellar. de Just. lib. 1. cap. 15. ad
tertium. W. B. against Perkins reformed Catholic. Whether faith may be without
charity.
may well be likened unto the Devils faith in two points. First, in both of
them there is a perfect knowledge of all things revealed. Secondly, W.B.
against Perkins reformed Catholic.
this knowledge shall not steed them any whit. But in many things they differ,
but this one is principal: That Christians out of a godly and devout
affection, do willingly submit their understanding to the rules of faith. But
the, Devil against his will, belieues all that God has revealed. This is but
a poor evasion, for if they will hear their brethren of Rhemes, Rhem. annet
in Math. 15. Sect. 1
they tell them plainly, that Saint James doubted not to call a dead faith
without works, the faith not of Christians, but of Devils. The Apostle then
does not liken Christian Justifying faith to the faith of Devils in some points
only, but proves the dead faith professed by some, not to be true and saving
faith indeed, because the Devils believe in that manner. The first point,
wherein the faith of Christians and of Devils is said to agree, comprehends
the fullness and perfection of that which they call Catholic or Christian
Faith, which consists in believing all to be true, that God has revealed.
No more is there in Abraham's faith, if we consider the act of faith, and no
less in the Devil, and the same in every Catholic Christian, according to
their doctrine. That which is added to show the difference betwixt the faith of
Christians and the faith of Devils is little to the purpose. For it is not
taken from the nature of faith it self, but from those things which to faith
are merely accidental. The godly and devout affection and willing submission
to the rules of faith, which is in Christians, being an act of charity, and
not of faith, differenceth not true faith in it self from the faith of
Hypocrites, but distinguishes faith and charity from faith only. And thus our
Adversaries make the Devil a Catholic against his will. Or if they will say,
that true Christian faith does always actually and necessarily imply this
godly affection, and willing submission of understanding to the rules of faith,
then because this cannot be without charity, let them say, as the truth is,
that true Christian faith cannot be separated from love and good works. It is
impertinent to dispute, whether the faith of Devils be natural, coact, and
dishonest, or the faith of wicked men supernatural, voluntary, and Honest, as
if these things distinguished the faith of ungodly men from the faith of
Devils. For if the majesty of Gods infallible truth command the assent of
Devils to that which they love not, does not the same cause also prevail with
ungodly men, who bear no affection to God or goodness. And as for the
honesty or dishonestie of the act, there can no circumstance be named, why it
should be honest in wicked men, and dishonest in the Devils: for it is
fearfully abused in both. And if it be granted, that faith without works or
grace, is in men the gift of God, but the faith of Devils not so: this argues a
difference only in the cause, not in the essence, nature or quality. And
though it be his gift, yet being without grace and charity, and without these
of necessity as unfruitful as the faith of Devils (both which our Adversaries
grant) it is no more available to make a Christian, then the faith of Devils
is. It is further objected, if faith cannot be without charity, then faith
alone does not justify. This follows not, Bellar. de Justice. lib. 1. cap.
15.. At si and. postrem^.
for it is one thing to say, faith alone does not justify, another that faith
which justifies is not alone. This latter we yield unto, the first we deny.
Faith alone does justify, that is priuatiuely considered without hope or
charity as causes concurring therewith in justification: but this faith cannot
really be separated from, or negatiuely considered without hope and charity.
For though it be true, that the total cause of any thing being in act, the
effect must needs follow, yet from the total cause we cannot separate those
things, together with which it has in nature it existence and being, and
without which it cannot be in act for the producing of the effect, though they
con^erre nothing thereto: because that is to deny the being of it, and to
destroy the cause. The eye alone sees, the ear alone hears: but it must be
a living eye, and hearing ear, not separated from the head or broken off from
the rest of the body. Faith alone iustifies without other graces, not in
regard of their presence, but in regard of their co-working with faith to this
effect of our Justification. It is one thing to say, the eye is in the head
without other senses, and another thing to say, the eye does see alone, no
other sense seeing with it. Liuelihood is the qualification of that faith that
justifies; and works, at least a preparation and promptitude of heart to good
works, is an effect of faith as immediate as Justification. So then faith
cannot be withot love, and yet we apprehend not the promises, of eternal
life by works, but by faith alone, although truly they cannot be apprehended
by parties destitute of works, at least of sincere resolution to walk in
obedience. Nor does faith alone apprehend the truth or derive the benefit of
divine promises to our selves, but by it alone, (though accompanied with all
other sanctifying graces, and attended with the whole train of good works)
we expect and pray the promises may be fulfilled, not for our sakes, or for
any righteousness we have in us, or can hope for in this Life, but only for
the merit of Christ, by his sole mediation and intercession. In brief, the
faith which justifies is operative, attended with good works of all sorts,
accompanied with all graces of the the Spirit: but we live by it as it unites
us to the Lord of life; yea by it alone, not by it and other parts of grace, in
as much as by it we trust in Gods mercies offered in Christ, wholly relying on
them, not partly on them, and partly on our works or righteousness.

CHAP. V.
Of the general object or matter of Faith Justifying.

. 1. What doctrines are called matters of Faith.
. 1. MAtters of faith strictly and properly those are called, which pertain to
the nature and essence of faith first, and by themselves; as are the points of
faith contained in the Gospel, the ignorance whereof is damnable, and the
denial heretical. But in a more large acceptance all truth revealed by God
in his holy Word, is a matter of faith, and to be believed as God has
revealed it. Hence is that rule of Divines, There are many integrall parts in
the Word of God, which are said to be of the word of faith, but not prope^ly a
matter of faith. For there are many historical, domestical, and particular
matters set down for example, not properly for faith: which we believe, not
because they pertain to saving faith, but for that they appertain to the Word
written by the Spirit of God. And not much unlike hereunto is that distinion,
that some things are necessary to be believed to salvation by themselves and
the authority of the Scriptures, as the substantial points of faith and
manners; others for the authority of the Scripture only, as those which are
not so necessary; and some neither by themselves nor the authority of the
Scripture, as are things in themselves indifferent, so long as by circumstance
they be not repugnant to faith, tru^th, love and edification.

. 2. Justifying faith is considered,. 2. Justifying faith is two ways
considered.
either according to it most eminent effect, which is to justify; or according
to it full and adequate act. For that faith which justifies, does embrace the
Commandments, believe the threatenings, look to all the promises of God made
in Jesus Christ concerning this life or the life to come, and receive the good
things promised: it sustaineth in adversities, works by love as an instrument
conjoined with it, guides all our actions, and gives firm assent unto every
article of faith and every part of divine truth; but as it justifies, it is
conversant about Christ obeying to death, that we may find righteousness and
forgi^enesse of sins to life in him, or it cleaves unto Gods mercies
manifested in that ete^nall sacrifice, always breathing out life to men,
renouncing all trust and confidence, even in such graces as we have received
from God. The truth, mercy, fidelity and power of God, with all benefits
past and to come, which it pleases God to bestow upon his people in Jesus
Christ, are the matter about which faith is exercised: but as it justifies
Christ is the full and adequate object of belief; as our reasonable soul does
see in the eye, hear in the ear, digest in the stomach, but does not reason
as it does these things, but only as it conceiueth and discourses within us.
The Object of Justifying faith two-folde. 1. General.
So that, according to the twofold consideration of justifying faith, the
object of it is twofold, General and Special 1. The General object is the
whole truth of God revealed unto us in his word, containing all Histories,
Doctrines, Commands, Threatenings, promises of what kind soever. True faith
respects the whole word of God.
True faith respects all this, and only this. Only this, because divine
revelations only be of certain and infallible truth, which cannot deceive, and
whereunto men can safely give unlimited and absolute credit: All this,
because every part of divine inspired truth is worthy of all Belief and
reverence: and so there is nothing contained in Scriptures, threatening,
promise, precept, admonition, exhortation, prophecy, or history, which falls
not in some degree or other within the compass of saving Faith. God who cannot
lie, has propounded to men for truth and to be believed, whatsoever is
delivered in Scriptures, and so it is a matter of faith; but so far forth
only, as it is intended to be held for true by the holy Ghost, the Author of
the Scripture. There is no doubt to be made, but whatsoever is registered in the
Historical Books of holy Scripture by way of report, is to be taken for true
in respect of story, that we may not doubt whether those things were done or
said, which are there reported to be done or said: But in these books, we
have some worthy speeches of godly men, and some lewd and blasphemous words of
profane and wretched men. The former are to be acknowledged to be for the
truth of God every way: the later must be acknowledged to be truly reported.
As for example, it is true that Jacob uttered those prophesies of the twelve
Patriarks his sons, Genesis 44.1.2.
and it is also true, that those prophesies of his were the very truth of God.
It is as true, that Rabshaketh delivered those blasphemous threatenings against
the Lord and his people, 1. Reg. 18.30. and 19.5.6.
but it is not true, that those words came from God, as Jacobs did: so Jacobs
were to be taken as every way true, truly related, and the truth of God;
Rabshakeths only as truly reported from his mouth, but in themselves
blasphemous.

. 3. Thus faith yields firm and absolute assent to all divine history,. 3.
1. The historical part, as the doctrine of the
as containing a certain and sure relation of those things whereof they
entreat; and to whatsoever came from God, as every way true, and to be
received: nor does it barely assent to the thing spoken as true, but moves and
stirs affections according as the nature of the thing believed should and
ought to work. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, not barely giving credit to Moses relation touching the creation
of the world, but looking unto the wisdom, goodness, and power of God,
whereby the heart is moved to fear, reverence and submission. That faith,
Creation. Heb. 11.3.
which is deeply fastened in the heart, and beholds the true God the
creator and Governor of all things, as his power, bounty and understanding
shines in his works; that says inciteth to humility, reverence, love, and
worship of God. Through faith we understand that God has protected and
preserved and blessed his people from time to time; Providence.
afflicted them when they went astray, delivered them out of the hands of their
persecutors when they humbled themselves and sought unto him, inclined the
hearts of their enemies to show them favor confounded those that rose up
against them, and mercifully performed all his promises in the fittest season:
and where this firm belief is planted it begets a constant and
well-aduised resolution to draw near to God, and cleave to him in all
conditions, prosperity and and adversity, sickness and health, freedom and
trouble, when religion is favored and when it is persecuted: because salvation
is of the Lord, Psalm. 73, 24 27.
he will guide his people by counsel, and afterward receive them to glory,
but they that are far from God shall perish, they that go a whoring from him
shall be destroyed. Man's misery by sin.
What the Scripture teaches of the misery of all men by sin, the vanity of
Mind, and corruption of nature, that faith receives, and thence follows
self-denial and renunciation of all trust in worldly means. The H gh and
profound mysteries of godliness, Mysteries of godliness.
which the natural man perceives not, accounts foolishenes, faith imbraceth
with admiration, joy, delight, and affection answereable to the nature of the
doctrine into which we are deliuerd. Belief of Gods power, wisdom, grace,
love and mercy manifested in Jesus Christ, does frame the image of God or
Christ in our minds, and proposes it as a vi^ible pattern for our imitation
in all our works, thoughts, and resolutions, and stirs up to works of
piety, justice, mercy, long suffering and the like.

. 4. Besides ^he promise of forgiveness of sins in and through the blood of
Christ,. 4. 2 The promises concerning.
there be many other precious and rich promises spiritual and temporal,
concerning this and the life to come: all which, as proceeding from the same
fountain of truth, faith does rest upon and embrace, and that so much the
faster, as the promises be more excellent. There is a mutual relation betwixt
God promising any good blessing in Christ, and the fai hfull soul putting
forth it self to embrace grace offe^ed. For faith has not only eyes, by which
it does see the good promised, but hands wherewith it does lay hold upon the
good things bestowed: and the more excellent the good, which is reached unto us
in the word of promise is, the closer does faith stick unto it, the stronger
does it hold it. Men are credulous in things that may concern them in their
name, goods or life: and the more weighty the matter, the more earnest they be
in seeking resolution, and the stronger hope or fear it begets in them. 2.
Cor. 1.20.
All the promises of God be yea and Amen, sure in themselves, certain to the
belieuer, and therefore he cannot but receive them with closer and stronger
repose and adherence, the more he does apprehend their goodness and worth.
Amongst the great and more principal promises those are to be reckoned,
Sanctification.
which God has made concerning our Sanctification by his holy Spirit, that he
will enable them that believe, to bring forth fruits of amendment, and perfect
the good work begun in them from day to day. This is the covenant which God
has made with his people; Ier. 32.40. Ezekiel. 36.26.27.
I will put my fear into their hearts, that they shall not depart from my
ways. This promise is very necessary to be believed; Phil. 1.6. 1. Cor. 1.8.
2. Tim. 1.12.
for if people be not well grounded in believing that God will build them up
more strongely from day to day, and perfect the good work in them which he
has begun, even to full sanctification in the fear of God, they shall very
much stagger and go back, coldly set upon the practice of godliness, be off
and on, now forward, now backward, not knowing how to begin or to proced in
the way of holiness. Belief that God will enable them to every duty he does
require, and strengthen them against enemies that do oppose, is a maine post
in the Christian building an exceeding furtherance unto godliness, without
which they shall be often shaken and dismayed. These promises be of great price:
for if a Christian were allowed to ask of God whatsoever he would, next unto
the pardon of his sins and salvation of his soul, what would he desire, but
to be assured from God that he will establish him in grace, and teach him the
good way which he ought to go; that he will sanctify him in soul, spirit
and body, and keep him blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus unto
judgment. And when he discerns any such promise to be made, it is not hard
to conceive, with what dear affection, and strong adherence he does receive
it, how close he lays it up in his soul, and sweetly feeds upon it. This
promise is sweet, and belief thereof stirring and operative: for it
hearteneth to the practice of mortification and new obedience with great
courage, chearefulnes and stayednes; it quickens and encourages to pray as
necessities shall give cause; it preserves from fainting and dismayednes, when
strength is not very great, and if at any time, through weakness and
infirmity, security catch hold upon us; says in the promise^, that God will
be our strength and help, is that which raises us again, and puts courage
into us to fight against the adversaries of our soul.

Things temporal.
Many gracious and free promises concerning the blessings of this life, are
dispersed in the Word of life, which faith receives as true and certain,
because they come from the God of Truth, Genesis ^5.5. ^os, 1.5. Heb. 13.5. 1.
Tim. 4.8. Romans ^.2.
who is faithful, sincere and constant in all his promises. Godliness has
the promises both of this life and that which is to com. He that spared not his
own Son, but delivered him up for us all: how shall he not with him also
freely give us all things? As health, maintenance, credit, prosperous success,
in our callings and lawful dealings, deliverance out of troubles, and such
like. This is the assurance that God has given, even his faithful promise
often repeated, many ways ratified and confirmed, that he will make competent
provision for his children: which is to faith better then many bills of
security from men, yea, then large possessions in hand for the present. The
worth and goodness of earthly blessings promised is apparent, specially when
they be given in love and mercy, as gifts of the covenant, tokens of free
grace, and by a supernatural providence elevated to spiritual use, in which
sense they are promised and vouchsased unto them that fear God and walk in
his ways. And therefore when the belieuer is rightly informed, that God has
made any such promises, he puts forth the hand of faith to lay fast hold
upon them, and boxeth them up safe as his best and only evidence for the things
of this life, and the sanctification of them. For want of this faith, many
virtuous and godly men are greatly staggered and perplexed, plunged into deep
uncomfortable dumps and ^edious troubles about the things of this life: But
when once these promises be well riuitted into, and have taken root in the
heart by a lively faith, belief hereof brings forth contentment, comfort
in the multitude of perplexities, encourages to diligence in our places,
quickens in adversities, and strengthens to the works of righteousness, as
knowing that to be the surest way for the gaining of durable riches, and
trusting more to the faithful prom ses of God though above likelihood, then to
their own carnal devices though in show and appearance probable.

. 5. As faith requires what God promises,. 5. 3. The threatenings.
because God is faithful, and the promises of great worth and goodness: so it
belieueth the threatenings denounced in the Word, not barely apprehending them
as true and certain, but also declining them as evil. For the whole Scripture
breathed from God and every part thereof is Gods Word, of infallible truth,
deserving absolute credit. God is as well just as merciful; faithful and true
as well in his threats, as in his promises, and equally to be believed in
both, so far as by his Word he has assured us of both. He that belieueth
the one as he ought, belieueth both: and he that belieueth not bo h, gives
sound credit to neither. Belief of the threatenings is necessary: Rom 15.4.
For whatsoever things are written (whether precepts, promises, threatenings,
examples) are written for our learning: and as the promises of thi^ life and
the life to come are sharp spurs to quicken us unto godliness: so the
threatenings are strong bridles to keep from naughtiness. Firm assent to the
certain accomplishment of divine threatenings, ^oth beget humiliation for sin
past, and vigilancie to sh^nne sin and escape danger: it strengthens against
base, carnal fears, and the threats of men that oppose the truth, and
reuiueth care to serve and please God at all t^mes and in all things. Wherefore
do the terrors of men so much affright, but because slight belief is given
^o the threatenings of the Lord? The grace and mercy of God believed breeds
love of God, and consequently ^rue fear, which is opposed to senseless
stupiditie and carnal presumption, though it casts out fear which
proceeds from unbelief. But what need Belieuers fear the threatenings,
seeing there is no condemnation or cause of fear to them that believe? The
Apostle says indeed there is no condemnation to such: Romans 8.1.
but we cannot therefore conclude, that there is no cause of fear to them,
unless no other evils, but final damnation need to be feared. But whilst the
soul is subject to bring upon it Gods temporary wrath, sicknesses spiritual;
hellish anguish to the sense of it, there is still cause enough to fea^e.
Seeing that concerning temporal threats and punishments God deals as
sharply, Amos 3.2. 2. Sam. 12, 14,
or rather more sharply with his children, then any other, why should they not
dread his Fatherly correction? Would a child that had but one spark of wit or
common reason provoke his Father to scourge and whip him every day, because he
knows he will not disinherit him in the end; and not rather say, it is good
sleeping in a whole skin? And shall belieuers who are spiritually wise,
willingly provoke God, because he will not condemn them eternally? The
assurance which a godly man has of his salvation, is ever joined with a
faithull and conscionable care to walk uprightly before the Lord, and to
decline bypath and strayings; for which end he makes use of every part of
the word. Romans 8.1.
There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Moreover, there may be fear of that
which a man is infallibly assured to escape, not a distrustful fear of
falling into it, but a watchful fear of shunning and shrinking all means
leading thereunto.

. 6. ^. Commandments. Titus 2.11, 13.
. 6. The word of grace, which calls upon us to believe the free mercy of God
in Christ to the pardon of our offenses, teaches us to deny ungodliness and
worldly lusts, and to live godly, justly, soberly in this present evil world:
and this word of grace is the matter of faith, which is wholly received, if any
part take good rooting. For the precepts of sanctity and holiness bind the
conscience to obey God, as well as the promises bind to trust in God. What God
has linked together, faith will not separate: But God has coupled mercy and
obedience, grace and holiness. He cannot believe or make faithful plea to
the promises of remission and salvation, who does not make conscience of all
sound doctrine that he hears, and give free, unlimited assent to every part
of Gods Word, submitting himself to be led by it, and that because it is his
Word. Faith sets the Image of God upon the heart, which is manifested in the
several branches of holiness and righteousness which he commands in his Word:
and it resigneth a man unto God to live not unto the world, not unto the lusts
of the flesh, but unto the praise of his Name, which is not possible to be
done, if he cleave not unto the Commandments as just, equal, honest and
good, in all things and at all times to be obeyed. Faith cannot take and
leave, yield and withold assent at pleasure, part and mangle, divide with
times, seasons, and private respects; or resign it self to God, with
limitation to have leave in this or that to live at pleasure: but it is
downright for God, and willingly receives whatsoever he says; what God
approves, that is pleasing to faith, though cross to age, education, custom,
credit, honor, natural desire and inclination: what God condemns, that
faith disalloweth, though never so much countenanced by authority, graced by
example, attended upon with honor, dignity, preferment, and suting to our
disposition. Faith subdueth the strongest passions as well, (and if due and
right comparison be made) as much as the weakest, and acknowledging the
Goodness, Mercy, and absolute Soueraignetie of the Lord, yields it self to
be led by him, above all things that can oppose themselves, and will not give
place to ought that does set against him. Genesis 12.1, 4.
If God bid Abraham leave all, his friends, his Fathers house, the land of his
Nativity, to go into a strange country, he is straight upon his journey,
without further questioning he will be gone, Genesis 22.2, 3.
no entreaty will stay him in Mesopotamia. If God comm^nd him to offer his
only Son in sacrifice, he is ea^ly up to do it. The faithful soul gives
firm and free assent unto all things revealed by God, eagerly fixes the
affiance of heart upon the promises, and cleaves close unto the Commandments,
not only such as suite wi^h his disposition, education, age, but even those
that directly cross and oppose carnal reason, carnal affections, worldly
pleasures, and what prouocations soever there be in the world unto sin: and
not then alone when it may be done without contradiction or resistance, but hen
specially when temptations rise, humane reason fails, sinful lusts hale this
way and that, Satan rages, the world frowns or flatters, our preferment,
credit, honor, life, all lies at stake. In this case, faith looks directly
nto God, and judges it best to stick unto him, from whom comes salvation. For
no good can be equal to that which God promises, no evil so great as what
he threatens, no course so safe as what he prescribes, no evidence so sure as
the truth of God, no command so just as what God requires; the greatest gain
is to loose all for Christ's sake if we be called the^eunto; we should stand so
affected to the glory of God as to shrink in no trial though never so
difficult, Heb. 12.4.
nor think it much to r^sist unto blood, striving against sin: This is the
constant certain iudg^ment of faith, which brings forth a settled resolution
to follow the Lord at all times, and in all things, In particular practices the
faithful may fail. 1. Sam. 27.1. Psalm. 116.^1. Mat. 26.70, 72, 74.
notwithstanding all opposition.

In particular practice, the faithful soul may be ignorant of some things,
and weak in the application of others: David in a passion may think, Samuel
has deceived him: and Peter surprised with bodily fear may deny his master:
but the constant temper of the belieuer is much better; and if by some
unexpected occasion he be unsettled, he is never quiet, until his former
resolution be confirmed, and put in practice. For having we ghed and pondered
all things in an even balance, he is assuredly persuaded, that no outwar^
evil can come in comparison with Gods anger, no earthly good is to be matched
with Gods favor, that transitory delights a^e dear bought if a man endanger
his soul to compass them; that the sufferings of this l fe are not worthy to
be compared with the glory that shall be revealed: and therefore it is
infinitely better to cleave unto God, though in reproaches, bands,
imprisonment, or death, Heb. 11.25.
then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.

. 7. And seeing faith kindly rooted does spread it self to every branch of
divine truth,. 7. The obedience of faith is uniform, entire and constant.
cleaving inseperably to the whole, and with closest repose of heart to that
which is most excellent and of greatest impo^tance, the obedience which faith
produces, and the work which it animateth, must be entire, uniforme, and
constant. Entire not in degree, but in the branches of obedience. Maimed
obedience to some duties of the law, lopping off other branches, which accord
not with our state, humor and disposition, or gross^ly neglecting them, though
no less commanded, is an argument of an unsound and imp rfect root whence it
spr^ngeth. The practice of some one or few Christian duties, joined with the
extreme neglect of others no less excellent, and necessary, is no token of
faith, but a strong presumption that what good is done, proceeds from
indulgence to corruption. For i^ we give our selves to the prosequution of
some good works, because we receive and embrace the word which commands them,
then shall we give our selves to the performance of every good work, which the
same word does call for at ou hands: If we do this or that good work
commanded, because it is suitable to our disposition, passing over others that
be cross thereunto, we obey not the Lord, but please our selves. The Word of
God does work effectually as it is embrac^d, and the consideration of what
Christ has done for us, will bring for^h in us the same mind that was in him,
a mind to do his Fathers will in every point alike sincerely, but with
greater intentions, fervor and cheerfulness, as the weightinesse of the
duty, or opportunity and season shall require. For true faith assenteth to
every divine truth as certain and infallible, cleaves to every promise and
commandment alike sincerely and unfeignedly, sticks fastest to them that be
of greatest worth, and necessity, or upon special occasion may most tend to
the glory of God, the comfort of the soul, and good of our brethren; and so
teaches the affections to rise and fall, swell and assuage whether in
admiration or detestation, in embracing or loathing, and to put themselves
forth in practice, according to the different excellency or indignity,
goodness or vileness of objects presented to them. It teaches us absolutely
and entirely to submit our wills unto Gods will; to affect whatsoever he
approues, to hate whatsoever he disallowes, to love that best which his Word
assures us to be most excellent and dear to him, and to detest that most,
which is most odious and abominable in his sight, though otherwise pleasant to
our natural disposition, or not so distasteful as many other matters would be;
did we take care for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof. Indeed the
faithful soul may find it self more prone to one sin then another, and
more dull to some good duties then other by reason of natural inclination,
state of life, custom, or some other occasion: but, if right comparison be
made, faith inciteth to hate all sin and to affect all duties of holiness
one as well as another. A man sick of diverse diseases but one predominant, may
be cured of it as much as of any of the rest, and yet be more troubled with the
remainders of it, because it had deepest root and greatest head: and so every
member of corruption may, be truly mortified, and yet the stronger passions
before, though in proportionable degree tamed and brought into subjection as
much as the rest, may be the most troublesome: which the faithful do
ackowledge, bewail, and endeavor to redress keeping them under with greatest
care, and striving against them with all earnestnes. This fight against
corruption is constantly main^ained by faith, and constantly it cleaves to the
word of grace as much better then all carnal or worldly allurements, whereby
we might be drawn aside into sin, and so it brings forth constant
obedience to the will of God. The good ground, are they, which with an honest
and good heart having heard the word, keep^ it, and bring forth fruit with
patience. Luke 8.15.


CHAP. VI.
Of the Special object of Justifying. Faith.

. 1. FAith seeks not life and salvation in the threatenings,. 1. The Special
object of Justifying faith.
prohibitions or commandments, though it work by love, and earnestly contend
against corruption: but acknowledging its imperfection in working, 2. Cor.
5.19. Romans 15.25.26. Romans 10.8 and 1 17.
and renouncing all confidence in works or in our selves, it rests upon the
promises of mercy in Jesus Christ, or word of reconciliation, which is called
the word of faith. The more firm and lively our faith is, the more sincerely
it works the better we discern and unfeignedly acknowledge our
imperfections, and disclaim all affyance in our own righteousness and the
more faithfully we renounce all confidence in our works, the more earnestly
we seek for salvation only by Christ. Faith rests upon Christ as Mediator
or as God and Man obeying to the cursed of of the cross, that from the grace o
God we^ might obtain pardon of sin, and be accepted as righteous unto life.
For this we are always s ^o have in Mind, that Christ is the object of fai h
not abstractly and nakedly considered, but Christ with his benefits, Christ
lifted up as the brason serpent, Christ set forth as a propitiatory sacrifice
for our sins, Christ as our redeemer from sin and death, Christ as he is
set forth to the belieuer: and thus to receive Christ and believe on him, is to
believe and receive in him ransom from sin and death. Mark. 1.15. Act.
20.24. Luke 24.47. 1. Pet. 1.21. 2. Cor 5.19.20. Psalm. 32 5. and 51.1.2. and
103.3. Dan. 9 17. Hos. 14.3. and 2.19.20. Luke 1.71. and 18.19. Act. 15.11.
Christ and his Apostles testify that this is specially to be pre^^hed, viz
remission of sins in and through Jesus Christ: This the faith of all the
Sain^s, [through it have respected every part of the word] has in special
manner respected, craved, embraced. But that which is specially to be preached
and believed, that which the faith of all the Saints has always in special
manner respected, desired, craved, and obtained, that is the special object of
Justifying faith. If at any time we read, Genesis 15.6.
that the belief of a temporary promise was accounted for righteousness, it
is, because it does in believing the thing temporal, apprehend him Gal. 3.8.16.
in whom all the promises are yea and Amen: who is at least the removed object
of justifying faith in every thing it apprehends. Thus Abraham believing the
promise of seed, did apprehend that blessed seed which had from the beginning
been promised, John 8.56.
and saw his day. Neither did he look at the power of God, but to sustain his
belief of a seed before promised, against the temptations wherewith he w s
exercised. Express mention of the special mercy of God we find not in the
sermons of the Apostles: but it does evidently follow of those things which are
preached by them. For remission Ps. 103.3.13. and 130.3.4. Mic. 7.19. Titus 3 5.
of sins does presuppose the mercy of God, and the special subject of their
preahing Act. 2.38. and 4.1^. and 10.43 and 1^. 39. and 8.37.
is remission of sins by and for the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
That which first pricketh and spurreth the soul to Christ, that gives us to
understand what the soul principally reaches at, and receives in Christ. But
sin and death urge the soul for mercy and life to be obtained prick and
spur the soul to go forth of it self and receive Christ and rest upon him,
as he is offered in the Gospel: Popish objections answered.
Therefore it principally lays hold on the free promise of mercy covering
sin and delivering from death. The confession of Peter and the rest of the
Apostles [for he made answer for them all, Math. 16.16. Ioh 6 68. Belar. de
Iustif. l. 1. chap. 8.
as the question was propounded to them all] was no more in words, but of
Christ's office, Thou art Christ; and his nature, The son of the living God.
But shall we think the faith of the Apostles, to b^e nothing but a bare
assent of Mind to that which they professed of Christ? Th^n shall we make the
Devil himself to be as good and true a belieuer as the Apostles; for he
professed as much, O Jesus of Nazaret, Mar. 1.24. Luke 4.34.
I know who thou art, etc. Noe doubt the Apostles rested upon Christ for
salvation, and believed in him to be that to their souls, and for their use
and comfort, which they believed him to be. The subject matter of their faith
in that point was, that Jesus was the Christ: the manner of believing was with
the heart relying upon him for salvation. The faith of Abraham, was not a bare
assent given to the promise of God, but a confidenec in the special mercy of
God: for he rested upon the p^omise, not only in regard of his posterity,
but also in regard of Christ, according to that which is said: In thy seed
shall all nations of the earth be blessed: which seed the Apostle teaches to
be Christ, Gal. 3.16.
and the blessing he interprets to be redemption from the curse of the law,
and justification by faith. Gal. 3.8.
Abraham then believing the remission of sins in and through Jesus Christ of
necessity it will follow, that his faith was directed unto and exercised about
the special mercy of God in Jesus Christ. How then does the Apostle set out
Abraham's full belief in this, that he was assured that he who had promised
was able also to do it? Romans 4.21. Bellarm. vbi supra. Rhem. annot in Romans
4.14. Sect. 10.
Not because Abraham's faith did justify him as he did believe the power of
God; but because his justifying faith which was fixed upon the gracious
promise, did sustain it self by the consideration of Gods power in time of
trial between the promise and the execution. Abraham had a promise of seed;
but the execution is deserrod, whereupon his faith is assailed thus: Abraham
thy body is dead, thy wife hopeless that way which things foiled Sarah for a
time. Now when Abraham's faith on the promises is thus set upon, Romans 4.2^.
against these arguments of unbelief, faith opposes the alsufficient power of
God, and sustaineth it self with this consideration, God is able. As another
time, when he was tempted to offer up his son in sacrifice, he verily
believed he should receive him again, Heb. 11.19.
because God was able to raise him up again. Belief of Gods power is not the
act of justifying faith, as it iustifies, but the consideration of Gods power
is a prop and stay to faith against manifold temptations. And so we shall
find, the Almighty power of God often aledged to confirm the weak and
wavering heart. As for Sarahs laughing, thinking it impossible to have a
child, the Lord said to Abraham, Genesis 8.14.
Is any thing hard or impossible to God. And again to Moses obiecting, whether
all the fish in the sea should be gathered for food for Israel in the
wilderness; The Lord answered, Is the Lords hand waxed short, Number. 11.23.
thou shall see whether my word shall come to pass or not. And to the virgin
Mary desiring to be further conformed touching the promise of God, the Angel
makes answer, Luke 1.37.
with God nothing is impossible. As for the faith of the Centurion so much
commended by our S^uiour Christ, Luke 7.9.
it might be a step or mean by which he was raised of God to a true faith
for justification by the Messiah; or it may be, it was some effect of a
justifying faith: but in it self, as he did only believe the power of Christ
to heal his servant, it did not justify. Our Adversaries themselves will not
say that naked assent to this truth, that Christ by his bare word was of power
to cure his servant absent, is sufficient to justification, which yet is the
substance of his confessiion. If they answer that the profession of his faith
is here mentioned according to the present occasion: They must withal confess
it follows not, that because none other act of his faith is here expressed,
therefore there was nothing further in his faith unto justification before God.
Surely if he be believed to salvation, he believed somewhat else that made him
to believe what is here noted: he believed some what else, that made him to
say, Luke. 7.6.
Lord I am not worthy that thou should enter under my roof. Christ is every
where made the thing which faith embraces to salvation, and whom it does look
unto and respect, as it does make us righteous in the sight of God. God so
loved the world, John 3.16.
that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever belieueth in him should
not perish, but have everlasting life. John 11.25.
I am the resurrection and the life he that belieueth in me, though he were
dead yet shall he live. And by him all that believe, Act. 13.39.
are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the
law of Moses. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, Act. 16.31.
and thou shall be saved, and thy house. That they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in
me. Act. 26.18.
Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Jesus
Christ: whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood
for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. Romans
3.25.26. Ephesians. 1.15. Act. 15.11. John 1.12. Gal. 3.26.
It is with us as with malefactors; the kings pardon only received does acquit
them, and restore them to liberty: and Gods mercy in Christ covering sin
received by a lively faith, does set us free from fear of damnation. It is
true, that justifying faith does give assent to every article of faith and
cleave to every Commandment: but it obtains remission of sins, as it
receives Gods pardon in Christ. To him give all the Prophets witness, that
through his Name, Acts 10.43.
whosoever belieueth in him, shall receive remission of sins. Righteousness
is eue^y where tied unto faith, even to faith in Christ, whom only it does and
can look unto as it justifies. I count all things but loss, Romans 3.22. and
10.4. Phil. 3.8, 9.
for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have
counted all things loss, and do judge them to be dung that I might win
Christ. And might be found in him, that is, not having mine own
righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, the righteousness which is of God through faith. For look as nothing
in a poor man can make him rich, further then it does get riches into his
possession; so nothing in us sinners can make us righteous to life, further
then it does lay hold on such a righteousness, which can take away sin, and
make v^ righteous to the receiving of life eternal. Faith is c^lled the faith
of Christ, Gal. 2.16.
because Christ is he whom faith does apprehend and receive to righteousness
and life, according to that of the Evangelist; John ^.36. 1. John 3.12, 13
He that belieueth on the Son of God has life everlasting. That is the
principal object of faith, for which embraced and received by faith, eternal
life is given from grace. Ioh. 6, 47. and 17.3.
But eternal life is given of grace for Christ embraced or rested upon by
Faith. To. 10.10, 11. Romans ^.9. 1. Cor. 15.3.
To believe Christ dead and risen, as the Apostles taught him, is true belief:
but that is not barely to believe the history of his Death and Resurrection,
but the fruits and benefits thereof, and that wi^h the affiance. It is so to
believe the Death and Resurrrection of Christ, as thereby to look for
forgiveness of sins: which is to put our trust in the special mercy of God
through Jesus Christ. This is plain by the words of Martha; for when Christ
asked her, John 11.26, 27.
Do thou believe this, that whosoever belieueth on me shall not die
everlastingly; She answers, yea Lord, I believe that thou art Christ: that
is, I cannot doubt, but that those that cleave to thee shall have life
everlasting, teaching that these confessions imply an affiance and trust of all
good through him. The Eu^uch his profession was, Acts 8.38.
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God: but the faith of this Eunuch
wa^ a particular confidence of heart, whereby he embraced Christ his Savior;
and believed on him for his particular benefit and comfort. Nathanael professed
of Christ, John 1.49 50.
that he was the King of Israel, that he was the son of God, and so much in
general the Deuil^ believe and know: Mark 5.7. Luke 8.28.
was Nathanaels faith nothing but a bare persuasion that Christ was the Son
of God? yet it was a persuasion joined with affiance, for he rested upon him,
and so belieue^ the promise of mercy in him. God has raised up Christ to be
a Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel, Acts ^.21. Romans 8.34.
and forgiveness of sins: and to believe Christ a Prince and S^uiour raised
from the dead, and set at the right hand of the Father, does imply trust and
affiance in him for forgiveness of sins and life everlasting through the
grace of God.

. 2. It is objected,. 2.
that to believe the power of God is Iust^fying faith: for our Savior required
no more of the blind man, Math. 9.27, 28.
then to believe that he was able to heal him. And the Leper seems to doubt
of his will, Mark 1.40. Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 8.
but wa^ well persuaded of his power. But it is one thing to look unto Christ
for bodily health, or to receive a temporal blessing: another to believe in
him to Justification. For the faith which Christ requires to Justification, is
such a faith as does acquit us from our sins, and does procure us
righteousness: But many were healed by our Savior, that (for ought can be
proved) were not acquitted from their sins. And if these blin^e men had only
believed that he was able to ^ure the malady of their eyes, notwithstanding
this their faith, their souls had been uncured, their sins uncovered. Many
that were cured of their bodily infirmities, were also healed of their
spiritual diseases: not because they believed his power to help them, but
because they relied upon him as their only Savior.

And the testimony it self shows, that the blind men believed Christ to be
the Messiah in times past promised of the Father, and now exhibited: so that
they might believe to justification, Heb. 11.33, 34, 35.
but their belief of his omnipotency did not justify them. The writer to the
Hebrews shows in diverse examples, that by Justifying faith some subdued
Kingdoms, other some stopped the mouths of Lions, certain quenched the force
of fire, others escaped the edge of the sword, etc. All which things, (though
temporal) were achieved by Justifying faith: which is the hand of the people
of God to receive good by: but faith justified not, as it was occupied about,
or looked unto these things, but as it was carried to an higher object. The
healing of corporal diseases was a seal unto us, Isay 53.4. Math. 8.17.
that Christ is our deliverer from sin and death, (as the Scriptures
testify, and our Adversaries confess) and therefore in believing the mercy
of God toward them in healing of their diseases, they might forthwith
conceive, that of his free grace he would be pleased to forgive their sins,
which are the true causes of all our maladies.

Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap. 9.
It is again objected, that in the Creed is contained the whole object of
Justifying faith: But in it there is no mention of the special mercy of God.
In this objection there is a twofold mistaking; for in the Creed is contained
the object of faith which is believed, that is, the sum of doctrine to be
believed to salvation is there explained: But here we speak of the object of
Justifying faith, by which we believe. The doctrine of faith is one thing, the
private act of the heart relying upon the promises of mercy another. Now when
we enquire, what is the object of Justifying faith, the question is not what is
the sum of faith, or of the articles to be believed, but what the faith of
the heart in all these articles which it belieueth, does first and principally
look unto, rest upon, and receive to salvation. For when all Christians
profess and historically believe all the Articles of the Christian faith; yet
many are not justified or saved, because they believe not as they ought: whence
it is evident, that b^re assent to the Articles of Religion, is not that faith
which justify, or s^ues, but another of far different nature is required, if
we would be pertake^s of these blessings. Again, verbal mention of Gods
special mercy there is not any in the Creed, but really it is in^luded. For
to believe in God, is to depend upon his mercy reaching to the pardon of our
offenses. Ier. 31.33. Esaias 25.9. and 33.22.
To believe in Christ is to rely upon him as the author of redemption,
reconciliation, and peace with God: which does necessarily imply the special
mercy of God. And in the Creed we believe the remission of sins, which
article cannot be explained according to the doctrine of the Gospel, without
belief in the special mercy of God, and confidence thereon. The conclusion
is, The Word of God is the general object of Justifying f ith, the special
promises of mercy and forgiveness in Christ Jesus, is the special object of
faith as it justifies.

. 3. This belief in the rich mercy of God, frames the Image of God in our
hearts,. 3. Faith in Gods special mercy, frames his Image in the Heart.
and imprinteth the virtues of Christ's death upon the soul, as by application
the seal does set it stamp upon the wax. A man cannot walk in the Sun,
but he must bear it hue: no more can he believe in the grace and mercy of God
to the pardon of his offenses, but he must bear the Image of Gods mercy upon
his soul. And so faith in Christ, does incite to the uniform studious
practice of piety toward God, who of his gracious, free, undeserved love and
mercy is pleased to repute Belieuers as his Sons by adoption, and compass
them with his favors; and of mercy, kindness, long-suffering, forbearance;
forgiveness toward men, looking to God for it pattern, whom it must and
ought to follow. The Belieuer cannot put on Christ as a Iustifier, but he must
put on the bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
long-suffering, forbearance, etc. and the closer he puts on Christ unto
righteousness, the mo^e quick and operative be these graces of the Spirit,
and more lively the operations themselves that issue from the^, as quickened and
animated by that faith.

CHAP. VII.
Justifying faith is a particular and certain confidence, resting upon the
mercy of God in Christ for pardon and forgiveness, not an assured persuasion
that our sins be already pardon d and forgiven.

. 1. Iustifyi g f ith is a particular and certain confidence.
. 1 Just fying faith does not only believe the promise of mercy in general;
as that there is fo^giuenes for them that lay hold upon it: but it relieth upon
the promise for our own particular, and d^pends wholly thereupon, looking
after no other help. For trust or confidence imports the application of some
good to him, that trusts: and so he that casts himself upon the promises
of mercy, draws near unto Christ, throws himself into his arms, and
graspes about him with all his might. Look how the poor Infant affrighted
with the apprehension of some danger, clinges close to the parent for succor
and defense: or a man in danger of drowning lays hold upon some willow that
grows upon the bank, and hangs thereon for safety: so does the soul pursued
by the terrors of the Law, and affrighted with the ugly sight of sin, fly
with speed unto Jesus Christ as he is held forth in the Gospel hang upon him,
and to die for it will never loose his hold. For in him it apprehends
plentiful redemption, and out of him it knows no succor is to be ^ound. In
this sense, faith applies the promise of grace to a man's self in particular,
that is, it particularly relieth upon the grace of God in Jesus Christ to
obtain pardon and forgiveness. Numb. 21.9. John 3.14, 15.
Even as they that were stung with the fiery Serpents, did come and look to
the brazen Serpent, believing to find the healing of those deadly stings that
were fastened in them: Thus a soul stung with sin and fear of damnation,
comes by faith to Christ, relying on him, trusting to find in and through
him, cure of those deadly evils wherewith it is wounded.

If a Prince should offer a general pardon to Rebels, causing it to be
proclaimed, that if they would lay down arms, submit themselves and fly to
his mercy, they should be received to favor, and we should see many
hereupon cast down their weapons, and sue for mercy, would we not presently
know, that they believed the promise, that they should be pardoned: So when
Christ says to sinners, come unto me, or believe on me, and I will ease you,
what faith (think we) have sinners, who resort unto him? Is it not a belief,
that he will (according to his word) deliver them from sin and death, and
restore them to life eternal? If there be a particular word, or that which is
equivalent then there is a particular faith. But there is a particular word, or
that which is equivalent. For the thirsty, and barren soul, that is stung
with the terrors of the Law; they, that labor and are heavy laden, Math.
11.28. Esaias 55.1, 2. 1. John 3.24. John 3.16.36. Acts 10.43. and 13.39. Romans
10.9, 10.
are invited to come unto Ch is it, and exhorted, entreated, persuaded, commanded
to believe; and the promise is, Whosoever belieueth in him, shall not perish,
but have everlasting life: which is as much as Thomas thou art burdened and
do labor, thou art weary and thirsty, come thou unto me, behold, I
inuit; believe thou, for unto thee do I reach forth the promise of mercy,
receive it, and thou shall ^iue. For the particulars are ever in their
generals. How can we prove, Gal. 3.10.
that John or James are by nature under wrath and the curse? otherwise it
cannot be proved then thus, Cursed is every one that continues not in all
things, that are w^itten in the book of the Law to do them. How can we prove
that Thomas or Peter are bound to love the Lord, and to abstain from murder,
fornication, theft; but because it is said to all men, Thou shall love the
Lord, Thou shall not steal? Deuteronomy 6.5. John 7.37.
etc. And thus it is said to all, Let every one that is a thirst come unto me,
and drink, Believe in the Lord Jesus, Acts 16, 31.
and thou shall be saved: whence every thirsty and burdened soul may
conclude, I ought to b^lieue, God calls and commands me to believe; he has
given me his promise, and offers mercy, and believing I shall be saved. The
faith of true Belieuers goes further then the faith of Devils can do. But
they may, and do believe or know, that Christ died in general for sinners,
and that they shall be saved who believe in him. If Justifying faith have not
in it some particular confidence, then it is not opposed to despair, so as to
expel it. For things that will not endure the one the other, most have
contrariety; as fire and water: if the one do not fight and drive forth the
other, then may they dwell together. But true faith and utter desperation
cannot stand together, James 1.6. Math. 6.30. and 1^.31. Romans 4.20. Heb. 10 2^.
but do expel each other. Moreover true faith in Christ does breed confidence
and boldness, according to that, Let us enter with confidence and boldness
through faith on him. True faith therefore has in it particular confidence in
the grace of God. For as nothing can make hot, which h^th not heat in it
self: ^o can nothing make confident, which after some manner has not
confidence in it. To Math. 1.20. and 2.20. John 17.8.
receive is to take in particular to a man's self, or to apprehend and lay hold
of for conueying a thing to himself. But to John 1.12. Col. 2 6. Romans 5.11.17.
Heb. 8.15.
believe on Christ and to receive Christ do both import the same thing.
Therefore to believe on Christ, is to rest upon him for the conueying of his
benefits particularly unto us. Meat nourishes not unless it be eaten and
digested: a plaster heales not, if it be not applied: a potion will not worke'
if it be not received. Christ is the true bread of life, John 6.35.
that came down from Heaven, upon whom we must feed by faith, if we would be
pertakers of his benefits: and feed upon him we cannot, if we do not
particularly believe in him for our selves. The work of redemption remains
proper to Christ: but the benefit of his death is communicated to every member
of his mystical body for their justification: And how can we hope to have
our sins forgiven, if we be not made one with him by faith? and rest upon the
promise made in him for pardon? That profession which Paul makes, may here be
considered; I know in whom I have believed, 2. Tim. 1.12.
and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that thing wherewith I have
entrusted him, or delivered up to his keeping: where it is apparent, that to
believe is to commit our selves to Christ's trust or keeping, or to rest our
souls upon the performance of the gracious promises, which God of his rich
grace in Jesus Christ has made unto us.

. 2. This faith is certain,. 2. Faith is certain in the event, not ever in
sense.
though mixed with many doubtings by reason of our weakness: Certain and
assured in regard of the event and thing believed, not in regard of the sense
and feeling of him who belieueth. Whether his heart be steadfast in faith, or
trembling through much unbelief, yet unfeignedly believing with a welrooted
confidence (though with much unbelief) he shall be sure of the thing promised.
For the promise is made good to him that truly receives it, not for the
steadfast manner of receiving, but for the thing received, which is Christ. Now
look as a trembling palsy hand may take the same thing, which a more steddie
one does take, though the manner be diverse, the one taking it with shaking, the
other without any trembling: so an heart of faith, which yet shakes and
doubts through much unbelief, may take Christ, as well as an heart does,
which is more fully persuaded: and therefore shall have the grace promised for
his sake, who is received by faith. John 3.15.
The promise is universal, Whosoever belieueth in Christ shall not perish, but
have everlasting life: it is not, whosoever is fully assured or certainly
persuaded of his salvation, but whosoever unfeignedly bel^eueth in Christ, shall
be saved. Now many a poor soul may cast himself upon Christ, and lay hold
upon him with purpose through Gods grace never to leave him, as being assured
without wavering in this particular, that it is best both simply and in
comparison to draw near unto God, and rely upon his grace; and so in event is
sure of salvation, who yet would give a world to be assured of Gods favor, and
fully persuaded that his sins are pardoned. An house well builded upon a
rock is as sure as the foundation: every thing hanging on a pin or pegg is as
sure as the pin or pegg on which it hangs: True faith firmly groundeth it
self upon the faithful promises of God, and receives them as better then
life it self, from which it will not be with-drawne by any carnal
allurements: and therefore in event it cannot miscarrie, for the ground is
firm and unchangeable. The truth of God in it self is more certain then any
thing that can be apprehended by the senses but it is not evermore so
apprehended by us: and faith which builds upon the infallible truth of God,
coming to him when he calls, relying upon his grace, because he has
spoken, is in event no less sure, then the foundation upon which it leans is
certain and immovable, but in the sense of the belieuer it is not always so,
neither are matters of faith received by us with such certainty, as are other
things subject to the senses, in themselves less certain. Things are to us
according as we conceive them, which is not ever answerable to the evidence of
the thing in it self, or to the certainty in regard of the event. Things most
sure in themselves are sometimes but dimmely discerned of us, because our
eyesight is imperfect: and things less evident in themselves do appear to
us most clear and manifest, when they come within the compass of sense or
reason remaining in us. Besides, the promises of mercy in Christ being the
highest and most spiritual, it is the hardest point of service in Christian
warfare firmly to believe them: and the da^ly weaknesses which we epsy in our
selves, the many and strong passions which still war within us, and many times
prevail, do impell the mind to distrust. When a Christian calls to mind
what strength worldly allurements have in him, how often he yeildeth unto
assaults in many petty temptations, how weak and frail, dull and negligent
he is in the duties of Christianity and his particular calling: the
consciousnesse of these things will, no question, trouble the eye of faith. Not
that the comfort of a Christian is grounded upon his strength of grace or any
good work that is or can be done by him: but because his belief in the mercy
of God cannot be greater then his strength to overcome worldly allurements,
whereby he might be withdrawn from God, or care to yield uniform, sincere and
constant obedience to all Gods Commandments. Again, it is one thing to have a
thing surely, another thing to know I have it surely. We seek many things that
we have in our hands: we have many things that we think we have lost: so a
Belieuer, who has a sure belief, yet does not always know that he so
belieueth, seeks but finds it not; nay, thinks he is altogether without
faith, when he has it unfeignedly. A man unregenerate that is wholly corrupt
sees little or no corruption in himself: yea, after due, serious and long
examination many disorders may secretly lurk in the heart of a man sanctified,
which he does not epsy: And is it then any marvel, that a true Belieuer
should be unable (sometimes at least) to say that he does believe? yea, that
he should not find it, though he make diligent search and inquiry into his
own heart about it. Look as children live in the womb, and know not
themselves, that they do live: so it is with many true believing souls, who
long believe, before they come to see themselves believe, and be able by a
reflexed operation of mind to say, 2. Tim. 1.11.
I know on whom I have believed. A man of a contrite spirit, believing that h s
sins are pardonable, earnestly desiring remission of sins by the merits of
Christ, and resting upon Christ alone for salvation, assuredly he receives
forgiveness, ^lthough he be vexed with scruples and temptations, and want the
assurance and persuasion in himself that his sins be remitted. For faith is
necessary to salvation: but full assurance that I do believe in that sort, is
not of l^ke necessity. And if a man may believe unfeignedly, who is not fully
assured that he does so believe, then faith may be certain in the event, when
it is not certain to the sense of the Belieuer.

. 3. But what faith is necessary, to wit, on man's part to Justification? Is it
an assured persuasion of our particular election, or that our sins be already
pardoned and forgiven? No: It is one thing to rest on Christ obeying to the
cursed death of the Cross, that I may obtain pardon and life everlasting from
the grace of God, which is the act of true belief, required to Justification:
another to believe that I am one of Gods particular elect people, and that my
sins are pardoned and done away: which is a privilege of grace granted to
him who belieueth, is sealed by the Spirit, and knows assuredly that he
belieueth. It is not an action of Christian faith preuious or fundamental to
Justification, for a man to believe himself to be one of Gods elect: for we
come to know our election by the effects thereof, as Faith, Justification,
Sanctification. We must first read the effects of Gods love in our hearts,
and see that he has wrought in us the saving graces of faith, love, hope,
fear, etc. and sealed us by the spirit of promise, before we can come to know
his eternal decree and purpose toward us: therefore the belief of our
particular election is an act of faith following Justification, not precedent
to it. No man is justified by believing himself to be Just, nor pardoned,
Gallican. conf. art. 20. Belgic. confess. art. 23. Bolton walking with God, page
320. Pemble, plea for Grace, page 258. 259. 260. Rolloc de Iustificat. Heming.

by believing that he is pardoned: but if his belief be true, he must be truly
Just, before he can or ought to believe himself to be Just, and actually
pardoned, before he can be assured that he is pardoned. This is the order of
spiritual blessings conferred upon us in Christ, Faith is the band whereby we
are united unto Christ: after Union follows Communion with him:
Justification, Adoption, Sanctification, be the benefits and fruits of
Communion: Being made sons by faith, God sends forth the Spirit of his Son
into our hearts, crying, Abba Father; and this Spirit bears witness with our
spirit, that we are the children of God; assurance or certain persuasion that
our sins be pardoned, follows this witness of the Spirit, as the fruit and
effect thereof. In which it is most manifest, that faith in Christ is before
Justification in order of nature, though not in time; and Justification is
precedent to the sense and feeling of remission: and therefore that belief
which is required on our part to Justification cannot be an assurance that our
sins be pardoned already, unless the same thing be before and after it self,
and a man be pardoned before he believe, or assured that he is pardoned, before
it be granted, or that act of faith which cannot be but in a person already
justified, must go before the pardon of sin. Esa. 1.16, 17, 18 Ezekiel. 18.^1.
Prou. 28.13. Math. 6.14, 15. Acts 16.30, 31. John 6.29. and 11.25. Acts 10.43.
Acts 16.18.
The promise of remission of sins is conditional, and becomes not
absolute, until the condition be fulfilled, either actually or in desire and
preparation of mind. This is the word of grace, Believe in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and thou shall be saved: when does this conditional proposition
become absolute? when we believe? What? that our sins are pardoned: No: but
when we believe in Christ to obtain pardon; which is the thing promised upon
condition of belief. Assurance that our sins be pardoned is concluded in a
practical Syllogism thus; He that truly belieueth in Christ has obtained
pardon of his sins: But I believe: Therefore my sins are pardoned: where
assurance of the pardon of sin is a conclusion drawn from a twofold ground,
the one expressed in Scripture, the other evident (if true) by the testimony
of the renewed conscience, and presupposes that he belieueth, and is assured
that he does believe. Now if assurance of remission be concluded from this
ground, that he belieueth, and knows certainly that he belieueth, then the
belief which is required on our parts to Justification cannot be an assurance
that our sins be washed away already. For if we take the word believe for a
persuasion that our sins are done away, then the Syllogism runs thus; He
that is assured of the pardon of his sins, his sins are pardoned. But I am
assured of the pardon of my sins: therefore my sins are pardoned. Faith
receives the pardon of sin, as it is proffered in the word of grace, and
groundeth it self solely and immediately upon the promise of God in Jesus
Christ: But the ground, whereupon a sinner in himself guilty should build
assurance that his sins are pardoned, without some other act of faith coming
betwixt the promise and that assurance, there is none. The Gospel offers
pardon to the thirsty and burdened, if he will receive it: assures them of
pardon, who have embraced the promise: but where shall we find ground,
whereupon the guilty person who belieueth not to remission of sins may be
assured, that his sins not actually pardoned, are yet pardoned and blotted
out of Gods remembrance? Faith takes the pardon presented to it in the word of
promise, and travailing with it, brings forth actual remission of sin,
which upon our faith we receive. Assurance is not before pardon, nor actual
remission before faith, unless the effect be before the cause, and the same
thing be both cause and effect. To be^ieue in Christ to salvation is to receive
him. John 1.12. Heluet. confess. art. 15.
But to receive Christ as he is offered unto us in the Gospel is not to be
assured that our sins are already pardoned in and through Jesus Christ, but
to rest upon him for pardon. Before the act of justification faith has for
object this proposition concerning the future, To me believing my sins shall
be forgiven: but after the promise is received and pardon obtained, Par: de
Iustific: lib. cap. 10.
it has this proposition concerning the present or time past, To me believing
in Christ my sins are forg^ued. And thus the horned argument of the Jesuit,
Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 1. cap 10. Sect. ratio secunda. Idem de Eccl. lib. 4.
cap. 11.. Sectary nostri.
whereby he would prove, the special mercy of God not to be the object of
faith Justifying, and our doctrine in that point to b e gross and absurd, is
easily untied, For thus he reasons; Justifying faith goes, before
Justification: But faith in the special mercy of God follows Justification.
For he that belieueth the pardon of his sins, is either just before or not
just; if just before, then faith iustifye^h not; if unjust; then believing that
his sins be pardoned, he belieueth a lie. Our answer is, that special
faith has the sundry acts; but to this purpose specially two. The first
heartily to desire, earnestly to thirst after, D. Field of the Ch: lib. 3. cap.
44* Bolton of walking with God page 321. 322. To believe that my sin is now
forgiven in Christ is rather an act of experience in a Belieuer now justified
then that belief which is required to Justification. P. Bayn. Help to true
Happiness. part. 2. qu. 9.
humbly to entreat for acceptance and confidently to rest upon the promise of
free remission: The other comfortably to assure and persuade, that that is
granted, which was desired and received in promise. Faith by her first act
obtains and receives pardon, and does not find us just, when we begin to
believe: by her second act, she does not actually justify but finding the
thing done, certifyeth and assures us of it. So then special faith in her
first act, is before Justification, and procures, obtains and receives
pardon, but then she has not the persuasion of it as already done in her
second act she presupposes the thing done, and already obtained, and so
truly persuades the belieuer of it, but procures not the doing of it. Before
Justification faith seeks and receives the promise of forgiveness: after
Justification, it comfortably assures of the blessing obtained: in both it
has for it object the special mercy of God in Christ. Faith receives Christ
offered in the Gospel and it persuades and assures of pardon in Christ
received: both these be the acts of faith, sometimes expressed Iustifiing
faith has some acts as a cause disposing preparing and fitti^g us to the
receipt of that gracious savor, whereby God does justify us; and other, as a
susceptiue cause, receiving, embracing and enjoying the same. In the former
respect faith consists not in a persuasion that we are the sons of God, but in
the latter Field: appendex to the fifth Book second part.
in the definition of Justifying faith: but if we speak of faith as it
iustifyeth it peculiarly embraces Christ with his benefits as he is proffered
in the word and Sacrament. For faith which is required to Justification is not
a persuasion or knowledge of things already possessed, but a confid^nce of
things promised and upon believing to be obtained, which in the order of
causes, not in time, does go before remission of sins. Who knows not, that
we must believe, that we might be justified? Justified, I say, and not
certified of Justification by the benefit of faith. The Scripture is clear;
Believe, and thou shall be saved, God justifies the circumcision by faith; and
the uncircumcision through faith. Do not these, and many the like passages
show, that Justification and not only the sense and manifestation of
Justification already obtained, does depend on faith.

. 4. It may be said, we are justified before in Gods decree. Indeed whom God
does justify, them he decreed to justify from all eternity, but whereas
election is manifested by faith as by its effect, justification does depend
upon faith, as its cause, and we are justified by faith as the instrument
thereof. For election is an act immanent and eternal,. 3. Act. 16.31. Romans
3.30.
but justification transient and in time, inferring some change in the person
justified, not physiciall, but moral and in respect of state,. 4.
whereby it comes to pass that the person is in another condition and account
then he was before. In brief, the act of faith preswading of the pardon of
sin already obtained by believing, and glorying in the sense of Gods mercy,
must be distinguished from that act of faith which justifies; and is a
leaving or staying upon Christ to obtain remission; the privilege of grace
and comfort which comes to the soul by believing, must be distinguished from
the condition of the covenant, which is required on our parts, before we can
obtain pardon. This is the rather to be noted, Fishers answer to certain
articles.
because the maine cauils of the papists against our doctrine touch^ng
particular confidence in Gods mercy, and certainetie of salvation, are
grounded upon this surmise, that we make that faith, which is an assured and
certain persuasion of our particular election, iustific^tion and salvation, to
be the sole cause, to wit, on Man's part, of Justification: whereas
Justification it self must go before the assurance of it, and such* persons*
only can have true assurance and certainty of their Just fication, election,
and Salvation, who do unfeignedly believe and know assuredly that they believe
as they ought. And it makes much for the comfort of many faithful people, who
commit their souls unto Christ Jesus, and depend upon him and no other for
salvation, who yet are much perplexed, as if they had no faith nor could do
ought pleasing unto God, because they want this certain assurance of the
remission of their sins; whereas if they had learned what it is to believe
unto Justification, and trust unto the promise for pardon, they might for the
present take comfort in this, that notwithstanding their fear, they rely upon
Christ and commit their souls unto God as to their faithful Redeemer, and
might with more ease and speed grow up unto the desired comfort and assurance,
when they should distinctly perceive and discern the ground^ of faith and
assurance, by what steps and degrees they must clime from the one unto the
other.

CHAP. VIII.
By faith a true belieuer may be certain and infallibly assuredly of the
remission of his sins and eternal salvation.

. 1. How Faith assures of salvation.
. 1. IT is a Principle, common amongst our Adversaries, that eue^y conclusion
issu^ng from one proposition revealed expressly in Scripture, and another
clearly and certainly known otherwise, and by evident and good consequent
added unto it, b longs to faith and is believed by no other habit, then of
faith. As for example; All the dead shall rise. Peter is dead: therefore Peter
shall rise. The conclusion is Theological and belongs to faith, though it be
not expressly written, that Peter is dead, or that he shall rise again. So it
is in this present matter; All that believe shall be saved: this proposition
is of faith because it is immediately revealed and expressly written. But I
believe; this is certain by the testimony of the renewed conscience, to him
that has proved himself to be in the faith. The conclusion, therefore I shall
be saved, is certain by faith: because it is inferred of one thing believed,
and another that is evident. And although the holy Ghost, not tying himself to
terms, 1. Ioh. 4.13. and 3.14. and 5.13. Romans 6.8.
do sometime call it knowledge, yet calling it again believing alone, or
believing and knowing, it is manifest such a knowledge is intended, as not only
flows from the principles of faith, but also is reduced to the same habit.
For with what other eyes can the soul behold the heavenly light of the
Gospel. How shall that confidence, ass^rance or certainetie which is created
by the mixture of the light of the Scripture, with the light of a good
conscience renewed by the holy Ghost, belong to any humane knowledge, when the
Scripture says expressly, The promise of the Spirit is received by faith; and
whe^esoeuer in all the Bible, Gal. 3.14.
the Gospel is revealed, men are called upon to believe. And if there be
granted a certainetie of a man's own special standing which certainetie arises
from the Scriptures, one ground thereof being a proposition or sentence
immediately divine, the other inferred and concluded from that which is divine:
it must be granted also, that it is a work or effect of faith. The Scripture
reports how many of the children of God were tried by mocking and scourging,
Heb. 11.36.
by bands and imprisonment, they were stoned, hewn asundder, tempted; they
wandered up and down destitute and afflicted: All which the Apostle says,
They did by faith and confidence of the promises; and yet their assurance was
no other, nor otherwise begotten, then the ordinary assurance of all Gods
children, which is concluded by joining the light of their conscience kindled
by the holy Ghost, and ruled by the Scriptures, to the immediate light of the
conditions revealed in the Scriptures. Faith which is believed or the doctrine
of faith is written in the word of God, the holy Scriptures: but faith whereby
we believe, or of the heart, is written engraven, rooted in the heart out of
the word of God by the holy Ghost, and known, not believed, by the testimony
of the renewed conscience enlighned by the Spirit and directed by the word: for
the rule by which a man discerns himself to believe, is the doctrine of Gods
word, declaring the quality of Faith: And the certainetie or assurance which a
just person has of his particular Justification, depends upon the right
application of two propositions; one immediately divine and ertainely believed,
Whosoever belieueth in Jesus Christ shall be saved: the other inferred and
concluded from hat which is divine, certainly known according to the
direction of the word But I believe.

. 2. This assurance is not such,. 2. What manner of assurance is obtained.
as whereby a man is made absolutely out of all doubt: but such as many times
is assaulted, and shaken with many difficulties, fears and doubts: which
notwithstanding a^ise from the the nature of faith, as if it ought to be: but
from the frailty and corruption of our evil nature, by reason whereof faith
is not such as it ought to be It is not the office of faith to cherish and
maintain such fears and doubts, but to resist them, to fight against them,
and so much as is possible to expel them, and dr^ne them out. But yet by
reason of the strength of our natural corruption, and the weakness of our
faith, we attain not to this; and how much the weaker our faith is so much
are we the further from it. Again the days of faith are as the seasons of
the year, some fair, some foul; one while a Sunshine summer, another while
a long and tedious winter, sometimes no more but a storm and away. Our eyes
are not always alike intent to the word of God; we do not always alike
conceive the promises of God: nay, temptations sometimes hide them out of our
sight. The effects of grace do not always appear the same, yea sometimes
they seem to be quite overwhelmed which contain effects. And in nature it
self there is a voluntary shrinking and relinquishing of the comfort of
faith, through the seeds of unbelief that originally are sown in us.

. 3.
. 3. The particular certainetie of remission of sins and eternal salvation,
which Just persons attain unto upon their Repentance, Faith and Obedience, is
not equal in certainty and firmness of assent, to that assurance which they
have about the common object of faith; to wit, concerning the articles of
Creation, Incarnation, Resurrection, or the like: because these articles are
totally and immediately revealed in holy Scripture; but that his sins in
particular are remitted, depends upon an Argument, whereof only one part is
immediately the word of God, and the other a collection arising upon reflection
and observation of a Man's own qualities and actions and the conclusion is more
or less certain according to the condition of the second proposition. It is a
thing more certain and evident to faith, that God gave Christ to die for
sinners, that whosoever belieueth in him, should not perish, but have life
everlasting; then it is to my conscience, that I believe with well-rooted and
al-seasoning confidence: I have greater assurance, that God is faithful and
true, then that my heart is upright: Therefore I have greater assurance, that
the true belieuer shall be saved, then that I my self am received unto mercy.
Albeit faith do sometimes stagger and wander as touching the very principles
themselves and immediate word of God; yet because the truth and certainetie
thereof is more easily and better conceived, they are for the most part more
familiarly and readily believed. But the conclusions, because of themselves
they are unknown, and have their light only from the principles, are not so
firmly apprehended as the principles themselves, whilst doubts happily may be
cast, least there be any error committed in the application and use thereof.
It is a principle delivered for assurance of salvation, Believe in the Lord
Jesus Christ: and thou shall be saved. Hereupon the faithful man infers to
himself, I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ: therefore I shall be saved. In
this either confusedly or expressly inferred, he comforteh himself, and
rejoices in God, and in hope thereof chearefully serves God, calls upon his
name, in patience expects the revealing of his salvation. And yet oftentimes
it falls out, that he questioneth his faith, and not seeing such effects
thereof as he supposes there ought to be, makes doubt lest happily he be
deceived, and though the principle be true by which he first believed, yet he
is jealous lest he have misapplied it to himself.

. 4. This will appear in the several states or sorts of true Belieuers.. 4.
The several states of Belieuers. Esaias 42.3. Math. 12 2^.
There is a state wherein faith is a smoking week, desiring that it could
believe, rather then getting up to feel it self believe, discovering it self
by earnest sighs and groans for mercy, and hanging upon Christ, though the
Belieuer can scarce tell whether he rest upon him or no: This faith is
certain in event, but the Belieuer in this state is far from particular
assurance of his salvation. Again, though faith be not troubled, but do
quietly stay on Christ, and taste God good in letting them find peace with him;
yet such is the infancy of spiritual understanding in Christians, specially
now first converted, that they do not return into themselves, and judge of
that they do, and of the great consequence of that they do. Hence it is that
they will tell you, they find God good to them, and go on chearefully in
duties for the present: but they come not to behold the stabilitie of their
salvation. The child lives before he knows that he does live; and knows he
does live, before he knows the cause of life, or the inheritance whereunto he
is borne: and so it may be and is with a Belieuer. Psalm. 31.22. and 77.3, 8, 9,
10.
There is a state in which faith is exercised with temptations from unbelief
or otherwise, by which opposition the soul is kept from obtaining this
certainty, being encountered with doubtful appearances, which it cannot well
answer and clear for the present. There is a state wherein faith is now
grown up, and has either out-wrestled, or otherwise is exempted from knowing
such temptations: in which condition the faithful do persuade themselves,
Phil. 1.19, 20. 2 Timothy 4.18.
that Gods mercy, and truth and power shall carry them through unto
salvation: But when now our consciences shall come to testify through faith
and experience this happy estate, we are subject by neglecting means, laying
down our watch, giving the reins to our lusts, or by secret desertions
ere-while to loose for a time this comfortable persuasion, the Spirit not
speaking in us by his light as heretofore, and our consciences and faith so
hurt and wounded, that the actions of them are troubled, depraved as we see the
like befalls the natural senses and reason. We see through Melancholy what
reason comes to imagine, how that some should seek to kill us, who never
thought us hurt; How the eye thinks it sees things yellow and red, when they
are nothing so; the taste things bitter, when they are sweet: So the sight of
faith and conscience, when nothing but sin, guilt, wrath, angry desertion
ouer-lay it, it seems to see every thing for the time, of like color to
those things wherewith it is possessed. Thus sometimes the strong faith is
shaken greatly and strongly assaulted, so that he that unspeakably rejoiced in
the salvation of the Lord, by hasty cogitations is brought to say, I am cast
out of the sight of thine eyes. Psalm. 31.22.
And if faith escape these rocks, may not yet a more serious examination of
our ways, and through fight of our nakedness, imperfections, and manifold
transgressions; the strength of our lusts, the disorder of our passions, our
daily failings, and that great weakness which in trials we shall find in our
selves: may not those things, I say, raise fear in the heart of a sound
Belieuer, as not altogether without the reach of possible danger, without
repentance and greater constancy in performing all Christian duties then
hitherto he has made proof of, specially if the apprehension of the multitude
and heinousness of sins be quickened by afflictions, or the lively
cogitations of the terrors of the day of Judgment? Nevertheless, as a child
affrighted runs to the Father, looking for defense and help of him, even so
in the midst of all fears, temptations, difficulties, and distresses, faith
is still running unto God, still importuning him, calling upon him,
expostulating with him, casting it self still upon him, depending upon his
aid, and expecting of him that things become otherwise then presently they are.

. 5. Thus faith of adherencie is stronger then faith of. 5.
evidence, Faith of adherence stronger and more necessary then faith of
evidence.
and belief in Christ for remission, then assurance of pardon and
forgiveness: And as faith in Christ is stronger then particular certainty of
our salvation; so it is it more necessary. For belief in Christ is absolutely
necessary to remission of sins, in all them that be of age and discretion:
but assurance comes not at first when we believe, but by little and little as
God sees it requisite, according to the trial he has appointed to make of
us. Without faith in Christ as the only author of salvation and sole end of
faith, with whom our souls seek perfect union, it is impossible to please
God: no action, though in it self never so good or holy, is truly acceptable,
unless it be quickened and enliued by this faith: But many poor souls that
want assurance of Gods special favor, are tenderly beloved of him as heirs
of salvation, and their good works accepted in Jesus Christ. A Christian of an
humble and broken spirit, denying himself and renouncing the World, believing
that his sins are pardonable and earnestly desiring remission of sins by
the merits of Christ; resting upon Christ alone for salvation, and joining with
this desire and affiance the sincere, impartial practice of obedience to all
Gods Commandments, according to that measure of grace which he has received,
without question he shall receive the inheritance of eternal glory, although
he may be scrupulous in himself, wanting this persuasion and assurance that
his sins are pardoned. And yet because God has commanded us to labor for
the perfection of all graces, we are sure this must be entreated for, and have
a promise that it shall be granted, as God sees meet, both for the time and
measure of it.

. 6. Infallible assurance of salvation may be obtained.
. 6. That not only some uncertain hope and dim sight of Gods favor, but
even assurance is to be sought, and may be obtained, is thus manifest. Faith
may receive what the Word does testify: for the Word of God is the object of
faith. But there is a word testifying thus much, that my particular person
beholding the Son, and believing on him, shall have eternal life, and be
raised up at the last day; that there is no condemnation to me being in Christ.
Acts 10.43. 1 These. 5.10. Luke 2 10, 11. Esaias 9.6. 1. John 3.15. John 6.35. 1.
John 5.10, 13
Neither could John with the faithful believe Gods love toward them in
particular, if some word did not show it. For the Papists themselves will not
say, that all o^ them were privileged with singular revelation Our Aduersa^ies
reply, that there is no Word of God, saying, Cornelius believe thou that thou
shall be saved: and where there is no word, there is no faith: for these two
are relatiues. This cavil is easily removed: for that cannot be believed as
out of the Word of God, which is not found in the Word of God expressly,
Bellar. de Iustif. l. 3. cap. 8.. 1.
or by consequence but whatsoever is found there expressly, or may evidently by
direct consequence be deduced thence, that may be believed as out of the Word
of God. Now howsoever it be not said in so many syllables, Peter, Thomas,
Cornelius thy sins are remitted to thee believing, yet evidently so much may
be concluded out of those general promises, Every man that belieueth shall
have eternal life: for the universal does include it particular. Therefore
the messengers of the Lord of Host, do give notice to their Congregations,
that the matter which they proclaim in the Name of the Lord does concern
them, and every of them, saying in effect, Acts 13.26. and 3.26. and 2.38. 2.
Cor. 5.20.
To you is the word of this salvation sent. What they say to all men, they say
to every man: what to penitents, to every penitent; what to Belieuers, to every
Belieuer; what to sinners and ungodly, to every sinner. God gave his Law to all
Israel, speaking to all, as if he had spoken namely and particularly to every
one, Thou shall have no other Gods, etc. Exodus 20.1, 2.
May not, ought not a man to infer thence, I must have none other Gods, etc.
The promise of the Gospel runs thus, If thou shall confess with thy mouth
the Lord Jesus, Romans 10.9.
and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shall be
saved. Is not this spoken to every man particularly? May not he as out of the
Word infer, If I believe I shall be saved? Our Savior Christ had said
nothing namely to Paul and Silas as touching the Iailer, that if he did
believe he should be saved: But out of that universal, John 3.16. Act. 16.31.
Whosoever belieueth shall be saved, they proclaim comfort to him in
special, Believe thou, and thou shall be saved. There is nothing found in
Scripture expressly touching this or that man's resurrection in particular: is
it not then to be believed out of the Word? The Scripture says to him that
belieueth, Thou shall inherit eternal life, as much as it does to any
particular man now living, Thou shall rise again. Because our Savior said to
the Apostles, John 20.23.
Whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted, our Adversaries (though falsely)
would collect; that their Priests have power to absolve a man from all his
sins. Do they know assuredly, that what was spoken to the Apostles, was
spoken also to their Priests, though there be no particular mention of them in
the Gospel; and will they not allow us to infer a particular from a
general? Psalm. 23.1. Job. 19.25.
David could say, The Lord is my shepherd; Job I know that my Redeemer lives:
which they believed out of the Word, grounding themselves upon the promises of
mercy. And we now living by the same faith, having the same precious
promises, being led by the same Spirit, may out of the word of life be assured
that our sins are forgiven and covered. Moreover every faithful soul in
particular does find, Psalm. 103.3.4.
hear and read in the word, Who forgiueth all thine iniquities, and heals
all thine infirmities. To every faithful soul in special the Lord says,
Isay 43.25. Psalm. 103.17. Mica. 7.19. Ier. 31.34. Romans 11.22. Ephesians. 5.10. Math.
19.17.
I even I am he that blotteth out thine iniquities for mine own sake, and
remember thy sins no more. This he speaks to singular belieuers, not to
some persons only as it is evident in that the Scripture does in universal
repeat the same thing. What our Savior said to the young man, If thou
would enter into life, keep the Commandments, the papists teach that is
spoken to all men, and if a man fulfill that condition he may believe to be
saved. Look how they know the words spoken to the young man so many hundred
years past to be directed unto them: by the same rule may every faithful
soul interest himself in all the gracious and lovely speeches, wherewith God
from time to time has comforted his people, and take unto himself those
promises, answers and assurances that God has at any time made and given unto
them, resolving of all the rest that which in one case the Apostles
exemplifyeth of that that was written of the Justification of Abraham, that
those things were not written for them only, but for the^ also who believe as
they had done. Romans 4.23.
The word then speaks in particular to them that believe; but can a
Christian, know and be assured that he does truly believe? Such as truly
believe, may know they believe, as he that has a jewel in his hand, may know
that he has it. Paul did know on whom he had believed: 2. Tim. 1.12.
the poor man in the Gospel cries, Lord I believe: David says, I believed,
Mark 9.24. Psalm. 116.10. 2. Cor. 4.13.
and therefore I spoke; Hezekiah prays, Lord remember me how I have walked
before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart: John concludes thus, Esaias
38.3, 4. 1. John 3-24.
Hereby we know that he abides in us, even by the Spirit, which he has given
us. How could we say every one we believe, if we might not know it? Can we
speak that truly, whereof we can have no certainty? When I see one, or trust
to a man's word promising me this or that, I know I see him, trust to him and
rest on him for that he has promised: Shall I by faith, see Christ the Son,
and rest on him, and yet know no such thing? 1. John 3.19. 1. Cor. 2.11.
Carnal confidence may be discerned, why then should it be impossible for a
true Belieuer to know that he does believe? The Spirit of man discerns what
is in man: he knows what is in himself, though not ever the measure or
quantity thereof. He that loves his Brother, knows the love, wherewith he
loves him: and he that belieueth in God, may know the faith, wherewith he
belieueth. Many beguile themselves, while they stand in opinion they do
believe, and believe not at all. What then? Shall he that belieueth unfeignedly
be altogether uncertain, whether he believe, or no? There is that boasts
when his soul has naught: yet men whom God has blessed with abundance, may
know that they be rich. Many are deceived in matters of faith and true worship
of God; shall not a Christian then be certain of his Religion? A man that
dreameth of hono^r and promotion, plenty and abundance, may live in infamy
and disgrace, penury and hunger: and yet they that be promoted to honor and
live in plenty, may assuredly be persuaded of what God has given them. Some
men's senses are deluded, shall every man therefore be in suspense of
whatsoever he sees or hears? He that is falsely persuaded of his good estate
and strong faith, deceives his own soul: shall he therefore that unfeignedly
embraces Christ, and rests upon him, be ever at uncertainties, whether he
does believe or no? The heart unregenerate is deceitful and wicked above all
things: Ier. 17.9. Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 3. cap. 8. sect. Huius argumenti. To
be in the faith, is to have faith in them. Romans 8.1. and 5.9. Ephesians. 3.17. 1.
John 4 16. Romans 8.8. 2. Cor. 13.5.6. Ephesians. 3.17.
the heart regenerate is true and faithful: In respect of the exact measure of
grace and strength the regenerate are often deceived: but of the truth of grace
they may be assured: in some particular resolutions they be ignorant of their
own hearts: but of their general purpose they may firmly and truly be
pe^swaded. Paul bids us to prove and try our selves, whether we have not that
faith, by which Christ dwells in our hearts, which works by love, which is
the faith of such as are accepted with God, are purged from their sin, and
are become Temples of the Holy Ghost: intimating that by examination it is to
be discerned and known whether we believe. And if we may know that we have
faith, whereby Christ dwells in us by his Spirit, R^em. annot. in 2. Co.
13.5. sect. 1
and we in him, then may we know also that we have repented truly of our
sins: for faith and repentance be inseparable companions, and who so has the
one, he cannot be destitute of the other. It is one thing to repent, another
to believe: but these two live and dwell together, that if one be wanting there
is neither in truth.

. 7. They object further, It suffices not to believe unto salvation,. 7.
Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 3. cap. 6. Acts 8.37.
but a man must believe with his whole heart: which no man, say they, can
certainly affirm. Indeed faith sincere, upright, and wel-rooted is required on
our parts to Justification, 1. Tim. 1.5.
but not absolutely perfect in degree, without weakness or defect: And this
may be known by him that has it, else could not the Eunuch have answered, I
believe; nor David have promised, Acts 8.37, 38. Psalm. 86.12. and 138.1. Psalm.
119.10.69
I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart, with my whole heart have I
sought thee. But in these and such like passages, the Psalm. 119.2. Deuteronomy. 4.29.
Ier. 29.13. 2. Chron. 15.15. Prou. 3.5.
whole heart notes the integrity Psalm. 73.1. and 57.11. and 28.6, 7
and uprightness of the soul, not the perfection of grace without any
infirmity or defect; as on the contrary, a fraudulent or hypocritical heart
is called Psalm. 12.2.
an heart divided, and the whole heart is opposed to a fained and hypocritical
heart; as the Lord complains by his Prophet, Ier. 3.10.
Judah has not returned unto me, with her whole heart, but fainedly. And thus
we shut up this first reason, That which the Scripture says to pertain to
all and singular Belieuers, Luke 7.50. Mark 16.16.
that every Belieuer may certainly assure himself of by faith: But the
Scripture shows remission of sins to pertain to all and every Belieuer.

Again, What we are taught to ask of God in Prayer, and have a promise to
obtain, that by faith we may be assured to obtain. Mark 11.24. 1. John
5.14.15. Psalm. 145.18.
For God that has commanded us to pray, and directed what to ask according to
his will, and promised to grant the desires of them that call upon him in truth
according to his Commandment, he will not deny his promise, nor go back
from the thing that he has spoken. But we are commanded to ask the pardon and
forgiveness of our sins, and have a promise to be heard in that which we
desire. Therefore by faith we may be assured of the particular remission of
our offenses. Our Adversaries except, that what we are assured of already,
Bellar. de Eccl. l. 4. cap. 11. praeterea. In what sense forgiveness of sins
is to be prayed for.
that we cannot ask of God in prayer: and therefore if we be assured of
pardon, we must not pray for pardon. What, is it lawful in no sense to pray
for that whereof we are assured? David prayed to God for the pardon of those
sins, which he believed by faith were forgiven (for so was he assured from
the Lord by the Prophet Nathan) unless we shall charge him with infidelity
for not believing the Prophet: since the speech was so plain, that he could
not but understand it. I have sinned against the Lord: 2. Sam. 12.12, 13.
A plain and true confession. The Lord also has put away thy sin, thou
shall not die. As plain and certain an absolution. Will our Adversaries come
in here with their vain distinction of guilt and punishment, of temporal and
eternal? If they do, it is to no purpose. For whatsoever the respects were in
which David prayed for the forgiveness of his sins, once this is clear,
that he prayed for it: and then what remains, but that our adversaries must
condemn him of sinning grievously in asking God pardon for those sins, which
he believed by faith were forgiven him; or of infidelity for not believing; or
else grant it lawful in some regard to crave pardon, when it is already
granted, and believed to be so. But further it is manifest, that both guilt
and punishment were remitted: because the Prophet precisely mentions both
parts. The Lord has taken away thy sin: There is the guilt wipt away. Thou
shall not die: There is the punishment forgiven, the whole punishment, the
whole penalty of the statute concerning sin. And yet nothing is more clear,
Psalm. 32.1, 2. Psalm. 51.1, 2.
then that David begs pardon both of the guilt and punishment of his offenses,
and that God would make him see and feel this forgiveness of his every day
more and more. Neither yet does it follow, that then prayer for forgiveness is
an effect of a weak faith; because though our faith were strong, yet the
feeling of our own wretchedness, the just desert of sin, and the wrath of
God due unto us, would wring out such entreatie from us: as we see the
extremity which our Savior Christ was in upon the Cross made him cry out so
mainly, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Math. 27.46.
albeit he was fully assured that God neither had, nor would utterly forsake
him. Again, one chief reason and end of our praying to God for pardon is,
that we may always acknowledge, that every sin committed by us deserves
everlasting damnation of it self, and should everlastingly be punished, if
that God had not accepted our Savior Christ's satisfaction for us: By which
though we are freed if we rest on him by faith, yet both it is our duty
according to Gods Commandment to sue for pardon for his sake; and in truth if
we do it not, we have no reason to persuade our selves that our sins are
pardoned. For howsoever it is true, that Christ our Head has paid the price of
our ransom, yet it is also true, that we every day deserve damnation, and
must entreat God for pardon, that so we may come to that assurance, which the
Lord has enjoined us to labor and seek for. Zech. 12.10.
The Spirit that leads us to Christ, does stir us up with all earnestness
and confidence to crave pardon and forgiveness of our sins. These two
confidence and prayer God has joined together, and no man can or may put them
asunder. Our faith assures us not of forgiveness of sins without prayer,
but that God forgiueth us when we pray: Nor is this heavenly pledge, while
dormant, though truly dwelling in our souls, immediately apt to justify.
Matters of faith be of diverse sorts: Some fully acted and done already, and
those we only believe, we do not pray for them; as the Creation of the World,
the Birth, and Death and Resurrection of Christ, and other such like:
Other-some are believed, as designed, promised, and in a sort conferred, but
not yet fully acted and effected to us: which we so believe by faith, as that
still we pray for them, till they be fully accomplished and effected. Bellar.
de Iustif. lib. 3. cap. 11. Rhem. annot. in Romans 8.38.. 8. Math. 9.2.
The Papists confess, that Peter, Paul, and some other particular persons to
whom our Savior, said, Thy sins are forgiven thee, were assured of the
remission of their iniquities: and yet they ceased not to pray, Forgive us our
trespasses. Do they not see then, that prayer for pardon will stand well with
assurance of remission? And why do they condemn that in us, which was well
done by others.

. 8.
. 8. More distinctly, we continue daily to ask of God forgiveness of sins,
according to the direction and commandment of our Savior Christ, in sundry
respects.





the infusion of faith most perfect, 1. Ioh. 1.8.9. Psalm. 32.3.4. 2. Sam.
12.12.13. with Psalm. 51.1.2. etc.
faithful repentance for sins committed, is as absolutely necessary to
salvation, as the first infusion was.

2. Sam. 7.15.27. 1. Chron. 17.25
David being certified that God would for ever stablish the kingdom in his
house and posterity, forbeareth not to pray that it might be so. Our Savior
Christ knew that his sheep should never perish; yet he prays, Holy Father,
keep them in thy name. John 10.28. John 17.11. Psalm. 16.10. Heb 5.7. John
1^.5. 2. Tim 4.18.
He prays also for deliverance from death and glorification, of both which
he was fully assured. Paul knew assuredly the Lord would deliver him from every
evil work, yet without ceasing he prays to be delivered from evil.
Assurance to speed is that which adds great feruencie to prayer.

forgive us our treaspasses, that we may more fully and really possess and
enjoy, what we believe we already have in Gods affection, and do in part
enjoy. The remission of sins is by faith manifested to our conscience, and in
part we reap the comfort, fruit and effect of it in this life: but still we
are clogged with sin, we live in misery and sorrow; in our selves we are
condemned wretches; still we are liable to many temporal and spiritual
chastisements and desertions for sin, and live in a sort as exiles and
banished men from the immediate and clear vision of God. Therefore being still
in case, as if our sins were not completely pardoned, sin as yet abiding in
us, and subiecting us to the displeasure of God disliking it, and to his
Fatherly chastisement accompanying the same, we pray for forgiveness more
absolute and entire every day in the fruit, effect and comfort of it. True it
is, How justification is full and entire.
that persons justified have full title unto, and right in that mercy of God,
which as it has already delivered them from the dominion and condemnation of
sin, so it will in the end wholly free them from all remainders of sin, and
those chastisements, afflictions and miseries wherewith they a^e exercised in
this life, and in this respect the remission of their sins is full and
perfect: but so long as they live in this vale of tears, sin has it abiding
in them, and they are subject to many calamities by reason of sin, from which
they heartily desire and pray to be delivered.

Acts 3.19.
So long as we walk by faith, and not by sight, we still pray for the sight of
that, as touching which we have now but the comfort of faith and hope, which is
in part and imperfect. By faith we know that we are redeemed both in soul and
body, Romans 8.23.
yet still we sigh in our selves, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption
of our bodies. Our adversaries object again, that by praying that Christ's
merits may be made ours in particular, we greatly abase them As though the
prophet David did abase God in making him his in particular, saying, Psalm.
18.1.2.
The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, my God and my strength, my shield, the
horn of my salvation, and my refuge: The Lord is my sheepeheard, Psalm. 23.1.
I shall not want which agrees sweetly with the voice of the faithful, He is
our God, and he will save us; Isay 25.9. Isay 33.22. Job 34.36.
He is our Lord (not only by right of soueraignetie, but of love and
affection) and he will save us. As though Elihu did abase God in calling him,
My Father; or Thomas did did abase our Savior Christ in calling him, John
20.28.
My Lord and my God; or Paul, when he glories and triumphs in Christ after
this manner, Gal. 2.20. Phil. 1.3.
who loved me and gave himself for me; viz, in a special and peculiar
manner, and not only as he loved Esau, Judas, and other reprobates. We do
no injury to God to make him ours in particular, because he has said, Ier.
31.32.33. and 32.38. and 30.22.
as to Abraham, so to every one of the seed of Abraham, I will be thy God. We
do no injury, because we do not thereby make him our peculiar, but leave him
the same to others, that he is to us, as every man enjoys the light of the
Sun to his own use, without the impeachment thereof to the use of any other
man. A third reason to confirm, that a Christian belieuer may be assured of
the pardon of his sins, is this: What the Apostles and other faithful men
were assured of by ordinary faith, that may all the faithful be assured of
in like manner. Heb. 2.11. 2. Pet. 1.1. Romans 8.38. 1 Cor. 7.40. 2. Tim. 4.8. 1.
John. 3.14. and 5.13. 1. Cor. 4.4. Rhem. annot. in Loc. Rom 8.35. Gal. ^.20.
Phil. 1.19.20. 2. Tim. 4.8. Rhem. annot. in Romans 8 31.
For all the faithful are Brethren and have the like precious faith and
promises. But the Apostles and other faithful have been assured of there
salvation by ordinary faith. Paul pronounces the same certainty of other
men's salvation that he does of his own, and upon grounds which are common to
all the faithful and Saints of God. The Rhemists object that Paul durst not
assure himself that he was justified, saying, I know nothing by my self, yet
am I not thereby justified. Did Paul speak this as doubting of his
justification by faith in Christ? Of his particular assurance he gives
plentiful testimony other where: and our Adversaries teach, that he was
assured by revelation. The place makes strongly against Justification by
works: but against certainty of salvation it makes nothing, unless we shall
make the Apostle contrary to himself, and our Adversaries will say that a man
may be certain by revelation, and yet altogether uncertain. The drift of the
place is to show, that we should not vainly be lifted up with the applause
of men because they know us not, yea we know not our selves thoroughly: for God
is greater then our consciences, and does epsy many secret defaults in us,
which we upon diligent search cannot find out in our own hearts. But did the
Apostle protesting the innocence of his conscience, intend to intimate his
doubtfulnesse of Mind touching his own salvation? In no sort: 1. Ioh.
3.19.21. 2. Cor. 1.12.
for if our conscience accuse us not, then have we boldness: This is our
rejoicing before God, even the testimony of our conscience. Nay this text of
Scripture well weighed, is sufficient to dash the vain cauils of the papists:
For Paul was assured of his salvation, and of the vprightnes of his heart and
conscience, though he was ignorant of many secret infirmities which the most
High did epsy in him, and of that measure of grace which he had received.
What follows hereupon? Even these two things, which directly overthrow the
doctrine of our Adversaries: viz, That he who has received grace from God,
may know the truth, though not the measure of his faith and repentance: And
Ignorance of the exact multitude and greatness of our offenses is no bar or
hinderance to the certainty of salvation. Who knows the multitude of his
sins? Psalm. 1.19.12. Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 3. cap. 5.
Not one. In this life a man can never sufficiently understand the greatness and
multitude of his offenses: yet may he be assured of the remission of sins
known and secret. Because not the perfect knowledge of sin is the cause of
certainty, but the perfect mercy of God, and the perfect merit of Christ; to
which we must look by faith.

. 9. If the end of the Scripture be that we should believe, 1. John 5.10, 11,
12, 13. John 20.31. and 3.16.
and believing should know that we have eternal life, then every Belieuer
that knows himself to be a Belieuer may be certain of his salvation. But
the former is an undoubted truth. It is here objected, Whatsoever we believe by
faith, is as infallible as the Word of God, which assures us of it: If then
the common sort of the faithful, do not believe their salvation to be as
infallible as Gods own Word, they are not by faith assured of it. The answer
is, that the salvation of a Belieuer is as infallible in it self, and in
event, as is the Word of God, which assures him of it: but always it is not
so in his apprehension and feeling. The principles of faith are ever alike
certain, but not apprehended of all with the same degree of certainty. For
there are diverse degrees of faith, little faith, great faith, full assurance of
faith; Math. 8.26. Math. 15.28. Romans 4.21.
even as a weak eye and a strong eye. And as a weak eye sees but weakly and
imperfectly, and a strong eye sees strongly, and more fully discerns the
thing seen: so a little faith belieueth faintly, though truly; greater faith
belieueth more steadfastly; full assurance of faith belieueth under hope, even
against hope. Romans 4 18.
The Disciples of Christ said unto him, We believe and know that thou art
Christ the Son of the living God: John 6.69.
which in it self was infallibly true, and yet they did not so infallibly
apprehend it, but that this faith was soon shaken; and because they did not
infallibly believe it, our Savior tells them, that therefore he forewarned
them of his Death and Resurrection, that when it was come to pass they might
believe. John 14.29.
It was faith that made Peter upon Christ's words to step into the Sea to go
unto him upon the waters, Math. 14.28.
believing that he should be safe; but yet he believed it not infallibly: for
when he began to sink, he cried out for fear, Master, save me. Verse 30, 31.
Luke 24.21.
The Disciples believed in our Savior as the only promised Messiah and
Redeemer of Israel: but when they saw he was put to death, they began to
stagger at it. The like may be noted of their fear and doubting at other
times. Yea, that assurance that is had by extraordinary revelation is not
altogeth^r free from fears and doub^s, shaking sometimes the confidence of
that which a man has received immediately from the oracle of Gods own mouth,
or by special messengers directed from God for certificate in that behalf.
Which is to be seen in the examples of Abraham, Isaac, David, Genesis 12.12, 13.
Psalm. 31.22. 1. Sam. 27.1.
and others, to whom God had given special promise of his protection and
favor; and yet upon occasions they have bewrayed great infirmity in the
apprehension thereof. And if this befall to faith in those things which are
extraordinarily revealed (for it is faith ordinary by which a man belieueth
such extraordinary revelations) much more we may assure our selves, it
befalls there, where we have no other but ordinary revelation by the
written Word of God. Also the Word of God once spoken and often reiterated is
of equal certainty in it self: but to help our weakness, the Lord goes
over one and the same thing again and again. Things believed are in
themselves more certain then things seen, but not apprehended by us with such
assurance. Of these who doubts? of the other who doubts not at some times?
The Prophets, our Savior Christ and his Apostles, do labor often to confirm
unto us matters of faith by reasons, similitudes, signs examples, incurring
into the senses, not only to better our understanding, but to confirm our
faith: which is an argument, that to us things sensible are often more certain
then things believed, though in themselves more uncertain. Moreover,
conclusions theological are in themselves as certain, as are the principles
upon which they are grounded, but always they are not so infallible to our
understanding and conscience: because the inference is not so well, readily and
plainly perceived, as has been showed before. And so though the salvation of
the Belieuer be as certain as the word of promise, upon which his faith is
surely builded, yet it is not so infallibly known to the Belieuer himself, it
being far more easy to conceive, that a belieuer shall be saved, then to
assure the conscience, that he is a true Belieuer. What the Lord has
immediately revealed, that faith receives with the greatest certainty: but
what is concluded out of the Word from one proposition immediately divine, and
another certainly known by some other light, that may be believed with
infallible assurance. And so he that is justified and has obtained remission
of sins, may assuredly know or believe that he has received mercy of the
Lord: otherwise he can never truly be thankful to God for that inestimable
benefit. For he that knows not whether he has received it or not, nor can
assure himself of it without intolerable and inexcusable presumption, how
should he from the heart give God thanks for this unspeakable favor? But to
think, that mortal men are never bound to give God thanks, for the greatest
benefit that is bestowed upon them in this world, is most absurd. It is
objected, That in this state of temptation, Bellar. de Iustif. lib. 3. cap. 8..
Tertia ratio.
(such is our infirmity) assurance would engender pride. And immediate and
perfect assurance, such as is free from all assault, and impeachment of fear
and doubt, might peradventure by the corruption of our nature, be abused to
security and pride: But such perfection in this life we attain not unto;
because the Lord knows it not expedient. As we have a measure of true
righteousness, though weak and imperfect: so have we a meas^re of true and
comfortable assurance against fear and doubt, though by reason of our
weakness, mixed with many fears and doubts. Thus the Lord deals with us in
great wisdom, (knowing our inabilitie to weild any better condition) that by
the sweetness of grace we might be allured to yield cheerful obedience,
The benefits that come unto us by temptations.
and be sustained in temptations, and by the sense of our weakness together
with the sharpness of temptation, fear and perplexity, might be kept from
swelling in pride, security, love of carnal liberty, negligence to preserve
our faith, and such like. And as sometimes by his admirable wisdom he makes
sin the whetstone of righteousness: so by affliction and trouble, by d^strusts
and fearful doubts, he whetteth and sharpeneth our faith and assurance;
which by fighting increases, and the longer it wrastleth the stronger it
waxes, whilst faith powers forth Prayer, and pouring forth of Prayer
obtains further strength of faith. Knocking makes the link to burn more
clearly, and the shaking of a tree by stormy blasts settles the root and the
tree more firmly: so temptations, troubles, and fears by the wise providence
of God, make for the increase and confirmation of faith. As a man in danger of
drowning catches for hold to save himself: so whilst the comfort of life
makes offer to go from us, we take the better hold thereof, and it becomes so
much the more precious and dear unto us. By our corruption virtues become
poisons, and by the wisdom of God sins are made medicines: But as we do
not condemn virtue, though our corrupt hearts do sometimes abuse it; nor
commend sin, for that it is used as a spur to righteousness: no more do
we approve doubting, for the good that God works by it, nor disallow full
assurance because of the evil that might ensue to us thereby abusing the same.
In brief, pride is the daughter of corruption, not of filial confidence, nor
may it be condemned for it, because that verde springs from another root.

. 10.
. 10. A man may believe, say the Romanists, that he shall have eternal life,
if he keep the Commandments: but because he is not assured that he shall so
do, he remains in fear. And very justly may he be in fear, or rather in
despair, that looks for eternal life upon no other condition. The Apostle
indeed does plainly debar him from all hope and expectation thereof, when he
says, So many as are of the works of the Law, Gal. 3.10.
are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one, etc, It is not
for them that profess the faith of Christ, by their keeping of the
Commandments to expect the obtaining of eternal life: Gal. 5.4. Romans 4.14.
Gal. 3.18. 1. John 5.10, 11 Romans 6.23.
Ye are fallen from grace (says the Apostle) that will be justified by the
Law: If they which be of the Law be heirs, then is faith made void. The
Commandments of God are laid before Belieuers, not as the cause for obtaining
of eternal life, but as the way to walk in unto eternal life, assured unto
us by the free promise, and gift of God. And of this promise and gift of God
the keeping of Gods Commandments is a part, who has said, I will put my Law
into their hearts, Ier. 31.33. Ezekiel. 36.27. Ephesians. 2.10.
and cause them to walk in my Statutes. And though a man be weak, fe^ble and
imperfect, yet finding and feeling the work of sanctification begun in him,
he may be assured that he who has wrought this beginning of life, will go
forward therewith unto the end. Our Savior Christ said to the young man in the
Gospel, Phil. 1.6. Math. 19.17.
If thou will enter into life, keep the Commandments: But that young
Pharisee, was ignorant of the Law and his own estate, rested in external
works of righteousness, and when he came to Christ, was destitute of the true
knowledge of the Messiah, John 17.3.
without which our Adversaries will confess) there is no eternal life: and so
from their own grounds, it is absurd to imagine, that Christ by these words
did simply intend to direct him a way for the obtaining of eternal life by his
own works or merits. We grant, the Law to which our Savior referred that
young man, to be the rule of obedience according to which people in covenant
ought to walk, building their works of righteousness upon faith as the
foundation: and obedience issuing from faith unfeigned to be the way to
eternal bliss: We acknowledge also, that no man can be assured of remission
of his sins, who does not walk before God in uprightness and integrity:
but this upright, unfeigned obedience is imperfect, the effect of that faith
which justifies, Upright walking is necesrie, but not the cause of
Justification. Psalm. 119.1, 2. and 1.1, 2. Psalm. 32.1, 2.
not the cause of Justification. When the Scripture pronounces them blessed
that fear God, keep his Commandments, and walk in the undefiled way, does
it not describe the person whose sins are covered, in which stands his
happiness? Our Savior has taught us plainly, That except our righteousness
exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall in no wise
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Math. 5 20.
What righteousness does he here mean? In^erent, or the righteousness of
works: for he presses an uniform observation of all Gods Commandments. The
Scribes and Pharisees did (as it seem) even then calumniate him, ^s they did
afterward Paul (and the Papists do us still) as a dest^oye^ of the Law,
because he reproved their confidence in works, and sought to establish the
doctrine of faith, which now we teach. Needful in this respect was that
caue^t; I think not that I am come to destroy the Law and the Prophets: Verse
17. Math. 5.17.
I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill them. And in these words, as our
Savior renders a reason, why he that breaks any of those Commandments,
which the Scribes and Pharisees counted the least, shall be counted least in
the kingdom of Heaven: Verse 19.
so he makes passage to the exposition of the law in the verses following,
where he cleares it from the corrupt glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees. And
it is to be noted, that he says, Verse 20.
not, Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Law and
Prophets: but except it exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,
to wit, that righteousness which they taught and practiced, who made none
account of some commandments which they called the least, urged only an
external observation of the Law according to the letter without any respect of
inward piety, and maimed and m^ngled the word as pleased themselves. The
sentence therefore must be understood of inherent righteousness, whence the
necessity of good works is strongly concluded. The faith that justifies is
lively and operative, ever conjoined with an affection of piety and obsequious
disposition, as powerful to bring forth deeds of mercy, as to make firm and
faithful application of Christ's righteousness, or conceive sure trust of Gods
mercy offered in him. Now what is required in faith that it may justify, of
necessity it must go before assurance of pardon and forgiveness. True it is
then, that without inherent holiness no man can be assured of his acquittance
from sin: but if we enquire into the true cause of absolution, it is the sole
grace and mercy of God in Jesus Christ, embraced by a true and lively faith.
Does this any thing prejudice Christian assurance, that without true and
sincere obedience, at least without a promptitude, ap^nesse, inclination and
resolution to do good works, and walk in obedience, there can be no
^ssurance? No: For the belieuer relieth not upon his works, though he
exercise himself therein with all diligence: and though he know well that he
comes infinitely short of what God commands and bewail his daily failings,
and sees he has need to renew his purpose and resolution to better his
obedience; and condemns the imperfections that he espieth more and more in
himself: yet it is not impossible to be assured of the truth and uprightness
of his heart and sincere, though imperfect, desire and endeavor to walk with
God: which as the fruit of the Spirit and effect of faith does evidence his
reconciliation with God. For he that fears God and walks in his ways, in
the perfect and undefiled way, is justified from sin. And he that knows, 1.
John. 1.3, 4.
that he walks before God in truth and with a perfect ^^a t, may certainly
conclude from this fruit of the Spirit, that his sins are pardoned.

. 11. I might add,. 11.
that the faithful are sealed by the Spirit, and by the same Spirit are
enabled to cry Abba Father, What infirmities may stand with assurance.
whereby they are assured of the pardon of their s^nnes: but I will shut up
this matter, briefly showing what infirmities may stand with assurance of
faith, and what sins cannot, that Christians may be directed the better to
make trial of their estate. 1. John 1.7.
If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we live and do
n t the truth: and if we say that we (such as John then was regenerate and in
the state of grace) have no sin, Verse 8.
we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. Even such then as walk in
the light, and have fellowship with God, are sinners, Prou. 20.9. Ecles. 7.2.
1. John 3.9.
and not just or perfect in themselves. Who can say his heart is clean? there
is no man just, who sins not: and yet the Apostle is bold to affirm, That
he that is b^rne of God sins not. The just then transgress the Law, and so
are sinners: but they make not a trade of sin or profession of iniquity, and
so are not law-breakers or transgressors. And this the Apostle plainly
teaches, saying, James 2.10.
Every one that has this hope (of being the Son of God) does purge himself
as he is pure, 1. John 3.3.
not according to the measure of his purity or perfection, but according to
the truth, in habit becomes like unto him: as on the contrary he that commits
sin, 1. John 3.8.
that is, is a crafts-master of iniquity; and labors therein, he resembles
his Father the Devil, whose chief delight is in doing mischief. Which is
further confirmed by that of our Savior Christ to the Jews, John 8.34.
Verily, whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin: and the servant
abides not in the house for ever; but the Son abides forever: If the Son
therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. He that commits
sin with delight, wilful indulgence to transgressions, and unrelenting
opposition to the clear truth, he is the servant of sin, but they that are
made free by the Son, are free from the reign of sin, 1. John 5.18.
not from every act of sin. He that is borne of God keeps himself, that the
wicked one cannot come within him to endanger him, the gates of hell can have
no prevailing power over him; he sins not as the world does, which lies in
iniquity: but altogether free from sin he is not, nor ever shall be so long
as he carries about with him this body of death. To sin habitually,
wilfully, indulgently, with full consent and greediness is not compatible with
the hope and profession of a Christian: This spot is not the spot of Gods
children: Deuteronomy. 32.5.
but they have their blemishes, they sin of infirmity, though not of
wilfulness. Sin in it own nature is opposite to grace: but all sins are
not altogether incompatible with grace, that is, they hinder not the graceful
operation of faith, hope, and love. The remainders of Original corruption,
under which the regenerate must labor so long as they live: sins of simple
ignorance, and of unavoidable infirmity, which through weakness the faithful
run into every day: these do not stop the lively work of faith in receiving
the promises of mercy, but even at the very instant, when these have abode in
the soul, faith can and does make faithful plea for mercy, or otherwise none
could plead for mercy before the throne of Grace: For in many things we sin
all. James 3.2.
Sins of forgetfulness, inconsideration, and passion, whereunto there is not
advised consent, these are as moates in the eye, which do somewhat trouble the
clear sight of faith, but notwithstanding them, the heart principally
adheareth unto God: and though now and then through infirmity a Christian be
overtaken with them, yet may he upon good grounds be assured of Gods love.
Anger, pettishnesse, impatience, inordinate fear are sins which the godly
ought and do watch against, and for which they ought and must judge
themselves: but if through infirmity they be ouer-taken to speak an hasty or
unadvised word, they must not therefore cast off their confidence:
notwithstanding such slips, they may cry in faith, and be heard in their
supplications. If any man sin, 1. John 2.1, 2.
(to wit of infirmity, as they do who walk in the light, and addict
themselves to the serious study of holiness) we have an Advocate with the
Father Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.
What answer the Lord gave to Paul touching his temptations, My grace is
sufficient for thee: 2. Cor. 12.7, 8.
that may be said of the infirmities of the Saints, such sins as be mere and
absolute infirmities, God of his Grace, revealed in the covenant of grace, is
pleased to grant unto them a pardon of course. Such sins as in reg^rd of
their matter, are not repugnant to the maine offices prescribed by the
Commandments of God, being o^ fr^iltie committed, through unadvisedness or
sudden passion, these do not denominate a man a Law-breaker, nor so weaken the
power of faith, as that it should not be able to receive the promise of
forgiveness, nor suspen^ the actual claim of eternal life. These frailties
may be ^n the godly without any notable defect of faith: they debar not the
soul from cleaving unto God. Genesis 1^.13.
Abraham said of Sarah, She is my sister: this was an infirmity, but did not
extinguish faith. Sarah laughed at the promise, Genesis 18.10, 11.
and then denied it through fear: Jacob beguiled his Father, saying, I am thy
Son, Esau: Genesis 27.19. Exodus 4.10.14. Job 40 5. Math. 16.22. 2 Chronicles. 35.22.
2. Chron. 30.18, 19.
and many such like infirmities of the Saints are recorded, which argue their
faith to be weak, not to be deposed from it soueraignetie. The reason he^eof
is not to be taken from the matter or outward act, wherein they offended; but
from their heart and affection, which was more inclined to good then to evil,
and did stick fast unto God, even when through weakness they transgressed. By
faith Rahab received the spies with peace, Heb. 11.31.
when through infirmity she offended in the means of their safety. The
Prophet David was regenerate without question, and had sure hope that his
prayers for mercy should be heard, when he uttered this complaint of himself,
Psalm. 19.12, 13.
Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. K^epe
back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion
over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great
transgression. So that a faithful man stepping aside through infirmity in the
forenamed offenses; (I say through infirmity, and not o^ habit, custom,
gross carelessness or delight) does retain his integrity, and faith though
somewhat shaken, does keep it standing, and continue lively to beg and embrace
pardon. But he that sins of mere frailty, does humble himself for his daily
offenses and labor to repress and mortify his inbred lusts; seeks
forgiveness by unfeigned confession and hearty prayer, renueth his purpose and
resolution to be more circumspect, and sets up his watch to shun and avoid
the like sins for the time to come: And if he be overtaken at unawares he is
warned by that slip to look more heedfully to his ways beging pardon and
seeking help from above, that he may be able to stand fast: so that the
slip, which did seem somewhat to loose him, is an occasion of his sticking
faster and closer unto God.

. 12. But if a godly man fall into a foul and enormous crime wasting
conscience,. 12. What sins hinder assurance. Psa. 51.10 14. 1. Reg. 11.4.
for the time he loses some degree of newnes of Spirit, cleanness of heart,
comfort of the holy Ghost, integrity in a sort, and peace of conscience. He
plungeth himself into the sense of Gods wrath and displeasure, and by his
grievous transgression the power of faith is so weakened, that he can neither
believe the pardon of any one sin formerly pardoned, nor lay actual claim
to any privilege of grace formerly enjoyed. The favor of God toward his
children is unchangeable, the sentence of pardon granted shall never be
reuersed, even after some grievous fall, Psalm 37.24. Ioh. 10.28.29.30. John
8.35. 1. ^ohn 3.9.
the seeds of grace abide in them, and they remain in the state of
Justification: but whilst they continue in such an estate of sin, they can
make no actual claim to the promises of etern^ll life. The seeds of grace
abiding in them, they still retain their right and title to eternal life to
be given of free and undeserved grace: but they are suspended from actual
claim until they rise again by true repentance, and then they recover not a
new right or title, but a new claim by virtue of the old title. For it is the
perpetual ordinance o^ God, that if his children str ke out of the way by
sin, they m st rise again, and renew their faith and repentance, before they
can have any sound or true hope of salvation. There can be no Christian
assurance which does not fully consent and accord with these and such like
passages of hol^ S ripture: Psalm. 66.18. Ezekiel. 18.4.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me: The soul that
sins shall die. Know ye not, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicatours, 1. Cor. 6.9. Ephesians. 5.5.
Col. 3.5.6. Reu. 21.8.
nor idolat rs, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunka^ds, nor reuilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. If therefore a godly man, as
David, tu n^ asi e into sin of this kind, he can have no assurance of
mercy, till this iniquity be broken off by unfeigned repentance. For faith
cannot receive what the word of grace does not promise: Isay 1.16. Pro. 28.13.
1. Ioh. 1.6.7.
But pardon of sin is promised to them only that confess and forsake their
iniquity; that forsake all sin in habit, delight and indulgence gross sin
utterly and upon good advice.

. 13. The reign and absolute dominion Romans 6.12.13.14.
of sin does utterly exclude grace and he that is so guilty,. 13. The

has nothing in him that can cry or call for pardon or forgiveness. In whom
sin has this dominion, he as yet is under Ioh 3.36. Deuteronomy. 9 24 Mat. 7.23.
Number. 15.30.
the curse of the law, and the wrath of God abides on him: for the presence of
grace infused is a necessary qualificato the pardon of sin, and where sin
does bear such sway as to shut forth whatsoever in us should entreat mercy,
it does him up under wrath. Were it possible for a man regenerate (which shall
never befall them that are called according to the purpose of God) after grace
received to sin wilfully, with full consent, delight and contentment, to the
utter extinguishing of the Spirit of grace or finally to abuse any
extraordinary measure of inherent grace by indulgence to known sins secret
or open, he should fall from the state of Justification, and be called to a
strict account, as well for all his former sins, as this abuse of his talent.

. 14. Assurance of salvation, if true,. 14. True assurance breeds resolution
and care to please God. 1 Ioh. 3.22.
is ever joined with a religious and conscionable desire to walk before God in
all well-pleasing, and to do the things that are acceptable in his sight: and
assured standing in grace, depends upon a like certainty of not continuing
indulgence to known offenses, or gross negligence in repenting or bewayling
secret sins. Where this privilege is possessed the heart is most tender and
sensible of sin, most watchful to shun and avoid whatsoever is
displeasing unto his Highness greiued with holy indignation for former
loosenes and vntowardlines: Luk 7.47. 1. Ioh. 4.19. Cant. 5.8. and 8.7. 1. Pet.
1.8. Psalm. 103.1.2.3. 1. Cor. 14.1. Col 3.1.2. Phil. 3.9.
there flourishes unfeigned love to God for his mercy, and to the brethren for
the Lords sake; sound humility and free submission to the Lords will and
command in every thing; sincere and continual thankfulness to God for all
his gifts, both in prosperity and trouble, health and sickness; holy
couteousnes after spiritual things, joined with sound delight in the word of
God, and base account of all things in comparison of Christ: holy and reverent
admimiration to see his state thus changed, from so low a depth of misery, to
so great an height of glory: Psalm. 4.6.7. and 63.3. 1. Pet. 1.8. Act. 8.39.
Romans 5.4. Ier. 9.23.
sweet contentment, joy unspeakable, with continual care and constant
resolution, to better his obedience, and merciful zealous desire both by
edifying speech and godly example to draw on and build up others in faith and
godliness. How can it be conceived, that a man should be assured of the pardon
and forgiveness of many and great offenses committed by him, but it will work
a greater loathing and detestation of sin unfeigned abasement for former
wickedness, continual watchfullnesse to keep himself pure, and ardent love
with inward joy that cannot be expressed? How can a man be persuaded, that
greater happiness is given him of God then all the world is worth, that more
sins are pardoned him then he has hairs on his head, the least whereof is
sufficient to plung him into the nethermost Hell, but he must needs love the
Lord who has graciously looked upon him in his distress, rejoice with joy
unspeakable and glorious, and keep continual watch against the baits and
allurements of sin, that he loose not his comfort, nor dishonor God, who
has done so great things for him? The Malefactor is glad of his Princes
pardon, specially of his Highness favor, whereby he is advanced into great
honor and dignity. When the Jews heard of the proclamation of King Cyrus (by
which they were set free from their long and tedious captivity) they were rapt
with joy and wondering, Psa. 126.1.2.
that they were like to men that think they rather dream, then indeed
possess the thing that their souls longed after: how much more will certain
assurance, that we are set free from the perpetual bondage of sin, and
restored to the everlasting freedom of righteousness and life, make us wonder
at the infinite wisdom, and unspeakable goodness of our Heavenly Father?
The Saints considering the goodness of God toward Man in his creation, break
forth into holy admiration; Psalm. 8.4.5. Ioh. 7.17. Psalm. 144.3.
Lord, what is man that thou art so mindful of him The Prophet calling to
Mind long after, what God had done for his soul, in delivering him from the
terror of death, and power of the grave, cannot pass it over without fervent
thanks and praise, Psalm. 116.12.
What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits toward me. And when
Peter came to himself, and saw indeed that he was delivered from the tyranny
of Herod, from the deep dungeon and bitter death prepared for him, he entered
into a religious and thankful admiration of the great power and mercy of the
Lord, Act. 12.11.
saying* Now I know for a truth, that the Lord has sent his Angel, and has
delivered me from the hand of Herod. How much more ought and will that man,
who is assured of Gods favor and love toward him, for ever admire the mighty
power unspeakable goodness, and rich mercy of God, who has delivered him from
the pit of Hell, from the power of Satan, from the curse of the law, and from
the waiting for of all the wicked Devils and damned Spirits, and has
translated him into the kingdom of his dear Son. And if he daily consider
his unworthiness, and and renewed sins, he shall see more cause to wonder
every day, then at the first, if comparison may be made in such a case, and to
renew his repentance, care, watch, and resolution to better his obedience. For
is it not to be wondered at, that God pardons the sins of his children
daily, and continues his mercy toward them, and the sense of his love, even
unto the end. Who can think upon his slippes and infirmities, which break
from him every day, for which the wrath of God is iusty provoked against him;
and withal remmeber how God is pleased to spare him, to grant him access into
his presence, and to afford unto him the sense of his love; but he must needs
be astonished at the enioyment of so great and incomprehensible, so large and
long-enduring kindness? his heart must be enflamed with love, and enlarged in
praises still more and more, his affections raised to strive against sin, and
set upon the works of holiness and righteousness whereunto they are designed,
every day more and more? Assurance of sauation then does not beget security,
but quickens to more sincere, settled and constant obedience; nor it is
possible, that a Christian should hold his assurance longer then he does follow
cherish and feed this heavenly affection in himself.

CHAP. IX.
Faith is grounded upon the word of God, not upon the authority of the Church,
and rests upon God in Christ, not upon the Saints militant or triumphant.

. 1.
. 1. TThe Schoolmen divide the object of faith into the material object, and
into the formal. The material are the Articles or things believed. The
formal is the foundation and last maine principle whereupon faith relieth, or
that whereinto the assent, which yields unto the matter believed, is
resolved. In which sense, the object of faith is all one with the foundation or
ground work of it. But howsoever we understand it, whether for the maine reason
and last resolution of assent or for that whereupon our confidence leans,
relyeth, rests, the authority of the Church cannot be the ground, nor the
Saints tryumphant the object of faith divine. The Authority of the Church
cannot be the ground of faith. 1 Thessalonians. 2.13. 2. Tim. 3.16.
We believe that God has his Church: but we neither believe in the Saints
militant nor triumphant. The ground or foundation of faith must be some thing,
which is purely and simply divine, admixt with no error, yea subject to no
error; the indubitate word and revelation of Christ, the divine and prime
verity revealed by inspiration. But the word of God alone is purely and simply
divine admixt with no error, the Church is subject to error, neither has it
any truth immediately or by divine inspiration, Romans 11.20.
but by second means: the authority of the Church is a thing create, distinct
from the first verity. The immortal seed whereby we are regenerate and made
faithful, is the only formal principle or ground of faith. The word of God
alone is that immortal seed. Therefore the word of God alone, 1. Pet. 1.13.
is the only formal principle of faith. And even as in Husbandry, although
diverse instruments and means be requisite and necessary; to wit, plowing,
sowing, etc. yet the seed is the beginning and sole immediate cause of the
grain spinging up: even so in the spiritual plantation of faith, in which our
souls are living fields, the immortal seed which the Apostles first preached,
and afterward committed to writing, produces faith as the sole principle,
immediate motive, and formal object of faith: as the ministry, authority
and calling of the Church, produce the same as the adiuvant and isntrumental
cause, or as the means of applying the word and seals thereof, but not as the
first principle. Whatsoever credit the Church has, it receives the same from
the Scriptures, as is acknowledged by some of our principal Adversaries, and
confirmed by the Apostle, who says; Ephesians. 2.20.
We are built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles. The present
faith of Christians, is of the same kind with the faith of the Prophets and
Apostles. But the faith of these holy men was sounded upon immediate divine
revelation, and not upon the authority of the Church.

. 2. Herein the Romanists faith differs from the faith of ancient Christians;
for the Saints who lived of old, grounded their faith upon the pure and
faithful Word of God, 2. The Papists make the Popes authority the only ground
of Faith.
as upon a sure foundation, but the authority of the Pope, whom they call the
Church virtuall, is the first ground and last resolution of the Romanists
faith. Indefinitely or indeterminately, they teach, whatsoever God has spoken
is most true, in that sense wherein he me^nt it: But if we descend to any
determinate speeches, written or unwritten, either acknowledged or supposed for
God Word, the present Romish Church does take upon her absolutely to judge of
all, and every part of them. If we speak of that Canon of Scripture which we
have, the sense or interpretation of any text, any article of faith concluded
out of it, the only cause they do or can believe them infallibly, is the
Popes infallibility that commends them. The Churches or Popes proposal is not
only a condition requisite, but the remonstratiue root, the immediate cause and
reason of their believing divine revelations. And if it be a reason why they
believe them, and sway the mind to embrace the truth, then it is the proper
efficient cause of belief. According to their doctrine, the orthodoxall
answer to this Interrogation, Why do you believe the doctrine of the
Trinity, to be a divine Revelation? is, because the Church proposes it to me
for such. But he that admits this answer for sound and Catholic, and yet den
es the Churches proposal to be the true and proper cause of his belief in
the former point, has smothered the light of nature, by admitting too
artificial subtlety into his brains. Whatsoever it be, Cause, Condition,
Circumstance or effect, that truly satisfies this demand, Why do you believe
this or that? it is a true and proper cause of our belief though not of the
thing believed. We must here observe that there is a twofold resolution; One of
the things or matters believed or known into the^r first parts or elements;
Another of our belief or persuasions concerning them into their first causes
or motives. In the one, the most general or remotest cause; In the other, the
most immediate or next cause always terminates the resolution. The one
imit^tes, the other inuerts the order of composition. In the first acceptance,
the first verity or d^uine infallibility is that into which our faith is
lastly resolved. For this is the first step in the progress of true belief
the lowest foundation whereon any Religion can be built. But in the second
acceptance (as we always take those terms, when we resolve our own
persuasions) that is, for a resolution of all doubts or demands concerning the
subject whereof we treat: A Roman Catholics faith, must according to his
Principles, finally be resolved into the Churches or Popes inf^llibilitie. For
this is the immediate ground, or first cause of any particular determinate
point of Christian Faith: and the immediate is always that, into which our
persuasions concerning the effect, is finally resolved, seeing it can satisfy
all demands, doubts, or questions concerning it. It will not help them, to
color over the matter, and say, God revealing divine truth is the formal
object of faith: For seeing God works mediately, and reuealeth no truth unto
us but by external means: and divine authority in it self is hidden and
unknown: therefore the thing whereinto our faith is resolved, must be
something externally known, which we may read or hear. And our Adversaries
must lead us to secret revelation, which in words they pretend so much to
defy, or yield us an external foundation and formal object of faith: And
rejecting the Scriptures, whatsoever they gloss in words, they neither can,
nor do name us any other indeed, but the Roman Pope and Church. Nor will it
boot them ought to say, that Gods Word in the Churches mouth is the rule of
faith, whereinto it is finally resolved, seeing the Church defines nothing but
by Gods written or unwritten. For this is more then the party which belieues
it can know, nor has he any other motive to believe it, besides the Churches
definition or assertion. Suppose then we should conceive so well of a
temporal Judge, as to presume he did never speak but according to the true
meaning either of statute or customarie law: yet if we could not know either
the one or the other, or their right interpretation, but only by his
determinations; the law were little beholden to him (unless for a floute) that
should say, he were resolved jointly by the Judge and it. For seeing the Law is
to him altogether uncertain, but by the Judges auouchment or interpretation,
his last resolution of any act of Justice, must be only into the Judges skill
and fidelity. It is true indeed, that the Churches authority is not
comprehended in the object of belief, whilst it only proposes other Articles
to be believed. No more is the Sun comprehended under the object of our
actual sight, whilst we behold colors, or other visible things by the virtue
of it. But yet, as it could not make colors or other things become more
visible unto us, unless it self were the first visible, that is, unless it
might be seen more clearly then those things which we see by it, so we would
direct our sight unto it) so would it be impossible, the Churches infallible
proposal should be the reason of a Roman Catholics belief of Scriptures, or
their orthodoxall sense, unless it were the first and principal credible, or
primarie object of his belief, or that which must be most clearly, most
certainly, and most steadfastly believed, so as all other Articles besides, must
be believed by the belief of it. Nor is this proposal of the Church
necessary to the first plantation of faith only, but to the growth and
continuance of it; as well after faith is produced, whilst it continues, as
whiles it is in planting.

. 3. God and Christ (not the Church and Saints) is the only object of all true
confidence and trust. Esaias 26.34, Psalm. 130.5, 6, 7 and 22.5. Prou. 3.5. John
14.1. 1. Pet. 1.21. Romans 3.22. Psalm. 2.12. Ier. 17.5.
. 3. But to leave this mystery of Romish iniquity, and to return to the
matter the authority of the Church is not the ground of Christian faith, but
the holy Scriptures, and faith rests not upon the Saints, but upon Jesus
Christ. God and Christ is the object of confidence according to the Scripture.
God as the author and parent of all good things, of whom are all things, and
we in him: Christ as the only Mediator of God and Men, by whom are all
things, and we by him: or by whom God bestows upon us all saving blessings,
and by whom we come unto God. They are accursed, who make the arm of flesh
their stay, and trust in man, in whom there is no help or power. The present
faith of Belieuers has the same object with the faith of Adam after his fall
Abel, Abraham, Noah, David, the Virgin Marie, all the Patriarchs, Ephesians 4 4.
Heb. 13.8.
Prophets, and Apostles. For faith is one in object and kind, though different
in number and degree. But the confidence of Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, etc. was
exercised about, or directed unto God in Christ, not set upon any Saint.
Abraham and the rest, who lived before and under the Law, believed in the
Messiah to come: The Apostles and all the faithful since, believe in Christ
already come: But in nature the object of their faith is one and the same. Our
Adversaries confess thus much; Bellarmine proves Christ to be God, Bellar. de
Christ. lib. 1. cap. 5.
because it is written of him, Blessed are they that put their trust in him:
And the Scripture, says he, teaches every where, that we must put our trust
in the true God alone.

The Roman Catechism teaches, Catech. Romans part. 1. cap. 11. q. 19.
that we believe the holy Church, not in the Church: by which diverse form of
spe^king, say they, God the Creator is distinguished from things created.
Rhem. annot. in Romans 10.14.
But the Rhemists in defense of their Saint-inuocation, are driven to say, that
we are to trust in the Saints departed, and that the Scripture uses also this
speech, to believe in men, Exodus 14.31. 2. Chron. 20.21.
as They believed in the Lord, and in his servant Moses; Believe in the Lord,
and ye shall be established, etc. This is their first pretense, whereby they
seek to cover their Idolatry, whereas they might easily have known, that the
vulgar and the Seventy both translate these places, Deuteronomy. 28.66. Job 24.22.
Esaias 33.15. 1. Sam 27.12. John 3.5.
They believed Moses, and believe his Prophets: and not, they believed in
Moses, Believe in his Prophets. And it is certain, the preposition here added
in Hebrew, does not ever answer to In, in our language. What, that it is no
less then blasphemy to say, that the Israelites were commanded to put their
confidence in Moses and the Prophets, either as the principal authors and
parents of any good, or as Mediators betwixt God and them, by and through whose
mediation they should obtain all good things spiritual and temporal. For so
they should have made them their arm, who were but flesh. What is alleged out
of Exodus, Moses speaks in reproach of the Israelites, Ier. 17.5.
who believed neither the Lord, nor Moses touching the promise of their
delivery out of Egypt, until such time as they having quite passed the Red
Sea, did see their enemies dead in the Sea. And though they believed the truth
of the Lord, Psalm. 106.12.
and the word of his servant when they had the accomplishment of his promise;
yet they did not confidently betake themselves to the Lord, as their only
refuge, and rest under the shadow of his wings. For the Lord complains often
of their infidelity toward him; Psalm. 78 22. Heb. 3.1^.
and the history makes mention of their distrust, murmur^ng, and rebellion
against the Lord. In the other place the people are praised, as those who
rested in the word of the Prophet, before that the promise was effected: But
they leaned not upon the Prophets, as authors of their help, neither had that
been prayse-worthy in them, nay, it had been detestable Idolatry. If they
will have the Hebrew preposition to be of force in those places, by Moses and
the Prophets we are to understand the word taught by Moses, and the Prophets
from God; as the Chaldee explaineth it; they believed in the Word of the Lord,
and in the prophecy of Moses his servant. The exposition of both texts may be
taken out of that of the Lord to Moses, Exodus 19.9. John 5.45.
Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I
speak with thee, and believe thee for ever: that is, that they may receive
thee for a faithful and true Prophet, and believe in the word that I shall
make known unto them by thee. And as the Israelites are said to be baptized
into Moses, 1. Cor. 10.1.
that is, into the doctrine or law of Moses, whereof he was a Minister* so are
they said to believe in Moses and the Prophets, that is, in the word which they
taught from God. They were the instruments and Ministers of the Lord, and
ministerially the people believed in them, that is, in the Word of the Lord
published by them. Of Sion it is said, the poor of his people shall trust in
it. Esaias 14.32.
The meaning is not, that the faithful shall put their trust in Sion, as we
must hope in God: but that the inhabitants of Sion shall dwell in a quiet and
secure place; as the Prophets often affirm, that salvation is in Sion. Joel
2.32.
It may well be translated, The poor of his people shall betake themselves
unto it; Job 24.8. Psalm. 104.18.
as unto a place of protection and refuge by the blessing of God: not as unto
the chief stay and prop of their souls.

They further object, that the Apostle refers faith and love to the Saints,
saying; Phil. 5. verse. Bellar. de beatitud. Sanct. lib. 1. cap. 20. Verse 6.
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou have toward the Lord Jesus, and
toward all Saints. But in this place faith is referred only to Christ, and love
to the brethren, as it appears in the two verses next following. In the
former whereof faith is restrained unto Christ, and in the latter, the love
here mentioned is carried to the brethren: which appears also in that other
where upon the same occasion, he so distinguishes faith and love, that faith
is appropriated unto Christ, and love referred to the Saints. For the very
words also, the Apostle has so fenced them, Ephesians. 1.15. Col. 1 4.
that although the truth were not otherwise clear, our Adversaries can have no
advantage for their doctrine of pinning our most holy faith upon the sleeue of
every Saint.

For although he have coupled Charity and Faith together, which in other
Epistles he does distinctly refer the one to Christ, the other to the
faithful; yet he has used prepositions, which note that faith must pass no
f^rther then to Christ, as charity goes no further in this place, but unto
the Saints. For where the preposition [(...)] is such as might have served both
to note our faith toward Christ, and our charity toward our Brethren; he
declares that he would not have Faith and Charity carried to one and the same
object, by the choice of several bands of prepositions, wherewith to tie each
of these virtues with the subject whereunto they belong. But to go no further
then to the Rhemists translation, can they say, that we have charity in the
Lord Jesus? If with the later clause further removed, which is toward all
Saints, they will have both Charity and Faith conjoined, yet it follows much
more, that with this clause, in the Lord Jesus, which is nearer unto charity
then the other, they ought both also to be coupled. If this be absurd, much
more is it, that upon this ground of coupling Faith and Charity together, they
would have them both carried and applied unto these words, unto the Saints. As
for the order of words, and coupling things together, which are to be referred
distinctly, the like is to be found in other passages of holy Scripture. Math.
12.22.
Again, Love and Faith may be put for faithful, firm, and sted ast love; the
like whereunto we may often find. But by this no resting of the place, our
Adversaries are driven, not only to believe in the Catholic Church, but also
in every several member of the Catholic Church. For seeing the Apostle
commends Phi^^mon for his love toward every Saint that came unto him: it
follows, that if (as they say) he commends faith toward the Saints, he
commends it toward every man a part: and so every Christian is to believe in
other: which our Adversaries will not affirm.

CHAP. X.
Of the Effects, Subject and Degrees of Justifying Faith.

. 1. MAny and excellent are the fruits and effects of faith,. 1. The benefits
and effects of Faith.
for which cause it has been adorned with many singular titles of hohour. It
is called the gift of gifts, the soul of our soul, the root of an honest
life; the character of the sons of God, the key whereby the treasures which
are in Christ are opened unto us, the mother of sound joy, and nurse of a good
conscience: the hand whereby we apprehend Christ, the eye whereby we see the
invisible things of God, the mouth whereby we receive the seed of salvation;
the pledge of our eternal inheritance, the earnest of our peace with God, the
seal of our election, the ladder whereby we certainly and safely ascend up to
Heaven; the shield of a faithful soul, the sword whereby we beat and wound
our enemies, the token of our union in Christ, our victory, and the band
whereby we are united unto the chief good. The fruits of faith are divided
into two Heads; Internal and External, which the Schoolmen call Elicite and
Imperate* But to speak of them orderly as they are set down in Scripture, we
find them to be these. By faith we are engrafted into Christ, and made one
with him, Romans ^1.17. John 15.1. Ephesians. 5.30.
flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, l^uely members of that body,
whereof he is the head: and by Christ we are united unto God* In Scripture to
be in Christ, and to be in Faith are put indifferently. By faith we are
married unto Christ, Romans 8.10. 2. Cor. 13.3, 5. Hos 2.18, 20. Acts 10 43. Romans
3.25, 28. Acts 13.3^. Romans 9.32. and ^.17. and 5.1, Acts 15.9. Col. 2.12. Gal.
3.7.9. John 1^.36. Gal. 3.20. John ^.1^ Heb. 11.6. John 7.38, 39 Eph^s. 1.13,
17. Gal. 3.14. John 15.3, 5. John 1.16. and 15.6.
and have communion with him in his Death and Resurrection, he and all his
benefits are truly and verily made ours; his name is put upon us, we are
justified from the guilt and punishment of sin, we are clothed with his
righteousness, we are sanctified against the power of sin, having our
nature healed and our hearts purified: we draw virtue from him to die to sin,
and live to righteousness. By faith we are admitted into the Family of
Abraham, become the children of l ght, are adop^ed to be the Sons of God, are
made acceptable unto him as heirs of life, unto whom he wills eternal
blessedness, and do receive the promise of the Spirit. By faith we abide in
Christ, and have perpetual communion with him. It is the loadstone that looks
ever to Christ, as that does toward the North: and as that draws iron unto
it, so does faith join our hearts to Christ perpetually. By faith we receive
of Christ's fullness; have profession of him do live in him, and are so
refreshed by him, that we shall never wither or feel scarcity. Gal. 2.20.
John 4.14.
Water in a ditch may be dried up, so cannot the pond which is fed with
continual springs. Ephesians. 3.17. Ephesians. 3.12. Heb. 10.22. and 4.14. Tit. 1.15. 1.
Pet. 1.5. 1. Ioh. 5.4.
By faith Christ dwells, and rules in our hearts, we have access to the
throne of grace, the temporal gifts of God are sanctified unto us, all
spiritual blessings are continued and augmented in us, and we are kept to the
salvation to be revealed. Faith overcomes the world; the manifold ill
examples of the multitude, which like a raging stream bears down all before
it, and the alluring sweet baits of the deceitful enchanting world, which
are most strong and dangerous; even whatsoever within us or without us would
draw from the law of God: Ephesians. 6.16. Pet. ^.8. Math. 8.13. 1. Ioh. 5.14. Genesis
32.26. Heb. 4.2. Romans 1.16. Mark. 16.16. Romans 5.5. and 10.11. 1. Pet. 2.6.

8.26. Gal. 4.6. Rom 8.15. Gal. 6.14. Ephesians. 5.11. Heb. 11.8.23.
it quenches the fiery darts of the Devil, puts Satan to flight, and
keeps us safe from the mighty adversary of our souls and salvation. Faith
obtains of God what we ask agreeable to his will, prevails with him,
makes the ordinances of God sweet and comfortable, receives what is proffered
in the word and Sacraments, and makes that we shall never be ashamed nor
confounded. Faith increases knowledge, enflameth the heart with love stronger
then death, hotter then coals of Juniper, which cannot be quenched with much
water; stirs up earnest sighs and groans, enlarges the heart in
thankefulnes and holy admiration, blows and quickens zeal, renounceth
Satan and all his works, crucifieth the flesh with the affections and lusts,
contemns the world, scorneth the base and transitory pleasures or profits,
whereby it does allure to withdraw from God, and dispiseth the frowns,
threats, and utmost wrongs that it can do, in respect of the love of God and
Christ Jesus, or hazarding his part in the eternal happiness. It armeth with
patience and invincible constancy, breeds peace of conscience and joy
unspeakable, Romans 5.1. 1. Pet. 1.7. 2. Cor 1 9. Phil. 1.25.
makes valiant in the combat striving against sin, courageous in
difficulties, confident in desperate dangers; is accompanied with holy
security concerning the grace, Rom 14.7. 1. Pet. 1.8. John. 8.56. 2 Timothy 1.12.
Heb. 11.34.35. 2. Chro 14.11. and 20.12. 1. John. 3.21. Luk 7.50. Ephesians. 2.8.

protection and love of God, joined with a certain expectation of eternal
salvation, and assurance that all things shall work together for best. It
seasoneth prosperity, receives earthly blessings as pledges of Gods special
and Fatherly love, and lifteh them up to spiritual use: it sweetens
afflictions, supporteth under them, teaches to profit by them, bears them
meekly, expects deliverance, and triumphs before the victory. It sees
things invisible, assures above likelihood; sense or reason, allayeth
perplexing thoughts and fears, and breaks off temptations. It stays upon
the word of promise, and is confident of things, to reason incredible, in
nature impossible, to sense direct contrary, because God has said them. It
preserves from ill means, labors conscionably in the duties of our
callings, yet without covetousness or distracting care; swalloweth the
painfulnesse of honest labor, and obtains many temporal blessings and
deliverances, Dan. 6.^3. Ier. 39.18. Romans 11.20. Romans 10.10. 2. Cor. 4.13. 1.

yea and spiritual privileges for our selves, for our prosterie, and for
others. Faith preserves from falling, raises us again being fallen, makes
courageous and hardy in the profession of the Gospel, even to the loss of
goods, liberty, and death it self: it sweeteneth the communion of Saints,
linketh the heart in love to them that fear God, labors the conversion of
them that go astray, and the building forward of them that be called, and the
comfort of them that be distressed in soul or body; makes profitably to those
that be without, works righteousness, obtains a good report, and wholly
resigneth it self to the will of God. And to conclude, by faith we are
certified of our election, are made wise unto salvation, do stand in grace,
are assured of prosperous success in what we go about, do learn how to
want and how to abound, and possess all things when for the present we have
nothing in hand: are enriched with many spiritual graces, are kept to our
Heavenly inheritance, and shall b^e glorified in the life to come. These be the
sound, comfortable, enduring fruits of faith, in which respect who can but say,
that faith is an excellent grace? a rich jewel, a pearl of price, the
Christian man's treasure? Faith is a principal thing, the merchandise thereof
is better then silver, and the fruits thereof then fine gold. Without faith
there is no plenty to man on earth: with faith there can be no want of any
thing that is good. For how can he lack any good thing, who has God for his
Father, Christ his Savior, the holy Ghost his sealer and Comforter, the Angels
to guard him, Heaven his inheritance: who has Gods faithful promise confirmed
by oath and seal, to secure him of all things needful, grace, comfort and
earthly blessings, and is kept by the power of God unto salvation? But here it
must be observed, that faith does not effect and perform these things, by any
excellency, force, or efficacy of it own above other graces but in respect
of the office whereunto it is assigned in the Covenant of grace. It is a cause
only Isntrumental, and that is atributed unto it, which the principal cause
works. Faith iustifies not as an act or quality, but as it receives Christ:
faith purifieth not the heart of it self, but as it is the instrument whereby
the Spirit works. Whatsoever we are made by faith, we are made it in Christ
and whatsoever faith makes to be ours, it is also in Christ. Therefore faith
makes not God to be our God, but in Christ: nor us the children of God, but in
Christ. And whatsoever grace is wrought in the heart of any man, it is the gift
of God, the work of the holy Ghost: but faith is the Instrument whereby the
Spirit does more renew and purify our hearts.

. 2. Of all creatures only Man is capable of saving or justifying faith:. 2.
Of all creatures Man only is capable of Justifying faith 2. Pet. ^.4.
not the blessed Angels who never sinned; nor the evil Angels, who are shut up
in prison, and reserved in chains of darkness against the day of judgment.
The Saints in glory do enjoy immediate fellowship and communion with God by
sight, and know most perfectly and most clearly: But the light of Justifying
faith, which does include and suppose imperfection, pertains to this life in
which we are in the way moving to perfection, not yet attained unto perfect
vision. So that faith is proper unto Man in this life, in his journey toward
his perfect home and eternal habitation: but all men are not enriched with
this precious gift of mercy, and rare jewel of grace. All men have not faith.
2. These. 3.^. Isay 53.1. Math. 11.25. and 13.11. Romans 9.18.
Many are not so much as outwardly called, the sound of the Gospel has not
reached unto them: many that hear, understand not, be not affected with the
truth: and in some that be affected, the word takes not kind rooting, is not
well planted. Those to whom faith is given are described to be the elect of
God, the sheep of Christ, Tit. 1 1. Act. 13.48. Romans 11.5. Ioh. 10.11.15.26.
Ioh. 6.37.39. and 20.39. and 17.2.6. Math. 1.21. and 18.11.
and to be given of the Father unto Christ. The subject of Justifying faith is
man a sinnner, called according to the purpose of God, acknowledging his
offenses, and hungring and thi^sting after mercy. For none but a sinner can
acknowledge Christ for his Savior for he is the Savior of sinners. Faith in
Christ for remission of sins, is necessary for them only who have offended:
but every sinner cannot believe, every one is not fit to receive the promise of
mercy. The enemies of the Gospel of Christ, worldings, hypocri^es, and all in
whom sin reigns, can have no true faith in Christ: Math. 11.28. Mark. 1.15.
he only is fit to embrace mercy, who knows that he is lost in himself,
and unsatiably desires to be eased of the heavy burden of his sins. Faith is
not a work natural, but supernatural, not of nature, but of grace, not of
the power of our free will, but of the efficacy of Gods Spirit, whereby we
answer to the effectual call of God, and come unto him, that we might be
pertakers of life eternal. 1. John 5.1. John 1.12.13. Ioh 6 44.
The infusion of faith is necessarily precedent to the act of faith, and grace
to believe is given before we lay hold upon Christ. And if sauing-effectuall
calling be precedent to faith, the subject of living faith is man sauingly
called according to the purpose of Gods will. We can teach no faith to
salvation, but according to the rule of Christ; Repent and believe the Gospel;
Mar. ^ 15. Luke 24.47. Act. 2.37.38.
no remission of sins, but according to the like rule: But faith seeks and
receives pardon as it is proffered in the word of grace. Repentance is
necessary to the pardon of sin, as a condition without which it cannot be
obtained, Luke 13.3. 1. Ioh. 1.9. Act. 11.18.
not as a cause why it is given. If mercy should be vouchsafed to all
indifferently, the grace of God should be a boulster to Man's sin; there
should be no difference betwixt the just and unjust, the pen^tent and
obstinate. Faith comes to Christ as an humble penitent petitioner, suing to the
throne of grace for what is promised in the Gospel, and it receives according
to the promise of mercy.

. 3. Faith resideth both in Mind and Will.
. 3. The seat of faith is the heart, but the heart contrite, humbled,
bewailing sin, denying it self, and affected with desire of remission of
sins. As the stomach is the place in which meat is received; but it is
necessary it be desirous of meat: So the heart is the place, where remission
of sins is received and felt, but it must be an heart desirous of, and
thirsting after pardon. With the heart man belieueth. Romans 10.10. Act. 8.37. 2.
Pet. 1.19. Act. 16.14.
If the Mind and will be two distinct faculties of the soul, then justifying
faith is resident in both, but principally in the will: because it assenteth to
divine revelation as true, and embraces the promises as much better then any
contrary good, the world, the Devil, or flesh can present to prevent our
choice of what it prescribes for our saving health. For the word of promise
not only containing truth, but offering good unto us, cannot fully be received
with the understanding, but the will also must move toward it. And so faith is
not only a knowledge or assent in the Mind but, a godly affection in the
will, which does go to, embrace, rest upon Christ or the grace offered in
Christ. Therefore the nature of faith is described by words which signify to
stay and roll our selves upon God, to l^ane on him as one would lean upon a
staff: and by faith we come unto Christ and receive him. It is objected, that
one and the same virtue or grace cannot be in distinct powers and faculties of
the soul, Bellar. de Iustif. l 1. cap. 6. Haec. Philosophia.
nor faith in distinct subjects. Whereunto several answers are made, First,
that one and the same thing in diverse respects may be referred to diverse
subjects, as these subjects are not altogether separated, but conjoined amongst
themselves. So friend-ship is one moral virtue, and yet in the Mind and will
both. Love and hatred is noth ng but the affection of good or evil will unto a
thing known in the understanding. Our Adversaries themselves place hope in the
understanding and the will, Bellar. de Just. lib. 3. cap. 11.
attributing a double certainty unto it, one in respect of the understanding,
another in respect of the will. And so faith being one does properly possess
one subject, to-wit, the soul; but considered according to the two faculties
thereof, it possesses the Mind, as it understands and assenteth; the will,
as it receives embraces the word of promise. Secondly it is answered, that
saving faith does presuppose knowledge and assent as the root and foundation:
but formally it is an affection, toward the promise of grace, and seated in
the heart. As the reasonable soul does give life, sense and motion as inferior
operations: so justifying faith does know and assent, but as justifying it
does trust and rely upon the mercy of God in Jesus Christ. Thirdly,
Justifying faith, or faith as it iustifyeth, is not one virtue, not any virtue
but iustifyeth only as it makes us partakers of the righteousness of Christ;
which it does not by any dignity or excellency of it own, but in respect of
the place and office which our merciful God has freely and liberally granted
unto it. Now nothing hinders why God should not give the name of faith both to
assent in the understanding, and to affyance in the will, and require both to
Justification. And that it is not a virtue as it iustifyeth, is manifest
hereby, that we are justified by the act of faith, not by the habit of faith,
as Divines popish and protestant confess. But if Mind and will be indeed but
two names or titles of one and the same intellectual nature, as truth and
goodness in matters moral differ only in degrees of apprehension, then there
is no room for this objection. 1. Reg. 3.9. 2. Cor. 3.15. Act. 7.39 and 11.23.
1 Cor. 7.37. Math. 6.21. Romans 1.24. Ioh. 14.1. Luke 1.66. and 21.14. Math.
12.35. Math. 13.14.15. Ioh. 24.25. and 4.11. Psalm. 10. Pro. 3.5 20. 1. Ioh.
5.1. Romans 10.8. 1. Ioh. 5.4.5.20. verse. 1. John 2.4. Psalm. 78 22. Psalm.
137.4.5. Neh. 6.14 and 13.14.29. John. 17.3. Heb. 4.2.3. Eccl. 12.1.
Not to dispute this point any further, this is manifest, that in Scripture the
heart is taken for the whole soul, with all its powers and operations; as of
understanding, willing and choosing, remembering or retaining in Mind and
affecting, that the Scripture does simply attribute to the heart knowledge,
confidence and affection; and that the Scripture has no peculiar words,
whereby that philosophical distinction of Mind and will may be confirmed: and
therefore according to the sentence of Scripture, we may seal faith in the
heart or reasonable soul and not trouble our selves about the distinction of
the faculties. If the Scripture mention this as an act of faith, To believe
that Christ is the son of God, which is seated in the Mind; it must be
remembered, that words of knowledge do together by connotation imply affection,
much more words of belief: and therefore where we find to believe that
Christ is the son of God, we must conceive this belief to contain
confidence in the Son. Words of knowledge most usually import, not idle
knowledge in the Mind, but true and unfeigned affections in the heart, which
accompany that knowledge. Knowledge is the ground of confidence, and so it is
put for confidence which it does bring forth. The whole intellectual nature is
the seat of faith and that faith which iustifyeth is well-rooted and takes
kindly in the soul, otherwise it could not season the whole lump, disperse it
virtue into every affection, command every passion, and bring into subjection
whatsoever does make head against the power of godliness. Faith that is not
well planted can neither soundly receive, nor firmly hold Christ, but by the
allurements of the world, the lusts of the flesh, and assaults of Satan it is
easily ouer-turned. The stony ground received the seed, but wanting good root
it withered, and brought forth no fruit to ripeness. Whilst faith possesses
the castle of the soul, it can as easily overcome the assaults of the Flesh,
the World, and the Devil, as honest subjects which hold the heart of the
Kingdom, can vanquish and bring under the scattered forces of an enemy, that
makes inrodes upon the borders. But if the heart be taken up with wordly
delights, or vain lusts be suffered to build their castle therein, then shall
we be made a prey to Satan. The cares of the world and pleasures of this life
choke the seed of life received, that it brings forth no fruit unto perfection.

. 4. This faith wel-rooted is common to all,. 4. Faith is peculiar to them, who
be called according to the purpose of God. Ephesians. 4.5. 2. Cor. 4.13. Math. 9.2.
2 Pet. 1.1. 1. Pet. 1.7. Romans 1.17. Gal 2.^0. 1. John 3.23. Hab 2.4 John 20.27.
Acts 16.31. and 19.^. Mark 11.22. John 14.1. 1 Pet. 1.7. Heb. ^1.6, 7, 8, 9,
10. etc. Gal. 3.26. Acts 8.37.
and proper to them only who be called according to the purpose of God. All
that be sauingly-effectually called, and they only are partakers of the same
faith in subject, object, kind, but not in number and degree. Every Belieuer
has a proper, singular, sincere, individual faith, in kind the same, but in
number differing from the faith of others; as the faith of Peter was distinct
from the faith of the other Disciples. The just does live by his own faith: A
special and particular faith is required in every one that shall be saved.
This particular faith is commended by the holy Ghost in particular faithful
men and women: And when the faithful of age and discretion were admitted to
Baptism, they professed particularly their faith in Christ. Health of body
and such like outward blessings, may be conferred by God upon one for the
faith of another. And the children of Christian parents are within the covenant
for their parents faith, as the promise is made to the faithful and to their
seed, and they receive it for themselves and their posterity. And generally
the faith of one may help to obtain for another, James 5.14, 15. Phil 1.19.
Ephesians. 6.18. 2. These 3^.
so far as it moves to pray for others. But rem^ssion of sins and
salvation is not obtained without a proper and special faith in them that be
of ripe yea es, and have the use of reason. God takes no pleasure in them who
withdraw themselves by unbelief. Heb. 10.38.


. 5. All have not like measure of faith. Romans 12 3. Math. 8.10. and 15.28.
Math. 6.30. and 8.26. and 14.31. and 16.8. Mark 9.24. Romans 4.20. Romans 14.1.
and 15.1.
. 5. The faith which is believed is one and the same, the grace whereby we
believe supernaturally infused, the seat of faith an humbled and contri^e
heart, but the measure of faith is not equal or like in all. To some is given
a greater measure of faith, to others a lesser: faith is more strong in this
Christian, more weak in that. There is a great faith, and a little faith; a
strong faith, and a weak faith. All living trees in an Orchard be not of one
growth or fruitfulness: All men be not of one stature, estate, or age* but
some high, some low, some rich others poor; some strong to labor, others that
must be borne or held up by the arms: and so it is in the Church of God
amongst Christians. All good ground is not equal in yielding fruit, Faith
perfect in none. 1. These. 1 7, 8. Compared with 1. These. 3.10. 1. Tim. 1.5.
Phil. 3.15.
some returns an hundred-sold, some thirtie-fold. Such perfection of faith is
granted to no man in this life, that neither he nor any other can be more
perfect therein. The faith of all the elect is sincere; the faith of some
perfect in comparison of others: but absolutely the greatest faith is imperfect
Justifying faith supposes imperfection, and is it self imperfect in us so
long as we live in this world. It is imperfect extensiuely in regard of things
to be believed; and intensiuely, in respect of confidence, wherewith we
believe in Christ. We know nothing as we should, of those things which we
know: and many things we are ignorant in, 1. Cor. 13.12. Mark 8 24.
which we should know. We are like the blind man, whose eyes now opened, began
to see men like trees. Look as children know not at all many things, they come
to know afterward; so we: and look as they do not fully know those things
which they know, but superficially; so is it wi^h us in heavenly matters. Hence
our confidence cannot be perfect. Psalm. 9.10.
For those who know God best, trust him b^st: those who dimely know him, his
goodness and truth, they can but weakly believe on him. In speculatiue
knowledge pertaining to discourse they may far excel, who come short in
confidence: but in certain, distinct, practical knowledge they are most
excellent, that with most lively affiance do cleave unto the Lord. Again, the
mysteries of faith are so profound, that in this life we cannot attain unto
the understanding of them fully and perfectly, 2. Cor. 10.15. 2. These. 1.3.
Ephesians. 1 17, 18. and 4.29. Col. 1.9, 10.
but have need to pray daily, that the eyes of our Mind may be opened, that
we may more fully conceive of the things that pertain to the Kingdom of God.
And if our eye be dim in sight, our hand is feeble in receiving. For our
will is as much corrupt as the understanding: and it is easier to discern the
truth, then firmly to embrace it against all oppositions. The darkness of
Mind is an impediment to full and perfect knowledge: the corruption of will,
which is never wholly removed in this life, is a stop and let to perfect
confidence. Faith grows and increases by degrees, which is an argument, Romans
1.17.
that in this life it never comes to the highest pitch of perfection: For that
which is already complete in degree, needs no augmentation. What Belieuer
is there, who finds not a continual combat of faith against many temptations
arising from his native ignorance, infidelity, diffidence, Psalm. 73.1, 2. and
30.6, 7, 8.
the wisdom of the flesh, his own sense and feeling, etc. which assaults
against faith from within do argue the weakness, as the resistance of them
demonstrates the the truth of faith. The tree is known by its fruit, and the
goodness of a cause by the effects it produces. But the fruits of faith are
imperfect; as love, joy, and holiness. The faith of Abraham was great and
excellent, but not perfect in degree: He was strong in faith, and doubted not
of infidelity, but of infirmity he doubted: His faith remained invincible,
though often assaulted, but now and then it was shaken.

. 6. The faith of the weakest Christian is sufficient to salvation.
. 6. The strongest faith is imperfect, but the measure of faith is so divided
by divine providence, that to none who are called according to his purpose, is
given less then what may suffice to their salvation. The measure of faith
contains this in it, that it be a sufficient portion for every one. God in
his wise providence gives the greatest measure of faith to them, who are to
undergo the greatest combats. Ht has appointed some for the example of
others, and in them he propounds to the world certain tokens of his glory
and virtue: and therefore he bestows upon them a more abundant measure of
faith, not that they might acquire by it more salvation, but that they might
singularly serve for the illustrating of the glory of God, and be an help,
comfort and support to the weak. In the body humane the bones have more
strength then the flesh, not that there is more life in them but that they
might sustain the weak flesh: so here. There is no member of the body so
weak, if it be endued with the Spirit of life, which is not as well a true and
lively member of the body, as they which are better and more excellent: so the
weakest Belieuer is a lively member of Christ, as truly as they that are more
strong in faith.

. 7. The degrees of true and lively faith. 7. The degrees of faith.
may be considered according to the diverse growth, which God brings his
children unto, and the diverse measure of grace; which God bestows upon them;
according to the time wherein they have been trained up in the school of
Christ, the means God has vouchsafed for their building forward, their
experiments of his love, and their care to use the means and employ their
talent. God gives not the same measure of grace to all Belieuers: all be not
of equal standing in Christ's school, nor of equal pains to improve what
they have received, nor live under like powerful means of grace, and enjoy
like helps of increase in strength. In nature no man wonders to see a grown
man stronger then a newborn babe; a plant set in a mellow and fertile garden
thrive faster then that which grows in a more barren soil; a Merchant that
is wary and industrious to employ his stock, to increase more then he that
is remiss; an old beaten Soldier to be more expert then one who has newly
put on his armor: In grace the same holds good; for faith thriueth according
to the time, means, experiments, and one we take to improve our talent and
preserve our faith. The degrees of faith may fitly be drawn into four Heads.
For there is a weak faith as it were in the tender bud; Four degrees of Faith.
a faith somewhat grown up: strong faith, and full assurance.

Faith is weak four ways: 1. Weak.
when a Belieuer is but a babe in understanding, ignorant of many profitable
things needful to be learned and practiced. Faith is weak in four respects.
Romans 14.1. and 15.1. Heb. 5.11.12. 1. Cor. 8.10. Math. 16.16. Luke 9.45. Mark
9.9. John 20.9. Mark 16 11. John 14.5.
Him that is weak in faith, receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.
The Disciples had true faith, when they were very weak in knowledge. For
though they believed that Christ was the Messiah, yet they were ignorant of his
Death and Resurrection, and Ascension. When he told them of his sufferings,
they understood not that saying; when Mary told them of his Resurrection, they
believed it not; when he spoke of his tarrying with them a little, and then of
going unto his Father, they knew not what it meant.

Lord, I believe, help mine unbelief. Mark 9 24.


though he feel that he hangs but weakly, discern not the certainty of his
estate, nor the stablenesse of Gods promises, cannot assure himself that he
does believe, is soon discouraged in troubles, and ready to faint if help
come not presently. Math. 8.26. and 14.31.
But when the mind is perplexed with temptations, fears, and doubts, and the
heart ready to faint, not able with clear evidence to receive the promises,
yet then this true Belieuer is habitually resolved (not without great dread and
wavering) that it is good to trust and wait upon the Lord. Psalm. 73.28.
And this must be remembered for certain, that howsoever faith be often
shaken, oppressed with fears, or turned aside with oppositions that be made
against it, for a time, as the Disciples did all forsake our Savior and flee,
Math. 26.56.
when he was apprehended; yet the weakest faith is advisedly resolved to stick
fast unto the promises of life, as much better then the pleasures or profits of
this life, and to embrace Christ notwithstanding any opposition by allurement
or terror that the Devil, the World, or the Flesh can make against it.

Ordinarily belieuers are weak at the first.
lively practice of holiness. Ordinarily this is the state of Belieuers at
their first conversion; and who can expect it should be otherwise: We do not
look that a newborn babe should be able to go alone; if strength come with
age, we think it is well. And thus it fares with them also, who are not
conscionable to gain knowledge, subdue their corruptions, cherish faith,
nourish the motions of Gods Spirit, pray earnestly, watch narrowly, get
resolution of their doubts, tie up their passions, renew their repentance and
purpose to better obedience.

Some privileged above others.
But some there are, whom God in special manner does privilege at one time,
and in one day to receive that grace and gift of assurance, which others are
long laboring and traveling for, before they attain it. As our Savior
Christ pronounces of Zacheus, Luke 19.9.
This day is this Man become the Son of Abraham, and salvation is come into
his house. So Lydia her heart was opened, Acts 16.14.
that she attended to the preaching of Paul: the Iaylour, and the Jews who
were pricked in conscience at the preaching of Peter, Acts 16.34. and 2.38.
Math. 9.9. Luke 22.43. Faith weak in one respect may be strong in another.
Heb. 11.31.
were quickly comforted after they were thrown down. The like may be said of
Matthew, and the thief who was converted upon the Cross.

Again, faith may be weak or small in one particular, when it is great and
strong in another. The measure of knowledge may be scant, when affiance is
strong, according to that a man does know, as in Rahab: where there is small
assurance of pardon, there strength of faith may discover it self by striving
against doubting, bitter complaining for want of feeling comfort, fervent
seeking to be settled in believing, earnest longing after and insatiable desire
of grace, high prizing and valuation of Jesus Christ, and mercy promised in
him; self-denial, contempt of the world, care to search out the sin that
may possibly hinder comfort, and expel it, continual watchfulness and holy
jealousy lest they should be deceived, and faithful laboring to subdue
corruption. These and such like fruits of sound, lively, wel-rooted affiance
may be seen in many that be troubled with manifold fears and doubts of
their own salvation, though they themselves do not ever perceive, how God
has enriched them.

. 8. A weak and strong faith differ not in special nature and plantation, but
in degree:..8 The benefits of the weakest faith, if true and lively. Romans 11.20.
and the fruits of weak and strong faith are the same, though not in like
measure, fullness and comfort. More distinctly the benefits of the weakest
lively faith be these: By it the Belieuer is firmly and inseperably knit unto
Christ, as a living member unto the Head. A true Belleuer, though never so
we^ke, John 14 17. and 6.35. ^phes. 3.17. 1. John 5.20. Heb. 1^.1.
does possess Christ with all his benefits, and all sufficiency in him (for
knowledge of faith is never without p^ssession.) And so he is justified,
sanctified, adopted, and made free by Christ. By faith he apprehends things
invisible, he does see God, and is made wise unto salvation* John 17.3. and 6
54* Col. ^.12, 13. Romans 6.4, 5.
Eternal life is already begun in every Belieuer weak and strong, even
that life which shall never fade. The weakest faith gives will and ability in
some sort to walk uprightly, and to live honestly in the sight of God and Man:
it is also strong through the power of Christ to vanquish Satan and overcome
the world, 1. John 5.4.
with whatsoever is therein that makes head against the soueraignetie of
grace. John 7.37 38. Romans 11.29. Romans 1.17.
The weakest faith is ever joined with the gift of perseverance, and cannot
utterly be broken off. And weak faith, if found, will grow and increase, as a
child now feeble in his joints, may in time become strong by nourishment, Yet
should we strive to be strong and rich in faith.
and able to run about. It is no wisdom therefore for any man to content
himself with a little faith, though the weakest faith shall never fail, nor
be overcome by Satan, seeing God has provided and does afford means, whereby
we may be builded forward. It is a shame to be a man in years and a b^be in
knowledge: to be an Infant in faith, when God vouchsafes time and means of
better stature. Who would be poor that might be rich? weak that might be
strong? who would live in fear and care, that might rest confident and secure?
who would walk pensiuely, that might continually rejoice and triumph? A weak
faith will bring to salvation, but a strong faith is necessary for a
Christian, that he may overcome with more ease, fight more manfully, endure
with patience, and obey with cheerfulness. The least dram of faith is more
precious then gold that perishes, better then the whole world, who, that
knows the price and value of such a jewel, would not desire and labor to be
furnished with it, and grow rich therein. In earthly things a full estate
pleases best: in heavenly shall we be contented to l^ue from hand to mouth,
and scarce that, when we might with better allowance enjoy plenty? All living
things have an appetite to seek and desire nourishment for increase unto
perfect stature in their kind: Herbs and plants suck juice out of the earth;
newborn babes d sire the mother breast. All true graces are still growing
from a gram of Mustard seed to a great tree; Math. 13.31, 32
and lively faith does covet increase from feeble state to better growth, from
growth to strength, from strength to full assurance.

. 9. Faith somewhat grown is,. 9. 2. Somewhat grown.
when the Belieuer is better acquainted with the doctrine of salvation, gives
more full, absolute and unlimited assent to the word of truth then formerly,
cleaves faster to the promises of mercy, in Jesus Christ, is better
stablished in the practice of godliness, and has obtained some settled
boldness, and confidence at sometimes, though he be still ignorant of many
privileges which he might enjoy, and of which he might be assured by the grace
and bounty of the Lord; yea through weakness he wauereth often, doubts
again and again, and becomes like the smoking flax.

Strong faith excels the former in certain knowledge, firm and full
assent, 3. Strong.
lively confidence joined with sincere purpose and resolution of impartial and
constant obedience. This Belieuer is better acquainted with the promises of God
temporal and spiritual to rely upon them, he can wrestle earnestly in
prayer, is not discouraged if for a time his suite be denied, will take no
repulse, is courageous in dangers, sharpened by difficulties, Math. 15.28. and
8.10.
walks on constantly in a godly course, and holds the confident assurance
of his salvation more strongly, and has it more usually then the two former.
But yet he has not learned in every state and thing so to live by faith, but
that he is often shaken and troubled with his corruptions, distracted with
cares, and kept under with other encumbrances more then he need, if he had
attained to that measure of faith, which in this life many have obtained by the
gift of God. 4. Full assurance. Coloss. 2.2. Romans 15.14. Coloss. 1.23. Romans
4.20. Psalm. 27.1.23.4. Job 13.15. Ester 4.14.
Full assurance is, when the Belieuer has obtained full assurance of
understanding in the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ and
assuredly belieueth in Christ for salvation, and is certainly persuaded that
all other promises spiritual and temporal do belong unto and shall be made
good unto him in due season, though in appearance all things go clean
contrary: and readily follows the Lords commandment, though repugnant to
flesh and blood, cross to carnal reason, contrary to earthly pleasure and
contentment. Gotten by degrees. 2. Cor. 1.7.
This degree of faith is not gotten at once, nor at first ordinarily, but by
degrees, after good time and continuance in the use of the means, after many
experiences of Gods love and favor, after manifold trials and combats, and
the long continued practice of holiness; many never attain unto it in this
life: but it is the duty of every Christian to labor after good establishment
and full assurance in the faith.

Heb. 6.11. Col. 2.11. The Benefits of full assurance.
As faith is more excellent, so are the fruits that issue from it: The stronger
our faith the more firm and close is our union with Christ. A weak belieuer
is as truly knit to Christ as the strong, but not so nearly and fast. The
increase of faith makes our Communion with Christ more sweet and comfortable
then before. For the more steadfastly we believe, the clearer apprehension have
we of the remission of all our sins; the more virtue and strength draw we
from Christ to kill and crucify our corruptions; the greater is our peace and
joy in the sense of Gods special favor and the more constantly inioyed with
an increase thereof. Romans 15.13. 1. Ioh. 1.^. Romans 5 1.2.3. Heb. 10 22. Ephesians.
3.12. Mat. 15.28. and 9.29. and 8.13.
Fullness of faith breeds fullness of peace and joy which passes
understanding. The firmer our faith, the more free is our access with
boldness and confidence to the throne of grace, the more fervently and
confidently can we pray Abba Father, the better success do we find in
prayer and the more quietly do we wait till the vision come, for it will
come and will not lie. Assurance of faith does enable with more ease to
overcome the world, to contemn the pleasures of sin, to possess the soul
in patience in hard and ^sore pressures, to curb unruly passions, to tread
Satan under feet, to break through all worldly difficulties and to run with
chereafulnes the race that is set before us. The weak belieuer creepes forward
in the way to Heaven, but it is with much difficulty; He has much ado with
himself, he is perplexed with fears, frightened with troubles, discouraged
with want of means; he is weary, feeble, pants, makes many a stand, and
slippeth now and then. It is far better with him, who is settled, stablished
and rooted in the knowledge and love of the truth, and is assured of Gods
mercy; has interest in all the promises of grace, and can lay actual claim
unto them. For he contemns the temptations of multitudes, customs,
examples; he dispiseth the offers of profits, pleasures, honors esteeming it
greater riches to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the
pleasures of sin. As for reproach, trouble, persecution he shrinkes not at
them, for his heart is fixed and trusts in the Lord. Heb. 12 2. Act. 20.24.
Psalm. 27.3. Act. 7.59.
In dangers he is confident, through means of deliverance appear not, because
he sees in God who is invisible, and rests upon his faithful promise, that
cannot deceive. His affections are seasoned, his heart is in Heaven, his love
to God is stronger then death, life it self is not dear unto him, that he may
finish his course with joy. If at any time he tread awry through ouer-sight or
infirmity, the stronger is his faith, the sooner does he arise again, renew
his repentance, and embrace the promises of mercy afresh. Let us then strive
to attain unto the best measure of faith, and to excel our selves. In earthly
things men are willing to better their condition: and shall we be careless in
heavenly things to provide well for our selves. In fair weather the Traveler
will carry his Cloak, because the season may change before his return: A
strong faith is ever of use, most needful in temptations of long continuance,
and grievous to be borne: and though now we live peace, we know not how soon
we may be called forth to trial, what service we may be put unto or the Lord
will exercise us.

. 10. But here we must remember, the strongest faith has infirmities. 10. The
strongest faith is subject to sundry infirmities. Job 3.3.8. Number. 20.10.11.12.
1. King. 19.4.
under which it groaneth and is subject to temptations both on the right hand
and on the left, even strong temptations whereby it is shaken for a time. Jobs
faith was shak^n, when he cursed the day of his birth; Moses his Faith quailed
at the rock: Eliah, that famous belieuer who had raised the dead, would be
dead in a passion Long delays did both try and shake the faith of Abraham.
Genesis 15.2.
In one and the same belieuer faith is sometimes greater and stronger, another
time more weak and infirm: Psalm. 3.5. with 31.22. 1. Sam. 27.1.
stronger in a great assault, weaker in a less. The gift of faith is without
repentance, and being once kindly planted in the heart, there it remains for
ever: but in regard of greatness or meanness it has many alterations
increasings and decreasings; yea, the strong belieuer does sometimes shrink
and draw back like a coward in small temptations, and the weak does quit
himself valiantly in great trials. The strong must not be careless, as if
he should never doubt again or be brought into straits: The strong belieuer
does sometimes shrink, when the weak stands fasts.
The weak must not be dismayed, as if they should utterly be overthrown:
Both weak and strong must look for trials, and be careful to preserve and
grow in faith. For the state of grace in this life is such as has still
relics of sin dwelling with it, and the Devil and the world still lay
siege against the castle of our faith to batter it, and prevail much when they
find us secure and careless, but are prevented by diligence and watchfulness
the Lord assisting.

CHAP. XI.
Of the right plantation of faith, and means whereby it is confirmed.

. 1. THE necessary use and excellent fruits of faith,. 1.
should incite men if they want to seek it with all diligence, and if they be
pertakers of that heavenly gift to hold and keep it, to increase and grow
therein. Motives and encouragements to believe. 2. Cor. 5 20.
And this the rather, because we have many encouragements to believe. God does
beseech men to be reconciled unto him: Should not this wonderful clemency of
God encourage us with boldness and confidence to come unto him? Christ
himself does graciously inuit all that be poor, Isay 55.1. Math. 11 28.
needy, weary and heavy laden to come unto him: and the Lord makes a
general proclamation of liberty to all distressed souls that will come and
receive it, without exception of any in particular: which should the rather
affect, if we consider who it is that proclaims, inuit h, beseeches,
namely, God, who is able to help, and ready to forgive and succor. If a
covetous man should offer us any great kindness, Deu. 7.9.
we might doubt of performance, because it is contrary to his nature but it
is not so with our God; his name is gracious, and his nature is to be faithful
in performance, and true in offer and promising. In the covenant that God of
his rich grace and mercy has made with his Church and people se^led with
Sacraments, and confirmed by oath, Ier 31.34. Heb. 10.16. Psalm. 32.10. Esaias.
55.7. Ezekiel. 18.21. and 33.11. Math. 3 17. Es^y 1.18. Tit. 2.14. 1. Ioh. 1 7.
remission of sins secret and open, great and small, of what quality soever,
is promised and assured to them that repent and believe. And when life and
salvation is promised to them that will receive it by faith, no man is excluded
from that mercy, but he that shuts forth himself by infidelity. We have a
Savior, who came into the world to save sinners, Mar. 16.16. Ioh. 3.15.16. and
6 34.40. Act. 10.43. Math. 1.21. and 18.11. Luke 19.10.
and is able to deliver us out of the hands of all our enemies, his redemption
being both precious and plentiful. And therefore though the multitude and
grieuousnesse of our sins should increase our repentance, yet they should not
diminish our faith, and diligence in seeking assurance of forgiveness. For
though our debt was never so great, our suertie Christ Jesus has paid it to
the utmost farthing. The Lord who is best acquainted with his own love, merc
e, and compassion, and knows what is pleasing and acceptable unto him, 1.
Ioh. 3.23.24.
has straightely charged and commanded us to believe in him, and believing
will bestow upon us eternal life according to promise. And can there be any
fraud in Gods word? or danger in yielding obedience to his Commandment? What
need we fear to commit our souls to him, 2. Tim. 1.12.
who is able to keep them, and has bound himself to save them, if we rely
upon him? Our Faith is directed to God in and through Jesus Christ our near
kinsman, who has taken our nature, and is become flesh of our flesh. Though
we feared some great man, yet were he married to our house, very near us,
this circumstance would animate us not a little: the same should we think of
our God, married as aforesaid to our flesh. Heb. 7.25.
Christ our Savior and high Priest ever lives, to appear in heaven before
his Father, and to make intercession for us. Math. 9.6.
The Father, who has committed all judgment to the Son, has given unto him
power to remit and pardon sin; 2. Cor. 5.19.
and he as our surety, having all our debt laid upon him, has by one oblation
of himself once offered, purchased for us eternal redemption; and by virtue
of his obedience has received for us, whatsoever he distributeth unto us. By
believing we glorify God both in his truth, power, wisdom, love, grace and
mercy, Romans 4.20.
whom before we dishonored by our sins. For the grace of God is manifested
by faith in Jesus Christ, Romans 3.24.28.
in the declaration and acknowledgment whereof stands the chief praise and
glory of the Lord, as the the last end of all his works. Mercy and compassion
in Man is but as the drop of a bucket in comparison of that huge Ocean of grace
that is to be found in our God. Math. 18.21.22
But God requires that we should forgive our Brother seventy times seven
times, if he did repent after he had trespassed against us: and will not our
God, who exacte^h such compassion in us, be much more ready to extend mercy
unto us, if we sue unto him. There is no difficulty so great either in
respect of sin or of the means etc, but it has been overcome by every one of
the Saints, which is our encouragement to seek faith, that we mig^t be healed.

. 2. Now the knowledge of God and Christ supposed without which there can be
no faith,. 2. Means for the right planting of faith.
the means for the right planting of faith be these.

Math. 9.12.13.
Hunger causes men to taste their meat: and mercy is pleasant to him that
knows his need of mercy.

Ho every one that thirsts come ye^ to the waters. Let every one that is a
thirst, Isay 55.1.2.^
come unto me, and drink. Ioh. 7.37. Numb. 21.9. Ioh. 3.14. Math 11.18.
If any be oppressed with the weight of sin, him does the Lord entreat and
persuade to come for ease: If any be confounded in conscience of his own
wretchedness and sin, to him the Lord calls in the Gospel, Come, and let
thy soul delight in fatnes. Men of this world labor to match with such in
marriage, as be rich and virtuous: but Christ does prefer love to such as be
poor, that he might make them rich; filthy, that he might make them
beautiful; in distress, that he might comfort them; base, that he might make
them honorable; guilty, that he might acquit them; naked, that he might
cloth them.

Thirdly, Ponder and weigh who it is that makes this liberal and free
promise, even God himself, who is able and willing, and faithful to perform
what he promises of his rich grace and unspeakable mercy. All these are
clear and manifest for the truth of them, b^t we have need often to set them
before us for our use, to encourage us the more boldly and sincerely to rely
upon Christ. To this end specially, are these testimonies of Gods Power,
Mercy, and Truth so often repeated in the Scriptures, that we might have them
ever before us, to uphold us against our doubtings and fears, whereof our
nature is full. The things promised in the Gospel are unlikely in reason,
opposite to sense and feeling, too great and excellent, as Satan and our
distrustful hearts will suggest, to be conferred upon such vile and filthy
creatures as we be, who have so many ways dishonored God, and have such a
load of sin lying still upon us; For the ouercomming of which temptation, we
must look up to him that has made the promise; his grace, faithfulness, and
power; and keep them in our eye continually, rowsin^ up our souls to believe
against sense and feeling, reason and likelihood, because God is faithful and
cannot deny himself; gracious, and will not cast us off for our
unworthiness; great in might, able to do whatsoever he will, and willing to
perform with his hand, whatsoever comes out of his mouth. We must say to
our souls, The Lord of his grace inuites thee a poor, needy, miserable,
selfe-condemned wretch to come unto Jesus Christ, and of the same grace has
promised to accept thee if thou do come, to heal thy soars, to forgive thy
sins; come therefore, behold, he calls thee: reason may be deluded, sense
is deceitful, but the Word of the Lord endures for ever: Thou have his
faithful promise for thy security, dispute no more, but draw near with
confidence.

Math. 13 44.
The wise Merchant does not buy the pearl, till he know it to be of excellent
price, or better then any price. Great things are eagerly sought upon probable
hopes: The mere possibility of obtaining some great and extraordinary good,
is of marvelous force in swaying men's actions. And if men consider serio^sly
what rare, surpassing, precious things be promised to them that come unto Jesus
Christ, and rest upon him, what shall withhold them from believing? Were we
certainly persuaded, that everlasting life, full laden with all the fruits of
true life, joy, peace, and all choicest pleasures, without any annoyance,
should be conferred upon them that believe in Jesus Christ, would we not hang
close, and stick fast, and not suffer the pleasures or profits of this
transitory life, to divide us from him. The reason why we strive so slackly to
believe, and be so dull in Gods service, and faint in trouble, is, because our
hearts be not holden with the serious consideration of that kingdom, joy and
glory, which God has prepared for them that believe, and cleave unto him.

Fifthly, It is also needful to deny our selves, our desires, lusts and
affections; to make over all our interest in our lives, or whatsoever is dear
unto us; inure our hearts calmely to the heat and opposition, though of
dearest friends, and the reproaches and reuilings of men though abject and
vile. This our Savior lays down as a fundamental principle, If any man will
come after me, Math. 16.24.
let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. Math. 10.37, 38
He that loves Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me: and he
that loves Son or Daught^r more then me, Luke 14.25.
is not worthy of me. And he that takes not his cross, and follows after
me, is not worthy of me. The necessity of this resolution he more fully
sets out unto us in two parables, of a builder that must be able to count his
cost and charges, and means to defray them, before he take that work in
hand; otherwise to begin to build, being unable to make an end, were to lay the
foundation of his disgrace, in the loss of his cost and pains: And a Prince,
who before he undertake war, must have sure trial of his own ability and
skill to discover his enemies strength, otherwise to bid him battle, were
rashly to provoke an enemy to his own loss and danger. Luke 14.33. Mat.
13.44, 45.
The conclusion of these inductions is this, So likewise, whosoever he be of
you, that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my Disciple. The
Merchant that would purchase the pearl of price, must sell all that he has to
buy it; He must sell his sins, which is properly all we have of our own)
and renounce his interest in the world, and whatsoever natural contentment he
might promise himself in the things of this world. The meaning is not, that
rich men must forgo their wealth, and betake themselves to voluntary
poverty; for riches well used be great instruments of doing good: But they
must cast the world out of their affections, and make over their interest in
whatsoever is most dear unto them: they must prefer the kingdom of Heaven
before the whole world, and therefore renounce both themselves, and all the
desires of the flesh, that nothing may hinder the enjoying of so rich a
treasure. Christ does make love unto us, and by many fair, sweet and precious
promises does allure and entice us to embrace him, but will be received by way
of Matrimonial covenant; we must forsake all base and carnal delights, cast
out of the heart whatsoever we formerly accounted precious in the world, cleave
unto him only, and be contented with those spiritual good things, which he
promises unto us. Christ has never due esteem with us, unless for his sake we
withdraw our hearts from all the riches, delights, honors and profits of the
world, and deny our selves, that in all things we might be conformable unto
his will and pleasure. What are we better then harlots, so long as the wo^ld or
the delights thereof, lusts or passions poss^sse the heart, and divide it from
Christ? Roots, though of trees, can go no deeper then the rock or stone: nor
can the Word of life si^ke deeper into the heart, then un o the roots of his
natural desires or affections: which vnrenounced, hinder the right taking and
kindly spreading of it. Luke 8.14.
The cares of this world and voluptuous living choke the seed of the word,
after it has taken some rooting, that it brings forth no fruit unto ripeness.
Therefore that the word of the kingdom may take kindly and fructify in us, we
must cast up our accounts before hand, what we can be content to forgo for
Christ's sake, and renounce the pleasures and delights of the World, giving up
our selves entirely to Jesus Christ, in all things to be directed and guided by
him, inuring our selves quietly to bear reproach, disgrace and contempt for
his sake, and watching heedfully in prosperity, that the world creep not into
our affection, and privily steal away our hearts from him. And this we shall do
the more freely, if we attentively consider what excellent and incomparable
treasures of delight, joy, and comfort are to be found in Jesus Christ, over
and above all the world can promise or afford. Should a good husband be offered
some goodly royalti^, upon condition he would forsake his base tenement or hard
rented lease, when once he perceived the profit of the exchange, you need not
use arguments to persuade him. Should some great Nobleman make suite of love
to a mean personage, upon condition she would forsake her base drudgerie for
the honors and delights of a palace, the motion would be accepted. And if
we seriously weigh that the Lord Jesus calls us to forsake the fleshpots of
Egypt, and alienat^ our interest in the world, and the flesh with all their
appurtenances, that we might be enriched with heavenly, euer-enduring
pleasures, in comparison whereof all earthly contentments are but dung and
dogs-meate; Phil. 3.8.
that he inuites us to cast away our harlotrie delights, that he might marry
us unto himself, and entitle us unto his everlasting kingdom, it will not be
grievous to make this exchange. But here it must be remembered, that it is not
the possession of earthly things, or delight in them, that is forbidden, but
that possession and delight in them, which withholds us from resigning our
selves unto Christ, and seeking after the promised land withal the heart and
all the soul. It is not the actual abandoning of riches, honor, or other
contentments of this life, which our Savior requires: but the dispossessing of
the heart of such base delights, that the whole heart may be set upon heavenly
things, and not with-drawne by secret reservation of special desires for other
purposes. And being thus disposed, we receive Christ with wel-rooted affiance,
and cleave to the mercy of God, as much better then life it self.

. 3. Faith kindly planted must be regarded seriously and carefully confirmed..
3. Faith once obtained is seriously to be regarded. Luke 22.31.
For Satan uses all means to weaken faith, yea, quite to subvert and
overthrow it. If an house begin to shrink or reele of one side, will we not
put under some shore to prop it up? Or if any man question the Title of Land we
have purchased, will we not search Records, and use means to strengthen it?
The malice of Satan in seeking by all means to batter down our faith, is
sufficient to show the excellency thereof, and to awaken us to a continual
careful regard to preserve and increase it. In this life we are subject to
many trials that require strength of faith to undergo them. Acts 14.22. 1.
These. 3.2, 3, 4.
The world, by reason of our continual employment in it, is apt to creep into
the heart, and insensibly to steal the affections from the eager pursuit of
heavenly things, which calls upon us for more then ordinary care to increase
our desires of grace, and moderate them in transitory things. He who will
have a plant to thrive in a ground dry, barren, and unkindly for it, must
strive much, because his soil will not do further, then it is forced: so he
that will make fire burn in green moist wood, must follow it with blowing:
thus to get faith to thrive in our natures, which are as apt to the weeds of
diffidence and vice, as auerse from faith and every true virtue, we must
strive with them, and offer violence unto them. He who does row against the
stream, must plie his oar, or he will go down apace: so it is here, we
go against the stream of corrupt nature, so far as we go in faith or
grace. Our daily and continual weakness of faith which we find in assenting
unto and receiving most objects of faith and promises of God, when it is
encountered with temptations: Our ordinary failings in the practice of holy
duties, and due ordering of our affections, which cannot be without a
precedent defect of that faith which only can firmly unite us unto Christ
does sufficiently manifest how feeble our belief is in the special mercies of
God toward us in Jesus Christ, which being the highest object is the hardest
to be apprehended, and can never be separated from firm assent unto every
precept of God, as much better then any incompatible good. And if men take food
and physic to strengthen their bodies, because they are frail: must we not
labor to confirm our weak and feeble faith? The labor bestowed about this
most gainful and beautifll grace, is so far from tedious toil, that it is
the solace of a Christian heart, and the pleasure thereof more sweet then any
pleasure that can be taken in all the pastimes of the World. For by that
means we grow more and more familiarly and better acquainted with the mind
and purpose of God toward us, we enjoy sweet communion and fellowship with
him, we are made ready for our latter end at one time as well as another, and
are armed to go well and chearefully through with the affairs of the day,
believing that God will guide and bless us. And of this also we may be well
assured, that according to our strength of faith the lively fruits of holy
obed^ence shall be found in us, and as our faith grows, so does sound peace,
joy, and safety; strength against corruption, ability to resist temptations,
poverty, of spirit, meekness, purity, hunger and thirst after
righteousness, mercifulness, and pleasure in the means whereby faith is
preserved and confirmed, increased, and that from time to time, more and more.
But as for such as will not settle themselves to nourish their faith with care
and diligence, they deprive themselves of much inward peace, which they might
enjoy, and make their lives uncomfortable to themselves, unprofitable to
others: They lay themselves open to many offenses, which by this exercise they
might preu^^; and they go on, either in unsavory lightness and carn^ll joy,
which does deceive them, or else in unprofitable care and worldly sorrow, which
will disquiet them. And when they neglect the fashioning of Christ in their
hearts, and so truly to put him on in their daily conversation, they become
unprofitable in their lives, offensive in their carriage; and the Devil
weakeneth and holds back sundry (which were coming on) by their example,
thinking themselves well in the case they are in, rather then they should be in
following them, unless they saw some beauty and excellency in their lives,
more then in themselves.

. 4. The means whereby faith is confirmed and strengthened are these,. 4.
Means whereby faith is strengthened and confirmed.
and such like:

otherwise, every small occasion will hinder us, every fond delight carry us
away, and every trifle take up the heart, much more our earnest and weighty
affairs and business, to which most men think, that all exercises of
religion ought to give place. Things of worth are disesteemed if their value be
not known: and trifles are looked after when they be ouer-valued. A true
esteem of the price, excellency and use of faith, the profit and comfort of
it, will raise an earnest continual care to preserve and keep it.

Luke 10.42.
One thing is necessary; otherwise Satan who can change himse f into an
Angel of Light, will fill our hearts and heads with swarms of evil lusts,
noisome delights, cares and distractions: which will draw our Minds from that
which they ought most to mind and think upon. We must be heedfull in this,
not only that the world draw us not to increase our wealth by wicked or unjust
means, but that it creep not insensibly into our affections, and so by
degrees not observed, breed great distempers in the soul. Fear of want, joy
and delight in what we justly and honestly possess, climbing into the heart,
and by little and little getting head, do suck away that virtue, whereby the
word sown should receive strength and increase, and alienate part of the soul
from God. Herein therefore we must be circumspect, gaging our hearts and trying
them to the bottom, weaning our selves from these delights, raising our souls
to more spiritual and heavenly joys, and laboring that our desire of grace
and care to exercise our selves in all good works do grow, as the world comes
in upon us.

humbleness of mind, meekness, purity, mercy, long-suffering, and in all
good works, improuing what we have received to the glory of God, is a notable
means to confirm and strengthen faith. Faith brings forth good works, and
good works increase faith. Faith has his fruit created in it: but the better
fruit it brings forth, the faster it grows. Faith is a fruitful Mother
that gives life to holiness: and good works, as a kind Daughter, help to
support and sustain the Mother. Be ye steadfast, 1. Cor. 15.58.
immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.



Exodus 34.6. John 7.37. Hos. 14.2, 3. 1. John 5.14. Prou 28.13. Ephesians. 2.4.
remembering withal what manifold, sweet and gracious promises he has made
unto us in the Gospel of his Son, whereby we come to have more near
acquaintance with Gods nature, his mind, and purpose toward us. And if we
believe an honest man so much the more, because he often goes over i^, when
he affirms this or that unto us: the serious meditation of Gods promises
reiterated again and again, must be available to strengthen faith, Romans
10.17.
and fashion the Image of God in us more and more.

an holy use of the Sacraments, Romans 4.11.
whereby this heavenly truth, which we have already received, is yet further
sealed up to our consciences. These ordinances we must frequent with an
appetite. Sound and healthful bodies receive nourishment from their food, and
suck vigor out of it for growth and strength: Lively faith feeds on the Word
of life, and increases. Though the Word be immortal seed, which corruptible
food is not, yet in this they are like, that look as bodily food does not put
to the body, all that substantial strength and latitude which belongs to it;
so the food of the Word does not at one time augment the soul, with all length
and depth of Knowledge, Faith, Hope, Love, Justice, Temperance, which it is to
be brought unto. In which regard, as living bodies need daily food that they
might grow unto perfection of nature, so souls having grace, have need to go
over with the use of the means, as well as others, that the divine nature may
be more and more enlarged, getting up as the light of the Sun^e does in the
air which it inlightneth.

remembering that former comforts are as a bill obligatorie under Gods hand to
assure that he will not forsake us. For whom God loves, he loves to the
end; John 13.1.
because he is unchangeable, the same for ever, which consideration may serve
to settle us in assurance of Gods love toward us, more then a child can be
of his Fathers good will, or a wife of her bodily Husbands favor, for they are
mutable.

sorrow for sin, sometimes he refreshes them with more lively apprehension
of the joys of Heaven, sometimes they feel the motions of the Spirit quick
and lively upon what occasions soever, or in what manner it shall please God to
offer himself unto us, it stands us upon to make use of that for our
quickening, to nourish the motions of his Spirit, and by fervent Prayer to
entreat the continuance of his presence.

Ninthly, Faith increases by exercise, and grows by continual use. If we
learn to live by faith in matters of this life, both when we have, and when
we want the means, and rest upon God for success in our lawful calings
without distracting care, we shall with more facility and ease depend upon the
free promises of grace for mercy and forgiveness.

CHAP. XII.
Of the temptations whereby Satan seeks to batter down our faith, and how he
may be resisted.

. 1. Ephesians. 6.16. 1. Pet. 5.8.
. 1. THe Devil knows right well, that faith is the band whereby we are knit
unto Christ; the shield whereby we quench the fiery darts of the Devil, the
groundwork of a godly life, and the safe castle of a Christian soul: If
faith be weakened, our zeal cools, our courage abateth, our life is
tedious, our Prayers faint, the exercises of Religion uncomfortable, and all
the graces of Gods Spirit pine and languish. Also by doubting and distrust we
dishonor God, lay open our hearts to temptations, discourage others and tie
our own hands that we cannot fight against our deadly enemies. For these
causes Satan endeavors by all means to hinder, as the kindly taking so the
growth of faith, that such as he cannot hold in the chains of sin, he might
make their lives dead, Temptations against Faith.
wearisome, unprofitable by doubting and discomfort.

First, Satan suggesteth, 1. Worthlesnesse.
that it is horrible presumption for such vile sinners and worthless wretches
to persuade themselves of Gods special love and favor. And to this end he
spares not to set forth the majesty, justice, and purity of the Lord, that
it might strike the greater terror into the wounded conscience.

For the repelling of this temptation, Remedy. The sense of our unworthiness
must not discourage us from believing.
it is to be known and remembered that Gods mercy, favor, promises, and
benefits are all free, which he vouchsafes, offers, bestows, without any
respect of worthiness or deserts, of his mere grace and undeserved love in
Jesus Christ. And therefore as when we are most worthy in our own conceit,
there is no reason we should presume the more; so when we find our selves
unworthy, there is no cause why we should hope the less. For the ground of
our confidence is the promise of free and undeserved mercy made in Christ
Jesus to miserable forlorn sinners, who see and acknowledge themselves to be
more vile then the mire in the street. And this sets forth the praise of Gods
mercy so much the more, that it is afforded to such base abiects, who deserve
nothing: but to be cast forth and trodden underfoot. Should the prisoner doubt
of his Princes mercy when he hears his pardon read, and sees it sealed,
because he has merited no such kindness? Again, it is good to call to mind
and seriously to consider what strong encouragements we have to receive the
promises; and how we are not more desirous to believe, then God is we should
so do. For God does through love entreat us, of friendship counsel us, 2.
Cor. 5.19, 20. 1. Tim. 1.15. 1. John 3 23, 24.
and of his authority being able to perform commands us; as if he would
hereby show that none has authority to hinder or forbid the same. And
therefore we must be warned, to beware of all occasions that may darken or put
out the light of our confidence; as reasoning or questioning against our selves
for yielding to this truth lately received etc.

. 2. Satan will here object to the weak and timorous Christian, that he
knows not whether he be of the number of Gods elect,. 2. 2. They know not
whether they be elected
and therefore has nothing to do with the promises. If the Devil set upon us
in this sort, we must hold such suggestions to arise from the Spirit of
error, Remedy. 1. Ioh. 3.23. 1. Tim 6.12. Heb. 10.35. Math. 13.31. Joel 2.6.7.
Ioh 10.27. Satan is not to be hearkened unto, nor reasoned with, when he
tempts to Infidelity. Genesis 3.1.2.3.
because they are contrary to the voice of God, who says to the afflicted
conscience that is weary of sin, Believe, lay hold on eternal life, cast not
a way thy confidence; Be established, confirmed, and abound in faith. Therefore
we must lend no ear to such whisperings of the old serpent, but cleave fast to
the word of the Lord, and cut off all contrary enchantments. It was the first
degree to the utter undoing of her self and posterity in our Grandmother Eve,
that she opened her ear to a false and lying spirit in the mouth of a
Serpent, which under a fair color persuaded, or rather covertly enticed and
drew her to eat of the forbidden fruit. The decree of God which is secret in
the bosom of the most High is not the rule according to which we must walk:
but the word of life revealed in holy Scriptures we must take for our
direction. Ephesians. 1.13.
If God make offer of mercy and forgiveness unto us in the ministry of the
Gospel, which is the word of truth, the word of salvation, we are bound to
receive it without looking into the book of his election: and if we receive
them truly, we shall be saved as the Lord has spoken.

. 3. If Satan be driven from this hold, he sollicites to fear, because many
doubts and motions of distrust arise in the heart;. 3. 3. They are full of
doubtings. Psalm. 2^.1.2. and 77.10.11.
as if there could be no faith where there are so many doubts. And it cannot
be denied, but motions to distrust argue faith to be weak, which is a want
that many of Gods people do bewail in themselves, and for which they do
well-nigh despair in themselves. Remedy. Faith may be true that is weak.
Ioh. 4 39 41.52. Math. 20.20.18 Luke 9.45. Mar. 9.32. Luk 24.11. John 13.38.
and 14.5. Act. 1.6.
Notwithstanding let not any be out of heart, for the small and scantie
measure of his faith, if he huae true faith, wel-rooted. For faith may be true
and lively, that is but weak and small. For difference in degrees does not
vary the nature of wel-rooted affiance. And God requires the truth of faith,
but it is not necessary, that it be perfect in degree. If a Prince should
proferre a pardon to a malefactor upon this condition only that he receive
it, would he question his Sovereigns bounty and grace, because he put forth
a palsey-shaking hand? To doubt of Gods mercy because our faith is feeble, is
rather to rely upon our faith then upon the Lord. It is not the excellency
and great measure of faith that does make us righteous before God, but Christ
whom faith does receive and apprehend: which a weak faith can do as well as
the strongest. They that did look on the brazen serpent but with one eye, yea
but with half an eye were as well and fully cured of the deadly stings of the
fiery serpents, as those which beheld it with both. As a small and weak hand
is able to receive an alms as well as a stronger and greater: so our faith
though feeble, does receive Christ as truly and effectually for the salvation
of the belieuer, as the greatest and most strong. In the manner of receiving
there is some difference [for the more firm our confidence, the g^eater is our
comfort] but in the truth none at all. Again it is not faith, but Christ
received by faith that nourishes to life eternal. Meat reached to the mouth
by a trembling hand sustaineth the body no less, then if it were applied by an
arm of strength; the goodness of the nourishment receiving no change or
alteration from the external instrument of application: so here Christ is the
same to them that receive him truly, though it be done in one with more, in
another with less strength of affiance. We read in Scripture, that Christ
reproved some for their small faith, that they might stir up themselves more
confidently to rely upon him: but we have not heard, Math. 12.20. Esaias 42.3.
Mark. 9.24.
that he ever rejected any that came to him in weakness, desi ing to be
confirmed. The least grain^ of faith, if true, is acceptable unto the Lord: He
will not quench the smoking flax. His dislike of our weakness is an argument
of his love and care for our good, who would have us to be settled in the
assurance of his favor, and not to waver in uncertainties to our great
discomfort. The strait charge he has laid upon us to believe, and the severe
threatenings annexed to that his Commandment if we obey it not, is a manifest
evidence of his bounty and will good toward us, who is pleased thus to bind
us unto himself, to confirm unto us his love, and so undoubtedly to assure us
of his mercy, that it is to him a matter of unkindness, if we shall once make
doubt or scruple of it. Does any man mistrust the affection of his friend,
because he has often charged him not to be strange, to make bold with him in
any matter of importance and need, and has rebuked him because he stands
aloof as though he should not be welcome.

. 4. Some are dismayed, for that they cannot keep their faith (for any
continuance) strong and steadfast,. 4. 4. They cannot keep their faith strong
and steadfast.
but they feel it wavering, inconstant, flitting, so that they fall into great
sorrow, fear and doubtings. For their comfort they must know that there is no
shadow of change with God, Remedy. James 1.17. Psalm. 77.10.11. Romans 11.29.
and that it is their weakness so to think. Men are variable in their
affections, whom they dote upon this day, they detest to morrow: But such
lightness and vanity is far from our God: His love, mercy, and gifts of
grace are all unchangeable. Also they must be persuaded, that laboring after
and groaning to rest their wearied souls upon the promises of mercy, being
never satisfied till their doubtfullnesse be removed will bring a good end;
Want of feeling argues not want of faith.
so that they shall neither miscarrie, nor be fo saken of the Lord in the
lowest depth of their distress. And though for a time they feel not that they
have faith or life, they may truly be alive unto God, as it is evident by
sun^rie testimon^es and properties of the new birth, which may be di^cerned in
them who do most complain of their estates. A man suddenly stricken to the
ground and amazed with some violent blow, wants not life altogether, though
he perceive it not: Breathing and moving are infallible tokens of life in the
body, which by many likelihoods appears to be de^d: so painting and
breathing after the consolations of the Lord, and the l ght of his countenance,
be undoubted signs of the new birth, though they be not easily discerned
(especially in the hour of temptation) by them in whom they are. Wherefore the
weak in faith must be wise in heart, and not measure themselves by their
present faintings and infirmities: but wait upon God, and use the means which
he has prescribed in his word. As child en first learn to go by a stool or
form; sick folk recover their taste or strength by little and little; plants
shoot not up suddenly and at once, but by degrees, corn suffers many a sharp
storm before it come to r^penes: so faith has it beginning, growth, and
confirmation; calmes and storms to ripen it. If it be demanded, why does God
deal thus with his children, and suffer them to fall into such depth of
doubting, sorrow and fear. The answer is, that in regard of the belieuer
himself this doubting is a weakness, Why the faithful are subject to such
doubts and want of feeling.
which must be with-stood and overcome: For the attaining whereto, the occasion
of this doubting in him who has once believed must be searched out, and so
removed: which ordinarily is our own infirmity, neglect of duty, and
sleightnes in the manner of performing the same, or some particular sin, fo
pronesse to sin and nourishing the same, or long lying therein; whereupon the
tender conscience fears that his former comfort was but deceitful and vain,
and so doubts of his good estate. But this falls out by the wise providence
of God so disposing, least by the sudden change from so damnable and
uncomfortable an estate to so happy and joyful, he should be lifted up and
conceited, and so become secure and presumptuous. Again this makes him the
more to p^ize the sense of Gods mercy, and with the greater care to preserve
his faith, and to shun all sin and wickedness, which might hinder the
apprehension of his continual love.

and examination whose duty it is carefully to reform whatsoever they epsy
to have been amiss: but for one rotten post it is no wisdom to pull down
the whole building. Remedy. 1. Ioh. 1.9.
For God is merciful, and ready to forgive our imperfections, when upon the
knowledge and sight we confess and bewail them. Faith may be true, though
much were amiss, when first we received, the truth.
The Disciples at first followed Christ in hope of temporal preferment, and
yet their faith was sound and true; for when they came to the knowledge of
their error, they reformed it, and did still inseperably cleave unto him. It
is the great wisdom and mercy of the Lord, for a time to hide from his
children the sight of their infirmities and wants, and nowithstanding their
manifold weaknesses to afford unto them the sense of his love, least they
should be utterly discouraged and faint under the burden for want of
experience, finding the entrance into life hard and difficult. Natural
discretion teaches us to deal with children according to their ability, and
not to dishearten them by exacting what is above their strength: The like
compassion does the Lord show to his, by the comforts of his Spirit preparing
them to endure the assaults of Satan.

. 6. Many Christians be exercised with this temptation, that they cannot be
the children of God, because they never had that deep sorrow. 6. 6. They never
had that deep sorrow, which many have felt.
and long lying under it that many of their Brethren have had. Remedy. God
deals not with all alike.
Whereas they should know, that not men's examples but Gods word must be our
rule of direction. The Lord deals not with all alike, because in wisdom he
knows what is most meet for every man. Does any man complain because his
joints are set, or his wounds cured with little smart and pain? The Physician
knows best the strength of his patient, and what he can bear: what is
necessary for one, would kill another. It is good to grieve, Faith may be
sound in the^, who never found such depth of sorrow, as others have done.
because we can grieve no more for sin: But to doubt of Gods love, because he
deals gently with us, least we should be swallowed up of sorrow, is great
ignorance, weakness and folly. God many times keeps from his servants the
horrible and ghastly aspect of their sins in wonderful mercy, least the
horror of them and Gods wrath due for them, should ouer-whelme them. Hos.
2.14. Acts 16.14, 15.
If God by inticements and speaking to thy heart have brought thee home unto
him, thou have cause to magnify the tender mercy of the Lord, who has not
dealt with thee after thine iniquities: for had he set thee upon the rack, as
many have been, thou have reason to think, thou had never been able to
bear it. Fear of conscience, grief of mind, doubtfulnesse of salvation
commends no man to God; neither is it against a man or with him in assuring
himself of salvation, whether he have long or short time been pressed with
such sorrows, but that he be well freed and delivered from such trouble, and
discharged of his fear.

because there is much weakness of spiritual life in him, he never felt any
great strength of grace in himself,. 7. 7. They never felt any great strength

and what he formerly felt is now decayed. Remedy.
By this Temptation God does chasten our pride and swelling of heart,
unthankfulness, discontinuance of care to cherish and increase received
graces by means sanctified, running into occasions of decay and cooling, and
contentment with a small pittance of grace, faith, hol^nesse: For all which
sins and other of like kind, we must unfeignedly humble our selves before God,
craving pardon of his mere grace and mercy. This Humiliation is a special
means to ease the conscience; as the wound does cease raging when it is opened
and well drawn. We may have true faith, though we never had any great
strength of grace.
And it must be remembered, that we are but children, and therefore weak;
yea, and subject to many spiritual diseases such as take away sense of life:
and therefore we must seek to be cured, and not despair of life. When any one
part or member is distempered or ill at ease, we despair not of the safety of
the whole person, but labor to cure and restore it to health again: so when
we have offended, we should resort to the Physician Christ Jesus, make our
complaint to him, and be confident for his promise sake that he will help
us. And if they who have fallen and offended God, Ier. 3.1.
may turn home again to their first Husband with good welcome, shall not they
much more be beloved of him, and comforted by him, who have not provoked him,
but are only held down through fear and infirmity. And though their graces
be small, they may be true whiles they be small. Little faith is faith, as a
little fire is fire. God despises not little things in obedience offered to
him. In the sacrifices of the Law, not the price of the gift, but the ability
and affection of the offerer was respected. Luke 21.2, 3, 4.
And if weakness of grace was any just cause of fear, who might assure
himself of Gods love? Not one. For though some have grace in greater measure
then others, yet all are compassed with infirmities, and have not attained unto
perfection. But it is not so much enquired how great or little, as how sincere
our faith and obedience is. Faith if it be unfeigned, though but as a grain of
Mustard seed; obedience, if it be hearty, though mingled with many
infirmities has promise of gracious acceptance. And the smallest beginnings
are pledges of greater favors, where there is thankful acceptance and
conscionable use of those already received to the glory of the bestower.

of graces in part, and for a time. Remedy. Phil. 4.10. Math. 16.18. In Gods
dearest children there may be decay of graces.
Of the Philippians the Apostle says, your care begins to spring again:
belike they had their winter whom a new spring revived. It is true the Lord
has promised, that Hell gates shall never prevail utterly to overthrow the
faith of his chosen, or any other grace radically accompanying salvation: but
to preserve continual sensible exercise of any grace, he has no where
promised. The graces of God do ebb and slow in his servants (and that by the
wise disposition of God) lest if we had attained facility in all things, we
should think that our own, which is merely his work. Who amongst the
faithful does always hear with equal attention, reverence, cheerfulness,
etc. or pray with like earnestness of desire, feeling of wants, assurance to
be heard, or submission to Gods will? or do any thing at all times, so as at
some. The Lord many times withdrawes the use of some particular grace, that
some other may in greater measure show forth it self in us. Joy and rejoicing
in his mercy he withholds, that he might bring to the practice of humiliation.

or that presumptuous license we took to our selves in sinning, or in
questioning with our selves of his graces: All which things we are heartily to
confess and bewail. But for the comfort of the distressed, he is to know,
that sometimes graces may lie hid, yea, and work in respect of our
acknowledgment insensibly. We may not conclude, there is no truth of grace in
us, because we cannot perceive and feel it.
The seed of faith cannot be lost, after it is once planted in an honest and
good heart by the holy Spirit: but the sight thereof may be hid from our
knowledge, and the lively functions thereof intermitted. The child lives in the
mothers womb, though it know not so much. Life remains in a man fallen into a
dead swound, wherein he is deprived for a time of understanding, reason,
memory, sense, motion, and all apparent vital functions. The tree lives in
winter, though nipped with frosts, and weather-beaten with tempests, dead in
appearance. Coals raked close under the ashes, that they give neither heat nor
light, do yet retain both, though they show not forth themselves. There is a
generation pure in their own eyes, who are not purged from their iniquities:
Prou. 30.12
the most holy are not privy to all their secret sins, nor thoroughly
acquainted with the deceitfulness of their own hearts: And the graces of the
Spirit may lie hid in the hearts of the regenerate, Psalm. 19.12.
and work insensibly to their feeling and discerning, as well as corruption
lurk secretly and work privily in the soul both of regenerate and
unregenerate. An argument drawn from his sense and feeling: may have some
color in the conceit of a distressed mind: but in truth it is a deceitful
reasoning to conclude, That they have no faith, because they have no sense or
feeling thereof in their apprehension. In the agony of conscience none are
more unfit to judge of our estate, then we of our own. Though at other times
we be sick of self-love, and too partial in our own case; yet in this
state, toward our selves we are most uncharitable; and being out of love with
our selves, we are apt to derogate from the work of Gods Spirit in us. In
time of temptation the godly do err many ways in examination of themselves.
It is most certain also, that in the examination and trial of our estates we
commit no small errors in the time of temptation, the mind being clouded with
the mists of Satan's suggestions, and the heart so distempered with fear, that
we cannot discern the graces of God in us, nor acknowledge boldly what in a
sort we see. Suggestions we take to be sins of consent and purpose; failing
in the purposed measure of serving God or in some particular, we distinguish
not from falling from our general purpose to cleave unto God in the
performance of all duties of holiness and righteousness: we put not
difference betwixt absolute falling from purpose, and failing in execution of
purpose in some particular. Common infirmities we judge presumptuous sins,
or such blemishes as cannot be in the Saints of God: passions we esteem as
deliberate purposed resolutions: and motions to distrust, which are evidences
of weakness, are supposed pregnant tokens of total infidelity. Certainty of
adherence is not distinguished from certainty of evidence: if we find not
assurance of pardon, we conclude there is no faith, though possibly at the
present, we resolve to roll our selves upon the faithful promise of God, and
power out our souls for mercy. The Lord diversely gives evidence of his
Spirits presence in us. Sometimes a child of God perceiues little difference
in practice betwixt himself and very aliens; yet let him view his affections,
he may see grace there; sometimes again more may be seen in practice, then in
the affection. When the heart is ouer-whelmed with fear and doubt, a man
cannot find love, joy, or delight in the Word of God; but then his frequenting
the house of God, his private reading and conference, are testimonies that his
will is bent to the Law of God. But these things are not observed in the times
of distress and bitter anguish, whence it follows, that God may evidence his
presence with us by the Spirit of grace, when by reason of our frailty we
cannot discern it.

Furthermore, if a man can discern no spark of grace, If a man can discern
no spark of grace in himself for the present, he is not to despair.
nor feel any good thing in himself, he is not to despair. But as the sense
and feeling of his present state ought to humble him under Gods hand, and move
him to enter into a serious examination of himself, and to unfeigned repentance
for his sins: so must he take comfort unto himself, and prop up his weak
declining faith, by calling to mind former times, Psalm. 77.3, 9, 10, 11.
and wherein the Lord has caused his merciful and gracious countenance to
shine upon him, and wherein he has glorified God by an holy life and
conversation. For if ever he has discerned the graces of Gods Spirit by the
fruits of sanctification, they are not utterly taken away, though for a time
they be buried from his sight, that he cannot find them. The seed is not dead
that lies all winter under the clods, and appears not by fruit above ground.
If he be not able to gather comfort from former experience, but be ready to
question that also, yet must he not give way to uncomfortable and deading
sorrow: because the thirsty soul, who neither feels inward sap, Esaias 55.1,
2. Math. 11.28.
nor finds outward fruit of grace, is called to come unto Christ the
fountain of living waters, that in him and by him he might be eased,
refreshed, made fruitful. This gracious inuitation the poor soul must lay
hold upon, and say within himself, I will draw near unto the God of my
salvation and trust in him, for I have his firm and stable promise, that I
shall be watered with grace and refreshed with comfort. If I be hungry, he
has plenty of provision; if barren, dry, and withered, with him there is
abundance of grace, that I may be enriched.

. 10. The Devil, who goes about like a roaring Lion seeking whom he may
devour, will not spare to suggest, to the contrite and humbled soul, that God
cannot or will not forgive his transgressions, which have been most heinous

number, and heinous for quality.
and in which he has long lived and continued. And it may be the Lord would
hereby correct our former conceits in the days of our vanity, Remedy.
that of all things pardon of sins is most easily obtained, that it was but a
slight and small thing to sin against God, that we might well enough take
our fill of sin for the time, and turn to the Lo d in old age and sickness.
But withal this thought must be held to arise from Satan, and shunned as
repugnant to the truth of God. The heinousness or number of our sins make us
not incapable of mercy.


For the promise of pardon is made to repentant sinners without limitation to
any time, person, quality or number of offenses. And for the remedy and
remouall of this temptation, first, we should humble our selves before God for
our light esteem of sin, and procrastination or delays: 2. Cor. 1.3. Esaias
55.7. James 5.7. Ier. 3.1, 2.3.13, 14. 11. They feel the heavy burden of Gods
wrath.
And then consider the endlesnes of Gods mercies in Christ, the price which was
paid for our redemption, the sweet promises propounded in the Word, the
stablenesse and perpetuity of the Covenant, and the examples of great sinners
received to mercy. And what if a man sensibly feel the heavy burden of Gods
wrath, and plainly discern his frowning and angry countenance? Though sense
of Gods love fail, faith may continue strong. Remedy. Job 13.15. Heb. 11.1.
Faith may be strong, when we have no sense or feeling of mercy.
For faith is not grounded upon sense and feeling: but upon Gods gracious
promises, immutable goodness, and infallible truth. Yea, when sense and
feeling cease, then faith which is the evidence of things not seen, begins
it chief work: and the most excellent faith shows it self most clearly
when we have no sense or feeling, or when we feel the plain contrary. Faith
looks to the promise, mercy, power and truth of God, and to the manner of
his working: and seeing his mercy is incomprehensible, his power infinite, his
manner of working by contraries, his truth firm and immovable, therefore in
the greatest terrors it belieueth peace, when God shows himself an enemy,
it apprehends him loving and merciful, and out of the deepest humiliation,
above sense or reason, gathers the sweetest consolation. If ever we have
tasted of Gods love and mercy, lively faith concludes that we are still in
his love and favor, James 1.17. John 13 1, 2.
whatsoever we apprehend in our present sense and feeling: for whom he loves,
to the end he loves them. Yea, faith goes before experience or sense of
mercy, and waits for salvation in Christ, in the depth of misery, grounding
it self merely upon the Word of truth which cannot lie. We believe to taste
the goodness of the Lord, not because we have felt already, how kind the Lord
is; though we may make use of feelings past to sustain us in present agonies.

Experience and sense is a stay or prop for our better ease, not the ground
upon which our faith leans; and though it be shaken faith continues firm.
If therefore at any time our sense and feeling tell us one thing (namely that
God has cast us off forever, and will never look graciously upon us) and the
Word of God assure us of another (to wit, that God does love us, and will never
forsake us utterly) we are not to give credit to our own feeling, but to Gods
Word. For our sense is often deceiving, specially in matters of godliness: but
the Word of the Lord is sincere and abides for ever. In bodily diseases of
some kind, we trust more to the judgment of a skillful Physicion, then to
our own conceits: and shall we not think, that God knows our spiritual
estate better then we our selves? What can we believe in matters of religion,
if we believe not more then we can discern by sense or reason? The being of a
thing, and the sensible discerning of the thing to be are diverse. Howsoever at
sometimes they concur, yet oftentimes they are severed and disioyned. Because
the Sun appears not to us at Midnight, shall we conclude, that it never
has, or will shine to us again. Shall a child imagine his Father never did
or will truly love him hereafter, because for the present he does not admit
him into his presence, or afford him a favorable and lovely countenance? No
less absurd, but more injurious is it to our heavenly Father, to conjecture,
that no grace or favor is to be sound with God, seeing now the beams of his
love and mercy are hidden from us. The dearest servants of God, who have been
endued with most eminent graces, and highly advanced into special favor with
him, have yet in their own sense apprehended wrath and indignation^, Psalm.
22.1, 2. and 38.3, 4. and 77.7. and 88.14. Ier. 20.14, 15.
instead of love and favor, displeasure instead of comfort, and trouble
instead of peace. Did God tenderly respect them, when he seemed to tear them
in pieces, and to break their bones like a roaring Lion: and shall we judge
of his affection by our present feeling.

. 11. But what if we have long used the means of grace, and can find no
comfort? In this case,. 11. 12. They have long used the means of grace, and
can find no comfort. Cant. 5.2.3.
we must repent of the former neglect to accept of grace offered, and pray to
God to forgive and pardon it. We must also examine our hearts with all care
and diligence to find out the sins which happily do hinder comfort, and
bewailing the same, stir up our selves to receive the promises. Remedy.
For often times the entertaining of some bosom sin, which we are loath to
part withal, is that which m kes the breach in our conscience. And sometimes
we walk without comfort, not so much because God withholds it, as that we put
it from us; The godly sometimes walk without comfort, because they put it from

selves to strive against fears, or shutting our eyes against the evidences of

Spirit is, whereby God witnesses to us that we are his children. For whiles
we take it to be some vocal testimony, which certifyeth us against fears
and doubts, even in the midst of temptations, and in a manner whether we
will or no; we fall into no small perplexities, Oftentimes God causes his
Children to seek long before they find comfort. 2 Cor. 12.8.
not finding any such certificate in our selves, whereas the witness of the
Spirit is clean of another nature. This is no new thing, that God should cause
his children to seek long before they find comfort. The Apostle in like
extremity besought the Lord thrice, that is often, before he received answer.
And though God delay, either to chasten neglects, or to kindle affection, or
that graces hardly obtained may be valued according to their worth, yet will he
not always despise his children that cry unto him day and night. The ardent
desire shall at length be satisfied, the panting soul be refreshed with the
waters of consolation Comfort and joy is the reward of our obedience: but
patient waiting is a pleasing and acceptable service to God. It is Gods work
to give comfort, it is our duty to wait for it in the ways of holiness. Let
us be contented to serve God freely without wages, and in the end, we shall be
no loosers. Remission of sins and peace of conscience are favors worth
waiting for. If the Lord should keep us on the rack even till the last gasp,
and then impart unto us the least drop of his mercy or sense of his love in
Jesus Christ, his grace were unspeakable toward our souls: and let us not
then think much to wait in patience a little while. We have not waited so
many years in the means of grace for comfort, as God has waited for our
conversion. If we have made him to stand knocking at the door of our hearts
long before we gave him entrance, let it not seem tedious, if the Lord do
not forthwith open to us the door of his privy chamber, and admit us to the
sweet fellowship and communion with him. Comforts when they come are usually
proportioned to the measure of tribulation, and multitude of fervent prayers
powered out before the Lord. Much trouble receives in the end plentiful
consolation.

. 12. Satan molesteth some Christians with fear of of falling into some
fearful extremity:. 12. 13. They are afraid of falling into some fearful
extremity. How this temptation is to be resisted. Luke 22.32. Romans 8.24.35.
Phil. 1.6. Romans 11.29. Psalm. 37.24.
By which temptation it pleases God to acquaint men with their own weakness,
and to chasten or prevent pride, security, rash censuring of others that have
fallen into such discomforts, or the like. But for the remedy thereof let them
labor to fortify faith in the gracious promises which God has made to his
children of sustentation and perseruation. As faith increases, so fear
abateth; as it ebs so fear flows. And let them to this end consider, that
Christ has prayed for preservation against all seperating extremes. And God
that cannot lie, has promised to keep his children from utter declining, and
to establish them that be feeble and ready to fall. The Lord has made it
known to be his will and pleasure, that he will never take away that grace
which once he has given, but increase it rather till it be perfected and
accomplished: and when we are assured of his will, we may rely upon his power
for the effecting of it, and infer he will keep us safely, because he is
able to estabish and confirm us. The greater our weakness is in grace, and
the more grievous our sickness through sin, and the noisome humors of
corruption, the more carefully will he watch over us with his Almighty power.
The strong cannot stand by their own might if God withdraw his hand: and the
weakest shall be able to overcome their mightiest enemies being underpropped
by the Lord. What floods of trouble soever do flow over us, we shall escape
drowning, if the Lord hold up our chinne. Fear is a deceitful and malicious
passion, tyrannical, rash and inconsiderate, proceeding oftentimes from want
of judgment, more then from the presence or approach of evil to be feared,
tormenting with the dread of what shall never come, we were never in danger of:
It is therefore valiantly to be resisted, not to be believed or reasoned
withal. Fear in our own strength is by all means to be cherished: but
diffidence in Gods power, mercy, goodness, truth and providence is to be
abandoned. The strong must not presume in himself, though more excellent then
others in grace, nor the weak distrust in the Lord, though feeble, and not
able to go high-lone. The hope of preservation staying upon inherent grace is
self confidence: and the fear of falling arising from the sense of weakness
is diffidence in God. In holy Scripture we shall find, that the strongest have
fallen, when the weak have stood and they have been foiled most grievously,
not in the greatest assaults, but when they have given way to their lusts,
neglected their watch, or were grown secure and dreaded no danger. The Lord
best knows the strength of his child, and will not suffer him to be
overtaken with those uncomfortable falls out of which he shall not recover.

. 13. Sundry Christians through the malice of the. 13. 14. They shall never
hold out to the end.
Devil, be unsettled with fears, that notwithstanding all their care they
shall never hold out in faith and an holy course of life unto the end: but by
persecutions or other afflictions and prouocations shall be turned back;
specially considering that they are marvelous apt to slip and cool in time of
peace, and whilst they live under the means of grace. This fear is to be
removed by calling to Mind the promises of God so plentifully and richly set
down in the word of grace. How this temptation is to be removed.
And they must consider, that the same God who keeps them in time of peace,
and blesses the means of grace whilst they do enjoy them, is able and will
uphold them in the time of trouble, and when means be wanting of our selves
we stand not at any time, by his power we may overcome at all times. And when
we are sorest assaulted, he is ever ready at our right hand to support and
stay us that we shall not fall. Psalm. 16.8.
He has well begun, and shall happily go forward in his work, who has in
truth begun. For true grace well planted in the heart, how weak soever, shall
hold out for ever. All total decaies come from this, that the heart was never
truly mollified, nor grace deeply and kindly rooted therein. And as for
present weaknesses it is good to acknowledge and bewail the^, Luke 8.13.
but they must not for some imperfections cast down themselves half
desperately, as though God regarded them not, or they should wither and utterly
decay. For as the dry and thirsty ground or sponge sucketh up much water; so
the humble spirit drinks up much grace, and shall be replenished abundantly
with the waters of comfort. And if their portion of grace be the smallest of
all others, they must strive to grow forward, but without discouragement. For
of small beginnings come great proceedings: of one little spark a mighty
flame: of a small Acorne a mighty Oak; of a grain of Mustard Seed a great
tree: and a little leaven seasoneth the whole lump. All fears and doubts
which arise in their hearts, must drive them to send up earnest prayers to God
daily and often for this grace of faith to be more firmly rooted in them: which
they must do willingly an^ gladly, that they may feel their doubting and
fear to vanish as fast, as they perceive their hold in the promises of God to
wax stronger.

. 14. Satan bears many in hand, that their manifold crosses and troubles in
the world,. 14. 15. They are many ways crossed and afflicted.
and their want of outward blessings, is an argument of Gods displeasure
toward them. This was the fiery dart, which he by the mouths of Eliphas,
Bildad and Tz^phar (yea of his own wife) did shoot at Job; against all which,
if he had not held out the shield of faith he had been pierced through and
through. And we see by daily experience, that when a godly Man is crossed in
his wife, children, goods, reputation, these outward afflictons are often great
occasions of deadly sorrows, and grievous temptations touching the assurance
of his own salvation. The remedy is, To think seriously and to acquaint our
selves familiarlie with the properties of God; the truth, Remedy.
unchangeableness and nature of his promises, Outward crosses are no arguing
of Gods displeasure. Job. 5.17. Pro. ^.12. Iam. 1.12. Heb. 12.7.8.9.10 11.12.
and the manner of his dealing with others of his servants in his wonderful
providence. For thereby we shall learn, that God does love tenderly, when he
does correct severely; and remains unchangeable when our outward condition
does vary and alter: yea, that all his Chastisements are but purgative
medicines to prevent or cure some spiritual disease, which he sees we are
inclined unto. Should God never minister physic till we see it needful,
desire to take it, or be willing of it; alas, we should perish in our
corruptions, and die for want of help in due time. It is good to humble our
selves when god corrects: but to doubt of his love, when he deals lovingly
with us, is a great weakness. Also we should call to mind that God allows,
yea requires, that men in affliction should live by faith, both for a
sanctified use in them, and a good issue out of them in due season. And so
afflictions or earthly encumbrances would be no means to weaken our faith,
but to increase it rather.

. 15. Some godly persons, by the subtle and cruel malice of the Devil are
brought to this bondage,. 15. 16. They are strongly possessed with fear, that
God has utterly cast them off.
that they are persuaded that they are utter reprobates, and have no remedy
against their desperation. And this temptation enough of it self to shake and
terrify the afflicted, is made far more grievous when Melancholy possesses
the party: for that raises excess of distrust and fear, and causes the
party to persuade himself of misery, where there is no cause. In this
weakness Satan assailes such poor servants of God by spiritual suggestion,
tempting them to such sins as be very strange, and such as they abhor the
very least conceit of them, and when by such temptations they are brought low,
in the anguish and bitterness of their souls, the Devil labors especially
to dim their knowledge and judgment, that they may have no sure hold of any
point of doctrine, which may soundly comfort them, that so he may as a roaring
Lion devour them speedily. And when he has covered their hearts with
darkness, and brought them into a dreadful fear of Gods wrath, he holds
them at this vantage, that every thing which is before them, is made matter to
increase their distressed estate. For the stay and comfort of such distressed
souls, How Christians in this distress and anguish are to be comforted.
they are to be persuaded, that they be not under the wrath of God, neither is
his anger kindled against them, for all the fear that oppresses them, when
their estate is in their own feeling at the worst because they have not sinned
against the holy Ghost, nor maliciously set themselves against the truth and
Gospel of God, nor persecuted it wilfully against knowledge and conscience:
which one sin only is able to shut them out from all hope of salvation. And
here they must beware, they make no more sins of that kind, then God
himself has pronounced to be of that sort: for in these matters that concern
Gods Religion, even the perfection of our wisdom is but folly, much more our
sick brains and melancholicke understanding is to be removed far from
handling such holy things. And seeing their consciences do bear them
witness, how much these temptations are repugnant to their desires and liking,
how gladly they would be freed and delivered from them, how grievous and
burdensome they are unto them, and chiefly raised by Satan, who abuses their
simplicity: therefore there is no cause why they should be so discouraged or
out of heart, no more then one that has had a fearful dream when he
awaketh. Moreover, they are with all earnestness to be put in mind (yet with
the spirit of meekness and compassion) and to consider, how much it does
displease God, that they are removed from their faith, and have given place to
conceits and spirits of error, contrary to the most clear and comfortable
promises made them that thirst, repent, fear and love the Lord, tremble at his
word, are brokenhearted, etc. Romans 8.28. James 1.12. Esaias 66.2.
And therefore they should gather more godly boldness and confidence in God on
the one side, and more courage and strength against Satan on the other side.

For if God call and encourage us to trust and rely upon him, and we standing
in need thereof, would most gladly embrace his promises made in Christ Jesus,
who is he that should hinder us? The Scripture, speaking of the malice of
Satan in tempting and assailing Christians, bids them, Be strong and of
good courage, Ephesians. 6.10, 12. 1. Pet. 5.8, 9.
resist strong in the faith: Satan tempts them to overthrow their faith, and
by giving place to fears and doubts they advantage the enemy against their
souls: but let them take occasion by the temptation to draw nigh unto God, and
rowse up themselves more confidently to rest and wait upon the Lord, so shall
they please God, and put Satan to flight. Neither let them after this be still
obiecting, that they feel small strength of faith and hope: for thereby the
enemy may take encouragement to their disadvantage, when fear sets open
the heart to his malicious temptations, and binds the hands of the distressed
that he cannot resist: but let them stir up their courage and resolution to
wait upon the Lord, not listening any more to their strong, but deceitful
fear. And what though they feel not that sweetness, wh ch sometimes they
felt, will they therefore judge their state to be naught? What sweetness can
the soul taste, when it is ouer-whelmed with fears, perplexed with
temptations, troubled with doubts? Physic is unpleasant and bitter to the
taste: Temptation should not be temptation, if it did not affect. If the soul
be now sick, and tastes not the sweet meats of consolation, which it was
wont, as the body which is in a course of Physic; will they judge themselves
to be stark dead, or in a condition irrecouerable? We have experience how
diverse times the disease prevails over the sick person, that actions fail,
and faculties seem quite to be spent; neither hand nor foot is able to do
their duty; the eye is dim, the hearing dull, the taste altered, and the
tongue distasteth all things, even of most pleasant relish; and the weak and
feeble patient seems to attend the time of dissolution: when yet
notwithstanding there remains a secret power of nature, and a forcible spark
of life that ouer-commeth all these infirmities, and consumes them like
dross, and renders to the body a greater purity and firmness of health
then before the sickness it did enjoy. Even so it is in this spiritual
estate, the soul is sick, and not dead, faith is assailed, but not overcome;
and if in patience the fin^shing of this secret work which passes all conceit
and capacity of man be attended, these bu ning feauers of temptations shall
appear to be flaked and cooled by the mercy and grace of Christ, and that
spark of faith which now lies hid and ouer-whelmed with heaps of
temptations, to break forth again: And as nature after a perfect crise
discharges herself, to the recovery of former health: so shall all doubts and
fears and terrors be removed, and strength of faith restored with such
supply, as it shall be able to make evident proof what secret virtue lay hid,
and yet not idle in all this uncomfortable plight. Again, as in outward senses
we see sometimes, and feel, and hear, when we do not perceive it: so we may
also have faith, and not always have the sensible perceiving thereof. Yea,
such as most hunger and thirst after righteousness, and are poor in spirit
and broken in heart, as they doubt and fear in every action lest God be
dishonored by their conversation, so are they jealous of their precious faith,
lest it be not in such measure as they desire, or in truth be none at all:
wherein they may easily be deceived, first, in the discerning, then in the
measure and portion. For when the inward feeling thereof does not answer their
desire and the actions proceeding therefrom do not satisfy their thirst of
righteousness, whereby relief may rise to the nourishment of faith, and the
satisfying of that holy appetite; they are discouraged and entangled with
spiritual cares, from which a more aduiced consideration agreeable to Gods
Word might easily deliver them. And touching the portion, it is a fault to
measure the excellency of faith and power thereof, partly by quantity and
unseasonable fruits, (so to call them) and not by virtue, kind plantation,
soueraignetie, and seasonable fruit: which error in temptation the distressed
are apt to run into, and so to trouble themselves without cause. Men look
not that Corn should spring in harvest, or be ripe in spring; that trees
should bud or bear fruit in winter: because it ^s not the season for such
things. Neither ought we to expect such strength of memory and lively
operative actions of grace, in age, sickness, great sorrows and temptations,
as at other times in young years free from such assaults. The fruits of faith
fit for the season may be discerned by them that can rightly judge, when sweet
refreshings form ly enjoyed be lacking. The effects of faith in great
temptations and cloudie seasons are to look up for help, sigh* groan,
complain to God, prize his favor, draw nigh unto him, and cast himself upon
God, though he seem to be angry: at this time faith is encumbered with many
strong fears wherewith it is burdened, against which it labors, over which
it does not easily nor speedily prevail. Joy, peace, sweet refreshing, and
sensible tasting of Gods mercy, be the fruits of well grown faith in the
times of victory and freedom. Those Summer fruits are not to be gathered in
the depth of winter. It is an error to measure the truth of grace in age by
the effects proper to youth, or the soundness of faith in temptation, by the
effects peculiar to the days of triumph. Neither are we to account the nature
of any thing according to our sense or the show it makes. For then should the
most fruitful tree in winter be taken for barren, and the lusty soil for
dry and unfruitful, whilst it is shut up with the hard frost. But reason
being guided by the Word of God, must lead us rightly to judge of the presence
and life of faith in our souls, which being the shield in this our spiritual
warfare, endures much battering and many brunts, and receives the forefront
of the battle, and oftentimes fares as if it were pierced through and worn:
unfit for battle: yet is it indeed of nature invincible, and repelleth
whatsoever engine the enemy inforceth against us, and stands firm rooted
whatsoever storm Satan raises for the displacing thereof. How then are the
distressed to behave themselves in this temptation, when both the sense of
faith is dulled in them, and the fruits minister coffeehouse? They must
rightly consider what be the winter fruits of faith, and not expect such
things in themselves as agree not to that season, and withal remember that the
gifts and mercy of God is without repentance: and so take courage unto
themselves confidently to cast their souls upon the mercy of the Lord in
Jesus Christ. For as he knew them, when they were strangers from him, and
loved them when they hated him, and had nothing which might provoke his mercy
but sin and misery: so is his goodness continued still upon them for his
own sake, and not at all for their deserving. And though they feel their
ability weak, the enemy strong, their strength tired and clean worn, their
corruption upon the point to p^euaile, the fruits and branches of faith,
through these stormy tempests, nipped and shaken; yet the sap of faith shall
never be dried up in the root, neither can any wind of Satan so blast, that
the immortal seed be at any time quite withered. But patience and constancy
with a resolute mind to bear Gods trial, will bring a good end; yea, by a
meek going under Gods hand in these, they shall learn experience to wade
through greater afterward; and yet in the midst of them, to have hope that
they shall not be ashamed. Say their fo mer course of life past has not
answered that sincerity the Lord requires; what then? Are they therefore
reprobates? No, but it argues want of faith. Not so; but place for fu^ther
in^rease of faith, and the fruits thereof. Those whom the Lord has chosen to
be his worshippers, and has redeemed and consecrated holy to himself, they
be his plants, and engraffed Olive branches in his Son, who take not their
full perfection at once: but (according to the nature of plants) require daily
watering and dressing, whereby by degrees they attain in the end a full
stature in Christ. In Scripture we have example of weak belieuers as well as
of strong. As the Holy Ghost has remembered the faith of Abraham, who believed
above hope under hope: Mark 9.24. John 3.1.
so has it recorded the faith of Nicodemus in knowledge simple and weak, in
profession and practice timorous and fearful. In one and the same person we
shall find different degrees of faith at diverse times; at one time like a
grain of Mustard Seed, Number. 20.11, 12 Psalm. 21.1. and 77.7, 8.
at another time like a grown Oak; now like a smoking snuff, but soon
after bursting out into a bright flame. The strong^st faith of any Saint
menti^ned in Scripture is ^mperfect, assailed with temptations, mixed with
manifold doubtings. For they were subject to innumerables infirmities, which
are not specified in the Book of God; neither was it fit that it should be a
register of their manifold temptations, frailties and falls. But out of those
things which are recorded, we may perceive they were shaken with assaults,
ouer-taken with corruptions, tripped and foiled sometimes by the policy of
Satan. Romans 15.4.
All which is set upon the file for our admonition and consolation. So that a
Christian may not account himself void of grace, because he is not perfect in
faith, knowledge and love: but he is wisely to consider the secret work of
Gods Spirit and grace, and take comfort of the smallest crumme and drop of this
heavenly sustentation, and attend the time of perfect growth according to the
good pleasure of God. Oh, but they feel not the testimony of Gods Spirit,
which might assure them; they can find no spark of grace in themselves.
Neither do any of Gods children at all times feel it: but that they may see
their own frailty, God does as it were hide himself for a season (as a Mother
does from her child to try his affection) that they may with more earnest
desire mourn for Gods wounted grace, and praise him with more ioyfulnesse of
heart when they have obtained it again. And yet God does not withold comfort
from his children, many times when they walk heavenly: but their own frailty
and vehemence of temptation which oppresses them, diminishes the feeling
thereof. When the wind is loud, the air stormy and tempestuous, a man
cannot hear the voice of his friend when the heart is filled with fears, and
perplexed with manifold temptations tossing it up and down, the calm and
still voice of the Spirit is not discerned. And in those seasons, the trial of
faith is to be taken by those fruits which are evident to the eye of others,
who can judge more sincerely then the afflicted themselves in that anguish of
soul and spirit. As the sick man during the time of his distemper, must not
trust to his own taste, but rather rely upon the learned Physicion, and other
honest and discreet friends: so the faithful must not give too much credit to
the suggestions of their own heart possessed with fear, but rather believe
their faithful Pastor, and other godly and experienced Christians that are
about them. But to yield so much to their present weakness (because in this
perplexity they will be ever and anon questioning the soundesse of former
comfort, and integrity of their hearts) suppose they were destitute of grace,
and never had felt sound comfort, should they utterly despair, or give place
to deading sorrow? Math. 11.28.
In no sort, for Christ calls the burdened and laden to come unto him for
ease and comfort. Being destitute of grace and comfort, they are willed to
repair unto him for both, who has sufficient in store for them. If they find
not themselves to be eased, they know they are burdened; if they be not
watered, they feel themselves to be thirsty; if they believe not, they are
allowed, invited, encouraged to come unto Christ: To them he calls, as if he
did particularly name them, Esaias 55.1, 2. John 7.37. Apoc. 22.17. Mark 10.49.
Come ye to the waters and drink; Come unto me, and I will refresh you. Why
stand ye trembling as if your case were desperate? Ye desire help, and he
calls you, Be of good courage, and come unto him.

The Life of Faith. The second part.
CHAP. I.
What it is to live by faith, and how a Christian should stir up himself
thereunto.

MAny and precious are the fruits of ^aith, Inducements, to live by Faith.
whereof we have use at all times, in every state, at every turn, and in all
things that we go about: which who so would enjoy, he must learn not only
to have, but to use it aright; to live by it here; feeding upon the several
promises of mercy, and not only to be saved by it when he goes hence. The
Lord himself, the Author and giver of life, has often taught us, by his
Prophet and Apostle, Hab. 2.4. Romans 1.17. Gal 3.11. Heb. 10.38.
That the just man, is not only to believe to Justification, but to liu^ by
Faith. The worthy servants of God in all ages, are all brought in as a cloud of
witnesses, testifying this truth, that The Just shall live by faith. Gen 5.24.
Heb. 11.5. Genesis 24.40.
By faith Enoch walked with God: By faith Abraham walked before God. Paul
lived, if ever any comfortably, happily, from the time of his conversion, to
the time of his dissolution: but even whilst he lived in the flesh, he lived
by the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. Without faith what ^^e we but dead
moules? living carkases that carry about, and are carried with dead souls?
The best, most excellent and precious part of Man is d stitute of true life
till faith be inspired into it from above, whereby we are united unto Christ
the fountain of supernatural and eternal life. Col. 3.3.4.
The most glorious or pleasant life of Man without faith, is but a vain
shadow, a mere picture and resemblance o^ life, or of death rather, drowned in
carnal delights full of vexation, and leading toward everlasting perdition.
The best work of the regenerate, if it be not animated and quickened by
lively faith, is but the very outside and dull matter of a good and acceptable
work: There is no going right forward in the way to Heaven, 1. Tim 1.5.
if faith be not the guide. The end of the Commandment is love out of a pure
conscience, and faith unfeigned. That which is here called the precept is not
all the law, Iun. animad in Bell Cont. 5. lib. 3. cap. 11. not. 14.
but only the precept that Paul gives to Timothy, that he should have care to
see that there were no strange doctrine admitted neither for form, nor matter,
neither for things directly contrary to wholesome doctrine nor for idle
questions, not tending to build up the people in the love of God, and of their
Neighbor, as appears evidently, Verse 3.
both by the verb before, whereof this word here is derived, and by this same
word used afterward in this chapter, Verse 18.
where the signification of it is restrained unto the present matter of
exhortaion. Nevertheless, it may well be applied to confirm, that every act
of sincere and impartial obedience, must come from a lively, well-rooted and
sovereign faith.

Christ is the fountain of life and faith the mean. Act. 2.15. John 1.4.
Psalm. 36.9. Heb. 5.9.
Christ is the fountain, and faith the means of life. The power and original
of life is entirely reserved to the Lord and Prince of life, the Light and Life
of men, the Author of eternal salvation: But faith is the radical band on our
part, whereby we are tied unto Christ, and live in him. The body has it
soul which enclines it; and so has the soul its soul whereby it lives, and
that is Christ the quickening spirit. 1. Cor. 15.45.
Take away the soul from the body, and earth becomes earth: sever Christ and
the soul, what is it but a dead carrion? The members die if they be separated
from the Head, live so long as they be conjoined to it: Ephesians. 1.22, 23. and
4.16.
Christ is to his Church and every living member of it, what the natural Head
is to the natural members. And so we live primarily and properly by Christ as
by the soul and Head; by faith secondarily, as by the Spirits, the band of
soul and body, or by Nerves and sinews, the ties of the Head and Members.
Look as the leg or arm lives by proper sinews, uniting them to the Head: so
does every belieuer live in Christ by a wel-rooted, sovereign, particular
faith, whereby he receives Christ, and is made one with him. Thus says he
himself, Who is the truth and the life, John 14.6.
I am the resurrection, and the life: he that belieueth in me, John 11.25.
though he were dead, yet shall he live; and, I am the bread of life, John
6.35. John 5.26.
he that belieueth in me shall never hunger; and again, As the Father has
life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself. Thus
speak the holy Scriptures of him, In it was life, and that life was the light
of men; John 1.4. Col. 3.4.
When Christ who is your life shall appear; Our hands have handled the word of
life. For the life was manifested, 1. John 1.2, 3.
and we have scene it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life
which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us. And this is the
testimony of those three heavenly and earthly witnesses, That God has given
to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son; 1. John 5.11, 12.
He that has the Son has life, and he that has not the Son, has not
life. Whatsoever grace we want, it is to be received from Christ, 1. Cor. 1.30.
Who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and
redemption: and whatsoever grace is in Christ for us, it is made ours by faith.
And so we find in diverse passages of Scripture, that he that has faith, 1.
John 5.13.
has the Son, and eternal life in him. This is lively represented unto us
by the Parable of the Vine and the branches, that as the branch receiue^ all
the sap (whereby it lives and is fruitful) from the Vine, John 15.5.
so do we from Christ, being engrafted into him. Life then is from Christ as
the Author, Romans 11.20.
Prince and Fountain: but we live by faith as it incorporateth us into
Christ, and receives him to dwell in our hearts. Ephesians. 3.17.
So that whatsoever we lend to faith, it redounds to the honor of Christ.
Impossible it is, that faith should wax proud toward her Lord, or insolent
over her fellow servants, challenging any thing of desert unto her self. No;
faith receives all of grace as a poor beggar, and altogether excludes the
hateful law of boasting. Rom 3.27. Romans 4.16. Ephesians. 2.8, 9.10
This is the nature, the place, the office of faith: for God ha^h ordained that
life should be through faith, that it might be of mere and rich grace. And
if the end and means appointed of God to lead thereunto, do well consent,
then it cannot be, that faith should lift up her self against grace, or in any
thing seek her own pr^ise, and not the glory of God. Among all the gifts of
God there i^ none more useful then faith: others are profitable for some few
things, this is for this life and the l^fe to come; for all parts and purposes
of our lives, in the use of it manifold, and rich eue^y manner of way: But
evermore it aduanc^th the grace of God, and causes man altogether to disclaim
himself, his ability and worth. Faith se^ueth not only to justify, but to
make us endure in all afflictions without making haste; Hab. 2.4. Esaias ^8.16.
Romans 1.5.
The Just lives, in time of his afflictions by faith; He that belieueth,
makes not haste: It does work in us, and guide the course of our obedience;
We have r^ceiued grace and Apostleship to the obedience of faith, not only in
believing the promise of the Gospel, but the other p^rt or word of command: It
does also prevail against all Enemies; 1. John 5.4.
This is the victory that ouer-commeth the world, even our faith: But in all
this, it leans upon the grace of God, looks to his power and trusts upon
his faithful promise.

To live by Faith, Gal. 3.2. Romans 4.21. Heb. 11.11. What it is to live by faith.
is by faith in Christ to assent and adhere unto, and p^ssesse the whole Word
of God as our own, in all estates and conditions, resting quietly upon his
gracious and faithful promise to receive from his good hand all needful
blessings and comforts in fittest season, and in all good conscience yielding
our selves unto his good pleasure in sincere, universal and constant
obedience. To live by faith is not only to believe in Christ for salvation, or
to believe throughout our life, that we shall be saved in the life to come;
but also to rest upon the grace and free favor of God, that we shall have
whatsoever is expedient to bring us safely thither, given us freely by the Lord
in this life, so far as he knows it good for us. God has made promise of
all good things, more then we could ask or think, Psalm. 34.9 10. Romans 8.28.
that no good thing shall be wanting, that whatsoever comes shall be for our
good: all which the Just man possesses by faith, and is as well satisfied, when
in temptations and trials he has no means of help, as if he had all that
his heart could desire. To the burdened God has promised ease, Math. 11.28.
Esaias 55.1. Ier. 31.34. Esaias 26.1. ^ro. 10.28. Zech. 1.8. 1. Cor. 10.13. Psalm.
91.2, 3. and 84.11. Esaias ^3.28 Math 6.33.
refreshing to the thirsty; pardon to the penitent, comfort to them that
mourn, per^ect peace to them that wait upon the Lord: assistance, comfort,
deliverance to them that be tempted, preservation and protection from evil,
with comfortable supply of all blessings temporal and spiritual so far as
shall be good: all these faith embraces, possesses, feeds upon, and so
rests contented and comforted, as if all help that could be devised, were
present, and comfort inioyed. The word of grace teaches us to deny
ungodliness and worldly lusts, Titus 2.12.
and to live godly, justly and soberly in this present world: from this word of
command faith cannot be wholly turned aside by allurement or terror, but
rests upon God for ability, and sweetly inclines the heart with delight and
cheerfulness to follow after the Lord. Thus to live by faith, is firmly to
rely upon the Word of God, in all estates and conditions, with full purpose to
be guided by it, until the good things contained the^ein be fully
accomplished. This is to be seen in that honorable company of Worthies summed
up by the Apostle, as patterns of faith, Heb. 11.1, 2, 3, 4. etc.
who in all estates and straights whatsoever they were brought into, in all
temptations wherewith they were tried, and in all difficulties wherein they
were exercised, yet so lived by faith, that nothing could dismay them, much
less to overthrow them. By whose example we may learn, so to rest upon Gods
Word and promise for all needful help, assistance, comfort and deliverance,
what danger or difficulty soever befall us, that we be neither dismayed with
terror, nor turned aside with worldly allurements, nor wearied with delays,
nor faint in the combat.

What is to be done, that we might live by faith. Job 22.21, 22. Psalm. 85.8.
Now for the attaining hereof these two things are carefully to be performed.

First, to acquaint our selves familiarly with the Word of God, that we might
have it in readiness for direction and comfort.

Secondly, to exercise faith aright in the Word of God.

The Word of God is the ground of all our faith, whereby we live, be directed,
maintained, and vpheld in all our trials. 2. Pet. 1.4.
The promises of mercy are as so many legacies bequeathed us by our heavenly
Father, and by his Son Jesus Christ, Psalm. 119.105.
in his last Will and Testament: The Commandments are so many directions to
guide in the way of blessedness, John 5.39.
until we be full pertakers of the good things promised: It is therefore most
necessary and behouefull for us to search this Will and Testament for all such
legacies as may concern us: Prou. 6.21, 22.
and to bind this law continually upon the heart, that it might lead, keep
counsel, and comfo^t us as occasion requires. Faith is the li^e of our souls,
the Word is the ground, life, guide, and moderator of our faith. If God shall
lead us into the dark at any time, or bring us into any straight, that we
see no way of escaping, or means of relief, will it not be a great stay and
comfort to our soul, if then we can call to min^e the good Word of God
formerly laid up in store, whence we can raise such hope of help in due time
as may quiet and content us till we do enjoy in effect the good desired? Psalm.
94.19.
When the heart is perplexed with thoughts, distract^d with fears, and
unsettled with temptations, is it not a great refreshing, that we can call to
mind the commandments of God, directing what we must do or leave undone,
instructing in the way of peace wherein our feet shall never stumble? Psalm.
119.24.
If we would be ready and skillful practitioners in the great art of living
by faith, we must exercise our selves in the Word of God, and get into our
hearts and memories, at least, the princip^ll promises and Commandments, that
we may have them in readiness for direction and comfort upon all occasions.
Col. 3.16.
Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom. And here it is to
be observed, that besides express Commandments and direct promises generally
offered, there be sp^ciall promises and Commandments by consequent, which we
are to note and make use of. As whatsoever God promises to any one of his
children, (not in any special or proper respect, only concerning such a person
and for such a time, but) as a common favor belonging to all his children,
that we may, and ought to receive as a promise made to us; Thus the Apostle
diswading from covetousness, applies that promise to all the faithful, which
in special was spoken unto Ioshuah, I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.
Heb. 13.5.
Whenever we find that any of Gods people have prayed for any good thing,
and have bin heard, if it were not by special prerogative peculiar to them, we
may take it as a promise to us. I sought the Lord, and he heard me: and
delivered me from all my fears. Psalm. 34.4, 5, 6
They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his
troubl^s. Wh t favor God has showed unto any of his children, according to
promise and covenant of grace, the same may ^ll that be in covenant with him,
exp^ct and look for. For all the faithful have the same God to be their God,
live under the same covenant, and have in^erest in the same promises of mercy.
Thus James exhorting to patience in trouble, alleges the example of Job, Ye
have heard of the patience of Job, James 5 11.
and have s^ene the end of the Lord. As for extraordinary favors or
deliverances granted unto some persons by special privilege, and not by
ver^ue of common covenant: we cannot promise our selves the same in particular
from their example, nor did the Lord vouchsafe the same to the same persons at
all times: but as such peculiar mercies imply a common ground or reason, they
are unto us arguments of comfort and encouragement. God does not ordinarily
send his Angels to open the prison doors, nor stop the mouths of Lions, nor
quench the force of the fire for the preservation of his people: but from such
extraordinary examples, we may conclude, that God will be with us in the fire
and in the water to deliver or comfort us, Psalm. 91.15. Esaias 43.2. 2. Cor. 4.8,
7.
to succor or support us, that we shall not be forsaken, much less overcome.
Also in the practice of the servants of God, we may learn our duty: for
whatsoever they did upon common grounds and reasons pertaining to us, no less
then unto them, that duty belongs unto us as well as unto them, and their
example is for our imitation. Phil. 3.17. Pro. 2 20.
Special Commandments by privilege given to some peculiar persons, belong
not unto them, who have received no such warrant: but if the immediate ground
be common, the duty it self reaches unto us.

Being acquainted with the Word, if we would live by faith, we m^st exercise
it aright therein, and that con^isteth in diuer^ acts.

First, Faith does firmly and universally assent to the whole Word of God, The
acts of Faith. Acts 24.14.
and set a due price and value upon it, as that which contains the chief good
of Man. The Gospel is that pearl of price in comparison whereof the
merch^ndise of silver and gold are of no worth.

Secondly, It ponders the Word seriously, and treasures it up safe. Earthly men
keep the conueyances and assurances of their Lands very circumspectly, Math.
13.45, 46
lay up their bills and bands, write upon them, know when they expire, and what
to challenge by them. The promises of God unto the faithful soul, are instead
of all assurances, Psalm. 119.11.
bills and bands for his liuelihood, maintenance, protection, assistance,
deliverance, comfort, and everlasting happiness: therefore he is careful to
view them often, lay them up sure, meditate upon their stablenesse and
certainty, and cast with himself what profit and comfort they will bring in
fittest season.

Thirdly, It preserves and keeps in the way of the promises, it persuades,
inciteth and strengthens therein. All the promises of God are free, his favors
of mere grace: but this free favor is in special bequeathed unto the
penitent, meek, humble, upright, that walk in the undefiled way, and do none
iniquity: and faith in these promises, expecting the Lords help all-sufficient
in due season, carries a man forward in the path, Pro. 19.16. Psalm. 119.1, 2,
3.
wherein he shall find rest and peace, and will not be turned out of the
right way, then which it acknowledges none safe or pleasant.

Fourthly, It plies the throne of grace with earnest and continual
supplications, entreating help and succor according unto promise. Faith
hearkeneth what the Lord speaks, and speaks back again in fervent gro^nes
and desires. It has the promise of God, 2. Sam 7 27.
and therefore is bold to pray, and will not keep silence.

Fifthly, It looks up directly unto God, his wisdom, power, mercy, and
faithfulness; If me^nes be present, faith beholds Gods hand in them: if
meane^ be wanting, the eye is lifted up unto the Lord, who can provide means,
or work without means and against means, and most certainly will perform
what he has promised when it shall be for our good. Psalm. 5.3.
My voice shall thou hear in the morning, O Lord, in the morning will I
orderly address unto thee, and will look out.

Sixthly, It rests quietly observing the effects of Gods promises, and
triumphs before the victory. Psalm. 13.5.
I have trusted in thy mercy, my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. But of
these more at large in the particulars following.

Means to stir up our selves to live by faith.
Now for the better stirring up of our selves to live by faith.

Find out thy unbelief.
What a mass of infidelity harbors in my breast? O Lord, I am grossly
ignorant of thy ways, doubtful of thy truth, distrustful of thy power and
goodness, disobedient to thy Commandment. Thou have given rare and excellent
promises in thy holy Word, but I enquire not after them, rejoice not in them,
cleave not unto them in truth and stedfastnes, settle not mine heart upon the^,
make them not mine own, keep them not safe, that I may know what to challenge
by them, prize them not according to the worth and value of the good promised.
Because by a civil faith men believe men, therefore they seek to get their
security, and if they have a man of credit his word for what was desperate,
they are glad; If they have bonds or specialties, they box them up, they know
when they expire, what to challenge by virtue of them, they will do nothing
that may be prejudicial to themselves therein. But as for the promises of life
made in thy Word, I seek them not, build not upon them, hide them not
carefully in my heart, cast not seriously with my self what good I may
ass^redly look for by virtue of them, keep them not continu^lly in thought to
cut off all carn^ll reasonings and d^stractions, am not wary to prevent what
may bring prejudice to my soul and state. Thou threatnest in thy Word, but I
do not fear, am not careful to decline sin. Who is so hardy as to thrust
his finger into the fire? But I have suffered my self often to be carried
aside with lusts through unbelief. How many wicked motions have I entertained?
what sinful passions have I nourished? how vainly, rashly, wickedly have I
spoken, though I have bin warned by thy Word of threatening to the contrary?
True and righteous are thy precepts according to which thou have commanded me
to walk: But I have followed the customs, examples, and traditions of men,
the suggestions of Satan, and allurements of the World. Lust and p^ssion have
often come betwixt my heart and thy holy precepts, whereby I am turned aside from
the strait way of peace. I can find small relish and savor in the Word of
life, I digest it not, feed not upon it, hunger not after it, am not changed
into the nature of it. I receive not the truth, or it abides not in me for
subst^ntiall nourishment: I believe no further then I see, fear no more then I
feel, start aside in temptation.

The Symptoms of unbelief are evident. Symptoms of unbelief.
From this root springs that unmeasurable deadness that presses down.

Psalm 78.19, 21, 22. Numb. 14.27.
For did the heart cleave fast unto God, it would rest quiet in his promise, if
all other things were lacking. Selfe-confidence, resting in means, and leaning
upon them, as lands, riches, Rom 10.3. Ier. 17.5. Psalm. 40.4. and 52.7. Phil.
3.3. Ier. 9.13.
f^iends, etc. are effects of unbelief. He that rejoices in Christ Jesus can
have no confidence in the flesh. As we grow down, denying our wisdom, and
all strength we can make; so does faith in our great God grow up; as we swell
or be puffed up in conceit of our wisdom or strength, so does faith languish
or decay. So much as the heart stays upon the creature, it is by sin
with-drawne from the Creator. But my heart is much poisoned with
selfe-sufficiencie: I feel my self apt to lean upon mine own devices to
presume upon mine own strength, and so wickedly to depart from God. If means
be at hand I grow secure, forgetting, that further then God does send forth his
Word, they can do nothing. If means be wanting, I faint, or at least, am
greatly distracted, not remembering that it is all one with God to save with
many as with few, with small or no means as great. If I enjoy the things I
would, I think much upon the means, ascribe little to Gods blessing: my
affections do work more lively on this or that which fell out (as men speak)
more luckily, then on the blessing of God, which is all in all. In any matter
of weight concerning liueli-hood or state, I am ready to plod what friends I
can make, what means be present, what likelihoods of good success, and here I
rest, not seeking to the Lord, Prou. 29.26.
though all judgment come from him. But if this or that requisite (in my
judgment) cannot be obtained, though I be never so diligent, seek never so
earnestly, still I distrust and suspect the event, saying in heart, that it
cannot prove well. And when my desire is accomplished, the means are still in
mine eye, I think my self indebted to such or such friends, never able to
requite their kindness, when the chief cause, upon whom all things depend, is
much forgotten, not affectionately remembered. In trials I am very tottering,
and like a poor creeple who leans upon his crutches, easily brought to the
ground, when sensible helps are taken away. Carnal delights, Math. 6.30. John
12.43. and 5.44. Math. 14 31. Mark 8.16, 17.
covetousness, love of praise, double diligence about e^rthly things, and
excessive care: these are evil accidents of this disease.





acknowledging him who is my li^e, and the length of my days, nor fearing the
grin that is set for me in every creature and business of this life. What
shall I say? O Lord, I have sinned against thy goodness, power, mercy, and
truth; against the Mediation and blood of Christ. 1. John 5.10.
He that beli^ues not in God, ^akes him a liar, then which what can be more
reproachful? He that rests not upon Christ, makes his blood of none effect,
then which what is more abominable? To fear the threats of Man, to rest on his
Word, to obey his Commandments, when the will and pleasure of God is
neglected; what is this, but to rob Go^ o^ his glory, and set up Man in his
room or steed? If a great Man should threaten, would I not be careful to
decline his wrath? Shall my God threaten, and I be secure and careless? If I
have a man's word or bond that is of worth, I write upon the matter, as if I had
it: Shall I not joyfully rest in the word, seal, and oath of my God? If a Man
of great place should be asked a pawn, and not credited on his word, he would
take it in evil part: what a shame is it, that I should not beli^ue God
further then I have his caution? The servants of Noblemen attend on their Lords
pleasure at an Inch, come at their call, go at their command, do every thing
exactly that is given them in charge: What wretchedness is this in me, that I
have ob^yed the Lord by the halues, been sleightie in his worship, most
negligent where all diligence is no more then duty, most praiseworthy. As I
have dishonored God, Titus 1.15. Esaias 7.9. Numb 20.12. Luke 1.20.
so I have hurt mine own soul. If it were not for unbelief, nothing could
harm me; this does all the mischief: for it rejects the medicines, which
taken, would cure all maladies, and pulls off Gods pla sters, which lying on
would salve our miseries: it defiles our best works, doubleth the bitterness
of crosses, pulls down many judgments upon us, disinableth in the combat
against Satan, is the nurse of spiritual idleness, and hinders the
sweetness of all holy duties. It were just with thee, Dear Father, to cast
me off for ever, and give me over to the vanity of mine unbelieving heart. I
have drawn back from thee by infidelity, Heb. 10.38, 39.
cleaving to the lusts of the flesh and allurements of the World, trusting in
vain devices; and thou might justly forsake me utterly for this mine
hypocritical starting aside from thy testimonies. O Lord, I am not more full
of infidelity by nature, then of my self unable to remove it: unto thee
therefore, do I lift up my soul; O tame in me the fierceness of
infidelity, and teach me to believe as thou have commanded: then shall I
cleave unto thee inseperably, wait confidently on thy salvation, and serve
thee chearefully as long as I live. Thus are we to find out, and make
infidelity odious.

Secondly, We must labor to see the necessity and preciousnesse of faith, 2.
See the necessity and pretiousnesse of Faith.
and these seen, will make a man hold hard ere he part with it. A man that
has a great charge, his whole state about him, will as soon lose his life, as
part with his treasure. Of what excellency and use is this grace of faith,
which subdueth passions, overcomes allurements, makes things impossible to
the flesh, easy and delightsome; inableth to stand fast when we are buffeted
by Satan, lifts up the head amidst all the surges of temptation, remains
victorious in all combats, raises us up when we are laid along, and our
weapons beaten on our Heads; knitteth the heart fast to the heavenly
Commandments, quickens in deadness, and holds the Lord fast when he
leads us into the dark. Who would not prefer the custody and increase of
such a grace before life it self? Nay, what is our life without it? If faith
live in us, we live blessedly, whatsoever misery compass us about; if faith
decay, we die; if it die, we perish.

Thirdly, We m^st consider whom we trust, and meditate on the grounds of faith
(to wit) the grace, 3. Meditate on the grounds of Faith.
power, goodness, truth and unchangeableness of God: for this will strengthen
belief. We must consider the promises of God, that we may see what his good
will and pleasure is, what a Fatherly care of our welfare he has, and not
only how able but how willing also he is to help and succor v^; what promises
he has made, and how faithful he is in performance for his own names sake
and of free undeserved love.

The Mother of unbelief is ignorance of God; his faithfulness, mercy, and
power. Psalm. 9.10.
Those that know thee, will trust in thee. This confirmed Paul, Abraham, Sarah
in the faith. 2. Tim. 1.12. Heb. 11.11. Romans 4.21.
I know whom I have beli^ued, and that he is able to keep that I have
committed unto him, until that day. He is faithful who has promised, and
able also to perform. The free promises of the Lord are all certain, his
Commandments right and good, the recompense of reward inestimably to be
valued above thousands of gold and silver: Trust therefore in the Lord, O my
soul, and follow hard after him. Thou have his free promise, who never failed,
who has promised more then possibly thou could ask or think, who has done
more for thee then ever he promised, who is good and bountiful to the wicked
and ungodly: thou do his work, who is able, and assuredly will bear thee
out; there is a Crown of glory proposed unto thee above all conceit of merit:
stick fast unto his Word, and suffer nothing to divide thee from it. Rest upon
his promises, though he seem to kill thee, cleave unto his st^tutes, though
the flesh lust, the World allure, the Devil tempt by flatteries or threatenings
to the contrary.

4. Feeling weakness of faith look on on Christ.
Fourthly, When we feel our faith weak, we must look up to Christ, the
beginner and finisher of faith in us. A fainting body will taste some thing
that is cordial and restoratiue: and a fainting soul must bait it self with
looking to Jesus, who is our cordial and restoratiue.

5. Pray for the spirit of faith.
Fifthly, Faith is a grace that is given from above and comes down from the
Father of lights unto whom we must fly by fervent prayer, humbly begging, that
he would by his Spirit both reveal unto us what be those precious promises,
which he has made unto his people, and give us wisdom rightly to judge of
them, and firmly to receive them in every estate: and above all, to move our
hearts so to believe them, that we may assure our selves of all needful help
in due time, seeing God alsufficient and faithful has promised it, and wait
upon him in the way of his Commandments. Merciful Father, it is my sincere
desire and unfeigned resolution to draw nigh unto thee, and put my trust in thy
mercies for evermore. But of my self I have no ability to stand in faith, or
to follow hard after thy Commandments; I am full of doubtings, when I can see
no means to put me in hope of help, and ready to sink down in despair:
upon every small occasion I am ready to stagger and slip aside. Take pity
upon me, O Lord, for thy mercy sake, for I fly unto thee for help. Thou have
commanded me to believe, hold me by thy right hand that I shrink not;
reveal thy promises unto my understanding give me a sound judgment,
establish me in the faith more and more, unite my heart close unto thee, that
all the darts of the Devil may fall off, and not be able to wound my
conscience. Thou have given me to see my weakness in faith, and to bewail
it; to see the necessity and excellent use of faith, and to desire it: give me
also steadfastly to believe according to the riches of thy grace, that I may
glorify thy name.

CHAP. II.
What it is to live by faith in particular touching the promises of pardon and
forgiveness, and how to stir up our selves thereunto.

THE use of faith, which is as large as the word of God, must be distinguished
according to the arts and several branches of it, promises, What the promis^s
be, and the kinds thereof.
Commaundemets, threatenings. By promises understand all those declarations of
Gods will, wherein h^e signifies in the Gospel what good he will freely
bestow. And these be either Spiritual or Temporal; concerning this life, or
the life to come of things simply necessary to salvation, or of things good in
themselves, but not always good for us: all which are received, possessed, and
inioyed by faith, according as they be promised of God, either with, or without
limitation. Amongst spiritual promises absolutely necessary, without which
there can be no salvation, the first and chief is concerning pardon or
forgiveness of sins and Justification. The promise of forgiveness of sins.
God of his rich grace and mercy in Jesus Christ does make offer of free and
full forgiveness of all sins to every burdened, thirsty, and peni^ent
soul. Isay 55.7. Deuteronomy. 30.1.2. 1. Reg. 8.35.
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let
him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God for
he will abundantly pardon. Ier. 3.12.
Return thou backe-sliding Israel, says the Lord, and I will not cause mine
anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, says the Lord, and I will not
keep mine anger for ever. I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby
they have sinned against me and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they
have sinned, and whereby they have transsgresed against me. Ier. 33.8. and
1.34. The promise is free.
This promise is made of free and undeserved mercy, not for any merit that is,
or possibly could be in us. I, Isay 43.25. and 44.22.
even I am he that blotteth out thy transgrssions for mine own sake and will
not remember thy sins. I will love them freely, for mine anger is turned away
from him. Hos. 14.4.
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardons iniquity and passes by the
transgression of the remnant of his heritage? Mic. 7.18.
he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy. Heb.
8.12. Ier 31.34. Deuteronomy. 21.8.
I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their
iniquities will I remember no more. Be merciful, O Lord, unto thy people
Israel, whom thou have redeemed. Numb. 14.28. Yet obtained through Christ only.
Ioh. 1.29.
But when we hear of grace, we must remember Christ, in and through whom God
is gracious unto us. Christ is the lamb of God, which takes away the sins
of the world: and this great benefit of forgiveness of si^ne is plentifully
proclaimed unto us miserable sinners, in n^ through him. Thus it is written,
Luke 24.46.47.
and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead the
third day; and that repentance and Remission of sins, should be preached
among all nations, beginni^g at Jerusalem. Be it known unto you therefore,
Act. 13.38.
Men and brethren, that through this Man, (meaning Christ) is preached unto
you the forgiveness of sins. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, 2. Cor.
5.10.
as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ steed, be ye
reconciled to God. Hereunto agrees that inuitation of our Savior; Come unto
me all ye that labor, and are heaven laden, and I will give you rest. This
promise of grace is received, possessed and enjoyed by faith alone, Math.
11.28. And received and possessed by faith.
but by an operative and lively faith, To him give all the prophets witness,
that through his Name, Act. 10.43. Act. 13.39.
whosoever belieueth in him, shall receive remission of sins. And by him all
that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be
justified by the Law of Moses. Though faith be accompanied with other graces,
yet Man lives by it alone, And by it alone.

Romans 1.17. Gal 2.16. and 3.11.24.


not by it and other parts of grace as joint supporters, in as much as by it
alone he trusts in Gods mercy offered in Christ, wholly relying on it, not
partly on mercy, partly on righteousness inherent; We are justified freely by
his grace, Romans 3.24.25.26.
though the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God has set forth to be a
propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
remission of sins that are past. The Scripture foreseeing that God would
justify the Heathen through faith, Gal. 3.8. Genesis 12.3. Genesis 15.6. Romans 4.16.
preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be
blessed. And thus the Lord has ordained for diverse reasons.

If it be by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more
grace. Romans 11.6.
But if it be of works, then is it no more grace, otherwise work is no more
work. Faith answers the promise and receives the pardon of grace as a poor
beggar, utterly denying all worthiness in the subject, whereas other graces,
had they been assigned to this office, would have challenged something to
themselves.



Ier. 9.23.
But faith excludes all boasting in our selves, and teaches us to glory in the
Lord our righteousness. Where is boasting then? it is excluded. By what Law?
Romans 3.27.28.
Of works? Nay, but by the Law of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is
justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. For if Abraham were justified
by works, Romans 4 1.3. Ephesians. 2.8.9.10. 1. Cor. 1.30 31.
he has whereof to glory but not before God. For what says the Scripture,
Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

As God inuites us to receive the promise of pardon offered in the Gospel, Its
necessary to seek pardon of sin by faith.
so it is necessary that we embrace it by a lively faith. For in our selves
we be sinful and cursed, no way able to make any satisfaction, where by we
might be delivered, and remission which is of grace, can be obtained by no
other means, but only by faith n Jesus Christ. To him that works not, Romans
4.5.6.7. Psalm. 32.1.
but belieueth on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness; even as David also describes the blessedness of the Man, unto
whom God imputes righteousness without works; Saying, Blessed are they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; Gal. 1.16. and 3.22.
Blessed is the Man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. Faith goes
directly unto Christ, that by him we might be Justified, and embraces the
promises of God concerning Justification, which is the manner by which alone God
has ordained to justify us. No man can be heir according to the hope of
eternal life, unless he be justified from sin by the free grace of God:
Isay 59.2.
for sins, not blotted out by the free pardon of grace, separate betwixt God
and us, and hide his face from us. Tit. 3.5.7.
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
mercy he saved us etc. That being justified by his grace, we should be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal glory. But no pardon is obtained,
unless the promise of pardon be received by faith. Faith in the promises of
mercy, that we might be acquitted from sin, and accepted as Just and
righteous, does commend and maintain the glory of Gods grace intyre, and in
this respect also it is the more necessary. As a penitent malefactor, if he
were to plead his cause before the Prince himself, would not stand upon
terms of innocence or present integrity, because he had his pardon under
seal, seeing that was given him to plead for mercy, not for justice: so the
faithful soul relyeth upon the free mercy of God and promise of pardon
proclaimed indefinitely to all burdened and penitent sinners, and sealed to
every belieuer in particular by the pledges of the Spirit not upon those
sanctified graces which are given unto him, that he might be qualified and
fitted to plead for grace and mercy.

The acts of faith about promises of pardon.
The acts of Faith concerning this promise of forgiveness be diverse.

First, it generally belieueth the promise true, and thereby disce^nes, that
sin is pardonable through grace. Psalm. 130.4. Luke 15 18.
The knowledge of this, that our sins may be pardoned, or that there is
mercy with the Lord to cover sin, is a work of faith. For whatsoever cannot be
conceived or found out by sense or reason, that is manifested by revelation,
and assented unto or judged true and certain by faith, or else it remains as
a mystery unknown. When the Apostle defines, Heb. 11.1.
faith to be the evidence of things not seen; does he not intimate, that
things unseen to sense or natural reason, are discovered and made evident
only by faith? But that God will pardon iniquity, transgression and sin, is
a truth that can never be comprehended by the light of nature: flesh and blood
has not revealed it unto us. Supernatural truths which exceed all humane
capacity, cannot be discerned or received by any power of nature: 1. Pet.
1.12. Romans 16.25.26. Ephesians. 1.8 9. Isay 40.13 14
But that God will be, merciful to our sins, is a truth supernatural,
hidden from the Angels themselves, until it was revealed in the Gospel. Who
has known the Mind of God or been acquainted with the mysteries of his
wisdom? In the days of security, whilst men sleep in sin, without all
sense of evil, or knowledge of Gods justice, it is an easy matter to say, God
is merciful, Christ died for sinners: But whence the conscience is awakened
with the terrors of Gods wrath, and the fearful sight of sin; Genesis 1.13.
Math. 27.5. Psalm 77.3.7, 8.
the experience both of wicked men, and of the Saints of God can testify, that
it is a difficult thing, to look beyond the cloud of justice, and contrary to
the natural sentence of conscience, comninations of the Law, and present
feeling, to believe, that there is forgiveness with God.

Ioh. 4.10.
and desire is answereble to that certain and clear judgment that we have of
the necessity and worth, value and digni^y of the object apprehended. Now
faith discovers both the necessity and excellency of the good certainly
contained in the word of promise, (which act of faith is signified by the
opening or piercing of the ear) and seriously meditateth upon the singular
benefits offered therein, and so raises the heart incessantly to hunger and
thirst after them. And these des^res will be the greater and more constante,
the more faith is exercised in the meditation of the goodness, freenes and
certainty of these promises. Many things are neglected which are most
precious, only because the value of them lies hid, or is not apparent, or the
prejudice of sensible but deceiuable experience does ouersway. No marvel then
if the pardon of sin be neglected, though the benefit be probably known,
when it is but slightly thought upon superficially looked into, custom having
injured the Mind by long practice to the pursuit of earthly delights or
profits, wherewith it is besotted. But with the true belieuer it fares much
better, for he sees how happy it should be with him, if his sins were
covered, and his soul eased of the burden of them, (how ever it fare with him
in matters of this world) and withal, he pondereth the truth and faithfulness
of the promise made of mere grace, whereby the heart is stirred up to desire
and long after this blessing above all good that can be imagined. And yet, such
is our corruption, we must often breathe our selves in the meditation of these
things, or else we shall find our esteem of pardon to decay, and our desire to
grow cold and dull.

Thirdly, It draws us forward to seek mercy of God. Math. 13.45.46
The wise Merchant first discouers the pearl of price, and then seeks to get
possession of it. The desire of a belieuer is not a dead or sluggish wish, Oh,
that my sins were pardoned, when he never stirs up himself to receive
the promise: But it is a deliberate desire, of a benefit known, possible to
be attained, attended with much comfort, and freely promised by him that cannot
lie, which is ever accompanied with proportionable care to get and possess the
blessing desired; Faith will not suffer a man to smoother or conceal his
desires, nor desires themselves to die: but it perserueth and kindles desires,
and constrains with an holy violence to lay them open before the Lord. Thus
by faith a man comes freely to renounce his title and interest in the world,
and to part with any thing, that might hinder mercy. The wise Merchant having
found the pearl of price, Math. 13.44.
for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has; not as if he could merit
pardon, but that he might be capable of pardon and make a faithful plea for
mercy. To this end also he humbles himself before the throne of grace in true
and unfeigned confession of his sins, freely judging and condemning himself
before God, which a broken and contrite heart. I will declare mine iniquity, I
will be sorry for my sin. Psalm. 38.18.
So the prodigal son coming home to his Father, does bewail his former
lewdness, saying, I have sinned against Heaven and before thee. Pharaoh and
Saul being evidently convinced of sin, Luke 15.18. Psalm. 32.5.
may be constrained in conscience to make some confession to men, I have sinned
this time, and the Lord is righteous: I have played the fool, and erred
exceedingly. Exodus 9.27. 1. Sam. 26.21. 1. Reg. 21.29.
Ahab humbles himself before God, and puts on sackecloth, in hope to
prevent the temporal evil denounced against him and his house: But the
confession of true and unfeigned faith is free and voluntary, in hope of free
pardon and forgiveness. Temporary belieuers may make confession of there
sins with some grief and sorrow, but as they confess their sins, so they
believe: their confession is maimed, and their faith superficial; they
renounce not their interest in the world, which inferres the willing choice of
some inferior good, before the favor and love of God, and their belief of
the promises is shallow and subordi^ate to their base and earthly passions. But
the confession of faith unfeigned is hearty and sincere, joined with a true
detestation of all sin, as that which has, and would make separation betwixt
God and him, if it be not renounced by him, and pardoned of God. And to them
that confess their sins in this manner is the promise made; If we confess
our sins, God is faithful, 1. Ioh. 1.9.
and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
Pro. 28.19.
He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but who so confesses and
forsakes them shall have mercy. Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou
have transgressed against the Lord thy God. Ier. 3.13. 1. Cor. 11.31.
If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged. I said, I will
confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgauest the iniquity of
my sin. Psalm. 32.5.
Which is most lively to be seen in the parable of the prodigal before
mentioned, where the Father (resembling God) is said, to have met his lost
son before he came at him, Luk 15.20.
and to have embraced and kissed him after he was resolved in himself, to
acknowledge and confess his faults. As faith teaches the poor sinner to
humble himself in vnfa^ned confession of his manifould offenses so it stirs
an^ encourages him to power out his soul in ea^nest and hearty prayer unto
God for pardon and forgiveness, Act. 8.22.
through the mediation of Jesus Christ. Thus he is taught of God, Take with
you words and turn to the Lord, Hos. 14 2.
say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we
render the calves of our lips. Both these may be seen in the poor Publican,
who durst not lift up his eyes to Heaven, Luke 18.13.
but smote himself upon the breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
And so the Church prays. O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy
tender mercies speedily prevent us. Joel. 2.17. Psalm, 79.8.
This prayer of faith is not presented before God, in assurance that his sins
be already pardoned but to obtain pardon of the rich mercy of God by and
through the merits of Jesus Christ. And the p^omise is to him that prays
unfeignedly, that he shall be forgiven: 2. Chro. 7.14.
If my people which are called by Name, shall humble themselves and pray, and
seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways: then will I hear from
Heaven, and will forgive their sin. Ask, and it shall be given you: Math.
7.7. Joel. 2.32. Romans 10.13.
seek and ye shall find. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord,
shall be delivered, vizt, from sin and death.

the sight of God: and faith iustifyeth, Ioh. 11.25.26. Act. 15.11. Romans 10.4.
Gal. 2 16. Ephesians. 1.15. Phil. 3.9.
not by any virtue or dignity of it own, but as it receives and rests on
Christ our Righteousness, our Savior, our Redeemer from sin and death. It is
the good pleasure of God revealed in the Gospel, to pardon and justify them
from all their sins, that believe in Christ, and faith justifies as it
leans upon him to receive special mercy through him, or which is all one,
to obtain forgiveness of sinners of the mere and rich grace of God through
him and this is the most formal act of faith as justifying.

I know that my Redeemer lives; Job. 19.25. Psalm. 32.5. Isay 38.17. Psalm.
65.3. Gal. 2.20. 1. Ioh. 3.14.
Thou forgauest the iniquity of my sin; Thou have cast all my sins behind
thy back; As for our transgressions thou shall purge them away: Christ has
loved me, and given himself for me, We know that we are passed from death unto
life, because we love the brethren. These are divine conclusions of a lively
faith: But this persuasion or assurance that our sins are already pardoned,
is not an act of faith justifying, as it iustifyeth, but an act of faith
following justification, a privilege granted of grace to a sinner now set in
the state of grace, or an act of experience in a sinner now justified by faith.
Forgiveness of sins in and through Christ is offered in the Gospel to every
burdened and weary soul, that will receive it as the ground of faith;
vouchsafed to every one that belieueth; but pardon of sin is apprehended as
already granted when we come to be assured that we do believe. Faith in
order of nature is precedent to Justification, but Justification it self goes
before the sense thereof. As faith obtains and receives the promise of
special mercy it does not find us Just when we begin to believe, but makes
us Just by embracing the Righteousness of Christ as it certifyeth and assures
of favor, it does not actiuely Justify but finds the thing d^ne already.
Faith assures of the pardon of sin by a double act. First, it lays hold
upon the general promises made to Belieuers, such as these; John 3.18. Acts
13.39. John 3.36.
He that belieueth shall be saved; By faith every one that belieueth is
justified; He that beli^ueth has everlasting life: Secondly, it concludes
undoubtedly from them, That he believing is already received into favor, and
has obained remission of sins. Now betwixt these two comes the testimonies
of the renewed Conscience, 1. Cor. ^.11.
working upon the soul by reflection, whereby the true Belieuer is made privy
to his own estate, and assured that he does believe. The whole is collected
thus; He that belieueth in Christ is already Justified, or has received
pardon and forgiveness: This is the voice of faith, grounding it self upon
the express testimony of God speaking in holy Scripture. But I believe: This
is the witness of the renewed conscience, enlightened by the Spirit, and
directed by the Word, whereby the Belieuer comes to know what God has wrought
in him. For no man can be said to Believe that he does Believe: but he
belieueth the promises by faith, and knows himself to be a Belieuer by the
w^tnesse of his Conscience, renewed by the Spirit. The conclusion of faith,
grounded upon the former propositions, the one expressed in Scripture, the
other evident by the witness of Conscience is, Therefore my sins are
forgiven, or I shall be saved. The order of climbing to this assurance, is the
rather to be marked, that weak Christians, who want the comfortable sense and
feeling of this mercy, might learn to seek it in due order, as the way is
laid down before them in the Word; and not deiect themselves without cause, as
though they were utterly destitute of faith in Christ, because they want the
sense of this assurance, and so could do nothing acceptable, because it is not
done in faith; nor tire themselves in a preposterous course, not know^ng where
to lay the foundation or begin their work.

Three prerogatives do ever accompany this confident assurance of our
Reconciliation with God. Three prerogatives that accompany confident assurance.


Esaias 59.2. Phil 4.7.
Even that peace of God which passes understanding, and is in stead of a guard
to keep our hearts and minds in Christ; that golden Legacy which Christ
bequeathed unto his Disciples, when he left the World. John 14 27. Ephesians.
2.16, 17. Romans 5.1.
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. Being justified by faith, we
have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And from this peace begins
lively consolation against the temptations of sin, Satan and the World: from
the sense hereof the faithful soul may triumph with David, The Lord is with
me, Psalm. 56.4. Rom 8.33.34.
I will not fear what man can do unto me; and with the Apostle, Who shall lay
any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that justifies: who is he
that condemns.

Romans 5.2. Ephesians 2.8.
By whom (sc. Christ) also we have access by faith, into this grace wherein
we stand.

unspeakable and glorious, 1. Pet. 1.8.
which does so lift the faithful above the Heavens, that being cheared with
the Essence of Gods favor, and contented with Christ alone, they despise the
world and the base things therein. Romans 5.2, 3.
We rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in
tribulations also. Thus David prayed, Psalm. 51.8, 12.
Make me to hear joy and gladness; Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.
All these rare and precious privileges spring from faith: for without faith no
man can please God, Heb. 11.8.
by faith we have peace with God, by faith we come unto him, by faith we
rejoice in him. Romans 15.13. Phil. 1.25.
The God of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing. In whom we have
boldness and access, with confidence by the faith of him. But this faith
which highly adu^nceth the Belieuer to boast in God all the day long, lifts
not up it self, waxes not proud toward the Lord. Free remission, sweet
peace, assurance of Gods favor, familiar and heavenly communion with him, and
whatsoever rich token of special and entire good will God bestows, these
cannot puff up, but abase the Belieuer in himself: the higher he is exalted
by the free mercy of God, the lower he humbles himself before God. Ezekiel.
16.62, 63 and 36.31, 32.
I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shall know that I am the
Lord: That thou may remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth
any more: because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that
thou have done says the Lord God.

Romans 4.5.
God justifies the ungodly: but by ungodly in that sentence of Paul, he is
meant, who does not bring his works or merits, nor look to his graces,
qualities, acts or virtues in the matter of Justification: but does bewail his
impiety, and fly to the throne of grace for pardon, being convinced of
guiltiness. Thus Abraham was all his time comprehended in this Catalogue, and
is made by the Apostle, as a perpetual, so a principal instance of that
final resolution: Romans 3.28.
Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the works of
the Law. For if believing in him that iustifie^h the ungodly, was imputed for
righteousness unto Abraham, after he had been for a long time more righteous
then the ordinary sort of Gods Sa^nts or chosen, Abraham all this while
vnfain^dly believed himself to be a sinner, no way justified in himself, but
seeking to be justified by him, who if he show not mercy to sinners, whilst
they be sinners, all mankind should perish utterly. The drift and scope of
Paul in the third and fourth to the Romans is only this: That although men may
be truly just and holy in respect of others, and rich in all manner of works,
as Abraham was thus far known and approved, not by men only, but by God: yet
when they appear before Gods Tribunal, who best knows as well the
imperfection, as the truth of their integrity, they still acknowledge
themselves to be unprofitable servants, always praying, Lord, forgive us our
sins, and be merciful to our offenses. So that all men, even the most holy
are sinners in themselves, and in the sight of God in the Apostles sense, and
are justified by grace not of debt, after the infusion of supernatural
holiness. The sincere and upright man, in whose spirit there is no guile,
Psalm. 32.1, 2. Romans 4.4, 5, 6.
is justified, not because of his sincerity, but because the Lord imputes not
that sin unto him, which he still unfeignedly acknowledges to be in him,
continually praying, Lord, enter not into judgment with thy servant; always
confessing, Lord, in thy sight no flesh living can be justified, Psalm. 143.2.
to wit, otherwise then by not entering into judgment, or by non-imputation of
his sins. And faith that lays hold upon the promise of mercy offered in
Christ, causes a man every day to humble himself for sin, and to seek
pardon by earnest prayer every day it receives and feeds upon the promises
made in Christ, and so assures that his sins are done away as a mist. And
thus a Christian may live by faith for many days, or rather all the daye^ of
his life, in sweet peace and commun^on with God, if he will lea^ne to
maintain, and t^ke pains to use his faith aright. It is to be lamented that
amongst Christians, who desire to live honestly and keep a good conscience, so
few know, so many neglect the ordinary use and improuement of their faith; as
if it served only to give them comfort in the rem^ssion of sins at their
first conversion, and then had finished all it should or could do, except till
they fall into some notable decay, if not great offense, or be plunged into
deep doubts, or be exercised with some great afflictions: whereas the daily
use and improuement of faith for the continuance and increase of assurance of
forgiveness, peace, access unto the throne of grace, Joy, and communion with
God, is as necessary, should be as constant as is the use of Fire and Water,
of the Light, of Meat or Drink or whatsoever is more ordinary for the comfort
of the Body. Serves faith for entrance and beginnings, and not for
continuance, progress and encreasings? Is faith the breeder and bringer forth
of Joy and Peace, and not the Nurse and foster Mother of them, cherishing and
feeding them, till we come to a full and perfect age in Christ? All fruits the
nearer they come to ripeness, the sweeter they be: and so is the fruit of
faith, sweeter in the ear then in the blade. If the sense of pardon be
pleasant and delightsome at the first, must it not increase as strength of
faith and spiritual acquaintance with God increases? Is it not easier to
preserve peace, then to recover out of dumpes and distresses? Every day to
reckon with our souls, and get our debts cancelled, then to do it now and
then, when we have run far behind hand, not knowing which way to turn our
selves? Fire once kindled is kept burning with less pains, then being often
quenched, it can be kindled. The labor of maintaining health is much less,
then the toil of recovering out of sickness. Let us then learn to make use
of our faith every day; As every day to humble our selves before the throne of
grace, and beg the pardon and forgiveness of our sins; every day to look
unto the grounds of comfort, and meditate thereupon, that we may find joy and
sweetness therein; every day to renew our faith in believing the pardon of
such particular offenses as we have espied in our selves that day, and
confessed before the Lord with sighs and groans for mercy. Let us think
seriously with our selves, how excellent a thing it is to be in league of
amity with God; how blessed and pleasant a state to be freed from the fear
of death and Hell; how rich and comfortable a thing to be Heir of Glory. Let
us often stir up our selves to converse with Christ; the better we know him,
Psalm. 139.17, 18 and 36.7. 2. Tim. 1.6.
the more delight and contentment we shall take in fellowship and communion
with him. This is to live by faith, and to stir up the grace that God has
given us. This is to maintain faith, that it may serve us. Fire in the embers
glowes not, heats not the house: Faith in the heart not used, does neither
increase, nor comfort. A man may well be said not to have the wealth, he vs^th
not for his benefit: surely he wants the benefit of faith, who exercises it
not. Use limbs, and have limbs. The beauty and benefit, yea, the very
increase and perfection of all gifts, virtues and graces consists in use, and
action. Exercise perfecteth understanding and memory; strengthens the
disposition of the soul, increases vigor, begets promptness: the more
thou do, the more thou may. The oftener the liberal man gives Alms, and
does good turns, the more his liberality grows and shines. Let any man
diligently and ^hroughly improve his faith, and great will be his faith, and
great the joy it will bring in. It is our fault, if we suffer Satan with light
temptations, ordinarily to interrupt our spiritual mirth, or to detain us in
dumps and pensiveness. Did we but carefully maintain our faith, it would do
away all d stu^bance which is within us against our selves, and tame the
rebellion of lust against the spirit of the mind renewed; it would secure us
against the power of enemies inward or outward, that they should not be able to
hurt us, much less to prevail against us, and repress or vanquish all
perturbations, which spiritual wickednesses, unbelief, want of godly
contenta^ion, defects in our condition, might occasion: it would expel
unquietness, keep under passions, allay fe^res and griefs, and calm the
boisterous storms of discontent. Let us keep our faith, and it will keep our
Joy: It will keep it an even euer-flowing current, without ebb and flow,
clouds and eclipses: let us increase our faith, it will increase our joy. But
to what measure of Joy may a grown Christian attain, To what measure of joy a
Christian may attain.
if he be careful to p^eserue and stir up his faith? It is a small thing
for him to come to an ordinary pitch of cheerfulness, except his joy exceeds
the mirth of a worldling in the quality and quantity of it. If his mirth be
not a sweeter and more rauishing mirth, of an higher kind, of a more pure
nature, of a most constant tenure, then any carnal man's what-euer, he
disparages faith. The Christians joy, 1 Pet. 1.8. Romans 14.17.
is joy unspeakable and glorious, joy in the Holy Ghost, another manner of Joy
then ever entered into the heart of a natural man. So is that text to be
construed, 1. Cor. 2.9, 10.
eye has not seen, etc. not chiefly of the joys of Heaven, which here the
spiritual man himself cannot tell what they shall be, but of the Gospels
joy, Calu. in 1. Cor. ^.9. Iun. par. lib. 2. pa. 31.
of the wine and fatlings already prepared, and now revealed to the Belieuer
by the Spirit: which if the carnal man scorn and scoff at, it is because he
cannot comprehend it. It is a more pure and constant joy, which needs not the
support of earthly delights: his joy is within, he joys in the favor of God,
which is unchangeable. It beseemes not a Christian to be merry in one estate,
dumpish in another, as if their joy depended upon their outward condition. No,
no, the favor of God alone is sufficient to uphold a good man's joy. John
16.22. Romans 5.3. James 1.2.
Your joy no man takes from you, We glory in tribulations also: And great
reason, for if sin be pardoned, every thing causes a progress of
salvation. Were it not odious to see one professing some l berall Science, to
live by lewd and dishonest shif^ing? No better fight is it to see a Christian
hanging his joy upon course and earthly pleasures, who has more noble and
generous, yea, Angelical delights, then which what has Heaven better but in
degree only and manner of fruition? Psalm. 36.7, 8, 9.
How excellent is thy l^uing kindness, O God, therefore the children of men
put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abundantly
satisfied with the fatness of thy house: and thou shall make them drink of
the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy
light shall we see light. It is a pleasure to him to want other pleasures, who
is often and every day serious in the meditation of the remission of his sins,
the free grace and eternal love of God toward him in Jesus Christ. He that is
every day busied to fetch out a pardon of course for his daily infirmities, and
to make even reckoning betwixt God and his Soul, that nothing remain on the
score to interrupt his peace, shall neither be idle, nor unprofitable; neither
want employment, nor comfort. This course can open no gap to licentiousness,
liberty in sin, Psalm. 19.12, 13.
or carnal security: for he is ever most studious not to run into
arrerages, who is most desirous to have his debts cancelled and blotted out.
Faith is of the nature of sovereign purifying waters, which so wash off the
corruption of the ulcer, that they cool the heat, and stay the spread of the
infection, and by degrees heal the same. And of Cordials, which so comfort and
ease the heart, as also they expel noxious humors, and strengthen nature
against them. Justifying faith takes kindly rooting in a clean heart, and
being rooted purifieth it more and more. Faith that pleads for mercy, does
cleave to the Commandments, stir up to holiness, overrule the affections,
delight in purity, and diffuse the virtue of the word into every faculty of
the soul.

It may be objected, If faith certify that our sins be pardoned, and there
be such joy in believing, how comes it to pass that many good Christians live
so long in fear and doubt, Wence it is that many good Christians live so long
in fear and doub^.
who would be contented to take any pains to be settled in assurance of Gods
love? The common causes of this slownesse of belief are many.

to seek that which was lost, Math. 18.11. Esaias. 61.1.2. Math. 9.13. 1. Pet.
3.18. Romans 5.10. Math. 11.28.
to bind up the broken hearted, and to save sinners. He died for his enemies,
for the unworthy: He inuiteth the burdened to come unto him, and makes suit to
the poor and worthless, that he might ease and enrich them. If they were not
unworthy, what need had they of Gods mercy? or how should God glorify the
riches of his mercy in pardoning their offenses? The feeling of their
unworthiness makes them fit to receive mercy from God who does v^uchsafe it
freely: seeing besides their sin which makes them unworthy, they have a sense
of it, and an heart broken for it. If they were not unworthy, they could no^
believe: If their case had not been desperate, what need was there, that
Christ should come from the bosom of his Father? Esaias. 43.25. and 44.22. Hos.
14.3.4.
Pardon is offered freely of grace, the more vile they be in themselves, the
fitter to receive this undeserved kindness. Oh, but their sins are grievous
and notorious, scarlet, crying, scandalous sins? This detestation of sin is
greatly to be commended, if they remember withal, Ezra. 10.2.
that there is hope in Israel concerning this: if they will set one eye upon
the mercy of God, as they set the other upon the vileness of their iniquities.
If their sins be many and great, Ephesians. 2.4. Psalm. 3^.5. Psalm. 51.1.2. Exodus
34.6.7. Esaias. 55.9.
God is rich in mercy, abundant in goodness, has a multitude of tender
mercies; His mercy reaches above the Heavens, he forgiueth iniquity,
transgressio^, sin and rebellion. All faults are easily pardonable to his
infinite mercy, which exceeds Man's, as Heaven does Earth; which can readilier
forgive seventy, then Man seven offenses. Was not Adam, Manasses, Paul, the
sinful woman commonly called Mary Magdalene, 2 Chronicles. 33.12.13. 1. Tim.
1.13.15. Act. 2.37.38. Luke 7.^7.
the Cretians and Jews who imbrewed their hands in the blood of Christ,
received of him to mercy? Does not ^e delight to forgive much, that he may
bind to love much? Shall not his favor superabound to the sense of faith,
where sin has abounded to the wounding of Conscience? It matters not what
the wound is, so Christ be the Physician. John 1.7. Esaias 1.18.
The blood of Christ cleanses us from all sin. Nothing but the blood of
Christ can wash away the guilt of the least sin; and his blood is sufficient to
purge the most polluted Conscience. But they have felt no extraordinary measure
of sorrow for sin, they are rather dull and senseless? Are they weary of
sin? have they sorrowed to self-denial and to renounce their interest in
whatsoever might separate betwixt Christ and them? To such is the word of
Reconciliation sent. But they have often slipped into the same sins. There is
a difference of offenses. There be sins of ignorance, infirmity,
forgetfulness, and sudden passion, whereunto the heart yields not advised
consent, and from which the faithful by reason of their frailty can never be
free in this life, in some degree or other. Now unto these God of his mercy is
pleased to grant a pardon of course, 1. John 1.8. 1. John. 2.2.
notwithstanding his servants step often into them through weakness, provided
they humble themselves, seek mercy, and labor the mortification of their
infirmities. Abraham twice denied Sarah to be his wife, saying, She is my
Sister. Of David it is recorded, that though he were a man after Gods own
heart in all things, except the matter of Vriah, yet of frailty he offended
many times in the same particular. There be foul, enormious notorious sins,
which wound the conscience, and stop and hinder the lively operation of grace;
and these m^st be repented of, and advisedly left and fors^ken, before we can
believe to the pardon and forgiveness of them. Nevertheless, if a man have
often fallen into these offenses, he is not to despair, but seriously to
confess, and to forsake hi^ sin, that he may obtain mercy. For the Lord
inuiteth the obstinate and rebellious to repent, and by word and oath assures
them of forgiveness, if they will return. And if we look upon examples, we
shall find many such, who upon humiliation and earnest prayer have been
received unto mercy. But they have fallen grievously since conversion. So did
David and Peter, who yet recovered by grace, and upon repentance were forgiven.
A foul offense after grace received is not unpardonable. The blood of Christ,
which washes away the guilt of sins before conversion, is sufficient to
purge the conscience from sins after conversion likewise; We are commanded to
repent of, taught to pray for the pardon of sins without exception. It is of
free mercy that former sins are covered, and by the same mercy of God this
trangression may be pardo^ed. The mercy of God is everlasting, his covenant
unchangeable, though we be unfaithful, yet he cannot forget himself. He
delights to show mercy, and rejoices in the soul that has sinned, but now
lamenteth, saying, I have sinned, and it did not profit me. The commandment
of god, inioyning us to forgive our brother not seven times but seventy times
seven times if he repent, is an expression of his readiness to show mercy to
them who do often and grevously offend, if they return by unfeigned repentance,
and sue for mercy. Oh, then take heed, that to other great and many sins
infidelity be not added. Doubting begets deadness, whereas look^ng up unto
the promises of mercy, will both ease and soften the heart. But they cannot
believe. Indee^e they think there is no promise of mercy made to them, upon
which they should ground their confidence. Therefore they must know; that God
calls them, in his word to come unto him, as if he did particularly name
them, and promises to receive them unto mercy; and then they must consider of
the fr^e grace of God in promising, and his faithfulness in making good
whatsoever he has promised, that neither want of feeling, nor conceit of
unworthiness dis-hearten them from drawing nigh unto him. They must think
seriously with themselves, I need mercy, and the Lord has promised it: I
thirst after it, and the Lord will grant unto me my desire according to his
promise: I am utterly undone if I obtain not help; and help is not to be
found, but in the Lord Jesus, who lovingly inuiteth me to come unto him, that I
may be refreshed. Seeing therefore I long for mercy and, the Lord makes offer
of it in his dearly beloved Son, I will go unto him and humble my soul
before the throne of his grace, I will entreat mercy, and roll my soul upon
the promise of salvation. All my help is to look off my self an object of
confusion, and look upon Christ an object of consolation, therefore I cleave
unto him as mine only Savior, and trust in him though he should kill me. It
does not please God, that I should stand alooffe and strain courtesy, now he
encourages me to come with confidence, or give way to doubtings, now I have
his promise, who never failed any that trusted in him, who has done more for
me then ever he promised: therefore I will go unto him in the mediation of
Jesus Christ, and importune his grace; if I perish I will perish in his bosom,
to die for it nothing shall s perate me from his mercy.



Isa. 55.1. Ioh. 7 37. Numb. 21.9.
and does truly, earnestly, fervently thirst to be eased of it, he has a
calling to come unto Christ to ask, obtain, and receive mercy. He that was
bitten with the fiery serpent, was appointed to look up to the brazen
Serpent, that he might recover. Oh then delay no longer, be not held back
with vain objections and causeless scruples. Math. 11.28. 1. Ioh. 3.24.
Behold, he calls thee to come, why should thou fear in respect of thy
vileness? Faith is obedience and obedience is more acceptable then courtesy and
complement. The sooner thou come, the better welcome. It is rudeness, and
not good manners, not to do as thou art bidden to do, yea, and so earnestly
persuaded, entreated and charged to do. To do the work of God is to believe
in him, whom he has sealed and sent to be thy Savior. Ioh. 6.29.
And sh^lt thou not ten times more honor and please him in trusting upon his
mercies, and sealing to his truth, then in fearing his justice, and dreading
his power?

Oh, every one that thirsts, Reu. 22.17. Isay. 55.1.2. Ioh. 7.37.38.
come ye to the waters; He that belieueth, out of his belly shall flow
rivers of water of life. The barren in grace must come unto Christ to be
supplied of his fullness. Gal. 3.14.
By faith we receive the promised Spirit. He that walloweth in sin, is not
fitted to believe, for justifying faith can never take sound rooting in the
heart which is not resolved to forgo the practice, and have cast off the love
of all sin: but when a man is weary of sin, and finds emptiness of grace;
as he is commanded to pray for mercy, and the gifts of grace, so is he to
believe in Christ, for the obtaining of both. Wherefore study, strive, endeavor
to believe, and lay hold on the Rock, as in danger of drowning a man will do
on the tree or post that comes next to hand. When thou have, in thy conceit,
most cause to despair, labor against it: When thou have no reason in thy
apprehension to believe, believe with all thy power; when the favor of God is
lost to thy feeling, it may be present to thy faith, which discerns what is
promised, though to sense it have no being. And for thine encouragement, set
before thine eyes Christ's freedom to all suitors in the time of his flesh,
repelling none who truly desi^ed the price of his blood. There be other causes
of this weakness, Directions to the weak to stir up themselves to be when
they feel no comfort.
which have been mentioned, and answered before.

Now if any poor and weak Christian desire to know (as he desires nothing
more) how he should stir up himself to believe the promise of forgiveness
when he wants the comfort of it, yea, when to his own sense he feels the
contrary.

Ier 3.13.
O Lord, I have sinned, and thou art justly displeased: I have cast off thy
law, and thy wrath is kindled against me. My heart trembles at the
apprehension of thy sore dispeasure, and I am afraid of thy judgments. All
this is come upon me by reason of my foolishness: Psalm. 38.5.
my smart and sorrow is bred in mine own bosom. I have no rest in my bones
because of my sin. Psalm. 38 3.
But, dear Father, I look unto thee for mercy in Jesus Christ, I beseech
thee, take away the transgression of thy servant. 2. Sam. 24 10.
It is thy property to show mercy, it is thy free promise to pardon the
iniquities, transgressions and sins of thy people that turn unto thee, and
pray: for thy Names sake be favorable to mine iniquities, and remember my sin
no more: cast them behind thy back, Exodus 34.6.7. 1. Reg 8.33.34. Isa. 43.25.
and 44.22. Isal. 38.17. Mic. 7.18. Psalm. 52.2.
do them away as a mist, and bury them in perpetual oblivion. I have gone
astray like a lost sheep, but now my desire is to return home unto thee: With
my whole heart I desire thy favor, O suffer me not to perish under the burden
of my sin. Remember not to my reuoltings from thy Commandments: but
according to the multitude of thy tender compassions remember me for thy
goodness sake, O Lo^d. Truth it is, I am not worthy to be called thy son, or
to be pertaker of the least crumme of thy mercy: But thou art a most loving and
compassionate Father, who dealest not according to the iniquities of thy
children that trespass against thee, Number. 14.19. Psalm. 103.10.
nor rewardest them according to their deserts: who retainest not thine anger
for ever, because mercy pleases thee. If thou will be merciful to my sin,
then shall thy glory appear, my heart shall be enflamed with thy love, I
shall walk in thy fear, and my tongue shall sing of thy goodness.

Secondly, He must rowse and stir up himself to believe, with reasons drawn
from the promises, and covenant of God made in Jesus Christ, considerations
taken out of the Word and experience of his dealing with other his servants in
former times. Psalm. 4^.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, why art thou disquieted within me? Trust
in God, and cast thy burden upon him, for he will ease thee. Math. 11.28.
Esaias 55.1, 2. Mic. 7.19. Psalm. 65.3. Psalm. 85.2. Esaias. 1.18. 2 Cor. 5.19, 20. 1
John 3.23.
Thou have his promise confirmed by oath and covenant, that he will cast thy
sins into the bottom of the Sea, purge away thy transgressions, fo^giue
thine iniquities, cover all thine infirmities, and never remember them any
more. Behold, he persuades, entreats, beseeches, commands thee to
believe: why art thou afraid? It is the will of God that thou should rest on
his mercy: he cannot be offended for that which himself commands, nor
deny that which he has promised. Romans 5.20. Ephesians. 5.2. and 1.7.
If sin abound, mercy shall abound much more. His burning wrath is pacified
in Jesus Christ, who has given himself an offering and a sacrifice to God for
a sweet smelling savor, that grace might glorify herself in the pardoning
of thy offenses. Have thou nothing to bring before him but sin and impiety
that he abhors? He looks upon thee in his dear Son Jesus Christ, Romans
3.25. Hosea 14.3.
whom he has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, and
loves freely. Do thou require testimonies of his undeserved kindness? God
so loved the world, John 3.16.
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever belieueth in him, should
not perish, but have everlasting life: Esaias 54.8. Ezekiel. 16 60.
He has entered into a free and everlasting covenant with thee, and waited long
for thy conversion when thou wentest astray: and will he not much more have
mercy upon thee now thou prayest? Why art thou dismayed at the sight of thy
great unworthiness? Misery is the object of mercy: Acts 9.11.
the greater thy distress, the more glorious will be the grace of God in thy
deliverance. The ba^er thou art in thine own sight, the fitter to believe: for
faith excludes all conceit of worth, and receives pardon as a mere gift of
grace. Sinful men, whose compassions are not as the drop of a bucket to the
huge Ocean, if compared with the infinite Sea of mercy which is in our God,
must forgive their Brethren till seventy times seven times, Luke 17.34.
if they sin against them, and repent: Our God, who requires so much of us,
who have nothing but what he gives, will he not deal tenderly with the poor
soul, which has sinned, and repents? God has done more for us then for
shame we could desire, before we asked any thing at his hand; yea, when we
sought to excuse our disobedience, and charge the fault upon his Highness:
what will he not do, when we accuse our selves, and pray for mercy? My soul,
nothing can hurt thee, but unbelief. Thou art wounded by sin: Believe in
Christ, and by his blood thou art healed. God is angry: Believe, and thou art
reconciled: All variance cease, when thou art knit unto Christ. Wherefore
shake off d^strust, hearken no longer to the assaults of Satan: but roll thy
self upon the Lord, and stick fast unto his mercy. If thou want the sense of
his love, thou have his promise that he will be good unto thee: cleave unto it
above all thou can feel, see or comprehend. O my God I will trust in thee,
though thou should kill me: I will believe thy favor, when thou frownest
upon me: and expect comfort when I lie groaning under the heavy weight of thy
displeasure. Thou causest man for a time to possess the sins which thou have
pardoned: and I will believe the pardon of my sins, when thou se^mest to set
them in order before my face.

and offerest rich treasures of goodness to them, that lay hold upon them;
create in me the hand of faith, that I may effectually receive what in mercy
thou reachest forth. The knowledge of faith is of thee, as is the gift it
self: give me the Spirit of revelation, that I may discern truly what thou
have given me, that my lips may sing of thy praise all the day long.

Why God deferreth to grant the profit of forgiveness.
that he might confirm faith, train thee up in obedience, try thy patience,
preserve his graces, and do thee good in the later end. Thou art already
blessed, because the grant of pardon is sealed, and received: the sense of
deliverance pertains to the execution, which for a little season is deferred,
that it may be perfected with greater glory to God, and comfort to thy self.
Blessed be the Lord, who has turned away his eyes from my transgressions, but
has not turned away his mercy from me. Rejoice in the Lord, O my soul, again
I say, rejoice: for he has covered thine iniquities, and purged away thy
sin, that thou shall not die. Oh, the blessedness of that man, whose
iniquities are forgiven, to whom the Lord imputes no sin.



CHAP. III.
What it is to live by faith touching the promises of Sanctification, and how
to stir up our selves thereunto.

Of the promises of sanctification.
THe next spiritual promises of things absolutely necessary to salvation are
concerning Sanctification, or the killing of sin and quickening us to
newness of life, by the continued infusion of holiness: and renouation of our
hearts according to Gods Image, and to the enabling us to walk in new
obedience according to covenant. And this is signified by the general terms
of subduing, saving, washing, cleansi^g, and purging from sin and iniquity.
Mic 7.18, 19.
Who is a God like unto thee, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the
trangression of the remnant of his heritage? he retains not his anger for
ever, because he delights in mercy. He will turn again, he will have
compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities, and thou will cast all
their sins into the depths of the Sea. Math. 1.21.
He shall save his p ople from their sin; which as it is true in the matter
of our Justification for the forgiveness of our sin; so also in the point of
Sanctification, for delivering us from the power of sin. And so are the like
general speeches to be understood, John 1 29. 1 John 2.2. 1 John ^.7.
that Christ is the Lamb of God, which tak^th away the sins of the world,
that he was manifested to take away our sins, that the blood of Christ
cleanses us from all sin, Apoc. 1.5.
that he loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. And this is
that which the Lord of his free mercy promised to effect, for his Church and
people, Esaias 4.3, 4.
And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that
remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written
among the living in Jerusalem. When the Lord shall have washed away the filth
of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the
midst thereof, by the Spirit of Judgment, and by the spirit of burning.

Now seeing we have such promises from God, it follows necessarily, that a
Christian is allowed to believe, A Christian is allowed to believe these
promises.
that God of his free grace in Christ, will purge him from the filthy
remainders of sin, and renew him more and more after his own Image, in
righteousness and true holiness.

to take away their hearts of stone, Ezekiel. 11.19. Ier. 31.33. and 32.40. Ezekiel.
36.26, 27
and to give them hearts of flesh; to put his law in their inward parts, and
write it in their hearts; to put his fear in their hearts, that they shall not
depart from him: and to give them a new heart, and to put his Spirit within
them. But what God promises, faith receives. It is no presumption, but true
obedience to assure our selves from God, of whatsoever he has past his
promise and entered into band and covenant freely to give.

If any man thirst, Revel. 22.17. John 7.37. Verse 38.
let him come unto me, and drink. He that belieueth on me, as the Scripture
says, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. Christ is the
fountain of grace and the well of life, euer-flowing and ever full, John 1.16.
Col. 1.19. Ephesians. 1 23. Col. 3.10, 11. Col. 2.10.
of whose fulness every Belieuer does receive grace for grace, who fills all
in all, who is all in all, in whom we are complete, filled with all heavenly
graces, which serve to remove evil, or set us in state of blessedness. There
is no grace but from Christ: no communion with Christ, but by faith. From
Christ we receive to believe; and from him believing, we daily suck the life
of grace. Christ is made unto us of God, Wisdom and Sanctification, 1. Cor.
1.30.
as well as Righteousness and Redemption: and as it is our duty to believe in
Christ for pardon of sin, so to embrace him by faith for sanctification, and
to be filled with his gifts of grace in our measure.

Apoc. 1.5. Ephesians. 1.3. 2. Pet. 1.3.
even all things that pertain to glory in the world to come, and to live godly
in this present world. But what Christ has purchased, that we may assuredly
believe God will bestow: He will not withold any thing, that he has
graciously given to our Savior on our behalf.

Col. 1.9, 10.
We cease not to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the
knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding: That ye
might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good
work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. 1. These 5.23.
And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly. But what we are taught and
commanded to beg in prayer, we are allowed to believe, that we shall obtain
it of free grace.

Ph. 1.20. 2. Tim. 4.18. Ph. 4.13.
But all the faithful, as faithful be partners in the same promises and
privileges, and live by the same faith.

to cast off the old man, which is corrupt, Ephesians. 4.21, 22, 23, 24.
with the affections and lusts, and to put on the New man, which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness: But in the covenant of Grace, God
gives what he requires: Man's duty is his free gift of grace.

It is necessary to believe God will sanctify our nature, and enable to
holiness.
It is necessary a Christian should believe, that God will sanctify his nature,
and enable him to those duties of holiness and righteousness that he requires.

Romans 8.1, 2. 1. Cor. 1.30.
them he does sanctify by his Spirit to walk before him in newness of life.
Christ himself cannot be divided, nor the participation of his benefits: If by
communion in his death, we be delivered from the curse and malediction of the
Law, by the power of his Resurrection, we are raised up to live unto God.





God will forward, and succeed well, that he will bring to perf^ction.

The promises of God concerning spiritual blessings are so l^nked together,
that whosoever belieueth not every one aright, he cannot believe any one
steadfastly as he ought. He shall many times be in doubt of the remission of
his sins, and in fear of falling away, who has not learned to rest upon God
for the grace of sanctification, no less then for the pardon of his offenses:
for the certainty of both these is like, if it be well considered.

The acts of faith about the promises of sanctification.
The acts of Faith concerning these promises be these and such like.

First, It acquaints a man with his emptiness of grace, the strength of his
inbred corruptions, how deep they have eaten, how fast they stick, how unable
he is to crucify his inordinate affections, or to repair the decayed Image of
God in him, and that be is in woeful case, unless the Lord put to his helping
hand. Faith in this act does not properly work upon the promise, but prepares
the heart thereunto. And sure it is a worthy lesson: for the serious thought of
this matter is exceeding forcible to abase and humble him in his own eyes, and
so wholly to drive him out of himself. For he perceives, he is as strongly
bound by the tyranny of sin to perpetual slavery, as by the guilt of sin
to the danger of condemnation. Could he get pardon for sin, what would this
profit, so as he lies still under the power and dominion of sin, from which
he has no ability to deliver his soul. If a man labor of some painful,
loathsome incurable disease, though in many things he be advanced, this will
pull down conceits of greatness: and when a Christian comes to see, how many
dangerous, noisome, spiritual diseases he labors under, he is not lightly
affected with it: no, he abhors himself, and cries out, Rom 7 24.
O miserable wretch that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death,
how shall I be cured of these maladies. Hereby also he is drawn in all his
purposes and r^solutions to deny himself, and to rely upon the power of the
Lord, who only remaynes victorious. He purposes, but through the might of
God: which causes earnest and hearty prayer to be strengthened unto, and
established in that which is good. I will keep thy statutes: Psalm 119.8.
O forsake me not utterly. I have stuck unto thy Testimonies: O Lord, put me
not to shame. Psalm. 119.32, 33.
I will run the way of thy Commandments, when thou shall enlarge my heart,
Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I shall keep it unto the end.
Verse 34.
Give me understanding and I shall keep thy Law, yea, I will observe it with
my whole heart. Make me to go in the path of thy Commandments, for therein
do I delight. Incline my heart to thy testimonies, Verse 35. Psalm. 17.5.
and not to covetousness. Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps
slip not. Purposes thus grounded bring forth holy performances: but when they
are taken up without consideration of our frailty, and we rely not upon
Christ for his grace and assistance, they quickly vanish and come to nothing.
In the time of sickness, danger, disgrace, we make fair promises to amend
what is amiss, and reform things out of order: but when the rod is removed,
shortly all is clean forgotten. What may be the reason? We stand upon our own
feet, presume to go alone, of our selves, by our own strength, and then no
marvel if we fall and catch many a knock.

Cant. 5.6, 7, 8.
sensible of want and emptiness, and therefore attends upon the Lord in the
use of all such means, whereby he is pleased to conueigh Christ unto us for
our spiritual filling. The labourious Be is early abroad to gather, when
there is an honey fall: and faith is early awake to wait upon the Lord in his
ordinances, when he showers his blessings upon his people. But it knows to
distinguish betwixt the ordinances in and by which grace is obtained, and the
Author and Giver of it. And thi^ vrge^h the Belieuer earnestly to beg the
blessing of God upon his own ordinances, without which they cannot avail us.

Luke 19.26. Math. 13.12.
To him that has, that is, that uses well what he has received, shall be
given, and he shall have in abundance. Grace is given freely, not deserved by
works: but by the appointment of God, he that would increase therein, must
religiously employ what he possesses. Men increase their substance by labor
and pains, their learning by diligence: and he that best improueth graces
received, shall most abound therein.

Create in me a clean heart, Psalm. 51.10.
O God, and renew a right spirit within me.



Acts 15.9.
Look what (...) full treasure of all sorts of graces Christ has stored up in
him, faith draws and drives them out of his fulness to the use of each
several Christian, even grace for grace. John 1.16. John 15.1, 5, 6.
It fetches sap from the root Christ, which makes every tree bring forth
fruit in it kind, every Christian in his own calling. As water brought by
pipes from the fountain to the cock, does come faster or slower, as the pipes
be wider or narrower, open or stopped: so grace does flow from Christ into our
hearts more or less, as our faith is weaker or stronger in degree and measure.
Faith opens (as it were) the passages of grace, that it may distill more
plentifully upon us. And thus by fetching supernatural efficacy from the
death and life of Christ, it changes the heart, creates and infuseth new
principles of action, begets a pliable willingness unto every thing that is
good, and conueigheth both will and ability thereunto: as the medicine curing
the vicious stomach, and restoring it to health makes it long for wholesome
meat, as before for coals and ashes. By the precious promises which we have
from God (when they are ours by faith) 2. Pet. 1.4.
we are made partakers of the divine nature, or the graces of the Holy Ghost.

The p^eposterous care and travel of many well-affected, is to be pitied, who
study the practice of this or that virtue, The true cause why men labor in
vain to practice some particular virtue.
neglecting this cardinal and radical virtue; as if men should water all the
branches of a Tree, and not the root. Feign would they abound and shine in
patience, meekness, zeal, yet establish and root not themselves in faith,
that should maintain all the rest. If water come not to the cock we use to
open or amend the pipes or leads that conueigh it from the spring: Christ is
the wel-spring of grace, if we would have our wants supplied we must labor
steadfastly to believe. All defects in sanctification must admonish us to look
to our faith. Thirst drives men to the Sp^ings of water: col^ forces them to
the fire: weakness or want of grace should move us to come unto Christ by a
lively faith. Esaias 55.1.
Oh, every one that thirsts come ye to the waters. To give way to doubting
because the graces of Gods Spirit be weak and feeble in us, is, as if a man
should refuse to eat, because he is faint for want of sustenance.

Romans 7.25.
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I my self
serve the Law of God. The least measure of sanctifying grace is in it self an
unspeakable benefit, considering the poison of our corrupt nature; and also a
pledge of future favors to be received, till the work be perfected. God in
great wisdom powers the graces of his Spirit upon us by degrees, and does not
perfectly sanctify us at once, least we should forget what great things he
does for us in forgiving our daily trespasses, and curing the grievous and
loathsome diseases of our polluted souls: 1. Cor. 1.9. 1. These. 5.24. Romans
11.29. Phil. 1 6.
but the beginning of sanctification is an earnest of further grace to be
vouchsafed, till the work be finished to the praise of his grace, which does
appear the more, in that the gifts of grace, are communicated by degrees.

The means to stir up to believe that God will sanctify, when we see
nothing but discomfort.
The way or means whereby a Christian may stir up his faith to believe that
God will sanctify him, when he sees nothing but thraldom and sin
prevailing, and feels nothing but deadness of heart, is this.

foolish; the will perverse and rebellious: all the affections out of order:
there is nothing whole or sound within me. Night and day I am pestered with
sinful motions. The desires of my sinful heart be so strong and prevailing,
that I am carried headlong to that which is evil. The body is weary after
labor, and requires rest, but sin is ever stirring, never quiet, no not when
occasions be wanting. And that it might appear out of measure sinful, it
takes occasion by the commandment, it resideth the good motions of the Spirit,
it disin^bleth to every good work, it diffuseth it venom into every action,
and leads captive to the committing of sin against knowledge and
conscience. The cursed earth is not so apt to be ouer-growne with weeds,
briars, thorns and thistles, as the soul with lusts, passions, distempers,
worldly cares, and sinful delights. The law of the flesh rebelleth against the
law of the mind, and carries with violence to the works of darkness. The
Gally-slaues condition is very hard and miserable: but the spiritual
bond-slaue is in far worse estate. No drudgerie so base as the service of
sin, no Tyrant so cruel as sin, which allows no respite, or time of
refreshing. Romans 7.24.
O miserable man that I am, who shall deliver me from this dominion of sin,
this body of death. I have deeply defiled my self by transgression, but have
no power to cleanse my heart: O Lord, I have defaced thine Image, but cannot
repair it: I have yielded the powers of my soul to the obedience of sin, and
now I would cast off that subjection and break those snares, I am altogether
insufficient for it. When I would do well, evil is present with me: Romans 7.21.
but I find no means to perfect what I desire. I cannot desire good, my will
is so in bondage: I am not able to crawle about the doing of that which is
good, such is my feebleness: but I want no strength to that which is evil, I
am apt and ready to go astray. I am environed and beset with sin on every
side; oh, when shall I be set at liberty, that I might do the work of God,
and run the race of his Commandments.

and satisfies the poor, that he might be acknowledged the wel-spring of all
grace and goodness.

to power water upon the thirsty, Esaias 44.3. and 35.7. Joel 2.28.
and rivers upon the dry ground: I pray thee, wash me thoroughly from my
filthiness, and water me bountifully with the dew of thy grace, which may
cool and allay the scorching heat of sin. Zech 13.1.
Thou have opened a fountain to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness: let the streams thereof flow upon my
dry and barren soul, that it may be fruitful in the works of holiness. O
put thy good Spirit into me, which may be as a fountain of living waters
springing unto eternal life.



CHAP. IIII.
What it is to live by Faith concerning the promises of everlasting life.

AS if it were a light thing, that God should forgive all our sins, Psalm.
103.3, 4.
and heal our infirmities, he has given promise of everlasting life to be
conferred of his rich grace upon them that believe in Jesus Christ. God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
belieueth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. Eternal life
is promised. John 3.16.
And Christ has purchased life everlasting no less for us, then
righteousness: Heb. 10.19, 20.
By the blood of Jesus we may be hold to enter into the Holiest, by the new and
living way which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say,
His flesh. For this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament, Heb. 9.15.
that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions, that were
under the first Testament, they which are called, might receive the promise of
eternal inheritance. And therefore as he is said to have made reconciliation
for iniquity, Dan. 9.24. 2 Timothy 1.10.
and to have brought in everlasting righteousness: so also to have abolished
death, and brought life and immortality to light. And he makes promise of
everlasting life to them that hear and obey his voice. John 10.27, 28. Mark
16.16. Acts 16.31. John 6.40. and 20 31. 1 John 2.25.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; And I give unto
them eternal life, and they shall never perish. In the Gospel we find
eternal life promised upon condition of faith in Christ; Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shall be saved: and what God promises of free grace,
that faith does certainly receive. Life is promised upon condition of faith,
and by faith we are quickened, entitled unto, and made pertakers of life
everlasting. John 3.36.
He that belieueth on the Son, has everlasting life; He that hears my
Word, and belieueth on him that sent me, has everlasting life, John 5.24.
and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life. This
is the record, 1 John 5.11, 12, 13.
that God has giu^n to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He
that has the Son has life; and he that not the Son, has not life. If
once we be b^ought to believe in Christ, life et^rnall is then begun in us.
This is life eternal, John 17.3.
to know (that is, with the knowledge of faith) thee to be the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent. Col. 3.4. Ephesians. 3.17.
For Christ is our life, who dwells in our hearts by faith: and therefore
whosoever believe in him, have life through and with him. And this life is not
another, but one in substance with that blessed and glorious estate, which the
Saints enjoy in Heaven, though different in degree. Again, when first we
believe, then we are entitled to life everlasting, and so have the
accomplishment of glory in respect of right and propriety. 1. Pet. 1.3.4.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
his abundant mercy, has begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the
resurrection of Jesus from the dead, To an inheritance incorruptible, and
undefiled, and that fades not away. That being justified by his grace, we
should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. For if when we
were enemies, we were reconciled to God, Titus 3.7.
by the death of his Son: much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by
his life. They which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of
righteousness, Romans 5.10. Verse 17.
shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. To an earthly inheritance title
follows upon the birth; to the spiritual upon our Adoption. But when we
believe in Christ, we are then made the Sons of God by Adoption, yea, sons
accepted. To as many as received him, Ephesians. 1.6. John 1.12.
to them gave he privilege to become the Sons of God, even to them that
believe on his Name. Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon
us, that we should be called the Sons of God. Beloved, 1. John 3.1, 2.
now are we the Sons of God, Gal. 3.26, 29.
and it does not yet appear, what we shall be. For ye are all the children of
God by faith in Christ Jesus, etc. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's
seed, and hei^es according to the promise. Gal. 4.4, 5.
When the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman,
made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law, Verse 7.
that we might receive the adoption of Sons. Wherefore thou art no more a
servant, but a son; Rom 8 14.
and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. For as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God, Verse 17. Heb. 12.23. Therefore
we must believe it.
etc. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with
Christ. And for this cause the faithful^ are called the Church of the first
begotten, whose names are writ n in Heaven. Now if eternal life be promised
in the Gospel, purchased by Christ, and in right and title belong unto the
faithful, we may conclude it is our part and duty to believe in God through
Jesus Christ, as well for the obtaining of eternal life to be given of grace,
as the forgiveness of our sins.

It is very necessary to believe it.
Heb. 10.35, 36.
Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of
reward: for ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of
God, ye might receive the promise. Abraham is commended in Scripture, that he
left his friends, his native Country, and all earthly hopes there, which were
not small, and came to dwell in a strange Land, as a Pilgrim, where he
suffered many injuries, Heb. 11.8, 9, 10.
an^ was exercised with many troubles of sundry kinds: all which he endured
with invincible patience, by the hope and desire of eternal life, and that
heavenly Country whereunto he was called. The hope of Heaven is the firm and
sure anchor of the soul, to sustain and stablish it that it be not tossed up
and down and ouer-whelmed with reproaches and indignities Heb. 6 19.
offered with the worldly losses and miseries of this life.

It serves also to establish our hearts against sundry worldly cares and
fears, affectation of earthly greatness and carking for earthly necessaries.
For why should we admire the glory of this life, when most excellent glory,
riches and happiness joined with it, is prepared and given us through faith in
Christ? Why should we doubt of earthly necessaries, when God has bequeathed
unto us an heavenly kingdom. Faith in Christ to receive an incorruptible
crown of glory will moderate desires of earthly things, that we shall neither
admire, nor aspire after great things below, nor basely did ust the Lord for
supply of what he knows meet and convenient for us. Fear not little flock,
Luke 12.32.
for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.

1. Cor. 9.25.
By faith some were tortured, not accepting deliverance, Heb. 11.35.
that they might obtain a better resurrection. Let us run with patience unto
the race that is set before us, Looking unto Jesus, Heb. 12.1.2.
the Author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him,
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of
the throne of God.

The acts of faith concerning these promises be these. The acts of faith
concerning these promises.


Ephesians. 2.8.
not in respect of present salvation or redemption, whereof here we are
pertakers, but in respect of glorification to come, in due time to be revealed.
Believe on the Lord Jesus, Act. 16.31.
and thou shall he saved. By faith we have access into this grace, Romans 5.2.
wherein we stand, and rejoice in the hope of glory. When the Apostle says,
With the heart Man belieueth unto righteousness, Romans 10.10.
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. H^e does not so
distinguish these two, as if faith were the cause of righteousness, confession
of salvation; or as if faith were sufficient to righteousness, but not to
salvation: for he had often said, Romans 4 16.
that we are saved by faith, that the promise is by faith: But he describes
the qualification of that faith which iustifyeth and saves, namely, that it is
a steadfast affiance, that flies to God by hearty supplication, and breaks
forth into profession of Gods name. The promise is, Romans 10.11.
Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: and faith
herein, flies to the throne of grace with ardent supplications, and lays
hold of salvation promised of grace.

Romans 6.23.
The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord: and if it be a
gift of mere favor, it cannot be of works. Ephesians. 2.8.9.10. Gal. 3.18.
If the inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to
Abraham by promise. And that which God will do about his children in the day
of judgment, is called mercy. 2. Tim. 1.18.
The Lord show mercy to Onesiphorus in that day. The immediate cause of life is
Gods grace, as the immediate cause of death is sin. Romans 5.21.
But if life be of grace, it is by faith. We are kept by the power of God
through faith unto salvation. 1. Pet. 1.5.
So that our faith never gives over, till we come to be actually possessed of
the immortal and undefiled inheritance, reserved for us in Heaven.

Gal. 3.14.
Because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your
hearts, crying, Ezekiel. 34.29. Gal. 4 6. Romans 8.15.
Abba Father. The holy Ghost does first infuse the grace of faith into our
hearts, whereby we believe: but believing, and being made the sons of God,
we receive the Spirit more fully and manifestly, dwelling in us to
sanctification, and assurance of our Redemption. By the benefit of the holy
Ghost faith springs in us, by which faith the abundance of the selfsame
spirit is increased: and so of a greater faith, is still made a greater
increase of the Spirit. In whom after ye believed, Ephe. 1.13.
ye were sealed with the Spirit of promise. He that belieueth, John. 7.38.
out of his belly, shall flow rivers of living water. And these gifts of the
Spirit, which we receive by faith from Christ our Head, are the beginnings of
that glorious life we expect and look for; one in substance, different in
degrees: and according to the measure of grace received, so is the life of
glory begun in us.

Math. 6.21.
raises the heart to things above, and directs the conversation, according
to the policy of the new Jerusalem. Life etern^ll is not given for works,
but it is the good pleasure of God, that his children should be holy and
exercise themselves in all good works. Romans 8.13. Gal. 6.8.
If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
He that sows to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Blessed are the pure in heart, Math. 5 8.
for they shall see God. Follow peace with all men, and holiness, Heb. 12.14.
without which no man shall see the Lord. Charge them that be rich in this
world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in
the living God, who gives richly all things to enjoy. That they do good, that
they be rich in good works ready to distribute, willing to communicate; 1.
Tim. 6.17.18.19.
Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come,
that they may lay hold on eternal life. But ye beloved, building up your
selves in your most holy faith, praying in the holy Ghost, keep your selves in
the love of God, Jude verse 20.21. Iam. 1.12.25. Math. 35.34.35.
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. Come y^e
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world. For I was hungered, and ye gave me meat, etc. These and such
like passages of Scripture show, not the cause why, but the qualification of
the persons unto whom; not how it is deserved, but what does precede the
bestowing of life eternal. And faith that looks for that blessed hope and
lays hold upon the promise of that heavenly and incorruptible inheritance,
lifts up the heart into Heaven, kindles love, inflameth with zeal,
encourage h against difficulties, and inciteth to run the way of Gods
Commandments. If probable hope of great advantage draws on the Merchant to
undertake a long and tedious voyage by Sea, notwithstanding the many casualties
and perils wherewith it is beset: faith in the assured promises of God
concerning salvation, will set a man forward in his Christian journey, hold him
on in his way with courage and cheerfulness; and hearten him to the works of
godliness notwithstanding the temptations of Satan, the allurements of the
world, or oppositions of the flesh to the contrary. Phil. 3.20.
Our conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look for the Savior, the
Lord Jesus Christ. Col. 1.3.4.5.
We give thanks to God, and since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,
and of the love which ye hau to all the Saints, For the hope which is laid up
for you in Heaven. Heb. 11.13 14.15.16.
By faith Abraham, Isa^c, and Jacob confessed that they were pilgrims and
strangers on the earth, and having opportunity would not return into their
own country, because they desired a better country, that is, an heavenly.

it exercises it self upon the many gracious promises, whereby God does
freely pass it upon us, Ps. 119.5.6.
and earnestly beggeth the powerful effectual inhabitation of the Spirit to
stamp and imprint the Image of Christ more and more upon the soul; it
peruseth it evidence again and again, and nourishes the motions, stirs up
the graces of the Spirit, which is the earnest penny and se^le of the promised
inheritance. If Men make an earthly purchase, they will spare no cost or labor
to get it assured, they will have good evidence, fine and recovery and take
what course in time may exempt it from claim; and faith receiving the promise
of this purchased in^eritance, will not rest in uncertainties or presumption,
but does travail to have it assuredly passed and made upon the soul.

Sixthly, It strives to enter the possession of this heavenly kingdom by
degrees. Phil. 3.10.12.13.
Men that purchase an inheritance to come in hereafter, they are glad if any
part fall into their hands for the present, or if they can get some by parcels,
before the whole be possessed. Fullness of glory is reserved to the life to
come: but beginnings of glory, peace of conscience, joy in the holy Ghost, and
sanctification of the Spirit, are vouchsafed here. Grace is the beginning of
glory, and glory the perfection of grace. According to the measure of grace
received, and as we grow up in Sanctification, so we enter upon the possession
of our eternal inheritance. And true lively faith does covet grace more and
more and draw unto it self from Christ's fullness.

Seventhly, It earnestly desires and longs after the full accomplishment of
glory. Romans 8.13.
Our selves also which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we our selves
groan within our selves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the redemption of
the Body. I desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better.
Phil. 1.23.
Salvation is the end of faith: Heaven the habitation or home of the faithful.
For in this we groan earnestly, 2. Cor. 5.2.
desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which is from Heaven. Natural
bodies move to their proper place; all living things covet perfection in their
kind: heaven is the proper place and condition of the faithful, life
eue^lasting the perfection of faith: therefore if faith be lively; it longs
after the fruition of glory, and full possession of the promised inheritance.

1 John 3.1.
Behold what love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called
the sons of God. Beloved, Verse 2.
now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be:
Verse 14.
We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the
brethren. Neither does the manner of speaking savor of ought but certainty,
neither could it agree with the gravity of the Apostle to speak so
indefinitely, so indeterminately of that, whereof he had no certain ground,
no firm resolution, but only some likely guess, or coniecturall hope. And
grant it of John and the Apostles that they knew their own Adopt^on, and we
may infer, that this knowledge is a privilege of all belieuers in their
measure as well as theirs. 2. Pet. 1.1. Romans 8.34.35.36 37. 1. John 2.2. Romans
5.1.2.3.
For the faith whereby they were assured, was ordinary; the grounds of
assurance common to them with all true belieuers; the benefit it self
general* not in any special manner appropriated. What promises soever
concerning life and happiness were made to the Apostles, the same are made to
all belieuers, and confirmed and sealed unto them after the same manner. For
they have all one God, Ephesians 4.4.5.6.
one Christ, one Spirit they are under one Covenant, and live by the same
faith. The Adoption of Belieuers is confirmed on Gods part unto them by his
word, seals, oath, pledge and witness of his Spirit with the graces thereof.
And what God so sufficiently confirms, we by faith may receive it: for faith
inableth us to believe what God reuealeth. Faith gives assurance, but every
belieuer is not assured in himself, Psalm. 31.22. and 77.7. Psalm. 42.5. and
43.3. Exodus 19.5. Psalm. 135.4. Cant. 7.6. Psa. 16.5. Deuteronomy 32.9. Psalm. 83.3.
Mal. 3.17. Zech. 2.8. Psalm. 108.6. and 127.2. Cant. 8.6. Esaias 49.16. Ioh 14.23.
I^s. 1.9. Psalm. 109.31. and 12.5. Psalm. 73.23. Psalm. 27.5. 1. Sam 2.9. Psalm
56.8. Math. 10.30. Psalm. 38.9. Ier. 31.20. Deuteronomy. 33.29. 1. Pet. 5.10. Phil.
4.19. Psalm. 62.2.6.7. and 71.5. Joel 3.16. 2. Cor. 1.3. Psalm. 25 12. Heb.
13.21. Exo. 29.46. Reave. 21.3 2. Chron 16.9. Psalm. 37 4. and 145.19. Prou.
10.24.
nor is any assurance in this life, so certain, that it is never intermixed,
nor disturbed with doubtings. There is a state in which faith shewe^h it self,
rather in earnest longings and paintings after mercy, then in certain
apprehension of it: there is a state of infancy, a state of temptation and
spiritual conflict, in which the soul cannot attain this certainty and
assurance. And even in the grown and confirmed state the belieuer must not
look to walk on smoothly without any rubs, or to enjoy perfect assurance
without doubtings and assaults. The assurance of this belieuer is an assurance
aiming and striving after assurance; an assurance wrestling and combating with
many assaults: an assurance which labors wi^h continual weakness and looks
not to come to perfection but by temptations. But of this before.

God in great mercy does vouchsafe to his Adopted sons many excellent
royalties in this life. They are most precious unto him, His chief treasure,
His love for delights, his peculiar people, the lot of his inheritance, his
chosen, his hidden ones his jewels. He that touches them, touches the apple
of his eye. They are his Beloved, as the signet upon his right hand. He
dwells with them, he follows them whither soever they go; he stands at
their right hand, and holds them up by it. He coue^s them under his pauillion,
he keeps their feet, he counts their wanderings, he numbreth their heirs,
he obser^es their sighs, is moved with compassion upon their complaints, he
is the shield of their help, the sword of their excellency, and the God of
all grace, who will fulfill all their necessities. He is their hope, their
help, their health, their rock, their refuge, the Father of mercies and God
of all consolation. He will teach them in the way that they should choose, and
make them perfect in good works: He will establish them in every good word and
work, he will walk with them, his eye is ever upon them for good, and he will
give them their hearts desire. They have the Angels of God to minister unto
them for the^r safeguard and protection; Heb. 1.14. Psalm 34 7. 1. Cor. 3.22.23.
Heb. 2.7.8. 1. Tim 4.2.3.
they have dominion over the creatures of the earth, and the free use of them,
both for necessity and delight. This is a true saying; The charter anciently
given by that great Lord of all at our first conversion, touching the use of
his creatures, was forfeited into the hands of the Doner by Adams fall. But it
is restored and renewed by Christ to them who a^e honored with the Adoption.
The heirs of heaven are the right inheritors of the earth. The Sons of God,
by Adoption are Brethren and Coheires with Christ whom the Father has
appointed heir of all things: Romans 8.17.
and hence arises unto them the holy use of ^he creatures, Heb. 1.2.
and ministry of the Angels. Are chastisements needful or behooffull for
them? Iere. 46.28. Esaias. 54.8. Heb. 12.10, 11. Ier. 24.5. Esaias 27.9. Psalm.
89.31.32. 1. Pet 4.14. Romans 8.28. Acts of Faith that arise from the privileges
of the godly.
He will correct them in measure, for a moment f^r good, to take away sin:
but his loving kindness he will not take from them, nor suffer his
faithfulness to fail. Are they loaded with reproaches for righteousness
sake? The Spirit of glory, and of God shall rest upon them. In a word
whatsoever may happen, All things shall work together for the best unto them.
And seeing God has prepared and promised such excellent privileges unto his
children in this life, hence it is, that faith rests upon his grace to
receive from him whatsoever may be good and profitable for them. O how great is
the goodness, which thou have laid up for them that fear thee: Psalm. 31.19.
which thou have wrought for them that trust in thee, before the sons of men?
Verse 20.
Thou shall hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou
shall keep them secretly in a pauilion, Psalm. 36.7.
from the strife of tongues. How excellent is thy loving kindness, O Lord;
therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
verse. 8.
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fullness of thy house: and thou
shall make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. The Lord is my shepherd,
Psalm. 23.1.
I shall not want. He shall lead his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather
the lambs with his arm, Esaias 40 11.
and carry them in this bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.
What can they want, Psalm. 146.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Leuit. 26.12. 2. Cor. 6.16. Prou.
10.24. Esaias 49.15, 16. Deuteronomy. 14.2.
who have god to be their Father, to provide for them, and protect them; to
bless them and dwell with them; to succor them, and supply them with all
needful blessings spiritual and bodily, in fittest season: whose ear is open
to their desires, whose compassions exceed the tenderness of a mother to her
sucking babe: who has chosen them to be his own proper good which he loves,
and keeps in store for himself and for special use. Thou Israel art my
servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend. Esaias 41 8, 9.
Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the
chief men thereof, and said unto thee; Thou art my servant, I have chosen
th^e, and not cast thee away. Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Verse 10.
be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help
thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. Verse
17.
When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue
fails for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the Lord of Israel will not
forsake them. Verse 18.
I will open rivers in the high places, and fountains in the midst of the
valley^s: I will make the wilderness a poole of water, and the dry land
springs of water.

Hear, O Lord, Psalm. 27.7, 8. Verse 9.
when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. Hide not
thy face far from me, put not thy servant away in anger: thou have been my
help, leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. Unto thee will
I cry, Psalm. 28.1, 2.
O Lord, my rock, be not silent to me, lest if thou be silent to me, I become
like them that go down into the pit. Hear the voice of my supplications,
when I cry unto thee: when I lift up my hands toward thy holy Oracle.
Withold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord; Psalm 40.11.
let thy loving kindness, and thy truth continually preserve me.

Hosea 2.20, 21, 22.
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou shall know the
Lord. And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, says the Lord, I
will hear the Heavens, and they shall hear the Earth, and the Earth shall
hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oil, and they shall hear Iezreel.

Psalm. 26.2, 3.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart: For thy loving
kindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.

and persecutions in the world. Hope of glory in due time to be revealed, and
of continual supply of all good th ngs from God in the mean space to be
freely given, will st^blish the heart with strong consolation, and cause in
outward p^ofession of Joy, to the glory of God, the encouragement of other
faithful people, and the amazement of the wicked. Heb. 10.34.
This is to be seen in the lives and deaths of Gods faithful servants, who
took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves that they had
in Heaven a better, and an enduring substance; who for this hope, endured the
cross, and despised shame, Heb. 12.2.
as is testified of our Savior himself. By faith, Moses when he was come to
years, refused to be called the son of Pharoahs daughter; choosing rather to
suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season: Heb. 11.24, 25, 26.
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Egypt:
for he had respect unto the recompense of reward. Heb. 11.35.
By faith others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might
obtain a better resurrection.

The way or means to stir up faith in these promises, The means to stir
up faith in these promises.
is;

Woe is me, how I am fallen from that state of blessedness wherein I was
first created, into a most miserable and accursed condition? I have grievously
sinned, and God is highly provoked, the sentence of the Law is already gone
forth, I am shut up under wrath, and if I have my desert, I can expect nothing
but the terrible execution of fearful veng^ance denounced. Mortality as a
worm corrupts my body: ignorance and lust tyrannize in my soul: my
condition is exposed to a thousand vanities and wearisome courses; and through
fear of death the vpshot of evils, Heb. 2.15.
I am subject to bondage all my life. In my first estate I was made far above
all visible Creatures, and by free bounty lifted up to be the Favorite of
the most High God: but by wilful disobedience, I am fallen into Gods
displeasure, and lie prison^r under the revenging justice of the law. Nor is my
wretched condition worse then my carelessness to be delivered from it. The
brute beasts take it as a grievous thing to be ensnared and taken: but I have
delighted in bond^ge, and counted it a liberty to live a slave to Satan, and
to follow things and courses pleasing corrupt nature. Thou Lord of thine
infinite grace have proclaimed liberty, published peace, and made offer of a
better state and condition in Christ, then what I formerly lost in Adam: But I
preferred spiritual thraldom to libe tie, death to life, and chose rather to
follow the temptations of Satan, and to fulfill the lusts of the flesh, then to
come unto Christ that I might be saved. The men of this world are wise in their
generation to accept of earthly commodities when they be offered, and not to
put by the opportunity: but when the Lord has made promise of everlasting
life, if I would renounce the pleasures of sin, and foregoe the vanities of
this world, I have followed vanity and neglected mercy, I have despised the
great salvation, and walked in the paths of death and condemnation. O Lord, it
is thine own work of grace in me, that ever I did bethink my self of the
danger of my course, and repent to lay hold upon the promises of life. Nor has
my sloth and negligence to seek evidence, get assurance, and enter possession
of that glorious inheritance, by growing up in peace, joy, holiness and
sanctification, been less od^ous, then former carelessenesse. Since I have
been enlightened, and tasted of the heavenly gift, I have slighted the promises
of mercy, which should have been my continual meditation; I have neglected to
get and keep the holy spirit, holy in it self, making them holy in whom as
temples it dwells, the seal and earnest of the promised inheritance. Ah,
what a dwarf am I in holiness and sanctification? for these many years how
little have I gained? My spiritual sight is exceeding dim, my passions
boisterous, my heart unquiet, my thoughts evil, my nature corrupt. I am dull
to good, apt to sin, feeble and of no power to withstand temptations, shaken
with many fears touching my salvation, soon unsettled and removed from
steadfastness by any contrary opposition, farthest to seek for evidence and
assurance when I stand in greatest need. All this is come upon me through mine
own foolishness: because I have not acquainted my self with the promises of
grace, nourished the motions of the Spirit, carefully improued the gifts
received, endeavored after perfection, and labored to be sealed more and
more with the promised Spirit. What might I have grown unto in Christ, if I
had instantly desired the Spirit of Grace of him who gives it, heeded the
inspirations and suggestions of it, and by all conscionable means? sought
increase of grace, and assurance of salvation? Long ere now I might have
attained fullness of spiritual wisdom and understanding, strength of faith,
power of grace, sweet communion and fellowship with God, liberty and freedom
to walk with God, comfortable possession in part, and good assurance of
eternal life in due time to be accomplished: whereas by reason of sloth and
negligence the powers of grace are so enfeebled, that I can scarce breathe,
sigh, crawle in the way to Heaven, my heart is desolate, I am a stranger to the
comforts of godliness, terrified with the remembrance of death, ready to
faint at the apprehension of trouble and danger, and continually disquieted
with fears and doubts touching mine own salvation, if the world with the
things thereof have not cast me into the sleep of security for a season. The
slothful man is justly condemned, who had rather starve in Summer for lack of
bread, then plough in winter because of the cold: We censure him that had
rather go lame and crooked as long as he lives, then be at a little pain to
move an aching joint. He is worthily accounted improuident, who neglecting to
gather in his writings, or sue out fine and recovery, will h^zard the loss of
his whole inheritance. My folly has exceeded herein, who to live in peace and
quiet with sin, have impouerished my soul, in^paired my stock of grace,
wounded my conscience, deprived my self of many rich privileges of grace,
which I might have enjoyed, weakened my title to mine everlasting inheritance,
and been contented to creep feebly toward the heavenly Canaan; thinking it
better to keep where I was with quiet, then to make my condition, by still
dealing with my self too too restless. The sluggards shameless excuse has
fearfully bewitched me; Better is an handful with ease, Eccles. 4.6.
then both hands full with travel and vexation of Spirit. The more excellent
the inheritance I hope for is, the more detestable is my sluggishnes and folly,
that I have not earnestly sought to make it sure unto my self, and entered
possession thereof so far as in this life is given of grace.

Awake, my soul, why sleep thou; arise, and lay hold upon the promises of
life, which God of his great mercy in Jesus Christ does offer unto thee in the
Gospel. Be not dismayed by reason of thine unworthiness, for the promise is
of grace, freely offered, and freely given to them that be most unworthy in
their own eyes. Thou art unworthy of the least crumme of mercy, but of his
rich mercy God has made promise of highest advancement unto thee, 2. Cor.
6.18.
if thou will embrace it. I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my
sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty. He that overcomes shall
inherit all things, And I will be his God, and he shall be my son. Apoc.
21.7. Romans 9.26.
And it shall be in the place where it was said unto them, ye are not my
people, that there they shall be called the children of the living God. Life
eternal is given of grace, not sold for works; received by faith, not
purchased by desert: and the more worthless thou art in thy own lowly
conceit, the more shall the grace of God be magnified in thine exaltation.
Christ has purchased righteousness and everlasting life: believe in him, and
live for ever. The Son of God debased himself to become the Son of Man, Gal
4 4, 5. Phil. 2.7, 8.
and to be made under the law, that he might redeem us that were under the
Law; that we might receive the Adoption of sons. Oh the bountifulness and
love of God to man, Titus 3 4.
by so great a price to purchase so high a dignity, that we should be called
the Sons of God, and be pertakers with Christ of all his glory in his
Fathers kingdom. O my soul, why art thou so dull and sluggish? Wherefore do
thou not put forth thy self to embrace and receive such an inestimable
benefit. If the worth of things may be measured by their price, well then may
the Sonship of true Belieuers be valued at the highest rate. Who can
sufficiently admire the dignity of this estate (to be the Son of God) which
could not be procured save only by this infinite price, the making of him
become nothing, by whom God in the beginning made every thing? It is esteemed a
matter of great honor to be the servant of the Prince in some special place
of eminency in the Commonwealth: How do men seek and sue for such Offices?
how do they rejoice when their desires are accomplished? But there is no
comparison betwixt the servant of a Prince, and the Son of God; the favor of
a Prince, and the Fatherly love of God; the dignity of the Court, and the
Joys of Heaven; a temporal office, and an eternal inheritance. It is better
and more honorable to be the servant of God, then the Commander of men; to be
an heir apparent to Heaven, then the possessor of the whole World. There is a
great opinion, and not without just cause, of the estate of our first Parents,
Adam and Eve, whilst they were in Paradise, before their fall. But their
estate, notwithstanding all their privileges, ornaments and favors, exceeded
not the condition of servants. Had they continued in obedience to their
Creator, they should have been exempted from all misery, and confirmed in
perfect blessedness: But they could never have attained this dignity. To be
made the Sons of God by Adoption, of mere, rich, and undeserved love in
Christ. And is it not an admirable prerogative, to be brought by Christ into a
more excellent state, then that which Adam in his innocence and glory had
just cause to wonder at. The low degree from which we are raised, does commend
this, and as the gratiousnesse of him who prefers, so the excellency of
that state whereunto the Belieuer is exalted. Of the servants of sin, to be
made the Sons of God; of the vassals of Satan, to be taken to reign with
Christ in glory for evermore; of children of wrath, dead in trespasses, to be
begotten again to the hope of an inheritance, immortal, undefiled, that
fades not; what an unspeakable favor is this? O my soul arise, stir up thy
self steadfastly to receive the promise of life; and hold it fast: for Gods
promises are certain, never less, but rather more in accomplishment then in
tender. Enter possession, and get the inheritance sealed unto thee. Would not a
poor Beggar, if he should understand of some great and goodly inheritance
bequeathed unto him in a far country, much rejoice therein, long to go see
it, and take possession of it. In matters of weight men love great earnest and
good assurance: for great advantage they will endure any pains, hazard many
difficulties. Did men know the worth and glory of the kingdom of Heaven,
freely offered, and that without all expiration of time, to be possessed here
in part of them that will receive it, fully hereafter, when their days on
earth be determined, would they not seek it with all earnestness, inquire
after good evidence, get sound assurance, and labor the possession of it more
and more? Men seek earthly things, and often miss of their desires: but the
promise of Heaven is sure and steadfast, and he that rests upon the Lord
shall not be confounded. Everlasting life is freely offered, but men are not
left at liberty whether they will receive and seek it, or no. John 3.36.
He that belieueth on the Son, has everlasting life: and he that belieueth
not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him. Do not
they perish worthily, who prefer the pleasures of sin, and honors of this
transitory life, before life everlasting, promised of grace, purchased by
Christ, full laden with all fruits of true life, joy, peace, and all choicest
pleasures, beyond comparison exceeding whatsoever can be enjoyed in this world
both in worth and endless settlednesse? The labor to make Heaven sure, which
is full of pleasure and delight, does ease the heart of many burdensome,
distracting and cutting care. For if thou be the child of God, Ephesians. 2.18.
and 3.12.
thou have liberty to come into his presence, and to make thy requests known
unto him with thanksgiving; Nothing that is truly evil shall betide thee. The
plague shall not come nigh thy Tabernacle: Psalm. 91.10.13.
Thou shall walk upon the Lion and Aspe, and tread them under feet: God will
provide all things necessary for soul and body, and see that no good thing be
wanting unto thee. Psalm. 34.10. Math. 6.33.
Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things
shall be added unto you. What then should withdraw or hold me back from
believing the promise, and seeking the possession of that inheritance. It is
God who has freely p^omised it, who can and will perform whatsoever he has
spoken; it is Christ who has purchased it by the sacrifice of himself once
for all, why then should I doubt? I am commanded to believe, and believing the
possession of life is g^uen in part, which may be increased by a daily
addition to the graces and comforts of the Adopted; why should I be negligent
to seek it confirmed and sealed? Everlasting life is the only true life, full
of joy, peace and contentation; a durable treasure which can never fade, a
crown that never withers: and shall base things take up the heart, when God
calls to seek a most glorious and everlasting inheritance? Oh, the
inestimable love and favor of God, who makes offer of an Adoption and
immortal Inheritance to the most contemptible wretches, that live upon the
face of the earth? The man that toiles hard all day long for a small piece of
silver, or lies at the rich man's gate waiting for an Alms, the scraps that
come from his Table: he is invited to come unto Christ, that he might obtain
a kingdom, an eternal kingdom that has none end, an inheritance abundantly
glorious; surpassing the glory and worth of all earthly treasures and
inheritances laid together, much more then all earthly treasures do exceed the
worth of one pin. What an heart-break is it to a man, when he finds that by
some default he has forfeited some earthly matters, which he might have held,
had he bin wary? but what grief and confusion will this cause, when he shall
see that through folly, sloth, carelessenesse, matchless cruelty and
unthankfulness, he has lost an everlasting inheritance of glory, which he
might have obtained? Mere possibility of co^passing some great and
extraordinary good is of more weight in swaying men's actions and inciting
endeavors, then certainty of accomplishing petty desires. But certainty and
commodity do here concur in one. There is no good to the possession of
eternal life: no success certain but this, that he who unfeignedly belieueth
in Christ, shall inherit the crown of glory. It is good for me to draw nigh unto
God, and put my trust in his mercy; to lay fast hold upon the promises of life
and protection, to get the spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father, and
fly unto his grace in Christ, to get my title made sure and strengthened unto my
conscience, and while time serves, earnestly to seek the kingdom of God.

Thirdly, We must pray earnestly that God would increase our faith, seal us
by his Spirit, lead us in the way of peace, cause us to grow up in holiness,
make us wise to prize and value, to taste and relish the joys of Heaven, and
assure our consciences of right and title to that everlasting inheritance. For
it is God that seals us, and makes us to read the sealing; that promises
Heaven, and affects the heart with the goodness and worth of the thing
promised; that by the pledges of his favor and the earnest of his Spirit does
sufficiently testify our Adoption, and cause us certainly to apprehend what
he does testify and assure. As the beginn^ng, so the progress, comfort and
assurance of life is from him, and instantly is to be begged of him. Faith
receives the promise of life, and gives assurance of what is received, as it
prays. Who am I O Lord, that thou should make such ample and free promises
unto thy poor servant concerning his everlasting happiness? Of thy free
mercy, and according to thine own heart, have thou spoken all these great
things, to make thy servant know them. And now, O Lord God, establish I beseech
thee the word that thou have spoken concerning thy servant graciously accept me
for thy child by the earnest of thy Spirit and pledges of thy favor, seal
unto me the promised inheritance, and make me assuredly to know what great
things thou have done, and what those hopes be which are reserved for me in
Heaven. My sight is dim, not proportioned and fitted to so high an object, my
affections carnal that I cannot set my self to purpose about this
contemplation, the Devil labors nothing more then to keep me hood-winked
this way O Lord, I beseech thee enable me to know this good and blessed hope,
the matter of mine inheritence abundantly glorious, that my heart may be still
in Heaven, and by thy Spirit lead me into all truth and holiness, 1 Thessalonians.
2.12. 2 Thessalonians. 1.12.14
that in due time I may possess the Kingdom of glory whereunto I am called.
Col. 1.5.
Of thy free grace thou have called me by the Gospel to this blessed hope,
which is laid up for me in Heaven: therefore is thy servant bold to entreat
the sense of thy love, the knowledge of this Hope, the increase of grace, and
assurace of thy mercy for evermore.

Was it ever found that any man of rank or place did adopt the blind, lame,
deaf, dumb, or otherwise deformed to be heir, to succeed him in his
inheritance? My soul, rejoice thou in the Lord, and bless his holy Name, for
he has looked upon my base estate, and visited me with mercy from on high: Of
a stranger and forreiner, I am made a free denizon of the new Jerusalem: of the
bondslaue of Satan, the friend of Christ, of the child of wrath and damnation,
the son of God and heir of salvation. My Name is registered in Heaven, an
eternal weight of glory is reserved which the most righteous God has
promised, and in fittest season will give unto me. Why should I doat on
earthly braueries, who have an eternal life that has most excellent glory,
honor, riches and happiness, above all the heart can comprehend, joined with
it, prepared and given through faith in Christ. It were notable baseness, if an
heir of sumptious and stately palaces should covet the poor cotages of
beggars that stand by the high way side. Psalm. 16.5.6.
The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou maintainest
my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea I have a goodly
heritage. My study and care should be to know my heavenly hopes better and
more fully, that I might weane my self the more willingly from all earthly
vanities. Heaven is my home, my hope, mine inheritance: and where should my
heart be, but where my treasure is, where my thoughts, but where my hope is? In
this life I receive only the first fruits of the Spirit, the earnest of the
inheritance: but I will wait patiently for the full possession thereof, and
walk charefully in the way that leads thereunto. In earthly things men are
contented to wait for a good lease in reuersion, and to lay out their money
for that which shall not come to their hands till some lives be expired: and
should not I wait for the accomplishment of glory there being but one life
betwixt it and me, and that is mine own.

CHAP. V.
What it is live by faith touching the promises of of perseverance, and how to
stir up our selves thereunto.

GOd of his infinite mercy has made further promises, (the necessity of his
servants so requiring, God has made many promises of perseverance.
) that his mercy shall never depart from them, that he will confirm and
strengthen them to the end, notwithstanding their own weakness, and the
malice of their spiritual enemies, and that nothing shall separate them from
the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. Genesis 3.15.
This is implied in the first promise which God made, It shall bruise thy head
and thou shall bruise his heel: where Satan is stinted to the heel of the
true Christian seed. In many passages of Scripture the same is most clearly
and manifestly expressed. Psalm. 1.3. Psalm. 92.13, 14.
He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth
his fruit in his season, his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he
does shall prosper. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he
delights in his way. Though he fall, Psalm. 37.23.24
he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord vpholdeth him with his hand.
For this God is our God for ever and ever, Psalm. 48.14. Psalm. 73.24. Verse. 26.
he will be our guide even unto death. Thou shall guide me with thy council,
and afterward receive me to glory. My flesh and heart fails: but God is the
strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. The mercy of the Lord is from
everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him. Psalm. 103.17.
A good man shows favor and lends: Psalm. 112.5.6.
he will guide his affairs with discretion: Surely he shall not be moved for
ever: Psalm. 125.1.2.
the righteous shall be in eu^rlasting remembrance. They that trust in the
Lord, shall be as mount Zion, Esaias 42.3.
which cannot be removed, but abides for ever. A bruised reed shall he not
break, and the smoking staxe shall he not quench. Esaias 46.4.
And even to your old age I am he; and even to the hoare hairs will I carry
you; Esaias 54.10.
I have made, and I will bear, even I will carry, and will deliver you. For
the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall
not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, Esaias
59.21.
says the Lord that has mercy on thee. As for me, this is my covenant with
them, says the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have
put in thy mouth, Romans 9.8. Gal. 4.28.
shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, that is,
such as be effectually called according to the purpose of God. Hereunto may be
added those passages which testify, that the love which God bears to his
people is an everlasting love, and the covenant which he has made with them
effectually and shall be kept assuredly, is an everlasting covenant. Ier. 31.3
The Lord has appeared of old unto me, saying, yea, I have loved thee with an
everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee. In a
little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment: but with everlasting
kindness will I have mercy on thee, Esaias 54.8.9.
says the Lord thy Redeemer. For this is as the waters of Noah unto me for as
I have sworn, that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so
have I sworn, that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. Behold,
the days come says the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the house
of Israel and with the house of Judah: Ier. 31.31.32.33. Heb. 8.8.9. and 10
16.17.
Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the day that I
took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which my
covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them. But this shall be
the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days,
says the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their
hearts. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. And I will give
them one heart, Ier. 32.38.39.40
and one way, that they may fear me for ever, Heb. 13.20.
for the good of them, and of their children after them. And I will make an
everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do
them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart
from me. Heb. 8.10.
In which covenant or Testament God freely promises to give what he requires
of his people, and to effect in them what he calls for at their hands. If the
benefits given be compared amongst themselves, one is as it were a condition to
another: but they be all effects in respect of the grace and free favor of God
certainly conferring them upon whom he will. Righteousness and life are
promised upon condition of faith: but the condition of the covenant is promised
in the covenant it self. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit
will I put within you, Ezekiel 36.26, 27
and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh. And I will put my
Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep
my judgments, Hos. 2.19.20.
and do them. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea I will betroth
thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and
in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou shall
know the Lord. The external betrothing by outward covenant, so as God
betrothes himself to all professing the true faith, Romans 9.24, 25. 1. Pet.
2.8, 9, 10 Math. 7.24, 25.
may be broken, for though God offer them mercy if they will believe, yet he
gives not faith to them, but the internal by effectual disposition, of which
the Prophet speaks in this place, is indissoluble. Whosoever hears these
sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built
his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the
winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon
a rock. But all the faithful are built upon the rock, not upon the rock
now, and anon upon the sand, Math. 16.18.
but once built upon the rock, they remain immovable. Thou art Peter, and
upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not
prevail against it: assail it they may, prevail against it they shall not.
John 10.27, 28, 29. Ezekiel. 34.15, 16.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, And I give unto
them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of my hand: My Father which gave them me, is greater then all: and no
man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand. Who shall separate us from
the love of Christ? Shall tribulation; or distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Romans 8.35, 37. Romans 11 29.
Nay, in all these things we are more then conquerours through him that loved
us. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Blessed be the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy, has
begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
the dead. To an inheritance incorruptible, 1. Pet. 1.3, 4, 5.
and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in Heaven for you. Who are
kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in
the last time. 1. John 3.2.
Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we
shall be: but we know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for
we shall see him as he is. Jude ^.24, 25.
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
faultlesse before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy: To the only
wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, now and ever,
Amen. Does God in these places promise to protect us against foreign enemies,
not against domesticke perfidiousnesse? The texts do respect no condition, as
the cause of fulfilling these promises, but plainly affirm, that God himself
does promise and will give the condition which he requires. For to what end
does he write the Law in the heart, uphold with his hand, and give a good issue
to the temptation, but that the will, prone to wickedness, should not yield,
and altogether start back from grace received? Whosoever is borne of God, 1.
John 3.9. 1. John 5.18.
does not commit sin: for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin,
because he is borne of God. And if the seed abide in the faithful as an
indeleble character and pledge of their inheritance, that they cannot sin in
the Apostles sense, then are they fenced against the treachery of their own
hearts remaining in them. John 4.14. and 7.38, 39.
Whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst: but
the water that I give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
everlasting life: where thirst is opposed to a total want of grace, not to the
earnest desire of increase in grace. The thirst of total indigencie is taken
away by the participation of grace, 1 Pet. 2.2, 3.
the thirst of complacencie or more ample fruition of grace, is increased. The
Holy Spirit who is sent into the hearts of the Sons of God, is not there as a
guest to tarry for a night or two: but as an inhabitant to dwell and remain
for ever: yea, as an earnest of their inheritance, Romans 8.11. Hag. 2.5. 1. Pet.
4.14. 1. John 2.27 John 14.16.
until the redemption of the purchased possession. I will pray the Father, and
he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. Now
he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is, God, who
has also sealed us, 2. Cer. 1.21.21 Ephesians. 1.14. and 4.30.
and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts: which is the earnest of our
inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise
of his glory. 1. Pet. 1.23.
The seed whereof the faithful are begotten is incorruptible, the life which
they live by faith in Christ is an everlasting life. John 5.24. John 17.3. John
6.47.
Verily, verily I say unto you, He that hears my word, and belieueth on him
that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but
is passed from death unto life. And this is the record, that God has given to
us eternal life, 1. John 5.11.12.
and this life is in his Son. He that has the Son has life, and he that
has not the son has not life. Now the Scripture saying, He that belieueth
has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, does import that
faith and the fruits thereof be such from which the godly through the power of
God never fall. Luk 22.32. John 17.15.
And for further confirmation the Scripture testifyeth, that Christ has prayed
for his people that their faith should not fail, that they should be kept from
the evil. This cannot be restrained to the Apostles, Verse. 20.
but it is the common privilege of all the faithful; Neither pray I for these
alone; but for all them also which shall believe on me through their word. And
the intercession of Christ; even for this particular blessing of the not
failing of faith, never cease, is ever effectual, and speedeth always. And
that nothing might be wanting to full consolation in this point, we are
assured from God, that he will perfect the the work of grace which he has
begun. 1. Cor. 1.8.
Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameles in the day
of our Lod Jesus Christ. Being confident of this very thing, Phil. 1.6.
that he which has begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day
of Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calls you, 1 Thessalonians. 5.24.
who also will do it, that is, (as goes immediately before) preserve your
whole Spirit, and soul and body blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ. 2 Thessalonians. 3 3.
The Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.

Now seeing God has bin pleased by so many promises to assure the faithful of
their sure and steadfast estate, By serious meditation on these pr^mises we
must settle our selves in believing, which is very necessary.
it is necessary seriously to learn and think upon them, that they might be
settled in believing their perseverance. Had it not been a point of great
weight and necessity, we cannot think the Lord would have mentioned it so
often, and confirmed it so many ways: which will soon appear to any man that
shall consider his own frailty, and the strength and malice of his spiritual
enemies; how potent and vigilant they be to assail, how weak and feeble he
is to withstand and make resistance. Nor is our weakness greater then our
backwardness to believe the promises of perseverance, when we stand in most
need of them. When corruptions stir, and tentations be hot and fiery, and we
find our selves ready to f^int, then are we to seek of a promise that might
uphold against the fear of falling away; or if the promise be at hand, we
cannot lay hold upon it, some mist or other comes between it and the eye of
our understanding. Many good Christians are kept under with this temptation,
They are afraid they shall never hold out, if persecution should come, they stand
in doubt lest they should fall away as many have done, who made greater shows,
and seemed to have gone further then ever they did. And whilst they
distrustfully question their perseverance, all present favors seem less then
otherwise they would, all other promises be held the more weakly, and Satan
takes advantage to fill their hearts with manifold discomforts. God (I deny
not) does order these temptations to the best, and will do his children good by
them: for hereby they are driven to distrust themselves and run unto God, and
rely upon him in all their necessities: nevertheless the many perplexities
wherein they are entangled for want of faith in the promises of perseverance,
does sufficiently convince how necessary it is we should labor to have our
hearts established in this confidence, that the Lord will never leave us nor
forsake us. Confidence in the promises of perseverance does encourage and
quicken in a Christian course, stablish in well-doing, and hearten against the
greatest difficulties. Prevention of an objection.
Or old it has been objected against the doctrine of assurance, of not
falling away, that it does set open a door to all licentiousness: for if men
cannot fall from their estate of happiness why should they fear to commit all
kind of wickedness. But he that has faith in-deed, will not, nay, he cannot
take courage to go on in sin upon this pretense, that faith once had cannot
utterly be lost. The belieuer knows himself bound to the obedience of the
Gospel, though he be freed from the damnation of the law; and certain it is,
that faith which knits to Christ, does lead us forth in all holiness. Psalm.
130 4.
Mercy covering sin does beget reverence; the more assurance of salvation in
a man's soul, the more fear and trembling in a man's course. He who is best
assured has most power of Gods Spirit, and the stronger the Spirit of God is
within, the more holiness and fruits of grace without. Paul was assured that
nothing should separate him from the love of God in Christ: 1. Cor 9.27. 2.
Tim. 4.7, 8.
Peter was assured, that his faith should not fail: did this make them the
more careless? Nay, rather the more careful to run their race; the more
courageous to fight out their combat. 1. John 4.19.
The lodestone of love is love: Love in the superior does draw love from the
inferior: and is it then possible for us to apprehend such unspeakable love of
God in choosing us to such an excellent, happy, unchangeable condition, and not
be affected to love the Lord again? Of necessity the faith which continues
must be lively, nor can it embrace the promises of perseverance but whilst it
is lively. The more operative faith is, the greater our assurance of future
standing: if faith be dormant or languish for a time, for that time we are to
seek of this comfort, nor can it be recovered, till faith recover, and put
forth it self valiantly in combating against Satan, subduing corruption, and
working righteousness. Look how much we come short in believing the faithful
promises of God concerning our future protection from all hurtful evils, (the
greatest whereof is falling away) so much are we lacking to sound peace and
stable tranquillity of Mind and Conscience. The better we have learned to
live by faith in Christ, as the Author and finisher of our faith, and raiser
of us up at the last day, the greater and more steadfast is our comfort. The men
of this world be not satisfied with the possession of their purchased
inheritance, but they seek to strengthen and assure their title against future
claims, before they can be quiet. When a Christian is acquainted with the
promises of pardon and forgiveness, belieueth in Christ for salvation, and is
reconciled unto God; When his conscience is purged, that there remains no
more terrible remembrance of sins past, his lusts subdued and vanquished, his
heart quieted from all perturbations, and all inward disturbance, which was in
man against himself done away; and when these things are known unto the
Conscience: yet one thing is wanting to sound and full peace, that is, holy
security for time to come against all enemies both inward and outward, that
they shall not hunt us much less prevail against us. For if what we possess
may utterly be lost, or what we hope and expect be merely uncertain and
coniecturall, built upon the good use of our free will, and not upon the free
and unchangeable grace of God, what rest or quiet in respect of his future
estate can any man find in himself? But let the heart be established in this,
that God will carry him forward from grace to grace till he have brought him
to his everlasting Kingdom; that his faith shall never fail, the graces of
the Spirit shall never wither and decay. Satan with all his malice, the world
with the manifold allurements thereof shall never prevail against him; this
freeth from much heart-griefe, perplexity, distrustful sorrow, and
unprofitable trouble, when he feels his own weakness, thinks of Satan and
the worlds power, hears of the falls of some who have gone far in the
profession of godliness, and casts with himself what persecutions may be
raised against him for the truth and Gospel. This also refreshes the heart
with sweet and heavenly comfort in the midst of those many trials and
encumbrances which we do and must make account to meet with all: and this our
heavenly Father knew to be no more then necessary for our cheerful walking
before him. For the which cause I also suffer these things, 2. Tim. 1.12.
nevertheless, I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have beliued, and I am
persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against
that day.

The Godly are allowed to believe their perseverance.
And seeing God has promised to perfect the work of grace begun, and bound
himself by covenant to confirm, strengthen, and stablish his children unto
the end, and in the end to give them eternal life, such as find any true and
lively work of grace wrought in them, are allowed from God to believe, that
they shall never perish, nor quite be broken off from Christ, nor those living
waters clean be dried up, but notwithstanding their own infirmities, and the
sore temptations wherewith they are oppressed, they shall be preserved, vpheld
and kept unto salvation. For what God has confirmed by promise and covenant
unto his children, undertaken to effect by his Almighty power, and ratified by
earnest and pawn, that they are allowed to believe and expect from him of his
unchangeable grace and love. This is the golden and indissoluble chain which
the Apostle speaks of, Romans 8.30.
Whom he did predestinate, them also he called: and whom he called, them he
also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified: Luke 22.32.
Math. 6.13.
so that effectual vocation is a pledge and token of glorification to ensue.
Christ has prayed for his people, that their faith might not fail: the
faithful pray instantly, John 16.23.
Lead us not into temptation: and that no man might waver a promise is annexed,
Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you. But
without question, they have allowance to believe the obtaining of that which
Christ has prayed for, 1. John 5.14.
and the faithful ask of God in the Name of Christ according to his will. The
servants of Christ, who lived by the like precious faith with us, groun^ed upon
the same promises, and subject to the same temptations, Rom 8.38.39.
believed their perseverance. I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor
Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate from the
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Phil. 1.20.
According to mine earnest expectation, and my hope that in nothing I shall be
ashamed: but that with all boldness, as always so now, also Christ shall be
magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death. And the Lord shall
deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly
kingdom, 2. Tim. 3.18.
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. But what one believed upon common
and ordinary grounds, that is the privilege of all belieuers which they are
allowed to receive. It is a great glory to God that we live by faith on him
concerning our future estate, and rely upon his grace, that shall encounters
we shall be more then Conquerours, through him that loved us. For this is to
take God to be our God, not only to put our confidence in him in prosperity
and adversity, when we have means or means be wanting, for our souls and
bodies: but also to relic upon him, that he will make us walk in his
Commandments, and put his fear in our hearts, that we shall not depart from
him; that he will perfect his work begun in us, finish our fai h, and
preserve us unto his everlasting kingdom This faith does give unto God the
praisent all grace which he is pleased to bestow, and of all works of grace
which he effects by us. He that relieth upon the good use of his free will,
must necessarily ascribe the praise of his perseverance in part, if not
principally, unto himself: but he that rests upon the Lord for establishment
against all spiritual enemies, and ability unto every good work, he must
necessarily ascribe the whole praise unto the glory of Gods grace, upon which
he does depend. The acts of faith concerning perseverance.


The acts of says concerning perseverance be these and such like.

2. Cor. 3.5.
Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves:
but our sufficiency is of God. Naturally we trust in our selves, and are
p^esumptuous of our strength: but when by faith we go forth of our selves unto
God for help, we can see nothing in our selves but weakness and frailty.

I was afraid (says Job) of all my works; Job 9.28. Gatak. Spiritual Watch,
page 84.
knowing, that if I did wickedly, thou would not acquit me. And this
suspicion does beget care to shun occasions of sin, and watchfulness to
prevent spiritual distempers. A man jealous of his health is wary in his
diet: and he that has his soul in suspicion will ever be questioning with it
and watching over it least he should offend. This iealosie is ever waking, apt
to cast the worst that may fall out, but to counsel the best, that is, to
keep far from the occasions of sin, abstain from all appearance of evil,
and take heed of the snare in lawful businesses of this life. And surely, in
this kind considering our great frailty, it is more behoouefull for a man to
be somewhat too he die and cautelous, then to be a little too secure and self
confident: to be suspicious of his weakness that he may be enabled by God and
become strong in him, then while he is fool-hardie and strong in his own
conceit, to run into danger, and prove weak in trial.

Psalm. 17.5.
Faith instantly cries unto the Lord for help and strength and continual
supply of grace. Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
Psalm 119.8.
I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. Look thou upon me and be
merciful unto me: as thou use to do unto those that love thy Name. Order my
steps in thy word, Psalm. 119.32, 33. Cant. 1.4.
and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. Draw me, we will run after
thee. Show me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth,
Psalm. 25.4, 5.
and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation, on thee do I wait all
the day long. When men be conscious to themselves of their own wants, they are
wont to resort unto others by whom their wants may be supplied: The Belieuer is
empty in himself and sensible of his own weakness, desirous of supply and
confident of help in God, 2. Tim. 4.17. 2. Cor. 12.9, 10. 2. Cor. 4.7.
who alone is able to confirm and strengthen him, yea so to enable him
notwithstanding his infirmity, that his power and might shall appear in him
amidst his feebleness, and his very infirmity shall make much for his glory:
and therefore he will not cease day after day to repair unto him for
continual supply and strength of grace.

2. Pet. 2.2.
As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye may grow
thereby. If the body be healthful, and in case to grow in strength, there
will be an appetite to wholesome food and good digestion by the stomach; every
living thing has a faculty to draw nourishment unto it self: and the faith
which never fails does not only covet, but kindly digest the Word of life,
and suck nourishment from it, whereby it is made able and strong to every good
word and work: If the stomach decay, or the appetite be inordinate after
things hurtful and unwholesome food, or the digestion ill, that meat taken in,
passes away not altered by the stomach, the natural life is in danger, so
the life of grace languisheth, when our appetite to the word decays, we
affect earthly things immoderately, delight in a frothy, windy, vain sound of
words, which pleases the ea^e, but edifieth not the conscience, or if we hear
slightly, but take not pains to feed substantially upon the Word. I deny
not, but a lively neuer-fading faith is subject to these and more grievous
distempers for a time, but in this languishing fit, though it be not unto
death, until it recover, it is unable to embrace the promises of perseverance:
and the more lively it is to receive those promises, the more earnestly does it
desire and sweetly feed upon the Word of grace.

Fifthly, It puts forth it self to perform all duties of holiness and love
with life and fe^uour: It labors and takes pains in well-doing. For
Idleness corrupts natural strength; use and exercise confirms it. Dull and
sluggish actions argue feeblenes of the faculty and tend unto decay; as if we
do not things with that vigor we have done, it is a sign of infirmity, and of
a faculty inwardly or outwardly hindered; and if we rest in such a
perfunctorie course and challenge not our selves for it, we are in danger to
grow worse and worse. But liveliness and contention in doing is both an
argument of good disposition, and a means of increase. The more lively faith
is, the better it works: and the more it works, the faster it grows. Life
is the daily and continual v^gour of a living substance: and every thing as it
is most lively and likely to continue, the more it does show forth it strength
in working. For a time faith may fall asleep, and the actions of faith be
heartlesse, dull and perfunctorie: but faith now asleep will awake anon,
sh^ke up it self, stir up affections, resist sloth, blow up devotion, and
restlessely aspire after heavenly things. And like as it is with them, whose
going back helps them to take their rise and fetch their leap more
commodiously, or whose linking for a season makes them to ply their business
the closer afterward: So here, faith (through him that is the Author and
finisher of it) after such remissness does renew it endeavors, and with more
vigor and holy contention set upon the works of piety and godliness, stir
up the graces of the Spirit, tie up the thoughts to heavenly things, labor
against wind and tide, and walk before God in all wel-pleasing, though not
without great weakness.

Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, Ier. 17.14. Psalm. 41.4.
and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise Lord be merciful unto me,
heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee. How are men affected in
recovering bodily health, somewhat better will not content or satisfy? When
they can sit up, but not able to walk up and down the chamber, oh that they
had a little strength to stir: when they dare walk within doors, oh that
they could stir abroad, then that their stomach were returned, and they
could walk in their accustomed strength. Every living thing the more it does
live, the more it coueteth perfection of life in it kind. And so is faith
affected in receiving spiritual strength from the sickness of sin, till it
feel it self enlarged to walk constantly and cheerfully before the Lord,
yea, till it be perfectly recovered, which cannot be so long as we carry about
us this body of death. By reason man excels the beasts, by holiness he
excels himself, inferior only to the Angels in degree, and made like unto
the Lord, as far as a creature may be to his Creator: Sin is the sickness
of the soul, so much more loathsome and dangerous then distempers of the body,
as the soul is more excellent then the body: Holiness is the health,
ornament and excellency of the soul, as far surpassing it in worth, as man
does the basest creature in dignity and honor. There is no trouble, shame,
and sorrow to sin: there is no honor and comfort to holiness and
sanctification. According to the nature of holiness, so is the fruit; Prou.
3.14, 15.
the merchandise thereof is better then the merchandise of silver, and the
gain thereof then fine gold; It is more precious then rubies, and whatsoever
can be desired without, it is not to be compared unto it. The natural man
negl^cteth to seek after holiness or take pains to get it, because he feels
not the sickness of his soul, nor understands the worth and fruit of grace:
But the true Belieuer, who is grieved with his infirmities, and knows the
excellency and comfort of spiritual health, cannot but desire and covet grace
more and more, that in due time he might be perfectly healed.

Seventhly, It receives new supply of grace continually from Jesus Christ the
fountain of grace. John 1.16.
Of his fullness have we all received, and grace for grace: Christ is an
euer-flowing fountain of grace, of whose plenty all Belieuers are abundantly
pertakers, and that from one degree of grace to another, though not all in the
same measure and degree. Water in a ditch, which has no living spring to feed
it, is soon dried up: but the pond which is nourished continually with fresh
springs, does not fea^e the drought of Summer, or scorching heat of the Sun.
The Temporary, who was never knit unto Christ, as a living natural and proper
member, may fall away from that which he seemed to have; But the true Belieuer,
in whom Christ, the fountain of life dwells, who daily receives grace from
him, Ephesians 3.17. Ephesians. 4.7.
according to the measure of the gift of Christ, he shall never utterly be
destitute. He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me and
I in him. John 6.56, 57.
As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats
me, even he shall live by me.

Ezekiel. 36.27. Ier. 32.40.
I will make you to walk in my Commandments; I will put my fear in your
heart, that you shall not d part. John 6.54.
Who so eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life, and I will
raise him up at the last day. But Faith gives assurance of perseverance as it
does of the pardon and forgiveness of sins, and what is necessary to be
known of that point, has been largely handled before.

Now if a Christian would stir up his faith to believe the promses of
perseverance, Means to stir up our selves to believe these promises of
perseverance.
when he feels his own weakness, and considers the strength and malice of
his Adversaries.

Woe is me, poor wretch, blind, lame, crooked, sick, impotent, unstable as
the running water: How was I bewitched with selfe-confidence and conceit of
spiritual fullness? I have presumed upon my wisdom, as sufficient to direct
my ways, and leaned upon my strength, as able to make resistance against
temptations, stand upon mine own bottom, and go through stich with my
resolutions: But now I find my wisdom is ignorance, vanity and folly, my
strength weakness: I am unable to think one good thought, set one step
forward toward Heaven, keep my standing, or withstand the least assault. In
pain I am pettish, under crosses faint, heartlesse, discontent, ready to fly
at the sound of persecution, secure in prosperity, puffed up with comforts,
apt to be led away with worldly allurements. My spiritual taste is
distempered with carnal vanities, which relish sweeter to me then the mercies
of God in Christ; mine appetite to the Word and food of life is abated, my
zeal decayed, mine affections dull to good, my devotion cooled, my conscience
benumbed. I hear, but feed not upon the Word, my Prayers are cold, heartlesse,
rouing; in earthly employments I keep no moderation, daily weaknesses and
lesser sins go down without reluctation: the motions of the spirit quickly
die, the motions of the flesh live and get strength, admonition is fruitless,
reproof unwelcome in my course I am ready to stumble at every rub, linger
after every bait laid by Satan or the world to catch me, and totter upon the
smallest tentation. Every day I have greater experience of my weakness then
other; soon distempered and put out of frame, if by any means for a little
time my heart be brought into some better order, I am forgetful of my
purposes, negligent of the opportunities to get good, distracted with lawful
business and weary of the wo^kes of my calling, perplexed at the troubles I
meet with, giving way to forwardness, not looking up to God: unthankful for
mercies, trifling out the the time in foolish surmises, vain ploddings, and
unprofitable speeches. The poor, lean, thin fruits of grace, which through
the mercy of God now and then I epsy in my self, these proclaim my sick
and feeble state: my thoughts and meditations of good poor and few; striuings
against sin weak, appetite to the wholesome food of life small, digestion slow,
obedience m^ruellous defective and in a manner liuelesse. I live under the
powerful means of grace, enjoy many helps in private, am free from many great
tentations wherewith others are exercised in respect of their outward
condition, blessed with the society of them that fear God, pruned and dressed
by my heavenly Father, and yet I reele, waver, am tossed too and fro, and ready
to fall upon every occasion. Ah, wretched man that I am, how shall I be able
to stand if the means should fail, persecucutions be raised, or the powers
of Hell let loose upon me.

I am sick, but God is my physician; weak, but God is my rock, my strength,
my high tower; I like a lost sheep am ready to go astray, but the Lord is my
Shepherd, and will not suffer me to perish. Christ's intercession is ever
effectual: but he has prayed that my faith should not fail, and promised
that the gates of hell shall not prevail. The sons of Adam mortal by birth,
can never grow beyond the state of mortality: the children of God borne of
immortal seed can never fall from the state of immortality. True faith is a
never fading faith, the life of grace an everlasting life, the water of life, a
well springing unto eternal life. Christ once died for sin, never to die any
more: and he that lives in Christ shall live for ever. Indeed if faith were
the work of freewill or had dependence upon it, it might well perish, but
being the entire gift of God according to his purpose of grace, it must needs
partake of the unchangeable love of God, which is the fountain whence it
springs. I will walk jealous of my self, because feeble and apt to offend,
but confident in Gods mercy and grace, because he is faithful, who shall
confirm me unto the end, and perfect his work he has begun. My care shall
be to feed upon the word of life, to shun sin and the occasions leading
thereunto, to cry for aid and strength and when I feel my self ready to
sink, I will hang upon the Lord, for his power shall sustain me, his right
hand shall uphold me, and by his might I shall be keept through faith unto
salvation. A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
quench, Math. 12.20. 2. Cor. 12.9.
till he send forth judgment into victory: his power shall be magnified in
my weakness.

God, so it is of God that they know their standing. O Lord God of heaven, the
great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that rest upon
thy gracious promise and desire to yield up themselves in obedience to thy
Commandments, loooke mercifully upon me, thy weak unworthy servant: heal
mine infirmities, for they are many, and stablish me by thy free Spirit for I
am brought very low. Remember, I beseech thee, Ier. 32.39, 40.
the word of thy co^e^ant, saying, I will give them one heart and one way that
they may fear me for ever for the good of them, and of their children after
them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that
they shall not depart from me. Now I am thy poor creature, the wo^ke of thine
hands whom thou have made; thy poor servant with whom thou have stricken
covenant, unto whom thou have showed this mercy, that I desire to fear thy
Name: O Lord, I beseech thee, teach me thy way, make me to walk in thy truth,
unite my heart to thy fear, confirm, strengthen, stablish me unto the end,
and make me to know that by thy power I shall be enabled to stand fast and
vanish the enemies of my salvation, that I may fight manfully, obey
cheerfully, persist undaunted, and rejoice in thy salvation all the days of
my life.

CHAP. VI.
How to live by faith in time of Temptation, when Satan encounters and seeks
to winnow the poor servants of Christ.

NO sooner does a Christian set himself unfeignedly to seek the Lord, 1. Pet.
5.8.
but Satan with all his malice subteltie might and fury does make out after
him, assaying by inward suggestions and outward tentations aga^ne and again
reiterated to discourage, turn back, and utterly over throw him. The
servants, of Christ are all soldiers, and have continual war not with flesh
and blood, Ephesians. 6.11.12.
but with principalities and powers, and spiritual wickednesses. This they
must expect, they have sworn it, and are called unto of the Lord;
Encouragements to resist Satan.
who for their encouragement does not only acquaint them with the necessity
of the fight, the justness of their cause, the weight of the business, Apo.
2.11.26.27. Apo 3.21. Iam. 1.12. Promises of victory. Genesis 3.13.
the honor of the combat, the reward of victory if they overcome, that he
himself does behold and approve the valiant, but also by his faithful prom^se
does assure them of strength and victory. This is signified in the first
promise. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel: which
properly being understood of Christ, by communication of grace does belong to
all the faithful. Simon, Simon, behold Satan has desired to have you, that
he might sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, Luke 22.31.32.
that thy faith fail not. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, Ephesians.
6.15.
that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to
stand. Resist the Devil, Iam. 4 7.
and he will slay from you. He that is begotten of God keeps himself, and
that wicked one touches him not. 1. Ioh. 5.18. Math. 16.18.
The gates of hell shall not prevail against it. For I am persuaded, that
neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, Romans
8.38.39.
nor things present, nor things to come. Nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord. Satan was the strong man armed who possessed all in peace: Luk
11.21.
but our Savior has overcome him, taken from him all his armor, Col. 2.15.
and divided his spoils. Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a
show of them openly, triumphing over them upon the Cross; and so through death
has destroyed him that had the power of death, Heb. 2.14.15.
that is, the Devil, that he might deliver all them which for fear of death
were all their life subject to bondage. Ephesians. 4.8.
Wherefore he says, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive.

The godly are allowed to believe the promises of victory. Romans 16.20.
In this state of temptation the servants of God are allowed to live by faith.
For the God of peace has promised to tread Satan under our feet shortly,
opportunely. When Satan may seem to prevail and get the victory, God will
speedily bruise and crush him under the feet of the faithful, least he
should hurt or overthrow their salvation. The craft of Satan is great to
deceive, but God will teach wisdom and providence to discern and disappoint
his stratagens. 2. Cor. 12.7.8.9. Romans 6.14.
The power of Satan is great to molest, but if we fight manfully against him,
not trusting in our own strength, but in the living Lord, we shall obtain a
joyful victory. We must not be slothful nor selfe-confident, but valiant in
the Lord, and the success is certain through his blessed aid. Through God
we shall do valiantly: Psalm. 60.12.
for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. This is the commandment of
God, 1. Ioh. 3.23.
that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. Nothing is so glorious
to God: nothing so profitable to us. John 3.33.
It does give God, as it were, a testimonial of his truth, power, mercy and
goodness. And for our selves, Iam. 2.5. Esaias 30.15.
it is our treasure, strength and victory. God has chosen the poor of this
world, rich in faith. In quietness, and in confidence shall be your strength.
We have a charge to resist the Devil strong in the faith. 1. Pet. 5.9.
The more fiercely we be assailed, the more confidently should we betake our
selves unto the Lord for help, who is our strong castle, and rock of defense.
In peace if men let their armor hang by and rust, yet it is time to buckle it
about them, when the enemy is at the gates, and begins to batter the walls.
The Lord permits Satan to buffet us, that we might be moved to seek and take
unto us the armor of a Christian, more especially to put on the shield of
faith. To doubt and fear because we are exercised in spiritual combats, is as
if a soldier should lay aside his harness, because he is called forth to
battle with his enemies. The Apostle speaking of our spiritual conflict with
the malicious enemies of our souls, charge us not only to believe, but above
all things to labor after faith. Above all things taking the shield of faith:
Ephesians. 6 16.
which manner of exhorting does show us, both what care we must have of it, and
what approbation we have from God to believe. For if we bid a servant buy many
things, but above all such a thing by his charge he might easily gather what he
should be careful in, and what allowance he had to do it. So when we are
counseled above all things to get faith, it is not hard to understand, that we
must be chiefly careful about it, and that God is well pleased we should so
be. Faith is one of the first things that is formed in a Christian, and
wherewith God furnishes him, when he prepares and calls him forth to the
encounter: so that to question whether we should believe, is to question
whether we should dedicate our selves to the service of God, deny our lusts,
or fight against the Devil. That which is fabulously spoken of the Giants is
truly spoken of us; we are no sooner borne, then we have our swords girded
to us, our shields on our arms. The Lord stands betwixt his children and all
dangers that are intended against them by their malicious enemies. He is ever
at their right hand to save their souls from death. And if God stand forth for
their help, they cannot better provide for their one ease and safety, then if
they confidently hope in the Lord, and repose their souls upon his might.

It is necessary a Christian should live by faith in this condition. Deuteronomy. 20.3.
It is necessary that a Christian should live by faith in that condition. For
all spiritual soldiers must put one courage and resolution not to fear the
assaults of mighty enemies, nor be dismayed at any difficulties. Let not your
hearts fear, tremble not because of your enemies; quite your selves like men,
1. Cor. 16.13.
be strong. But true valor cannot be had without faith in Christ. Stand fast
in the faith, be strong. The Devil is like a serpentine Crocodile, whose
property is, if one follow, it flies away, if one fly, it pursues him
Resist Satan, and he will fly: be afraid, and he will follow. Cowardice does
encourage the adversary, courage daunts him. But courage issues from sound
onfidence in the Lord, Psalm. 31 2. and 71 3. and 61.2.3 Deuteronomy. 32.4. Psalm.
27.^4. and 31.24. Deuteronomy. 31.6.7.8.
who is the rock and shield of them that fly unto him. Wait one the Lord, be
of good courage, and he shall strengthen thy heart. Be strong and of a good
courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God he it is that
does go with thee, he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Of our selves we
have no strength to prevail against the strong one in the world: all our
victories must come of God, 1. Pet. 1.5. Genesis 3.15. Romans 16.20.
his power does all our works for us. We are kept by the power of God unto
salvation, he bruiseth the Serpents head, he dissolueth the works of the
Devil, he treads Satan under feet. The chiefest strength of soldiers lies
in their Captain, who yet must fight for themselves and him, by their own
power and skill: but all our strength lies in Christ, the Captain that
leads us to salvation, from whom we receive all power and ability to do
what is good, whose Almighty power subdueth all things for us. We our selves
before our conversion are of no strength, Romans 5.6. 2. Cor. 3.5. Act. 3.16.
not sufficient to think a good thought: all our sufficience is of God. But we
cannot be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Ephesians. 6.10.
unless we believe and lean upon it. Gods strength is the matter apprehended,
Exodus 14.13.
faith the hand whereby we apprehend it. This is our strength, stand still,
fear not, behold the salvation of the Lord. If we had the strength of our
first parents and were left to our selves, we should come short of happiness:
this is all our security, Psalm. 108.13.
that it is Gods strength being trusted unto by faith, that must help us to
salvation: Through God we shall do valiantly: he is our shield, tower, 1.
Ioh. 5.4. Math. 16.18.
rock strength and glory. Faith is of force to keep us against all assaults
of the Devil: This is our victory which overcomes the world: this is so
mighty, that the powers of Hell cannot prevail against it. Faith does latch
the fiery darts of the Devil, Ephesians. 6.16.
that they fall off without piercing us: or if they enter, it does quench and
allay their burning heat, that they shall not kill us. Peter had the dart
stuck in him a while: but faith did renew repentance; and healed him, making
the poison of sin a Treacle. Paul was buffeted with inward suggestions, and
had troubles as thick as haile-stones following him; yet all these prevailed
not against him, 1. Tim. 14.7.
because he kept the faith. The Devil will renew his assaults against us, and
we must renew our courage and strength against him; which cannot be done,
unless we live by faith. He that has no trust in himself, but leans on
the power of God, will, though he fall often, still have hope, and be
courageous to set upon his enemies with fresh assaults after some foil
received. For he that knows he has no strength, cannot wonder, if when God
leaves him he do fall: and he that makes Gods strength his stay, The acts of
faith in respect of these temptations.
though he be never so far from a thing, yet will not cast away hope in time
to obtain. The acts of faith in respect of temptation be these or such like.

But yet when he rages with greatest fury, it assures that he is chained up
by the power of Almighty God, and can go no further, then he will give him
leave. Well may the Devil bark and roar, like a band-dogge or Lion safely
chained or shut up, but he cannot stir further then God is pleased to let
him lose. He cannot tempt whom he will, nor when he will, nor how he would,
not by what means, nor in what measure he would, nor with what temptations,
nor for what continuance: in all these he is confined by the prouid^nce of God,
who has promised, that he will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are
able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, 1. Cor. 10.12.
Mark 5.12.
that we may be able to bear it. A legion of Devils could not enter into a
Gadarene Hog, till Christ had given them leave. Satan cannot touch one Bleate
pertaining to Job, till he have obtained liberty: Job 1.12. and 2.6
nor then lay a finger upon his body, till his liberty be renewed. The Devil
is the sinful Author of Temptations, whereby he seeks to molest and
overthrow the Saints: but God in his infinite wisdom and mercy does limit
them both in respect of time, place, person and temptation it self, and direct
them to such an end as Satan never intended. Faith speaks on this wise, Satan
desires to fifth me as wheat, but it is the Lord who has made choice of this
temptation wherewith I am exercised rather then another, and has set bounds to
the spiritual enemies of my soul, what time they shall continue to assail,
how far they shall proceed and no further, and will direct the temptation to
a good end, above all I can conceive: therefore I will not fear the enemy but
wait upon the Lord.

1. Cor. 2.11.
The Devils aims are not ever one and the same. Always he labors the
destruction of the Saints, but his ways, whereby he endeavors to effect it,
are contrary. Sometimes he purposes to entice unto sin by his allurements;
sometimes to vex, trouble, and drive into despair; at least to make the life
of a Christian vnco^fortable with his manifold and hellish assaults. This is
wisely discerned by faith, whereby the stratagems of our Adversary are more
easily disappointed. For as an Enemy, who intends by policy to get the
victory, is more then half overcome when his plot is disclosed: so it is
here, Satan is soon discomfited, when his intents and proiects are manifested
and made known.

Rabshakeh revile the living God, Esaias 36.21.
the people of Judah will hold their peace, and not answer him a word, least
being enraged he should blaspheme the more. Direct opposition in such cases
stirs up the outrageous blasphemer to grow more furious. When the Devil
requires of our Savior to fall down and worship him, he reasons not the
case, but repelleth him with detestation, Avoid Satan. Math. 4.20.
Giving us to understand, that the blasphemous may not be reasoned with, if
they should, it would make them but burst forth into greater outrage against
the peerless wisdom of God. Wherefore if Satan buffet us with suggestions of
this nature, it is our wisdom to turn from him, and to make our complaint
unto the Lord. So Hezekiah spread the blasphemous letter of Sennacherib, Esaias
37.14.
before the Lord: And when the enemies of David insulted over him, as though
there had been no help for him in his God, he cries, Lord, how are mine
enemies increased. Psalm. 3.1.


Math. 16.18.
It is the promise of our Savior, that Hell gates shall not prevail against
his faithful people: they shall fight against them, but not prevail. When the
spirit of man begins to faint, faith bids him be of good courage, for there is
help in Heaven. The Devil may thrust sore at thee, but shall not get the
victory, Psalm. 91.2, 3.
for God is with thee. If the Lord plunge thee into the Sea, he will go down
with thee thither to keep thee, that thou shall not be drowned; although Hell
gates had shut mouth against thee, yet there his Almighty hand will be with
thee, Esaias 50.7, 8, 9.
and from thence his arm will deliver thee. Fear not, for the Lord will be
thy defense, and the shadow of his wings thy cover.

call to remembrance the promises of grace, exercise thy self in works of
mercy. Make this use of all his malicious assaults, that thou be quickened to
stick faster unto the word of promise, lift up thy heart to crave his aid
with confidence, and take courage to labor more earnestly in the paths of
righteousness. For Satan will then cease to vex with his temptations, when
that which he puts as a stumbling block, we make a spur and incitement to
more diligence in well-doing.



it be not circumuented by the wiles of Satan. Faith may slumber and take a
nap for a little season, when it is ill at ease: but the property of faith,
when lively and in good plight, is to keep waking. For nothing is more wisely
fearful then faith, nor more cautelous and circumspect then holy fear:
Nothing more careful and suspicious then faith: more waking and industrious
then holy care and suspicion. Nothing more covetous and courageous then faith,
more watchful then covetousness and courage. Faith makes a man jealous of
himself, lest he take cold, catch a knock, or be deceived; cautelous and
circumspect, that the Devil get not advantage, set not upon him at unawares;
desirous to keep standing, grow in grace, live in peace with God, and valiant
in the Name of God to take arms in the cause and quarrel of God against
principalities, powers and spiritual wickednesses. Fear, care, suspicion,
covetousness, courage any one of these, is sufficient to keep waking in
earthly things: and when all of them jointly concur, shall they not have this
effect in spiritual? Satan is vigilant to tempt, as he can epsy his
opportunity: and faith is watchful to avoid the snare, or withstand the
assault.

Revel. 12.12.
as the Proverb goes: so it is with Satan, his rage is greatest, when his
time is shortest. Even as the darkness is greatest a little before day: so the
grand pieces which the Devil keeps in store, until the case be desperate,
be with the claps they give, and mists they send forth, messengers of his
retiring, and our deliverance which is before the door. Math. 4.10, 11. Luke
4.13.
The last temptation wherewith Satan set upon Christ was the most furious, and
when he could not prevail thereby, he departed from him for a season. The Lord
knows well the malice of Satan, and the weakness of his children: his fury
to devour, and their frailty to stand long in the encounter: therefore he
will not suffer that roaring Lion above measure to discharge upon them. This
faith assures of, 1. Cor. 10.13.
and persuades quietly to wait for.

Paul was buffeted by the messenger of Satan, he besought the Lord often in
that thing. 2. Cor. 12.8.
Thus when we are led into darkness without light, we lean upon God, and
cry unto him for salvation. If a child have his Father by the hand, though he
be in the dark, or otherwise see what hurt might him approach, and make often
at him, yet he is not afraid: and so it is with us, whilst by the eye of
faith, we see that invisible one, at out right hand to support and save us.
Neither are we scarred at this, that Satan does shift his temptations, and
return again after he had left us for a season: But having experience of
Gods gracious dealing and tender compassion, we fly unto him, and shroud our
selves under the shade of the Almighty. If we have in some fits found case by
this or that means, we know if we come into like case how to help our
selves; it is we say, but doing such a thing, or taking such a matter: thus
having once found in distress and temptation, strength and deliverance by
recourse to our God in Christ, we know what to do when such like state
returns on us. Satan will not cease to assail though he be overcome; nor
the Belieuer faint though he be set upon again and again: but having once
returned with victory through the power of God, he will abide in the secret
place of the most High for ever.

Why the godly sometimes want the sight of Gods graces.
Tenthly, The faithful are the Lords vessels, which he uses to scour by
temptations. True it is, that in the time of trial, the graces of the Spirit
do not so much appear to the notice of the believing heart: but by the
ouer-ruling providence of God, they serve for the increase of grace, as the
truth teaches, faith belieueth, and experience can testify. Thus faith
ministers comfort in the most bitter agonies, if it be rightly used, and
stirred up. But what if the child of God be brought so low, that he can
discern no spark of faith, no fruit of grace, no mark of Gods love in
himself? It is not to be doubted, but the servants of Christ through their
weakness, are often brought by extremity of temptation into woeful desolation,
which yet the Lord does wisely order for the glory of his Name, and the good of
his dejected servants. And as in other things, so in this, that they cannot
discern any fruit of the Spirit, wherewith through the mercy of God, they are
comfortably replenished. For the blustering Tempests which the enemy raises
against them, cause such disturbance in the soul, and fill the heart with such
confusion, fear and terror, that for the present they are altogether unable
to judge of their own estate. For when the Mind is ouer-clouded with the mists
of Temptation, as the eye with the rising of dust; and the heart tossed too and
fro with unquietness, as the waves of the Sea when the winds are boisterous;
conscience by recoiling upon the soul cannot conceive, or give right notice of
it true state and temper. Troubled water will not give back the reflection of
the countenance: nor an afflicted Spirit the true disposition of the inner man.
When the poor Christian makes search into himself, the temptation first puts
forth it self, wherewith the heart is daunted, and thereupon concludes, that
no grace does lodge or abide in him, because at first sight it does not
appear. Unto these may be added, that good men are sometimes pertishly
disposed, to cast away all they have as nothing, because they have not what
they desire, or imagine others to enjoy: herein resembling little children, who
for want of some small trifle that they desire, or some of their fellows have,
throw away many things much more precious.

But not to inquire further into the causes of this mistaking, The Remedy of
this.
the remedy is;



Secondly, It is the wisdom of a Christian in this case to observe the mark
that Satan drives at, which is to hide from his sight the graces of the Spirit,
that he might bring him to despair. This being the Devils aim, he must
stir up himself to believe, and roll his soul upon Christ for salvation.
For when he can see no grace in his soul, he cannot but see himself to be
miserable, and so called to come unto Christ the fountain of living waters,
that by him he might be replenished, in him he might find refreshing. Again,
taking courage to believe, he disappoints Satan, who intends not so much to
draw him into security, as to force him to cast away all hope of mercy. Oh,
but a Christian is to examine and try himself, whether he be enriched with
the graces of the Spirit, or no? True it is, that the examination of our hearts
is a necessary duty, but to be done in due order, so as we be stirred unto, not
driven from the practice of other duties no less needful: But when the soul
is distempered with the assaults of Satan, and unable to judge of it own
state, it is unseasonable to make search into our hearts, and preposterous is
to give place to doubtings, because we cannot find what we desire. We have a
commandment to believe, as well as to prove our selves, both which must be
coupled together, otherwise neither can be done as they ought: and it is a
plain case, that he who finds himself to be poor and naked, is called to
come unto Christ, that he might receive of his fullness, be enriched with his
plenty. If thou can not find in thy self what thou seek after, come unto
Jesus Christ, and believe in him, that thou may receive what thou seek,
and is to be found in him.



Math. 12.43, 44 Luke 11.24, 25, 26.
is it not of God? The unclean spirit might easily enter into the house with
seven other spirits worse then himself, and dwell there, if he found it swept
and garnished, that is, empty and destitute of grace. The strong man armed
might well break into the house, if a stronger then he did not keep
possession. As the children of God are conquerours over many temptations, so
one only temptation (and that of no long continuance) is able to sink the
stoutest among the Reprobates, who are mere dross and refuse, into the
bottomless pit of Hell. The strong assaults whereby the Devil labors the
ouer-throw of the poor servant of God, is to him an argument of strength
received, or that God will strengthen him. For if he look unto God in the
tentation, he calls not forth his servants to the conflict, until they be
furnished, nor will he let Satan loose until he have enabled them to make
resistance. He will not lay weight upon green Timber: nor crush the tender
youngling with burdens unsupportable: whom God does employ in his war either
he has, or will make them able for the service. If he have an eye, unto
Satan's malice, why does he muster all his forces to besiege, if there be no
strength to withstand? The long continued furious tentations of Satan do make
proof, that the heart is well fortified against him. Means to stir up our
selves to live by faith in time of dreadful temptation.


The way and means to stir up faith in these perplexities and times of
grievous temptations, is:

Ezra. 9.6.
for my sins are multiplied exceedingly, and mine iniquities are risen up
against me. I was conceived in sin, I I have lived in vanity: my thoughts
are loose, mine affections boisterous I have disesteemed mercy, regarded lying
vanities; given way to doubtful reasonings, pettishly taken on when my carnal
desires have been crossed; distusted thy promises, disputed with thee of thy
judgments; given way to thoughts of unbelief, harbored unquietness and
discontent: and so exposed my soul to the most violent, horrible and fiery
tentations and assaults of Satan. My soul which should be seasoned with sweet
meditation on thy goodness, mercy, and grace manifested in Jesus Christ,
delighted in the promises of mercy, and ravished with the joys of Heaven, is
continually pestered and assailed with the black and hellish thoughts of
Atheism, despair, blasphemy, discontent; and extremely tortured with
soule-vex^ng fears. O my God, look mercifully upon the misery of a poor
distressed sinner. I am brought into great darkness, and can see no light.
There is no soundness in my flesh, nor rest in my bones, nor quiet in my
soul. My heart trembles, my strength fails me, my life is spent with
grief, my spirit within me is overwhelmed: and prevailing fears so tyrannize
over me, that I cannot speak. My Mind is full of disorder and confusion, my
heart of terror: my soul refuses comfort. In the day I am terrified with
thoughts, in the night affrighted with dreams. Psalm. 38.8.10. Psalm. 32.4.
I am sore wounded and broken, I go mourning and desolate all the day: my
moisture is like the drought of summer, and in this deep discomfort the
Tempter cease not to suggest, Psalm. 3.2.
That there is no help for me in my God.

out of thy remembrance for thy Names sake. Psalm. 130.5.
There is mercy with thee concerning sin: pardon the trespasses of thy poor
servant, and impute not unto me those hellish thoughts suggested by Satan,
which through thy grace I detest unfeignedly, under which I desire to be
sincerely humbled, and from which I heartily beg to be delivered. Return, O
Lord, Psalm. 31.16.
cause the light of thy countenance to shine upon me; refresh my parched soul
with the sense of thy mercy; dispell the mists of tentation, rebuke Satan, and
restrain his malice. Thou art the God of peace, tread Satan, Romans 16.20.
I beseech thee under my feet shortly, that with a quiet and cheerful Spirit
I may sing of thy praise, and serve thee in holiness and righteousness all the
days of my life. Thou art my strength and portion, my rock and tower of
defense, unto thee do I fly for succor, Oh, plead my cause against the
enemy of my soul, and thy glory. I am purposed through thy grace to stick
and cleave fast unto thy mercy, never to assent unto or approve his horrible
suggestions: 1. Ioh. 5.18. Psalm. 35.17. Ps. 22.21.22.
Oh keep me that the evil one may never touch me. Lord, how long will thou
look on? rescue my soul from the fiery assaults of that wicked one; my
darling from the Lion. I am sore troubled, I am bowed down greatly, Psalm.
31.10.
I walk in heaviness all the day long: My heart pants, my soul is
exceedingly disquieted with tentations. Ps. 35.22, 23.
This thou have seen (O Lord) keep not silence: O Lord be not far from
me. Stir up thy self, and awake to my judgment, curb and chain up Satan,
that he may molest no longer, and strengthen thy poor servant, that through
thy might, I may conquer and triumph over him. And my soul shall rejoice in
the Lord, Psalm. 35.9.10.
it shall rejoice in his salvation. All my bones shall say, Lord, who who is
like unto thee, which deliuerest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
yea the poor and needy, from him that spoyleth him.

of Satan, and stir up himself courageously, valiantly to trust in the
mercies of the Lord, and rely upon his grace. Why art thou cast down, Psalm.
43.5.
O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? why do thou harbor
perplexing doubtful thoughts, and in much pensiveness toss too and fro the
tentations of Satan. Psalm. 39.3.
This musing kindles the fire: the more thou think upon the tentat on, and
art disquieted with doubtings, the greater liberty has the Devil to tempt,
the less able are thou to with-stand his malice. If thou be dejected, he will
be insolent: if thou be aff^ighted, he will be the more furious. Trust
therefore in the Lord, and wait upon his grace: for he has seen thine
adversity, he will hear thy prayers; the sins cleaving to the tentations
which thou so much fear, are pardoned and forgiven unto thee. Evil thoughts
conceived with delight, pleasure, and purpose, are most displeasing unto God,
dangerous unto the soul: but even hellish tentations, which never found
consent or approbation under which thou art humbled, from which thou earnestly
crauest to be delivered, doubt not, but upon thine unfeigned suite, they are
freely remitted and done away. Be strong, and of good courage, fear not, nor
be dismayed: for the Lord will be thy defense, and under the shadow of his
wings thou shall be safe. Satan cannot tempt longer then God shall give him
leave: and he will never suffer thee to be tempted above measure, but will
give a good issue unto the tentation. 1. Cor. 10, 13.
Thou art called to fight under the banner of Christ Jesus, and in the name of
the Lord thou shall be enabled to do valiantly and overcome. Psalm. 60.12. 2.
Cor. 12.9.
If Satan continue his assaults, Gods grace is sufficient for thee. If thy
strength be clean gone, Gods power shall be magnified the more in thee: and he
has brought thee low, that thou may not trust in thy self, 2. Cor. 1.9.
but in the living Lord, and that the whole praise of the victory might be
ascribed unto him. If thy strength did remain, it was not to be leaned unto;
and now it is decayed and gone, there is no cause of fear: for the Lord w ll
be thy stay. In the most difficult assaults and tedious encounters we are
exhorted, Ephesians. 6.10.
to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Be of good courage,
and God will grant thee an easy, a joyful victory. Satan's drift in tempting
is to turmoile, dis-hearten, perplexe with fears, and drive into despair: and
if thou take heart and courage to rest quietly upon Gods grace, and fly unto
his Name, thou shall put him to flight, thou have already got the day. Wait
but a while, and these dark mists, and terrible storms shall be dispersed. By
these temptations the Lord has taught thee to see thy weakness, and the
malice of Satan; to deny thine own wisdom, and prize his favor: lightly to
esteem all things here below, and highly to value mercy reaching to the pardon
of sin, and heavenly communion and fellowship with God: And if this bitter
potion has wrought so kindly for thy spiritual good, why should thou be
dismayed? Trust in the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
thee. Psalm. 31.24. and 27.14. Psalm. 34.22.
The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants, and none of them that trust in
him shall be desolate.

oppose them, yielded to thoughts of unbelief; given way to discouragements,
as if it had been in vain to pray, omitted the duty upon conceit of
unfitness, dullness, unworthiness; accounted the duties of my calling tedious
and burdensome, set open my heart to intangling scruples and distracting
fears, questioning the love of God toward me upon every false suggestion, and
concluding often through unbelief, that God had shut up h s loving kindness for
ever in displeasure. So foolish have I been, and ignorant: even in this point
a beast. Pardon, O Lord, the infidelity, doubting, deiectednesse, and carnal
excessive fears of thy poor servant; deliver my soul from the snares of
Satan, acquaint me with his Methods in tempting, and how I may prevent him, and
strengthen me in the combat, that I never faint, nor break off the course of
godliness through unbelief. I am purposed through thy grace, to cast my soul
upon thy tender mercies, to seek thy face continually, to wait upon thee in
thine ordinances, and to exercise my self in the works of Piety, Mercy, and
an honest calling. If Satan tempt to distrust, raise fears, seek to
discourage my soul, or break off my prayers by his hellish suggestions; I will
strive to maintain my faith, lay faster hold upon the promises of mercy, stop
mine ears against scruples and doubtings; take greater courage to draw nigh
unto God, believe the acceptance of my willing though weak service: and by how
much the Devil shall seek to oppose or hinder my comfort, courage, or
constancy, so much the more will I stir up my self to go forward and
continue therein. The Lord will hear a sigh or groan, bottle up a tear, and
graciously accept poor and mean service from a sick child. I perceive the
maine scope of Satan in suggesting hellish temptations, is to drive me into
despair, disquiet the soul with fears, cast me into deep, unprofitable
sorrow, and discourage in every holy duty, that I might altogether neglect it,
or with great heartlesnesse go about it, as if it were unprofitable, should
never be accepted. And I shall then prevent Satan, and put him to flight, when
I take occasion by his temptations to stick closer unto the word of promise,
stir up my self zealously to seek the favor of God; turn my thoughts from
disputing about his suggestions, pray that I may be fitted to pray, wait upon
God for help, beg the pardon of daily infirmities, and take heart and
resolution to commit my soul unto him in well-doing, striving daily to reform
what is amiss, and grow in grace; but not questioning acceptance because of my
infirmities, present dullness, and distemper of soul, being wasted and spent,
Psalm. 17.13.
whiles I struggled with the temptations of the Devil. Arise, O Lord,
disappoint Satan, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked one: Be
thou my strength in trouble; incline thine care unto my prayer, and save me,
for I fly unto thee for succor. I am ready to halt, Psalm. 38.21.
and my sorrow is continually before me. Forsake me not, O Lord, O my God, be
not far from me. Hide not thy face far from me, put not thy servant away
in anger: thou have been my help, Psalm. 17.9.
leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. Verse 11
Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine
enemies. Show me the path of life, guide me in the ways of peace, give thy
strength unto thy servant, and save me for thy mercy sake. Psalm. 17.5
Hold up my goings in thy paths, that I be not turned aside by the malice or
sleights of Satan. I am fully resolved to depend upon thy grace, and keep thy
Commandments, Lord have mercy upon me, raise me up, and strengthen me unto the
end. By this I know that thou fauourest me, Psalm. 41.11, 12.
because mine enemy does not triumph over me. Uphold me in mine integrity, and
set me before thy face for ever. And here, if the distressed Christian have
wasted his Spirits with violent and continual sorrow, he must be admonished
not to think, that presently he should recover former liveliness and
ability. Satan will not cease to suggest, that this course he has now set
upon is vain and fruitless, because he finds more dullness and loggishnesse,
then formerly. But he must tell himself, that natural powers once weakened
are not soon repaired; and in such case, when stirrings be less, the work of
grace may be more sound then heretofore. Liveliness and actiuenesse is
greatest in youth, but the truth of grace greater in age. Therefore he must
not scrupulously question his state, because he feels himself more feeble,
and less active then in former times.

CHAP. VII.
How to live by faith in the times of trouble and adversity, specially when we
be exercised with many and long afflictions.

Psalm. 34.19.
AFflictions are not more ordinary, then burdensome and heavy to be borne.
Many are the troubles of the righteous, and manifold the infirmities of the
righteous in their troubles. Sometimes they take carnal counsel; sometimes
they fret and murmr, 1. Sam. 27.1.
sometimes they faint and despair for a fit. David said in his heart, I shall
now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me, then
that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines. Psalm. 31.22.
Psalm. 77.3. Verse 7. Verse 8. We stand in need to be helped against
discouragements in affliction.
I I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes. I remembered God and
was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was ouer-whelmed. Will the Lord cast
off for ever? and will he be favorable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for
ever: does his promise fail for evermore? which frailty of the Saints does
lesson us, what need we have to be strengthened against all discouragements
and hindrances which in afflictions we shall meet withal, that we neither
grow weary, nor be turned aside in our Christian course. And the Lord, our
most merciful and loving Father, knowing it to be most necessary, has for
the comfort and encouragement of his children plentifully signified, that he
will correct them in wisdom, God corrects in great wisdom. Heb. 12.9, 10.
love and tender compassion, to the, purge and refine them; and graciously
promised to aid, comfort and direct, and in fittest time to deliver them out
of adversities. We have had Fathers of our flesh, who corrected us, and we gave
them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of
Spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their
own pleasure, but he for our profit, that we might be pertakers of his
holiness. Has he smitten him as he smote those that smote him? Measure. Esaias
27.7, 8.
Or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him? In
measure when it shoots forth, thou will debate with it: Ier. 46.28. and 30.11.
he stays his rough wind in the day of the East wind. Fear thou not, O
Jacob, my servant, says the Lord, for I am with thee, for I will make a full
and of all Nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end
of thee, but correct thee in measure, yet will I not leave thee wholly
unpunished. This is that which the Prophet so earnestly begged of God, O Lord,
Ier. 10.24.
correct me, but with judgment, not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to
nothing. He corrects but for awhile: For a moment Psalm. 30.5.
For his anger endures but a moment, in his favor is life: weeping may endure
for a night, but joy comes in the morning. He will not always chide: Psalm.
103.9. Ier. 3.12. Psalm. 125.3.
neither will he keep his anger, for ever. The rod of the wicked shall not
rest upon the lot of the righteous: lest the righteous put forth their hands
unto iniquity. For yet a very little while, Esaias 10.25.
and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction. For a
small moment have I forsaken thee, Esaias 54.7, 8.
but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face
from thee, for a moment: but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on
thee, says the Lord, thy Redeemer. Esaias 57.16.
For I will not contexd for ever, neither will I be always wroth: Mich. 7.18.
for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made. Who
is a God like unto thee, that pardons iniquity, and passes by the
transgression of the remnant of his heritage? in love and
He retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy. Whom the
Lord loves, he corrects, even as a Father the Son, in whom he delights.
Prou 3 12. Heb. 12.5, 6. Revel. 3.19. Tenderness. Esaias 63.9. Psalm 103.13.
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. In all their affliction he was
afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his
pity he rede^med them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of
old. Like as a Father pitieth his children: so the Lord pitieth them that fear
him. For he knows our frame: Verse 14.
he remembers that we are dust. How shall I give thee up, Hosea 11.8, 9.
Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How
shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are
kindled together. I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
return to destroy Ephraim, for I am God, and not Man, the holy one in the
midst of thee. To prove Deuteronomy. 8.2.
Thou shall remember all the way, which the Lord thy God led thee these forty
years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was
in thine heart. Psalm. 66.10. Purge
For thou, O God, have proved us: thou have tried us, as silver is tried. And I
will turn my hand upon thee, and pur^ly purge away thy dross, Esa. 1 25. and
4.4 Esaias 27.9. Refine Dan. 11.35. and 12.10. Zech. 13.9.
and take away all thy sin. By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be
purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin. And some of them of
understanding shall fall, to try them and to purge, and to make them white.
And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as
silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: and they shall call on
my Name, and I will hear them. 1. Pet. 1.6, 7.
Now for a season (if need be) ye are in heaviness through manifold
temptations: That the trial of your faith, being much more precious then gold
that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be sound unto praise, and
honor, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ. 1. Pet. 4.12.
Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, Job 33.16, 17, 18. Hosea
2.6, 7.
which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you. He opens
the ears of men, and seals their instruction, That he may withdraw man from
his purpose, and hide pride from man. He keeps back his soul from the pit,
and his life from perishing by the sword. He opens also their ear to
discipline, Job 36.10, 16. Confirm grace Deuteronomy 8.16. James 1.2, 3.
and commands that they return from iniquity. Who led thee through that
great and terrible wilderness, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good
at thy latter end. My brethren, count it all joy when yea fall into diverse
temptations, knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience. We
glory in tribulations also, Romans 5.3, 4, 5.
knowing that tribulation works patience, and patience experience; John 15.2.
Save.
and experience hope; and hope makes not ashamed. Every branch that bears
fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit. When we are judged,
1. Cor. 11.32.
we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Behold, 2. Cor. 4.17. He will
deliver them Job 5.17, 18. out of trouble.
happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not thou the
chastening of the Almighty. For he makes sore, and binds up: he wounds,
and his hand makes whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in
seven there shall no evil touch thee. Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest,
Psalm. 94.12, 13.
O Lord; and teach out of thy law: That thou may give him rest from the
days of adversity: until the pit be dug for the wicked. James 1.12. Is
tender over them in trouble. Psalm. 56 8. Psalm. 31.7.
Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall
receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.
Thou tellest my wanderings, put thou my tears in thy bottle: are they not in
thy book? I will be glad, and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou have considered
my trouble; Psalm. 33.18, 19.
thou have known^ my soul in adversities. Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon
them that fear him: upon them that hope in his mercy: To deliver their soul
from death, and to keep them alive in famine. The righteous cry, Psalm. 4.17,
18.
and the Lord hears them, and delivers them out of all their troubles: The
Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart: and saves such as be of a
contrit^ spi it: Psalm. 9.9. Verse 18.
The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppr^ssed: a r^fuge i^ times of
trouble. The needy shall not always b e f^rgotten: ^sal ^6 1. and present so
their help. Esaias 41.10, 11, 12.
the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. God is our refuge and
strength, a very p^esent help in trouble. Fear thou not, for I am with thee:
be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea I will help
thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. Behold,
all they that were incensed against thee, shall be ashamed and confounded: they
shall be as nothing, and they that strive with thee shall perish. Verse 14.
Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel: I will help thee, says
the Lord, and thy Redeemer, Esaias 49.13, 14.1^, 16, 17.
the holy One of Israel. Sing, O Heaven, and be ioyfu^l, O Earth, and break
forth into singing, O Mountains: for God has comforted his people, and will
have mercy upon his afflicted. But Zion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and my
God has forgotten me. Can a woman forget her sucking babe, that she should
not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will
not I forget thee. Behold I have grau^n thee upon the palms of my hands, thy
walls are continua^y before me. Psalm. 91.14, 15.
Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set
him on high, because he has known my Name. He shall call upon me, and I will
answer him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honor him.
In these and such like passages of holy Scripture, we see with what love and
tenderness the Lord does correct his children, for the glory of his great
Name, and their exceeding great benefit; that they might know themselves, their
frail^es and graces, be purged from their dross, emptied of
selfe-conceitednesse, confirmed in hope, patience, humility; qui^kened unto
pray^r, and fitted for his kingdom: how g^atiously he does protect and comfort
them ^n h^auinesse, l ghten their da^kenes, heal their wounds, k^ep^ their
feet from falling, cover them with his f^athers, hide them in his pauilion,
and set them upon high from such as rise up against them. He is the salvation
of the righteous, and their strength in time of trouble: Psalm. 37.39. Ier.
29.11.
His though^s toward them, are thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give an
expected end: Esaias 43.1, 2. Psalm 73.23.24.
He is continually with them, and holds them by their hand; he will guide
them with his counsel, and afterward receive them unto glory. These promises
so often repeated be firm grounds whe^eupon to build our faith, that we
shall not be hindered by afflictions in our Christian course, but rather
furthered, till we attain unto the end of our course in Gods Kingdom.

And surely it is most necessary that we learn to live by faith in
afflictions. Its necessary to learn to live by faith in affliction. Heb.
10.35.36 Heb. 6.12. Reu. 13.10.
For faith is the ground of silent and quiet expectation of salvation. When
Christians are persecuted for the name of Christ, all men see they have great
need of patience, that after they have suffered for a time, they might enjoy
the promise, which now they hold by faith, as it we^e by reuersion, not in
actual possession. But without confidence there can be no patience. Faith in
God is the only stay and support of the heart in trouble and affliction. Psalm.
27.13.
I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the
land of the living. Remember thy word unto servant, upon which thou have caused
me to hope. This is my comfort in my affiction, Psalm. 119.49.50.
for thy word has quickened me. In daily and lighter trials a man of mild and
patient temper may hold up the Head: but when one deep calls unto another,
and the waves flow over our head; when nature yields, and the heart faints,
then to stand fast and be of good courage, that only can faith do, which is
grounded upon the rich mercy of God, and relyeth upon his Almighty power.
Faith is the Palm, that sinkes not under the waightiest of burdens, the
Camomile that spreades the more it is trodden; the oil that ever ouerswimmes
the the greatest quantity of water you can power upon it. In the most
boisterous tempests it lifts up the chinne, that we shall not drown: Heb.
11.35, 36.
and when a man is half dead, it quickens and puts life into him. By faith the
Saints have endured cruel mockings and scourgings, bonds and imprisonments,
Ephesians. 6.16.
tortures and death and in all these were more then conquerours. Faith is the
shield of the soul, whereby it is defended against all the fiery darts of the
Devil. When we are afflicted, we shall be tempted to impatience, despair,
doubting of Gods love, and the use of wicked means to help our selves out of
trouble. Psalm. 3.2. and 31 11. and 35.15.36. Job 30.1.
The world will follow us with scorns and traunts, as if God had forsaken us
and would not arise for our help: Our own corrupt hearts will be ready to
start aside, repine, faint, question the Lords truth and mercy: 1 Thessalonians. 3.5.
and Satan will not be wanting to his opportunity with all his might, malice,
and subtlety to seduce, discourage, or terrify. When our Savior was an
hungered in the wilderness, Math. 4.3.
the tempter came unto him, and said, If thou be the Son of God, command
that these stones be made bread. Now seeing the burden of afflictions is made
more heavy by temptations accompanying, we had need to be well underpropped
with a lively faith, that we might withstand and repel the force of the
Enemy. Faith only supplieth all our wants in affliction. He that possesses
all earthly things in greatest prosperity and has not faith, has nothing in
deed; much less the man that lives in misery: but he that lives by says
wants nothing that is good, when miseries beset him on every side. For the
present riches of a Christian are the gracious and faithful promises of God,
which faith possesses, not looking to what we have in hand, but what the Lord
has laid up in store; and expects to receive from God in fittest season,
more assuredly, then if he had it in his own power to use. The Men of this
world trust their friends with their stock or money, and make account it i^ as
ready at hand, as if they had it in their own possession: and sure it is, the
true believe has just and good cause to trust God rather then himself, and to
rely upon his word for whatsoever he has committed unto him. F^i^h in time of
danger does as it were fence and compass us with the promises of God: but
without faith we are naked, and lie open to the malice of our Adversaries.
Behold, his soul which is lifted up, Hab. 2.4.
is not upright in him, but the just shall live by his faith. The unjust man
puffes up himself, and buildes towers of defense to himself: b^t the just man
belieueth, and that shall be to him in stead of all castles, towers, and
bulwarks in the world. For it brings us under the wing, presence, Psa. 18.2.
Deuteronomy. 32.30. Psalm. 31.3. and 71.3.
and protection of God: it makes him our refuge and safeguard, high rock and
tower of defense. Afflictions profit not, if they be not mixed with faith in
them that bear them. Bodily physic procures not health if natural heat be
lacking in the patient, which might cause the potion to work to the expelling
of the sick humor: faith in respect of afflictions the physic of the soul,
is that natural heat, whereby they are made to work kindly to the purging of
sin and the increase of grace and comfort: where it is altogether wanting,
their can be no kindly work.

The righteous are allowed to live by faith in the times of evil, when
calamities of all sorts compass them about, The Godly are allowed to live by
faith in afflictions. 1. Tim. 4.8. Romans 8.28.
for godliness has the promise of this life, and that which is to come: and
the godly are to believe both, according to the word of the Lord. God has
promised, that all things shall work together for good, to them that love God,
1. Cor. 10.13. Act 27.25.
and that he will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able: and it
is our duty to believe God, that it shall be even as he has told us. The
godly have had this confidence in formers times, whose practice is both a token
of our privilege, and a pattern of our duty. What time I am afraid I will
trust in thee. Psalm 56.3. Psalm. 31.5.
Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou have redeemed me, O Lord God of
truth, yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will,
Psalm. 23 4.
fear no evil; for thou art with me, thy rod, and thy staff they comfort me.
Come, and let us return unto the Lord: Hos. 6.1.2.
for he has torn, and he will heal us, he has smitten, and he will bind
us up: After two days will he revive us, in the third day he will raise us
up, and we shall live in his sight. God is hereby much glorified that we
rely upon him as our rock of defense, all-sufficient Savior, and trustiest
friend in time of distress. It is one of the Lords most royal titles, Psalm.
60.5. Psalm. ^.9 Psalm. 10.14.
to be the Father of the Fatherless, and a judge of the widows, a refuge for
the oppressed, and the helper of the poor. Thou have been a strength to the
poor, Esaias. 25.4.
a strength to the needy in his distress; a refuge from the storm, a shadow
from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is, as a storm against the
wall. Esaias 30.18.
And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and
therefore will he be ex^lted, that he may have mercy upon you. The Lord has
commanded us to wait upon him in the days of calamity and sorrow. Hab. 2.4.
The Just shall live by faith. It is the ve y scope of this text to teach this
one po nt of doctr^ne to the Jews, when they would be oppressed by the
Babilonions, viz, that in greatest d^ngers, the only way is to stay our
selves, and establish our hearts by faith on Gods promises. Confidence in God
does the more bind and oblige him, Psalm. 37.40.
as it were, to do us good. The Lord shall help the righteous and deliver
them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them because they trust
in him. Esaias 26.3.
Thou will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because
he has trusted in thee. I will sur^ly deliver thee, Ier. 39.18.
and thou shall not fall by the word, but thy life shall be for a prey unto
thee because thou have put thy trust in me, says the Lord. If a friend ^ lie
and build up our faithful promise, we take our s^ues bo^n^ not to fr^strate
his exp ctation in a ^ead lift: Psalm. 141.8.
the Lord will never lea^e the soul destitute; which trusts in him. The
faithful have promised themselves, help, and confidently begged aid, because
they trusted in the Lord: Be merciful unto me, O God, Psalm. 57.1.
be merc^full unto me, for my soul trusts in thee; yea in the shadow of thy
wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be over past. Cause me to
hear thy loving kindness in the Morning, for in thee do I trust; Psalm.
143.8.9.
cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for I lift up my soul unto
thee. Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies, for I fly unto thee to hide me.
And to hope in God, and to have God for our help, are linked together in
Scripture, so that his help is re^die for all them, who rest upon him in
truth. Happy is he, that has, Psalm. 146.5.
the God of Jacob for his help: whose hope is in the Lord his God. Acts of
faith in respect of these promises.


The acts of faith in respect of these promises be these.

Shall there be evil in a City, Esaias 45.7. Amos 3.6. Job. 1 21.
and they Lord has not done it. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away. I
know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness have
afflicted me. Psalm. 119.75.
If ye endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons: Heb. 12.7.
for what son is he, whom the Father chasteneth not. And this is one special
ground of humilation, patience, and comfort. Come, and let us return unto the
Lord, Hos. 6.1.
for he ^ath torn, and he will heal us. My son, despise not thou the
chastening of the Lord, neither be weary of his ^rrection. For whom the Lord
loves he corrects, Pro 3.11.12.
even (...) a father the son, in whom he delights. Let him curse: for the
Lord has bidden him. It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction,
and that the Lord will requite good for his cursing this day. But of these more
particularly hereafter.

Israel. Faith speaks on this manner; We have no might against this great
company, 2 Chro. 20.21.
that comes against us: neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon
thee. And great is the benefit of this instruction, for it draws the heart
from carnal repose in means or friends; it expells vexations and distracting
cares, and estranges from the use of unlawful means of deliverance
whatsoever. Pro. 21.31. Psalm. 33.16.17.
The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the Lord.
An horse is but a vain thing to save a man; neither is any man delivered by
his great strength. And the same may be said of wisdom, swiftness, wealth,
or the force of any means whatsoever, Eccl. 9.2. Psalm 127.1. Esaias. 30.7. and
31.3.
though never so lawful, or likely: But as for unlawful means, no good
success can be hoped from them. The Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no
purpose; therefore have I cried concerning this, their strength is to sit still.

Hos. 5.15.
that seeks to cure the disease, by taking away the cause thereof: when God
takes trial of us that we might know our selves, faith makes search into the
heart; 1. Cor. 11.31. Lam. 3.40.
when he judges by his chastisements, faith makes us to judge our selves:
and when God strikes for sin, faith strikes at the head of sin. Let us
search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. I thought on my ways:
Psalm. 119.59.
and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. When Manasses was in affliction, 2.
Chro. 33.12. Job 34.31.32.
he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of
his Fathers. Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement,
I will not offend any more, That which I see not, teach me; if I have done
iniquity, I will do no more.

Psalm 37.7. Psalm. 62.1.5. Lam. 3.16. Esaias 30.15.
and patiently to bear his correction. Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently
for him: fret not thy self because of him who prospers in his way. Yet unto
God my soul keep thou silence: for from him is my expectation. By faith the
servants of God have been enabled to say, The word of the Lord is good, Esaias
39.8. Mic. 7.9.
I will bear the indignation of the Lord: because I have sinned against him,
until he plead my cause, 2. Sam. 15.26.
and execute judgment for me, If he say thus, I have no delight in thee,
behold here am I, Psalm. 131.2.
let him do to me as seems good unto him, Surely I have behaved and quieted
my self as a child that is weaned of his Mother; my soul is even as a weaned
child. I was as a man that hears not, Psalm. 38.14.15.
and in whose mouth are no reproves. For in thee, O Lord, do I hope.
Guiltiness of Conscience (which is ever fearful) and untamed passions make
unquietness, when the rod of God is upon our backs; both which are corrected by
faith. The conscience is comforted by faith, resting upon the gracious promises
of pardon, and giving assurance that sin is pardoned: Passions are curbed and
bridled by the sovereignty, of faith, as having the affections under command,
which it does season and move according to the direction of the word: and by
strong, potent, irressistible persuasions, whereby it works the soul to this
sweet and heavenly submission. And as a plaster, By what considerations faith
preswades to meekenes under Gods hand.
which upon sore flesh causes much smart, upon sound flesh stirs no pain:
so troubles lighting upon a soul healed by grace, and seasoned by faith, are
nothing so grievous. The considerations of faith, whereby it persuades unto
me^knesse, be such lik^. Lam. 3.39.
Wherefore does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?

John 18.11.
little better then dreams, of destiny and providence: Faith does evidently
and certainly assure of this ground of patience and comfort, that the least
ticke befalls us not, without the ouer-ruling eye and hand, not only of a wise
God, but of a tender Father, and fellow-feeling Elder brother, who best
knows, and can measure out exactly what is meetest. He will not lay upon man
more then is right, Leuit. 10.3. Job 34.23. Psalm. 9.9. 1. Sam. 3.18.
that he should enter into Judgment with God. I was dumb, and opened not my
mouth because thou did it. It is the Lord, let him do what seems him good.

Thirdly, Out of this principle faith extracts this infallible conclusion, This
Cup, how bitter and wringing soever, is a medicine to cure, not a poison to
destroy, mingled by him, that most perfectly does understand our need, our
st^ength, and the working of his own potion; ministered in great love and
tender compassion to drive out corruption, confirm faith, preserve from
falling, strengthen grace, weane from the world, and bring nearer to God by
unfeigned repentance. If it be sickness or poverty, Esaias 57.16.
it is in our Fathers own hand, and he will not contend for ever, lest the
spirit should fail before him: If he turn us over to a servant to scourge
us; yea, though Satan himself buffet us, yet he stands by to number and
moderate the stripes, that they shall not lay more upon us then shall be for
our good; Zech. 1.15, 16.
and he will enable us to bear. I am very sore displeased with the Heathen
that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward
the affliction: Therefore thus says the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem with
mercies. 2. Cor. 12.9.
My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.
What-euer falls being in Christ, it cannot bend to our utter confusion: but an
issue shall be given unto it. What terrible noise soever the storm shall make
over our heads, it shall be but as haile-stones upon the tiled or leaded house,
that rattle more then hurt. We are kept by the power of Christ, 1. John 5.18.
that the Evil one shall not touch us: we are in safe harbor under the rock,
and shall never be confounded. Sick we are, and that of diverse humors, which
may breed dangerous diseases if they be not prevented: troubles, losses,
disgraces, dangers and such like, are the Lords baths and pills, whereby he
rids us of that infectious matter, which would impair our spiritual health,
if it were let alone; his bitter potions, Esaias 27.9. Dan 11.35. Deuteronomy. 8.3. Heb.
12.11. Deuteronomy. 3.16. Romans 5.3, 4. Zech. 13.9. Mal. 3.3. 1. Pet. 1.7.
that shall work for our health and welfare. He has said unto Crosses, purge,
refine, try, exercise, breed the quiet fruits of righteousness, give them
experience of their faith, confirm their patience, support their hope, make
them bring forth more fruit: but he has given them no allowance to hurt, vex,
confound, weaken faith, or waste any grace of the Spirit. When we feel our
bowels wring, or (as in a Sea-sicknesse) are dead sick for the present, then
faith puts us in remembrance, we shall be the better many days after. Physic
makes sick before it give health: so do afflictions, but the fruit is
pleasant. When they are a little over we shall be able to say, Oh, this was
good for me, I would not for any thing, Lam. 3.27. Psalm. 119.71.
but I had borne the yoke in my youth, that I may live the more comfortably in
my age. Wise parents do not always correct their children in measure, as
being ignorant of their nature and disposition. The most learned Physician may
be deceived in the disease and constitution of his patient, mistake in the
quality or strength of his Physic, and so miss of his intended cure: But
the spiritual Physician of our souls, does so exactly know our temper and
disease, does so entirely affect our health, so accurately mingle the malign
and poysonfull ingredients in our Physic with correctors and allayes, that
the confection shall be good, and altogether shall and must work for the best.
What though they be bitter to the taste? It is better with the body when it
feeds on sour herbs, which breed good blood, then on sweet meats which
engender bitter vomits, and mortal sicknesses. The true soule-sicknesse, viz.
sin and corruption that dwells in it, does cleave so fast, and has eaten
so deep, that gentle purges, easy corrasiues (that scarce work to sense or
feeling) cannot expel or remove it. Prou. 20.30.
True it is, that all evils in themselves are hurtful, but faith looks upon
them as they are changed in and by Christ, who has taken away the poison which
would be in the crosses we bear, and makes them serviceable for our good:
Even as the art of the Apothecary does make a poysonfull Viper into a wholesome
Treacle.

A man will bear much when he spieth this, that it comes from love in
another to him: But God is love it self, and from love proceeds every course
he passes upon us, Heb. 12.5, 6. Prou. 3.12. Job 5.17. Apoc. 3.19.
as well this of adversity, as the other of prosperity. Whom he loves he
chasteneth, and scourges every son whom he receives. The care and good will
of Parents shows it self in providing Medicines and Physic, which may
preserve or procure the health of their children, no less then in their
allowance of meat, drink, apparel, or other benefits, which they bestow upon
them. And God is as merciful in preparing and ministering Physic for our
souls health, as in all other his daily benefits. Nay, herein does appear the
most special and tender regard that God has over us. Esaias 48.10.
For if good things be wanting, to the body specially, we are apt to ask, and
seek after them: But should the Lord let us alone till we find out the
diseases of the soul, and be desirous of, or willing to receive his
medicinable potions, our sores would grow incurable, Job 2.10.
we should perish in our sins. Therefore, as the belieuer does receive good
things from God with joy: so does he evil with meekness. The child will take
from the mothers hand, as well sour as sweet, because he is persuaded of her
tender love and affection: so does faith entertain afflictions from God,
knowing them to be fruits of his grace and fatherly compassion.

Deuteronomy. 4.29, 31, 32. and 30.3, 4. Leu. 26.41, 42. Esaias 54.6, 7, 8.
faith brings tidings that God will look down from Heaven in mercy, and send
help in fittest season. If their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they
then accept of the punishment of their iniquity. Then will I remember my
covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaake, and also my covenant
with Abraham will I remember. And this does maruellously quiet and still the
heart. Should a man be very sick whilst the Physic does work, he would
not be dismayed so long as he knew the fit should last but a season; and then
ease should return with health: Esaias 39.8.
And so it fares with the faithful in their afflictions: Hezekiah said to
Isaiah; Good is the word of the Lord which thou have spoken; he said moreover,
for there shall be peace and truth in my days. Rejoice not (says the Church)
against me; O mine enemy; When I fall, I shall arise, Mich. 7 8, 9.
when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me. I will bear the
indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my
cause and execute judgment for me; he will bring me forth to light, and I
shall behold his righteousness.

Heb. 12.2, 3.
faith does re-minde us of our conformity with Christ in afflictions, and of
his partnership with us therein. If he that was the firstborn, the only
begotten and entirely beloved Son of God: if he that was without sin, yet
was not without stripes; should we hope to go free, or look to be cockered
continually? All the Sons of God by Adoption are predestined to be made
like their elder-brother, as in holiness and glory, so in afflictions. Should
we think much to sip or taste of that cup, which he has drunk off for our
sake? The first lesson we take out in the school of Christ is, Math. 16.24.
Deny thy self, take up the cross, and follow the Lord Jesus. And the
sorrows which we bear, Esaias 63.9.
are not so much ours as Christ's. In all our troubles he is troubled with us:
what burden soever lies upon us, he ^eeles the weight of it. Acts 9.5. Col.
1.24. 1. Pet. 4.13. Apoc. 11.8.
When Stephen is stoned, he is persecuted: the wrong done to the Saints, is
offered to him. And he can no more be unmindful of his people, then
forgetful of himself.

Job, and all holy Martyrs has obtained: but that far most excellent weight
of glory, which Paul eying, counted his afflictions (which to us would have
been intolerable) light and momentanie, 2. Cor. 4.17.
not worthy to be named in comparison: which made him not only not weep, and
howl, but sing in the Dungeon, and reckon it a special favor and honor to
be counted, not only a belieuer, but a sufferer for Christ And even as waters
fall down into valleys, not able to abide in grounds that lie high: so the
sense of these afflictions goes away from minds that are lifted up in such
contemplation. By these and such like persuasions, faith allures the heart
willingly, freely, constantly to resign it self to the good pleasure of God
in all things.

The fifth Act of faith. Psalm. 94 12. Verse 13.
The fifth act of faith, It teaches wisdom to judge aright of all afflictions.
Blessed is the man whom thou instructest, and teach him out of thy law:
scil. wisely to consider of afflictions; of their nature, end, use, and issue
to them that fear God. He shall rest, or be quiet in the days of adversity.
Did we not through false glasses see things otherwise then they are, they
would not cast us down so much as they do. Want of heavenly wisdom, what
voices does it draw from us? Even such as these; Were it any thing but this, I
could hope to receive good from it. Whereas through the spectacles of faith we
come to discern, that the things we suffer are most fit to do us good. For fa
th sees not according to sense or outward appearance, but as the truth is in
Jesus Christ, always magnifying the wisdom and courses of God, as best and
most for our profit. Esaias 11.2.
The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of judgment and counsel was powered
upon Christ; of which Spirit we partake by faith, and so are made wise to
perceive the things of God, and to judge aright of his dealings toward us. And
from this proceeds willingness to give our necks to the yoke, when God is
pleased to put it on. Fear of hurt is that which makes us shun the cross,
or go heartlesse under it: when once by faith, the scales falling from our
eyes, we come to see it useful, beneficial, healthful, we strain courtesy
no longer, but take it down.

A^ise, cry out in the night: Lam. 2.19.
in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water, before the
face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him. Be merciful unto me, O God be
merciful unto me, Psalm. 57.1, 2. 2. Chron. 14.11.
for my soul trusts in thee; yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my
refuge, until these calamities be ouer-past. I will cry unto God most high:
unto God that performs all things for me. Trust in him at all times, Psalm.
62.8. Esaias 26.16. Psalm. 142.1, 2. Job 5.8. and 11.13.
ye people power out your hearts before him: Lord in trouble have they visited
thee; they powered out a prayer, when thy chastening was upon them. The
counsel, which Elephaz and Zophar gave to Job, faith does apply and put in
practice; which was to seek unto God, and commit the cause unto him; to
prepare the heart and stretch out the hands toward him. Having no wisdom of
our selves to make use of chastisements, nor power to deliver our souls, faith
urges to seek unto God, that he would lead us by his grace in the way that
we should go, Esaias 48.17.
teach us to profit, and in due time vouchsafe freedom and deliverance. The
true belieuer desires the benefit and fruit of restraint and correction, no
less then the comfort of freedom and liberty. He couets that the spiritual
sickness, may be removed, when the bitter potion is taken away. A wise patient
will neither refuse to swallow bitter pills, when it may be for health; nor
disorder himself to make work for the Physician: he will take Physic to
recover strength, and lay it aside when the troublesome malady is expelled. A
believing patient had rather be held in a continual course of Physic, then
that the matter of spiritual sickness should gather, and engender diseases in
the soul. Deliverance with inward soundness is the thing which he longs
after, and beggeth of God. Thus faith will not suffer impotently to fret,
repine, or murmr; nor yet to grow secure, as though it were no great matter
how things went, forward or backward: it does both calm the heart, and kindle
desires. Nor does faith incite barely to cry unto God in distress, but in all
conditions establishes the heart upon his aid, that it looks not after other
means of deliverance, Job 27.9, 10. Psalm. 5.3. Mich. 7.7.
then he affords. The upright man will delight himself in the Almighty, when
trouble comes upon him; he will call upon God at all times, and look unto
him for help.

7. Act.
Seventhly, It raises the heart being conscious of it weakness to rest upon
the Lord for strength, who makes us able to do all things through his
strengthening of us: Phil. 4.13. Col. 1 11. Ephesians. 3.17.
who strengthens his in the inner man to long-suffering with ioyfulnesse; who
has said, such as look to me, shall renew their strength, Esaias 40.31.
they shall mount up with wings as Eagles, they shall run, and not be weary;
they shall walk and not faint: yea, Psalm. 94.22.
it fixes and est^blisheth the heart upon Christ the rock strong and
impregnable, whence follows courage and steadines to undergo them. Thou will
keep him in perfect peace (says the Prophet) whose mind or thought is stayed
on thee: Esaias 26.3. 2. Chron. 16.6, 7, 8. Psalm. 112.7.
because he trusts in thee. The righteous shall not be afraid of evil
tidings, his heart is fixed or established, and trusts in the Lord. Thus
faith sets the Lord always in it sight, and fortifieth the heart in
confidence of his might. Psalm. 16.8.
I have set the Lord always before me, Psalm. 73.23.
because he is at my r^ght hand, I shall not be moved; (that is) I have
overcome all temptations my hope being fastened upon the Lord; for he has
powerfully assisted and comforted me. Our strength is to claspe to Christ, and
hold to him, as the person in whom is all our strength. The hil-rats are a
weak creature, having neither strength of limbs, nor other means of nature
to defend themselves: Prou. 30.20.
but making their houses in the rocks or stony places, and flying thither in
time of danger, they save themselves, and provide safely for their young-ones.
We of our selves are feeble and weak, easily ouerturned with the least
temptation: but working our selves by faith into that rock Jesus Christ,
against whom the powers of Hell cannot prevail, we become courageous,
immovable, invincible. It matters not what weight be laid upon the foundation,
so it be sure and steadfast: if Christ be our supporter, (as by faith he is made
ours) nothing can ouerwhelme us. In quietness and confidence is our strength.
Again, Esaias 30.15.
by faith w^e receive the Spirit of fortitude and courage, whereby we are made
able to endure the burden of afflictions, and become valiant in combats. Esaias
11.2.
For the spirit of wisdom and ounsell, of understanding and strength was
powered into Christ, to the end we might boldly go unto him, to a ke those
things we stand in need of, and receive them by faith according to our measure.
Ephesians. 4.15, 16.
As the he^d communicates strength to the body, so Christ powers out the
virtue of his heavenly unction upon the whole body of his Church. When the
Apostles had received this spirit of strength, they make a play of all their
sufferings and labors; even as in bodily things, we see men that have
strength and courage (as these porters and such) they will make a sport to
bear such burdens, as a weak creature would tremble to lift at. For as
bladders swim aloft all waters whilst they are filled with wind: so do we
above all afflictions, Deuteronomy. 20.3. Josh. 7.5. Esaias 7.4. 2. Chron. 33.7. Prou
28.1. Psalm. 125.1. Esaias 12 ^. Josh. 10 25. Deuteronomy. 31.6. 1. Chron. 28.20. 2.
Chron. 32.7. Psalm. 27.14.
whilst this Spirit is with us, to support us in them. Fear, doubting,
feebleness, fainting, nice-tendernesse, or melting of heart proceed from
infidelity and distrust. Hardiness, courage, valor, invincible durance are
the fruits of faith, staying it self upon the Lord, and seeking unto him. Be
strong, be of good courage, fear not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord will be
with thee, he will not fail thee nor forsake thee. Distrust many times wrings
from us such voices as these, were it any thing but this, I could hope to bear
it: Whereas did we in conscience of our impotencie seek to Christ to make us
able, and fasten our selves upon him by a lively faith, we should find
strength enough through his might, whereby to bear that comfortably, which we
think most intolerable. Faith drives a man out of himself, as not able to
bear the least cross as he ought, and through the power of God it enableth to
bear that best (how troublesome soever) with which God is pleased to try us.

8. Act.
Eighthly, By faith the godly heart is drawn to use all lawful means of help,
that God in his providence does afford, Mich. 7.7. Hab. 2.1. Psalm. 5.3. Psalm.
109.31. Psalm. 22.24. Psalm. 56.9. Heb. 11.2 7.
but rests quietly upon Gods promises, and assurance of his presence above
all likelihoods and appearances, God shall stand (says the Psalmist) at the
right hand of the poor to save him from those, that condemn his soul. When I
cry unto thee, then shall mine en mies turn back, this I know, for God is
for me. Moses left Egypt, and feared not the wrath of the King: because he saw
him that was invisible. The reason hereof is, faith coupleth the means and the
end, but looks to the promiser, his grace, faithfulness and power (who is
able to do above all that we can comprehend) and not to the probability of
the thing promised. Ephesians. 3.20. Romans 4.11.11.
Abraham against hope believed in hope, that he might become the Father of
many Nations, being fully persuaded, that what God had promised, he was able to
perform. Heb. 11.11.
By faith Satah received strength to bear a Son, when she was past age; What
manner of dependence on the promises faith works.
because she judged him faithful who had promised. This dependence on the
promises which faith works, is absolute, without limitation of time, measure
of affliction, or manner of deliverance. All these it refers to the good
pleasure of Gods will, Esaias 28.16.
and reposeth it self securely upon his faithful word and providence. He that
belieueth will not make haste. Fear rides post to out-runne danger, and folly
turns over with speed, our mourning part before God, delighting to be in the
house of laughter: but faith, which leans upon the promises of truth, makes
no haste without good speed. Dan. 9.2.
Daniel waited seventy years for deliverance out of captivity in Babylon,
and then finding the time of redemption to be at hand, he prayed to God for
the same. As for the measure of affliction, or means of deliverance, Job 13.15.
the voice of faith may be heard in Job and Abraham. The one promised he would
trust in God though he should kill him; The other being commanded to sacrifice
his only Son Isaac, Heb. 11.19.
the son of the promise, believed that some other way he should receive him
from the dead. This effect faith brings forth when all means fail, yea,
against all oppositions in show never so strong and irresistible. Esaias 63.5.
For the means of themselves be of no worth and validity, and God is the
same, one and unchangeable (whosoever oppose themselves against his
determinations) most ready to succor when all means fail. God is our refuge
and strength, Psalm. 46.1, 2, 3.
a very present help in trouble: Therefore will we not fear, though the
earth be removed, and though the mountains be cast into the midst of the Sea.
Psalm. 49.5. Psalm. 56.4.
Though the waters thereof roar, and be troubled, though the mountains shake
with the swelling thereof. Wherefore should I fear in the days of Evil, when
the iniquity of my heels (that is, the wickedness my feet carried me to)
shall compass me about. Ezra 8.21.
For the hand of our God is, upon all them for good that seek him, but his
power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. The Lord is my light
and my salvation, Psalm. 27.1, 2, 3. Psalm. 3 6. Psalm. 54.4, 5.
whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of life, of whom shall I be
afraid? Though an host should encampe against me, my heart shall not fear.
Behold, God is my helper, Psalm. 118.7. Psalm 46.5, 7.
the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. He shall reward evil unto mine
enemies; cut them off in thy truth. But for support in this case, faith turns
it self to meditate on Gods truth, which never fails; his might which cannot
be resisted; his wisdom, which ever effects his own works by means best
approved, Psalm. 116.5, 7.
in his counsel, in the fittest season; and his tender compassions whereby he
is ready to succor them that are brought low. Psalm. 22.4.
Again, it looks to the manner of Gods dealing, and to the usual course,
which he has held with his servants in all ages past: Ex. 3.8. and 5.6.
which is to grant deliverance, when the afflictions of his servants be
increased, and send help when to sense and reason it is furthest off. Ezekiel.
18.4.
For every soul is the Lords, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of
the son: and what favor he has showed unto any one, he will vouchsafe to
every one that seeks him diligently, if it may be for their good. It is also
confirmed by the experience of Gods dealing with us in former times of
distress and danger. Psalm. 22.9.
Thou art he that took me out of the womb; thou did make me hope, when, I
was upon my mothers breasts. I was cast upon thee from the womb; Psalm 71.17.
2. Tim 4.18.
thou art my God from my mothers belly. O God, thou have taught me from my
youth; and hitherunto have I declared thy wo^drous works. For former mercies
are as bills obligatorie under his hand, to assure of future good things, as
they shall be needful. That which God has once done for us in sustaining,
quickening, quieting our spirits with peace which passes understanding, keeping
our hearts, that he will do every day unto us, if we enforce our selves
toward him. Moreover, a good heart will not cease to accuse, check and
condemn it self for the Infidelity, distrust and weakness of faith that it
espieth; to incite, stir up, and call upon it self more confidently to
wait, and trust in the Lord; and in bitterness of heart to seek and sue unto
him for more strength from above. Psalm. 42.5, 11.
Why art thou cast down, O my soul, why art thou disquieted within me? Hope
in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. O God, my
soul is cast down within me.

Ninthly, Faith belieueth one contrary in another, 9. Act.
and out of deepest distresses gathers assurance of sweetest deliverances.
For the Lord shall judge his people, Deuteronomy. 32.36. 2. Kings 14.26. Psalm. 9.9.
and 10.
and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone,
and there is none shut up or left. The Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed:
a refuge in times, or due time of trouble. Man's extremity is Gods
opportunity: Deepest misery is the fittest season for deliverance. Men often
like to Swallows, will be with us in Summer, but leave us in winter. The
Devil, when he has drawn his into the briars will give them leave to look
for themselves. But God has ever stood nearest to his, when their exigences
have been greatest. The experience of misery and calamity is made the sure
ground of such joyful hopes, as the Lord has promised. Psalm. 20.1. Exodus 14
22. Dan. 6.22.
The greater sorrows the people of God suffered, the more undoubted experience
they had of divine truth contained in Mosaicall threatenings: the more undoubted
the experience of their truth, upon consciousnesse of their own
transgressions, the greater motives they had upon hearty and sincere
repentance, to apprehend the stabilitie of his sweetest promises for their
good. No depression of this people, but served as a countersway to hasten,
intend, or enlarge the measure of their wonted exaltation, so long as they
rightly weighed all their actions and proceedings in Moses balances, and
compared their permanent sorrow for sin past with their wonted delight in their
permanent sorrow for sin past, with their wonted delight in transient
pleasures. Ier. 30.13, 14.
This that the Lord had stricken Jacob with the wound of an enemy, and with a
sharp chastisement for the multitude of his iniquities, is propounded as an
argument of consolation: for because the Lord had killed, they must believe, he
would make alive again. The present wounds inflicted contrary to the rules of
politic defense, were the best pledges of their future health, beyond all
hope of State-Surgeons. And when Jeremy more admired, then distrusted Gods
mercies, in tendering the purchase of his Kinsmans field to him, when the Kings
and Princes of Judah had no assurance of so much possession in the promised
Land, as to inherit the Sepulchers of their Fathers: the Lord expels not his
suspensiue, rather then diffident admiration with signs and wonders, as he
did Gideons doubt, Ier. 32 24, 25. etc.
or his stiff-necked Forefathers distrust. By what means then? By the
present calamities which had seized upon the Cities of Judah, and that very
place, wherein his late purchased possession lay. This is the very scale of
Ieremiahs assurance, Ier. 32.42, 43.
from the Lords own mouth. Thus says the Lord, like as I have brought all
this great plague upon this people; so will I bring upon them all the good that
I have promised them. And the fields shall be possessed in this land, whereof
ye say, It is desolate without man or beast, etc. The depth of misery is
usually made an argument to move the Lord with speed to hear and send help:
and this is grounded upon the p^omise of God to give audience to his children,
Psalm. 10.1. Deuteronomy. 30.1, 2, 3. Nehem. 1.7, 8. Psalm. 44.23.24.
when in their distresses they remember themselves, and seek his face. Awake,
why steepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever. Wherefore hidest
thou thy face, and forgets our affliction and oppression? Attend unto my
cry, Psalm. 142.6.
for I am brought very low, deliver me from my persecutions: for they are
stronger then I. What, that as we feel God to be true in his threats, so we
may be assured he will not fail of his promises.

Lastly, it rejoices in tribulations, 10. Act.
and tryumpheth before the victory. The patient is glad when he feels his
physic to work, though it make sick for the time; because he hopes it will
procure health. Iam. 1.2.3. Romans 5.3.4.5. Heb. 12.11.
We rejoice in afflictions, not that they are joyous for the present, but
because they shall work for our good. As faith rejoices, so it tryumpheth in
assurance of good success: for it sees not according to outward appearance,
but when all means fail it keeps God in sight, and beholds him present
for our succor. As for me, I will come into, Psalm. 5.7.
thy house, in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship
toward thy holy Temple. Psalm. 13 5. and 16.8.9. Psalm. 142 7.
I have trusted in thy mercy, my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. The
righteous shall compass me about: for thou shall deal bountifully with me. We
must live by faith in the heauiest and longest afflictions.
Thus are we to live by faith when God is pleased to exercise us with
afflictions of what sort soever, though heavy to be borne and of long
continuance. Great troubles of long durance are the exercises of faith, as
weighty burden are trials of strength. As none for a little headache, or for
the ranch of a pin will seek to the bodily Physician or Surgeon: So it is in a
manner with the soul, whilst it is troubled with like grieuances spiritual.
Little things do not much exercise our faith, nor stir us up to seek God,
and short afflictions are soon forgotten. Faith indeed despises not the
least cross, but is most proved and stirred up in the greatest. Without
question there is most need of faith, when afflictions lie the heauiest, and
the more because Satan will be most busy at such times to molest and trouble;
he wills to show his power and malice when we are most feeble. When God
follows a man with one affliction upon another, and those of great
continuance, then the Devil will tempt to impatience and despair, as if God
took him for his enemy, and would not show compassion any more. When the
heart fails, because of the multitude of evils that compass us about, and
God hides his face, man is apt to conceive, sure God has forsaken me, and
will not arise for my help. If God did love me, he would never have absented
himself so long, now I am brought so low, in so greiuous distress. How should
the poor soul, weak and feeble in it self, stand under this great weight of
sore affliction increased by temptation and continuance, if it be not vpheld by
a lively faith? The acts of faith in this case.
The acts of faith in this case, are for substance the same with those before
mentioned, but for the help of the distressed Christian, who may be unable to
direct himself, I conceive it not amiss to repeat the principal.

1. Pet. 1.6.
First, it teaches that many and strong afflictions of great continuance are no
more the^ necessary. A wise Physician will not minister a strong potion, where
a lenitiue or gentle matter is enough, nor put one dram too much in his
prescription: much less will the Lord. We need great afflictions that our
corruptions may be subdued within us. Job. 11.12.
For as the vntamednesse of some colt is such, that unless he were sore
ridden, he would never be broken, so it is with our rebellious nature.
Learning tells the Physician, that in healing some bodily diseases the patient
must be kept so low, that he must be almost pined with want, before a spring
of better blood can be procured. Job. 33.17.22. Psalm. 107.12.17.18.
Faith instructs, that God is as it were forced to cast man upon the bed of
sorrow, till his days draw toward the burial, and his bones begin to
clatter, that he might hide, that is, suppress and remove his pride, and cure
the distempers of the soul. Our afflictions are many and diverse, because our
corruptions are many, and of diverse kinds, and such as are not expelled with
one purgation. If one medicine fit not our sore, will we not seek another.
What Father will not use many remidies to help the infirmities of his Child,
if one do no good? Our heavenly Father keeps us in a daily course of
physic, now with one thing, now with another, because we profit not with any
one alone. When afflictions are grown ordinary, and usual, they move the
less, because they be familiar; therefore God is pleased to alter and change
his medicines, that they might work more kindly. And as it is necessary that
afflictions be strong and diverse, so also that they be of long continuance: for
grown deseases are not hastily removed, not old sores quickly healed. As
stains long settled in a cloth, require much scowring and long whiting: so do
the evils which have deeply eaten into our soul. In others we may behold
what is needful for our selves. Genesis 15.13.
The posterity of Israel endured trial four hundred years. The elder people
of God were all led captive seventy years. Dan. 9.2.
By woeful experience every Godly man may find, that being newly taken out of
the furnace, he stands in need to be refined again. Be our afflictions of
never so long continuance in this life, we are well assured, they shall not
press us longer then sin does harbor in our bosom. And if faith be not
overcome and vanquished with daily and continual conflicts against corruption:
why should it faint under the burden of long during crosses. Sin is more
opposite to faith, more perilous to the soul, then any fatherly Chastisements
(though sharp and cutting,) as the disease is worse then the physic
ministered to expel it.

Psalm. 31.25. Esaias 27.8. Heb. 12.8.11. Jer. 46 28. 1 Cor. 10.13. Psalm. 103 10.
who corrects in measure, and for our profit, who has determined the time
and weight of our afflictions, and by his blessing will turn them to our good:
who does proportion our evils according to the strength we have, or which he
will give, not according to our deseruings, and also continue our afflictions
in great wisdom, faithfulness and mercy. Even as the Physician only can
prescribe what quantity of physic is to be taken, with what change, and how
long the course or diet is to be continued: so the Lord only does appoint the
measure, variety and continuance of troubles, wherewith he is pleased to
exercise us. Wicked men cannot set the time, nor measure out the quantity of
such measures, whereof they are instruments; to the godly for they would know
no mean, nor ever make an end. They may be fit executioners of Gods will
herein, when they be set too, and taken off, according to his appointment: but
unfit determiners what is to be inflicted, or how long it must be endured. Nor
are we our selves to appoint the quality of our Chastisements; or the terms
and seasons wherein and how long they shall be continued: for we would taste
only, (if at all) of the milder physic, or sap but lightly of bitters
potions, when necessity requires we should take deep. The patient is not to
be trusted with the searching and dressing of his own wound, if painful to
be handled. Now seeing it is the Lord, great in mercy, infinite in wisdom,
abundant in love and tender in compassions, who does mingle our cup, why
should we fear or faint? If Jacob had held or tended Joseph in prison, would
he have used him roughly, Esaias 49.1 5.
or kept him ouerlong? No no: much less will God; (who is more merciful then
any Father, and more pitiful then any Mother) hold us ouerlong, or deal
rigorously with us: but ordering all corrections by his Fatherly providence,
he will in his good time make them work together for good, Lam. 3.32.33.
Math. 10.30.31
and not for evil unto us. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered,
Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value, then many sparrowes.

deeply to humble himself before God, and fervently to (...) me^cy for sin
past, wisdom to make use of ^resent misery, and favor and mercy to be
delivered and set free. Sinful men (if well advised) strike not without cause:
the just God when he corrects, has ever just reason. And forasmuch as our
consciences for the most part are blinded with ignorance and self love, or
over clouded with sinful lusts, (as looking-glasses covered with dust) that
we cannot find out of our selves much that is out of order, nor amend what we
epsy to be amiss, faith directs to seek unto God by hearty prayer, who
can thoroughly acquaint us with our selves, and teach us to reform what he
would have us to amend. Why does the Lord give his children the repulse when
they cry unto him in their calamities, Judge. 10.13.14.15.
but that he would have them search more narrowly into their courses, and more
unfeignedly prepare themselves to seek and return unto him? And if they pray
unto him, he will instruct what is to be done. Hos. 14.2. Math. 11.19.
He who will have sinful men to join instruction with correction, yea and
puts into man such regard of dumb creatures, that he will not strike a
dog, but he will make him see, so well as he can, what it is for which he
strikes him; shall not he instruct us, when his hand is now upon us for want
of duty to him? But when we see our faults, and smart for them in such sort
as we account greiuous, there is no power in us to redress, and set straight
what is crooked and out of frame. It is God only, who is able to bless
afflictions and make them profitable: we of our selves are like little
children, who being taken in the fault, and fearing the rod, promise to do no
more, but presently forget both the fault and danger. This we learn by faith,
which soundly lessoneth us to deny our own wisdom, and strength, and in all
purposes, resolutions and endeavors to beg wisdom and strength from God
above, and wholly to rely upon his power and grace. In vain should iron be
beaten, did not fire soften it: in vain should affl ctions (which are Gods
hammer) strike on our he^rts, should nor God holy Sp rit, which is compared to
fire, both soften our hearts, and enlighten us to see our duties toward him,
and teach us to make use of the affliction wherewith we are exercised. Moreover
faith importuneth the Lord for mercy and deliverance. 2. Cor. 12.8. Psalm.
31.15.16.
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. My
times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them
that persecute me. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
mercies sake. Psalm. 40 13. Psalm. 88.13.14.
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make have to help me. Unto thee
have I cried, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. Lord why
castest thou off my soul, why hidest thou thy face from me. 4. Act.


Fourthly, Faith raises the heart to expect abundance of mercy from God, Psalm
69.^9. Phil. 1.19. 2. Cor. 1.5.
and through prayer and supply of the Spirit, to reap profit and taste comfort
answerable to the sorrows it has felt and endured. Great afflictions make
place for abundant mercy from God to us, which cannot be received without
singular joy on our part. An hard frostie winter makes a fruitful summer: an
afflicted state causes a mellow heart, if our sufferings be from God, we must
look for profit by every trouble, unless we will deny Gods wisdom, and
challenge his truth, or show our selves, as if we were not his children, nor
truly godly, Psalm. 90.15.
and loving of God. If God throw us down, we must wait to be comforted of
him, according to the years wherein we have felt afflictions. To say we cannot
think, that such a thing shall ever do us good, that ever we shall escape ou^
of ^uch a danger, that ever we shall see good days after th se and these
trials, Psalm. 85.6.
does argue great weakness and unbelief. For what cannot he make for our
good, 2. Cor. 4.6. Romans 4.17.
in what distress and anguish cannot he revive, who calls light out of
darkness, and things that are not as if they were, if we will give glory to
his Wo^d by resting upon it? Prou. 14.10.
The heart knows the bitterness thereof, and the stranger shall not meddle
with it joy. Thus living by faith in times of trial and visitation, does fit
and prepare the heart to thankfulness when light shall shine from on high; and
that so much the more, as our afflictions have been the sharper, or of greater
continuance. Return, O Lord, how long, Psalm. 90.13, 14.
and let it repent thee concerning thy servants; O satisfy us early with thy
mercy; Psalm. 30.11, 12.
that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. Thou have turned for me my
mourning into dancing; thou have put off my sackcloth, and girded me with
gladness: Psalm. 35.28.
To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent: O Lord my
God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. If one heal a trifling disease it
neither so binds the patient, nor commends the Physician: but if one heal
us of some deadly incurable malady, O we say then we could never have met
with such a Physician, not the like in the world again. Thou broughtest us
into the net, Psalm. 66.11, 12, 13.
thou laidst affliction upon our loins, thou have caused men to ride over our
heads, we went through fire, and through water; but thou broughtest us out into
a wealthy place. I will go into thy house with burnt Offerings, I will pay
thee my vows.

It will be objected, Prevention of Objection. That in affliction faith is
weak and corruption stirring.
That in affliction faith seems to be most weak, and corruption most
stirring.

greatly comfort us, if rightly understood. This mistaking must be corrected by
faith and spiritual wisdom.





spiritual health, it is the office of faith to receive the potion, and
further the kindly working of it: which cannot be done unless it give way
unto, yea, stir up godly sorrow, and wrestle painfully to drive out such
corruptions, as God would have removed by them. During battle the Soldier
must exercise his skill, valor and strength in repelling, subduing, and
pursuing the enemy: his refreshing comes when the fight is ended, and the
spoil divided. In the days of affliction faith is conflicting with doubts,
allurements, corruptions which show themselves; if we do not feel those
sweet comforts of the spirit, that our souls desire, let us wait with
patience, till the victory be obtained.

And if we would stir up our faith to believe and depend upon God in the
days of great tribulations, Helps to stir up faith in deep afflictions when
all means fail.
when all means of help fail, we must.

Lord, how am I beset with miseries? Psalm. 55.2.
How do my sorrows increase daily? I am the man that have seen affliction by
the rod of thine anger. Lam. 3.1, 2.
Thou have brought me into darkness, but not into light. My heart faints,
my strength fails, my skin is made old, Psalm. 38.10. Psalm. 22.15. Lam. 3.7.
my sight wax^th dim, and all my bones are out of joint. Thou have hedged me
about that I cannot get out, and made my chain heavy. My lovers and my friends

But they that seek my hurt do multiply, they speak mischievous things, and

I cry unto thee, but thou hear not; thou couerest thy self with a cloud
that my prayers should not ascend.

Psalm. 38.18. Hosea 5.15.
I will therefore declare mine iniquity, I will be sorry f^r my sin: I will
acknowledge my self guilty before the Lord. Psalm 40.12.

The loving kindness of the Lord endures at all times. Psalm 35 27. Psalm. 54.4.
He will not forsake his Saints although they be afflicted for a season. God
is my refuge, who has pleasure in the prosperity of his s^ruant, and will

be ouer-past. I am poor and needy, Psalm. 40.17.

Thou who have showed me great and sore troubles, shall quicken me again, and
shall bring me up again from the depths of the earth. When I was enclosed in
the womb, my distress and danger was great, my strength weak, my condition
hopeless: Psalm. 22.9, 10.
nevertheless I was saved by thy power, and by thy providence was brought
alive into this world: and should I now doubt of thy help and mercy, because
in likelihood I cannot see them? My flesh and my heart fails: Psalm. 7^.26.
but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. The depths of
misery are the Lords fittest seasons to rescue his afflicted ones. Merciless
men will show compassion in great extremity: and shall not the Lord; who is
rich in mercy and loving kin^nesse, extend his favor to me when I am re^die
to perish? Psalm. 85.9.
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him.

Cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning, Psalm. 55.1, 2, 3.
for in thee do I trust. Deliver me from mine enemies: I fly unto thee to
hide me. Lord, how long will thou look upon the mis^ries of thy servant, Psalm
35.17.
and keep silence: rescue my soul from the destruction of the adversary, my
darling from the Lions: Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, Psalm. 40
11. Verse 13. Psalm. 86.14, 15, 16.
O Lord, let thy loving kindness and thy truth continually preserve me. Be
pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me. O God, the
proud are ris^n against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after
my soul, and have not set thee before them. But thou, O Lord, art a God full
of compassion and gracious, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth: O
turn unto me, and have mercy upon me, give thy strength unto thy servant, and
save the son of thy handmaide. How long Lord, Psalm. 89.46.
will thou hide thy self for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? Remember
thy former loving kindnesses which have been of old: remember that I am but
dust, and that my days pass away like a shadow: remember the reproach of thy
servant, wherewith I am reproached, of them that dwell round about; wherewith
the ungodly and profane have reproached thy pure Religon, and blasphemed thy
holy Name. Lord look upon mine affliction, and my tears: for I am brought very
low.

Psalm. 56.3, 4.
What time I am in trouble I will trust in God: for he shall redeem my soul.
He is the God of my salvation, Dan. 12.1.

vouchsafe mercy to his chosen, above all they expect and look for, Psalm
55.19. Lam. 3.55, 56, 57.

and my prayer entered into his ears: therefore will I trust in him as long as I
live. Lord I will wait for thy salvation, establish my heart in thy truth, that
I be not moved.

CHAP. VIII.
What it is to live by faith touching the promises of earthly blessings,
temporal prosperity, and good success in the things that we go about.

THe Lord our God knowing that earthly blessings be so necessary for the
maintenance of this life, that we cannot be without them, God has made many
promises of earthly blessings.
has of his infinite bounty and free grace undertaken, and promised to make
competent provision for his children, that being freed from the cares and
troubles of these things below, they might with greater freedom attend upon
his service, and with more chearefulnes run the race of Christianity. O fear
the Lord ye his Saints: Psalm. 34 9, 10.
for there is no want to them that fear him. The young Lions do lack and suffer
hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. Trust in
the Lord and do good, Psalm. 37.3, 4.
so shall thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shall be fed. Delight thy
self also in the Lord, Verse 11. Psalm. 22.26. Psalm. 37.19. Psalm. 84.12.
and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. The meek shall inherit the
earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The meek shall
eat and be satisfied. For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will
give grace and glory: no good thing will he withold from them that walk
uprightly. Blessed is every one that fears the Lord: that walks in his
ways. Psalm. 128.1, 2.
For thou shall eat the labor of thy hands, happy shall thou be, and it
shall be well with thee. I will abundantly bless her provision: Psalm. 132.15.
I will satisfy her poor with bread. Matthew. 6.33.
Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto you. This is that which is so often repeated, That it
may go well with thee in the land, Deuteronomy. 5.16. and 6.3. and 12.25.28.
which the Lord thy God gives thee, In special the Lord promises length of
days, Health, strength, wealth, favor, peace, Joy, P^ou, 21.21.
good s^cc^sse, safety, good Name: and all these not only ^o the ^^ghteo^s
th^mselues, but to their children and p^steritie. Deuteronomy 5.33. Exodus 20.2. D^ut.
^5.15.
You shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God has commanded you,
that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prol^ng
your days in the land which you shall poss^sse. Psalm. 34.12, 13.
W^^t man is ^e that desires life: and loves many d yes, that he may see
good? Ke^pe thy tongue from eui^, and thy l^ps from speaking guile. My son
forget not my law, but l t thine heart keep my Commandments: Prou. 3.1, 2.
For l^ngth of day^s, and long life and peace shall they add^ to thee. V^rse
16. Prou. 14.10. Prou. 9.11. and 10 27. Psalm ^1.16. 1. Kings 3.14.
Length of day^s is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.
By me thy days shall be mu^tiplied, and the years of thy life shall be
increased. With long life will I satisfi^ him; and show him my salvation. If
thou will dilig^ntly h^arken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do
that which is right in his sig^t, and wilt give ear to his Commandments,
Exodus 15.26. and 13.^5. Deuteronomy. ^.15. Psalm. 103.3.
and k^^pe all his statutes, I will put none of these dis^as^s upon thee, which
I have brought upon the Egyptians, f^r I am the Lord that heals thee. Fear
the Lord and depart from evil; It shall b health to thy nauill, Prou. 3.7, 8.
and 4.22. Esaias 33.15.16.
and marrow to thy bones. He that wa^keth righte^usly, and speak th uprightly,
he that de^^iseth the gain of oppr^ssions, that shakes his hands from holding
of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes
from seeing evil; He shall dwell on high; his place of defense shall be the
munitions of rock^s, bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure. Verse
14.
And the inhabitant shall not s^y I am ^^^ke. Job 17.9.
The righteous shall hold on his way, and he that has cl ane hands shall be
stronger and stronger. Psalm. 29.11. Deuteronomy 8.18. Psalm. 103.5.
The Lord will give strength unto his people; ^he Lord will bl^sse his people
with peace. It is the Lord thy God that gives thee power to g^t wealth, that
he may est^blish his covenant which he swear unto ^^y ^^th r. H^nour the Lord
with thy ubstance, Pro. 3 9 ^0. Mal. 3.10.
and with the first f u^ts of all thine increase: So shall thy barnes be filled
with p^^ntie, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. Riches and honor
are with me, Pro. 8.1^.19.
yea durable riches and righteousness. My fruit is b tter then g ld, and my
revenue th n choice ^lu^r. In the house of the right^^us is much treasure. Pro.
15 6. Psalm. 112.1.2.
Blessed is the man that fears the Lord that delights greatly is h^s
Commandments. W^alth and ric^es shall be in his house: and his righteousn^s
endur^th for ever. If thou r^turne to the Almighty, thou shall be built up,
thou shall put away iniquity far from thy t^bernacles: Then shall thou lay up
gold as dust, Job. 22 23 24.25. Ier. 31.12.
and the gold of Ophyr as the stones of the brooks: yea, the Almighty shall
be t^y def nce, and thou shall have plenty of ^^luer. 2. Cor. 9.8 9.
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that y e always having
all sufficience in all things, may abound to every good work. With all thy
getting g^t understanding: ex^lt her, and she shall promote thee, she sh^^
bring th^e to honor, Pro. 4.8.9.
when thou do embrace ^er She sha give to thine head an ornament of grace,
a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. Pro. 3.4.
So shall thou find favor, and good understanding in the sight of God and
man. Then shall thou walk in the way safely, Verse 23. Pro. 1.33.
and thy foot shall not stumbl^. Who so heark^neth unto me shall dwell
safely, and shall be quiet from fear of eui^l. Because thou have made the
Lord, which is my refuge, Psalm. 91.9.10.
even, the most high thy habitation. There shall no eui^l befall thee, ne there
shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. Thou shall be hid from the scourge of
the tongue; neither shall thou be afraid of destruction when it comes. Job.
5.21.22.
At destruction and famine shall thou laugh, neither shall thou be afraid of
the beasts of the earth. And I will giu^ peace in the land, and ye sha^ lie
down, Leu. 26.6. Job. 5.23.
and none shall make you ^fraid. For thou shall be in league with the stones of
the fi ld: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee When a man's
ways plea e the Lord, Pro. 16.6.
he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 1. Sam. 2.30. Psalm. 37.6.
Them that honor me. I will honor. And he shall bring forth thy
righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noone day. The wise shall
inherit glory. Pro. 3.35. Pro. 10.7. Psalm. 112.6. Pro. 13.18. Pro, 10.6. Psalm.
1.3.
The memory of the Just is blessed; the righteous shall be in everlasting
remembrance. He that regards reproof shall be honored. Blessings are upon
the head of the Just; and whatsoever he does shall prosper. Blessed is the man
that fears the Lord etc, his seed shall be mighty upon earth, the generation
of the upright shall be blessed. Psalm. 112.1.2.
What man is he that fears the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he
shall choose. His soul shall dwell at ease, Psalm 25.^2, 13. Pro. 11.21.
and his seed shall inherit the earth. Though hand join, in hand, the wicked
shall not be unpunished but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
Pro. 14 20. Pro. 20.7.
In the fear of the Lord, is strong confidence: and his children shall have a
place of refuge. The Just man walks in his integrity: his children are
blessed after him. Job. 5.25.
These and such like be the promises concerning temporal blessings, which God
of his infinite grace and love has made to the faithful and their posterity,
that we might live by faith, quietly submitting our selves to the good pleasure
of God in these things, and expecting from him in due season such relief as
shall be most expedi^nt.

It is necessary to believe those promised.
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such
things as ye have. For he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee. Man is privy to his want of blessings, Heb. 13.5.
and will never cease with excessive care, deligence and vexation to hunt after
them, till he come to know that God will provide for him. When one has great
friends, which they are known to lean upon, we say of them, Such need take
no care, they know such and such will see to them. On the contrary, come to
one who knows no end of toyling and caring, ask him, why will you thus tire
your self out? He will answer, I must needs do it, I have none but my self
to trust to. Math. 6.30.32.
So Christ follows his Disciples carfulness to this door, their unbelief,
which did not let them consider our heavenly Father cared for them. No present
estate, (though never so great) can free the heart from distraction, 1. Pet.
5.5.
because it is subject to decay and vanish: we shall never cast the burden of
care off our own shoulders, till we learn by faith to cast it upon the Lord,
whose eye is over us for good.

Psalm. 52.7.
wisdom, friends, or strength, that makes not God his strength. The heart of
man being privy to his inability to sustain himself, if he be not underset,
will seek out some prop true or false, sound or rotten to lean unto. They
will go down to Egypt for help, Esaias. 31.1, and 22, 10, 11, 12.
and stay on horses, and trust in Chariots, because they are many, and in
horsemen, because they are very strong, who look not to the holy one of
Israel, seek not the Lord.

2. Chro. 20.20. 1. Chro. 5.20. 2. Chro. 16.7, 8.
Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established: believe his
prophets so shall ye prosper. Men are ashamed to falsify the trust that is
reposed in them: And shall the Lord frustrate the desire of them, that hope in
his mercy.

2. Cor. 1.20.
Both promises flow from one fountain, even Gods everlasting love, are
stablished in the same mediator, and received by the same faith: yea the
promises of life everlasting (as more spiritual and furthest removed from
sense) are in themselves more difficult to be believed: so that our assurance
of them c^nno^ b^ g^eat^r, (...), our confidence in ^od ^or the other which
conce ne thi^ l^fe, so f^rr^ as he sees it to be for our good; and the glory
of his g^e^t name, if we be instruct^d, exercised, and assa^lted in both
alike. Christian^ are of as^^^l ed touching these promises, and many vertuo^s
and godly men not duly consi^ering and embracing them by f^^th, are ^^ch
perplexed in themselves. Psa 116.11. Psalm. 31.22.
I said in ^y have (said David, when he fled from Saul, an^ hi^ heart began to
f^int) ^ll men are ly^rs; even the proph^ts, who told me I should be king, have

selves by reason of them. The rich man's we^lth is his strong City: he
rejoices in his riches, ^ro 10.^5. Psalm. 62.10. Pro. 30.8.9.
and has in his thoughts to do great matters by them. Give me neither
poverty nor riches, feed me with food conu nient for me: Lest I be full, and
deny thee, and say, who is the Lord. The godly are allowed to live by faith
touching these temporal promises, The godly are ^llowed to live by faith as
^^ching these promises.
and the sanctified use of Gods blessings which they ^nioy.

Romans 8.3^.
what is it then, that he will d ^^e unto us? Esaias 7.19.
The p omise of Christ before his incarnation was to the Jews a seal of all
temporal good things p omised. But we know God h^th given his sonn^, not only
to be bor^e, b^t to ^ie for us: which is an vn^o^^e^ t ken, that he will deny
us nothing that may be for our good and comfo t.

He that scattered Israel will g^ther him, Ier. 31.10.11.12.
and keep him as a sheepeheard does his flock. For the Lord has redeemed
Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger th^n he.
Therefore they shall come and sing in the h ight of Zion, shall slow together
to the goodness of the Lord, for wheat and f^r wine, and for oil, and for the
young of the flock, and of the herd: their soul shall be as a watered
garden, and they shall not sorrow any more at all. Verse 14.
And I will sati^te the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall
be satisfied with goodness, says the Lord. Ezekiel 34, 25, 26. 27.
I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beast to
cease out of the L^nd: and they shall dwell saf ly in the wilderness and
sleep^ in the woods. And I will m^ke them, and the places round about my hill a
blessing, and I will cause the shower to come down in his season: there shall
be showers of blessing. And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and
the earth shall yeel^ her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and
shall know that I am the Lord: I will call for corn, and increase it, Ezekiel.
36.29, 30, and 34, 29.
and lay no famine upon you. And I will ^ultiply the fruit of the tree, and
the incr^ase of the field; that y e shall no more ^eceiue reproach of famine
among the h^athen. I will eu n ^ t oath thee unto me in faithfulness, Hos 2.20,
21, 22.
and thou shall know the Lord. And it shall come to pass, in that day I will
^eare, says the Lord, I will hear the heavens, and ^^ey shall hear^ the
earth, and the earth shall hear the ^^rne, and the wine, the oil. Now seeing
the Lord has by promise and covenant, again and again repeated for our
confirmation, assu^ed us of all needful blessings, it is our duty by faith to
make these ptomises our own, and rest quietly upon his word to find relief
at such time, and in such measure, as he knows to be expedient, and may be for

commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful
Creator. 1. Pet. 5.7. Psalm. 23.1.
Cast all your care upon him, for he he cares for you. The Lord is my
shepherd, I shall not want. As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the
day, that he is among his sheep that are scattered: Ezekiel. 34.12, 13.
so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places, where
they have been scattared in the cloudy and dark day. And I will bring them
out from the people, and gather them from the countries, Verse. 14.
and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of
Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. I will
feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their
fold be; there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall the
feed upon the mountains of Israel. Mat. 6.31.32.
Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or
wherewith shall we be clothed? for your heavenly Father knows that ye have
need of all these things. God is the great Father of the family, who provides
all things necessary for them that be under his government. Psalm. 104 27.
Psalm. 145.15, 16
The eyes of all wait upon thee and thou give them their meat in due
season. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living
thing. Psalm. 146.9. Job 38.41. Mat. 6.26.
He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry. It is
his property, who is the chief good, to communicate his blessings unto his
creatures: much more to compass them with mercy that depend upon him. He
has put this natural affection into Parents, nay, into brute beasts to
tender their young ones: and shall not he much more provide for them that cry
unto him day and night for relief and succor? The Lords portion is his
people; Deuteronomy. 32.9. Ier. 10.16. and 51.19.
Jacob is the lot of his inheritance: and God is the portion of his people: He
has chosen them, and they have given themselves to him: they rely upon him,
and he has undertaken to make plentiful provision for them. Lam. 3.24.
The Lord is my portion, says my soul, therefore will I hope in him. The Lord
is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup; thou maintainest my lot.
Psalm. 16.5, 6.
The lines are fallen unto me in a pleasant places: yea, I have a goodly
heritage. The Lord by his special providence will make that prosperous unto
the righteous which they possess, be it little or much. There is nothing
better for a man, then, Eccles. 2.24.
that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good
in his labor, This also I saw, and it was from the hand of God. And this gift
the Lord freely gives to the man, whom he does approve: Verse 26.
To the man that is good in his sight God gives wisdom, and knowledge and
Joy, (to wit) together and use earthly blessings with delight and comfort. The
revenues of the righteous are small many times, but their state is comfortable:
Psalm. 37.16.
for the little that the righteous man, has is better then much riches of many
and mighty wicked ones, who flow in wealth, and excel in power. Prou. 15.16,
17, and 17.1.
Better is a little with the fear of the Lord then great treasure, and trouble
therewith. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, then a stalled Ox, and
hatred therewith. God gives his beloved sleep. Psalm. 127.2. Prou. 10.22.
And it is the blessing of God which makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with
it.

their spiritual welfare: Psalm 37.25, 26.
I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. He is ever merciful and lends, and
his seed is blessed. The children of the needy shall be succored in due
season, for God who knows their wants is faithful to pe form promise.

The acts of faith in respect of these promises.
The acts of faith in respect of these promises and blessings are.

Esaias 30.7.
The Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I cried
concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. Hosea 5.13, 14.
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound: then went Ephraim to
the Assyrian, and sent to King Ioreb; yet could he not heal you, no^ cure you
of your wound. If a man be soundly persuaded, that the blessing of God is all
in all, he will ply that fare first, and not undertake any thing, till he see
God witnessing unto him by his Spirit, that he will be with him to bless him:
which he cannot hope for, if the means used to compass and secure any
blessing or good thing, be indirect and sinful. Nay, to hope for blessed and
good success in any evil course is palpable and gross Idolatry: what is it
but really to acknowledge the Devil (whose direction thou followest for
advantage) to be the Governor of the world, and the disposer of earthly
things? then which nothing is more opposite to lively faith. Faith speaks on
this wise, Prou. 16.8.
Better is a little wrth righteousness, then great revenues without right;
more comfor^able in respect of inward peace, the present use of this life, and
continuance; which makes the Belieuer consult what is just, not what is
gainful or profitable: what may be compassed by honest courses, not what may
be gained by fraud, deceit, coozenage, or other carnal dealing. Again, faith
takes direction of God in his Word in all businesses, being assured that his
counsel only is firm and stable, and that course prosperous, which is
consonant to his revealed will. Prou. 19.21. Psalm. 33.10.
There are many devices in a man's heart, nevertheless the counsel of the
Lord, that shall stand. The Lord brings the counsel of the Heathen to
naught: he makes the devices of the people of none effect. The counse^l of the
Lord stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. Carnal
policies are disappointed, and counsels broken, but the direction of the Lord
it shall prosper.



I thought on my ways; Psalm. 119.59. Verse 67.
and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. Before I was afflicted I went astray;
but now I have kept thy word. Job 22.21, 22, 23.
The counsel of Elephaz to Job was good, if he had rightly applied it;
Acquaint now thy self with him, and be at peace; thereby good shall come unto
thee. Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in
thine heart. If thou return to the Almighty, thou shall be built up, thou
shall put away iniquity far from thy Tabernacles. This sound advice faith
digesteth, and with much seriousness does early with the whole heart seek the
Lord, exercise it self in the worship of God, labors the reformation of
what is amiss, and composeth it self wholly to the prescript ^ule of his Word.
By faith we know, James 4.8.10.
God will draw nigh to us, if we draw nigh to him; he will lift us up, if we
humble our selves in his sight; and if God lift us up, it shall go well; if
he be with us, we shall want nothing which may be for our good. This is the
way of faith, which cleaves unto the Lord, and seeks the accomplishment of
his promises, as God has promised to fulfill them.

Job 5.8. and 8.5. 1. Chron. 4.10.
and makes supplication to the Almighty. Oh that thou would bless me
indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thy hand might be with me, and that thou
would keep me from evil that it may not grieve me. If God will be with me,
Genesis 28.20, 21.
and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and
raiment to put on: So that I come again to my Fathers house in peace, then
shall the Lord be my God. It is the exhortation of Paul, Be careful for
nothing, Phil. 4.6.
but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your
request be made known unto God. Now faith turns precepts into prayers, and
makes request according to the will of God. What God requires, that faith
petitioneth for, and in such manner.

nec^ssary to salvation, and possess him as the portion of ou^ lot and
inheritance, who will keep back nothing from v^, but what is hurtful and
pernicious. It leans upon the everlasting providence of God, and promises
present succor and supply from him, as in wisdom he knows best, and of
grace h^th promised. Psalm. 16.8. Psalm. 73 23.
I have s^t the Lord always before me: that is, I constantly lean upon the
aid of God, and am fastened to his providence, being confident that when
necessity does urge, he will be a^ hand to sustain my soul, to minister
unto my necessiti^, powerfully to assist and comfort.

(scil.) in humility and me^knesse, free from carnal confidence and pride;
and in tenderness and compassion toward them that be in misery, specially the
Church, if she be in heauin^sse. For the blessings of God embrac^d by faith set
an impression upon the soul, answer^ble to those properties in him from whence
they flow. What he gives in grace does work the heart to humility and tender
commiseration. Psalm. 62.11.
Faith has learned that power is o^ God, and that all his gifts are freely
bestowed of mercy, without desert; Psalm 86.2.
but mercy received does both humble and mollify the heart. The godly man
having obtained mercy and grace from God, is again holy, pious, kin^ and
merciful to others. It is the commandment of God, Deuteronomy. ^5.7.
Thou shall not make strong thy heart, nor shut up the bowels of compassion
from thy needy brother: But evermore the frame of a believing heart is
correspon^ent to the will and pleasure of God: for faith sets the stamp and
Image of God upon the soul* Moreover, it disposes the heart to thankfulness
and obedience: for it disposes spiritual emptiness, which gives a sweet
r^l^^^h to the me^cie^ of God: and excluding all boasting in o^r selves,
stirs up to glory in the Lord, and willingly t^ deuote our selves unto his
service, from whom we hau^ received whatsoever we enjoy. Psalm. 116.12, 13.
What shall I render to the Lord for all his mercies toward me? I will take
the cup of salvation and call upon the Name of the Lord. Men look for thanks
for a small kindness; for a token, a dinner, if they write but a letter,
speak a word, take a journey in our behalf: Faith reads the name of God in
all his mercies, and seriously calls them to remembrance, what then can it
do less then magnify the Name of God for all his goodness? The mercies of
God to a believing heart, are as manure to sound and good soil, which makes it
more fertile. Satan himself will confess, that God is specially to be served
in the days of prosperity, Job 1.9, 10.
for when God asked him, Have thou considered my servant Job, a just man, etc.
He replieth, Does Job fear God for naught? Have thou not made an hedge about
him? And faith does both remember man of his duty, and persuade him to be so
much the more serviceable and obedient, as the mercies of God are powered upon
him more plentifully. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
Psalm 116.9.
When the Churches had r^st throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria,
they were edified, Acts 9.31.
and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost,
were multiplied.

Psalm. 33.16.
The Creatures themselves have no power to help, can profit nothing unless
God put forth his hand to bless them for our use. This makes that the requests
of faith be not formal and perfunctorie, but effectual, fervent, arising
from a true consideration of the weakness and impotencie of the creature to
sustain and uphold us. And thus to live by faith in the abundance of all
things: makes way for patience, contentedness, sound peace in the depth of
misery, when we be left naked and destitute of all humane aid. For if when we
enjoy means we lean not upon them, but upon the Lord; when they are taken
away we shall not fall; our stay remaining.



conscious of our own weakness, and of the snare that i^ in eu^ry creature to
take and entangle us. Prosperity is pleasing but dangerous. Children quickly
surfeit on sweet m^ats: Coezening comp^nions give flattering speeches. Long
peace begets idl^nesse: Poverty is more fertile of men: plenty of riot,
niceness, ease and such like. Blustering winds cannot pull the cloak from
the traveler, who casts it off in the heat of the Sun. We have examples of
many great worthies, who have caught much hurt in prosperity. Rest has
effeminated many Captains, who could never be crushed or overcome with the
^errours of war. Soft sands swallow more ships, then hard rocks split
asunder. This makes the waking belieuer circumspect to examine his heart, and
watch over it, how he performs holy duties, how he entertaines holy thoughts,
how his affections move toward that which is above, lest he should miscarrie
upon the sands.

Job 3.25, 26.
The thing that I greatly feared (says Job) is come upon me, and that which I
was afraid of is come unto me. I was not in safety, neither had I rest,
neither had I quiet: I always thought upon my change, and looked for an
alteration of mine estate. The longest day has night at length entering: yea,
there is no wind which may not blow rain, if God be so pleased. Estates which
have the longest periods of prosperity, be at length exercised with
afflictions: and there is no condition so sure and peaceable, but may turn
tempestuous on the sudden, should not God be more gracious. This being in it
self apparent, and confirmed by infinite examples, cannot be hid from the
piercing eye of faith, which is spiritually wise to discern aforehand, what
events we are subject unto in this vale of tears. Nature by instinct gives
unto unreasonable Crea^ures a faculty which makes them aforehand
apprehensiue of that which is ready to ensue. The wisdom which is from above,
m^keth the Lords ch^ldren sensible in like kind, that as Job, so they in their
g^eatest calm foresee how ^ods hand may change for their exercise. Nor does
faith only fore^ee danger, but prepare for it. Prou. 22.3. and 27.12.
The wise man sees the plague and hides himself. The belieuer has learned
by due consideration, how wanting he is in wisdom, and weak in st^ength to
stand when God tries, an^ so renouncing his wit and strength, he flies unto
God and holds him, as he who has been, is, and must be for ever his
salvation: and looks unto Christ the Author and finisher of our faith, who
has received ^ommandem^nt of the Father, that he should not only ^all us and
bring v^ into the state of grace, but also raise us up at the last day: who is
that great God and Savior, who will keep his from every evil work unto his
hea^enly kingdom.

Th s matter may be exemplified in some particular, How to live by faith in
the use of meat and drink.

resting upon Christ for salvation, and giving himself unto the study, and
sincere, impartial practice of holiness; the food must be lawfully gotten,
provided with wise respect of our place and m^anes, without distracting care,
or exquisite curiosity and niceness, received with thanksgiving as from Gods
han^, and used as in his sight and presence, for such ends and purposes as he
has appointed.

Psalm. 104.21. and 145.15. Psalm. 23.5. Hosea 2 18, 19. Ezekiel. 37.24, 25
as gifts of the gracious covenant, proceeding from the free love of God. For
in the covenant of grace God promises not only to write his Law in our h^arts,
and to forgive our sins, but also to confer temporal blessings, as they
shall be serviceable to us in our journey tow^rds Heaven. Men that make a great
purchase, desire to have some part in present possession: and our gracious God
making p^omise of etern^ll happiness, does give earthly blessings in hand as
pertaining to that heavenly possession, which we shall enjoy hereafter. Now as
God gives temporal things to his people in couen^nt, so does faith receive
them as ^okens of special good will and favor in Jesus Christ, Heb. 1.2. and
2.8
in and through whom of free grace, sonne-like right and ti^le to the creatures
is resto^ed, which by sin and disob^dience was forfeited. And these
considerations strike the heart with reverence, inflame it with love, and raise
an holy regard and care not to abuse this grant of mercy, breeds an
acknowle^gement of our unworthiness of any mercy, Genesis 32.10.
admirat^on of Gods provision and contentation with the least blessing of God.

Deuteronomy 8.3. Math. 4.4.
but by the providence of God, and his blessing upon his own ordinance. It is
not the nature of the thing it self simply to nourish; if Gods blessing be
not upon it, Psalm. 104.15.
it can afford no refreshing. Bread strengthens, wine comforts the heart by his
ordinance and application of them to that use: but the blessing is not in the
creature, it comes from above. Bread nourishes when it is Gods hand or means
to confer strength and vigor: but if he pluck away his hand, it is but a
deaf nut. Thou may eat and not be filled; Hosea 4.10. Hag. 1.5, 6. Mich.
6.14, 15. Psalm. 106.15.
drink be and not satisfied. Thus it is noted of the Israelites, The Lord fed
them with Manna, but sent leanness into their souls. This persuasion sinking
deep into the believing heart, takes it off the creature, and lifts it unto
the Lord in earnest and pertinent prayer, that he would of his grace vouchsafe
unto us, 1. Tim. 4.4.
as leave to use his creatures, so his blessing upon them, that the food we
receive may do us good, we feeling the nourishing virtue thereof, and that
with joy and cheerfulness. The prayer of faith for Gods blessing upon the
creatures when they are set before us should be no less earnest, then for the
mercies themselves if wanting. For there is no more possibility in meat of it
self to nourish without Gods blessing, then it is for man to live without
meat.

Beza annot mayor. in 1. Tim. 4.5. Hosea 2.9.
And this is the best sauce to all meats, which gives them the daintiest
relish. When we sit down to meat, we come to a lively Sermon of Gods bounty
and love: for the bread we feed upon is not ours, but the Lords, all the
provision are gifts of his mercy in Jesus Christ. Calvin. in Psalm. 8 Verse 8.
Moller. ibid.
And the more sensible the creatures are, the more pleasant and delightsome to
our palate, the more should we be affected with the sense of Gods love and
favor.

Titus 2.11.
and faith receiving this word works sobriety in earthly things, refreshing
the soul with spiritual sweetnesses, and watching against intemperate
cherishings that they win not ground. As a man that has took in the taste
of the best creatures, cannot forthwith feed on that which is coarse, ^ant.
1.2. Psalm. 119.72.^0^. Psalm. 36.9. Ier 31 14. Psalm. 63.3, 6.
mean, no way to be compar d: so a Christian who by faith has tasted the love
of God, which is be^ter then wine, the comforts of the word, which are sweeter
then honey to the mouth, he cannot affect (as sometimes before he did) those
sensual delights which carnal men (who know no better) follow with
greed^nesse. If earthly delights creep vp^n us, it is because the exercise of
faith is neglected, which must conscionably be renewed again. Moreover, a
Christian belieuer comes to his Table with an holy Jealousy, remembering that a
snare is laid for him in every creature. Satan is a cunning fowler, who has
his baits laid secretly to catch us, where we least suspect. The Snake lurketh
in the fairest grass: and the most dangerous grins are set in our lawful
liberties. And through neglect to keep up our watch, these often take, when
others miss. More perish through the abuse of things lawful, then by the
practice of what is simply unlawful. They are spots in the feasts of Charity,
Inde verse 12. Matthew. 24.38, ^9.
who feed without fear. Eating, drinking, building, matter of marriage, the
world shall be drowned in these, when Christ comes to Judgment. How many times
do the best offend in lawful things? The pleasure we take in these things,
Job 1.5.
how insensibly does it steal the heart away from spi^ituall delights? how
does it indispose the frame of the soul to heavenly exercises? how does it
cherish wrath, Prou. 23.1, 2, 3.
and foster unbridled passions? Dainty meats are very dangerous and
deceitful: for the sensible delight they give, whereby the appetite is
inordinately moved after them, does press down the soul that it cannot mount
aloft in spiritual contemplation: These evils faith does wisely foresee and
watch to prevent.

Deuteronomy. 8.10* 1 Timothy 4 4,
as by prayer for a blessing. The creatures are not ours, but the Lords* we
must not meddle with them before we have craved leave: and when we have made
use of them for supply of our necessity, we must not forget to return praise.
If men borrow ought of their neighbor, when they bring it home, they forget
not to give thanks. Great is the misery of man if he want these outward
comforts: and the greater our misery without them, the more ^ncomprehensible
is the Lords mercy in supplying our n^cessitie. The providence of God in
ministr ng daily food is no less wonderful, then was his feed^ng of Israel in
the wilderness with M^nna and Quails from Heaven: for as we are not fed as
they were, so ^re we preserved from their necessity. That the earth should
yield her increase for our daly sustenance, so as we feel no extremity, is
it not as great a blessing, as to be supplied from Heaven, when we are brought
into distress? who would not choose rather never to be sick, then to recover
by miracle? what man would no^ rather enjoy the constant benefit of eyesight,
then to be restored after long blindness? Besides, they be not simply
favors which for the present sustain nature, but they are some small pittance
of our child's portion, pawnes of our heavenly inheritance: which does add much
unto their sweetness. If friends be absent, a letter, a token serves much to
maintain love and kindness: now these be some of those loue-tokens, which our
heavenly Father sends unto us, that he might draw our love unto him.

John 6.12. Amos 6.6. Esaias 5.12.
at ordinary meals it remembers the affliction of Joseph, regards the work
of the Lord, and consi^ereth the operation of his h^nds. For the mercies of God
received by faith do leave an imp ession of his mercy upon the soul: and so
our compassion toward others is increased as the mercies of God are multiplied
upon us. Daily refreshing renueth the continual remembrance of our
infirmities, and begetteh a lively sense of the miseries o^ them that want and
stand in need. And when vigor of M^nde an^ body is repaired, it sets us
about the work and business, whereunto we are ^ppointed of God. God gives
none food to live idle. Men look for work from them to whom they give meat,
drink and wages: and shall not we labor in the work of God, who live daily
on his allowance.

CHAP. IX.
What it is to live by faith touching the Commandments: which God has given
for direction of our lives, according to which we ought to walk.

IN the word of grace the Lord calls for universal, voluntary, sincere,
uniform, constant obedience; and promises both to ^nable his Children to do
what is pleasing, and to accept of their willing, though weak service. The
first of these branches is apparent and well known to them that be any whit
exercised in the word; the second has been proved at large already:
nevertheless that weak Christians might have in readiness some grounds of
faith in these particulars, it will not be s^perfluous to point to some
passages of Scripture where they may see them confirmed. The Lord calls for
willing; cheerful, universal, unfeigned, constant obedience. Genesis 17.1. Exodus
19.5.
That Christians are bound to serve God willingly and cheerfully without
constraint, universally in holiness, and righteousness, unfeignedly as in his
sight all the days of their life, constantly in all estates unto the end, these
few texts may be sufficient to p^oue. I am the Almighty God, walk before me,
and be thou perfect. If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people. Deuteronomy. 5.29.
and 6.2.
O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep
my commandments always that it might be well with them, Deuteronomy. 6.17.
and with their Children for ever. You shall diligently keep the Commandments
of the Lord your God. ^f thou shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the
Lord thy God, Deuteronomy. 28.1.
to ^bseru^ and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day,
the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth. Take
diligent heed to do the commandment and the l^w which Moses the servant of
the Lord charged you, Josh. 22.5. and 23.8. and 24.14. 1 Chro. 28.9.
to love the Lord your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to ke^pe his
Commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart,
and withal your soul. Blessed are they that keep judgment, Psalm. 106.3.
and he that does justice at all times. To this end are we delivered out of the
h^nds of our enemies, Luke 1.74.75.
that we might serve him without fear, in holin^sse and righteousness before
him all the days our life. Pro 23.17.
Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long. And look what service the
Lord does expect and call for, Psalm. 25.12.
that he will enable his people in covenant to perform. What man is he that
fears the Lord, him will he teach in the way that he shall choose. Deuteronomy. 30.6.
The Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed to the
love Lord thy God with all thy heart and withal thy soul, that thou may
live. Verse 8.
Ieremi. 24.7.
And thou shall return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his
commandments which I command thee this day. And I will give them an heart to
know me, that I am the Lord, Ezekiel. 11.19.
and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return
unto me with their whole heart. And I will put a new Spirit within you, and I
will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of
flesh. I will save them out of their dwelling places, Ezekiel. 37.23.24.
wh^rein they have sinned, and will cleanse them, so shall they be my people,
and I will be their God. And David my servant shall be king over them, and they
shall all have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and
ob^erue my statutes and do them. In that day sing ye unto her. A vineyard of
red wine. I the Lord do keep it, and will water it every moment: lest any
hurt it, I will keep it night and day. Isay 27.2.3.
Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength. Isay.
45.24.
Those, that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts
of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age* Psalm. 92.13.14.
Romans 6.14.
they shall be fat and fl^urishing. Sin shall not have dominion oue^ you.
Now we are d^liu red fro the law, that being dead wherein we were held, Romans
7.6.
that we should serve in newn^s of Spirit, and not in oldnes of the letter I
can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. Phil. 4 13. The
Christians obedience is imperfect, but pleasing. Pro. 12.22. Psalm. 147.11.
Psalm. 149.4.
The obedience of the faithful which through the power of grace they perform,
is weak and imperfect, but pleasing and acceptable unto God. The Lord takes
pleasure in them that fear him: in those that hope in his mercy. The Lord
takes pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. In
every nation he that fears God and works righteousness, is accepted of
him. The Lord by Moses did often times tell his people that they offering up
their sacrifices, Act. 10.35.
such as he commanded, they should be accepted: which is often repeated by the
p^ophets. Leu. 1.3.4. and 22.21. and 23.11.
Thou shall mak^ a plate of pure gold and grave upon it like the engrauings of
a s^gnet, Holiness to the Lord; and it shall be upon Aarons forehead, that Aaron
may bear the iniquity of the holy things which the children of Israel shall
hallow in all their holy gifts, Exodus 28.36.38.
and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before
the Lord. Esaias. 60.7.
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together, the Rams of Nebaioth
shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar. The
Priest shall make you burnt offerings upon the alter, and your peace offerings,
Ezekiel. 43.27, and 20, 40, 41.
and I will accept you, says the Lord God. Then shall the offerings of Judah
and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in
former years. Mal. 3.4.
Then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness; with burnt
offering, and whole burnt offering. Psalm. 51.19.
Hereunto may be referred the prayer of the prophet. Let the words of my mouth,
and the meditation o^ my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength,
Psalm. 19.14.
and my r^deemer. Accept I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
Lord, and teach me thy Iudgem^nt^. Psalm. 119.108. Deuteronomy. 33.11.
There be many other testimonies to the same purpose. I b seech you therefore
brethren, by the mercies of Go^, that ye present your bodies a living
sacrifice holy, acceptable unto God. Romans 12.1. Phil. 4.18.
I am full having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you,
an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wel-pleasing to God. But to
do good, and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well
pleased. Ye also, Heb. 13.16. 1. Pet. 2.5.
as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, an holy Preisthood, to offer
up spiritual sacrifice, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Children obey your
parents in all things, Col. 8.20. Heb. 11.5.
for this is well pleasing. Before his translation Enoch had received this
testimony, that he pleased God.

And this faith is most necessary to the leading of a Christian life, Faith is
necessary to the leading of a Christian life.
scil. to adhere and stick fast unto the commandments, rest upon God for
ability to do what he requires, and that he will accept what sincere and
unfeigned service, though weak and imperfect, is tendered unto his Highness.
For the word of grace, which commands to believe the free mercy of the Lord
to the pardoning of sin, Tit. 2.11.12.
teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lust, and to live godly, justly
and soberly in this present evil world. Such as give up their names to Christ,
must not look to be lawless; but they come to take a yo^ke upon them, Math.
11.28.29 Ioh. 13.34.
and stand obliged to fulfill the law of Christ, called the new Commandment.
Want of believing the precepts is the cause why many do still continue in the
practice of diverse things inconvenient, and suffer inordinate passions to hold
them under. Ignorance or carelessness in this point, is the cause, why some of
the better sort of people are off and on, now forward then backward, scarce
settled or stayed at any time: not knowing how to set upon the practice of
repentance; how to begin or to proceed therein: Whereas this faith much
avails to the furthering of the dear Children of God in a godly course, the
sh^ning of evil, and the practice of holiness. True faith is an obsequious
confidence, which carries a man whither soever he shall see the Lord to g^e
before him. Heb. 11.5.7.8.9.10. etc.
By faith H^noch walked with God; Noah builded an Arc; Abraham offered up his
s^nne Isaac: Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter. Our
present faith or trust in God is but commensurable to our fideli^ie in his
Comma^ndements: ere we can make a faithful plea for mercy, Gods will
neglected must be executed, either in act, if the ob^ect be present, and may
be prosecuted; or in sincere and constant resolution, if abilities and
opportunities required to execution of what we resolve upon, be altogether
wanting, or our endeauours upon inevitable occasions hindered. Gal. 5.6.
Faith works by love, which constrains men to do the will of God, and
submit themselves to his holy Commandments. The strength of faith to it
several objects is uniform, that assurance of forgiveness cannot be greater
then care of obedience. The very consciousnesse of any one sin whereunto we
have been indulgent; will be of like force to withdraw our assent from Gods
mercy, as the delight or pleasure of that sensual object, was to cause us to
transgress any part of his will revealed. The same strength, beauty had to
allure unto adultery, will that foul sin unrepented of, have to divorce our
souls from Christ. Nor can we fail in practice of this or other
Commandment, without a precedent defect of that faith, which only can firmly
unite us unto Christ: whereby likewis^ were it firm it self, we should
assent unto every precept of God as much better then any incompatible good.
That act cannot please God; which is not animated by faith: for it is but the
naked carkese of a good work, without life or soul, if that be wanting. It is
faith, which impelleth to work righteousness, and puts life and vigor
into the work wrought: so that the best works of the regenerate be dull and
liuelesse, if faith be dormant, and put not forth it self for a time. And when
a Christian knows not, whether he shall have strength to do what God
requires; nor whether God has given him any promise, that his burden shall be
made light and that Christ will bear the greatest part of it for him, it must
needs be very tedious and troublesome; it will occasion many fears and
doubts, deadness and vnchearefulnesse. This kills the heart of right good
Christians, when they are ignorant, or not thoroughly informed, that God will
make them able and fit for so great a work, as the leading of a godly life.
But if they have this faith as a foundation to uphold them, they shall sooner
wade through their doubts, and grow out of their fears, as knowing that God
will be ever with them for their assistance. Who does not know, that when some
certainty of salvation is obtained, yet for all that in as much as it is but
weak, they have many heart-griefes for this, that they see they have a
wearisome pilgrimage to go through, and little knowledge and persuasion of any
great guiding of them through all the fears and difficulties of it? A
Christian that has this confidence, that God will strengthen him to every good
work, he shall go about it with heart and cherefulnesse; he shall be
encouraged to pray as his necessity shall give cause, he shall be kept from
fainting and dismaidnes, when his strength is not very great, and rise up
again when he is fallen. But if he be not well grounded in believing, that God
will build him up more strongly from day to day; and perfect the good work in
him which is begun, he shall very much stagger and go back. If a chief
and maine post in a building be wanting, will not the whole house be soon
sh^ken, so if a Christian, who must reform his life, go about it, not resting
upon the grace of God in Christ to be made able, he may be sure he shall want
a maine h^lpe hereto, even that which may shake all that is set up. Sundry
true-hearted Christians, very Conscionable in their conversation, be yet much
discouraged by reason of the infirmities of their best duties, and have little
comfort in any thing they do, because they question what accep^ance their
poor service has with God. And though they desire to please him willing, in
all things to live honestly, Heb. 13.18.
yet still looking upon their frailties, they hardly admit any comfort, because
they come so far short of what is required. Whereas, if they were well
instructed and assured of this, that although by reason of their cor^uption
dwelling in them, they can never offer up any sacrifice to God without blemish
and spot (for which God might reject all, which they offer unto him) yet
offering them up in the Name of Christ they shall be accepted and rewarded;
this would put life and courage into them, and make them perform all holy
duties with more cheerfulness and constancy, to the glory of God, the
comfort of their souls, and the good encouragement of others. Confidence in
God to be accepted, what tedious disputes would it remove? What temptations
would it cut off? What discouragements would it trample under feet? What
strength, vigor, resolution and forwardness in well-doing would it nourish and
conserve? The sharpest spur to incite unto and encourage to go forward in
the works of holiness, is affiance of favorable acceptance.

Christians are allowed to believe that God will enable to obedience. Ier.
32.39, 40.
Every Christian is allowed to believe that God will strengthen him by his grace
to walk in obedience, and make him able through the hearing of the Scriptu^es
to cast off his old conversation. For God has promised in Covenant that he
will teach them the way that they shall choose, guide them with his eye, and put
his fear into their hearts, that they shall not depart from his Commandments.
The Spirit of grace is promised and given to all true and unfeigned Belieuers,
to lead them into all truth an^ holiness. As many as be the children of God,
Romans 8.14.
they are led by the Spirit of God; and the law of the Spirit of life, in Jesus
Christ, Verse 2.
has freed them from the law of sin an^ death. The Lord when he sends
forth his servants upon any message or business, does evermore promise to be
with them to aid and assist them in the execution of it. Thus the Lord
promised to Moses, Go, Exodus 4.12. Math. 28.19, 20
and I will be wit^ thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shall say. Thus our
Savior to his Disciples, Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the
world. 1. Chron. 28.20. Ier. 1.7, 8. Josh. 1.9.
And thus David encouraged his Son Solomon, Be strong and of good courage,
and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, even, my God, will be
with thee; he will not fail thee nor forsake thee, until thou have finished
all the work for the service of the house of the Lord. And the same promise
belongs to them, that yield obedience to his Commandments: for the work is
his, and he will not fail nor forsake them, that set their hearts and souls
to seek him, and do the thing that is good in his fight. Whatsoever the
Saints have and may beg in prayer according to the will and pleasure of God,
they are allowed to believe that they shall obtain it, and be answered in
their requests with favorable acceptance, so far as shall be for their
good, and the glory of God: But the servants of God have and do beg grace
to bring forth fruits worthy repentance and amendment of life. Psalm. 119.32, 33
I will run the race of thy Commandments, when thou shall enlarge mine
heart. Teach me the way of thy statutes, O Lord, and I shall keep it unto the
end. Make me to go in the paths of thy Commandments, Verse 35.
for therein do I delight. Teach me thy way, O Lord, Psalm. 86.11.
I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy Name. Lead me in thy
truth, and teach me: Psalm. 25.5. Psalm. 17.5.
for thou art the God of my salvation, on the^ do I wait all the day. Hold up
my goings in thy paths, that my footst^ps slip not. Psalm. 27.11.
Teach ^e thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path because of mine
enemies. The faithful have bound themselves by covenant and oath to keep the
righteous judgments of the Lord. Psalm. 119.106. Nehem. 10.29. 2. Kings 23.3.
Psalm. 119.8. Verse 36.
I have sworn, and I will p^rforme it that I will keep thy righteous
judgments. But they came not to this covenant and oath, as trusting in their
own strength, but in assurance of divine assistance; as the Prophet prays, I
will ke^pe thy statut^s, O forsake me not utterly. Incline my heart unto thy
testimonies, and not to covetousness. Order my steps in thy word, and let not
any iniquity have dominion over me. Verse 133. Verse 135.
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant, and teach me thy statutes. God will
perfect the saving work, which he has begun in any of his children: for the
gifts that flow from his eternal and free grace are without repentance. God
who calls us according to his purpose is faithful, who will also confirm us
unto the end, 1. Cor. 1.8, 9. Phil. ^.6. 1 These. 5.24. Gal 2.20. Phil. 4 13.
that we may be blameless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul says, he
lived by faith in the Son of God, by whom he was strengthened with ability
to perform whatsoever was required of him. Notwithstanding all the hope of
help that he had, yet he complains of the rebellion of his flesh, Romans
7.19.
which did m^ghtily resist the Spirit in him: But still he was confident in the
promise of God, that he should be delivered from every evil work, 2. Tim. 4.18.
and preserved unto the heavenly kingdom Now in all this Paul had no peculiar
prerogative above other Christians: but what he expected from God, they may all
hope f^r. Acts of faith touching obedience requiquir^d.
The acts of faith touching that obedience which we owe unto God in Christ are
these or the like.

David says, he was wiser then his Enemies, Psalm. 119.97, 9, 99.
then his Teachers then the Ancient: and he ^^nder^ the cause thereof from the
work of his faith; Psalm 119.24.
for thy testimonies are ever with me, they are my meditation, and the men of
my counsel with whom I ad^ise.

and allurements to the contrary. 1. John 5.4.
This is the victory whereby we overcome the world, even our faith. For faith
being wel-rooted, possessing the heart, and having its force united by close
reposall therein, comman^s every delight, affection, or pleasure of our souls,
and breaks the violence of every inclination contrary to such motion as it
suggests; seeing no hopes can be equal to the reward which it proposes to the
constant and resolute, no fears compar^ble to the terrors which it represents
to the negl^gent or slothful followers of such courses as it pres^r^bes. What?
Phil. 3.8.
that faith sets an inestimable price upon the pearl of the Gospel,
accounting all other things as dross an^ dung in comparison, which causes a
free and advised renouncing of all interest in the world, the flesh, Math.
13.44.
and all their appurtenances, for assurance of it, with as great willingness
as good husbands fors^ke base tenements, and hard-rented leases, to compass
some goodly royalty and large possessions, offered them more then half for
nothing. Again, faith fights against temptations and inti^ements unto sin
by the power of Christ, which cannot be vanquished. Satan and the world are too
strong for us, standing in our own might: but by the grace of God, le^ning
upon his power, we remain invincible. The strength of nature is corrupt,
feeble, and defiled through sin; and therefore the truth which it takes hold
off, it has not effectually. But faith has joined with it the inspiration of
God, and the power of the holy Ghost, and therefore it takes hold of the truth
eff^ctually. Wherefore this difference is not in the truth it self, but in the
mean and instrument whereby we embrace it. Hereof it comes, that by faith
we are chang^d, but in the other case we remain the selfsame that we were
before. A clear testimony of this we h ue in the Gospel. Christ set forth
to the young man, what he should do to obt^ine salvation: but when he heard,
he was not p^rswad^d to obey, but went away sorrowfu^l. Math. 19.22.
Contrariwise Matthew, Math. 9.9.
so soon as he was called, embraced the same with so great faith, that h^e
left his money and Customer-ship, and st^aight-way followed Christ. Luke 19.8.
And Zacheus when he had heard of the Lord, that he would turn in unto him,
he not only received him into his house with a glad heart, but also offered
immediately to distribute half his goods to the poor, and to restore
fourfold, if he had defrauded any man. Indeed p^ssions are not so bridled,
nor corruptions so killed that they do not stir, and resist the work of
faith: But the force and power of them is so far subdued, that they shall not
reign, or hale us ordinarily to that which is evil. Whatsoever
inordin^tenesse faith can epsy, it does presently condemn before the throne
of grace, and endeavor the killing of it by the power and efficacy of Christ's
death, which it does happily effect in measure and by degrees. Have thou then
been long kept under of some violent passion, strong corruption, or customarie
vice, against which thou have resolved and resolved, but not prevailed or
gotten victory? Get thee to Christ, and by faith thou shall draw virtue from
him to cure thy infirmities. Die to thy self, renounce the broken reed of
thine own free will, which has so often deceived thee: and put all thy trust
in the grace of Christ, and it will crucify the old man, and give him his
deaths wound. Be weak in thy self, and strong in the Lord, and through faith
thou shall be more then conqueror. Dig up the fallow ground of thy heart,
that the word of the Kingdom may take deeper root in it, raise thy soul to an
holy admiration of the promises of life, stir up thy self to cleave and
adhere firmly to the grace of God: as faith increases, the power of
corruption will languish and decrease. Admirable is the efficacy of faith well
planted in the heart, it casts down strong holds, and brings every
imagination into s^biection.

Thirdly, It inableth to obey: for it purifieth the heart, seasoneth every
faculty of soul reasonable and sensual, qualifieth and st^engtheneth our
natural inclinations to good, and alters the taste of every appetite. 2.
Pet. 1.4. Ephesians. 3.17. 1. John 4.4.
By faith we are partakers of the divine nature: by faith Christ dwells in
our hearts: by faith we receive the Spirit of promise, who is greater then he
that is in the world: No marvel then, if that be sweet and delightful to the
believing heart, which is tedious and irksome to the unregenerate. How came
David to that high delight in Gods service, that he loved the Commandments of
God more then thousands of gold and silver, the honey and the honey comb? That
he rose at midnight to meditate in them, was it not by faith? The grace of
Christ, the power of the Spirit, and the Word of life, do change the
disposition of the soul; so far as they enter and be received into it. But
by faith their virtue is diffused into the whole mass.

O my soul why do thou not resign thy self to the pleasure of his will in
every thing, run when he calle^h, and do what he requires at thy hands?
Wh^t do thou fear? Wherewith art thou entangled? God is thy sovereign, thy
F^ther, thy Savior; to him thou owe thy self, and all that thou have: thy
honor, wealth, life, or if any thing be more precious then these. Thou can
not love thy self as is meet, if thou ^enie not thy self to follow the Lord
in all things. For in keeping his Commandments there is great reward. Can, or
did any Belieuer ever give the nay to these m^lting commands, or commanding
entreaties of faith? Will it take the repuls^? Does it not constrain or extort
more then all rackes and strapadoes; allure more then all wages and prizes?
When thou would be sure to speed and obtain any thing of thine own
untoward heart, set faith on work to make the motion, and thou shall prevail.
For the motives of faith are certain, evident, and such as cause firm assent,
whereby the heart is drawn to follow after the thing proposed.

Deuteronomy. 30.20. and 11.22. 2. Kings 18.6. Josh. 23.8. Acts 11.23. Psalm. 119.31.
Heb. 11 5.33.
It acknowledges his soueraignetie, assenteth faithfully to his will and
pleasure, embraces soundly every part of the holy truth of God, and sticks
so fast that nothing can come betwixt the heart and it: from whence issues
universal respect to all and every precept. Faith does not admit one part of
the Word and exclude another: nor receive it barely into the Head, and shut it
forth of the heart: but entertaineth it wholly, diffuseth the ^ertue of it into
every power of the soul, and changes the natural disposition into the quality
of the truth. And thus by faith the soul is kindly disposed to follow the
Lord, whithersoeuer he goes before us. If the heart be dull and untoward,
the best course to redress what is out of order, is by quickening our assent
to the good pleasure of his command, and our confidence in his mercy.

Cant 8.7, 8.
that in comparison of obedience it contemns the whole world. For it
acquainteth with the incomprehensible mercy and favor of God toward us in
giving his Son, pardoning and forgiving manifold offenses, lading us with his
daily blessings: It represents the inestimable joy, that is prepared for them
that walk before God in holiness and righteousness: and this enflameth the
heart to follow hard after the Lord. Psalm. 63.8.
When by faith we discern what love the Lord bears unto us, we cannot but
return love for love. Luke 7.47.
Many sins are forgiven her therefore she loves much. And from all these
acts it follows, That what a temporary belieuer does by the halues,
^^perficially, or with an halting divided heart, that the true and unfeigned
belieuer takes in hand with an entire, sound, upright affection. What in the
one is a liuelesse action, the outside, or carcass of a good work; that in
the other is a good work indeed, springing from an holy, wel-planted
confidence in the mercy of God, and resolute adherence to his Commandments,
which (as the animal faculty) impels to that exercise. The selfsame duties
may be done by the civil man and by the belieuer for the outside and deed
done: both may go to Church, hear a Sermon, read a Chapter, give an Alms,
make a Prayer; but the one goes as a Bear to the stake in comparison of the
other, who is moved by faith: or let the civil man's delight be as it may, his
acts are liuelesse, because they issue not from an obedientiall confidence in
the Lords mercy.



Acts 16.14, Psalm. 119.15. Psalm. 119.11.
I have hid or treasured up thy Commandments in my heart, that I might not
sin against thee. And to this purpose, a belieuer will not be negligent to
watch all opportunities, when his soul is thoroughly affected with unexpected
matter of sorrow, Luke 1.65 66. and 2.51.
joy, grief, fear, admiration, or the like, and forthwith to apply such
passages of Scripture, as suit best to the present affections.

Psalm. 119.106. John 15.6.
I have sworn, and will perform it (trusting upon thy divine grace, without
which we can do nothing) that I will keep thy righteous Judgments.

Psalm. 119.18. Verse 5.
Open thou mine eyes that I may behold the wondrous things out of thy law. O
that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes. Verse 10.
With my whole heart have I sought thee, Verse 28. Psalm. 17.5. 1. Chron. 29.18,
19.
O let me not wander from thy Commandments. My soul melts for heaviness:
strengthen thou me according to thy word. Hold up my goings in thy paths, that
my footsteps slip not.

against the strongest lusts, and set upon the practice of the most difficult
duties, notwithstanding all opposition from the World or the Devil; yea,
though we have been foiled, or taken the repulse. He will not fear the
subduing of the most headstrong passion, who rests upon God for power and
ability, nor be dismayed because once he has received a foil, who depends
upon God for strength to recover; nor dread the might of his greatest
adversary, who knows that God will be at his right hand to sustain and
strengthen him; nor start aside in the most difficult duty, whose heart is
fast linked unto the Lord; and relieth upon his grace to be enabled unto
whatsoever he is pleased to call him. Heb. 11.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15.
By faith Abraham soiourned in the land of promise, and minded not to return
to his natiu^ Country, though he had opportunity. By faith, Verse 17, 18.
being tried of God he offered up Isaac: and he that had received the
promises, offered up his only begotten Son. By faith some were tortured, not
accepting deliverance, some stoned, some slain with the sword: Verse 35, 36.
Faith encourages to constancy in well-doing, by assuring of Gods all-seeing
presence, powerful protection, continual assistance, gracious acceptance,
good success, and everlasting recompense: Be strong in the Lord, Ephesians. 6.10.
and in the power of his might. Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, Psalm.
27.14. and 31.24. Esaias 50 7.
and he shall strengthen thine heart. For the God will help me, therefore
shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like flint, and I know
that I shall not be confounded. Heb. 13.13, 14.
Let us go forth therefore unto him without the Camp, bearing his reproach.
For here we have no continuing City, but we seek one to come. By faith
Moses did choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, Heb. 11.25,
26.
then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of
Christ greater riches then the treasures of Egypt: for he had r^spect unto the
recompense of reward. But faith that continually drives forward to do good
works, does ever force the belieuer to deny himself, and acknowledge it to
be the mercy of the Lord in Christ, that he is not confounded. Though a man
be plentifully laden with good wo^kes; yet faith does ever present him before
the throne of grace as poor and miserable, desiring of mere mercy to be
received and accepted: It confesses the manifold imperfections of our best
works, acknowledges every grace and good work to be of God, and never
looks to works further then as they be signs of grace, effects of faith,
and qualifications of that subject, which makes faithful plea to the Kingdom
of Heaven, through the free mercy of God in Jesus Christ.

Means to quicken our selves to the practice of obedience.
But how should a Christian quicken faith to the cheerful practice of that
duty, whereunto he finds himself dull and sluggish?

Ier 48.^0. Mal. 1.14.
Cursed is the man that does the work of the Lord negligently, who has a male
in his flock, and offers the halt or lame unto the Lord. What is my portion
if I should be dealt with in justice, who have neglected my duty, and
sacrificed that which is torn and sick unto the great King and Lord of hosts,
whose name is dreadful among the Heathen? It is hateful in a servant to do
his work by the halues: specially if he owe himself unto his Master for
undeserved kindnesses: Whatsoever I am, I have received it of the Lord: all
possible duty that can be performed of a reasonable creature, I owe unto him;
he has obliged me unto his highness by many great, undeserved,
incomprehensible mercies, that I am never able to repay, or sufficiently to
acknowledge: and in me it is most abominable that I have been halting and
deceitful in what he commands. Can any man deserve that duty from another,
that thou, O Lord, have and do deserve of me? Can he be in such dependence
unto another, as I am unto thy Majesty, in whom I live, move, have my being;
by whom I am preserved, redeemed, and called unto life? If the idle, untrusty,
deceitful servant merit stripes: my sleightinesse and double dealing in the
exercises of Godliness, is worthy shame and confusion of face for evermore. No
marvel, if I find small comfort in life, feel no power and sweetness in the
ordinances of grace, when I deal partially, hear perfunctorily, pray coldly,
labor not to feed upon the word, and suck vigor out of it. The duties of
courtesy lose their worth and esteem with men, when wrung from us by
importunacie, or followed with a slack hand: Lord, thou love a cheerful
giver, delightest in willing and free-hearted offerings: with what face then
can I present unto thy Majesty, or how should thou take pleasure in that
maimed, corrupt, vnchearefull, superficial, dead service which I perform? In
former times I have served sin and Satan with more willingness, alacrity
and pains: I have been ready to run whither the Devil drove me; I am still
forward to gratify unruly desires with this or that they stand unto, and are
bent upon. What am I but a spiritual adulteress, in that I have yielded the
members of my body as weapons of unrighteousness to do the will of Satan,
and listened to the motions of the flesh, with more readiness to lean unto
them, then hitherto I could give my self unto God in all things to be ruled
and directed by him? O Lord, I am vile, it is of thy unspeakable mercy, that
thou art pleased to look down upon me, or to accept of any service that I
can offer.

God with liveliness. Arise, O my soul, why sleep thou, stir up thy
self with readiness to obey the charge of God in the duties of his wo^ship,
and the works of Mercy and Justice: withstand sin, subdue corruptions,
fight manfully against the temptations of Satan, and the allurements of the
world: Stick fast unto the testimonies of the Lord, and lay his judgments
before thee. For the testimonies of the Lord are wonderful, Psalm. 119.129.
Verse. 9. Verse 138.
his judgments good, righteous and very faithful: his word is very pure; and
his law is the truth. The service of God is perfect freedom: he walks at
liberty, who runs on in obedience. As t^y love to the law is, such shall
thy life be: nothing is hard to a willing mind. Want of affection to the word
of truth, makes the duties commanded to seem irksome and tedious. Love the
Commandments above gold, and obedience will be as pleasant as gain to the
covetous. Look upon the Saints, who have gone before: they endured
imprisonment, loss of liberty, the spoiling of goods, hazard of life with
joy, looking unto the eternal and incomprehensible recompense of reward. Thou
art not called to suffer, but to obey; at least not to suffer such grievous
torments as they did: why do thou then delay, start aside, or go forth
unwillingly? Would thou reign with them, and not labor with them? receive
the price, and not run the race? divide the spoil, and not fight the
battle? In the affairs of this life we love to excel, and out-goe our
fellows; as to be first up, and about our work; to exceed in favor, riches,
honor, wisdom; and in matters of Religion to be dead and lumpish, is it not
abominable? Obedience is no dull service, no dead piece of work, but the way
to blessedness and the crown of glory. Esaias 45.19.
The Lord has not said Seek me in vain. The reward of obedience is certain,
though our woe kes deserve nothing. The Merchant undertakes dangerous adventures
to raise his estate, enrich himself. But what is the gold of India to the
joys of He^uen? a fading possession to an eternal weight of glory? strive to
enter, and go forward in the straiteway that leads unto life. Arise, why
tarriest thou? forget not the high price of thy calling, but contend forward
toward the mark. Heaven is worth all thy labor. We are glad to be
entertained of them, who have a name to be liberal and bountiful to their
attendants; who is to be compared to the Lord our God herein? He is most able,
1. Cor. 2.9.
and best willing to prefer his servants. Eye has not seen, ear has not
heard, it exceeds all humane capacity to conceive, what surpassing glory and
joy the Lord has prepared for them that love him.

Teach me to do thy will, Psalm. 143.10.
for thou art my God; thy Spirit is good; lead me into the land of
uprightness. My desire is to do thy good pleasure, Cant. 1.4.
but of my self I have no ability thereunto: Draw me and I will run after
thee. Psalm. 119.33. 34 35. Verse. 135.
Teach me the way of thy statutes, and I will keep it unto the end. Give me
understanding and I shall ke^pe thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole
heart. Lord thou have commanded me to keep thy testimonies; Psalm. 119.36.
give me I pray thee to do what thou requirest. Incline my heart to thy
statutes, and not to covetousness.

Psalm. 119.93.
He must renew his resolution to walk with God, trusting in his grace. I will
never forget thy precepts for with them thou have quickened me. I have fully
purposed to keep and cleave unto thy Commandments, for they are they joy of
my heart. But, Lord I lean not upon mine own strength, but upon thy grace,
Psalm 119.57.112. Psalm. 119.133.
who g^ueth both to will and to do. Thou art my portion, O Lord, I have said
that I will keep thy words. Order my steps in thy word: and let not any
iniquity have dominion over me.

CHAP. X.
What it is to live by faith in the duties of our vocation.

Christians are allowed to live by faith in the duties of their vocation.
IT is the ordinance of God that men should labor in some honest vocation, for
their private maintenance, and the common good, that is, the benefit and good
estate of mankind: And for encouragement he has promised to protect and bless
them that keep themselves within the limits, and do the works of their
calling with diligence. The texts of Scripture are plain for both. Genesis 2.15.
The Lord God took the man, Genesis 3.19.
and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it, and to keep it. In the
sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.
Ephesians. 4.28.
Let him that stole, steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with
his hands the thing that is good: that he may have to give to him that need^th.
1. Cor. 7.20.
Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called, study to be
quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your one hands, (as we
commanded you) that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without. 1 Thessalonians. 4.11.12 2 Thessalonians. 3.10.11 12. Pro. 10, 4. and 12.27.
For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any man
would not work neither should he eat. The hand of the diligent makes rich.
The substance of a diligent man is pr^tious. Prou. 13.11. Prou. 12.24.
He that gathers by labor shall increase. The hand of the diligent shall
bear rule. See thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before
Kings, Prou. 22.29. Psalm. 91.11.
he shall not stand before mean men. He^ shall give his Angels charge over
thee to keep thee in all thy ways. Now seeing God has comma^nded us to
labor in a calling, prescribed the bonds of our calling and promised his
protection and blessing to our hones^ endeauours, it cannot be questioned
whether we be allowed to live by faith in the duties of our calling. Fo the
exercise of faith is as large as the word whereby it is guided and moderated,
that it neither exceed, nor come hort. When e a work is commanded, faith puts
forth ^^el^e in actio^: where a promise is made, it trusts, el^eth, and
w^iteth for accomplishment. In every honest state and cond tion of life there
is use of faith in both respects: For labo^r is commanded and promise of
blessing is made to them that work according to the will and pleasure of God.
Moreover, God is hereby much glorified, that we commit our selves wholly unto
him, laboring as he has appointed, and depending upon his grace for good
success.

It is necessary we should live by faith, Its necessary to live by faith in
the duties of our vocation.
to prevent the the evils which beset us in our ordinary callings:
covetousness, injustice, impatience, and distracting care. Naturally men are
apt to incumber themselves with superfluous business, and trouble themselves
about the event and success: they content not themselves with their lot and
condition, but desire to heap up riches and increase their substance above
measure: they forecast many things in their heads long before; and know no end
of their cares. The trouble men meet with in the world, begets love of the
world; and whether they be crossed or prosper, the more they be exercised about
the things of this life, the more they follow after them with greediness,
vexation discontent, plotting and devising how to compass their designs,
whether by right or wrong, fr^ud or oppression. The sovereign remedy against
those and other the like mis^heifes, which we are prone to run into, is a
lively faith, which lifts up the heart to better things, then ought is to be
found under the moon, quietly submits unto the good pleasure of God,
commends the success and event of all hon^st endeauours unto his Highness,
and rests upon his grace for present help and future supply in the use of
such means as he has ordained. Without faith it is impossible to please God.
Heb. 11.6.
God is the Author of every honest vocation, and by his appointment men ought
to labor in some particular state or condition of life: but that work is not
acceptable, which is not done in faith. If faith do not quicken, season, and
guide the works of our calling, they are dead and carnal as they come from
us, neitheir begun upon sound ground, nor done in uniform and right manner,
nor directed to a right end. That which should put life into the action is
absent, if faith be lacking. Experience is of great use in a godly life, both
to confirm faith, strengthen hope, preserve love, overcome temptations, and
direct in difficulties. But the ready means to get grounded experience, is to
live by faith in the works of our vocation, and observe how the Lord deals
with us therein according to his word.

The acts of faith in respect of the duties of our calling. Pro. 16.20.
The acts of faith in this particular be these.

First, It informs to make choice of an honest vocation, for which we are
fitted; and into which we may enter, by direct, good and lawful means. He
that understands a matter shall find good, says Solomon: wherein he
teaches, that what business any man takes in hand, he must know it well and
accurately, if he look to finish it honestly and with good success. This
therefore is the rule, by which we are directed in our vocation, that what art
any man knows, he should exercise himself in it. This, as it must be
observed in all arts, sciences, professions, in the family, Commonwealth,
Church, so as every art or profession, is of greater moment in any society
public or private, sacred or prophaine, it is with greater diligence more
studiously to be looked unto. As our calling must be honest, that is,
serviceable to the Church, Commonwealth or private family; and as we must be
gifted for it: so must we enter by lawful and direct means appointed of God,
that we may be assured our calling is of God, and that he will accept of our
service in that estate and condition of life.

Pro. 16.20. Pro. 3.5.6.
Who so trusts in the Lord happy is he. Trust in the Lord with all thine
heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding: In all thy ways
acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. It is hard for a man very
skillful so to withdraw his heart and thought from his skill, as that he do
not wholly rest in it: but faith, looking further then sense or reason is able,
dispossesseth the heart of this carnal confidence, and fixes it upon the Lord
alone. For it acknowledges him only to be the fountain of all good, and
persuades the soul, that unless it rely upon his grace, wisdom, and
strength, he shall bring nothing to pass by his own wisdom, wit and cunning.
Psalm. 127.1.2. Hag. 1.6.9. Eccl. 9.11.
For either he shall not effect what he endeauours, to do by the help and
benefit of his skill: or if he bring it to pass, it shall not succeed or
avail him to those honest uses which he intended. The race is not to to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
riches to men of understanding; nor yet favor to men of skill.



Psalm. 128.2. Ephe. 6.5, 6.2.
as knowing that whilst we walk honestly therein, we do service to the
Lord Jesus. It is noted of the virtuous, wise, faithful and godly woman, that
she seeks wool, Pro. 31.13.15.
and flax, and works willingly with her hands: She rises also while it is
yet night, and gives meat to her household. Faith awakeneth the sluggard,
rowseth the laisie, makes the idle lay his bones to work, and him that was a
purloyner to deal truly, justly and honestly. It is the best cock to call up
the drowsy: for it ringeth in his ear; when will thou arise? lo the Lord
calls thee to thy task; why tariest thou so long, stirrest so slowly? The
Sun rejoices as a Giant to run his race: why sharpenest not thou thy self
to the work which God has laid upon thee? It it the willingest messenger to
be sent upon any business; the trustiest ouerseer of any labor, the most
free vndergoer of any toil or pains, ^ Chron. 34.12.
you need not call him to reckoning who accounts with faith: nor have him
forward who moves by faith: nor chain him to his work, who by faith
undertakes it. Ephesians. 6.8.
For he is assured he does it unto God, who calls upon him, and from whom he
must expect recompense, if he walk chearefully, and in singleness of heart.
When a man is persuaded that his calling is approved of God, and profitable to
men, by helping to maintain the state of the Church or commonwealth, and that
it is that, in which God will be served of him; then he takes it in hand, not
like a drudge or droile who does his wo^k for fear of the whip, nor like an
hireling, who works only for wages; nor like eye-seruants who leave their
business when the masters eye is turned aside: but with good will, diligence
and singleness of heart, he addresseth himself to his work, being assured of
Gods assistance and furtherance therein, whom he serves in his vocation. This
persuasion that we serve the Lord in our callings, who is a bountiful
play master, and has promised a large blessing unto us, forces to go
willingly about that work, which otherwise would seem toylesome and
unpleasant.

Esaias 7.4. Ios. 7.5. Pro. 31.17.
faith produces hardines, valor, and actiuitie: for it assures of divine
protection and good success: Pride makes men ashamed of many things, which in
the world be matters of disgrace: but faith witnesses, that the truest honor
is to be Gods servant, 2. Tim. 1.7.8.9. Heb. 11.7.
and the greatest glory to do whatsoever the Lord requires at our hands. By
faith Noah prepares the Arc, let the men of the old world mock their fill.
By faith Judah goes up to fight the Lords battles, Judge. 1.4. Heb. 11.9.10.
whatsoever danger appear in the voyage. Faith brings Abraham from his
native country, and his fathers house to soiourne in a strange land, when he
is called of the Lord. Mark. 6.18.
Faith makes John the Baptist bold to tell Herod plainly, that it is not
lawful for him to have his brothers wife, let him take it as he please.
Corruption will suggest, such a thing beseems not a man of my place,
breeding, bringing up; it would be taken ill, might procure displeasure,
trouble, disgrace, and danger: but faith looks to the word of God, and if it
be a duty required encourages to set about it with speed, referring the
issue and event to him that has commanded it, and esteems it the greatest
credit to do the will and pleasure of the Lord.

respects their pains, is well-pleased with their doings; let them do what
they can, they shall not have a good word: But the sound beleiuer is
abundantly satisfied with Gods approbation and reward, and goes on
cheerfully, Heb. 11.35.36.37.
though men show him no countenance, allow noe recompense; yea though he be
molested, persecuted, imprisoned, killed for well-doing. If God be pleased to
vouchsafe other encouragements to take pains, faith makes use of them with
thankfulness: but if they be wanting, it will not give place to negligence or
remissness. 1. Cor 4.3.
With me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's
judgment. Nor of men sought we glory, 1 Thessalonians 2.6.9.
neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome as the
Apostles of Christ. Phil. 3 7.8.
But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea,
doubtless and I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the
knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all
things; and do count them but dung that I may win Christ.

Eccl. 2.26.
in obedience, to right ends, and with an heavenly Mind, exercising the graces
that God has bestowed upon us: whereby it comes to pass that they are
furtherances and not hindrances in the duties of piety. Thus David behaved
himself wisely in all his ways: 1. Sam. 18.14.
and being called of God to the government of the kingdom, he promises to
execute his office in uprightness and innocence to the praise of God: I will
sing of mercy and judgment, Psalm. 101.8.
to thee, O Lord, will I sing.

take upon them a double care; one to do the works of their place, the other
to take thought about the blessing and success of their labors. But faith in
Gods Word, where it reigns, applies the hearts of men to the performance of
their duties, and leaves the blessing of their endeavors to the good will and
pleasure of God. Thus we are exhorted to do. Psalm. 55.22.
Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never
suffer the righteous to be moved. A Christian is to consider the difficulty
of all things pertaining to him, and what danger is in them. He is diligently
to set his hand to the work, and through negligence to omit nothing that is of
moment to effect and bring it to pass. But having taken counsel and labored
painfully, he must lay aside care of the event, and roll his burden upon the
Lord, who has promised that all things shall be well regarded. And this faith
has an infallible ground, namely, that God best knows our wants, and will
give us all things, which in his heavenly wisdom he knows to be necessary.
Math. 6.32. 1. Pet. 5.7.
Your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of these things, that is, food
and raiment. Cast your care on God, for he cares for you. Nothing shall be
wanting unto them that fear God. And thus faith building upon these promises,
obtains a greater blessing of God with less care, toil and vexation, Psalm.
127.2. Prou. 16.3.
then worldlings can by all their cunning shifts, sleights and devices. Commit
thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established. Faith also
restrains the desires of transitory things, Math. 6.33.
as it lifts up the heart to better and more durable riches, seeks the
Kingdom of Heaven, hungers and thirsts after righteousness, Psalm. 42.1.
Psalm. 16.5.
feeds upon the mercy of God in Christ, and rests satisfied in the Lord as
its on^y portion.

Adam, labor and affliction attend every state and condition of life, both
which are easily digested by faith. If we be crossed in the good things we go
about, faith considers, that this comes to pass by the good providence of
God, who sometimes crosses our good and lawful attempts, least we should
trust in our selu^s, despise the poor and afflicted, and be glued fast to
these earthly things. Also it remembers us of Gods dear and tender love, who
of mere favor does chastise, and will so order, that all miseries shall in
the end turn to our good. And by such like meditations it works the soul to
contentation in every estate. Phil. 4.11, 12.
I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. I know both
how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where, in all things I am
instructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and to suffer
need. Moreover, faith turns crosses into advantage: as it calls the
afflicted unto the examination of his ways, and reformation of what is amiss,
works self-denial, emptieth the heart of the love of base and transitory
things, quickens unto prayer, causes to relish mercy with more sweetness,
and covet spiritual things more earnestly, reuiueth hope, and gains
experience of Gods favor and tender compassion.

Phil. 4.6.
Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with
thankesgigiuing, let your request be made known unto God. In the midst of
sorrows faith is silent from murmuring and impatience: Psalm. 62.1.
but it is never silent in prayer: it does continually cry unto the Lord for
succor.

according to Gods will and appointment, to the glory of his Name, and comfort
of his people: 1. Cor. 7.31.
and teaches so to use the world, as willingly to renounce all interest in the
world, for the fashion thereof passes away. And with what conscience toward
God we are inclined to labor, with the same we are stirred up to give to
others as need requires. The desire of the slothful kills him; Prou. 21 25,
26. Psalm. 112.9.
for his hands refuse to labor. He coueteth greedily all the day long: bu^ the
righteous giu^th and spares not.



But how should a Christian live by faith touching the good success and
direction of that work or business whereunto he is called, How we may live
by faith touching the success of our labors.
which he finds to be much above his strength or means?

Prou. 3.5. Ier. 10.23. Prou. 16.2. and 21.2.
what is right in our eyes is abominable before God. Nor is our wisdom to
dispose and manage matte^s resolved on, of greater ripeness and perfection.
Our own counsel often leads us awry in things corporal, either we miss of the
right manner, or use right means amiss, either we lean upon deceitful
props, or take a good staff by the wrong end. And if we be brought into
distress, then how are we plunged in our consultations, not knowing which way
to turn our selves. As for power to accomplish any work, Lam. 3.37.
though never so well conceived, though means never so potent, so ready at
hand, so well ordered: though the business be in never so good forwardness,
we have it not. Alas, poor impotent creatures, what can we do of our selves,
who cannot keep our breath for one moment? In God we live, and move, and have
our being: and he that maintains life must perfect all our works for us. In
matter of profit no man can say, Deuteronomy. 8.17, 18.
my power, my labor, the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth. Nor in
point of honor, By my policy I have builded my nest on high, by the strength
of my arm I have gotten me the victory. Psalm 44.3.
This weakness is discovered by faith, which in every business works
self-denial, knowing the beginning, direction and success of all honest
labors to be of grace.

Judges 1.1. and 20.18.23.28. Esaias 8.20.
It asks counsel at the word, and follows the determination of it. It
chooses what God approves, though to humane wisdom it seem bootlesse and
improbable: it rejects what God condemns, though to corrupt reason it
promise profit and contentment. For true confidence is obedientiall, subiecting
it self to the will of God as the rule of holiness, acknowledging his
souereigntie, subscribing to his wisdom as most absolute, and to his ways as
most true, just and merciful. And as it consulteth with God, so it puts
over all business into his hands, and in a manner out of our own. For it
trusts to him for ability to the work, provision of the means, the
disposition of them, Math. 6.25. and 10.19.
and good success to come by them. Yea, though all means fail, and all
things seem to make against the proceedings, faith relieth upon God, who is
everlasting, unchangeable, the same for ever. The eye of faith is ever toward
the Lord, that he may instruct and guide in the way; that he would be with us
to enable in the work we take in hand. And for the means, it looks to have
such ministered which may advance our just designs, and esteems them most
precious, Psalm. 32.8. Ezr. 5.5. Judges 6.16. Exodus 4.11.
which he shall put into our hands. To provide means is the work of God: it
only belongs to us to use them which he shall grant in mercy. And seeing we
have not this wisdom and ability of our selves, faith expects both from
the hand of God, scil. to prepare means and make us wise to take the
opportunity. The props of this faith are these two. The props of this faith.




Math. 10.29. Prou. 20.24. Psalm. 37.23.
Not a Sparrow falls to the ground but by his will. Man's goings are of the
Lord. He disposes of every thing that concerns us and our affairs. The work
that we take in hand is not our own, but the Lords: Prou. 16.3. Psalm. 37.5.
Acts 14.23. 2. Sam. 10.12.
and the success of the business does depend upon his pleasure, to whom it
must be committed. Let the Lord do what seems him good. And he gives issue,
not according to the seeming abilities of the persons, or likelihood of the
means used, but according to the good pleasure of his own will.

of all lawful means. For God, who works for us, will have us work with
him. Faith l^yeth hold upon the promises of aid and provision with one hand,
works with the other. Nothing can so much encourage, quicken, confirm in
pains taking, as faith. The persuasions of faith are most powerful, the
motives strong, the encouragements effectual to put life and vigor into the
dull and sluggish. He that belieueth will labor, and not make haste. He that
distrusteth not his play master is not hasty to get the pay into his own hand:
because he knows whom he has trusted.

2. Chron 20.12.
O Lord, there is no strength in us to stand against this great people that
comes against us, neither do we know what to do: but our eyes are toward
thee. And if the work stick fast, and stir not at the first, it pulls the
harder: difficulties incite to earnest pr^yer. Psalm. 5.2, 3.
In the morning will I direct me unto thee, and will look out.

Judges 5.18.
Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that ieoparded their lives unto the death,
in the high places of the field. In the most easy work faith will not suffer
to lean upon our own strength: in greatest difficulties it will not despair
of the Lords aid. ^shua 1.5, 9.
This is the stay of faith He will not leave thee, nor forsake thee. Every thing
is too hand for us, if we rely upon our selves: nothing too hard if we trust
in the Lord, and go forth in the power of his might.

P^ou. 16.3.
Commit thy ways vnt^ the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be direct^d. Faith
looks to the promise, and concludes assuredly, The word of the Lord shall
never fail: The zeal of the Lord of hosts will bring it to pass.

David promises to praise God three times, nay, seven times a day: that he
would do it openly in the Congregation, and privately by himself: and yet, as
though he had forgot himself, and been much behind others in this duty, he
quickens up himself unto it: Bl^sse the Lord, Psalm. 103.1, 2.
O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy Name. The meditation
of Gods Name is sweet, the remembrance of his kindness is pleasant: the
faithful cannot satisfy themselves in singing his praises. Hence it is that
they stir up themselves and provoke others to magnify the Lord. Judge. 5.9,
10, 11
My heart is toward the Governors of Israel, that offered themselves
willingly among the people, Bless ye the Lord. Speak ye that ride on white
Asses, ye that sit in Judgment, and walk by the way. They that are
delivered, from the noise of the Archers in the places of drawing water; there
shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the Lord, even the righteous acts,
toward the inhabitants, of his villages in Israel.

CHAP. XI.
How to live by Faith in the use of Gods Ordinances, the Word and Saments.

There be many promises of Gods blessing his ordinances to his peoples good.
Esaias 55.1, 2, 3.
IN Scripture we read many promises made to such as shall conscionably hearken
unto the Word, and receive the holy Sacraments, the seals of the covenant of
grace; that God will bless his own Ordinances to their edification, comfort,
strengthening in grace and everlasting salvation. Ho, every one that thirsts,
come ye to the waters, and he that has no money: Come ye, buy and eat, yea
come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price: Wherefore do ye
spend money for that which is not bread? His Word.
and your labor for that which satisfies not? Hearken diligently unto me, and
eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight it self in fatness.
Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live. The law
of the Lord is perfect converting the soul; Psalm. 19.7, 8.
the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of
the Lord are right rejoicing the heart: the Commandment of the Lord is pure,
inlightning the eyes. A wise man will hear and will increase learning: Prou.
1.5.
and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. Take fast hold of
instruction, Prou. 4.13.
let her not go; keep her for she is thy life. My son, hear thy fathers
commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother; Bind them continually
upon thy heart, and tie them about thy neck. Prou. 6.20, 21, 22, 23.
When thou go, it shall lead thee; when thou sleep, it shall keep thee,
and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee. For the Commandment is a
lamp, and the Law is light: and reproves of instruction are the way of life.
John 17.17.
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. Mich. 2.7. 1. Pet. 2.2.
Esaias 9.2. Math. 4.15. Deuteronomy. 32.2. Zech. 14.8. Ezekiel. 47.9. Cant. 2.5. Esaias 55.1,
2. Acts 5.20. Acts 13.26. Acts 20.32.
Do not my words do good to him that walks uprightly? As newborn babes
desire the sincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby. This is
confirmed by the comparisons, which are used to set forth the use and profit of
the word; as it is resembled to the light, rain, deaw, living water, wine and
milk: By the titles which are given unto it; as it is called the word of this
life, the word of this salvation: and by the passages of Scripture, which
testify, that the word is able to save our souls. And now Brethren, I commend
you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to
give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. For after that in
the wisdom of God, 1. Cor. 1.21. 1. Tim. 4.16.
the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of
preaching to save them that believe. Take heed unto thy self; and unto the
doctrine: continue in them: for in doing this thou shall both save thy self,
and them that hear thee. James 1.21.
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness, and superfluity of naughtiness, and
receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
This also is manifest of the Sacraments, And Sacraments.
which be truly called a visible word, because that which is spoken in the word
to the ear, is in visible signs represented to our eyes, and sealed to our
hearts, that we may be the more assured of them to be ours: And were
purposely ordained of God to help our weak faith, that having his word and
seal, we might be put out of doubt, that we shall as certainly be made
partakers of Christ himself, and all his benefits, as we are of the outward
signs of his covenant. What the Apostle says of Circumcision, that is true of
Sacraments in general, Romans 4.11.
They are seals of the righteousness of faith, or of the covenant of grace.
And for the better assurance of the belieuer, that receiving the outward sign
as he ought, he shall be partaker of the thing signified, very often that which
properly belongs to the thing sealed, is given to the outward sign; as that
Baptism saves, 1 Pet. 3.21. Acts 22.16. Col. 2.12. Romans 6.3.
that our sins are washed away in Baptism; and that we are buried with
Christ by Baptism: And the like of the Lords Supper, when our Lord Jesus did
ordain it, he speaking of the Bread said, This is my Body, Math. 26.26, 28
and of the Wine, This is my Blood of the New Testament. These promises are
firm grounds, whereupon the faithful soul may build this affiance, that by
the sincere and conscionable use of Gods holy Ordinances, the Word and
Sacraments, he shall be made wise unto salvation, confirmed in faith,
strengthened in grace, refreshed with joy and comfort, and perfected unto
everlasting happiness. And the serious meditation and remembrance of these
things, is exceeding profitable to quicken and encourage unto cheerful and
constant attendance upon God in his ordinances, that so we may in due season
reap the sweet fruit thereof. Prou. 8.34.35.
Blessed is the man that hears me: watching daily at my gates, waiting daily
at the posts of my doors. For who so finds me, finds life; and shall
obtain favor of the Lord. Did Christians often and earnestly breathe themselves
in meditation on those great things, that God offers in the Gospel; and his
truth and faithfulness to make good whatsoever he has spoken: Did they set
before them, both the mercy of God in ordaining the Sacraments for the
strengthening of their faith, and his grace and faithfulness in bestowing upon
them freely, that which he offers and seals unto them in these outward
seals: Did they consider what he graciously promises in both, and expect to
be made partakers of them in the use of those ordinances; it would maruellously
comfort, and quicken to the diligent use of all holy means ordained of God for
our present comfort, quickening, and strengthening, and for our everlasting
salvation. Its necessary to live by faith in the use of Gods Ordinances.


This faith is necessary; for it avails not to live under the Gospel, and to
be present at the administration of the Sacraments, if they be not used in
faith. The word profits not, Heb. 4.2.
unless it be mingled with faith in them that hear it: And the same may be
said of receiving the Sacraments. Faith is the eye, the hand, the mouth, the
stomach of the soul: by it we see, receive, feed upon Christ. Look as at a
feast, though the Table be never so richly furnished, yet if a man have neither
hand, mouth, nor stomach, he is not fed thereby: so is it here. Nor is it
sufficient to have faith, but it must be exercised to receive that grace which
the word of God does reach us with the seal. It is not the having but the new
exercise of faith, which makes us profitable hearers of the word, worthy
receivers of the Sacrament. Look as a man may have a hand, and yet, if when a
thing is reached forth to him, he do not put it out, nothing is received: so
we may have the grace of faith, and yet, if when God reaches us the body and
blood of his Christ, we do not then awaken it, to lay hold on the grace God
offers, we shall go away without receiving it. Or look as at a feast,
though we have a mouth, and there be plentiful provision, if we will not open
it, and take down the sustenance before us, we shall rise empty; so though
we have the mouth of faith, yet if we do not open it to God now offering to
feed us, we shall not get a crume of grace.

The Acts of faith be these or the like. The Acts of faith in the use of Gods
Ordinances.

and looks unto God to receive what he is pleased, and has promised to give.
But God will not accept that worship, Deuteronomy. 12.32. Esaias 29.13. Math. 15.9. Ier.
7.31.
which he has not appointed, nor work effectually by the diuices of men. No
piety, comfort, or true devotion is, or can be stirred up by hum^ne
traditions: for as they are destitute of commandment for their rule, so are
they of promise, that God will kindle or quicken by them any sparkle of
knowledge, faith, invocation, thankfulness, or other saving motions of heart.

Psalm. 102.4. 1. Chron. 16.11. Psalm. 27.8. Psalm. 42.2. Psalm. 63.1.2.
When thou saidest, Seek ye my face, my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord
will I seek. When shall I come and appear before God. O God, thou art my God,
early will I seek thee: my soul thirsts for thee, my flesh longs for
thee, in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is: To see thy power and
glory, so as I have seen thee in the Sanctuary. How amiable are thy
tabernacles, Psalm. 84.1.2. Verse 3.
O Lord of hosts? My soul longs, yea even faints for the courts of the
Lord: my heart, and my flesh cries out for the living God. Blessed are they
that dwell in thy house. The Leuiticall worship was as a glass more dim, in
which they beheld the face of the Lord obscurely: the word and Sacraments are
to Christians as a clear glass, in which as with open face we behold the
glory of God in Christ. Reu. 4.6. 2. Cor. 3.18.
Christ is present with us, as long as we hold his public worship: he is
found, when we recover it having been lost. Then does the face of the Lord
shine upon us, when he offers himself unto his people to be seen in his
public worship, the pure and undefiled exercises of piety. And from hence
springs the willingness of the Saints, Pro. 8.34.
to wait continually at the posts of wisdoms gates, to hear her words,
their earnest contention and study to preserve, maintain, uphold and set
forward the pure worship of God, and to save, or free it from the dross of
superstitious vanities, which obscure the clear light of the Lords
countenance, and to restore it according to the pattern, if once it fall: and
their diligent inquiry after Christ, if his face be hidden from them, or his
worship be polluted with Idolatry. Cant. 1.7.
Tell me (O thou whom my soul loves) where thou feedest, where thou make
thy flock to rest at noone: for why should I be as one that is veiled, amongst
the flocks of thy companions? Why should I be as a wom^n wasting her self
with sorrow and grief, while I s^eke thy presence in thine ordinances.

Romans 10.19.
Without some knowledge of God in Christ, and of his word going before, there
can be no faith: but faith endeavors the increase of knowledge: It cries
after knowledge, and lifts up the voice for understanding: It seeks her as
silver, and searches for her as for hid treasures. Psalm. 119.20.
My soul breaks for the longing that it has unto thy judgments, at all
times. Verse 27. Psalm. 9 10. and 40.16. Psalm. 105.4. Esaias 58.2.
Make me to understand the way of thy precepts, so shall I meditate or talk of
thy wondrous works This is implied in the phrase of seeking God, which
signifies to bend all their stength and power to know, ^^^nowledge and worship
God aright. Knowledge is pleasant to the belieiung soul, and wisdom
delights the heart. Children covet sweet meats, because they please the
taste; and the belieuer desires the knowledge of God and his word, because it
is sweet and dear unto him. God in Christ is the object of faith; the matter,
whatsoeue i^ revealed of God to be received or beli^ued; and faith it self is
more strong, and the operations of f^^th more lively and comfortable, as these
are bet^e^ known. And from this desire it comes, Act. 16.14. Luke 2.51. Heb.
2.1.2.
that the belieuer does ^pply himself to attend unto the word of truth, ponder
it seriously, and treasure it up safe, that it might not ou^rslip him.

Psalm. 63.8. Deuteronomy. 10.20. and 13.4. Psalm. 63.5. Ioh. 6.51.53. Psalm. 119.31.

Faith follows hard after the word till it be made our own, and its lively
Character stamped upon the soul: It feeds upon every part of the word,
gets interest in every promise, and sucketh vigor and juice out of it. By
faith we st^^k^ close unto the word, and the word does stick, or is ingra^^ed
into us. And to the end we might possess the pearl of the Gospel, and be
seasoned with the doctrine of grace thoroughly, faith renounceth all interest in
the lusts of the flesh, and things of this life. It earnestly pondereth and
meditateth upon the great things of the law, to work the heart to an holy
esteem of the excellent and heavenly things contained in it, and to a gracious
affectation to every duty therein required. And it importuneth the Lord by true
prayer, without hypocritical halting or starting aside, that he would be
pleased to write his law in our hearts, and keep us steadfast unto him, that
we may never depart from his fear. For by faith we cleave fast unto God; but
it is God that knitteth us unto himself: Ier. 1.3.11.
As the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man, so have I tied unto me the
whole house of Israel, that they might be my people.

Genesis 4.4. Heb. 11.4. Psalm. 4^.4.
By faith Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof
an offering to the Lord. By faith David went with the multitude unto the house
of God with the voice of joy and praise: faith can neither be cloyed with Gods
presence, nor account any service too good for him. The voice of faith is, I
will sing and give praise with the best member that I have. How should he be
negligent in the use of any ordinance, who sees God in his whole worship, and
finds comfort, tastes sweetness in every part. We see by experience, the
desire of gain draws men to rise early, rest late, toil hard in any
business that may bring in commodity: But faith begets an vns^tiable,
operative, constant thi^st and desire of spiritual things, which makes the
belieuer industrious in the use of all means, whereby his tre^sure may be
increased. Look as the Mearchant takes pains to enrich himself, ^say 64.4.
Com^^ with ^. Cor. 1.9.
and increase his substance; so does the faithful soul to get possession of
the true treasure. Lively faith and bu^ning love toward the Lord, lodge both
together, which bring forth pa^nes and forwardnes n the works of holiness,
willingness and delight to please him in all things.

More particularly it may be inquired how parents in faith should present their
children unto baptism. Parents should in faith present their Child to God in
Baptism.
What ^se Christians should m^ke of their baptism, when they come to age and
discretion; and how we are to receive the Lords Supper in faith. The dedication
of a child to God, is a work of singular and great importance, one of the
weightiest services we can take in hand, though (we may fear) it is considered
of few. For to say nothing of the ignorant and profane sort, who savor not the
things of God, and therefore can have no reverent regard to the seals of the
covenant; how many be there of better hopes, well instructed in the principles
of religion, diligent frequenters of Gods Ordinances, and careful to beautify
their profession with an holy conversation, who did never distinctly, and in
good earnest consider of this matter? when yet they must needs acknowledge,
that it cannot be well done as it ought, if it be not done in faith.

The acts of faith in this particular be these, The acts of faith in this
particular.
and such like.

I am thy God, Genesis 17.7.9. Act. 2.39.
and the God of thy seed. For the promise is made unto you, and to your
children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall
call: which covenant, as it is made with the parents and their seed, so does
the faith of the parent apprehend the promise of the couen^nt for himself and
for his seed. And this is the ground of that tender, which a Christian m^kes of
his Child unto holy Baptism. For by natural generation the Children of
believing parents are defiled with sin, and so under wrath: but the are holy
by covenant and free acceptance, the believing parent embracing the merciful
promise of God for himsel^e, and for his posterity. Infants are not borne
Christians by natural birth, but made Christians by virtue of the covenant,
God promising to accept them, upon offer made unto him by the parents.



David reasons, Thou, O Lord, 2. Sam. 7.27.
of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build
thee an house: therefore has thy servant found in his heart to pray this
prayer unto thee. And so should every Father, O Lord, thou have couenanted to
be my God, and the God of my posterity, therefore am I bold to entreat thy
fatherly acceptance of my poor Infant.

sins, adoption, and everlasting inheritance: solemnly to be made free of
the society of Saints, and wear the Lords badge and liuerie. And what an high
and incomprehensible mercy it is, that God has promised, and does vouchsafe
these great and inestimable blessings, not only to himself a miserable and
wretched sinner, but also to his posterity, who by natural generation are
enemies to his Highness, dead in trespasses, and in bondage unto the curse of
the law. With these or the like meditations of faith, believing parents must
present their children unto Baptism, that they might receive the seal of
regeration, remission of sins, and spiritual liberty; that the Name of God
might be set upon them, and their names registered amongst the free Denisons of
the heavenly Jerusalem. And fervent effectual prayer does accompany this
admission, that God would be pleased to accept the party baptized for his
child by grace and adoption, release him of his sins, and make him partaker of
his everlasting kingdom. Faith belieueth what God promises, as he promises
it: and beggeth fervently, what he gives freely.



to bring up their children in information and fear of the Lord, being instant
with God to bless their endeauours for the good of their children, and the
glory of his name. For thus faith persuades: Thy child is not thine, but the
Lords: thou have dedicated him unto the service of his Maiest^e, and he from
whom thou receiuedst him at first, has committed him to thy charge, to be
trained up in his fear. It is a great honor to be trusted with such a
ch^rge, and it is a fearful sin to neglect so great a trust. Will thou
consecrate thy child to God this day, and leave him to the Devil for ever
after? Will thou teach him a trade, that he might live as a Man, and not teach
him the way of godliness, that he might live as a Christian? Did thou not
undertake for his education in the true Religion, and will thou neglect the
pe^formance of that solemn oath? Mar. 10.25, 16.
Christ commanded the children of Christian parents to be brought unto him: and
will thou present them untaught, and ignorant of the Christian faith? The same
conscience which moved parents to offer their children to Baptism, will
quicken them to endeavor their education in the true faith, and service of God.

By faith we should make right use of our Baptism.
Baptism is a seal of the covenant betwixt God and us, of Gods promise to us
that he will be our God: and of our promise to him, that we will be his people,
repent of our sins, believe in Christ, and walk before him in sincere
obedience. For signification, force, use and fruit it continues, not for a
moment of time, but for the whole course of a man's life. It does respect not
only the time past and present, but that which is to come; yea, that whole time
a man has to spend, from the very act of his Baptism, to his death. For as it
is the seal of a free, everlasting, unchangeable covenant, so is the force and
use of it perpetual. Baptism is the true Sacrament of repentance, for
remission of sins, and spiritual renouation, which being once received,
remains a perpetual testimony and pledge of the everlasting Covenant of
God, and continual washing away of sin by the blood of Christ, and the
Spirit of sanctification. By singular appropriation it represents and
confirms ou^ eng^affing into Christ, The use to be made of our Baptism is
twofold.
but withal it seals the whole Covenant of grace.

The use of Baptism is twofold.

the labor of regeneration; Titus 3.5.
it being an usual thing to call the principal cause, and the instrument by
the same name.

Acts 2.38.
Repent and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ, Acts
22.16.
for the remission of sins. Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins,
calling on the Name of the Lord.

Romans 6.3.
Do ye not know that all we, who have been baptized into Jesus Christ, have
been baptized into his death?

Romans 6.5.
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death: we shall
be also in the likeness of his resurrection. Buried with him in Baptism, Col.
2.12.
wherein also you are risen with him, through the faith of the operation of
God, who has raised him from the dead.

Christ. By nature we are the children of wrath: but by grace and adoption the
sons of God, through faith in Christ, which is sealed in Baptism, wherein
the name of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit is put upon us. When Jacob
blessed the sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasses, Genesis 48.16.
saying, Let my name be named on them; he adopted them for his sons, to have
inheritance with them in the land of Canaan: and when God puts his name upon
us, he signifies and assures that we are his sons. Ye are all the
children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. Gal. 3.26, 27.
For as many of you, as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.

1. Cor. 12.13.
For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or
Gentiles, whether we be bond or free: Ephesians. 4.5.
And Baptism is one of those things whereby the unity of the Spirit is
preserved in the bond of peace.

Mark 16.16. Titus 3.5, 6, 7. 1. Pet. 3.21.
For in Baptism the Lord does promise to be our God, that he will provide us
of all things necessary for soul and body, turn all evils which do befall
in this miserable life, to the furtherance of our salvation, raise up our
bodies at the last day, and receive us unto himself to dwell with him for
evermore. In all which respects Baptism is of great force to strengthen faith,
and ease the heart in distress. For when the repentant sinner feels himself
heavy laden with the burden of his sins, when Satan tempts him to doubt or
despair in regard of his corruptions: when his own corruption moves him to
sin, and he is even now in the combat, the Spirit lusting against the flesh,
and the flesh lusting against the Spirit, and when he is deeply perplexed with
fear of falling away: then the consideration and remembrance of what was
promised, and sealed in Baptism, will serve to stay, support and comfort the
soul. For there he shall find that his name is written in the covenant of
God, that God has promised to give Christ to be his Redeemer, to accept of
Christ's satisfaction for him, to wash away all his sins, as certainly as the
water washes away the filth of the body: and having such a faithful promise
confirmed by seal, wherefore should he be dismayed? In Baptism also God has
sealed unto him the mortification of his sin, by the power of Christ's death;
which is the ground of confidence, that God will enable him to overcome the
rebellious lusts of his heart, and crucify the old man more and more, until
the body of sin be utterly destroyed. True it is, that man by nature is dead
in sin: but in Baptism, God of his mercy has sealed unto the belieuer, his
rising from the death of sin to newness of life. True it is, that of our
selves we are prone to fall away from grace received: But God of his rich
grace seals unto the faithful in Baptism a Resurrection unto immortal
life, which shall grow daily, but never decay. Romans 6.9, 10.
If the faithful be afflicted, and despised of men, persecuted and forsaken,
cast out the visible Congregation, and banished from the horse of God: yea,
even in the agonies of death; the remembrance of the promises sealed in
Baptism, will afford comfort. For if men have forsaken, God has receiu^d
them; If men scorn and contemn, the Lord will acknowledge them. He has long
ago sealed them for his own, received them into his family, undertaken to
provide for them, and adopted them as heirs apparent to the Kingdom of
Heaven. If God had given them his word alone for security, it had been
sufficient; But having confirmed it by seal in Baptism, they have great cause
to rest assured. True it is they may be cast out of the visible assembles, but
they can never be cut off from the invisible Communion of Saints: they must
die, but God has sealed unto them their rising from the grave to everlasting
life, by the power and virtue of Christ's Resurrection: which is a comfort of
all comforts, able to uphold the soul of man in the hour of death.

II. Use.
The second use of Baptism, it is a seal of our duty promised, and so a
spur and provocation to repentance, faith, new-obedience, brotherly love, and
unity.

Mark 1.4.
and by Godly sorrow come home unto God. And as we expect the blessing, we must
look that we fail not in the condition. If we be buried with Christ in
Baptism, it is our duty to mortify the flesh with the affections and lusts,
that it may live no longer, to bring forth fruits unto death. For a dead man
cannot live. By solemn oath we are bound to crucify unruly lusts, which
fight against the soul: and shall we falsify so great a promise? Against whom
should we fight, if not against Satan? or what will he be willing to spare
for the Lords sake, who will not part with his sins? Why should we fear the
strength of Satan, the power of sin, the rage of persecutors, the loss of
earthly things? or despair because of the wrath of God justly kindled against
sin. If we turn unto God by unfeigned repentance, we have his faithful
promise confirmed by seal, that he will be merciful unto our sins, enable
us to overcome our corruptions, fortify us against the powers of Hell, support
us under, or deliver us out of all trials, and graciously provide whatsoever
shall be needful for us.

for his children, remember our necessities, bestow upon us the Kingdom of
Heaven: we shall do great wrong and dishonor to God, if we doubt or make
question, whether he will perform promise freely made, and confirmed by
covenant and seal. We are bound by commandment to believe in Jesus Christ,
and to commit our selves wholly unto him, as unto a faithful Savior: And we
have bound our selves by promise, covenant and seal, that we will believe and
cleave unto him, as our only Savior: shall we then go back, grow remiss,
or give way to doubting? If doubtings arise, through the sight of sin, or
want of sense and feeling comfort, or the world begin to creep into the heart,
and divide it from Christ, let us then remember, we have troth-plighted our
selves to Jesus Christ, and by faithful promise, never ^o be called back,
given our selves wholly to rest, and stick close unto him: and therefore must
admit no thought, whereby we should be drawn aside, or divided, from him.

Romans 6.4.
We are buried with him by Baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised
up from the dead, by the glory of the Father: Even so we also should walk in
newness of life: in which Chapter the Apostle disputes of our actions, that
we should abstain from evil and follow those that are good. We have
solemnly sworn to fight against the Devil, the World, and the Flesh; and
having taken the presse-money of Jesus Christ, it were an immortal disgrace to
accept of truce with Satan. We carry the badge and liuerie of Jesus Christ,
and shall we forsake our colors, and fight for the Devil? It is strange, that
children should leave their parents and take part with their enemies: We have
given our selves unto God, and were once dedicated unto his service; shall we
now turn back, and offer our selves unto Satan? Honor is due unto parents:
If God be our Father, we must freely submit our selves to his will and
pleasure. God will strengthen us to obey, and accept of weak, if sincere
obedience: and that shuts forth all place of excuse. If we be engrafted into
the similitude of Christ's resurrection, we must express by our actions the
power and likeness of Christ's resurrection; which is done, when we walk in
all-pleasing before God, and set our affections upon things above. And this, as
it is commanded on Gods part, so it is sealed on our part in Baptism.

The new exercise of faith required in the worthy receiving the Lords Supper.
It goes ill with the natural body, when the joints are dissolved: it is
unnatural that the members of the body mystical should be divided.

It is not the having faith, but the new exercise of faith, which makes us
worthy receivers of the Lords Supper. The Corinthians had faith, yet received
not the grace of the Sacrament, because they received not in faith.

The acts of faith in this ordinance.
The acts of faith in receiving the Lords Supper are many.

in what esteem will a Christian have this pledge of Gods favor, when he
certainly understands what it does signify and assure?



O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee: Psalm. 63.1.
my soul thirsts for thee, my flesh longs for thee. The Sacrament of the
Lords Supper is a great and spiritual feast, whereunto the faithful are
invited: and faith whetteth the spiritual appetite to long after, and relish
the fatness and marrow, which is there provided.



and beauty of Christ, and the happiness of the soul which is united unto
him; and thereupon humbly embraces his offer o^ love.

Wherefore my brethren, Romans 7.4.
ye are also become dead to the Law by the body of Christ, that ye should be
married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should
bring forth fruit unto God.

John 6.55.
His flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed. Meat to be eaten,
not with the teeth, but by faith. Meat indeed, not in nature, but in effect,
because it nourishes the soul, and gives eternal life to them that eat
thereof. And by faith we spiritually eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and
drink his blood. And as he that eats wholesome food, is strengthened thereby,
and made fit and able for the actions of this life; so he that feeds upon
Christ spiritually and by faith, is strengthened to the actions of spiritual
life, and made able for the exercises of piety and holiness.

Cant. 2.16.
so that he may truly say, My beloved is mine, and I am his. As a couple, who
have lawfully given faith to each other, and confirmed the same by pledge or
token in the Congregation, are assured of each other: so when we have
contracted our selves unto Christ, and received the pledge thereof, we come to
be assured by faith, that Christ is ours, and that we have commun^on in all
the benefits of his death and passion. Th^s faith reasons, God the Father
has freely promised the pardon of all sins in and through Jesus Christ:
Christ does offer himself as a Redeemer to deliver them from the power of
darkness, and to bring them into perpetual grace with his Father, to wash
them from their sins by his blood and spirit, and to preserve and nourish
them unto life eternal, who will receive and believe in him. And being so
lovingly called and invited, I have received the merciful promise, and
^esigned my self unto Jesus Christ; why then should I stand in doubt? I hear
the word of promise, I see and have received the seals annexed to the Word of
grace, the true and faithful testimony of God confirmed by oath, and I may
not question his truth, nor draw back from mine own promise, to rest upon and
cleave unto him for evermore.

Arise, O my soul, and sing for joy, for thy light is come, and the glory of
the Lord is risen upon thee. Thou did sit in darkness, forlorn and
miserable, guilty of sin, in bondage to the curse, in fear of eternal
condemnation: but now God is appeased, Christ has satisfied justice, pardon is
proclaimed, thou have received the free gracious promise, and eternal blessed
peace is concluded. And for thy greater assurance, God has added his seal to
his free grant of pardon: holy bread is added, and given to thee for a
Sacrament and divine testimony, that the body of Christ was crucified for
thee: blessed wine is added, and given to thee, for a certain pledge and
token, that the blood of Christ was shed for thee, that righteousness
purchased by that sacrifice is thine, that eternal salvation procured by that
price is thine by an irreuocable title. Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget
not the great ^oue of God in giving his Son to die, that thou might be
deliu^re^ from the fear of hell and death, forget not the Love o^ Christ in
s^ffering death, that thou might b^ se^ f^ee from the curse of the law, and
burning wrath of God deserved by sin; forget not the grace and favor of God
in calling thee to feast with him, and giving this pledge and earnest of his
perpetual love. Thou can not forget ^hese, but thou forgett^st thy self:
thou can not neglect these, but thou hate thy self. What can thou desire
more, then to have God to be thy God, Christ to thy Savior? What would thou
remember if thou forget the love of Christ in suffering death for thy
redemption, and the earnest of his love, whereby he does assure, that his body
was crucified, and his blood shed for thee?

Means to stir up our selves to receive the Lords Supper in faith.
Now the better to stir up our selves to receive this Sacrament in faith.



to every poor, despised, thirsty, afflicted soul, who does desire and will
receive him.



John 6.65.
and eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, he dwells in me, and I in him.
Thus we must quicken our hearts to rejoice in belief of the promises made and
sealed, waiting upon God, till he be pleased to give the sense and comfort of
it.

CHAP. XII.
The faithful are bound, and it is behouefull for them, to believe the
threatenings.

GOd is as well just as merciful, faithful and true as well in his threats, as
in his promises: and therefore equally to be believed in both, so far as in
his word he has assured us of both. He who is certain of his salvation,
knows assuredly he should be damned, if he should go on in sin without
repentance, and shall taste of much bitterness, if he grow indulgent to his
corruptions. It is as sure, that God will condemn the wicked and impenitent,
as that he will save the righteous and repentant. 1. Cor. 9.27.
If Paul beat not down his body, and bring it into subjection, he shall be
as dross and refuse. If the righteous forsake his righteousness and commit
wickedness, Ezekiel. 18.24.26.
or be a worker of iniquity, all his former righteousness shall be forgotten.
The godly man is not slauishly to fear falling away, or running into
destruction, but wisely to believe the threatenings, to prevent falling into
sin, and so into condemnation. The subject, who fears the punishment of the
law, and keeps himself innocent, takes a wise course for his own
security. Every part of Scripture is Gods word, of certain and and undoubted
truth, which cannot be gaine-said, written for the benefit and profit of them,
who shall be heirs of salvation: But the threatenings are part of the word of
God. Romans 15.4.
Whatsoever things were written afore-time (even as well examples of judgment
inflicted upon transgressors, and threatenings denounced against them that
shall offend, as promises of mercy to allure unto obedience) were written for
our learning and instructon. 1. Cor. 10.6.
In the state of innocence there was use of threatenings, so is there in the
state of grace. As a means to keep our first parents from sin, Genesis 2.17.
Job 31.21.23.
the Lord denounced death against them, if they should eat of the forbidden
fruit. Job professes, he durst not lift up his hand against the Fatherless,
for destruction from God was a terror unto him. So David, My flesh trembles
for fear of thee: Psalm. 119.120.
and I am afraid of thy Judgments. The righteous man wisely considers the
house of the wicked: Pro. 21.12.
but God overthrows the wicked for their wickedness. And sure it is
expedient for us, that threatenings should be mingled with the promises of
grace, for (so prone are we to flatter, and favor our selves) milder doctrine
would grow cold, unless these spurrs were added. The tarxtnesse of the
threatening makes us best taste the sweetness of promise: Sour and sweet make
the best sauce; promises and threatenings mingled, fit our state, and serve to
keep the heart in the best temper. We grow ouerbold with God if the
threatening do not awe; are soon dejected, if the promise do not support. The
Lord knows both necessary to keep us in awe; and therefore begins with
promises, to the intent we might follow him the more willingly; but to drive
forward when we stop, or grow remiss, he adds threatenings. Heb. 12.28.29.
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom, which cannot be moved, let us have grace,
whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear. For our
God is a consuming fire.

The acts of faith in respect of the threatenings be these. The acts of faith
in respect of the Threatenings.




Psalm. 52.6. Act. 5.5. Psalm 119.120. Ion. 1.16. 1. Chron. 13.12. Hab. 3.16.
The righteous also shall see and fear. As the Child quaketh, when he hears
that his Father is angry with, or does correct a servant: so the he^rt and body
of the faithful tremble, as often as they consider the severity of Gods wrath
against the wicked and vng^dly. When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips
quiu^red at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my
self, that I might rest in the day of trouble: That is, when the fame of thy
divine punishment and judgment came to mine ea^es, which thou have decreed to
inflict upon thy people; Pro. 29 27.30 Psalm 40.8.
my belly, that is, my heart and bowels moue^ for grief and fear, Thus Noah
hearing of Gods just wrath against the sinful world, and of his purpose to
overthrow all living flesh by water, Heb. 11.7.
was moved with great fear and reverence at this strange, dreadful, and
mighty work of God and from the view of this his great and just judgment, his
faith made him arise to a more earnest consideration of the glorious Majesty of
the Alm^ghty. And this is the effect of judgment executed by men according to
the direction of Gods word. And all Israel shall hear and fear, Deuteronomy. 13.11.
and 17.13. and 19 26. Ier. 10.7.
and shall do no more any such wickedness. True faith then works an holy
fear and reverent awe of God in respect of his judgments. Who would not fear
thee, O King of nations? for to thee does it appertain. Psalm. 76.7.
Thou even thou art to be feared, and who may stand in thy sight when once
thou art angry? The godly man's assurance of Gods favor will stand well with
reverence of his Majesty, and fear of temporal afflictions, spiritual
desertions, and the torments of hell, not as an evil he shall fall into, but
which he shall escape by the constant study and practice of holiness. For our
assurance to escape damnation through the death of Christ, Phil. 2.12. Math.
10.28. Luke 12.4.5.
is no greater then our care to avoid sin, which leads thereunto. Work out
your salvation with fear and trembling. Fear not them which kill the body,
but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to
destroy both soul and body in hell.

Who knows the power of thy anger? 2. Cor. 5.10, 11. Psalm. 90.11.
Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.

Nineueh believed the preaching of Jonah, Jonas 3.6, 7, 8.
that within forty days that great City should be destroyed, he rose from
his throne, put on sackcloth, and proclaimed a Fast unto the Lord. And when the
Lord testified his displeasure against the Israelites by sending thunder and
lightning in Wheat Harvest, all the people feared greatly, and said unto
Samuel, 1. Sa. 12.18, 19.
Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not; for we have
added unto all our sins, this evil, to ask us a King. Now the threatenings
believed work the same effect, Judges 2.3, 4.
that the judgments seen. When Josiah heard what the Lord spoke against
Jerusalem, and against the inhabitants of that place, his heart was tender, 2.
Kin. 22.18, 19
and he humbled himself before the Lord.

Israelites were in safety on the shore, looking back upon the danger
escaped, when they passed through the red Sea, Exodus 15.1, 2.
they make a joyful noise to the God of their salvation: their songs are
answerable to their fore-conceiued fear. And so when the Lord brought back
the captivity of Babylon, Psalm. 126.2.
their mouths were filled with laughter, and their tongues with joy. The due
consideration of our deserts, manifest by the threatenings contained in the Word
of God, does maruellously affect the heart with desire to publish and spread
abroad the loving kindness of the Lord, when by faith in Christ we see our
selves to be set free from the dreadful curses of the Law, and mercifully
saved from the righteous judgment of our sins. By this which has been
said, it is manifest, that this life of faith is most excellent and
comfortable, and by good proof and experience we should be able to say so, if
we would be persuaded, but to take a taste of the benefit and sweetness that
it brings. For by this faith we are directed to seek and follow after
Christ, Ephesians. 3.17.
till we come to be assured, that he dwells in us as the fountain of life,
and that in him we are delivered from the gilt and punishment of all our
sins: 2. Cor. 5.19.
whereas others, who live not by it, waver, are often distracted, and know not
where to begin the foundation of that great work, nor how to build thereon. By
this faith we may come to sound rest and holy security about our salvation
from time to time, enjoying the comfort of it still more and more with
incredible joy: whereas others, even the best, are often unsettled and much
disquieted. If the Lord lead us into the dark, and exercise us with manifold
afflictions and temptations, by this faith we are enabled to hold him by the
hand, to cast our selves upon the promises of grace, and so relying upon his
power, faithfulness and mercy, to promise safety unto our selves above
likelihood and appearance; yea, when we feel the contrary. The rage of sin
is weakened, and we have strength against it, though not always to prevail
(which were not expedient) yet at least to be in combat with it, which is ever
a good testimony of our safety: for hereby we prove our selves to be lively
members of the Church Militant. Also by this we are preserved against fearful
sins, and have grace to walk in newness of life, and all parts of it with
joy and cheerfulness. If we live by faith we have deliverance from many sharp
and bitter afflictions; and bear those, which we must go under, more meekly
and patiently: because it makes us depend upon Gods promises, not stinting him
to any set time, manner of deliverance, or measure of affliction. By it we walk
in our callings more cheerfully, honestly, painfully; and with less
distractio^, toil and vexatio^, but with more profit, then they that flow in
with wealth, and have all shifts and cunning slights to gain by. Psalm. 127.1,
2.
For whiles we see God ever going before us in all our earthly dealings and
actions (as we should more look to it, that we find it so, then to our
greatest profits and weightiest dealings) this faith shall uphold us in the
quietest estate and most sweet peace, such as all the carnal wisdom of man
shall never find nor enjoy. This faith teaches us to pray at all times as our
necessities require, with feruency and confidence, even in the depth of
afflictions, when the grave is ready to swallow us up, and shut her mouth upon
us, Psalm. 69.13, 14, 15, 16.
it enableth to look unto the Lord, and with strong arguments to implore his
aid. O Lord God of my salvation, Psalm. 88.1, 2, 3.
I have cried day and night before thee for my soul is full of troubles, and
my life draws nigh unto the grave. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee,
O Lord: Lord hear my voice. Psalm. 130.1, 2.
My spirit within me is ouer-whelmed, my heart within me is desolate. I stretch
forth my hands unto thee, Psalm. 143.3, 6.
my soul thirsts for thee in a thirsty land. O remember not against us
former iniquities, let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: Psalm. 79.8.
for we are brought very low. If the affliction be very grievous and of long
continuance, faith does neither quail, nor cease to seek help; but looks up
to the Lord, expecting salvation in due time to be revealed. O God, Psalm. 74.1,
2.
why have thou cast us off for ever? Why does thine anger smoke against the
sheep of thy pasture? Rem^mber thy Congregation, which thou have purchased of
old, the rod of thine inheritance, Psalm. 69.29. Psalm. 68.35. Verse 22.
which thou have redeemed. I am poor and sorrowful, let thy salvation, O God,
set me up on high; for God is the strength of his people, who will br^ng them
again from the depths of the Sea. The life of faith shall (...) in joy and
comfort. He that trusts in the Lord shall r^ (...) in his holy Name. I am a
wonder unto many, but the (...) my strong refuge. Psalm. 71.7, 8.
Let my mouth be filled with thy praise, and with thy honor all the day. Our
heart shall rejoice in him, Psalm. 33.21.
because we have trusted in his holy Name. Lo, this is our God, we have waited
for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord, Esaias 25.9.
we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoice in his salvation. The
expectation of them that hope in the Lord, Psalm. 68.19, and 69.30.
shall not be frustrated, therefore they shall rejoice in him, and sound forth
his praises. He that has learned to live by faith, Heb. 11.13.
shall also die in faith. All these died in or according to the faith. If we
know how to walk with God by faith, as Henoch did, all the days of our life,
amidst the manifold temptations and changes that we meet withal in this world;
we shall the better encounter with death, when the agonies thereof be upon us.
Death is many ways terrible, and the assaults of Satan at that time are
usually most strong, as being his last: but he that has taken out this
lesson, To live by faith, shall easily quench the fiery darts of the Devil,
manfully conquer this strong enemy, renew his repentance, and confidence in
Gods mercy upon the sight of sin, and willingly resign himself into the hands
o^ God. This is the ordinary course, Live in faith, and die in faith, Live
holily, and die blessedly. Therefore let us leave late repentance to them that
think it but a sport to venture a soul, and take that course that is sure to
speed. To say no more, it is exceeding dangerous to put off repentance from day
to day, though some few have obtained mercy at their latter end: But this is
sure, he that lives in faith, shall die in faith, and live in glory for
evermore. Amen.
