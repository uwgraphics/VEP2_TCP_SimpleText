blood of Christ being sprinkled upon my soul by the Heb. 10.22 Acts 15.9.
hand of faith, does wash me from all my sins.

Q. What profit have thou by the use of the Lords supper?

A. As I receive the Mat. 26.29.27. 1 Cor. 11.23.24 25.

receives with all Christ Jesus with 1. Cor. 1.30 2. cor. 5.21
his death and righteousness to the Romans 4.1. ephe. 1.13.
sealing up of my everlasting salvation.

Q. Seeing that they which receive these mysteries unworthily, eat and drink
their own condemnation: how ought thou to prepare thy self to the right

2. Cor 9.70
examine my self whether I k stand strongly in the true faith of Jesus Christ
or no.

Psa. 511, Romans 7.2.4.
hatred and lothing of the same.

Thirdly, if any offense be betwixt others and me, that I Mat. 5.2. Heb.
12.14.
reconcile my self unto them, and Mat. 18.22 colos. 3.12.13.
forgive them even as Christ has forgiven me.

Finis.
OPen our eyes (O Lord) that we may see the wo^derous things of thy law: that
by them as by a glass we may see our own weakness, and by our weakness our
wickedness, and by them both our accursednesse: then cause thy sweet comforts
and consolations contained in thy Gospel, to shine into our souls, by a true
and a lively faith in Christ Jesus: beseeching thee that our dry and stony
hearts, may by the sweet dewes and showers of thy heavenly spirit, be so
moistened and softened, that as good ground they may ever be yielding forth
good fruit to the glorifying of thy name, to the suppressing of sin, and
increasing of virtue, through Christ our Savior. Amen.
