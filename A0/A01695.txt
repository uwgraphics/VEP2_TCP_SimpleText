To the Reader.
I HAVE endeavored (gentle Reader) to set down the principal points of
Christian Religion, in as plain sort as I could possible: for their sakes
especially, whose capacities are small, and memories unable to co^taine much.
If I have attained that which I attempted (that is to say, their profit) I
have my desire: If otherwise* then although my work deserve no^ praise (which
if it did, were due only to God) yet my will desires pardon, which I do not
doubt to obtain at thy hands, seeing I seek nothing but thy advantage. The
excuses that are daily made for ignorance, while one lays the fault in his
want of time, an other in his simplicity, and want of capacity, and others in
want of memory, etc. did much move me to try what I could do, to do them
good: although I am not ignorant, that others also have gone about the same.
But such is the dullness of our days, and so hard is it to be both short and
yet plain, in so great matters, that it is well, if either their or my labor,
or all that we all can do, may bring men forward in the faith. If we miss
this, yet because we mean it, he that is not uncharitably suspicious, will
not think the labor superfluous. If this come to the hands of such, as are
already past such A. B. Cees* let it not offend them, that children are led,
though they being men can go alone. And let them leave this, either to
children in years or in knowledge: which must of necessity be trained up in
this, or such short and plain sort, if they will profit, as I pray God they
may, and we all every day increase in knowledge, and grow in the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who ever preserve you, and to whom be praise in the
Church through all generations for ever.

my self, and makes it effectual to salvation to my self only.

Romans 8. 32.
his Son, whom he has given to me, and with him will give me all things

22. 23. Heb. 10. 14. Heb. 1. 1. Mat. 21. 5. Luke. 1. 32. 33 Ihon. 18. 36.

mean^ of my salvation: my only Priest, to reconcile me to his father: my
only spiritual King, to govern and rule me by his word and holy Spirit.


M. What manner of person is Jesus Christ, which does all this for you?


P. Both God and man. Romans 1. 3. 4. Phil. 2. 6. 7.



M. Which words teach you that he is God?


P. These, His only son our Lord. Romans 8. 3. John. 10. 36.



M. Whose Son do you mean he is?


P. The son of God the Father. Mat. 17. 5. Heb. 1. 5.



M. Why call ye him his only son, seeing men and Angels are called his
sons also?


P. Because he is begotten of his very Psalm. 82 6. Romans 8. 14. Job. 1. 6. John
1 14. Heb. 1. 3.
substance, and is true and very God with his Father.


M. When was he begotten of his Father?


P. He has been begotten ever, even Pro. 8. 22. John. 1. 1. 2
as the Father has been ever, without beginning, or else he were not God.


M. And which words teach that Gal. 4. 4.
was made man?

(...)lie Ghost, borne of the vingin Marie.

without all sin.


M. Why was he borne of the Virgin ^arie?


P. That he might be a true man like Heb. 2. 11. 16
unto us in all things, sin excepted.


M. Wherefore was he man?


P. To stand in our room, and to suffer Heb. 2. 14. 15 Gal. 4. 4. 5. 1. Tim.
2. 6.
in body and soul, that curse which (...) due to our sins.


M. Which words teach this?


P. Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Luke. 23. 1. John. 19. 33 Mark 15. 40.
was crucified, dead, and buried, he descended into hell.


M. What do these former words signify?


P. That he was condemned of Pontius Mat. 27. 24. and 25 26. Luke. 23. 33. Phi.
2. 8.
Pilat, to the accursed death of the cross, which he suffered in body.


M. And what signifies, Descended into hell?


P. It is added, to show that he humbled Phil. 2. 8.
him self, and went under the wrath of God even in the same curs^ Gal. 3. 13
Es. 53. 10. Mat. 26. 39. Lu. 22. 44. Mat. 27. 46.
death which he suffered in body: A^ that he felt the anguishe and horror ^ ye
same wrath of God in his soul which caused him to sweat drops of blood and
to cry, my God, my God, why ha^ thou forsaken me?


M. This curse and wrath of God the^ you mean is the hell that he was in
before he died: and that he was in it bot^ in body and soul.


P Yea verily: for the scripture teachet^ Io. 19. 30.
no other suffering in any other place for our deliverance from the same.


M. And how does this profit you?


P. Because I believe that this which 1. Pet. 2. 24. Gal. 3. 13.
he thus suffered in his body and soul, was for my sins, so that he has
redeemed me from the same for ever.


M. You said before that he is God also, did this his Godhead suffer any thing?


P. No: For God cannot suffer.


M. Wherefore then was he God?


P. That he might overcome death, and 2. Cor. 13. 4.
get the victory, which being man only, 1. Pet. 3. 18.
he could not have done.


M. Which words contein this victory?


P. These following, The third day he Luc. 24 40.
rose again, etc. Act. 2 32.



M. Did the same body rise again?


P. Yea, and is ascended into heaven, Ioh. 20. 27 Luk 24. 51. Mar. 16. ^9.
and is there God and man in the glory ^f his father.


M. Did he ascend by and by after he ^ose again?


P. No: but walked forty days on the Act. 1. 3.
^arth, and showed him self to his disciples, to confirm them in the truth of
his resurrection.


M. What does this profit you?


P. I believe that he now has given to Romans 4. 25. Ephe. 4. 7. 8 1. Cor. 1. 30
^ne his holiness of nature, and the righteousness of his whole life, to
sanctify, and ^ustifie me always before God.

28. 18. Ephe. 1. 22. 1. Cor. 15. 25.
r^ight hand of God the father almighty?


P. That his father has given him all power in heaven and earth, to govern
and defend his Church, and to confound all the enemies of the same.


M. What else does he now in heaven for us?


P. He makes continual intercession to Romans 8. ^4. Heb. 7. 25. Io. 14. 13. 14
his father, so that I believe whatsoever I ask in his name, I shall surely
receive.


M. what remains to be done of him?


P. From thence shall he come to iudg^ Acts. 1. 11. 2. Tim. 4. 1.
the quick and the dead.


M. Who are they?


P. All that are departed this life before 1. Cor. 15. 51. 1. These. 4. 15.
his coming, and all which shall be her^ alive at his coming.


M. What is your confidence in that day Act. 3. 19. and 17. 30. 31. 1. Cor. 1.
8. Jude. 24. Mat. 25. 34.
whereof we ought to have chief regard?


P. That by this faith in him, I shall stand blameless, and that he wll give
me the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, which he has purchased for me.


M. Why believe you in ye holy Ghost?


P. Because he does work this faith and Ephe 1. 13. 14 2. Cor. 1. 22. Romans 8.
16.
assurance of this my salvation by Christ in my heart.


M. How shall it be known that he has wrought this faith in your heart?


P. By his inseparable work of regeneration, Tit. 3. 5. Io. 3. 5. 6.
or new birth in my nature.


M. What is that?


P. To sanctify me daily, by killing sin 2. These. 2. 13. 1. These. 4. 3. 1.
Pet. 1, 2.
in me, and by quickening me to newnes of life.


M. What is the Catholic Church?


P. All, of all nations which have, do, and 1. Cor. 1 2. Act. 2. 47. and 13.
48. and. 15. 8 9.
shall thus believe in Jesus Christ for salvation.


M. What is the communion of Saints?


P. That all these in what part of the Ephe 4. 12. 13. 1. Cor. 1. 9. 1. Ihon.
1. 3. Ioh. 17. 17. 19
^arth so ever they live, are gathered in^o the fellowship of Christ, and are
par^akers in commune of all his benefits where by they are made Saints.


M. What is the remission of sins?


P. That all their sins are so fully Ephe. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. 1. Io. 2. 12.
^unished in Christ, that they are free^y forgiven and remitted to them for
ever.


M. And what is the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?


P. That all their bodies shall be raised Io. 6. 54. Romans 8. 11. 1. Cor. 15.
41. 43. 44. Phil. 3. 22.
up again at the last day, and be joined to their souls, to live with Jesus
Christ for ever in true glory.


M. What does the belief of all these things profit you?


P. I believe that now being called 2. Cor. 15. 5. Act. 26. 18. Romans 8. 30.
from ignorance to this faith and assurance in Jesus Christ with them, I do,
and shall enjoy all these benefits also with them for ever.


M. Thus you have gone briefly thorough the Law, and the doctrine of Faith,
what is next, the true understanding whereof belongs to a true Christian?


P. The Sacraments.


M. What is a Sacrament? Romans 4. 11. Gal. 3. 27. 1. Cor. 11. 26.



P. An outward sign and sure seal to strengthen my faith in Christ, and al
his benefits by my outward senses: and a badge of my profession before men.


M. How many are there in Christ his Church to this use? Ephe. 5. 26. Titus.
3. 5. 1. Pet. 3. 21. 1. Cor. 11. 20. and 23. 24. 25.



P. Two.


M. Which are they?


P Baptism, and the Lords supper.


M. What is the outward sign and sure seal of Baptism?


P. Water. John. 3. 23. Acts. 8. 36. 38



M. How does it strengthen your faith in Christ, and all his benefits by your
senses?


P. That* as I see and know water wherewith I have been baptized, does wash
and make clean things that are foul: so as certainly Christ does give
himself to me, that his blood may alwais Acts. 2. 38. and 22. 16.
wash and cleanse me from al my sins.


M. And what is the outward sign and sure seal of the Lords supper?


P. Bread and wine. 1. Cor. 11, 13 24. 25.



M. And how do they strengthen your faith in Christ by your senses?


P. That as I know bread and wine to be a full and perfect nourishment of my
1. Cor. 10. 16
^^die: and as I see the same given unto ^e in the communion by the Minister:
Mat. 26. 26. 27. Ioh. 36. 54. 35
and I take, and eat, and drink ye same: ^o as certainly Christ gives to me
his ^ody and blood to be the full and perfect ^oode of my soul to eternal
life.


M. From whence have they this force, ^o seal and confirm the truth of these
^hinges in your heart?


P. From the institution of Christ, who Luke 22. 19. 20 Matthew. 28. 19.
^s truth it self, and can not deceive.


M. By what means is this brought ^o pass, seeing Christ's body is now in
^eauen, and there must continue till his Act. 3. 21.
^omming again?


P. By the secret power of the holy Io. 6. 63. 56.
Ghost, which by faith makes me one with Christ: and Christ with me.


M. Seeing Christ (which you have Romans 3. 4. 2. Tim. 2. 13.
^aide before) cannot deceive, offers himself, and al his benefits thus
certain^y, by them, Are all that come unto them, partakers of the same?


P. No: for the unfaithful, ignorante, 1. Cor. 10. 4. Heb. 11. 6.
and unrepentant, by their unworthiness, deprive themselves of them, and
receive only the outward signs, to their 1. Cor. 11. 28 and. 29.
own condemnation.


M. What else remains to be understood and used of a true Christian?


P. Prayer. Romans 12. 12. Col. 4. 2. 1. Peter. 4. 7. 1. Tim. 2. 8. Luke. 11. 9.
and 13. Iac. 1. 5.



M. What is ye use of prayer unto you?


P. Seeing God is now become my father, through Christ his son, I ^^e and
have recourse to him by the same, for all things needful, both for my body
and soul.


M. How ought we to pray?


P. Even as our Lord Jesus Christ Luke. 11. 1. 2.
himself has taught us.


M. Rehearse the same as you have learned it.


P. Our father which art in heaven, etc. Luke. 11. 7. Matthew. 6. 9.



M. May we pray with no other words then these?


P. Yes: but this is the rule whereby al our prayers must be squared, if we
shall Iac. 4. 3. 1. Io. 5. 14.
pray aright, and obtein any thing by them.


M. And do you pray so often as you use these words?


P. No: for if I do not understand what Math. 15. 7. 8.
things I pray for, and desire earnestly 1. Cor. 14. 15
in my heart, whatsoever I ask with my tongue, I babble rather then pray. Matt.
6. 7.



M. What things does this rule of prayer chiefly contain?


P. First I learn by it, how to be prepared to prayer: secondly, what things
to pray for.


M. In which words learn ye how to be prepared to prayer?


P. In these: Our father which art in heaven.


M. What learn you by this word Our?


P. That I ought to be in love, and to pray Iac. 5. 16.
for others as well as for my self.


M. What in this word Father?


P. That I must pray with this faith Iac. 1. 6. Romans ^. 15. Gal. 4. 6. Ephe. 3.
11.
and sure trust in his son Jesus Christ, wrought in my heart by the holy
Ghost, whereby only I, and all the faithful, have this ^ol^nesse to call him
father.


M. What in these: Which art in heaven?


P. That he is ready and able to perform, Psalm. 145. 18. Phil. 4. 5. 6. 1
Peter. 5. 7. John. 17. 1. Psalm. 25. 1.
whatsoever I ask: And that my mind must be removed from all earthly and
wandering thoughts, and present it self before him in heaven.


M. What follows next?


P. The petitions for the things contained 1. Iho^. 5. 15.
in the same.


M. How many are they?


P. Six.


M. What things are they for?


P. Three for those things which chiefly Io. 7. 18. 17. 1 1. Cor. 10. 31.
concern Gods glory: And three for all things needful for our selves.


M. Show them breefly, which concern Gods glory.


P. The first, that his name may be reverenced, Psalm. 72. 19. 1. King. 8. 43.
Act. 4. 29. 30 John 16. 8. Luke. 18. 7. 8, Reave. 6. 10 and 22. 20.
feared, and by all means glorified amongst us. The second, that he may
reign daily more and more in our hearts, by his word and spirit: and in his
