THE FIRST BOOK of FRANCIS BACON; of the proficience and advancement of
Learning divine, and humane. To the King.
THere were under the Law (excellent King) both daily Sacrifices, and free
will Offerings; The one proceeding upon ordinary observance; The other upon a
devout cheerfulness: In like manner there belongs to Kings from their
Servants, both Tribute of duty, and presents of affection: In the former of
these, I hope I shall not live to be wanting, according to my most humble duty,
and the good pleasure of your Majesty's employments: for the later, I thought
it more respective to make choice of some oblation, which might rather refer
to the propriety and excellency of your individual person, than to the
business of your Crown and State.

Wherefore representing your Majesty many times unto my mind, and beholding
you not with the inquisitiue eye of presumption, to discover that which the
Scripture tells me is inscrutable; but with the obseruant eye of duty and
admiration: leaving aside the other parts of your virtue and fortune, I have
been touched, yea and possessed with an extreme wonder at those your virtues
and faculties, which the Philosophers call intellectual: The largeness of
your capacity, the faithfulness of your memory, the swiftness of your
apprehension, the penetration of your Judgment, and the facility and order of
your elocution; and I have often thought, that of all the persons living, that
I have known, your Majesty were the best instance to make a man of Platoes
opinion, that all knowledge is but remembrance, and that the mind of man by
nature knows all things, and has but her own native and original motions
(which by the strangeness and darkness of this Tabernacle of the body are
sequestered) again revived and restored such a light of Nature I have observed
in your Majesty, and such a readiness to take flame, and blaze from the least
occasion presented, or the least spark of another knowledge delivered. And as
the Scripture says of the wisest King: That his heart was as the sands of the
Sea, which though it be one of the largest bodies, yet it consists of the
smallest and finest portions; So has God given your Majesty a composition of
understanding admirable, being able to compass and comprehend the greatest
matters, and nevertheless to touch and apprehend the least: whereas it should
seem an impossibility in Nature, for the same Instrument to make it self fit
for great and small works. And for your gift of speech, I call to mind what
Cornelius Tacitus says of Augustus Caesar: Augusto profluens and quae
principem deceret, eloquentia fuit: For if we note it well, speech that is
uttered with labor and difficulty, or speech that sauoreth of the affectation
of art and precepts, or speech that is framed after the imitation of some
pattern of eloquence, though never so excellent: All this has somewhat
servile, and holding of the subject. But your Majesty's manner of speech is
indeed Prince-like, flowing as from a fountain, and yet streaming and
branching it self into Natures order, full of facility, and felicity,
imitating none and ininimitable by any. And as in your civil Estate there
appears to be an emulation and contention of your Majesty's virtue with your
fortune, a virtuous disposition with a fortunate regiment, a virtuous
expectation (when time was) of your greater fortune, with a prosperous
possession thereof in the due time; a virtuous observation of the laws of
marriage, with most blessed and happy fruit of marriage; a virtuous and most
christian desire of peace, with a fortunate inclination in your neighbor
Princes thereunto, So likewise in these intellectual matters, there seems to
be no less contention between the excellency of your Majesty's gifts of
Nature, and the universality and profection of your learning. For I am well
assured, that this which I shall say is no amplification at all, but a positive
and measured truth: which is, that there has not been since Christ's time any
King or temporal Monarch which has been so learned in all literature and
erudition, divine and humane. For let a man seriously and diligently reuolue
and peruse the succession of the Emperors of Rome, of which Caesar the
Dictator, who lived some years before Christ, and Marcus Antoninus were the
best learned: and so descend to the Emperors of Grecia, or of the West, and
then to the lines of France, Spain, England, Scotland and the rest, and he
shall find this judgment is truly made. For it seems much in a King, if by
the compendious extractions of other men's wits and labors, he can take hold of
any superficial Ornaments and shows of learning, or if he countenance and
prefer learning and learned men: But to drink indeed of the true Fountains
of learning, nay, to have such a fountain of learning in himself, in a King,
and in a King borne, is almost a Miracle. And the more, because there is met in
your Majesty a rare Conjunction, as well of divine and sacred literature, as of
profane and humane; So as your Majesty stands invested of that triplicitie,
which in great veneration, was ascribed to the ancient Hermes; the power and
fortune of a King; the knowledge and illumination of a Priest; and the learning
and universality of a Philosopher. This propriety inherent and individual
attribute in your Majesty deserves to be expressed, not only in the same and
admiration of the present time, nor in the History or tradition of the ages
succeeding; but also in some solid work, fixed memorial, and immortal
monument, bearing a Character or signature, both of the power of a king, and
the difference and perfection of such a king.

Therefore I did conclude with my self, that I could not make unto your
Majesty a better oblation, then of some treatise tending to that end, whereof
the sum will consist of these two parts: The former concerning the
excellency of learning and knowledge, and the excellency of the merit and
true glory, in the Augmentation and Propagation thereof: The latter, what the
particular acts and works are, which have been embraced and undertaken for
the advancement of learning: And again what defects and vndervalewes I find
in such particular acts: to the end, that though I cannot positiuely or
affirmatiuelie advise your Majesty, or propound unto you framed particulers;
yet I may excite your princely Cogitations to visit the excellent treasure of
your own mind, and thence to extract particulers for this purpose, agreeable
to your magnanimity and wisdom.

IN the entrance to the former of these; to clear the way, and as it were to
make silence, to have the true testimonies concerning the dignity of Learning
to be better heard, without the interruption of tacit objections; I think
good to deliver it from the discredites and disgraces which it has received;
all from ignorance; but ignorance severally disguised, appearing sometimes in
the zeal and jealousy of Divines; sometimes in the severity and arrogancy
of Politiques, and sometimes in the errors and imperfections of learned men
themselves.

I hear the former sort say, that knowledge is of those things which are to be
accepted of with great limitation and caution, that the aspiring to overmuch
knowledge, was the original temptation and sin, whereupon ensued the fall of
Man; that knowledge has in it somewhat of the Serpent, and therefore where it
enters into a man, it makes him swel. Scientia inflat. That Solomon gives a
Censure, That there is no end of making Books, and that much reading is
weariness of the flesh. And again in another place, That in spacious
knowledge, there is much contristation, and that he that increases knowledge,
increases anxietie: that Saint Paul gives a Caveat, that we be not spoiled
through vain Philosophy: that experience demonstrates, how learned men, have
been Arch-heretiques, how learned times have been inclined to Atheism, and
how the contemplation of second Causes does derogate from our dependence upon
God, who is the first cause.

To discover then the ignorance and error of this opinion, and the
misunderstanding in the grounds thereof, it may well appear these men do not
observe or consider, that it was not the pure knowledge of nature and
universality, a knowledge by the light whereof man did give names unto other
creatures in Paradise, as they were brought before him, according unto their
proprieties, which gave the occasion to the fall; but it was the proud
knowledge of good and evil, with an intent in man to give law unto himself,
and to depend no more upon Gods commandments, which was the form of the
temptation; neither is it any quantity of knowledge how great soever that can
make the mind of man to swell; for nothing can fill, much less extend the
soul of man, but God, and the contemplation of God; and therefore Solomon
speaking of the two principal senses of Inquisition, the Eye, and the Ear,
affirms that the Eye is never satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear with
hearing; and if there be no fullness, then is the Continent greater, than the
Content; so of knowledge it self, and the mind of man, whereto the senses are
but Reporters, he defines likewise in these words, placed after that Calendar
or Ephemerides, which he makes of the diversities of times and seasons for all
actions and purposes; and concludes thus: God has made all things beautiful
or decent in the true return of their seasons. Also he has placed the world
in Man's heart, yet cannot Man find out the work which God works from the
beginning to the end: Declaring not obscurely, that God has framed the mind
of man as a mirror, or glass, capable of the Image of the universal world,
and joyful to receive the impression thereof, as the Eye ioyeth to receive
light, and not only delighted in beholding the variety of things and
vicissitude of times, but raised also to find out and discern the ordinances
and decrees which throughout all those Changes are infallibly observed. And
although he does insinuate that the supreme or summarie law of Nature, which
he calls, The work which God works from the beginning to the end, is not
possible to be found out by Man; yet that does not derogate from the capacity
of the mind; but may be referred to the impediments as of shortness of life,
ill conjunction of labors, ill tradition of knowledge over from hand to hand,
and many other Inconveniences, whereunto the condition of Man is subject. For
that nothing parcel of the world, is denied to Man's inquiry and invention:
he does in another place rule over; when he says, The Spirit of Man is as
the Lamp of God, wherewith he searches the inwardnesse of all secrets. If
then such be the capacity and receipt of the mind of Man, it is manifest, that
there is no danger at all in the proportion or quantity of knowledge how
large soever; least it should make it swell or outcompasse it self; no, but it
is merely the quality of knowledge, which be it in quantity more or less,
if it be taken without the true correctiue thereof, has in it some Nature of
venom or malignitie, and some effects of that venom which is ventositie or
swelling. This correctiue spice, the mixture whereof makes knowledge so
sovereign, is Charity, which the Apostle imediately adds to the former
clause, for so he says, Knowledge blows up, but Charity builds up; not
unlike unto that which he delivers in another place: If I spoke (says he)
with the tongues of men and Angels, and had not Charity, it were but as a
tinckling Cymball; not but that it is an excellent thing to speak with the
tongues of Men and Angels, but because if it be severed from Charity, and not
referred to the good of Men and Mankind, it has rather a sounding and
unworthy glory, than a meriting and substantial virtue. And as for that
Censure of Solomon concerning the excess of writing and reading Books, and
the anxietie of spirit which redoundeth from knowlegde, and that admonition of
Saint Paul, That we be not seduced by vain Philosophy; let those places
be rightly understood, and they do indeed excellently set forth the true
bounds and limitations, whereby humane knowledge is confined and circumscribed:
and yet without any such contracting or coarctation, but that it may comprehend
all the universal nature of things: for these limitations are three: The
first, That we do not so place our felicitic in knowledge, as we forget our
mortality. The second, that we make application of our knowledge to give our
selves repose and contentment, and not distaste or repining. The third: that we
do not presume by the contemplation of Nature, to attain to the mysteries of
God; for as touching the first of these, Solomon does excellently expound
himself in another place of the same Book, where he says; I saw well that
knowledge recedeth as far from ignorance, as light does from darkness, and
that the wise man's eyes keep watch in his head whereas the fool roundeth
about in darkness: But withal I learned that the same mortality inuolueth
them both. And for the second, certain it is, there is no vexation or anxietie
of mind, which resulteth from knowledge otherwise than merely by accident;
for all knowledge and wonder (which is the seed of knowledge) is an impression
of pleasure in it self; but when men fall to framing conclusions out of their
knowledge, applying it to their particular, and ministering to themselves
thereby weak fears, or vast desires, there grows that carfulness and
trouble of mind, which is spoken of: for then knowledge is no more Lumen
sic^um, whereof Heraclitus the profound said, Lumen siccum optima anima, but it
becomes Lumen madidum, or maceratum, being steeped and infused in the humors
of the affections. And as for the third point, it deserves to be a little
stood upon, and not to be lightly passed over: for if any man shall think by
view and enquiry into these sensible and material things to attain that light,
whereby he may reveal unto himself the nature or will of God: then indeed is
he spoiled by vain Philosophy: for the contemplation of Gods Creatures and
works produces (having regard to the works and creatures themselves)
knowledge, but having regard to God, no perfect knowledge, but wonder, which is
broken knowledge: And therefore it was most aptly said by one of Platoes
School, That the sense of man caryeth a resemblance with the Sun, which (as
we see) opens and reuealeth all the terrestrial Globe; but then again it
obscureth and concealeth the stars and celestial Globe: So does the Sense
discover natural things, but it darkeneth and shuts up Divine. And hence
it is true that it has proceeded that diverse great learned men have been
heretical, whilst they have sought to fly up to the secrets of the Deity by
the waxen wings of the Senses: And as for the conceit that too much knowledge
should incline a man to Atheism, and that the ignorance of second causes
should make a more devout dependence upon God, which is the first cause;
First, it is good to ask the question which Job asked of his friends; Will you
lie for God, as one man will do for another, to gratify him? for certain it
is, that God works nothing in Nature, but by second causes, and if they would
have it otherwise believed, it is mere imposture, as it were in favor
toward God; and nothing else, but to offer to the Author of truth, the
unclean sacrifice of a lie. But further, it is an assured truth, and a
conclusion of experience, that a little or superficial knowledge of
Philosophy may incline the mind of Man to Atheism, but a further proceeding
therein does bring the mind back again to Religion: for in the entrance of
Philosophy, when the second Causes, which are next unto the senses, do offer
themselves to the mind of Man, if it dwell and stay there, it may induce some
oblivion of the highest cause; but when a man passes on further, and sees the
dependence of causes, and the works of providence; then according to the
allegory of the Poets, he will easily believe that the highest Link of
Natures chain must needs be tied to the foot of Jupiters chair. To conclude
therefore, let no man upon a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill applied
moderation think or maintain, that a man can search too far, or be too
well studied in the Book of Gods word, or in the Book of Gods works;
Divinity or Philosophy; but rather let men endeavor an endless progress or
proficience in both: only let men beware that they apply both to Charity, and
not to swelling; to use, and not to ostentation; and again, that they do not
unwisely mingle or confound these learnings together.

And as for the disgraces which learning receives from Politiques, they be of
this nature; that learning does soften men's minds, and makes them more unapt
for the honor and exercise of Arms; that it does mar and pervert men's
dispositions for matter of government and policy; in making them too curious
and irresolute by variety of reading; or too peremptory or positive by
stricktnesse of rules and axioms; or too immoderate and ouerweening by reason
of the greatness of examples; or too incompatible and differing from the
times, by reason of the dissimilitude of examples; or at least, that it does
divert men's travails from action and business, and brings them to a love of
leisure and priuatenesse; and that it does bring into States a relaxation of
discipline, whilst every man is more ready to argue, than to obey and
execute. Out of this conceit, Cato surnamed the Censor, one of the wisest men
indeed that ever lived, when Carneades the Philosopher came in Embassage to
Rome, and that the young men of Rome began to flock about him, being allured
with the sweetness and Majesty of his eloquence and learning, gave counsel
in open Senate, that they should give him his dispatch with all speed, least
he should infect and inchaunt the minds and affections of the youth, and at
unawares bring in an alteration of the manners and Customs of the State. Out
of the same conceit or humor did Virgill, turning his pen to the advantage
of his Country, and the disadvantage of his own profession, make a kind of
separation between policy and government, and between Arts and Sciences, in
the verses so much renowned, attributing and challenging the one to the
Romans, and leaving and yielding the other to the Grecians, Turegere imperio
populos Roman mem^to, Hae tibi eru^t arts, etc. so likewise we see that
Anytus the accuser of Socrates laid it as an Article of charge and accusation
against him, that he did with the variety and power of his discourses and
disputations withdraw young men from due reverence to the Laws and Customs of
their Country: and that he did profess a dangerous and pernicious Science,
which was to make the worse matter seem the better, and to suppress truth by
force of eloquence and speech.

But these and the like imputations have rather a countenance of gravity, than
any ground of Justice: for experience does warrant, that both in persons and in
times, there has been a meeting, and concurrence in learning and Arms,
flourishing and excelling in the same men, and the same ages. For as for men,
there cannot be a better nor the like instance, as of that pair Alexander the
Great, and Julius Caesar the Dictator, whereof the one was Aristotle's Scholar
in Philosophy, and the other was Ciceroes Rival in eloquence; or if any man
had rather call for Scholars, that were great Generals, then Generals that
were great Scholars; let him take Epaminondas the Thebane, or Xenophon the
Athenian, whereof the one was the first that abated the power of Sparta; and
the other was the first that made way to the overthrow of the Monarchy of
Persia: And this concurrence is yet more visible in times than in persons, by
how much an age is greater object than a Man. For both in Egypt, Assyria,
Persia, Grecia, and Rome the same times that are most renowned for Arms, are
likewise most admired for learning; so that the greatest Authors and
Philosophers, and the greatest Captains and Governors have lived in the same
ages: neither can it otherwise be; for as in Man, the ripeness of strength of
the body and mind comes much about an age, save that the strength of the
body comes somewhat the more early; So in States, Arms and Learning,
whereof the one correspondeth to the body, the other to the soul of Man, have
a concurrence or nere sequence in times.

And for matter of policy and government, that Learning should rather hurt,
than enable thereunto, is a thing very improbable: we see it is accounted an
error, to commit a natural body to Emperique Physicians, which commonly have
a few pleasing receipts, whereupon they are confident and aduenturous, but know
neither the causes of diseases, nor the complexions of Patients, nor peril of
accidents, nor the true method of Cures; We see it is a like error to rely
upon Advocates or Lawyers, which are only men of practice, and not grounded in
their Books, who are many times easily surprised, when matter falls out
besides their experience, to the prejudice of the causes they handle: so by
like reason it cannot be but a matter of doubtful consequence, if States be
managed by Emperique Statesmen, not well mingled with men grounded in Learning.
But contrary wise, it is almost without instance contradictorie, that ever any
government was disastrous, that was in the hands of learned Governors. For
howsoever it has been ordinary with politic men to extenuate and disable
learned men by the names of Pedantes: yet in the Records of time it appears
in many particulers, that the Gouernements of Princes in minority
(notwithstanding the infinite disadvantage of that kind of State) have
nevertheless excelled the government of Princes of mature age, even for that
reason, which they seek to traduce, which is, that by that occasion the state
has been in the hands of Pedantes: for so was the State of Rome for the first
five years, which are so much magnified, during the minority of Nero, in the
hands of Seneca a Pedanti: So it was again for ten years space or more during
the minority of Gordianus the younger, with great applause and contentation in
the hands of Misi^heus a Pedanti: so was it before that, in the minority of
Alexander Seuerus in like happiness, in hands not much unlike, by reason of
the rule of the women, who were aided by the Teachers and Preceptors. Nay, let
a man look into the government of the Bishops of Rome, as by name, into the
government of Pius Quintus, and Sex^ Quintus in out times, who were both at
their entrance esteemed, but as Pedanticall Friars, and he shall find that such
Popes do greater things, and proceed upon truer principles of Estate, than
those which have ascended to the Papacy from an education and breeding in
affairs of Estate, and Courts of Princes; for although men bred in Learning,
are perhaps to seek in points of conuenience, and accommodating for the
present which the Italians call Ragioni di (...), whereof the same Pius Quintus
could not hear spoken with patience, tearming them Inventions against Religion
and the moral virtues; yet on the other side to recompense that, they are
perfect in those same plain grounds of Religion, Justice, Honor, and Moral
virtue; which if they be well and watchfully pursued, there will be seldom
use of those other, no more than of Physic in a sound or well dieted body;
neither can the experience of one man's life, furnish examples and presidents
for the events of one man's life. For as it happens sometimes, that the Graund
child, or other descendent, resembles the Ancestor more than the Son: so
many times occurrences of present times may sort better with ancient examples,
than with those of the later or immediate times; and lastly, the wit of one
man, can no more counteruaile learning, than one man's means can hold way with
a common purse.

And as for those particular seducements or indispositions of the mind for
policy and government, which learning is pretended to insinuate; if it be
granted that any such thing be, it must be remembered withal, that learning
ministers in every of them greater strength of medicine or remedy, than it
offers cause of indisposition or infirmity; For if by a secret operation, it
make men perplexed and irresolute, on the other side by plain precept, it
teaches them when, and upon what ground to resolve: yea, and how to carry
things in suspense without prejudice, till they resolve: If it make men
positive and reguler, it teaches them what things are in their nature
demonstratiue, and what are coniecturall; and as well the use of distinctions,
and exceptions, as the latitude of principles and rules. If it mislead by
disproportion, or dissimilitude of Examples, it teaches men the force of
Circumstances, the errors of comparisons, and all the cautions of application:
so that in all these it does rectify more effectually, than it can pervert And
these medicines it conueyeth into men's minds much more forcibly by the
quickness and penetration of Examples: for let a man look into the errors of
Clement the seventh, so lively described by Guicciardine, who served under him,
or into the errors of Cicero painted out by his own pensill in his Epistles
to Atticus, and he will fly apace from being irresolute. Let him look into
the errors of P^ion and he will beware how he be obstinate or inflexible Let
him but read the Fable of Ixion, and it will hold him from being vaporous or
imaginatiue; let him look into the errors of Cato the second, and he will never
be one of the Antipodes, to tread opposite to the present world.

And for the conceit that Learning should dispose men to leisure and
priuatenesse, and make men slothful: it were a strange thing if that which
accustometh the mind to a perpetual motion and agitation, should induce
slothfulness, whereas contrariwise it may be truly affirmed, that no kind
of men love business for it self, but those that are learned; for other
persons love it for profit; as an hireling that loves the work for the wages;
or for honor; as because it bears them up in the eyes of men, and refreshes
their reputation, which otherwise would wear; or because it puts them in
mind of their fortune, and gives them occasion to pleasure and displeasure; or
because it exercises some faculty, wherein they take pride, and so
entertaineth them in good humor, and pleasing conceits toward themselves; or
because it aduanceth any other their ends. So that as it is said of untrue
valors, that some men's valors are in the eyes of them that look on; So such
men's industries are in the eyes of others, or at least in regard of their own
designements; only learned men love business, as an action according to
nature, as agreeable to health of mind, as exercise is to health of body,
taking pleasure in the action it self, and not in the purchase: So that of all
men, they are the most indefatigable, if it be toward any business, which can
hold or detain their mind.

And if any man be laborious in reading and study, and yet idle in business and
action, it grows from some weakness of body, or softnes of spirit; such as
Seneca speaks of: Quidam tam sunt vmbratiles, vt putent in turbido esse,
quicquid in luce est; and not of learning; well may it be that such a point of a
man's nature may make him give himself to learning, but it is not learning that
breeds any such point in his Nature.

And that learning should take up too much time or leisure, I answer, the most
active or busy man that has been or can be, has (no question) many vacant
times of leisure, while he expects the tides and returns of business
(except he be either tedious, and of no dispatch, or lightly and unworthily
ambitious, to meddle in things that may be better done by others) and then the
question is, but how those spaces and times of leisure shall be filled and
spent: whether in pleasures, or in studies; as was well answered by Demosthenes
to his adversary Aeschynes, that was a man given to pleasure, and told him,
That his Orations did smell of the Lamp: Indeed (said Demosthenes) there is a
great difference between the things that you and I do by Lampe-light; so as
no man need doubt, that learning will expulse business, but rather it will
keep and defend the possession of the mind against idleness and pleasure,
which otherwise, at unawares, may enter to the prejudice of both.

Again, for that other conceit, that learning should undermine the reverence
of Laws and government, it is assuredly a mere deprauation and calumny
without all shadow of truth: for to say that a blind custom of obedience
should be a surer obligation, than duty taught and understood; it is to
affirm that a blind man may tread surer by a guide, than a seeing man can by a
light: and it is without all controversy, that learning does make the minds of
men gentle, generous, maniable, and pliant to government whereas Ignorance
makes them churlish, thwart, and mutinous; and the evidence of time does clear
this assertion, considering that the most barbarous, rude, and unlearned times
have been most subject to tumults, seditions, and changes.

And as to the judgment of Cato the Censor, he was well punished for his
blasphemy against learning in the same kind wherein he offended; for when he
was past threescore years old, he was taken with an extreme desire to go to
School again, and to learn the Greek tongue, to the end to peruse the
Greek Authors; which does well demonstrate, that his former censure of the
Grecian Learning, was rather an affected gravity, than according to the inward
sense of his own opinion. And as for Virgils verles, though it pleased him to
brave the world in taking to the Romans, the Art of Empire, and leaving to
others the arts of subjects: yet so much is manifest, that the Romans never
ascended to that height of Empire, till the time they had ascended to the
height of other Arts: For in the time of the two first Caesar's, which had the
art of government in greatest perfection; there li^ed the best Poet Virgilius
Maro, the best Hifforiographer Titus Liuius, the best Antiquarie Marcus Varro,
and the best or second Orator Marcus Cicero, that to the memory of man are
known. As for the accusation of Socrates, the time must be remembered, when it
was prosecuted; which was under the thirty Tyrants, the most base, bloody, and
envious persons that have governed; which revolution of State was no sooner
over, but Socrates, whom they had made a person criminal, was made a person
heroycall, and his memory accumulate with honors divine and humane; and those
discourses of his which were then termed corrupting of manners, were after
acknowledged for sovereign Medicines of the mind and manners, and so have
been received ever since till this day. Let this therefore serve for answer
to Politiques, which in their humorous severity, or in their feigned gravity
have presumed to throw imputations upon learning, which redargution
nevertheless (save that we know not whether our labors may extend to other
ages) were not needful for the present, in regard of the love and reverence
toward Learning, which the example and countenance of two so learned Princes
Queen Elizabeth, and your Majesty; being as Castor and Pollux, Lucida Sydera,
Stars of excellent light, and most benign influence, has wrought in all men
of place and authority in our Nation.

Now therefore, we come to that third sort of discredit, or diminution of
credit, that grows unto learning from learned men themselves, which commonly
cleaves fastest; It is either from their Fortune, or from their Manners, or
from the nature of their Studies: for the first, it is not in their power; and
the second is accidental; the third only is proper to be handled: but because
we are not in hand with true measure, but with popular estimation and conceit,
it is not amiss to speak somewhat of the two former. The derogations therefore,
which grow to learning from the fortune or condition of learned men, are either
in respect of scarsity of means, or in respect of priuatenesse of life, and
meanness of employments.

Concerning want, and that it is the case of learned men, usually to begin
with little, and not to grow rich so fast as other men, by reason they convert
not their labors chiefly to luker, and increase; It were good to leave the
common place in commendation of poverty to some Friar to handle, to whom much
was attributed by Macciauell in this point, when he said, That the Kingdom of
the Clergy had been long before at an end, if the reputation and reverence
toward the poverty of Friars had not borne out the scandal of the
superfluities and excesses of Bishops and Prelates. So a man might say, that
the felicity and delicacie of Princes and great Persons, had long since turned
to Rudenes and Barbarism, if the poverty of Learning had not kept up
Civility and Honor of life; But without any such advantages, it is worthy the
observation, what a reverent and honored thing poverty of fortune was, for
some ages in the Roman State, which nevertheless was a State without
paradoxes. For we see what Titus Liuius says in his introduction. Caeterum aut
me amor neg^ (...), aut (...) vnquam respublica, nec ma^or, nec sanctior, nec
bonis exemplis ditior fuit; nec in quamt^m serae (...) luxuri^que immigra^, nec
vbitantus ac tam diu paupertati ac parsimoniae honos fuerit. We se^ likewise
after that the State of Rome was not it self, but did degenerate; how that
person that took upon him to be Counselor to Julius Caesar, after his
victori^, where to begin his restoration of the State, makes it of all points
the most summarie to take away the estimation of wealth. Verum haec and omnia
mala pariter cum honor (...) desinent; Si neque Magistratus, neque alia v^lgo
^pienda venalia e^unt. To conclude this point, as it was truly said, that
Ru^or est virtutis color, though sometime it come from vice: So it may be ^itly
said, that Poupertas est virtutis fortun^. Though sometimes it may proceed
from misgouernement and accident. Surely Solomon has pronounced it both in
censure, Qui fes^inat ad diu^tias non erit insons; and in precept: Buy the
truth, and sell it not: and so of wisdom and knowledge; judging that means
were to be spent upon learning, and not learning to be applied to means. And
as for the priuatenesse or obscurenesse (as it may be in vulgar estimation
accounted) of life of contemplative men; it is a Theme so common, to extol a
priuatelife, not taxed with sensuality and sloth in comparison, and to the
disadvantage of a civil life, for safety, liberty, pleasure and dignity, or
at least freedom from indignity, as no man handles it, but handles it well:
such a consonancie it has to men's conceits in the expressing, and to men's
consents in the allowing: this only I will add; that learned men forgotten in
States, and not living in the eyes of men, are like the Images of Cassius and
Brutus in the funeral of Iunia; of which not being represented, as many others
were Tacitus says, Eo ipso prefulgebant, quod non visebantur.

And for meanness of employment, that which is most traduced to contempt, is
that the government of youth is commonly allotted to them, which age, because
it is the age of least authority, it is transferred to the disesteeming of
those employments wherein youth is conversant, and which are conversant about
youth. But how unjust this traducement is, (if you will reduce things from
popularitie of opinion to measure of reason) may appear in that we see men are
more curious what they put into a new Vessel, than into a Vessel seasoned;
and what mould they lay about a young plant, than about a Plant corroborate; so
as the weakest Terms and Times of all things use to have the best applications
and helps. And will you hearken to the Hebrew Rabynes? Your young men shall
see Visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, say they youth is the
worthier age, for that Visions are nearer apparitions of God, than dreams? And
let it be noted, that how soever the Conditions of life of Pedantes has been
scorned upon Theaters, as the Ape of Tyranny; and that the modern loosenes or
negligence has taken no due regard to the choice of Schoolemasters, and
Tutors; yet the ancient wisdom of the best times did always make a just
complaint; that States were too busy with their Laws, and too negligent in
point of education: which excellent part of ancient discipline has been in
some sort revived of late times, by the Colleges of the Jesuits: of whom,
although in regard of their superstition I may say, Quo meliores, eo
deteriores, yet in regard of this, and some other points concerning humane
learning, and Moral matters, I may say as Agesilaus said to his enemy
Farnabasus, Talis quum sis, vtinam noster esses. And thus much touching the
discredits drawn from the fortunes of learned men.

As touching the Manners of learned men, it is a thing personal and
individual, and no doubt there be amongst them, as in other professions, of
all temperatures; but yet so as it is not without truth, which is said, that
Abeunt studia in mores, Studies have an influence and operation, upon the
manners of those that are conversant in them.

But upon an attentive, and indifferent reuiew; I for my part, cannot find any
disgrace to learning, can proceed from the manners of learned men; not inherent
to them as they are learned; except it be a fault, (which was the supposed
fault of Demosthenes, Cicero, Cato the second; Seneca, and many more) that
because the times they read of, are commonly better than the times they live
in; and the duties taught, better than the duties practiced: They contend
sometimes too far, to bring things to perfection; and to reduce the
corruption of manners, to honesty of precepts, or examples of too great
height; And yet hereof they have Caueats enough in their own walks: For
Solon, when he was asked whether he had given his Citizens the best laws,
answered wisely, Y ea of such, as they would receive: and Plato finding that
his own heart, could not agree with the corrupt manners of his Country,
refused to bear place or office, saying: That a man's Country was to be used
as his Parents were, that is, with humble per swasions, and not with
contestations. And Caesar's Counselor put in the same Caveat, Non ad vetera
instituta reuocans quae iampridem corruptis moribus ludibrio sunt; and Cicero
notes this error directly in Cato the second, when he writes to his friend
Atticus; Cato optime sentit, sed nocet interdum reipublicae; lo quitur enim
tanquam in repub: Platonis, non tanquam in foece Romuli; and the same Cicero
does excuse and expound the Philosophers for going too far, and being too exact
in their prescripts, when he says; Isti ipsi praeceptores virtutis and
Magistri, videntur fines officiorum paulo longius quam natura vellet
protulisse, vt cu^ ad vltimu^ animo contendissemus, ibi tamen, vbi oportet,
consisteremus: and yet himself might have said: Monitis su^ minor ipse meis,
for it was his own fault, though not in so extreme a degree.

Another fault likewise much of this kind, has been incident to learned men;
which is that they have esteemed the preservation, good, and honor of their
Countries or Masters before their own fortunes or safeties. For so says
Demosthenes unto the Athenians; If it please you to note it, my counsels unto
you, are not such, whereby I should grow great amongst you, and you become
little amongst the Gre^ians: But they be of that nature as they are sometimes
not good for me to give, but are always good for you to follow. And so Seneca
after he had consecrated that Quinquennium Neronis to the eternal glory of
learned Governors, held on his honest and loyal course of good and free
Counsel, after his Master grew extremely corrupt in his government; neither
can this point otherwise be: for learning endueth men's minds with a true sense
of the ^railtie of their persons, the casualtie of their fortun^es, and the
dignity of their soul and vocation; so that it is impossible for them to
esteem that any greatness of their own fortune can be, a true or worthy end
of their being and ordainment; and therefore are desirous to give their account
to God, and so likewise to their Masters under God (as Kings and the States
that they serve) in these words; Ecce tibi lucrifeci, and not ^cce mihi
lucrifeci: whereas the corrupter sort of mere Politiques, that have not their
thoughts established by learning in the love and apprehension of duty, nor
never look abroad into universality; do refer all things to themselves,
and thrust themselves into the Center of the world, as if all lines should meet
in them and their fortunes; never caring in all tempests what becoms of the
ship of Estates, so they may save themselves in the Cockeboat of their own
fortune, whereas men that seele the weight of duty, and know the limits of
selfeloue, use to make good their places and duties, though with peril. And if
they stand in seditious and violent alterations; it is rather the reucrence
which many times both adverse parts doegiue to honesty, than any versatile
advantage of their own carriage. But for this point of tender sense, and ^ast
obligation of duty, which learning does endue the mind withal, howsoever
fortune may tax it, and many in the depth of their corrupt principles may
despise it yet it will receive an open allowance, and therefore needs the
less di^proofe or excusation.

Another fault incident commonly to learned men, which may be more probably
defended, than truly denied, is; that they fail sometimes in ap^lying
themselus to particular persons, which want of exact application ar^eth from
two causes: The one because the largeness of their mind can hardly confine it
self to dwell in the exquisite observation or examination of the nature and
customs of one person: for it is a speech for a Lover, and not for a wise man:
Satis magnum alter alteri Theat^um sumus^: Nevertheless I shall yield, that he
that cannot contract the sight of his mind, as well as disperse and dilate it,
wants a great sacultie. But there is a second cause, which is no inabilitie,
but a rejection upon choice and judgment. For the honest and just bounds of
observation, by one person upon another, extend no further, but to understand
him sufficiently, whereby not to give him offense, or whereby to be able to give
him faithful Counsel, or whereby to stand upon reasonable guard and caution in
respect of a man's self: But to be speculatiue into another man, to the end to
know how to work him, or wind him, or govern him, proceeds from a heart
that is double and cloven, and not entire and ingenuous; which as in friendship
it is want of integrity, so toward Princes or Superiors, is want of duty.
For the custom of the Leuant, which is, that subjects do forbear to gaze or
fix their eyes upon Princes, is in the outward Ceremony barbarous; but the
moral is good: For men ought not by cunning and bent observations to pierce
and penetrate into the hearts of Kings, which the scripture has declared to be
inscrutable.

There is yet another fault (with which I will conclude this part) which is
often noted in learned men, that they do many times fail to observe decency,
and discretion in their behavior and carriage, and commit errors in small and
ordinary points of action; so as the vulgar sort of Capacities, do make a
Judgment of them in greater matters, by that which they find wanting in them,
in smaller. But this consequence does often deceive men, for which, I do refer
them over to that which was said by Themistocles arrogantly, and vnciuily,
being applied to himself out of his own mouth, but being applied to the
general state of this question pertinently and justly; when being invited to
touch a Lute, he said: He could not fiddle, but he could make a small Town, a
great state. So no doubt, many may be well seen in the passages of government
and policy, which are to seek in little, and punctual occasions; I refer
them also to that, which Plato said of his Master Socrates, whom he compared
to the Gallypots of Apothecaries, which on the out side had Apes and Owls, and
Antiques, but contained with in sovereign and precious liquors, and
confections; acknowledging that to an external report, he was not without
superficial leuities, and deformities; but was inwardly replenished with
excellent virtues and powers. And so much touching the point of manners of
learned men.

But in the mean time, I have no purpose to give allowance to some conditions
and courses base, and unworthy, wherein diverse Professors of learning, have
wronged themselves, and gone too far; such as were those Trencher
Philosophers, which in the later age of the Roman State, were usually in the
houses of great persons, being little better than solemn Parasites; of which
kind, Lucian makes a merry description of the Philosopher, that the great
Lady took to ride with her in her Coach, and would needs have him carry her
little Dog, which he doing officiously, and yet uncomely, the Page scoffed.
and said: That he doubted, the Philosopher of a Stoike, would turn to be a
Cynike. But above all the rest, the gross and palpable flattery, whereunto
many (not unlearned) have abbased and abused their wits and pens, turning (as
Du Bartas says,) Hecuba into Helena, and Faustina into Lucretia, has most
diminished the price and estimation of Learning Neither is the moral
dedications of Books and Writings, as to Patrons to be commended: for that
Books (such as are worthy the name of Books) ought to have no Patrons, but
Truth and Reason: And the ancient custom was, to dedicate them only to private
and equal friends, or to entitle the Books with their Names, or if to Kings
and great persons, it was to some such as the argument of the Book was fit and
proper for; but these and the like Courses may deserve rather reprehension,
than defense.

Not that I can tax or condemn the morigeration or application of learned men
to men in fortune. For the answer was good that Diogenes made to one that
asked him in mockery, How it came to pass that Philosophers were the
followers of rich men, and not rich men of Philosophers? He answered soberly,
and yet sharply; Because the one sort knew what they had need of, and the
other did not; And of the like nature was the answer which Aristippus made,
when having a petition to Dionisius, and no ear given to him, he fell down at
his feet, wheupon Dionisius stayed, and gave him the hearing, and granted it,
and afterward some person tender on the behalf Philosophy, reproved
Aristippus, that he would offer the Profession of Philosophy such an
indignity, as for a private Suit to fall at a Tyrants feet: But he answered; It
was not his fault, but it was the fault of Dionisius, that had his ears in his
feet. Neither was it accounted weakness, but discretion in him that would
not dispute his best with Adrianus Caesar; excusing himself, That it was
reason to yield to him, that commanded thirty Legions. These and the like
applications and stooping to points of necessity and conuenience cannot be
disallowed: for though they may have some outward baseness; yet in a Judgment
truly made, they are to be accounted submissions to the occasion, and not to
the person.

Now I proceed to those errors and vanities, which have interueyned amongst
the studies themselves of the learned; which is that which is principal and
proper to the present argument, wherein my purpose is not to make a
justification of the errors, but by a censure and separation of the errors, to
make a justification of that which is good and sound; and to deliver that from
the aspersion of the other. For we see, that it is the manner of men, to
scandalize and deprave that which retains the state, and virtue, by taking
advantage upon that which is corrupt and degenerate; as the Heathens in the
primitive Church used to blemish and taynt the Christians, with the faults and
corruptions of Heretics: But nevertheless, I have no meaning at this time to
make any exact animaduersion of the errors and impediments in matters of
learning, which are more secret and remote from vulgar opinion; but only to
speak unto such as do fall under, or near unto, a popular observation.

There be therefore chiefly three vanities in Studies, whereby learning has
been most traduced: For those things we do esteem vain, which and either
false or frivolous, those which either have no truth, or no use: and those
persons we esteem vain, which are either credulous or curious, and curiosity
is either in matter or words; so that in reason, as well as in experience, there
fall out to be these 3. diste^pers (as I may term the^) of learning; The first
fantastical learning: The second contentious learning, and the last delicate
learning, vain Imaginations, vain Altercations, and vain affectatio^s: and
with the last I will begin, Martin Luther conducted (no doubt) by an higher
providence, but in discourse of reason, finding what a Province he had
undertaken against the Bishop of Rome, and the degenerate traditions of the
Church, and finding his own solitude, being no ways aided by the opinions of
his own time, was enforced to awake all Antiquity, and to call former times
to his succors, to make a party against the present time: so that the ancient
Authors, both in Divinity, and in Humanity, which had long time slept in
Libraries, began generally to be read and reuolued. This by consequence, did
draw on a necessity of a more exquisite travail in the languages original,
wherein those Authors did write: For the better understanding of those Authors,
and the better advantage of pressing and applying their words: And thereof grew
again, a delight in their manner of Style and Phrase, and an admiration of
that kind of writing; which was much furthered and precipitated by the enmity
and opposition, that the propounders of those (primitive, but seeming new
opinions) had against the Schoolmen: who were generally of the contrary
part: and whose Writings were altogether in a differing Style and form,
taking liberty to coin, and frame new terms of Art, to express their own
sense, and to avoid circuit of speech, without regard to the pureness,
pleasantness, and (as I may call it) lawfulness of the Phrase or word: And
again, because the great labor that then was with the people (of whom the
Pharisees were wont to say: Execrabilis ista turba quae non nouit legem) for
the winning and persuading of them, there grew of necessity in chief price,
and request, eloquence and variety of discourse, as the fittest and forciblest
access into the capacity of the vulgar sort: so that these four causes
concurring, the admiration of ancient Authors, the hate of the Schoolmen, the
exact study of Languages: and the efficacy of Preaching did bring in an
affectionate study of eloquence, and copy of speech, which then began to
flourish. This grew speedily to an excess: for men began to hunt more after
words, than matter, and more after the choisenesse of the Phrase, and the
round and clean composition of the sentence, and the sweet falling of the
clauses, and the varying and illustration of their works with tropes and
figures: then after the weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of
argument, life of invention, or depth of judgment. Then grew the flowing, and
watrie vain of Osorius the Portugal Bishop, to be in price: then did Sturmius
spend such infinite, and curious pains upon Cicero the Orator, and Hermog^nes
the Rhetorican, besides his own Books of Periods, and imitation, and the
like: Then did Car of Cambridge, and As^am with their Lectures and Writings,
almost diefie Cicero and Demosthenes, and allure, all young men that were
studious unto that delicate and pollished kind of learning. Then did Erasmus
take occasion to make the scoffing Echo; December annos consumpsi in legendo
Cicerone: and the Echo answered in Greek, Oue; Asine. Then grew the learning
of the Schoolmen to be utterly despised as barbarous. In sum, the whole
inclination and bent of those times, was rather toward copy, than weight.

Here therefore, the first distemper of learning, when men study words, and
not matter: whereof though I have represented an example of late times: yet it
has been, and will be Secundum maius and minus in all time. And how is it
possible, but this should have an operation to discredit learning, even with
vulgar capacities, when they see learned men's works like the first Letter of a
Patent, or limmed Book: which though it has large flourishes, yet it is but a
Letter. It seems to me that Pigmalions frenzy is a good emblem or
portraiture of this vanity: for words are but the Images of matter, and
except they have life of reason and invention: to fall in love with them, is
all one, as to fall in love with a Picture.

But yet notwithstanding, it is a thing not hastily to be condemned, to cloth
and adorn the the obscurity, even of Philosophy it self, with sensible and
plausible elocution. For hereof we have great examples in Xenophon, Cicero,
Seneca, Plutarch, and of Plato also in some degree, and hereof likewise there
is great use: For surely, to the severe inquisition of truth, and the deep
progress into Philosophy, it is some hindrance; because it is too early
satisfactorie to the mind of man, and quenches the desire of further search,
before we come to a just periode. But then if a man be to have any use of such
knowledge in civil occasions, of conference, counsel, persuasion, discourse,
or the like: Then shall he find it prepared to his hands in those Authors,
which write in that manner. But the excess of this is so justly contemptible,
that as Hercules, when he saw the Image of Adonis, Venus Mig^on in a Temple,
said in disdain, Nil sacri es. So there is none of Hercules followers in
learning, that is, the more severe, and laborious sort of Enquirers into truth,
but will despise those delicacies and affectations, as indeed capable of no
diuinesse. And thus much of the first disease or distemper of learning.

The second which follows is in nature; worse then (...) the former: for as
substance of matter is better than beauty of words: so contrariwise vain
matter is worse, than vain words: wherein it seems the reprehension of Saint
Paul, was not only proper for those times, but prophetical for the times
following, and not only respective to Divinity, but extensiue to all
knowledge. Deuita prophanas vocum nouitates and oppositiones falsinominis
scientiae. For he assigns two Marks and Badges of suspected and falsified
Science; The one, the novelty and strangeness of terms; the other, the
strictness of positions, which of necessity does induce oppositions, and so
questions and altercations. Surely, like as many substances in nature which are
solid, do putrify and corrupt into worms: So it is the property of good and
sound knowledge, to putrify and dissolve into a number of subtle, idle,
unwholesome, and (as I may term them) vermiculate questions; which have
indeed a kind of quickness, and life of spirit, but no soundness of
matter, or goodness of quality. This kind of degenerate learning did
chiefly reign amongst the Schoolmen, who having sharp and strong wits,
and abundance of leisure, and small variety of reading; but their wits being
shut up in the Cells of a few Authors (chiefly Aristotle their Dictator) as
their persons were shut up in the Cells of Monasteries and Colleges, and
knowing little History, either of Nature or time, did out of no great
quantity of matter, and infinite agitation of wit, spin out unto us those
laboriouswebbes of Learning which are extant i^ their Books. For the wit and
mind of man, if it work upon matter, which is the conte^plation of the
creatures of God works according to the stuff, and is limited thereby; but
if it work upon it self, as the Spider works his web, then it is
endless, (...) and brings forth indeed Copwebs of learning, admirable for the
finesse of thread and work, but of no substance or profit.

This same unprofitable subtilitie or curiosity is of two sorts: either in the
subject it self that they handle, when it is a fruitless speculation or
controversy; (whereof there are no small number both in Divinity and
Philosophy) or in the manner or method of handling of a knowledge; which
amongst them was this; upon every particular position or assertion to frame
objections, and to those obiectious, solutions: which solutions were for the
most part not confutations, but distinctions: whereas indeed the strength of
all Sciences, is as the strength of the old man's faggot in the bond. For the
harmony of a science supporting each part the other, is and ought to be the
true and brief confutation and suppression of all the smaller sort of
objections: but on the other side, if you take out every Axiom, as the
sticks of the faggot one by one, you may quarrel with them, and bend them and
break them at your pleasure: so that as was said of Seneca: Verborum minutijs
rerum frangit pondera: So a man may truly say of the School men Quaestionum
minutijs Scien^arum frangunt sodilitatem. For were it not better for a man in a
fair room, to set up one great light, or braunching candlestick of lights,
than to go about with a small watch candle into every corner? and such is
their method, that rests not so much upon evidence of truth proved by
arguments, authorities, similitudes, examples; as upon particular confutations
and solutions of every scruple, cauillation and objection: breeding for the
most part one question as fast as it solueth another; eue^ as in the former
resemblance, when you carry the light into one corner, you darken the rest: so
that the Fable and fiction of Scylla seems to be a lively Image of this kind
of Philosophy or knowledge, which was transformed into a comely Virgin for
the upper parts; but then; Candida succinctam, latran^ibus inguina monstris: So
the Generalities of the Schoolmen are for a while good and proportionable; but
then when you descend into their distinctions and decisions, in stead of a
fruitful womb, for the use and benefit of man's life; they end in monstrous
altercations and barking questions. So as it is not possible but this quality
of knowledge must fall under popular contempt, the people being apt to contemn
truth upon occasion of Controversies and altercations, and to think they are
all out of their way which never meet, and when they see such digladiation
about subtilties, and matter of no use nor moment, they easily fall upon that
judgment of Dionysius of Siracusa, Verba ista sunt senum ctiosorum.

Notwithstanding certain it is, that if those School men to their great
thirst of truth, and unwearied travail of wit, had joined variety and
universality of reading and contemplation, they had proved excellent Lights,
to the great advancement of all learning and knowledge: but as they are, they
are great undertakers indeed, and fierce with dark keeping. But as in the
inquiry of the divine truth, their pride inclined to leave the Oracle of Gods
word, and to vanish in the mixture of their own inventions: so in the
inquisition of Nature, they ever left the Oracle of Gods works, and adored the
deceiving and deformed Images, which the unequal mirror of their own minds,
or a few received Authors or principles, did represent unto them. And thus much
for the second disease of learning.

For the third vice or disease of Learning, which concerns deceit or untruth,
it is of all the rest the fowlest; as that which does destroy the essential
form of knowledge; which is nothing but a representation of truth; for the
truth of being, and the truth of knowing are one, differing no more than the
direct beam, and the beam reflected. This vice therefore brauncheth it self
into two sorts; delight in deceiving, and aptness to be deceived, imposture
and Credulity: which although they appear to be of a diverse nature, the one
seeming to proceed of cunning, and the other of simplicity; yet certainly,
they do for the most part concur: for as the verse notes.

Percontatorem fugito, nam Garrulus idem est:
An inquisiti^e man is a pratler: so upon the like reason, a credulous man is a
deceiuer: as we see it in same, that he that will easily believe rumors, will
as easily augment rumors, and add somewhat to them of his own, which Tacitus
wisely notes, when he says: Fingunt simul creduntque so great an affinity
has fiction and belief.

This facility of credit, and accepting or admitting things weakly
authorized or warranted, is of two kinds, according to the subject: For it is
either a belief of History, (as the Lawyers speak, matter of fact:) or else
of matter of art and opinion; As to the former, we see the experience and
inconvenience of this error in ecclesiastical History, which has too easily
received and registered reports and narrations of Miracles wrought by Martyrs,
Hermits, or Monks of the desert, and other holymen; and there Relics,
Shrines, Chapels, and Images: which though they had a passage for time, by the
ignorance of the people, the superstitious simplicity of some, and the
politic tolleration of others, holding them but as divine poesies: yet after
a periode of time, when the mist began to clear up, they grew to be esteemed,
but as old wives fables, impostures of the Clergy illusions of spirits, and
badges of Antichrist, to the great scandal and detriment of Religion.

So in natural History, we see there has not been that choice and
judgment used, as ought to have been, as may appear in the writings of
Plinius, Cardanus, Albertus, and diverse of the Arabians, being fraught with
much fabulous matter, a great part, not only untried, but notoriously untrue,
to the great derogation of the credit of natural Philosophy, with the grave
and sober kind of wits; wherein the wisdom and integrity of Aristotle is
worthy to be observed, that having made so diligent and exquisite a History of
living creatures, has mingled it sparingly with any vain or feigned matter,
and yet on the other sa^e, has cast all prodigious Narrations, which he thought
worthy the recording into one Book: excellently discerning that matter of
manifest truth, such whereupon observation and rule was to be built, was not
to be mingled or weakened with matter of doubtful credit: and yet again
that rarities and reports, that seem incredible, are not to be suppressed or
denied to the memory of men.

And as for the facility of credit which is yielded to Arts and opinions, it
is likewise of two kinds, either when too much belief is attributed to the
Arts themselves, or to certain Authors in any Art. The Sciences themselves
which have had better intelligence and confederacy with the imagination of
man, than with his reason, are three in number; Astrology, Natural Magic,
and Alcumy: of which Sciences nevertheless the ends or pretenses are noble.
For Astrology pretends to discover that correspondence or concatenation,
which is between the superior Globe and the inferior. Natural Magic
pretends to call and reduce natural Philosophy from variety of speculations
to the magnitude of works; And Alcumy pretends to make separation of all the
unlike parts of bodies, which in mixtures of nature are incorporate. But the
deriuations and prosecutions to these ends, both in the theories, and in the
practices are full of Error and vanity; which the great Professors themselves
have sought to veil over and conceal by euigmaticall writings, and referring
themselves to auricular traditions, and such other devises, to save the credit
of Impostures; and yet surely to Alcumy this right is due, that it may be
compared to the Husband man whereof Aesope makes the Fable; that when he died,
told his Sons, that he had left unto them gold, buried under ground in his
Vineyard; and they dug over all the ground, and gold they found none, but by
reason of their stirring and digging the mold about, the roots of their Vines,
they had a great Vintage the year following: so assuredly the search and
stir to make gold has brought to light a great number of good and fruitful
inventions and experiments, as well for the disclosing of Nature; as for the
use of man's life.

And as for the overmuch credit that has been given unto Authors in
Sciences, in making them Dictators, that their words should stand, and not
Counsels to give advise; the damage is infinite that Sciences have received
thereby, as the principal cause that has kept them low, at a stay without
grows or advancement. For hence it has comen, that in arts Mechanical, the
first deviser coms shortest, and time adds and perfecteth: but in Sciences
the first Author goes furthest, and time leeseth and corrupts. So we see,
Artillery, sailing, printing, and the like, were grossly managed at the first
and by time accommodated and refined: but contrary wise the Philosophies and
Sciences of Aristotle, Plato, Democritus, Hypocrates, Euclid^s, Archimedes, of
most vigor at the first, and by time degenerate and imbased, whereof the reason
is no other, but that in the former many wits and industries have (...)
contributed in one; and in the later many wits and industries have been spent
about the wit of some one; whom many times they have rather depraved than
illustrated. For as water will not ascend higher, than the level of the first
spring head, from whence it descends: so knowledge derived from Aristotle,
and exempted from liberty of examination, will not rise again higher, than
the knowledge of Aristotle. And therefore although the position be good: Oportet
discentem credere: yet it must be coupled with this, Oportet edoctum iudicare:
for Disciples do owe unto Masters only a temporary belief, and a
suspension of their own judgment, till they be fully instructed, and not an
absolute resignation, or perpetual captivity: and therefore to conclude this
point, I will say no more, but; so let great Authors have their due, as time
which is the Author of Authors be not deprived of his due, which is further and
further to discover truth. Thus have I gone over these three diseasses of
learning, besides the which there are some other rather peccant humors, then
fourmed diseases, which nevertheless are not so secret and intrinsike, but that
they fall under a popular observation and traducement; and therefore are not to
be passed over.

The first of these is the extreme affecting of two extreamities; The one
Antiquity, The other Nouelty; wherein it seems the children of time do take
after the nature and malice of the father. For as he deuowreth his children;
so one of them seeks to devour and suppress the other; while Antiquity
enuieth there should be new additions; and Nouelty cannot be content to add,
but it must deface; Surely the advice of the Prophet is the true direction in
this matter, State super vias antiquas, and videte quaenam sit via recta and
bona, and ambulate in ea. Antiquity deserves that reverence, that men should
make a stand thereupon, and discover what is the best way, but when the
discovery is well taken then to make progression. And to speak truly,
Antiquita seculi Iuuentus Mundi. These times are the ancient times when the
world is ancient, and not those which we count ancient Ordine retrogrado, by a
computacion backward from our selves.

Another Error induced by the former is a distrust that any thing should be
now to be found out which the world should have missed and passed over so long
time, as if the same objection were to be made to time, that Lucian makes to
Jupiter, and other the heathen Gods, of which he woondreth, that they begot so
many Children in old time, and begot none in his time, and asks whether they
were become septuagenarie, or whether the law Pappia made against old men's
marriages had restrained them. So it seems men doubt, least time is become
past children and generation; wherein contrary wise, we see commonly the
leuitie and inconstancy of men's judgments, which till a matter be done,
wonder that it can be done; and as soon as it is done, wonder again that it
was no sooner done, as we see in the expedition of Alexander into Asia, which
at first was preiudged as a vast and impossible enterprise; and yet afterward
it pleases Liuye to make no more of it, than this, Nil aliud quam been ausus
vana contemnere. And the same happened to Columbus in the western Navigations.
But in intellectual matters, it is much more common; as may be seen in most of
the propositions of Euclyde, which till they be demonstrate, they seem
strange to our assent; but being demonstrate, our mind accepts of them by a
kind of relation (as the Lawyers speak) as if we had known them before.

Another Error that has also some affinity with the former, is a conceit
that of former opinions or sects after variety and examination, the best has
still prevailed; and suppressed the rest; So as if a man should begin the
labor of a new search, he were but like to light upon somewhat formerly
rejected; and by reiection, brought into oblivion; as if the multitude, or the
wisest for the multitudes sake, were not ready to give passage, rather to that
which is popular and superficial, than to that which is substantial and
profound; for the truth is, that time seems to be of the nature of a River,
or stream, which carries down to us that which is light and blown up; and
sinketh and drowneth that which is weighty and solid.

Another Error of a diverse nature from all the former, is the ouer-early and
peremptory reduction of knowledge into Artsand Methodes: from which time,
commonly Sciences receive small or no augmentation. But as young men, when they
knit and shape perfectly, doeseldome grow to a further stature: so knowledge,
while it is in Aphorisms and observations, it is in grows; but when it once
is comprehended inexact Methodes; it may perchance be further pollished and
illustrate, and accommodated for use and practice; but it increases no more in
bulk and substance.

Another Error which does succeed that which we last mentioned, is, that after
the distribution of particular Arts and Sciences, men have abandoned
universality, or Philosophia prima; which cannot but cease, and stop all
progression. For no perfect discovery can be made upon a slatte, or a
level. Neither is it possible to discover the more remote, and deeper parts of
any Science, if you stand but upon the level of the same Science, and ascend
not to a higher Science.

Another Error has proceeded from too great a reverence, and a kind of
adoration of the mind and understanding of man^ by means whereof, men have
withdrawn themselves too much from the contemplation of Nature, and the
observations of experience: and have tumbled up and down in their own reason
and conceits: upon these Intellectuallists, which are notwithstanding commonly
taken for the most sublime and divine Philosophers; Heraclitus gave a just
censure, saying: Men sought truth in their own little worlds, and not in the
great and common world: for they disdain to spell, and so by degrees to read
in the volume of Gods works, and contrariwise by continual meditation and
agitation of wit, do urge, and as it were invoke their own spirits, to
divine, and give Oracles unto them, whereby they are deservedly deluded.

Another Error that has some connection with this later, is, that men have used
to infect their meditations, opinions, and doctrines with some conceits which
they have most admired, or some Sciences which they have most applied; and
given all things else a tincture according to them, utterly untrue and
improper. So has Plato intermingled his Philosophy with Theology, and
Aristotle with Logic, and the second School of Plato, Proclus, and the rest,
with the Mathematiques. For these were the Arts which had a kind of Primo
geniture with them severally. So have the Alchymists made a Philosophy out of
a few experiments of the Furnace; and Gilbertus our Country man has made a
Philosophy out of the observations of a Loadstone. So Cicero, when reciting
the several opinions of the nature of the soul, he found a Musician, that
held the soul was but a harmony, says pleasantly: Hic ab art sua non
recessit, etc. But of these conceits Aristotle speaks seriously and wisely,
when he says: Qui recipient ad pauca'de facili pronuntiant.

Another Error is an impatience of doubt, and have to assertion without due
and mature suspention of judgment. For the two ways of contemplation are not
unlike the two ways of action, commonly spoken of by the Ancients. The one
plain and smooth in the beginning, and in the end impassable: the other rough
and troublesome in the entrance, but after a while fair and even, so it is in
cotemplation, if a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts;
but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.

Another Error is in the manner of the tradition and delivery of knowledge,
which is for the most part Magistrall and peremptory; and not ingenuous and
faithful, in a sort, as may be soonest believed; and not easilest examined. It
is true, that in compendious Treatises for practice, that form is not to be
disallowed. But in the true handling of knowledge, men ought not to fall either
on the one side into the vein of Velleius the Epicurean: Nil tam metuen^, quam
ne dubitare aliqua de re videretur; Nor on the other side into Socrates his
irronicall doubting of all things, but to propound things sincerely, with more
or less asseueration: as they stand in a man's own judgment, proved more or
less.

Other Errors there are in the scope that men propound to themselves, whereunto
they bend their endeauours: for whereas the more constant and deuote kind of
Professors of any science ought to propound to themselves, to make some
additions to their Science; they convert their labors to aspire to certain
second Prizes; as to be a profound Interpreter or Co^menter; to be a sharp
Champion or Defender; to be a methodicall Compounder or abridger; and so the
Patrimony of knowledge comes to be sometimes improoued: but seldom
augmented.

But the greatest Error of all the rest, is the mistaking or misplacing of the
last or furthest end of knowledge: for men have entered into a desire of
Learning and knowledge, sometimes upon a natural curiosity, and inquisitiue
appetite; sometimes to entertain their minds with variety and delight;
sometimes for ornament and reputation; and sometimes to enable them to victory
of wit and contradiction, and most times for lukar and profession, and seldom
sincerely to give a true account of their guist of reason, to the benefit and
use of men: As if there were sought in knowledge a Cowch, whereupon to rest a
searching and restless spirit; or a tarras^e for a wandering and variable
mind, to walk up and down with a fair prospect; or a Tower of State for a
proud mind to raise it self upon; or a Fort or commanding ground for strife
and contention, or a Shop for profit or sale; and not a rich Storehouse for
the glory of the Creator, and the relief of Man's estate. But this is that,
which will indeed dignifie and exalt knowledge; if contemplation and action may
be more nearly and straightly conjoined and united together, than they have
been; a Conjunction like unto that of the two highest Planets, Saturn the
Planet of rest and contemplation; and Jupiter the Planet of civil society and
action. Howbeit, I do not mean when I speak of use and action, that end
before mentioned of the applying of knowledge to ^uker and profession; For I am
not ignorant how much that diuerteth and interrupteth the prosecution and
advancement of knowledge; like unto the goulden ball thrown before Atalanta,
which while she goes aside, and stoopeth to take up, the race is hindered,

Declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit:
Neither is my meaning as was spoken of Socrates, to call Philosophy down from
heaven to converse upon the earth, that is, to leave natural Philosophy aside,
and to apply knowledge only to manners, and policy. But as both heaven and
earth do conspire and contribute to the use and benesite of man: So the end
ought to be from both Philosophies, to separate and reject vain speculations,
and whatsoever is empty and void, and to preserve and augment whatsoever is
solid and fruitful: that knowledge may not be as a Curtezan for pleasure,
and vanity only, or as a bondwoman to acquire and gain to her Masters use,
but as a Spouse, for generation, fruit, and comfort.

Thus have I described and opened as by a kind of dissection, those peccant
humors (the principal of them) which has not only given impediment to the
proficience of Learning, but have given also occasion, to the traducement
thereof: wherein if I have been too plain, it must be remembered; Fideli^
vulnera amantis, sed dolosa oscula malignantis. This I think I have gained,
that I ought to be the better believed, in that which I shall say pertaining
to commendation: because I have proceeded so freely, in that which concerns
censure. And yet I have no purpose to enter into a laudatiue of Learning, or to
make a Hymn to the Muses (though I am of opinion, that it is long since their
Rites were duly celebrated) but my intent is without varnish or amplification,
justly to weigh the dignity of knowledge in the balance with other things,
and to take the true value thereof by testimonies and arguments divine, and
humane.

First therefore, let us seek the dignity of knowledge in the Arch-tipe or
first plat form, which is is in the attributes and acts of God, as far as
they are revealed to man, and may be observed with sobriety, wherein we may
not seek it bythe name of Learning, for all learning is knowledge acquired,
and all knowledge in God is original. And therefore we must look for it by
another name, that of wisdom or sapience, as the scriptures call it.

It is so then, that in the work of the Creation, we see a double emanation of
virtue from God: the one referring more properly to power, the other to
wisdom, the one expressed in making the subsistence of the matter, and the
other in disposing the beauty of the form. This being supposed, it is to be
observed, that for any thing which appears in the history of the Creation,
the confused Mass, and matter of heaven and earth was made in a moment, and
the order and disposition of that Chaos or Mass, was the work of six days,
such a note of difference it pleased God to put upon the works of power, and
the works of wisdom: wherewith concurreth that in the former, it is not
set down, that God said, Let there be Heaven and Earth, as it is set down
of the works following, but actually, that God made Heaven and earth: the one
carrying the style of a Manufacture, and the other of a law, decree, or
Council.

To proceed to that which is next in order from God to spirits: we find as
far as credit is to be given to the celestial Hierarchye, of that supposed
Dionysius the Senator of Athens the first place or degree is given to the
Angels of love, which are termed Seraphim, the second to the Angels of light,
which are termed Cherubim, and the third; and so following places to thrones,
principalities, and the rest, which are all Angels of power and ministry; so as
the Angels of knowledge and illumination, are placed before the Angels of
Office and domination.

To descend from spirits and intellectual sormes to sensible and material
fourmes, we read the first form that was created, was light, which has a
relation and correspondence in nature and corporal things, to knowledge in
spirits and incorporall things.

So in the distribution of days, we see the day wherein God did rest, and
conte^plate his own works, was blessed above all the days, wherein he did
effect and accomplish them.

After the Creation was finished, it is set down unto us, that man was
placed in the Garden to work therein, which work so appointed to him, could
be no other than work of contemplation, that is, when the end of work is but
for exercise and experiment, not for necessity, for there being then no
reluctation of the creature, nor sweat of the browe, man's employment must of
consequence have been matter of delight in the experiment and not matter of
labor for the use. Again the first Acts which man persourmed in Paradise,
consisted of the two summarie parts of knowledge, the view of Creatures, and
the imposition of names. As for the knowledge which induced the fall, it was,
as was touched before, not the natural knowledge of Creatures, but the moral
knowledge of good and evil, wherein the supposition was, that Gods
commandments or prohibitions were not the originals of good and evil, but
that they had other beginnings which man aspired to know, to the end, to make a
total defection from God, and to depend wholly upon himself.

To pass on, in the first event or occurrence after the fall of Man; we see
(as the Scriptures have infinite Mysteries, not violating at all the truth of
the Story or letter) an Image of the two Estates, the Contemplative state, and
the active state, figured in the two persons of Abell and Cain, and in the two
simplest and most primitive Trades of life: that of the Shepherd (who by
reason of his leisure, rest in a place, and living in view of heaven, is a
lively Image of a contemplative life) and that of the husbandman; where we see
again, the favor and election of God went to the Shepherd, and not to the
tiller of the ground.

So in the age before the flood, the holy Records within those few memorials,
which are there entered and registered, have vouchsafed to mention, and honor
the name of the Inuentors and Authors of Music, and works in metal. In the
age after the Flood, the first great judgment of God upon the ambition of
man, was the confusion of tongues; whereby the open Trade and intercourse of
Learning and knowledge, was chiefly imbarred.

To descend to Moses the Lawgiver, and Gods first pen; he is adorned by
the Scriptures with this addition, and commendation: That he was seen in all
the Learning of the Egyptians; which Nation we know was one of the most
ancient Schools of the world: for, so Plato brings in the Egyptian Priest,
saying unto Solon: You Grecians are ever Children, you have no knowledge of
antiquity, nor antiquity of knowledge. Take a view of the ceremonial law of
Moses; you shall find besides the prefiguration of Christ, the badge or
difference of the people of God, the exercise and impression of obedience, and
other divine uses and fruits thereof, that some of the most learned Rabynes
have travailed profitably, and profoundly to observe, some of them a natural,
some of them a moral sense, or reduction of many of the ceremonies and
ordinances: As in the law of the Leprousie, where it is said: If the
whiteness hau^ over spread the flesh, the Patient may pass abroad for clean;
But if there be any whole flesh remaining, he is to be shut up for unclean:
One of them notes a principle of nature, that putrefaction is more contagious
before maturitie than after: And another notes a position of moral
Philosophy, that men abandoned to vice, do not so much corrupt manners, as
those that are half good, and half evil, so, in this and very many other
places in that law, there is to be found besides the Theological sense, much
aspersion of Philosophy.

So likewise in that excellent Book of Job, if it be re^olued with diligence,
it will be found pregnant, and swelling with natural Philosophy; as for
example, Cosmographie, and the roundnesse of the world: Qui extendit aquilonem
super vacuum, and appendit terram super nihilum: wherein the pensilenesse of
the earth, the pole of the North, and the finitenesse, or conuexitie of Heaven
are manifestly touched. So again matter of Astronomy; Spiritus eius ornauit
coelos and obstetricante manu eius eductus est coluber tortuosus: And in
another place, Nunquid coniungere valebis micantes stellds pleyadas, aut gyrum
arcturi poteris dissipare? where the fixing of the stars, ever standing at
equal distance, is with great elegancie noted: And in another place, Qui
fa^arcturum, and ^ona, and hyadas, and interiora austri, where again he takes
knowledge of the depression of the Southern pole, calling it the secrets of
the South, because the southern stars were in that climate unseen. Matter
of generation, Annon si ut lac mulsisti me, and sicut caseum coagulasti me,
etc. Matter of Mynerals, Habet argentum venarum suarum principia and aurolocus
est in quo con^latur ferr^m de t^rra tollitur, and lapis solutus calore in
(...) verti^r: and so forwards in that Chapter.

So likewise in the person of Solomon the King, we see the guist or endowment
of wisdom and learning both in Salomons petition, and in Gods assent
thereunto preferred before all other terrene and temporal selicitie. By virtue
of which grant or donatiue of God, Solomon became enabled, not only to write
those excellent Parables, or Aphorisms concerning divine and moral
Philosophy; but also to compile a natural History of all verdor, from the
Cedar upon the Mountain, to the moss upon the wall, (which is but a rudiment
between putrefaction, and an herb) and also of all things, that breath or
moon. Nay the same Solomon the King, although he excelled in the glory of
treasure and magnificent buildings of shipping and Navigations, of service and
attendance, of same and renown, and the like; yet he makes no claim to any
of those glories; but only to the glory of Inquisition of truth: for so he
says expressly: The glory of God is to conceal a thing, But the glory of
the King is to find it out, as if according to the innocent play of Children
the divine Majesty took delight to hide his works, to the end to have them
sound out, and as if Kings could not obtain a greater honor, than to be
Gods playfellowes in that game, considering the great commandment of wits and
means, whereby nothing needs to be hidden from them.

Neither did the dispensation of God vary in the times after our Savior came
into the world; for our Savior himself did first show his power to subdue
ignorance, by his conference with the Priests and Doctors of the law; before
he showed his power to subdue nature by his miracles. And the coming of the
holy spirit, was chiefly figured and expressed in the similitude and guist of
tongues; which are but Vehicula scientiae.

So in the election of those Instruments, which it pleased God to use for the
plantation of the faith, notwithstanding, that at the first hedid employ
persons altogether unlearned, otherwise than by inspiration, more evidently to
declare his immediate working, and to abbase all humane wisdom or knowledge;
yet nevertheless, that Counsel of his was no sooner performed, but in the
next vicissitude and succession, he did send his divine truth into the world,
waited on with other Learnings as with Servants or Handmaides: For so we see
Saint Paul, who was only learned amongst the Apostles, had his pen most used
in the scriptures of the new Testament.

So again, we find that many of the ancient Bishops and Father of the Church,
were excellently read, and studied in all the learning of the Heathen,
insomuch, that the Edict of the Emperor Iulianus (whereby it was interdicted
unto Christians to be admitted into Schools, Lectures, or exercises of
learning) was esteemed and accounted a more pernicious engine and machination
against the Christian faith; than were all the sanguinarie prosecutions of his
Predecessors; Neither could the emulation and Jealousy of Gregory the first
of that name, Bishop of Rome, ever obtain the opinion of piety or devotion:
but contrariwise received the censure of humor, malignitie, and
pusillanimitie, even amongst holy men: in that he designed to obliterate and
extinguish the memory of Heathen antiquity and Authors. But contrarewise it
was the Christian Church, which amidst the inundations of the Scythians, on the
one side from the Northwest: and the Saracens from the East, did preserve in
the sacred lap and bosom thereof, the precious Relics, even of Heathen
Learning, which otherwise had been extinguished, as if no such thing had ever
been.

And we see before our eyes, that in the age of our selves, and our Fathers,
when it pleased God to call the Church of Rome to account, for their degenerate
manners and ceremonies: and sundry doctrines, obnoxious, and framed to uphold
the same abuses: At one and the same time, it was ordained by the divine
providence, that there should attend withal a renouation, and new spring of
all other knowledges: And on the other side, we see the Jesuits, who partly in
themselves, and partly by the emulation and provocation of their example, have
much quickened and strengthened the state of Learning: we see (Isay) what notable
service and reparation they have done to the Roman Sea.

Wherefore to conclude this part, let it be observed, that there be two
principal duties and services besides ornament and illustration, which
Philosophy and humane learning do perform to faith and Religion. The one,
because they are an effectual inducement to the exaltation of the glory of
God. For as the Psalms, and other Scriptures do often inuit us to consider,
and magnify the great and wonderful works of God so if we should rest only
in the contemplation of the exterior of them, as they first offer themselves to
our senses; we should do a like injury unto the Majesty of God, as if we
should judge or construe of the store of some excellent Ieweller, by that only
which is set out toward the street in his shop. The other, because they
minister a singular help and preservative against unbelief and error; For our
Savior says, You err not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God:
laying before us two Books or volumes to study, if we will be secured from
error: first the scriptures, revealing the will of God; and then the creatures
expressing his power; whereof the later is a key unto the former; not only
opening our understanding to conceive the true sense of the scriptures, by the
general notions of reason and rules of speech; but chiefly opening our
belief, in drawing us into a due meditation of the omnipotency of God, which
is chiefly signed and engraven upon his works. Thus much therefore for
diuinetestimonie and evidence, concerning the true dignity, and value of
learning.

As for humane proofs, it is so large a field, as in a discourse of this
nature and brevity, it is fit rather to use choice of those things, which we
shall produce, than to embrace the variety of them. First therefore in the
degrees of humane honor amongst the heathen, it was the highest, to obtain to
a veneration and adoration as a God. This unto the Christians is as the
forbidden fruit. But we speak now separately of humane testimony; according
to which, that which the Grecians call Apotheosis, and the Latins, Relatio
inter dives, was the supreme honor, which man could attribute unto man;
specially when it was given, not by a formal Decree or Act of State, as it was
used amongst the Roman Emperors; but by an inward assent and belief; which
honor being so high, had also a degree or middle term: for there were
reckoned above humane honors, honor heroycall and divine: In the attribution,
and distribution of which honors; we see Antiquity made this difference:
that whereas founders and vniters of States and Cities, Law-giuers, extirpers
of Tyrants, Fathers of the people, and other eminent persons in civil merit,
were honored but with the titles of Worthies or Demy-Gods: such as were
Hercules, Theseus, Minos, Romulus, and the like: on the other side, such as
were Inuentors and Authors of new Arts, endowments, and commodities toward
man's life, were ever consecrated amongst the Gods themselves, as was Ceres,
Bacchus, Mercurius, Apollo, and others, and justly: for the merit of the former
is confined within the circle of an age, or a nation: and is like fruitful
showers, which though they be profitable and good: yet serve but for that
season, and for a latitude of ground where they fall: But the other is indeed
like the benefits of Heaven, which are permanent and universal. The former
again is mixed with strife and perturbation; but the later has the true
Caracter of divine presence comin aura leni, without noise or agitation.

Neither is certainly that other merit of learning, in repressing the
inconveniences which grow from man to man; much inferior to the former, of
relieuing the necessities which arise from nature; which merit was lively set
forth by the Ancients in that feigned relation of Orpheus Theater; where all
beasts and birds assembled (...) and forgetting their several appetites; some
of pray, some of game, some of quarrel, stood all sociably together listening
unto the airs and accords of the Harp; the sound whereof no sooner ceased, or
was drowned by some louder noise; but every beast returned to his own nature;
wherein is aptly described the nature and condition of men; who are full of
savage and vnreclaymed desires; of profit, of lust, of revenge; which as long
as they give ear to precepts, to laws, to religion, swee^ (...) eloquence and
persuasion of Books, of Sermons, of haranges; so long is society and peace
maintained; but if these instruments be silent; or that sedition and tumult
make them not audible; all things dissolve into Anarchie and Confusion.

But this appears more manifestle, when Kings themselves, or persons of
authority under them or other Governors in common wealths, and popular
Estates, are endued with Learning. For although he might be thought partial to
his own profession, that said, Then should people and estates be happy, when
either Kings were Philosophers, or Philosophers Kings: yet so much is verified
by experience; that under learned Princes and Governors, there have been ever
the best times; for howsoever Kings may have their imperfections in their
passions and Customs; yet if they be illuminate by learning, they have those
Notions of Religion, policy, and morality; which do preserve them, and
refrain them from all ruinous and peremptory errors and excesses; whispering
evermore in their ears, when Counselors and servants stand mute, and silent;
and Senators, or Counselors likewise, which be learned, do proceed upon
more safe and substantial principles; then Counselors which are only men of
experience; the one sort keeping dangers a far off; whereas the other
discover them not, till they come near hand: and then trust to the agilitie of
their wit, to ward or avoid them.

Which felicity of times, under learned Princes, (to keep still the Law of
brevity, by using the most eminent and selected examples) does best appear in
the age, which passed from the death of Domitianus the Emperor, until the
reign of Commodus: comprehending a succession of six Sciences, all learned or
singular favorers and Aduancers of learning: which age for temporal respects,
was the most happy and flourishing, that ever the Roman Empire, (which then
was a modele of the world) enjoyed: a matter revealed and prefigured unto
Do^itian in a Dream, the night before he was slain; for he thought there was
grown behind upon his shoulders, a neck and a head of gould, which came
accordingly to pass, in those golden times which succeeded; of which Princes,
we will make some commemoration: wherein although the matter will be vulgar,
and may be thought fitter for a Declamation, then agreeable to a Treatise
infolded as this is; yet because it is pertinent to the point in hand, Neque
semper arcum tendit Apollo, and to name them only were too naked and cursorie,
I will not omit it altogether. The first was Nerua, the excellent temper of
whose government, is by a glaunce in Cornelius Tacitus touched to the life:
Postquam diuus Ne^res olim insociab^les mis^uisset, imperiu^ and libertatem:
And in token of his learning, the last Act of his short reign lest to memory,
was a missiue to his adopted son Traian, proceeding upon some inward
discontent, at the ingratitude of the times, comprehended in a verse of Homers,

Telis Phoebe, ^uis, Lachrymas ulciscere nostras.
Traian, who succeeded, was for his person not learned: But if we will hearken
to the speech of our Savior, that says, He that receives a Prophet in the
name of a Prophet, shall have a Prophets reward, he deserves to be placed
amongst the most learned Princes: for there was not a greater admirer of
learning or Benefactor of Learning, a founder of famous Libraries, a perpetual
Aduancer of learned men to office, and a familiar conuerser with learned
Professors and Preceptors, who were noted to have then most credit in Court.
On the other side, how much Traians virtue and government was admired and
renowned, surely no testimony of grave and faithful History does more lively
set forth, than that legend tale of Gregorius Magnus, Bishop of Rome, who was
noted for the extreme envy he bare toward all Heathen excellency: and yet he
is reported out of the love and estimation of Traians moral virtues, to have
made unto God, passionate and fervent prayers, for the delivery of his soul
out of Hell: and to have obtained it with a Caveat that he should make no more
such petitions. In this Princes time also, the persecutions against the
Christians received intermission, upon the certificate of Plin us secundus, a
man of excellent learning, and by Traian advanced.

Adrion his successor, was the most curious man that lived, and the most
universal enquirer: insomuch as it was noted for an error in his mind: that he
desired to comprehend all things, and not to reserve himself for the
worthyest things, falling into the like humor that was long before noted in
Phillip and Macedon, who when he would needs overrule and put down an
excellent Musician, in an argument touching Music, was well answered by him
again, God forbid Sir (says he) that your for tune should be so bad, as to
know these things better than I; It pleased God likewise to use the curiosity
of this Emperor, as an inducement to the peace of his Church in those days:
for having Christ in veneration, not as a God or Savior, but as a wonder or
novelty: and having his picture in his Gallerie, matched with Apollon^us (with
whom in his vain imagination, he thought he had some conformity) yet it
served the turn to allay the bitter hatred of those times against the
Christian name: so as the Church had peace during his time, and for his
government civil, although he did not attain to that of Traians, in glory
of Arms, or perfection of Justice: yet in deserving of the weal of the
Subject, he did exceed him. For Traianc erected many famous monuments and
buildings, insomuch as Constantine the Great, in emulation was wont to call
him Parietaria, Wall flower, because his name was upon so many walls: but his
buildings and works were more of glory and triumph, than use and necessity:
But Adrian spent his whole Reign, which was peaceable in a perambulation, or
Survey of the Roman Empire, giving order and making assignation, where he went
for reedifying of Cities, Towns, and Forts decayed: and for cutting of Rivers,
and streams: and for making Bridges and passages, and for pollicing of Cities,
and Commonalties, with new ordinances and constitutions: and granting new
Franchises and incorporations: so that his whole time was a very restoration
of all the lapses and decays of former times.

Antonius Pius, who succeeded him, was a Prince excellently learned; and had
the Patient and subtle wit of a School man: insomuch as in common speech,
(which leaves no virtue vntaxed) he was called Cymini Sector, a caruer, or a
diuider of Comine seed, which is one of the least seeds: such a patience he
had and settled spirit, to enter into the least and most exact differences of
causes: a fruit no doubt of the exceeding tranquillity, and serenitie of his
mind; which being no ways charged or incombred, either with fears, remorses,
or scruples, but having been noted for a man of the purest goodness without
all fiction or affectation, that has reigned or lived: made his mind
contitinually present and entier: he likewise approached a degree nearer unto
Christianity, and became as Agrippa said unto S. Paul, Half a Christian;
holding their Religion and Law in good opinion: and not only ceasing
persecution, but giving way to the advancement of Christians.

There succeeded him the first Diui fratres, the two adoptiue brethren, Lucius
Commodus Verus, Son to Elius Verus, who delighted much in the softer kind of
learning: and was wont to call the Poet Martial his Virgill: and Marcus
Aurelius Antoninus, whereof the later, who obscured his colleague, and suruiued
him long, was named the Philosopher: who as he excelled all the rest in
learning, so he excelled them likewise in perfection of all royal virtues:
insomuch as Iulianus the Emperor in his book entitled, Caesares, being as a
Pasquill or Satyr, to deride all his Predecessors, feigned that they were all
invited to a banquet of the Gods, and Sylenus the Iester sat at the nether
end of the table, and bestowed a scoff on every one as they came in, but when
Marcus Philosophus came in, Sylenus was grauelled, and out of countenance, not
knowing where to carpe at him, save at the last, he gave a glaunce at his
patience toward his wife. And the virtue of this Prince continued with that of
his Predecessor made the name of Antoninus so sacred in the world, that though
it were extremely dishonored in Commodus, Carocolla, and Haeliogabalus, who
all bare the name, yet when Alexander Seuerus refused the name, because he was
a stranger to the family, the Senate with one acclamation said, Quomodo
Augustus sic and Antoninus. In such renown and veneration, was the name of
these two Princes in those days, that they would have had it as a perpetual
addition in all the Emperors style. In this Emperors time also, the Church
for the most part was in peace, so as in this sequence of six Princes, we do
see the blessed effects of Learning in sovereignty, painted forth in the
greatest Table of world.

But for a Tablet or picture of smaller volume (not presuming to speak of your
Majesty that lives) in my judgment the most excellent, is that of Queen
Elizabeth, your immediate Predecessor in this part of Britain, a Prince, that
if Plutarch were now alive to write lines by parallells, would trouble him I
think, to find for her a parallel amongst women. This Lady was endued with
learning in her sex singular; and grace even amongst masculine Princes:
whether we speak of Learning, of Language, or of science, modern, or ancient:
Divinity or Humanity. And unto the very last year of her life, she
accustomed to appoint set hours for reading, scarcely any young Student in an
University, more daily, or more duly. As for the government, I assure my
self, I shall not exceed, if I do affirm, that this part of the Island, never
had 45. years of better times; and yet not through the calmnesse of the season;
but through the wisdom of her regiment. For if there be considered of the one
side, the truth of Religion established; the constant peace and security: the
good administration of Justice, the temperate use of the prerogative, not
slackened, nor much strayned: the flourishing state of Learning, sortable to so
excellent a Patroness; the convenient estate of wealth and means, both of
Crown and subject: the habit of obedience, and the moderation of discontents:
and there be considered on the other side, the differences of Religion, the
troubles of Neighbor Countries, the ambition of Spain, and opposition of
Rome, and then, that she was solitary, and of her self: these things I say
considered: as I could not have chosen an instance so recent and so proper: so,
I suppose, I could not have chosen one more remarqueable, or eminent, to the
purpose now in hand; which is concerning the conjunction of learning in the
Prince, with felicity in the people.

Neither has Learning an influence and operation only upon civil merit and
moral virtue; and the Arts or temperature of peace, and peaceable government;
but likewise it has no less power and efficacy in inablement toward
martial and military virtue and prowess; as may be notably represented in
the examples of Alexander the Great, and Caesar the Dictator mentioned before,
but now in fit place to be resumed, of whose virtues and Acts in war, there
needs no note or recital, having been the wonders of time in that kind. But
of their affections toward learning, and perfections in learning, it is
pertinent to say somewhat.

Alexander was bred and taught under Aristotle the great Philosopher; who
dedicated diverse of his Books of Philosophy unto him; he was attended with
Callisthenes, and diverse other learned persons, that followed him in Camp,
throughout his Iourneyes and Conquests: what price and estimation he had
learning in, does notably appear in these three particulars: First, in the
envy he used to express, that he bare toward Achilles, in this, that he had
so good a Trumpet of his praises as Homers verses: Secondly, in the judgment
or solution he gave touching that precious Cabinet of Darius which was found
among his Jewels, whereof question was made, what thing was worthy to be put
into it, and he gave his opinion for Homers works. Thirdly, in his letter to
Aristotle after he had set sorth his Books of Nature; wherein he
expostulateth with him for publishing the secrets or mysteries of Philosophy,
and gave him to understand that himself esteemed it more to excel other men
in learning and knowledge, than in power and Empire. And what use he had of
learning, does appear, or tather shine in all his speeches and answers, being
full of science and use of science, and that in all variety.

And herein again, it may seem a thing scholasticall, and somewhat idle to
recite things that every man knows; but yet, since the argument I handle
leads me thereunto, I am glad that men shall perceive I am as willing to
flatter (if they will so call it) an Alexander, or a Caesar, or an Antoninus,
that are dead many hundredth years since, as any that now lives: for it is the
displaying of the glory of Learning in Sovereignty that I propound to my
self, and not an humor of declayming in any man's praises. Observe then the
speech he used of Diogenes, and see if it tend not to the true state of one of
the greatest questions of moral Philosophy; whether the enjoying of outward
things, or the contemning of them be the greatest happiness; for when he saw
Diogenes so perfectly contented with so little: he said to those that mocked at
his condition: Were I not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes. But Seneca
inuerteth it, and says; Plus erat, quod hic nollet accipere, quam quod ille
posset dare. There were more things which Diogenes would have refused, tha^
those were which Alexander could have given or enjoyed.

Observe again that speech which was usual with him, That he felt his
mortality chiefly in two things, Sleep and Lust: and see if it were not a
speech extracted out of the depth of natural Philosophy, and liker to have
comen out of the mouth of Aristotle, or Democritus, than from Alexander.

See again that speech of Humanity and poesy: when upon the bleeding of his
wounds, he called unto him one of his flatterers, that was wont to ascribe to
him divine honor, and said, Look, this is very blood: this is not such a
liquor as Homer speaks of, which ran from Venus hand, when it was pierced by
Diomedes.

See likewise his readiness in reprehension of Logique, in the speech he used
to Cassander, upon a complaint that was made against his Father Antipater: for
when Alexander happed to say: Do you think these men would have come from so
far to complain, except they had just cause of grief? and Cassander
answered, Yea, that was the matter, because they thought they should not be
disprooued; said Alexander laughing: See the subtil^ies of Aristotle, to take a
matter both ways, Pro and Contra, etc.

But note again how well he could use the same Art, which he reprehended to
serve his own humor, when bearing a secret grudge to Callisthenes, because he
was against the new ceremony of his adoration: feasting one night, where the
same Callisthenes was at the table: it was moved by some after supper, for
entertainment sake, that Callisthenes who was an eloquent man, might speak of
some theme or purpose at his own choice, which Callisthenes did; choosing the
praise of the Macedonian Nation for his discourse, and performing the same with
so good manner, as the hearers were much ravished: whereupon Alexander nothing
pleased, said: It was easy to be eloquent, upon so good a subject: But says
he, Turn your style, and let us hear what you can say against us: which
Callisthenes presently undertook, and did with that stinge and life; that
Alexander interrupted him, and said: The goodness of the cause made him
eloquent before: and dispig^t made him cloquent then again.

Consider further, for tropes of Rhetorique, that excellent use of a Metaphor
or translation, wherewith he taxed Antipater, who was an imperious and
tyrannous Governor: for when one of Antipaters friends commended him to
Alexander for his moderation; that he did not degenerate, as his other
Lieftenants did into the Persian pride, in use of purple; but kept the ancient
habit of Macedon, of black; True (says Alexander) but Antipater is all purple
within. Or that other, when Parmenio came to him in the plain of Arbella, and
showed him the innumerable multitude of his enemies, specially as they appeared
by the infinite number of lights; as it had been a new firmament of stars;
and thereupon advised him to assail them by night; whereupon he answered, That
he would not steal the Victory.

For matter of policy, weigh that significant distinction so much in all ages
embraced, that he made between his two friends Ephestion and Craterus, when he
said, That the one loved Alexander, and the other loved the King; describing
the principal difference of Princes best servants, that some in affection love
their person, and other in duty love their crown.

Weigh also that excellent taxation of an Error ordinary with Counselors of
Princes, that they counsel their Masters according to the model of their
own mind and fortune, and not of their Masters, when upon Darius great offers
Parmenio had said: Surely, I would accept these offers were I as Alexander:
says Alexander, So would I, were I as Parmenio.

Lastly, weigh that quick and acute reply, which he made when he gave so large
gifts to his friends, and servants, and was asked what he did reserve for
himself, and he answered, Hope: Weigh I say, whether he had not cast up his
account aright, because Hope must be the portion of all that resolve upon
great enterprises. For this was Caesar's portion, when he went first into Gaul,
his estate being then utterly overthrown with Largesses: And this was likewise
the portion of that noble Prince, howsoever transported with ambition, Henry
Duke of Guise, of whom it was usually said: that he was the greatest Usurer in
France, because he had turned all his estate into obligations.

To conclude therefore, as certain Critiques are used to say hyperbolically:
That if all Sciences were lost, they might be found in Virgill: So certainly
this may be said truly; there are the prints, and footesteps of learning in
those few speeches, which are reported of this Prince. The admiration of whom,
when I consider him, not as Alexander the Great, but as Aristotle's Scholar,
has carried me too far.

As for Julius Caesar, the excellency of his learning, needs not to be
argued from his education, or his company, or his speeches: but in a further
degree does declare it self in his writings and works, whereofsome are
extant, and permanent, and some unfortunately perished: For, first we see there
is left unto us that excellent History of his own wars, which he entitled
only a Commentary, wherein all succeeding times have admired the solid weight
of matter, and the real passages, and lively Images of actions, and persons
expressed in the greatest propriety of words, and perspicuitie of Narration
that ever was: which that it was not the effect of a natural gift, but of
learning and precept, is well witnessed by that work of his, entitled De
Analogia, being a grammatical Philosophy, wherein he did labor to make this
same Vox ad placitum, to become Vox ad licitum: and to reduce custom of
speech, to congruitie of speech, and took as it were the pictures of words,
from the life of reason.

So we receive from him as a Monument, both of his power and learning, the
then reformed computation of the year, well expressing, that he took it to be
as great a glory to himself, to observe and know the law of the heavens, as
to give law to men upon the earth.

So likewise in that book of his Anticato, it may easily appear that he did
aspire as well to victory of of wit, as victory of war: undertaking therein
a conflict against the greatest Champion with the pen that then lived, Cicero
the Orator.

So again in his Book of Apothegmes, which he collected, we see that he
esteemed it more honor to make himself, but a pair of Tables, to take the
wise and pithy words of others, than to have every word of his own to be made
an Apothegme, or an Oracle; as vain Princes, by custom of flattery, pretend
to do. And yet if I should enumerate diverse of his speeches; as I did those of
Alexander, they are truly such as Solomon notes, when he says; Verba
sapientum tanquam aculei, and tanquam claui in altum defixi; whereof I will
only recite three, not so delectable for elegancie, but admirable for vigor and
efficacy.

As first, it is reason he be thought a Master of words, that could with one
word appease a mutiny in his Army; which was thus. The Romans when their
Generals did speak to their Army, did use the word Milites; but when the
Magistrates spoke to the people, they did use the word, Quirites: The Soldiers
were in tumult, and seditiously prayed to be cassiered: not that they so
meant, but by expostulation thereof, to draw Caesar to other Conditions;
wherein he being resolute, not to give way, after some silence, he began
his speech, Ego Quirites, which did admit them already cassiered; wherewith
they were so surprised, crossed, and confused, as they would not suffer him to
go on in his speech, but relinquished their demands, and made it their suit,
to be again called by the name of Milites.

The second speech was thus: Caesar did extremely affect the name of King; and
some were set on as he passed by, in popular acclamation to salute him king;
whereupon finding the cry weak and poor; he put it off thus, in a kind of
Jest, as if they had mistaken his surname; Non Rex sum, sed Caesar, a speech,
that if it be searched, the life and fullness of it, can scarce be expressed:
For first it was a resusall of the name, but yet not serious: again it did
signify an infinite confidence and magnanimity, as if he presumed Caesar was
the greater title; as by his worthiness, it is come to pass till this day:
but chiefly, it was a speech of great allurement toward his own purpose: as
if the State did strive with him, but for a name; whereof mean families were
vested: for Rex was a surname with the Romans, as well as King is with us.

The last speech, which I will mention, was used to Metellus: when Caesar,
after war declared, did possess himself of the City of Rome, at which time
entering into the inner treasury, to take the the monney there accumulate,
Metellus being Tribune forbad him: whereto Caesar said, That if he did not
desist, he would lay him dead in the place: And presently taking himself up,
he added: Young man it is harder for me to speak it, than to do it;
Adolescens, durius est mihi, hoc dicere, quam facere. A speech compounded of
the greatest terror, and greatest clemency, that could proceed out of the
mouth of man.

But to return and conclude with him, it is evident himself knew well his
own perfection in learning, and took it upon him; as appeared, when upon
occasion, that some spoke, what a strange resolution it was in Lucius Sylla, to
resign his Dictature; he scoffing at him, to his own advantage, answered;
That Sylla could not skill of Letters, and therefore knew not how to Dictate.

And here it were fit to leave this point, touching the concurrence of
m^litarie virtue and learning; (for what example should come with any grace,
after those two, of Alexander and Caesar) were it not in regard of the
rareness of circumstance, that I find in one other particular; as that which
did so suddenly pass, from extreme scorn, to extreme wonder: and it is of
Xenophon the Philosopher, who went from Socrates School into Asia, in the
expedition of Cyrus the younger, against King Artax^xes: This Xenop^on at that
time, was very young, and never had seen the Wars before: neither had any
command in the Army, but only followed the War, as a voluntary, for the
love and conversation of Proxenus his friend: he was present when Falinus came
in Message from the great King, to the Grecians; after that Cyrus was slain in
the field; and they a handful of men left to themselves in the midst of the
Kings Territories, cut off from their Country by many nauigable Rivers, and
many hundred miles: The Message imported, that they should deliver up their
Arms, and submit themselves to the Kings mercy: To which Message before
answer was made, diverse of the Army co^ferred familiarly with Falinus; and
amongst the rest Xenophon happened to say: Why Falinus, we have now but these
two things left; our Arms, and our Virtue: and if we yield up our Arms, how
shall we make use of our Virtue? Whereto Falinus smiling on him, said; If I be
not deceived, young Gentleman, you are an Athenian; and I believe, you study
Philosophy, and it is pretty that you say; but you are much abused, if you
think your virtue can withstand the Kings power: Here was the scorn; the
wonder followed; which was, that this young Scholar, or Philosopher, after all
the Captains were murdered in parlye by treason, conducted those ten Thousand
foot, through the heart of all the Kings high Countries from Babylon to
Grecia in safety, in despite of all the Kings forces, to the astonishment of
the world, and the encouragement of the Grecians in times succeeding to make
invasion upon the Kings of Persia; as was after purposed by Jason the
Thessalian; attempted by Agesi^aus the Spartan, and achieved by Alexander the
Macedonian; all, upon the ground of the Act of that young Scholar.

To proceed now from imperial and military virtue, to moral and private
virtue; first, it is an assured truth, which is contained in the verses;

Scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter arts,
Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.
It takes away the wildness and barbarism and fierceness of men's minds: but
indeed the accent had need be upon, fideliter. For a little superficial
learning does rather work a contrary effect. It takes away all leuitie,
temeritie, and insolency, by copious suggestion of all doubts and
difficulties, and acquainting the mind to balance reasons on both sides, and
to turn back the first offers and conceits of the mind, and to accept of
nothing but examined and tried. It takes away vain admiration of any thing,
which is the root of all weakness. For all things are admired, either
because they are new, or because they are great. For nouelty, no man that
wadeth in learning or contemplation thoroughly, but will find that printed in
his heart, Nil noui super terram: Neither can any man marvel at the play of
Puppets, that goes behind the curtain, and advises well of the Motion. And
for magnitude, as Alexander the Great, after that he was used to great Armies,
and the great Conquests of the spacious Provinces in Asia, when he received
Letters out of Greece, of some fights and services there, which were commonly
for a passage, or a Fort, or some walled Town at the most, he said; It seemed
to him, that he was advertised of the battles of the Frogs, and the Mise,
that the old tales went of. So cettainely, if a man meditate much upon the
universal frame of nature, the earth with men upon it (the diuinesse of
souls except) will not seem much other, than an Ant-hill, whereas some Ants
carry corn, and some carry their young: and some go empty, and all too and
fro, a little heap of dust. It takes away, or mitigateth fear of death, or
adverse fortune: which is one of the greatest impediments of virtue, and
imperfections of manners. For if a man's mind, be deeply seasoned with the
consideration of the mortality and corruptible nature of things, he will
easily concur with Epictetus, who went forth one day, and saw a woman
weeping for her Pitcher of earth, that was broken; and went forth the next
day, and saw a woman weepinge for her Son that was dead, and thereuppon
said: Heri, vidi fragilem frangi, hodie vidi mortalem mori. And therefore
Virgill did excellently, and profoundlye couple the knowledge of causes, and
the Conquest of all fears, together, as Concomitantia.

Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,
Quique metus omnes, and inexorabile fatum
Subiecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis auari.
It were too long to go over the particular remedies, which learning does
minister, to all the diseases of the mind, sometimes purging the ill humors,
sometimes opening the obstructions, sometimes helping digestion, sometimes
increasing appetite, sometimes healing the wounds and exulcerations thereof, and
the like; and therefore I will conclude with that which has rationem totius;
which is, that it disposes the constitution of the mind, not to be fixed or
settled in the defects thereof; but still to be capable, and susceptible of
growth and reformation. For the unlearned man knows not, what it is to descend
into himself, or to call himself to account, nor the pleasure of that
Suauissima vita, indies sentire se fieri meliorem: The good parts he has, he
will learn to show to the full, and use them dexterously, but not much to
increase them: The faults he has, he will learn how to hide and color them,
but not much to amend them; like an ill Mower, that mowes on still, and never
whets his Sith: whereas, with the learned man, it fares otherwise, that he does
ever intermix the correction and amendment of his mind, with the use and
employment thereof: Nay further in general and in sum: certain it is, that
Veritas, and Bonitas differ, but as the Seal and the Print: for Truth prints
Goodness, and they be the clouds of Error, which descend in the storms of
passions and perturbations.

From moral virtue, let us pass on to matter of power and commandment, and
consider whether in right reason, there be any comparable with that, wherewith
knowledge inuesteth and crowns man's nature. We see the dignity of the
commandment, is according to the dignity of the commanded: to have
commandment over beasts, as Heard-men have, is a thing contemptible: to have
commandment over children, as Schoolmasters have, is a matter of small
honor: to have commandment over Gally-slaues, is a disparagement, rather than
an honor. Neither is the commandment of Tyrants, much better over people,
which have put off the Generositie of their minds: And therefore it was ever
holden, that honors in free Monarchies and Commonwealths, had a sweetness
more, than in Tyrannies, because the commandment extends more over the wills
of men, and not only over their deeds and services. And therefore when Virgill
puts himself forth to attribute to Augustus Caesar the best of humane
honors, he does it in these words:

Victorque volentes
Per populos, dat iura, viamque affectat Olympo:
But yet the commandment of knowledge, is yet higher, than the commandment
over the will: for it is a commandment over the reason, belief, and
understanding of man, which is the highest part of the mind, and gives law to
the will it self. For there is no power on earth, which sets up a throne or
chair of Estate in the spirits, and souls of men, and in their cogitations,
imaginations, opinions, and beleefes: but knowledge and learning. And therefore
we see the detestable and extreme pleasure, that Arch-heretiques, and false
Prophets, and Impostors are transported with, when they once find in
themselves, that they have a superiority in the faith and conscience of men;
so great, as if they have once tasted of it, it is seldom seen, that any
torture or persecution can make them relinquish or abandone it. But as this is
that which the Author of the Revelation, calls the depth or profoundnesse of
Satan: so by argument of contraries, the just and lawful soueraignetie over
men's understanding, by face of truth rightly interpreted, is that which
approaches nearest to the similitude of the divine rule.

As for fortune and advancement, the beneficence of learning, is not so
co^fined to give fortune only to states and Commonwealths: as it does not
likewise give fortune to particular persons. For it was well noted long ago,
that Homer has given more men their livings, than either Sylla, or Caesar, or
Augustus ever did, notwithstanding their great largesses, and donatiues, and
distributions of Lands to so many legions. And no doubt, it is hard to say,
whether arms or learning have advanced greater numbers. And in case of
sovereignty, we see, that if arms or descent have carried away the Kingdom:
yet learning has carried the Priesthood, which ever has been in some
competicion with Empire.

Again, for the pleasure and delight of knowledge and learning, it far
surpasses all other in nature: for shall the pleasures of the affections so
exceed the senses, as much as the obtaining of desire or victory, exceeds a
song, or a dinner? and must not of consequence, the pleasures of the intellect
or understanding exceed the pleasures of the affections? we see in all other
pleasures, there is sacietie; and after they be used, their verdour deparreth;
which shows well, they be but deceits of pleasure, and not pleasures; and
that it was the novelty which pleased, and not the quality. And therefore we
see, that voluptuous men turn Friars; and ambitious Princes turn melancholy.
But of knowledge there is no sacietie, but satisfaction and appetite, are
perpetually interchangeable; and therefore appears to be good in it self
simply, without fallacy or accident. Neither is that pleasure of small
efficacy, and contentment to the mind of man, which the Poet Lucretius
describes elegantly,

Suaue marimagno, turbantibus aequora ventis: etc.

It is a view of delight (says he) to stand or walk upon the shore side,
and to see a Ship tossed with tempest upon the sea; or to be in a fortified
Tower, and to see two Battles join upon a plain. But it is a pleasure
incomparable for the mind of man to be settled, landed, and fortified in the
certainty of truth; and fromth once to descrie and behold the errors,
perturbations, labors, and wanderings up and down of other men.

Lastly, leaving the vulgar arguments, that by learning, man excels man in
that, wherein man excels beasts; that by learning man ascends to the
heavens and their motions; where in body he cannot come; and the like; let us
conclude with the dignity, and excellency of knowledge and learning, in that
whereunto man's nature does most aspire; which is immortality or continuance;
for to this tends generation, and raising of houses and families; to this
buildings, foundations, and monuments, to this tends the desire of memory,
fame, and celebration; and in effect, the strength of all other humane desires;
we see then how far the monuments of wit and learning, are more durable,
than the monuments of power, or of the hands. For have not the verses of Homer
continued 25. hundred years, or more, without the loss of a syllable, or
letter: during which time, infinite Palaces, Temples, Castles, Cities have
been decayed, and demolished? It is not possible to have the true pictures or
statuaes of Cyrus, Alexander, Caesar, no nor of the Kings, or great personages
of much later years; for the originals cannot last; and the copies cannot but
leese of the life and truth. But the Images of men's wits and knowledges remain
in Books, exempted from the wrong of time, and capable of perpetual
renouation: Neither are they fitly to be called Images, because they generate
still, and cast their seeds in the minds of others, provoking and causing
infinite actions and opinions, in succeeding ages. So that if the invention of
the Ship was thought so noble, which carries riches, and commodities from
place to place, and consociateth the most remote regions in participation of
their fruits: how much more are letters to be magnified, which as Ships,
pass through the vast Seas of time, and make ages so distant, to participate
of the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions the one of the other? Nay
further we see, some of the Philosophers which were least divine, and most
immersed in the senses, and denied generally the immortality of the soul; yet
came to this point, that whatsoever motions the spirit of man could act, and
perform without the Organs of the body, they thought might remain after
death; which were only those of the understanding, and not of the affection; so
immortal and incorruptible a thing did knowledge seem unto them to be. But we
that know by divine revelation, that not only the understanding, but the
affections purified, not only the spirit, but the body changed shall be
advanced to immortality, do disclaim in these rudiments of the senses. But
it must be remembered, both in this last point, and so it may likewise be
needful in other places, that in probation of the dignity of knowledge, or
learning I did in the beginning separate divine testimony, from humane; which
method, I have pursued, and so handled them both apart.

Nevertheless, I do not pretend, and I know it will be impossible for me by
any Pleading of mine, to reuerse the judgment, either of Aesops Cock, that
preferred the Barly-corne, before the Gemme; or of Mydas, that being chosen
Judge, between Apollo President of the Muses, and Pan God of the Flocks,
judged for Plenty: or of Paris, that judged for Beauty, and soue against
Wisdom and Power: nor of Agrippina, Occidat matrem, modo imperet: that
preferred Empire with condition never so detestable; or of Ulysses, Qui vetulam
proetulit immortalitati, being a figure of those which prefer Custom and
Habit before all excellency; or of a number of the like popular Judgments.
For these things continue, as they have been: but so will that also continue,
whereupon learning has ever relied, and which fails not: Iustificata est
sapientia a filijs suis.

THE SECOND Book of FRANCIS BACON; of the proficience or advancement of
Learning, Divine and Humane. To the King.
IT might seem to have more conuenience, though it come often otherwise to
pass, (Excellent King) that those which are fruitful in their generations,
and have in themselves the fore sight of Immortality, in their descendents,
should likewise be more careful of the good estate of future times; unto which
they know they must transmitte and commend over their dearest pledges. Queen
Elizabeth was a soiourner in the world in respect of her unmarried life: and was
a blessing to her own times; and yet so as the impression of her good
government, besides her happy memory, is not without some effect, which does
survive her. But to your Majesty, whom God has already blessed with so much
Royal issue, worthy to continue and represent you for ever: and whose
youthful and fruitful bed does yet promise many the like renouations: It
is proper and agreeable to be conversant, not only in the transitory parts of
good government: but in those acts also, which are in their nature permanent
and perpetual. Amongst the which (if affection do not transport me,) there is
not any more worthy, then the further endowement of the world with sound and
fruitful knowledge: For why should a few received Authors stand up like
Hercules Columns, beyond which, there should be no sailing, or discovering,
since we have so bright and benign a star, as your Ma: to conduct and
prosper us? To return therefore where we left, it remains to consider of
what kind those Acts are which have been undertaken, and performed by Kings and
others, for the increase and advancement of learning, wherein I purpose to
speak actiuely without digressing or dylating.

Let this ground therefore be laid, that all works are ouerco^men by amplitude
of reward, by soundness of direction, and by the conjunction of labors. The
first multiplyeth endeavor, the second preuenteth error, and the third
supplieth the frailty of man. But the principal of these is direction: For
Claudus in via, antevertit cursorem extra viam: And Solomon excellently sets
it down; If the Iron be not sharp, it requires more strength: But wisdom
is that which prevails: signifying that the Invention or election of the
Mean, is more effectual then any inforcement or accumulation of endeavors.
This I am induced to speak; for that (not derogating from the noble intention
of any that have been deseruers toward the State of learning) I do observe
nevertheless, that their works and Acts are rather matters of Magnificence
and Memory, then of progression and proficience, and tend rather to augment
the mass of Learning in the multitude of learned men, then to rectify or
raise the Sciences themselves.

The Works or Acts of merit toward learning are conversant about three
objects, the Places of learning; the Books of learning; and the Persons of the
learned. For as water, whether it be the dew of heaven, or the springs of the
earth, does scatter and leese it self in the ground, except it be collected
into some Receptacle, where it may by union, comfort and sustain it self: And
for that cause the Industry of Man has made and framed Spring heads, Conduits,
Cesternes, and Pooles, which men have accustomed likewise to beautify and
adorn with accomplishments of Magnificence and State, as well as of use and
necessity: So this excellent liquor of knowledge, whether it descend from
divine inspiration, or spring from humane sense, would soon perish and
vanishe to oblyuion, if it were not preserved in Books, Traditions,
Conferences, and Places appointed, as Universities, Colleges, and Schools,
for the receipt and comforting of the same.

The works which concern the Seats and Places of learning, are four;
Foundations, and Buyldings, Endowments with Revenues, Endowme^ts with
Franchizes and Privileges, Institutions and Ordinances for government, all
tending to quietness and priuatenesse of life, and discharge of cares and
troubles, much like the Stations, which Virgil prescribes for the hyuing of
Bees.

Principio seeds Apibus, statioque petenda:
Quo neque sit ventis aditus, etc.
The works touching Books are two: First Libraries, which are as the Shrynes,
where all the Relics of the ancient Saints, full of true virtue, and that
without delusion or imposture, are preserved, and reposed; Secondly, New
Editions of Authors, with more correct impressions, more faithful
translations, more profitable glosses, more diligent annotations, and the like.

The works pertaining to the persons of learned men (besides the advancement
and countenancing of them in general) are two: The reward and designation of
Readers in Sciences already extant and invented: and the reward and designation
of Writers and Enquirers, concerning any parts of Learning, not sufficiently
labored and prosecuted.

These are summarilie the works and acts, wherein the merits of many
excellent Princes, and other worthy Personages have been conversant. As for
any particular commemorations, I call to mind what Cicero said, when he gave
general thanks. Di^ffcile non aliquem; ingratum quenquam praeterire: Let us
rather according to the Scriptures, look unto that part of the Race, which is
before us; then look back to that which is already attained.

First therefore amongst so many great Foundations of Colleges in Europe, I
find strange that they are all dedicated to Professions, and none left free to
Arts and Sciences at large. For if men judge that learning should be referred
to action, they judge well: but in this they fall into the Error described in
the ancient Fable; in which the other parts of the body did suppose the
stomache had been idle, because it neither performed the office of Motion, as
the lymmes do, nor of Sense, as the head does: But yet notwithstanding it is
the Stomache that digesteth and distributeth to all the rest: So if any man
think Philosophy and Universality to be idle Studies; he does not consider
that all Professions are from thence served, and supplied. And this I take to
be a great cause that has hindered the progression of learning, because these
Fundamental knowledges have been studied but in passage. For if you will have a
tree bear more fruit then it has used to do; it is not any thing you can do
to the boughs, but it is the styrring of the earth, and putting new moulde
about the roots, that must work it. Neither is it to be forgotten, that this
dedicating of Foundations and Dotations to professory Learning, has not only
had a Malign aspect, and influence upon the growth of Scyences, but has also
been prejudicial to States and governments. For hence it proceeds that
Princes find a solitude, in regard of able men to serve them in causes of
estate, because there is no education collegiate, which is free; where such as
were so disposed, might give themselves to Histories, modern languages,
books of policy and civil discourse, and other the like inablements unto
service of estate.

And because founders of Colleges do plant, and founders of Lectures do
water: it follows well in order to speak of the defect, which is in Public
Lectures: Namely, in the smalnesse and meanness of the salary or reward which
in most places is assigned unto them: whether they be Lectures of Arts, or of
Professions. For it is necessary to the progression of Scyences, that Readers
be of the most able and sufficient men; as those which are ordained for
generating, and propagating of Scyences, and not for transitory use. This
cannot be, except their condition, and endowme^t be such, as may content the
ablest man, to appropriate his whole labor, and continue his whole age in that
function and attendance, and therefore must have a proportion answerable to
that mediocritic or competencie of advancement, which may be expected from a
Profession, or the Practice of a Profession: So as, if you will have Scyences
flourish, you must observe David's military law, which was, That those which
slaied with the Carriage, should have equal part with those which were in the
Action: else will the carriages be ill attended: So Readers in Scyences are
indeed the Gardyans of the stores and provisions of Scyences, whence men in
active courses are furnished, and therefore ought to have equal entertainment
with them; otherwise if the fathers in Scyences be of the weakest sort, or be
ill maintained.

Et Patrum invalidi referent ieiunia nati.

Another defect I note, wherein I shall need some Alchimist to help me, who
call upon men to sell their Books, and to build Fornaces, quitting and
forsaking Minerva, and the Muses, as barreyne virgins, and relying upon
Vulcan. But certain it is, that unto the deep, fruitful, and operative
study of many Scyences, specially Natural Philosophy and Physic, Books be
not only the Instrumentals; wherein also the beneficence of men has not been
altogether wanting: for we see, Spheres, Globes, Astrolabes, Mappes, and the
like, have been provided, as appurtenances to Astronomy and Cosmography, as
well as books: We see likewise, that some places instituted for Physic, have
annexed the commodity of Gardens for Simples of all sorts, and do likewise
command the use of dead Bodies for Anatomyes. But these do respect but a few
things. In general, there will hardly be any Main proficience in the
disclosing of nature, except there be some allowance for expenses about
experime^ts; whether they be experiments appertaining to Vulcanus or Dedalus,
Furnace or Engyne, or any other kind; And therefore as Secretaries, and Spyalls
of Princes and States bring in Bills for Intelligence; so you must allow the
Spyalls and Intelligencers of Nature, to bring in their Bills, or else you
shall be ill advertised.

And if Alexander made such a liberal assignation to Aristotle of treasure for
the allowance of Hunters, Fowlers, Fishers and the like, that he might compile
an History of Nature, much better dothey deserve it that travails in Arts of
nature.

Another defect which I note, is an intermission or neglect in those which are
Governors in Universities, of Consultation, and in Princes or superior
persons, of Visitation: To enter into account and consideration, whether the
Readings, exercises, and other customs appertayning unto learning, aunciently
begun, and since continued, be well instituted or no, and thereupon to ground
an amendment, or reformation in that which shall be found inconvenient. For it
is one of your Majesty's own most wise and Princely Maxims, that in all
vsages, and Presidents, the Times be considered wherein they first began,
which if they were weak, or ignorant, it derogateth from the Authority of the
Usage, and leaves it for suspect. And therefore in as much, as most of the
vsages, and orders of the Universities were derived from more obscure times, it
is the more requisite, they be reexamined. In this kind I will give an instance
or two for example sake, of things that are the most obvious and familiar: The
one is a matter, which though it be ancient and general, yet I hold to be an
error, which is, that Scholars in Universities come too soon, and too unripe
to Logic and Rhetoric; Arts fitter for Graduates then children, and
Nouices: For these two rightly taken, are the grauest of Sciences, being the
Arts of Arts, the one for Judgment, the other for Ornament: And they be the
Rules and Directions, how to set forth and dispose matter: and therefore for
minds empty and vnfraught with matter, and which have not gathered that which
Cicero calls Sylua and Supellex, stuff and variety to begin with those
Arts (as if one should learn to weigh, or to measure, or to painte the Wind)
does work but this effect: that the wisdom of those Arts, which is great,
and universal, is almost made contemptible, and is degenerate into childish
Sophystrie, and ridiculous affectation. And further, the untimely learning of
them has drawn on by consequence, the superficial and unprofitable teaching
and writing of them, as fitteth indeed to the capacity of children: Another, is
a lack I find in the exercises used in the Universities, which do make to
great a divorce between Invention and Memory: for their speeches are either
premeditate in Verbis conceptis, where nothing is left to Invention, or merely
Extemporall, where little is left to Memory: whereas in life and action, there
is least use of either of these, but rather of intermixtures of premeditation,
and Invention: Notes and Memory. So as the exercise fitteth not the practice,
nor the Image, the life; and it is ever a true rule in exercises, that they be
framed as nere as may be to the life of practice, for otherwise they do pervert
the Motions, and faculties of the Mind, and not prepare them. The truth
whereof is not obscure, when Scholars come to the practices of professions, or
other actions of civil life, which when they set into, this want is soon
found by themselves, and sooner by others. But this part touching the amendment
of the Institutions and orders of Universities. I will conclude with the clause
of Caesar's letter to Oppins and Balbus, Hoc quemaamodum fieri possit, nonnulla
mihi in me^tem veniunt, and multa reperiri possunt: de ijs rebus rogovos, vt
cogitationem suscipiatis.

Another defect which I note, ascends a little higher then the precedent. For
as the proficience of learning consists much in the orders and institutions
of Universities, in the same States and kingdoms: So it would be yet more
advanced, if there were more Intelligence Mutual between the Universities of
Europe, then now there is. We see, there be many Orders and Foundatio^s, which
though they be divided under several soueraignties, and territories, yet they
take themselves to have a kind of contract, fraternity, and correspondence,
one with the other, insomuch as they have Prouincials and Generals. And surely
as Nature creates Brotherhood in Families, and Arts Mechanical contract
Brotherhoods in communalties, and the Anoyntment of God superinduceth a
Brotherhood in Kings and Bishops: So in like manner there cannot but be a
fraternity in learning and illumination, relating to that Paternitie, which is
attributed to God, who is called the Father of illuminations or lights.

The last defect which I will note, is, that there has not been, or very rarely
been, any Public Designation of Writers or Enquirers, concerning such parts
of knowledge, as may appear not to have bin already sufficiently labored or
undertaken, unto which point it is an Induceme^t; to enter into a view and
examination, what parts of learning have bin prosecuted, and what omitted; For
the opinion of plenty is amongst the causes of want; and the great quantity
of Books makes a show rather of superfluity then lack, which surcharge
nevertheless is not to be remedied by making no more books, but by making
more good books, which as the Serpent of Moses, might devour the Serpe^ts of
the Incha^tors.

The removing of all the defects formerly enumerate, except the last, and of
the active part also of the last (which is the designation of Writers) are
Opera Basilica; toward which the endeavors of a private man may be, but as an
Image in a cross way; that may point at the way, but cannot go it. But the
inducing part of the latter (which is the suruay of Learning), may be set
forward by private travail; Wherefore I will now attempt to make a general
and faithful perambulation of learning, with an inquiry what parts theroflye
fresh and wast, and not improued and converted by the Industry of man; to the
end that such a plotte made and recorded to memory, may both minister light to
anic public designation: and also serve to excite voluntary endeavors; wherein
nevertheless my purpose is at this time, to note only omissions and
deficiences; and not to make any redargution of Errors, or incomplete
prosecutions: For it is one thing to set forth what ground lies unmanured; and
another thing to correct ill husbandry in that which is manured.

In the handling and undertaking of which work, I am not ignorant, what it is,
that I do now move and attempt, nor insensible of mine own weakness, to
sustain my purpose: But my hope is, that if my extreme love to learning
carry me too far, I may obtain the excuse of affection; for that It is not
granted to man to love, and to be wise. But I know well I can use no other
liberty of Judgment, then I must leave to others, and I for my part shall be
indifferently glad either to perform my self, or accept from another, that
duty of humanity: Nam quierranti comiter monstrat viam: etc. I do foresee
likewise, that of those things, which I shall enter and Register, as
Deficiences and Omissions: Many will conceive and censure, that some of them
are already done and extant: others to be but curiosities, and things of no
great use: and others to be of too great difficulty, and almost
impossibility to be compassed and effected: But for the two first, I refer
my self to the particulars. For the last, touching impossibility, I take it,
those things are to be held possible, which may be done by some person, though
not by every one: and which may be done by many, though not by any one: and
which may be done in succession of ages, though not within the houre-glasse of
one man's life: and which may be done by public designation, though not by
private endeavor. But notwithstanding, if any Man will take to himself rather
that of Solomon, Dicit p^ger, Leo est in via, then that of Virgil, Possunt,
quia posse videntur: I shall be content that my labors be esteemed, but as
the better sort of wishes: for as it asks some knowledge to demand a
question, not impertinent; so it requires some sense, to make a wish not
absurd.

THE PARTS of humane learning have reference to the three parts of Man's
understanding, which is the seat of Learning. HISTORY to his MEMORY, POESY to
his IMAGINATION, and PHILOSOPHY to his REASON: Divine learning receives the
same distribution, for the Spirit of Man is the same: though the Revelation of
Oracle and Sense be diverse: So as Theology consists also of HISTORY of the
Church; of PARABLES, which is Divine Poesy: and of holy DOCTRINE or Precept.
For as for that part, which seems supernumerarie, which is Prophecy: it is
but Divine History: which has that prerogative over humane, as the Narration
may be before the fact, as well as after.

HISTORY is NATV^L, CIVIL^, ECCLESIASTICAL and LITERARY, whereof the three
first I allow as extant, the fourth I note as deficient. Historia Literaru^.
For no man has propounded to himself the general state of ^arning to be
described and represented from age to age, as many have done the works of
Nature, and the State civil and Ecclesiastical; without which the History of
the world seems to me, to be as the Statua of Polyphemus with his eye out,
that part being wanting, which does most show the spirit, and life of the
person: And yet I am not ignorant that in diverse particular sciences, as of the
Iurisconsults, the Mathematicians, the Rhetoricians the Philosophers, there are
set down some small memorials of the Schools, Authors, and Books: and so like
wise some barren relations touching the Invention of Arts, or vsages. But a
just story of learning, containing the Antiquities and Originalls of
Knowledges, and their Sects; their Inventions, their Traditions; their diverse
Administrations, and Managings; their Flourishings, their Oppositions, Decays,
Depressions, Obliuions, Remoues; with the causes, and occasions of them, and
all other events concerning learning, throughout the ages of the world; I may
truly affirm to be wanting. The use and end of which work, I do not so much
design for curiosity, or satisfaction of those that are the lovers of
learning, but chiefly for a more serious, and grave purpose, which is this in
few words, that it will make learned men wise, in the use and administration
of learning. For it is not Saint Augustines nor Saint Ambrose works that will
make so wise a Divine; as Ecclesiastical History, thoroughly read and
observed: and the same reason is of Learning.

HISTORY of NATVRE is of three sorts: of NATVRE in COURSE; of NATVRE ER^ING, or
VARYING; and of NATVRE ALTERED or wroght, that is HISTORY of CREATVRES, HISTORY
of MARVAILES, and HISTORY of ARTS. The first of these, no doubt is extant, and
that in good perfection. The two later are handled so weakly and unprofitably,
as I am moved to note them as deficient. For I find no sufficient, or competent
Collection of the Works Historia Naturae Errantis.
of Nature, which have a Digression, and Deflexion, from the ordinary course of
Generations, Productions, and Motions, whether they be singularities of place
and region, or the strange events of time and chance, or the effects of yet
unknown proprieties, or the instances of exception to general kinds: It is
true, I find a number of books of fabulous Experiments, and Secrets, and
frivolous Impostures for pleasure and strangeness. But a substantial and
severe Collection of the HETE^, or IRREGVLARS of NATVRE, well examined and
described I find not specially not with due reiection of fables, and popular
Errors: For, as things now are, if an untruth in Nature be once on foot, what
by reason of the neglect of examination, and countenance of Antiquity, and
what by reason of the use of the opinion in similitudes, and ornaments of
speech, it is never called down.

The use of this work, honored with a president in Aristotle, is nothing
less, then to give contentment to the appetite of Curious and vain wits, as
the manner of MIRABILARIES is to do: But for two Reasons, both of great
weight: The one to correct the parcialitie of Axioms, and Opinions: which are
commonly framed only upon common and familiar examples: The other, because
from the Wonders of Nature, is the nearest Intelligence and passage toward
the Wonders of Art: For it is no more, but by following, and as it were,
hounding Nature in her wanderings, to be able to lead her afterward to the
same place again. Neither am I of opinion in this HISTORY of MARVAILES, that
superstitious Narrations of Sorceries, Witchecraftes, Dreams, Diuinations, and
the like, where there is an assurance, and clear evidence of the fact, be
altogether excluded. For it is not yet known in what cases, and how far,
effects attributed to superstition, do participate of Natural causes: and
therefore how-soeuer the practice of such things is to be condemned, yet from
the Speculation and sideration of them, light may be taken, not only for the
discerning of the offenses, but for the further disclosing of Nature: Neither
ought a Man to make scruple of entering into these things for inquisition of
truth, as your Majesty has showed in your own example: who with the two
clear eyes of Religion and natural Philosophy, have looked deeply and wisely
into these shadows, and yet proved your self to be of the Nature of the
Sun, which passes through pollutions, and it self remains as pure as
before. But this I hold fit, that these Narrations, which have mixture with
superstition, be sorted by themselves, and not to be mingled with the
Narrations, which are merely and sincerely natural. But as for the Narrations
touching the Prodigies and Miracles of Religions, they are either not true, or
not Natural; and therefore impertinent for the Story of Nature.

For HISTORY of NATVRE Historia Mechanica.
WROVGHT, or MECHANICAL, I find some Collections Made of Agriculture, and
likewise of Manual Arts, but commonly with a reiection of experiments familiar
and vulgar. For it is esteemed a kind of dishonor unto Learning, to descend
to inquiry or Meditation upon Matters Mechanical; except they be such as
may be thought secrets, rarities, and special subtilties: which humor of
vain, and supercilious Arrogancy, is justly derided in Plato: where he
brings in Hippias a vanting Sophist, disputing with Socrates a true and
unfeigned inquisitor of truth; where the subject being touching beauty,
Socrates, after his wandering manner of Inductions, put first an example of a
fair Virgin, and then of a fair Horse, and then of a fair pot well glazed,
whereat Hippias was offended, and said; More then for courtesies sake, he did
think much to dispute with any, that did allege such base and Sordide
instances, whereunto Socrates answers; you have reason, and it becomes you
well, being a man so trim in your ves^ments, etc. and so goes on in an
Ironie. But the truth is, they be not the highest instances, that give the
securest information; as may be well expressed in the tale so common of the
Philosopher, that while he gazed vpwardes to the Stars, fell into the water:
for if he had looked down he might have seen the Stars in the water, but
looking aloft he could not see the water in the Stars: So it comes often
to pass, that mean and small things discover great, better then great can
discover the small: and therefore Aristotle notes well, that the nature of
every thing is best seen in his smallest portions, and for that cause he
enquireth the nature of a Commonwealth, first in a Family, and the Simple
Coniugatio^s of Man and Wife; Parent, and Child, Master and Servant, which are
in every Cottage; Even so likewise the nature of this great City of the world
and the policy thereof, must be first sought in mean concordances, and small
portions: So we see how that secret of Nature, of the turning of Iron, touched
with the Loadestone, toward the North, was found out in needels of Iron, not
in bars of Iron.

But if my judgment be of any weight, the use of HISTORIEMECHANICAL, is of
all others the most radical, and fundamental toward Natural Philosophy,
such Natural Philosophy, as shall not vanish in the fume of subtle, sublime,
or delectable speculation, but such as shall be operative to the endowment,
and benefit of Man's life: for it will not only minister and suggest for the
present, Many ingenious practizes in all trades, by a connection and
transferring of the observations of one Art, to the use of another, when the
experiences of several mysteries shall fall under the consideration of one
man's mind: But surder, it will give a more true, and real illumination
concerning Causes and Axioms, then is hitherto attained. For like as a Man's
disposition is never well known, till he be crossed, nor Proteus ever
changed shapes, till he was straightened and held fast: so the passages and
variations of Nature cannot appear so fully in the liberty of Nature, as in
the trialls and vexations of Art.

FOr CIVIL HISTORY, it is of three kinds, not unfitly to be compared with the
three kinds of Pictures or Images: for of Pictures or Images, we see some are
Unfinished, some are parfite, and some are defaced: So of Histories, we may
find three kinds, MEMORIALLS, PARFITE HISTORIES, and ANTIQVITIES: for
MEMORIALLS are History unfinished, or the first, or rough draughts of
History, and ANTIQVITIES are History defaced, or some remnants of History,
which have casually escaped the shipwreck of time.

MEMORIALLS or PREPARATORY HISTORY are of two sorts, whereof the on may be
termed COMMENTARIES, and the other REGISTERS: COMMENTARIES are they which set
down a continuance of the naked eue^ts and actions, without the motives or
designs, the counsels, the speeches, the pretexts the occasions, and other
passages of action: for this is the true nature of a commentary (though Caesar
in modesty mixed with greatness, did for his pleasure apply the name of a
commentary to the best History of the world) REGISTERS are collectio^s of
Public Acts, as Decrees of counsel, Judicial proceedings, Declarations and
Letters of estate, Orations, and the like, without a perfect continuance, or
contexture of the thread of the Narration.

ANTIQVITIES, or Remnants of History, are, as was said, tanquam Tabula
Naufragij, when industrious persons by an exact and scrupulous diligence and
observation, out of Momuments, Names, Words, Proverbs, Traditions, Private
Records, and Evidences, Fragments of stories, Passages of Books, that
concern not story, and the like, do save and recover somewhat from the
deluge of time.

In these kinds of imperfect Histories I do assign no deficience, for they
are tanquam imperfecte Mista, and therefore any deficience in them is but their
nature. As for the Corruptions and Mothes of History, which are Epitomes, the
use of them deserves to be banished, as all men of sound Judgment have
confessed, as those that have fretted and corroded the sound bodies of many
excellent Histories, and wrought them into base and unprofitable dregs.

HISTORY which may be called JUST and PARFITE History, is of three kinds,
according to the object which it propounds, or pretends to represent: for
it either represe^teth a TIME, or a PERSON, or an ACTION. The first we call
CHRONICLES, The second LIVES, and the third NARRATIONS, or RELATIONS. Of these
although the first be the most complete and absolute kind of History, and
has most estimation and glory: yet the second excels it in profit and use,
and the third in verity and sincerity. For HISTORY of TIMES represents the
magnitude of Actions, and the public faces and deportme^ts of persons, and
passes over in silence the smaller passages and Motions of men and Matters.
But such being the workmanship of God, as he does hang the greatest weight
upon the smallest Wyars, Maxima e Minimis suspe^de^s, it comes therefore to
pass, that such Histories do rather set forth the pomp of business, then the
true and inward resorts thereof. But Lives if they be well written, propounding
to themselves a person to represent, in whom actions both greater and smaller,
public and private have a commixture; must of necessity contain a more
true, native, and lively representation: So again Narrations, and Relations of
actions as the War of Peloponnesus, the Expeditio^ of Cyrus Minor, the
Conspiracy of Catiline, cannot but be more purely and exactly true, then
HISTORIES of TIMES, because they may choose an argument comprehensible within
the notice and instructions of the Writer: whereas he that undertaketh the
story of a time, specially of any length, cannot but meet with many blankes,
and spaces, which he must be forced to fill up, out of his own wit and
conjecture.

For the HISTORY of TIMES. (I mean of civil History,) the providence of God
has made the distribution: for it has pleased God to ordain and illustrate
two exemplar States of the world, for Arms, learning, Moral Virtue, Policy,
and Laws. The STATE of GRECIA, and the STATE of ROME: The Histories whereof
occupying the MIDDLEPART of time, have more ancient to them, Histories which
may by one common name, be termed the ANTIQVITIES of the WORLD; and after
them, Histories which may be likewise called by the name of MODERN HISTORY.

Now to speak of the deficiences: As to the HEATHEN ANTIQVITIES of the world,
it is in vain to note them for deficient: deficient they are no doubt,
consisting most of fables and fragments: but the deficience cannot be helped:
for Antiquity is like fame, Caput inter nubila condit, her head is mu^ed from
our sight: For the HISTORY of the EXEMPLAR STATES, it is extant in good
perfection. Not but I could wish there were a perfect Course of History for
Grecia from Theseus to Philopaemen, (what time the affairs of Grecia drowned
and extinguished in the affairs of Rome) and for Rome, from Romulus to
Iustinianus, who may be truly said to be Vltimus Romanorum. In which sequences
of story the Text of Thucidides and Xenophon in the one, and the Texts of
Liuius, Polybius, Salustius, Caesar, Appianus, Tacitus, Herodianus in the other
to be kept intyre without any diminutio^ at all, and only to be supplied and
continued. But this is Matter of Magnificence, rather to be commended then
required: and we speak now of parts of Learning supplementall, and not of
superetogation.

But for MODERN HISTORIES, whereof there are some few very worthy, but the
greater part beneath Mediocritie, leaving the care of forreyne stories to
forreyne States, because I will not be Curiosus in aliena Republica, I cannot
fail to represent to your Majesty, the unworthiness of the History of
England in the Maine continuance thereof, and the partiality, and obliquitie
of that of Scotland, in the latest and largest Author that I have seen;
supposing that it would be honor for your Majesty, and a work very
memorable, if this Island of great Brittanie, as it is now joined in Monarchy
for the ages to come: So were joined in one History for the times passed,
after the manner of the sacred History, which draws down the story of the
Ten Tribes, and of the Two Tribes, as Twins together. And if it shall seem
that the greatness of this work may make it less exactly performed, there is
an excellent Periode of a much smaller compass of time, as to the story of
England that is to say, from the Uniting of the Roses, to the Uniting of the
Kingdoms: a Portion of time wherein, to my understanding, there has bin the
rarest varieties, that in like number of successio^s of any hereditary
Monarchy has bin known: For it begins with the mixed Adeption of a Crown,
by Arms and Title: An entry by Battle, an Establishment by Marriage: and
therefore times answerable, like waters after a tempest, full of working and
swelling, though without extreamitie of Storm; but well passed through by the
wisdom of the Pylote, being one of the most sufficient kings of all the
number. Then follows the Reign of a King, whose actions howsoever conducted
had much intermixture with the affairs of Europe: balancing and inclyning them
variably, in whose time also began that great alteration in the State
Ecclesiastical, an action which seldom comes upon the Stage: Then the
Reign of a Minor, then an offer of an usurpation, (though it was but as Febris
Ephemera). Then the Reign of a Queen Matched with a Forreyner: Then of a
Queen that lived solitary, and unmarried, and yet her government so masculine,
as it had greater impression, and operation upon the States abroad, then it
any ways received from thence; And now last, this most happy, and glorious
event, that this Island of Brittany divided from all the world, should be
united in it self; And that Oracle of Rest given to Aeneas, Antiquam enquirite
Matrem, should now be performed and fulfilled upon the Nations of England and
Scotland, being now reunited in the ancient Mother name of Brittany, as a full
periode of all instabilitie and peregrinations: So that as it comes to pass
in Massiue bodies, that they have certain trepidations and wauerings before
they fix and settle: So it seems, that by the providence of God, this
Monarchy before it was to settle in your Majesty, and your generations, (in
which I hope it is now established for ever,) it had these prelusiue changes
and varieties.

For LIVES, I do find strange that these times have so little esteemed the
virtues of the times, as that the Writings of lives should be no more frequent.
For although there be not many sovereign Princes or absolute co^manders, and
that States are most collected into Monarchies; yet are there many worthy
personages, that deserve better then dispersed report, or barren Elogies: For
herein the Invention of one of the late Poets is proper, and does well enrich
the ancient fiction; for he faineth, that at the end of the thread or Web of
every man's life, there was a little Medall containing the Persons name, and
that Time waited upon the sheeres, and as soon as the thread was cut, caught
the Medalls, and carried them to the River of Lethe, and about the bank there
were many Birds flying up and down, that would get the Medals and carry them
in their Beke a little while, and then let them fall into the River. Only
there were a few Swannes, which if they got a Name, would carry it to a
Temple, where it was consecrate. And although many men more mortal in their
affections, then in their bodies, do esteem desire of name and memory, but as
a vanity and ventositie;

Animi nil magnaelaudis egentes:
Which opinion comes from that Root, Non prius lauds contempsimus, quam
la^danda facere desivimus: yet that will not alter Salomons judgment, Memoria
Iusti cum laudibus, at impioru^ nome^ putresect: The one flourishes, the other
either co^sumeth to present oblivion, or turns to an ill odor: And therefore
in that style or addition, which is and has bin long well received, and
brought in use, Faeticis memoriae, piae memoriae, bonae memoriae, we do
acknowledge that which Cicero says, borrowing it from Demosthenes, that Bona
Fama propria possessio defunctorum, which possession I cannot but note, that in
our times it lies much wast and that therein there is a Deficience.

For NARRATIONS and RELATIONS of particular actions, there were also to be
wished a greater diligence therein, for there is no great action but has some
good pen which attends it. And because it is an ability not common to Write
a good History, as may well appear by the small number of them: yet if
particularitie of actions memorable, were but tolerably reported as they pass,
the compiling of a complete HISTORY of TIMES might be the better expected,
when a Writer should arise that were fit for its for the collection of such
relations might be as a Nursery gardein, whereby to plant a fair and stately
gardein, when time should serve.

There is yet another portion of History which Cornelius Tacitus makes, which
is not to be forgotten specially with that application, which he accoupleth it
withal, ANNALS, and IOVRNALS, appropriating to the former, Matters of estate,
and to the later, Acts, and Accidents of a meaner Nature. For giving but a
touch of certain Magnificent Buildings, he adds, Cumex dignitate populi
Romani repertum sit, res illustres annalibus, talia diurnis vrbis Actis
mandare. So as there is a kind of contemplative Heraldry, as well as Civil.
And as nothing does derogate from the dignity of a state more then confusion
of degrees: So it does not a little imbase the Authority of an History, to
intermingle matters of triumph, or matters of ceremony, or matters of Novelty,
with matters of State; But the use of a IOVRNALL has not only been in the
History of Time, but like wise in the History of Persons, and chiefly of
actions; for Princes in ancient time had upon point of honor and policy both,
Iournalls kept, what passed day by day: for we see the Chronicle which was red
before Abassuerus, when he could not take rest, contained matter of affairs
indeed, but such as had passed in his own time, and very lately before; But
the IOVRNALL of Alexanders house expressed every small particularitie, even
concerning his Person and Court: and it is yet an use well received in
enterprises memorable, as expeditions of War, Nauigations, and the like, to
keep Dyaries of that which passes continually.

I cannot likewise be ignorant of a form of Writing, which some grave and
wise men have used, containing a scattered History of those actions, which they
have thought worthy of memory, with politic discourse and observation
thereupon; not incorporate into the History, but seperately, and as the more
principal in their intention: Which kind of RVMINATED HISTORY, I think more
fit to place amongst Books of policy, whereof we shall hereafter speak, then
amongst Books of History: for it is the true office of History to represent
the events themselves, together with the counsels, and to leave the
observations, and conclusions thereupon, to the liberty and faculty of every
man's judgment: But Mixtures, are things irregular, whereof no man can define.

So also is there another kind of History manifoldly mixed, and that is HISTORY
of COSMOGRAPHY, being compounded of Natural History in respect of the Regions
themselves, of History civil, in respect of the Habitations, Regiments, and
Manners of the people; and the Mathematiques in respect of the Climats, and
configurations toward the Heavens, which part of learning of all others in
this latter time has obtained most Proficience. For it may be truly affirmed
to the honor of these times, and in a virtuous emulation with Antiquity, that
this great Building of the world, had never through lights made in it, till the
age of us and our fathers: For although they had knowledge of the Antipodes:

Nosque vbi primus equis Oriens afflauit anhelis:
Illic sera rubens acce^dit lumina vesper, yet that might be by demonstration,
and not in fact, and if by travail, it requires the voyage but of half the
Globe. But to circle the Earth, as the heavenly Bodies do, was not done, nor
enterprised, till these later times: And therefore these times may justly bear
in their word, not only Plus vltra in precedence of the ancient Non vltra, and
Imitabile fulmen, in precedence of the ancient: Non imitabile fulmen,

Demens qui nymbos et non imitabile fulmen, etc. But likewise, -- Imitabile
Caelum: in respect of the many memorable voyages after the manner of heaven,
about the globe of the earth.

And this Proficience in Navigations, and discoueries, may plant also an
expectation of the ^urder proficience, and augmentation of all Scyences,
because it may seem they are ordained by God to be Coevalls, that is, to meet
in one Age. For so the Prophet Daniel speaking of the latter times foretells:
Plurimi pertransibunt, and Multiplex erit Scientia, as if the opennesse and
through passage of the world, and the increase of knowledge were appointed to
be in the same ages, as we see it is already performed in great part, the
learning of these later times not much giving place to the former two Periods
or Returns of learning, the one of the Graecians, the other of the Romans.

HISTORY ECCLSIASTICAL, receives the same divisions with History civil; but
further in the propriety thereof may be divided into HISTORY of the CHVRCH, by
a general name. HISTORY of PROPHECY, and HISTORY of PROVIDENCE: The first
describes the times of the militant Church; whether it be fluctua^t, as the
Arc of Noah, or moveable, as the Arc in the Wilderness, or at rest, as the
Arc in the Temple; That is, the state of the Church in Persecution, in Remove,
and in Peace. This part I ought in no sort to note as deficient, only I would
the virtue and sincerity of it, were according to the Mass, and quantity.
But I am not now in hand with censures, but with omissions.

The second, which is HISTORY of PROPHECY, consists of two Relatiues, the
Prophecy, and the accomplishment: and therefore the nature of such a work
ought to be, that every prophecy of the Scripture be sorted with the event
fulfilling the same, throughout the ages of the world, both for the better
confirmation of faith, and for the better illumination of the Church, touching
those parts of Prophecies, which are yet unfulfilled: allowing nevertheless
that Latitude, which is agreeable, and familiar unto divine Prophecies, being of
the nature of their Author, with whom a thousand years are but as one day,
and therefore are not fulfilled punctually, at once, but have springing and
germinant accomplishment throughout many ages, though the height or fullness of
them may refer to some one age: This is a work which I find deficient, but
is to be Historia Prophetica.
done with wisdom, sobriety, and reverence, or not at all.

The third, which is HISTORY of PROVIDENCE, contains that excellent
correspondence, which is between Gods revealed will, and his secret will:
which though it be so obscure, as for the most part it is not legible to the
Natural Man; no, nor many times to those that behold it from the Tabernacle:
yet at some times it pleases God for our better establishment, and the
confuting of those which are as without God in the world; to write it in such
Text and Capital Letters, that, as the Prophet says, He that runs by, may
read it: that is, mere sensual persons, which hasten by Gods judgments, and
never bend or fix their cogitations upon them, are nevertheless in their
passage and race urged to discern it. Such are the notable events and examples
of Gods judgments, chastizements, deliverances and blessings: And this is a
work which has passed through the labor of many, and therefore I cannot
present as omitted.

There are also other parts of learning which are APPENDICES to HISTORY, for all
the exterior proceedings of man consist of Words and Deeds: whereof History
does properly receive, and retain in Memory the Deeds, and if Words, yet but
as Inducements and passages to Deeds: So are there other Books and Writings,
which are appropriat to the custody, and receite of Words only: which
likewise are of three sorts: ORATIONS, LETTERS, and BRIEF SPEECHES, or
SAYINGS: ORATIONS are pleadings, speeches of counsel; Laudatiues, Inuectiues,
Apologies, Reprehensions; Orations of Formalitie, or Ceremony, and the like:
Letters are according to all the variety of occasions; Aduertisments, Aduises,
Directions, Propositions, Peticions, Commendatorie, Expostulatorie,
Satisfactorie, of complement, of Pleasure, of Discourse, and all other passages
of Action. And such as are written from wise men, are, of all the words of Man,
in my judgment the best, for they are more Natural then Orations, and public
speeches, and more advised then co^ferences, or present speeches: So again
Letters of Affairs from such as Manage them, or are privy to them, are of all
others the best instructions for History, and to a diligent reader, the best
Histories in themselves. For APOTHEGMES: It is a great loss of that Book of
Caesar's; For as his History, and those few Letters of his which we have, and
those Apothegmes which were of his own, excel all men's else: So I suppose
would his collection of APOTHEGMES have done; For as for those which are
collected by others, either I have no taste in such Matters, or else their
choice has not been happy. But upon these three kinds of Writings I do not
insist, because I have no deficie^ces to propound concerning them,

Thus much therefore concerning History, which is that part of learning, which
answers to one of the Celles, Domiciles, or offices of the Mind of Man; which
is that of the Memory.

POESY is a part of Learning in measure of words for the most part restrained:
but in all other points extremely licensed: and does truly refer to the
Imagination: which being not tied to the Laws of Matter; may at pleasure
join that which Nature has severed: and sever that which Nature has joined,
and so make unlawful Matches and diuorses of things: Pictoribus atque Poetis
etc. It is taken in two senses in respect of Words or Matter; In the first
sense it is but a Character of style, and belongs to Arts of speech, and is
not pertinent for the present. In the later, it is (as has been said) one of
the principalll Portions of learning: and is nothing else but FAINED HISTORY,
which may be styled as well in Prose as in Verse.

The use of this FAINED HISTORY, has been to give some shadow of
satisfaction to the mind of Man in those points, wherein the Nature of things
does deny it, the world being in proportion inferior to the soul: by reason
whereof there is agreeable to the spirit of Man, a more ample Greatness, a
more exact Goodness; and a more absolute variety then can be found in the
Nature of things. Therefore, because the Acts or Events of true History, have
not that Magnitude, which satisfies the mind of Man, Poesy saineth Acts and
Events Greater and more Heroical; because true History propounds the
successes and issues of actions, not so agreeable to the merits of Virtue and
Vice, therefore Poesy faines them more just in Retribution, and more according
to Revealed Providence, because true History represents Actions and Events,
more ordinary and less interchanged, therefore Poesy endueth them with more
Rareness, and more unexpected, and alternatiue Variations. So as it appears
that Poesy serves and conferreth to Magnanimity, Morality, and to
delectation. And therefore it was ever thought to have some participation of
diuinesse, because it does raise and erect the Mind, by submitting the shows
of things to the desires of the Mind; whereas reason does buckle and bow the
Mind unto the Nature of things. And we see that by these insinuations and
congruities with man's Nature and pleasure, joined also with the agreement and
consort it has with Music, it has had access and estimation in rude times,
and barbarous Regions, where other learning stood excluded.

The division of Poesy which is aptest in the propriety thereof (besides those
diuisio^s which are common unto it with history: as fained Chronicles, fained
lives, and the Appe^dices of History, as fained Epistles, fained Orations, and
the rest) is into POESY NARRATIVE; REPRESENTATIVE, and ALLVSIVE. The NARRATIVE
is a mere imitation of History with the excesses before remembered; Ohoosing
for subject commonly Wars, and Love; rarely State, and sometimes Pleasure or
Mirth. REPRESENTATIVE is as a visible History, and is an Image of Actions as if
they were present, as History is of actions in nature as they are, that is
past; ALLVSIVE or PARABOLICALL, is a NARRTION applied only to express some
special purpose or conceit. Which later kind of Parabolical wisdom was much
more in use in the ancient times, as by the Fables of Aesope, and the brief
sentences of the seven, and the use of Hieroglyphikes may appear. And the
cause was for that it was then of necessity to express any point of reason,
which was more sharp or subtle then the vulgar in that manner, because men in
those times wanted both variety of examples, and subtlety of conceit: And as
Hierogliphikes were before Letters, so parables were before arguments: And
nevertheless now and at all times they do retain much life and vigor,
because reason cannot be so sensible, nor examples so fit.

But there remains yet another use of POESY PARABOLICAL, opposite to that
which we last mentioned: for that tends to demonstrate, and illustrate that
which is taught or delivered, and this other to retire and obscure it: That is
when the Secrets and Mysteries of Religion, Policy, or Philosophy, are
inuolued in Fables or Parables. Of this in divine Poesy, we see the use is
authorized. In Heathen Poesy, we see the exposition of Fables does fall out
sometimes with great felicity, as in the Fable that the Giants being
overthrown in their war against the Gods, the Earth their mother in revenge
thereof brought forth Fame.

Illam terra Parens ira irritata Deoru^, (Progenuit.
Extremam, vt perhibent, Coeo Enceladoque Sororem
expounded that when Princes and Monarchies have suppressed actual and open
Rebels, then the malignitic of people, which is the mother of Rebellion, does
bring forth Libels and slanders, and taxatio^s of the states, which is of the
same kind with Rebellion, but more Feminine: So in the Fable that the rest of
the Gods having conspired to bind Jupiter, Pallas called Briareus with his
hundredth hands to his aid, expounded, that Monarchies need not fear any
courbing of their absoluteness by Mighty Subjects, as long as by wisdom
they keep the hearts of the people, who will be sure to come in on their side:
So in the fable, that Achilles was brought up under Chyron the Centaure, who
was part a man, and part a beast, expounded Ingenuously, but corruptly by
Machiauell, that it belongs to the education and discipline of Princes, to
know as well how to play the part of the Lion, in violence, and the Fox in
guile, as of the man in virtue and Justice. Nevertheless in many the like
incounters, I do rather think that the fable was first, and the exposition
devised, then that the Moral was first, and thereupon the fable framed. For I
find it was an ancient vanity, in Chrisippus, that troubled himself with
great contention to fasten the assertions of the Stoics upon fictions of the
ancient Poets: But yet that all the Fables and fictions of the Poets, were but
pleasure and not figure, I interpose no opinion. Surely of those Poets which
are now extant, even Homer himself, (notwithstanding he was made a kind of
Scripture, by the later Schools of the Grecians) yet I should without any
difficulty pronounce, that his Fables had no such inwardnesse in his own
meaning: But what they might have, upon a more original tradition, is not
easy to affirm, for he was not the inuentor of many of them. In this third
part of Learning which is Poesy, I can report no deficience. For being as a
plant that comes of the lust of the earth, without a formal seed, it has
sprung up, and spread abroad, more then any other kind: But to ascribe unto it
that which is due: for the expressing of affections, passions, corruptions and
customs, we are beholding to Poets, more the^ to the Philosophers works, and
for wit and eloquence not much less then to Orators harangues. But it is not
good to stay too long in the Theater: let us now pass on to the judicial Place
or Palace of the Mind, which we are to approach and view, with more reverence
and attention.

The knowledge of Man is as the waters, some descending from above, and some
springing from beneath, the one informed by the light of Nature, the other
inspired by divine revelation. The light of Nature consists, in the Notions
of the mind, and the Reports of the Senses, for as for knowledge which Man
receives by teaching, it is Cumulatiue, and not Original, as in a water, that
besides his own spring-heade is fed with other Springs and Streams. So then
according to these two differing Illuminations, or Originals, Knowledge is
first of al divided into DIVINITY, and PHILOSOPHY.

In PHILOSOPHY, the contemplations of Man do either penetrate unto God, or are
circumferred to Nature, or are reflected or reuerted upon himself. Out of
which several inquiries, there do arise three knowledges, DIVINE PHILOSOPHY,
NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, and HVMANE PHILOSOPHY, or HVMANITIE. For all things are
marked and stamped with this triple Character of the power of God, the
difference of Nature, and the use of Man. But because the distributions and
partitions of knowledge, are not like several lines, that meet in one Angle,
and so touch but in a point, but are like branches of a tree, that meet in a
ste^me; which has a dimension and quantity of entyrenes and continuance,
before it come to discontinue and break it self into Arms and boughs,
therefore it is good, before we enter into the former distribution, to erect
and constitute one universal Science by the name of PHILOSOPHIA PRIMA,
PRIMITIVE or SVMMARIEPHILOSOPHIE, as the Maine and common way, before we come
where the ways part, and divide themselves, which Science whether I should
report as deficient or not, I stand doubtful. For I find a certain Rapsodie
of Natural Theology, and of diverse parts of Logic: And of that part of
Natural Philosophy, which concerns the Principles, and of that other part
of Natural Philosophy, which concerns the Soul or Spirit, all these
strangely commixed and confused: but being examined it seems to me rather a
depredation of other Sciences, advanced and exalted unto some height of
terms, then any thing solid or substantive of it self. Nevertheless I
cannot be ignorant of the distinction which is current, that the same things
are handled but in several respects: as for example that Logic considers
of many things as they are in Notion and this Philosophy, as they are in
Nature: the one in, Appearance, the other in Existence: But I find this
difference better made then pursued; For if they had considered Quantity,
Similitude, Diversity, and the rest of those Externe Characters of things, as
Philosophers, and in Nature: their inquiries must of force have been of a
far other kind then they are. For does any of them in handeling Quantity,
speak of the force of union, how, and how far it multiplieth virtue? Does
any give the reason, why some things in Nature are so common and in so great
Mass, and others so rare, and in so small quantity? Does any in handling
Similitude and Diversity, assign the cause why Iron should not move to Iron,
which is more like, but move to the Loadestone, which is less like? why in
all Diversities of things there should be certain Participles in Nature,
which are almost ambiguous, to which kind they should be referred? But there
is a mere and deep silence, touching the Nature and operation of those Common
adjuncts of things, as in Nature; and only a resuming and repeating of the
force and use of them, in speech or argument. Therefore because in a Writing
of this Nature, I avoid all subtilitie: my meaning touching this Original or
universal Philosophy, is thus in a plain and gross description by Negative:
That it be a Receptacle for all such profitable observations and Axioms, as
fall not within the compass of any of the special parts of Philosophy, or
Sciences; but are more common, and of a higher stage.

Now that there are many of that kind need not be doubted: for example; Is
not the rule: Si inaequalibus aequalia addas; omnia erunt inaequal^a. An Axiom
as well of Justice; as of the Mathematiques? And is there not a true coincidence
between commutatiue and distributive Justice, and Arithmeticall and
Geometrical proportion? Is not that over rule, Quae in eodem tertio
convenient, and inter se convenient, a Rule taken from the Mathematiques, but
so potent in Logic as all Syllogismes are built upon it? Is not the
observation, Omnia mutantur, nilinterit, a contemplation in Philosophy thus,
that the Quantum of Nature is eternal, In Natural Theology thus. That it
requires the same Omnipotency to make somewhat Nothing, which at the first
made nothing somewhat? according to the Scripture, Di^ici quod omnia operaquae
fecil Deus, perseuerent in perpetuum, non possumus eis qui^quam addere, nec
auferre. Is not the ground which Machtavill wisely and largely discourses
concerning Governments, That the way to establish and preserve them, is to
reduce them ad Principia; a rule in Religion and Nature, as well as in Civil
administration? was not the Persian Magic a reduction or correspondence of
the Principles and Architectures of Nature, to the rules and policy of
Governments? Is not the precept of a Musician, to ^all from a discord or harsh
accord, upon a concord, or sweet accord, alike true in affection? Is not the
Trope of Musi^ke, to avoid or slide from the close or Cadence, common with the
Trope of Rh^ricke of deceyuing expectation? Is not the delight of the Quavering
upon a stop in Music, the same with the playing of Light upon the water?

Spiendet tremulo sub Lumine Pon^
Are not the Organs of the senses of one ki^ with the Organs of Reflection, the
Eye with a gla^ the Eat with a Cave or Straight determined and bounded?
Neither are these only similitud^s, as men of narrow observation may conc^yue
them to be; but the same footesteppes of Nature, treading or printing upon
several subjects or Matters. This Science therefore (as I understand (...)) I
may ^
justly report as deficient; for I see sometimes the profounder sort of
wits, in handeling some particular argument, will now and then draw a
Bucket of Water out of this well, for their present use. But the springhead
thereof seems to me, not to have been visited; being of so excellent use,
both for the disclosing of Nature, and the abridgement of Art.

This science being therefore first placed as a common parent, like unto
Berecinthia, which had so much Heavenly issue, Omnes Coe^colas, omnes super
alta tenentes; we may return to the former distribution of the three
philosophies; Divine, Natural, and Humane. And as concerning DIVINE
PHILOSOPHY. Or NATVRALL THEOLOGY, It is that knowledge or Rudiment of
knowledge concerning GOD, which may be obtained by the contemplation of his
Creatures which knowledge may be truly termed Divine, in respect of the
object; and Natural in respect of the Light. The bounds of this knowledge
are, that it suffices to convince Atheism; but not to inform Religion: And
therefore there was never Miracle wrought by God to convert an Atheist, because
the light of Nature might have led him to confess a God: But Miracles have
been wrought to convert Idolaters, and the superstitious, because no light of
Nature extends to declare the will and true worship of God. For as all works
do show forth the power and skill of the workman, and not his Image: So it is
of the works of God; which do show the Omnipotency and wisdom of the Maker,
but not his Image: And therefore therein the Heathen opinion differs from the
Sacred truth: For they supposed the world to be the Image of God, and Man to
be an extract or compendious Image of the world: But the Scriptures never
vouch-safe to attribute to the world that honor as to be the Image of God:
But only The work of his hands, Neither do they speak of any other Image of
God, but Man: wherefore by the contemplation of Nature, to induce and enforce
the acknowledgement of God, and to demonstrate his power, providence, and
goodness, is an excellent argument, and has been excellently handled by
diverse. But on the other side, out of the contemplation of Nature, or ground
of humane knoweledges to induce any verity, or persuasion concerning the
points of Faith, is in my judgment, not fate: Dafidei, quae fidei sunt. For
the Heathen themselves conclude as much in that excellent and Divine fable of
the Golden Chain: That men and Gods were not able to draw Jupiter down to the
Earth, but contrariwise, Jupiter was able to draw them up to Heaven. So as we
ought not to attempt to draw down or submit the Mysteries of GOD to our
Reason: but contrariwise, to raise and advance our Reason to the Divine Truth.
So as in this part of knowledge, touching Divine Philosophy: I am so far
from noting any deficience, as I rather note an excess: whereunto I have
digressed, because of the extreme prejudice, which both Religion and
Philosophy has received, and may receive by being commixed together; as that
which undoubtedly will make an Heretical Religion; and an Imaginary and
fabulous Philosophy.

Otherwise it is of the Nature of Angels and Spirits, which is an Appendix of
Theology, both Divine and Natural; and is neither inscrutable nor
interdicted: For although the Scripture says, Let no man deceive you in
Sublime discourse touching the worship of Angels, pressing into that he
knows not, etc. Yet notwithstanding if you observe well that precept, it may
appear thereby, that there be two things only forbidden, Adoration of them,
and Opinion Fantastical of them, either to extol them, further then
appertains to the degree of a Creature; or to extol a man's knowledge of
them, further then he has ground. But the sober and grounded inquiry which
may arise out of the passages of holy Scriptures, or out of the gradacions of
Nature is not restrained: So of degenerate and revolted spirits; the
conuersing with them, or the imployement of them is prohibited; much more any
veneration toward them. But the contemplacion or science of their Nature,
their power, their illusions; either by Scripture or reason, is apart of
spiritual Wisdom. For so the Apostle says, We are not ignorant of his
Stratagems: And it is no more unlawful to enquire the Nature of evil
spirits, then to enquire the force of poisons in Nature, or the Nature of
sin and vice in Morality; But this part touching Angels and Spirits, I
cannot note as deficient, for many have occupied themselves in it: I may rather
challenge it in many of the Writers thereof, as fabulous and fantastical.

Leaving therefore DIVINE PHILOSOPHY, or NATVRALL THEOLOGY, (not DIVINITY, or
INSPIRED THEOL'OGIE, which we reserve for the last of all, as the Haven and
Sabbath of all Man's contemplations) we will now proceed to NATVRALL
PHILOSOPHY: If then it be true that Democritus said, That the truth of
Nature lies hid in certain deep My^ and Caves; And if it be true
likewise, that the Alchymists do so much inculcate, That Vulcan is a second
Nature, and imitateth that dexterouslie and compendiouslie, which Nature
works by ambages, and length of time, It were good to divide Natural
Phylosophie into the Mine and the Furnace, and to make two professions or
occupations of Natural Philosophers, some to be Pionners, and some Smythes,
some to dig, and some to refine, and Hammer: And surely I do best allow of
a division of that kind, though in more familiar and scholasticall terms:
Namely that these be the two parts of Natural Philosophy, the INQVISITION OF
CAUSES, and the PRO^VCTION OF EFFECTS: SPECVLATIVE, and OPERATIVE, NATVRALL
SCIENCE, and NATVRALL PRVDENCE. For as in Civil matters there is a wisdom of
discourse, and a wisdom of direction: So is it in Natural: And here I will
make a request, that for the latter (or at least for a part thereof) I may
reviue and reintegrate the misapplyed and abused Name of NATVRALL MAGIC,
which in the true sense, is but NATVRALL WISDOM, or NATVRALL PRVDENCE: taken
according to the ancient acception, purged from vanity and superstition. Now
although it be true, and I know it well, that ther^ is an intercourse between
Causes and Eff^, so as both these knowledges (...) and (...) a great connection
between themselves: yet because all true and fruitful NATVRALL PHILOSOPHY,
has A double Scale or Ladder, Ascendent and Descendent, ascending from
experiments to the Invention of causes; and descending from causes, to the
Invention of new experiments; Therefore I judge it most requisite that these
two parts be severally considered and handled.

NATVRALL SCIENCE or THEORY is divided into PHYSIC and METAPHISICKE, wherein
I desire, it may be conceived, that I use the word METAPHISICKE in a differing
sense, from that, that is received: And in like manner I doubt not, but it will
easily appear to men of judgment, that in this and other particulers,
wheresoever my Conception and Notion may differ from the Ancient, yet I am
studious to keep the Ancient Terms. For hoping well to deliver my self from
mistaking, by the order and perspicuous expressing of that I do propounde: I
am otherwise zealous and affectionate to recede as little from Antiquity,
either in terms or opinions, as may stand with truth, and the proficience of
knowledge: And herein I cannot a little marvel at the Philosopher Aristotle:
that did proceed in such a Spirit of difference and contradiction toward all
Antiquity, undertaking not only to frame new words of Science at pleasure:
but to confound and extinguish all ancient wisdom; insomuch as he never
names or mentions an Ancient Author or opinion, but to confute and reprove:
wherein for glory, and drawing followers and disciples, he took the right
course. For certainly there comes to pass, and has place in humane truth,
that which was noted and pronounced in the highest truth: Veni in nomine
Patris, nec recipitis Me, Si quis venerit in nomine suo, eum recipietis. But in
this divine Aphorism (considering, to whom it was applied, Namely to
Antichrist, the highest deceiuer,) we may discern well, that the coming in a
Man's own name, without regard of Antiquity, or paternitie; is no good sign
of truth; although it be joined with the fortune and success of an Eum
recipietis. But for this excellent person Aristotle, I will think of him, that
he learned that humor of his Scholar; with whom, it seems, he did
emulate, the one to conquer all Opinions, as the other to conquer all Nations.
Wherein nevertheless it may be, he may at some men's hands, that are of a
bitter disposition, get a like title as his Scholar did.

Foelix terrarum Praedo, non vtile mundo
Editus exemplum etc. So
Foelix doctrinae Praedo.
But to me on the other side that do desire as much as lies in my Pen, to
ground a sociable intercourse between Antiquity and Proficience, it seems
best, to keep way with Antiquity vsque ad aras; And therefore to retain the
ancient terms, though I sometimes alter the uses and definitions, according
to the Moderate proceeding in Civil government; where although there be some
alteration, yet that holds which Tacitus wisely notes, Eadem Magistratuum
vocabula.

To return therefore to the use and acception of the term METAPHISICKE, as I
do now understand the word; It appears by that which has been already
said, that I intend, PHILOSOPHIA PRIMA: SVMMARIE PHILOSOPHY and METAPHISICK,
which heretofore have been confounded as one, to be two distinct things. For
the one I have made as a Parent, or common Auncestor to all knowledge; And the
other I have now brought in, as a Branch or descendent of NATVRALL SCIENCE; It
appears likewise that I have assigned to SVMMARIEPHILOSOPHIE the common
principles and Axioms which are promiscuous and indifferent to several
Sciences: I have assigned unto it likewise the inquiry touching the operation
of the Relative and aduentiue Characters of Essences, as Quantity, Similitude,
Diversity, Possibility, and the rest: with this distinction, and provision:
that they be handled as they have efficacy in Nature, and not logically. It
appears likewise that NATURAL THEOLOGY which hereto fore has been handled
confusedly with METAPHISICKE, I have enclosed and bounded by it self. It is
therefore now a question, what is left remaining for METAPHISICKE: wherein I
may without prejudice preserve thus much of the conceit of Antiquity; that
PHYSIC should contemplate that which is inherent in Matter, and therefore
transitory, and METAPHISICKE, that which is abstracted and fixed. And again
that PHYSIC should handle that which supposes in Nature only a being and
moving, and METAPHISICKE should handle that which supposes further in Nature, a
reason, understanding, and platform. But the difference perspicuously
expressed, is most familiar and sensible. For as we divided NATVRALL
PHILOSOPHY in GENERAL into the ENQVIRIE of CAUSES and PRODVCTIONS of EFFECTS:
So that part which concerns the ENQVIRIE of CAUSES, we do subdiuide,
according to the received and sound division of CAUSES; The one part which is
PHYSIC enquireth and handles the MATERIAL and EFFICIENT CAUSES, and the
other which is METAPHISICKE handles the FORMAL and FINALCAVSES.

PHYSIC, (taking it according to the deriuation, and not according to our
Idiome, for MEDICINE) is situate in a middle term or distance between
NATVRALL HISTORY and METAPHISICKE. For NATURAL HISTORY describes the variety
of things: PHYSIC the CAUSES, but VARIABLE or RESPECTIVE CAUSES; and
METAPHISICKE the FIXED and CONSTANT CAUSES.

Limus vt hic durescit, and haec vt Cara liquescit,
Vno eodemque igni.
Fire is the cause of induration, but respective to clay: Fire is the cause of
colliquatio^, but respective to Wax. But fire is noe constant cause either of
induration or colliquation: So then the Phificall causes are but the Efficient
and the Matter. PHYSIC has three parts, whereof two respect Nature United or
collected, the third conte^plateth Nature diffused or distributed. Nature is
collected either into one entyer Total, or else into the same Principles or
Seeds. So as the first doctrine is TOUCHING the CONTEXTVRE or CONFIGVRATION of
THINGS, as De Mundo, de vniuersitate Rerum. The second is the Doctrine
CONCERNING the PRINCIPLES or ORIGINALS of THINGS; The third is the doctrine
CONCERNING all VARIETY and PARTICVLARITIE of THINGS; whether it be of the
differing substances, or their differing qualities and Natures; whereof there
needs noe enumeration; this part being but as a GLOS or PARAPHRASE that
attends upon the Text of NATURAL HISTORY. Of these three I cannot report any
as deficient, In what truth or perfection they are handled, I make not now any
Judgment: But they are parts of knowledge not deserted by the Labor of Man.

For METAPHISICKE, we have assigned unto it the inquiry of FORMAL and FINAL
CAUSES which assignation, as to the former of them may seem to be Nugatorie
and void, because of the received and inueterate Opinion, that the inquisition
of Man, is not competent to find out essential forms, or true differences;
of which opinion we will take this hold: That the Invention of Forms is of al
other Parts of Knowledge the worthiest to be sought, if it be Possible to be
Found. As for the possibility, they are ill discouerers, that think there is
no land when they can see nothing but Sea. But it is manifest, that Plato in
his opinion of Ideas, as one that had a wit of elevation s^uate as upon a
Cliffe, did descry, that forms were the true object of knowledge; but lost the
real fruit of his opinion by considering of forms, as absolutely abstracted
from Matter, and not confined and determined by Matter: and so turning his
opinion upon Theology, wherewithal his Natural Philosophy is infected. But
if any man shall keep a continual watchful and severe eye upon action,
operation, and the use of knowledge, he may advise and take Notice, what are
the forms, the disclosures whereof are fruitful and important to the State of
Man. For as to the forms of substa^ces (Man only except, of whom it is said,
Formavit hominem de limoterrae, and spirauit in faciem eius spiraculum vitae,
and not as of all other creatures, Producant aquae, producat terra, the forms
of Substances I say (as they are now by compounding and transplanting
multiplied) are so perplexed, as they are not to be enquired. Noe more then it
were either possible or to purpose, to seek in gross the forms of those
Soundes which make words, which by composition and transposition of Letters
are infinite. But on the otherside, to enquire the form of those Soundes or
Voices which make simple Letters is easily comprehe^sible, and being known,
induces and manifests the forms of all words, which consist, and are
compounded of them; in the same manner to enquire the form of a Lion, of an
Oak, of Gold: Nay of Water, of Air, is a vain pursuit: But to enquire the
forms of Sense, of voluntary Motion, of Vegetation, of Colors, of Gravity
and Leuitie, of Densitie, of Tenuitie, of Heat, of Cold, and al other Natures
and qualities, which like an Alphabet are not many, and of which the essences
(vpheld by Matter) of all creatures do consist: To enquire I say the true
forms of these, is that part of METAPHISICKE, which we now define of. Not but
that PHYSIC does make inquiry, and take consideration of the same Natures,
but how? Only, as to the material and efficient causes of them, and not as to
the forms. For example, if the cause of whiteness in Snow or froth be
enquired, and it be rendered thus: That the subtle intermixture of Air and
water is the cause, it is well rendered, but nevertheless is this the form of
whiteness? Noe but Metaphisica sieve De formis and F^bus Reru^.
it is the efficient, which is ever but vehiculum formae. This, part of
METAPHISICKE: I do not find labored and performed, whereat I marvel not,
Because I hold it not possible to be invented by that course of invention
which has been used, in regard that men (which is the Root of all error)
have made too untimely a departure, and to remote a recesse from particulars.

But the use of this part of METAPHISICKE which I report as deficient, is of
the rest the most excellent in two respects: The one because it is the duty
and virtue of all knowledge to abridge the infinity of individual experience,
as much as the conception of truth will permit, and to remedy the complaint of
vita brevis, ars longa; which is performed by uniting the Notions and
conceptions of Sciences: For knowledges are as PYRAMIDES, whereof HISTORY is
the BASIS: So of NATURAL PHILOSOPHY the BASIS is NATURAL HISTORY: The STAGE
next the BASIS is PHYSIC: The STAGE next the VERTICALPOINT is METAPHISICKE:
As for the VERTICALLPOINT, Opus quod operatur deus a principio vsque ad finem,
the Summary law of Nature, we know not whether Man's inquiry can attain unto
it. But these three be the true Stages of knowledge, and are to them that are
depraved no better then the Giants Hills.

Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam:
Scilicet atque Ossaefrondosum involuere Olympum.
But to those which refer all things to the Glory of GOD, they are as the
three acclamations: Sancte, Sancte, Sancte: holy in the description or
dilatation of his works, holy in the connection, or concatenation of them, and
holy in the union of them in a perpetual and uniform law. And therefore the
speculation was excellent in Parmenides and Plato, although but a speculation
in them, That all things by scale did ascend to unity. So then always that
knowledge is worthiest, which is charged with least multiplicitie, which
appears to be METAPHISICKE, as that which considers the simple forms or
differences of things, which are few in number, and the degrees and
coordinations whereof, make all this variety: The second respect which valueth
and commends this part of METAPHISICKE is, that it does enfranchise the power
of Man unto the greatest liberty, and possibility of works and effects. For
Physic carries men in narrow and restrained ways, subject to many accidents
of impedime^ts, imitating the ordinary flexuous courses of Nature, But Latae
vndique sunt sapientibus viae: To sapience (which was anciently defined to be
Rerum diuinarum, and humanarum scientia) there is ever choice of Means. For
Physical causes give light to new invention in Simili materia; But whosoever
knows any form knows the utmost possibility of superinducing that Nature
upon any variety of Matter, and so is less restrained in operation, either to
the Basis of the Matter, or the condition of the efficient: which kind of
knowledge Solomon likewise, though in a more divine sort elegantly describes,
Non arctabuntur gressus tui, and currens non habebis offendiculum. The ways of
sapience are not much liable, either to particularitie or chance.

The 2. part of METAPHISICKE is the ENQIRY of FINAL CAUSES, which I am moved to
report, not as omitted, but as misplaced; And yet if it were but a fault in
order, I would not speak of it. For order is matter of illustration, but
pertains not to the substance of Sciences: But this misplacing has caused a
deficience, or at least a great improficience in the Sciences themselves. For
the handling of final causes mixed with the rest in Physical enquiries, has
intercepted the severe and diligent inquiry of all real and physical causes,
and given men the occasion, to stay upon these satisfactorie and specious
causes, to the great arrest and prejudice of further discovery. For this I
find done not only by Plato, who ever ancreth upon that shore, but by
Aristotle, Galen, and others, which do usually likewise fall upon these
flatts of discoursing causes; For to say that the hairs of the Eye-liddes are
for a quic-sette and fence about the Sight: Or, That the firmness of the
Skins and Hides of living creatures is to defend them from the extremities of
heat or cold: Or, That the bones are for the columns or beams, whereupon the
Frame of the bodies of living creatures are built; Or, That the leaves of trees
are for protecting of the Fruit; Or, That the clouds are for watering of the
Eearth; Or, That the solidnesse of the Earth is for the station and Mansion of
living creatures: and the like, is well inquired and collected in METAPHISICKE,
but in PHYSIC they are impertinent. Nay, they are indeed but Remoraes and
binderances to stay and slugge the Ship from further sailing, and have brought
this to pass, that the search of the Physical Causes has been neglected,
and passed in silence. And therefore the Natural Philosophy of Democritus, and
some others who did not suppose a Mind or Reason in the frame of things, but
attributed the form thereof able to maintain it self to infinite essaies or
proofs of Nature, which they term fortune; seems to me (as far as I can
judge by the recital and fragments which remain unto us) in particularities
of Physical causes more real and better enquired then that of Aristotle and
Plato, whereof both intermingled final causes, the one as a part of Thelogie,
and the other as a part of Logic, which were the favorite studies
respectively of both those persons. Not because those final causes are not
true, and worthy to be inquired, being kept within their own province; but
because their excursions into the limits of Physical causes, has bred a
vastness and solitude in that tract. For otherwise keeping their precincts and
borders, men are extremely deceived if they think there is an Enmity or
repugnancie at all between them: For the cause rendered that the hairs about
the Eye liddes are for the safeguard of the sight, does not impugn the cause
rendered, that Pilositie is incident to Orisices of Moisture: Muscosi fontes
etc. Nor the cause rendered that the firmness of hides is for the armor of
the body against extremities of heat or cold: does not impugn the cause
rendered, that contraction of pores is incident to the outwardest parts; in
regard of their adiacence to foreign or unlike bodies, and so of the rest;
both causes being true and compatible, the one declaring an intention, the
other a consequence only. Neither does this call in question or derogate from
diuin^ Providence, but highly confirm and exalt it. Fo^s in civil actions he
is the greater and deeper pollitique, that can make other men the Instruments
of his will and ends, and yet never acquaint them with his purpose: So as they
shall do it, and yet not know what they do, then he that imparteth his
meaning to those he employeth: So is the wisdom of God more admirable, when
Nature intends one thing, and Providence draws forth another; then if he
had communicated to particular Creatures and Motions the Characters and
Impressions of his Providence; And thus much for METAPHISICKE, the later part
whereof, I allow as extant, but wish it confined to his proper place.

Nevertheless there remains yet another part of NATVRALL PHILOSOPHY, which
is commonly made a principal part, and holds rank with PHYSIC special
and METAPHISICKE: which is Mathematicke, but I think it more agreeable to the
Nature of things, and to the light of order, to place it as a Branch of
Metaphisicke: For the subject of it being Quantity, not Quantity Indefinite:
which is but a Relative, and belongs to Philosophia Prima (as has been
said,) but Quantity determined, or proportionable, it appears to be one of
the essential forms of things; as that, that is causatiue in Nature of a
number of Effects, insomuch as we see^ the Schools both of Democritus, and of
Pithagoras, that the one did ascribe Figure to the first seeds of things, and
the other did suppose numbers to be the principalles and originalls of things;
And it is true also that of all other forms (as we understand forms) it is
the most abstracted, and separable from matter and therefore most proper to
Metaphisicke; which has likewise been the cause, why it has been better
labored, and enquired, then any of the other forms, which are more immersed
into Matter. For it being the Nature of the Mind of Man (to the extreme
prejudice of knowledge) to delight in the spacious liberty of generalities, as
in a champion Region; and not in the enclosures of particularitie; the
MATHEMATICS of all other knowledge were the goodliest fields to satisfy that
appetite. But for the placing of this Science, it is not much Material: only
we have endeavored in these our Partitions to observe a kind of perspectiue,
that one part may cast light upon another.

The MATHEMATICS are either PVRE, or MIXED: To the PVRE MATHEMATICS are those
Sciences belonging, which handle Quantity determinate merely severed from any
Axioms of NATVRALL PHLOSOPHY: and these are two, GEOMETRY and ARITHMETICKE,
The one handling Quantity continued, and the other disseuered. MIXED has for
subject some Axioms or parts of Natural Philosopie: and considers Quantity
determined, as it is auxiliarie and incident unto them. For many parts of
Nature can neither be invented with sufficient subtlety, nor demonstrated with
sufficient perspicuitie, nor accommodated unto use with sufficient dexterity,
without the aid and interueyning of the Mathematics: of which sort are
Perspectiue, Music, Astronomy, Cosmographie, Architecture, Inginarie, and
diverse others. In the Mathematics, I can report noe deficience, except it be
that men do not sufficiently understand the excellent use of the pure
Mathematics, in that they do remedy and cure many defects in the Wit, and
Faculties Intellectual. For, if the wit be to dull, they sharpen it: if to
wandering, they fix it: if to inherent in the sense, they abstract it. So that,
as Tennis is a game of noe use in it self, but of great use, in respect it
makes a quick Eye, and a body ready to put it self into all Postures: So
in the Mathematickes, that use which is collateral and interuenient, is no
less worthy, then that which is principal and intended. And as for the Mixed
Mathematikes I may only make this prediction, that there cannot fail to be
more kinds of them, as Nature grows further disclosed. Thus much of NATURAL
SCIENCE, or the part of Nature SPECVLATIVE.

For NATVRALL PRVDENCE, or the part OPERATIVE of NATVRALL PHILOSOPHY, we will
divide it into three parts, EXPERIMENTAL, PHILOSOPHICAL and MAGICAL, which
three parts ACTIVE have a corresponde^ce and Analogy with the three parts
SPECVLATIVE: NATURAL HISTORY, PHYSIC, and METAPHISICKE: For many operations
have bin invented sometime by a casual incidence and occurrence, sometimes by
a purposed experiment: and of those which have been found by an intentionall
experime^t, some have bin found out by varying or extending the same
experiment, some bytransferring and compounding diverse experiments the one into
the other, which kind of invention an Emperique may manage. Again by the
knowledge of Physical causes, there cannot fail to follow, many indications
and designations of new particulers, if men in their speculation will keep one
eye upon use and practice. But these are but Coastings along the shore,
Premendo littus iniquum, For it seems to me, there can hardly be discovered
any radical or fundamental alterations, and innouations in Nature, either by
the fortune and essays of experiments, or by the light and direction of
Phisical causes. If therefore we have reported METAPHISICKE deficient, it must
follow, Naturalis Magiasiue Phisica Operatiua Mayor.
that we do the like of NATURAL MAGIC, which has relation thereunto. For
as for the NATURAL MAGIC whereof now there is mention in books, containing
certain credulous and superstitious conceits and observations of sympathies,
and Antipathies and hidden Proprieties, and some frivolous experiments, strnnge
rather by disguisement, then in themselves, It is as fardiffering in truth of
Nature, from such a knowedge as we require, as the story of King Arthur of
Britain, or Hughe of Bordeaux, differs from Caesar's commentaries in truth of
story. For it is manifest that Caesar did greater things de vero, then those
Imaginary Heroes were fained to do. But he did them not in that fabulous
manner. Of this kind of learning the fable of Ixion was a figure: who designed
to enjoy Juno the Goddess of power: and in stead of her, had copulation with a
Cloud: of which mixture were begotten Centaures, and Chymeraes. So whosoever
shall entertain high and vapourous imaginations, in steed of a laborious and
sober inquiry of truth shall beget hopes and Beliefes of strange and
impossible shapes. And therefore we may note in these Sciences, which hold so
much of imagination and Belief, as this degenerate Natural Magic, Alchimie,
Astrology, and the like, that in their propositions, the description of the
means, is evermore monstrous, then the pretense or end. For it is a thing
more probable, that he that knows well the Natures of Weight, of Color, of
Pliant, and fragile in respect of the hammer, of volatile and fixed in respect
of the fire, and the rest, may superinduce upon some Metal the Nature, and
form of Gold by such Mechanique as longs to the production of the Naturs
before rehearsed, then that some graynes of the Medecin proiected, should in a
few Moments of time, turn a Sea of Quicksilver or other Material into Gold.
So it is more probable that he that knows the Nature of Arefaction; the
Nature of assimilation, of nourishment to the thing nourished; the Manner of
increase, and clearing of spirits: the Manner of the depredations, which Spirits
make upon the humors and solid parts: shall, by Ambages of diets, bathings,
annointings, Medecines, motions, and the like, prolong life, or restore some
degree of youth or viuacitie, then that it can be done with the use of a sewe
drops, or scruples of a liquor or receite. To conclude therefore, the true
NATVRALL MAGIC, which is that great liberty and Latitude of operation, which
depends upon the knowledge of forms, I may report deficient, as the
Relative thereof is; To which part if we be serious, and incline not to
vanities and plausible discourse, besides the deriuing and deducing the
operations themselves from METAPHISICKE, there are pertinent two points of much
purpose, the one by way of preparation, the other by way of caution: The first
is, that there be made a Calendar resembling an Inventory of the estate of
man, containing all the Inuentarium Opum bumanarum.
inventions, (being the works or fruits of Nature or Art) which are now extant,
and whereof man is already possessed, out of which does naturally result a
Note, what things are yet held impossible, or not invented, which Calendar will
be the more artificial and serviceable, if to every reputed impossibility,
you add what thing is extant, which comes the nearest in degree to that
Impossibility; to the end, that by these Optatiues and Potentialls, Man's
inquiry may be the more awake in diducing direction of works from the
speculatio^ of causes. And secondly that those experime^ts be not only
esteemed which have an immediate and present use, but those principally which
are of most universal consequence for invention of other experime^ts, and
those which give most light to the Inue^tion of causes; for the Inue^tion of
the Mariners Needle, which gives the direction, is of noe less benefit for
Navigations, then the invention of the sails which give the Motion.

Thus have I passed through NATVRALL PHILOSOPHY, and the deficiences thereof;
wherein if I have differed from the ancient, and received doctrines, and
thereby shall move contradiction; for my part, as I affect not to dissent, so I
purpose not to contend; If it be truth.

-- Non canimus surdis respondent omnia syluae;
The voice of Nature will consent, whether the voice of Man do or not. And as
Alexander Bergia was wont to say of the expedition of the french for Naples,
that they came with Chaulke in their hands to mark up their lodgings, and not
with weapons to fight: So I like better that entry of truth which comes
peaceably with Chaulke, to mark up those Minds, which are capable to lodge
and harbor it, then that which comes with pugnacitie and contention.

But there remains a division of Natural Philosophy according to the Report
of the Inquiry, and nothing concerning the Matter or subject, and that is
POSITIVE and CONSIDERATIVE: when the inquiry reports either an Assertion, or
a Doubt. These doubts or Non Liquets, are of two sorts, Particular and Total.
For the first we see a good example thereof in Aristotle's Problemes, which
deserved to have had a better continuance, but so nevertheless, as there is
one point, whereof warning is to be given and taken; The Registring of doubts
has two excellent uses: The one that it saves Philosophy from Errors and
falsehoods: when that which is not fully appearing, is not collected into
assertion, whereby Error might draw Error, but reserved in doubt. The other
that the entry of doubts are as so many suckers or sponges, to draw use of
knowledge, insomuch as that which if doubts had not preceded, a man should
never have advised, but passed it over without Note, by the suggestion and
solicitation of doubts is made to be attended and applied. But both these
commodities do scarcely counteruaile an Inconvenience, which will intrude it
self if it be not debarred, which is that when a doubt is once received, men
labor rather how to keep it a doubt still, then how to solue it, and
accordingly bend their wits. Of this we see the familiar example in Lawyers and
Scholars, both which if they have once admitted a doubt, it goes ever after
Authorized for a doubt. But that use of wit and knowledge is to be allowed
which labors to make doubtful things certain, and not those which labor
to make certain things doubtful. Therefore these Kalenders of doubts, I
commend as excellent things, so that there be this caution used, that when they
be thoroughly sifted and brought to resolution, they be from thence forth
omitted, decarded, and not continued to cherish and encourage men in doubting.
Continuatio Problematum in Natura. Catalogus Falsitatu^ grassantiu^ in historia
Naturae.
To which Calendar of doubts or problemes, I advise be annexed another Calendar
as much or more Material, which is a Calendar of popular Errors, I mean
chiefly, in natural History such as pass in speech and conceit, and are
nevertheless apparently detected and co^uicted of untruth, that Man's knowledge
be not weakened nor imbased by such dross and vanity. As for the Doubts or
Nonliquets general or in Total, I understand those differences of opinions
touching the principles of Nature, and the fundamental points of the same,
which have caused the diversity of Sects, Schools, and Philosophies, as that
of Empedocles, Pythagoras, Democritus, Parmenides, and the rest. For although
Aristotle as though he had bin of the race of the Ottomans, thought he could
not reign, except the first thing he did he killed all his Brethren; yet to
those that seek truth and not Magistralitie, it cannot but seem a Matter of
great profit, to see before them the several opinions touching the foundations
of Nature, not for any exact truth that can be expected in those Theories: For
as the same Phenomena in Astronomy are satisfied by the received Astronomy of
the diurnall Motion, and the proper Motions of the Planets, with their
Eccentriques and Epicicles and likewise by the Theorie of Copernicus, who
supposed the ^arth to move; and the Calculations are indifferently agreeable to
both: So the ordinary face and view of experience is many times satisfied by
several Theories and Philosophies, whereas to find the real truth requires
another manner of severity and attention. For, as Aristotle says that
children at the first will call every woman mother: but afterward they come to
distinguish according to truth: So Experience, if it be in childhood, will call
every Philosophy Mother; but when it comes to ripeness, it will discern
the true Mother. So as in the mean time it is good to see the Several Glosses
and Opinions upon Nature, whereof De Antiquis Philosophijs.
it may be every one in some one point, has seen clearer then his fellows;
Therefore I wish some collection to be made painfully and understandingly de
Antiquis Philosophijs out of all the possible light which remains to us of
them. Which kind of work I find deficient. But here I must give warning,
that it be done distinctly and severely; The Philosophies of every one
throughout by themselves; and not by titles packed, and fagotted up together,
as has been done by Plutarch. For it is the harmony of a Philosophy in it
self, which gives it light and credence; whereas if it be singled and
broken, it will seem more foreign and dissonant. For as, when I read in
Tacitus, the Actions of Nero, or Claudius, with circumstances of times,
inducements and occasions, I find them not so strange: but when I read them
in Suetonius Tranquillus gathered into tytles and bundles, and not in order of
time, they seem more monstrous and incredible; So is it of any Philosophy
reported entier, and dismembered by Articles. Neither do I exclude opinions of
latter times to be likewise represented, in this Calendar of Sects of
Philosophy, as that of Theophrastus Paracelsus, eloquently reduced into an
harmony, by the Pen of Seuerinus the Dane: And that of Tylesius, and his
Scholar Donius, being as a Pastoral Philosophy, full of sense, but of no
great depth. And that of Fracastorius, who though he pretended not to make any
new Philosophy, yet did use the absoluteness of his own sense, upon the
old. And that of Gilbertus, our countreyman, who revived, with some
alterations, and demonstrations, the opinions of Xenophanes, and any other
worthy to be admitted. Thus have we now dealt with two of the three beams of
Man's knowledge, that is Radius Directus, which is referred to Nature, Radius
Refractus, which is referred to God, and cannot report truly because of the
inequality of the Medium. There rests Radius Reflexus, whereby Man beholds
and contemplateth himself.

WE come therefore now to that knowledge, whereunto the ancient Oracle
directs us, which is, the knowledge of our selves: which deserves the more
accurate handling, by how much it touches us more nearly. This knowledge as
it is the end and Term of Natural Philosophy in the intention of Man: So
notwithstanding it is but a portion of Natural Philosophy in the continent of
Nature: And generally let this be a Rule, that all partitions of knowledges, be
accepted rather for lines and veins, then for sections and separations: and
that the continuance and entirenes of knowledge be preserved. For the contrary
here of has made particular Sciences, to become barren, shallow, and
erroneous: while they have not bin N^urished and Maintained from the common
fountain: Sow see Cicero the Orator complained of Socrates and his School,
that he was the first that separated Philosophy, and Rhetoric, whereupon
Rhetoric became an empty and verbal Art. So we may see that the opinion of
Copernicus touching the rotation of the earth, which Astronomy it self cannot
correct; because it is not repugnant to any of the Phainomena, yet Natural
Philosophy may correct. So we see also that the Science of Medicine, if it be
destituted and forsaken by Natural Philosophy, it is not much better then an
Empeirical practice: with this reservation therefore we proceed to HVMANE
PHILOSOPHY or HVMANITIE, which has two parts: The one considers Man
segregate, or distributiuely: The other congregate or in society. So as HVMANE
PHILOSOPHY is either SIMPLE and PARTICVLAR, or coniugate and Civil; HVMANITIE
PARTICVLAR consists of the same parts, whereof Man consists, that is, of
KNOVVLEDGES WHICH RESPECT THE BODY, and of KNOVVLEDGES THAT RESPECT THE MIND.
But before we distribute so far, it is good to constitute. For I do take the
consideration in general, and at large of HVMANE NATVRE to be fit to be
emancipate, and made a knowledge by it self; Not so much in regard of those
delightful and elegant discourses, which have bin made of the dignity of Man,
of his miseries, of his state and life, and the like Adjuncts of his common and
undivided Nature, but chiefly in regard of the knowledge concerning the
SYMPATHIES AND CONCORDANCES BETVVEENE THE MIND AND BODY, which being mixed,
cannot be properly assigned to the sciences of either.

This knowledge has two branches; for as all leagues and Amities consist of
mutual Intelligence, and mutual Offices So this league of mind and body, has
these two parts, How the one discloseth the other, and how the one works upon
the other. Discovery, and Impression. The former of these has begotten two
Arts, both of Predictio^ or Prenotion where of the one is honored with the
inquiry of Aristotle, and the other of Hippocrates. And although they have of
later time been used to be coupled with superstitious and fantastical arts;
yet being purged and restored to their true state; they have both of them a
solid ground in nature, and a profitable use in life. The first is
PHYSIOGNOMIE, which discovers the disposition of the mind, by the Lyneaments
of the body. The second is the EXPOSITION OF NATVRALL DREAMS, which
discovers the state of the body, by the imaginations of the mind. In the
former of these, I note a deficience. For Aristotle has very ingeniously, and
diligently handled the factures of the body, but not the gestures of the
body; which are no less comprehensible by art, and of greater use, and
advantage. For the Lyneaments of the body do disclose the disposition and
inclination of the mind in general; but the Motions of the countenance and
parts, do not only so, but do further disclose the present humor and state
of the mind and will. For as your Majesty says most aptly and elegantly; As
the Tongue speaks to the Ear, so the gesture speaks to the Eye. And
therefore a number of subtle persons, whose eyes do dwell upon the faces and
fashions of men; do well know the advantage of this observation; as being most
part of their ability; neither can it be denied, but that it is a great
discovery of dissimulations, and a great direction in Business.

The later Branch, touching IMPRESSION has not been collected into Art; but
has been handled dispersedly; and it has the same relation or Antistrophe,
that the former has, For the consideration is double, EITHER HOW, AND HOW
FAR THE HVMOVRS AND A^FCTS OF THE BODY, DO ALTER OR WORK UPON THE MIND; or
again, HOW AND HOW FAR THE PASSIONS, OR APPREHENSIONS OF THE MIND, DO
ALTER OR WORK UPON THE BODY. The former of these, has been enquired and
considered, as a part, and appendix of Medicine, but much more as a part of
Religion or superstition. For the Physician prescribes Cures of the mind in
Phrensies, and melancholy passions; and pretends also to exhibit Medicines
to exhilarate the mind, to confirm the courage, to clarify the wits, to
corroborate the memory, and the like; but the scruples and superstitions of
Diet, and other Regiment of the body in the sect of the Pythagoreans, in the
Heresy of the Manicheas, and in the Law of Mahumet do exceed; So likewise
the ordinances in the Ceremonial Law, interdicting the eating of the blood,
and the fat; distinguishing between beasts clean and unclean for meat; are
many and strict. Nay, the faith it self, being clear and serene from all
clouds of Ceremony, yet retains the use of sastings, abstinences, and other
Macerations and humiliations of the body, as things real, and not figurative.
The root and life of all which prescripts, is (besides the Ceremony,) the
consideration of that dependancie, which the affections of the mind are
submitted unto, upon the state and disposition of the body. And if any man of
weak judgment do conceive, that this suffering of the mind from the body,
does either question the Immortality, or derogate from the sovereignty of the
soul: he may be taught in easy instances, that the Infant in the mothers
womb, is compatible with the mother, and yet separable: And the most absolute
Monarch is sometimes led by his servants, and yet without subjection As for
the reciprocal knowledge, which is the operation of the conceits and passions
of the mind upon the body; We see all wise Physicians in the prescriptions
of their regiments to their Patients, do ever consider Accidentia animi: as of
great force to further or hinder remedies, or recoueries; and more specially it
is an inquiry of great depth and worth, concerning IMAGINATION, how, and how
far it alters the body proper of the Imaginant. For although it has a
manifest power to hurt, it follows not, it has the same degree of power to
help. No more than a man can conclude, that because there be pestilent Airs,
able suddenly to kill a man in health; therefore there should be sovereign
airs, able suddenly to cure a man in sickness. But the inquisition of this
part is of great use, though it needs, as Socrates said, A Delian diuer,
being difficult and profound. But unto all this knowledge DE COMMVNI VINCVLO,
of the Concordances between the Mind and the body: that part of Inquiry is
most necessary, which considers of the Seats, and Domiciles which the
several faculties of the mind, do take and occupate in the Organs of the
body, which knowledge has been attempted, and is controuerted, and deserves
to be much better inquired. For the opinion of Plato, who placed the
Understanding in the Brain; Animositie, (which he did unfitly call Anger,
having a greater mixture with Pride) in the Heart; and Concupiseence or
Sensuality in the Liver, deserves not to be despised, but much less to be
allowed. So then we have constituted (as in our own wish and advise) the
inquiry TOUCHING HVMANE NATVRE ENTYER; as a just portion of knowledge, to be
handled apart.

The knowledge that concerns man's body, is divided as the good of man's body
is divided, unto which it refers. The good of man's body, is of four kinds;
Health, Beauty, Strength, and Pleasure. So, the knowledges are Medicine, or
Art of Cure: Art of Decoration; which is called Cosmetike: Art of Actiuitie,
which is called Athletike: and Art Voluptuarie, which Tacitus truly calls
Eruditus Luxus. This Subject of man's body, is of all other things in Nature,
most susceptible of remedy: but then that Remedy is most susceptible of
error. For the same Subtilitie of the subject, does cause large possibility,
and easy failing: and therefore the inquiry ought to be the more exact.

To speak therefore of Medicine, and to resume that we have said, ascending a
little higher; The ancient opinion that Man was Microcosmus, an Abstract or
Model of the world, has been fantastically streyned by Paracelsus, and the
Alchimists, as if there were to be found in man's body certain correspondences,
and parallells, which should have respect to all varieties of things, as
stars, planets, minerals, which are extant in the great world. But thus much
is evidently true, that of all substances, which Nature has produced, man's
body is the most extremely compounded. For we see herbs and plants are
norished by earth and waer; Beasts for the most part, by herbs and fruits; Man
by the flesh of Beasts, Birds, Fishes, Herbs, Grains, Fruits, Water, and the
manifold alterations, dressings, and preparations of these several bodies,
before they come to be his food and aliment. Add hereunto that Beasts have a
more simple order of life, and less change of Affections to work upon their
bodies, whereas man in his Mansion, sleep, exercise, passions, has infinite
variations; and it cannot be denied, but that the body of Man of all other
things, is of the most compounded Mass. The soul on the other side is the
simplest of substances, as is well expressed.

Purumque reliquit
Aethereum sensum, atque Aurai simplicis ignem.
So that it is no marvel, though the soul so placed, enjoy no rest, if that
principle be true, that Motus rerum est rapidus extra locum, Placidus in loco.
But to the purpose, this variable composition of man's body has made it as an
Instrument easy to to distemper; and therefore the Poets did well to conioyne
MUSIC and MEDICINE in Apollo, because the Office of Medicine, is but to tune
this curious Harp of man's body, and to reduce it to Harmony. So then the
Subject being so Variable, has made the Art by consequent more coniecturall,
and the Art being Coniecturall, has made so much the more place to be left
for imposture. For almost all other Arts and Sciences, judged by Acts, or
Master pieces, as I may term them, and not by the successes, and events. The
Lawyer is judged by the virtue of his pleading, and not by the issue of the
cause: The Master in the Ship, is judged by the directing his course aright,
and not by the fortune of the Voyage: But the Physician, and perhaps the
Politic, has no particular Acts demonstratiue of his ability, but is judged
most by the event: which is ever but as it is taken; for who can tell if a
Patient die or recover, or if a State be preserved, or ruyned, whether it be
Art or Accident? And therefore many times the Impostor is prized, and the man
of virtue taxed. Nay, we see weakness and credulity of men, is such, as they
will often prefer a Montabanke or Witch, before a learned Physician. And
therefore the Poets were clear sighted in discerning this extreme folly, when
they made Aesculapius, and Circe, Brother and Sister, both Children of the
Sun, as in the verses.

Ipse repertorem medicinae talis and artis,
Fulmine Phoebigenam stygias detrusit ad vn^as,
And again.

Dives inaccessos vbi Solis filia Lucos, etc.
For in all times in the opinion of the multitude, Witches, and old women, and
Impostors have had a Competicion with Physicians. And what follows? Even this
that Physicians say to themselves, as Solomon expresses it upon an higher
occasion: If it befall to me, as befalls to the fools, why should I labor
to be more wise? And therefore I cannot much blame Physicians, that they use
commonly to intend some other Art or practice, which they fancy, more than
their profession. For you shall have of them: Antiquaries, Poets, Humanists,
Statesmen, Merchants, Divines, and in every of these better seen, than in
their profession, and no doubt, upon this ground that they find, that
mediocrity and excellency in their Art, makes no difference in profit or
reputation toward their fortune: for the weakness of Patients, and
sweetness of life, and Nature of hope makes men depend upon Physicians, with
all their defects. But nevertheless, these things which we have spoken of, are
courses begotten between a little occasion, and a great deal of sloth and
default: for if we will excite and awake our observation, we shall see in
familiar instances, what a predominant faculty, The Subtlety of Spirit, has
over the Variety of Matter, or Form: Nothing more variable then faces and
countenances: yet men can bea^e in memory the infinite distinctions of them.
Nay, a Painter with a few shelles of colors, and the benefit of his Eye, and
habit of his imagination can imitate them all that ever have been, ar, or may
be, if they were brought before him. Nothing more variable than voices, yet men
can likewise discern them personally, nay you shall have a Buffon, or
Pantomimus will express as many as he pleases. Nothing more variable, than
the differing sounds of words, yet men have found the way to reduce the^ to a
few simple Letters; so that it is not the insufficiency or incapacity of man's
mind; but it is the remove standing or placing thereof, that breeds these
Mazes and incomprehensions; for as the sense a far off, is full of mistaking,
but is exact at hand, so is it of the understanding; The remedy whereof, is
not to quicken or strengthen the Organ, but to go nearer to the object; and
therefore there is no doubt, but if the Physicians will learn, and use the
true approaches and Auenues of Nature, they may assume as much as the Poet
says;

Et quoniam variant Morbi, variabimus arts,
Mill Mali species, mill Salutis erunt.
Which that they should do, the nobleness of their Art does deserve; well
shadowed by the Poets, in that they made Aesculapius to be the son of Sun,
the one being the fountain of life, the other as the second stream; but
infinitely more honored by the example of our Savior, who made the body of man
the object of his miracles, as the soul was the object of his Doctrine. For
we read not that ever he vouchsafed to do any miracle about honor, or money,
(except that one for giving Tribute to Caesar) but only about the preserving,
sustayning, and healing the body of man.

Medicine is a Science, which has been (as we have said) more professed,
than labored, and yet more labored, than advanced; the labor having been, in my
judgment, rather in circle, than in progression. For, I find much Iteration,
but small Addition. It considers causes of Diseases, with the occasions or
impulsions: The Discases themselves, with the Accidents: and the Cures, with
the Preseruations. The Deficiences which I think good to note, being a few of
many, and those such, as ar of a more open and manifest Nature, I will
enumerate, and not place.

The first is the discontinuance of the ancient and serious diligence of
Hippocrates, which used to Narrationes Medicinales.
set down a Narratiue of the special cases of his patientes, and how they
proceeded, and how they were judged by recovery or death. Therefore having an
example proper in the father of the art, I shall not need to allege an example
foreign, of the wisdom of the Lawyers, who are careful to report new cases
and decisions, for the direction of future judgments. This continuance of
Medicinal History, I find deficient, which I understand neither to be so
infinite as to extend to every common Case, nor so reserved, as to admit none
but Woonders: for many things are new in the Manner, which are not new in the
Kind, and if men will intend to observe, they shall find much worthy to
observe.

In the inquiry which is made by Anatomy, I find Anatomia comparata.
much deficience: for they enquire of the Parts, and their Substances, Figures,
and Collocations; But they enquire not of the Diversities of the Parts; the
Secrecies of the Passages; and the seats or neastling of the humors; nor much
of the Footsteps, and impressions of Diseases; The reason of which omission, I
suppose to be, because the first inquiry may be satisfied, in the view of one
or a few Anatomies: but the latter being comparatiue and casual, must arise
from the view of many. And as to the diversity of parts, there is no doubt but
the facture or framing of the inward parts, is as full of difference, as the
outward, and in that, is the Cause Continent of many diseases, which not being
observed, they quarrel many times with the humors which are not in fault, the
fault being in the very frame and Mechanicke of the part, which cannot be
removed by medicine alteratine, but must be accomodate and palliate by dyets
and medicines familiar. And for the passages and pores, it is true which was
aunciently noted, that the more subtle of them appear not in anatomyes,
because they are shut and latent in dead bodies, though they be open and
manifest in live: which being supposed, though the inhumanity of Anatomia
viuoru^ was by Celsus just ly reproved: yet in regard of the great use of this
observation, the inquiry needed not by him so slightly to have been
relinquished altogether, or referred to the casual practices of surgerie, but
might have been well diuerted upon the dissection of beasts alive, which
notwithstanding the dissimilitude of their parts, may sufficiently satisfy
this inquiry. And for the humors, they are commonly passed over in Anatomies,
as purgaments, whereas it is most necessary to observe, what cauities, nestes
and receptacles the humors do find in the parts, with the differing kind of
the humor so lodged and received. And as for the footesteps of diseases, and
their deuas^ations of the inward parts, impostumations, exulcerations,
discontinuations, putrefactions, consumptions, contractions, extensions,
convulsions, dislocations, obstructions, repletions, together with all
preternatural substances, as stones, carnosities, excrescences, worms, and the
like: they ought to have been exactly observed by multitude of Anatomies, and
the contribution of men's several experiences; and carefully set down both
historically according to the appearances, and artificially with a reference to
the diseases and symptoms which resulted from them, in case where the Anatomy
is of a desunct patient whereas now upon opening of bodies, they are passed over
slightly, and in silence.

In the inquiry of diseases, they do abandon the cures of many, some as in
their nature incurable, Inquisitio vlterior de Morbis insanabisibus.
and others, as passed the periode of cure; so that Sylla and the Triumvirs
never proscribed so many men to die, as they do by their ignorant edictes,
whereof numbers do escape with less difficulty, then they did in the Roman
proscriptions. Therefore I will not doubt, to note as a deficience, that they
inquire not the persite cures of many diseases, or extremities of diseases, but
pronouncing them incurable, do enact a law of neglect, and exempt ignorance
from discredit.

Nay further, I esteem it the office of a Physician, De Euthanasia exteriore.
not only to restore health, but to mittigate pain and dolors, and not only
when such mittigation may conduce to recovery, but when it may serve to make a
fair and easy passage: for it is no small felicity which Auguslus Caesar was
wont to wish to himself, that same Euthanasia, and which was specially noted
in the death of Antoninus Pius, whose death was after the fashion and semblance
of a kindly and pleasant sleep. So it is written of Epicurus, that after his
disease was judged desperate, he drowned his stomach and senses with a large
draught and ingurgitation of wine, whereupon the Epigram was made; Hinc stygias
Ebrius hausit aquas: He was not sober enough to taste any bitterness of the
stygian water. But the Physicians contrariwise do make a kind of scruple and
Religion to stay with the patient after the disease is deplored, whereas, in my
judgment they ought both to enquire the skill, and to give the attendances for
the facilitating and asswaging of the pains and agonies of death.

In the consideration of the Cures of diseases, I find a deficience in the
Receiptes of propriety, respecting Medicinae experimentales.
the particular cures of diseases: for the Physicians have frustrated the
fruit of tradition and experience by their magistralities, in adding and
taking out and changing, Quid pro quo, in their receiptes, at their pleasures,
commanding so over the medicine, as the medicine cannot commma^d over the
disease: For except it be Treacle and Mythridatu^, and of late Diascordium, and
a few more, they tie themselves to no receiptes severely and religiously: for
as to the confections of sale, which are in the shoppes, they are for readiness,
and not for propriety: for they are upon general intentions of purging,
opening, comforting, altering, and not much appropriate to, particular
Diseases; and this is the cause why Emperiques, and old women are more happy
many times in their Cures, than learned Physicians; because they are more
religious in holding their Medicines. Therefore here is the deficience which I
find, that Physicians have not partly out of their own practice, partly out
of the constant probations reported in books; and partly out of the traditions
of Emperiques; setdowne and delivered over, certain Experimental Medicines,
for the Cure of particular Diseases; besides their own Coniecturall and
Magistrall descriptions. For as they were the men of the best Composition in
the State of Rome, which either being Consuls inclined to the people; or being
Tribunes inclined to the Senate: so in the matter we now handle, they be the
best Physicians, which being learned incline to the traditions of experience;
or being Imitatio Naturae in Balneis, and Aquis Medicinalibus
Emperiques, incline to the methods of learning.

In preparation of Medicines, I do find strange specially, considering how
mineral Medicines have been extolled; and that they are safer, for the
outward, than inward parts, that no man has sought, to make an Imitation by
Art of Natural Bathes, and Medicinable fountains: which nevertheless are
confessed to receive their virtues from Minerals: and not so only, but
discerned and distinguished from what particular Mynerall they receive
Tincture, as Sulphur, Vitriole, steel, or the like: which Nature if it may be
reduced to compositions of art, both the variety of them will be increased,
and the temper of them will be more commanded.

But least I grow to be more particular, than is agreeable, Filum Medicinale,
sieve de vicibus Medicinarum.
either to my intention, or to proportion; I will conclude this part with the
note of one deficience more, which seems to me of greatest consequence, which
is, that the prescripts in use, are too compendious to attain their end: for
to my understanding, it is a vain and flattering opinion, to think any
Medicine can be so sovereign, or so happy, as that the Receipt or use of it,
can work any great effect upon the body of man; it were a strange speech,
which spoken, or spoken often, should reclaim a man from a vice, to which he
were by nature subject: it is order, poursuite, sequence, and interchange of
application, which is mighty in nature; which although it require more exact
knowledge in prescribing, and more precise obedience in observing, yet is
recompensed with the magnitude of effects. And although a man would think by
the daily visitations of the Physicians, that there were a poursuance in the
cure; yet let a man look into their prescripts and ministrations, and he shall
find them but inconstancies, and every days devises, without any settled
providence or project; Not that every scrupulous or superstitious prescript is
effectual, no more than every straight way, is the way to heaven, but the
truth of the direction, must precede s^ueritie of observance.

For Cosmetique, it has parts Civil, and parts Effeminate: for cleanesse of
body, was ever esteemed to proceed from a due reverence to God, to society,
and to our selves. As for artificial decoration, it is well worthy of the
desiciences which it has: being neither fine enough to deceive, nor handsome
to use, nor wholesome to please.

For Athletique, I take the subject of it largely; that is to say, for any
point of ability, whereunto the body of man may be brought, whether it be of
Actiuitie, or of Patience, whereof Actiuitie has two parts, Strength and
Swifinesse: And Patience likewise has two parts, Hardness against wants and
extremities; and Indurance of pain, or torment; whereof we see the practices
in Tumblers, in Savages, and in those that suffer punishment: Nay, if there be
any other faculty, which falls not within any of the former divisions, as in
those that diue, that obtain a strange power of containing respiration, and
the like, I refer it to this part. Of these things the practices are known:
but the Philosophy that concerns them is not much enquired: the rather I
think, because they are supposed to be obtained, either by an aptness of
Nature, which cannot be taught; or only by continual custom; which is soon
prescribed; which though it be not true: yet I forbear to note any
deficiences: for the Olympian Games are down long since: and the mediocritie
of these things is for use: As for the excellency of them, it serves for the
most part, but for mercenary ostentation.

For Arts of pleasure sensual, the chief deficience in them, is of Laws to
repress them. For as it has been well observed, that the Arts which flourish
in times, while virtue is in growth, are Military: and while virtue is in
State are Liberal: and while virtue is in declination, are voluptuarie: so I
doubt, that this age of the world, is somewhat upon the descent of the wheel;
with Arts voluptuarie, I couple practices Iocularie; for the deceiving of the
senses, is one of the pleasures of the senses. As for Games of recreation, I
hold them to belong to Civil life, and education. And thus much of that
particular HVMANE PHILOSOPHY, WHICH CONCERNS THE BODY, which is but the
Tabernacle of the mind.

FOr HVMANE KNOWLEDGE, WHICH CONCERNS THE MIND, it has two parts, the one
that enquireth of THE SVBSTANCE, OR NATVRE OF THE SOVLE OR MIND; The other,
that enquireth of the FACVLTIES OR FVNCTIONS THEREOF: unto the first of these,
the considerations of the Original of the soul, whether it be Native or
aduentiue; and how far it is exempted from Laws of Matter; and of the
Immortality thereof; and many other points do appertain, which have been not
more laboriously enquired, than variously reported; so as the travail therein
taken, seems to have been rather in a Maze, than in a way. But although I am
of opinion, that this knowledge may be more really and soundly enquired even in
Nature, than it has been; yet I hold, that in the end it must be bounded by
Religion; or else it will be subject to deceit and delusion: for as the
substance of the soul in the Creation, was not extracted out of the Mass of
heaven and earth, by the benediction of a Producat: but was immediately
inspired from God; so it is not possible that it should be (otherwise than by
accident) subject to the Laws of Heaven and Earth; which are the subject of
Philosophy; And therefore the true knowledge of the Nature, and state of the
soul, must come by the same inspiration, that gave the substance. Unto this
part of knowledge touching the soul, there be two appendices, which as they
have been handled, have rather vapoured forth fables, than kindled truth;
DIVINATION, and FASCINATION.

DIVINATION, has been anciently and fitly divided into Artificial and
Natural; whereof Artificial is, when the mind makes a prediction by
argument, concluding upon signs and tokens: Naturallis, when the mind has a
presention by an internal power, without the inducement of a sign.
Artifi^iall is of two sorts, either when the argument is coupled with a
deriuation of causes, which is rational; or when it is only grounded upon a
Coincidence of the effect, which is experimental; whereof the later for the
most part, is superstitious: Such as were the Heathen observations, upon the
inspection of Sacrifices, the flights of birds, the swarming of Bees; and such
as was the Chaldean Astrology, and the like. For Artificall Divination, the
several kinds thereof are distributed amongst particular knowledges. The
Astronomer has his predictions, as of conjunctions, aspects, Eclipses, and the
like. The Physician has his predictions, of death, of recovery, of the
accidents and issues of Diseases. The Politic has his predictions; O vrbem
vaenalem, and cito perituram, si emptorem inucnerit; which stayed not long to
be performed in Sylla first, and after in Caesar. So as these predictions are
now impertine^t, and to be referred over. But the Divination, which springs
from the internal nature of the soul, is that which we now speak of which has been made to be of two sorts; Primitive and by influxion. Primitive is grounded
upon the supposition, that the mind when it is withdrawn and collected into
it self, and not diffused into the Organes of the body, has some extent and
latitude of prenotion; which therefore appears most in sleep, in ecstasies,
and nere death; and more rarely in waking apprehensions; and is induced and
furthered by those abstinences, and obseruances, which make the mind most to
consist in it self. By influxion; is grounded upon the conceit, that the mind,
as a mirror or glass, should take illumination from the fore knowledge of God
and spirits, unto which the same Regiment does likewise conduce. For the
retyring of the mind within it self, is the State which is most susceptible
of divine influxions; save that it is accompanied in this case with a feruencie
and elevation, (which the ancients noted by fury) and not with a repose and
and quiet, as it is in the other.

Fascination is the power and act of Imagination, intensiue upon other bodies,
than the body of the Imaginant; for of that we spoke in the proper place:
wherein the School of Paracelsus, and the Disciples of pretended Natural
Magic, have been so intemperate, as they have exalted the power of the
imagination, to be much one with the power of Miracle-working faith: others
that draw nearer to Probability, calling to their view the secret passages of
things, and specially of the Contagion that passes from body to body, do
conceive it should likewise be agreeable to Nature, that there should be some
transmissions and operations from spirit to spirit, without the mediation of
the senses, whence the conceits have grown, (now almost made civil) of the
Maistring Spirit, and the force of confidence, and the like. Incident unto
this, is the inquiry how to raise and fortify the imagination, for if the
Imagination fortified have power, then it is material to know how to fortify
and exalt it. And herein comes in crookedly and dangerously, a palliation of a
great part of Ceremonial Magic. For it may be pretended, that Ceremonies,
Characters, and Charms do work, not by any Tacit or Sacramentali contract
with evil spirits; but serve only to strengthen the imagination of him that
uses it; as Images are said by the Roman Church, to fix the cogitations, and
raise the devotions of them that pray before them. But for mine own judgment,
if it be admitted that Imagination has power; and that Ceremontes fortify
Imagination, and that they be used sincerely and intentionally for that
purpose: yet I should hold them unlawful, as opposing to that first edict,
which God gave unto man. In sudore vultus comedes Panem tuum. For they propound
those noble effects which God has set forth unto man, to be bought at the
price of Labor, to be attained by a few easy and slothful obseruances.
Deficiences in these knowledges I will report none, other than the general
deficience, that it is not known, how much of them is verity, and how much
vanity.

THE KNOVVLIDGE WHICH RESPECTS THE FACVLTIES OF THE MIND OF MAN, is of two
kinds: The one respecting his UNDERSTANDING and REASON, and the other his WILL,
APPETITE, and AFFECTION, whereof the former produces POSITION or DECREE, the
later ACTION or EXECVTION. It is true that the Imagination is an Agent, or
Nuntius in both Provinces, both the Judicial, and the Ministerial. For Sense
sends over to Imagination, before Reason have judged: and Reason sends over
to Imagination, before the Decree can be acted. For Imagination ever precedeth
Voluntary Motion. Saving that this Ianus of Imagination has differing faces;
for the face toward Reason, has the print of Truth. But the face toward
Action, has the print of Good; which nevertheless are faces,

Quales decet esse sororum. Neither is the Imagination simply and only a
Messenger; but is invested with, or at least wise usurps (...) no small
authority in it self; besides the duty of the Message. For it was well said
by Aristotle: That the mind has over the Body that commandment which the
Lord has over a Bondman; But, that Reason has over the Imagination that
Commandment, which a Magistrate hoth over a free Citizen; who may come also to
rule in his turn. For we see, that in matters of Faith and Religion, we raise
our Imagination above our Reason, which is the cause why Religion sought ever
access to the Mind by Similitudes, Types, Parables, Visions, Dreams. And
again in all persuasions that are wrought by eloquence, and other impression
of like Nature, which do paint and disguise the true appearance of things,
the chief recommendation unto Reason, is from the Imagination. Nevertheless,
because I find not any Science, that does properly or fitly pertain to the.
IMAGINATION, I see no cause to alter the former division. For as for Poelie, it
is rather a pleasure, or play of imagination, than a work or duty thereof.
And if it be a work; we speak not now of such parts of learning, as the
Imagination produces, but of such Sciences, as handle and consider of the
Imagination. No more than we shall speak now of such Knowledges, as reason
produces, (for that extends to all Philosophy) but of such Knowledges, as
do handle and enquire of the faculty of Reason; So as Poesy had his true
place. As for the power of the Imagination in nature, and the manner of
fortifying the same, we have mentioned it in the Doctrine De Anima, whereunto
most fitly it belongs. And lastly, for Imaginatiue, or Insinuatiue Reason,
which is the subject of Rhetericke, we think it best to refer it to the
Arts of Reason. So therefore we content our selves with the former division,
that Humane Philosophy, which respects the faculties of the mind of man,
has two parts, RATIONAL and MORAL.

The part of humane Philosophy, which is Rational, is of all knowledges to
the most wits the least delightful: and seems but a Net of subtilitie and
spinositie. For as it was truly said, that Knowledge is Pabulumanimi; So in
the Nature of men's appetite to this food, most men are of the taste and stomach
of the Israelites in the desert, that would feign have returned Adollas
carnium, and were weary of Manna, which though it were celestial, yet seemed
less nutritive and comfortable. So generally men taste well knowledges that are
drenched in flesh and blood, C^ile History, Mora^litie, Policy, about the
which men's affections, praises, fortunes do turn and are conversant: But this
same Lumensiccum, does parch and offend most men's watery and soft natures. But
to speak truly of things as they are in worth, RATIONAL Knowledges; are the
keys of all other Arts; For as Aristotle says aptly and elegantly, That the
hand is the Instrument of Instruments; and the mind is the Form of Fourmes:
So these be truly said to be the Art of Arts: Neither do they only direct,
but likewise confirm and strengthen: even as the habit of shooting, does not
only enable to shoot a nearer shoot, but also to draw a stronger Bow.

The ARTS INTELLECTVALL, are four in number, divided according to the ends
whereunto they are referred: for man's labor is to invent that which is sought
or propounded: or to judge that which is invented: or to retain that which is
judged: or to deliver over that which is retained. So as the Arts must be
four: ART of ENQVIRIE or INVENTION: ART of EXAMINATION or IVDGEMENT: ART of
CVSTODIE or MEMORY: and ART of ELOCVTION or TRADITION.

INVENTION is of two kinds much differing; The one of ARTS and SCIENCES, and
the other of SPEECH and ARGVMENTS. The former of these, I do report deficient:
which seems to me to be such a deficience, as if in the making of an
Inventory, touching the State of a defunct, it should be set down, That there
is no ready money. For as money will fetch all other commodities; so this
knowledge is that which should purchase all the rest. And like as the West
Indies had never been discovered, if the use of the Mariners Needle, had not
been first discovered; though the one be vast Regions, and the other a small
Motion. So it cannot be found strange, if Sciences be no further discov^ered,
if the Art it self of Invention and Discovery, has been passed over.

That this part of Knowledge is wanting, to my Judgment, stands plainly
confessed: for first Logic does not pretend to invent Sciences, or the
Axioms of Sciences, but passes it over with a Cuique in sua art credendum.
And Celsus acknowledges it gravely, speaking of the Empirical and Dogmaticall
Sects of Physicians, That Medicines and Cures, were first found out, and then
after the Reasons and causes were discoursed: and not the Causes first found
out, and by light from them the Medicines and Cures discovered. And Plato in
his Theoetetus notes well, That particulars are infinite, and the higher
generalities give no safficient direction: and that the pythe of all Sciences,
which makes the Arts-man differ from the inexpert, is in the middle
propositions, which in every particular knowledge are taken from Tradition and
Experience. And therefore we see, that they which discourse of the Inventions
and Originals of things, refer them rather to Chance, than to Art, and
rather to Beasts, Birds, Fishes, Serpents, than to Men.

Purpureo: non illa feris incognita Capris,
Gramina cum tergo volueres haesere (...).
So that it was no marvel, (the manner of Antiquity being to consecrate
Inuentors) that the Egyptians had so few humane Idols in their Temples, but
almost all Brute:

Omnige^umqne Deum monstra, and latrator A^bis
Contra Neptunu^ and Venerem, contraque Mineruam etc.
And if you like better the tradition of the Grecians, and ascribe the first
Inventions to Men, yet you will rather believe that Prometheus first stroke
the flints, and maruailed at the spark, than that when he first stroke the
flints, he xpected the spark; and therefore we see the West Indian Prometheus,
had no intelligence with the Europoean, because of the rareness with them of
flint, that gave the first occasion: so as it should seem, that hitherto men
are rather beholden to a wild Goat for Surgerie, or to a Nightingale for
Music or to the Ibis for some part of Physic, or to the Pot-lidde, that
flew open for Artillery, or generally to Chance, or any thing else, than to
Logic for the Invention of Arts and Sciences. Neither is the form of
Invention, which Virgill describes much other.

Vt varias vsus medit ando extunderet arts,
Paulatim,
For if you observe the words well, it is no other method, than that which
brute Beasts are capable of, and do put in ure; which is a perpetual
intending or practicing some one thing urged and imposed, by an absolute
necessity of conservation of being; For so Ci^ says very truly; Vsus vni rei
deditus, and Naturam and Artem sape vincit: And therefore if it be said of Men,

Labor omnia vincit
Improbus, and duris vrgens in rebus egestas;
It is likewise said of beasts, Quis Ps^taco do^uit suum (...)? who taught the
Raven in a drowth to throw pibbles into an hollow tree, where she spyed water,
that the water might rise, so as she might come to it? who taught the Be to
sail through such a vast Sea of air, and to find the way from a field in
flower, a great way off, to her Hiue? who taught the Ant to bite every grain
of Corn, that she burieth in her hill, least it should take root and grow?
Add then the word Extandere, which imports the extreme difficulty, and the
word Paulatin, which imports the extreme slownesse; and we are where we
were, even amongst the Egyptians Gods; there being little left to the faculty
of Reason, and nothing to the duty of Art for matter of Invention.

Secondly, the Induction which the Logitians speak of and which seems
familiar with Plato, whereby the Principles of Sciences may be pretended to be
invented, and so the middle propositions by deriuation from the Principles;
their form of Induction, I say is utterly vicious and incompetent: wherein
their erroar is the fowler because it is the duty of Art to perfect and
exalt Nature: but they contrariewise have wronged, abused, and traduced Nature.
For he that shall attentively observe how the mind does gather this
excellent dew of Knowledge, like unto that which the Poet speaks of
Aere^mellis caelestia dona, destilling and contryuing it out of particulars
natural and artificial, as the flowers of the field and Garden: shall find
that the mind of her self by Nature does manage, and Act an Induction, much
better than they describe it. For to conclude upon an Enu^meration of
particulars, without instance contradictorie: is no conclusion: but a
conjecture; for who can assure (in many subjects) upon those particulars,
which appear of a side, that there are not other on the contrary side, which
appear not? As if Samuel should have rested upon those Sonn^s of Issay,
which were brought before him, and failed of David, which was in the field. And
this form (to say truth) is so gross: as it had not been possible for
wits so subti'e, as have managed these things, to have offered it to the
world, but that they hasted to their Theories and Dogmaticals, and were
imperious and scornful toward particulars, which their manner was to use, but
as Lictores and Via^ores for Sargeants and Wifflers, Ad summouendam tu^bam, to
make way and make room for their opinions, rather than in their true use and
service; certainly, it is a thing may touch a man with a religious wonder, to
see how the foot steps of seducement, are the very same in Divine and Humane
truth: for as in Divine truth, Man cannot endure to become as a Child; So in
Humane, they reputed the attending the Inductions (whereof we speak) as if it
were a second Infancy or Child hood.

Thirdly; allow some Principles or Axioms were rightly induced; yet
nevertheless certain it is, that Middle Propositions, cannot be diduced from
them in Subject of Nature by Syllogism, that is, by Touch, and Reduction of
them to Principles in a Middle Term. It is true, that in Sciences popular, as
Moralities, Laws, and the like, yea, and Divinity (because it pleases God to
apply himself to the capacity of the simplest) that form may have use; and
in Natural Philosophy likewise, by way of argument or satisfactorie Reason,
Quae assensum parit, Operis Effoeta est: But the subtlety of Nature and
Operations will not be inchayned in those bonds: For Arguments consist of
Propositions, and Propositions of Words, and Words are but the Current Tokens
or Marks of popular Notions of things: which Notions if they be grossly and
variably collected out of Particulars; It is not the laborious examination
either of Consequences of Arguments,, or of the truth of Propositions, that can
ever correct that Error; being (as the Physicians speak) in the first
digestion; And therefore it was not without cause, that so many excellent
Philosophers became Sceptiques and Academiques, and denied any certainty of
Knowledge, or Comprehension, and held opinion that the knowledge of man
extended only to Appearances, and Probabilities. It is true, that in Socrates
it was supposed to be but a form of Irony, Scientiam dissimulando simulauit:
For he used to disable his knowledge, to the end to inhanse his Knowledge,
like the Humor of ^iberius in his beginnings, that would Reign, but would not
acknowledge so much; And in the later Academy, which Cicero embraced; this
opinion also of Acatalepsia (I doubt) was not held sincerely; for that all
those which excelled in Copy of speech, seem to have chosen that Sect, as
that which was fittest to give glory to their eloquence, and variable
discourses: being rather like Progresses of pleasure, than Iourneyes to an end.
But assuredly many scattered in both Academyes, did hold it in subtlety, and
integrity. But here was their chief ^rrour; They charged the deceit upon
the THE SENSES; which in my Judgment (notwithstanding all their Cauillations)
are very sufficient to certify and report truth (though not always
immediately, yet by comparison; by help of instrument; and by producing, and
urging such things, as are too subtle for the sense, to some effect
comprehensible, by the sense, and other like assistance. But they ought to have
charged the deceit upon the weakness of the intellectual powers, and upon the
manner of collecting, and concluding upon the reports of the senses. This I
speak not to disable the mind of man, but to stir it up to seek help: for
no man, be he never so cunning or practiced, can make a straight line or
perfect circle by steadiness of hand, which may be easily done by help of a
Ruler or Compass.

This part of Invention, concerning the Invention of Sciences, I purpose (if
God give me leave) Experientia literata, and interpretatio Naturae.
hereafter to propound: having digested it into two parts: whereof the one I
term Experientia literata, and the other Interpretatio Naturae: The former,
being but a degree and rudiment of the later. But I will not dwell too long,
nor speak too great upon a promise.

The Invention of speech or argument is not properly an Invention: for to
Invent is to discover that we know not, and not to recover or resu^mon that
which we already know; and the use of this Invention, is no other; But out
of the Knowledge, whereof our mind is already possessed, to draw forth, or
call before us that which may be pertinent to the purpose, which we take into
our consideration. So as to speak truly, it is no Invention; but a
Remembrance or Suggestion, with a Application: Which is the cause why the
Schools do place it after Judgment, as subsequent and not precedent.
Nevertheless, because we do account it a Chase, as well of Dear in an
enclosed Park, as in a Forest at large: and that it has already obtained
the the name: Let it be called Invention; so as it be perceived and discerned,
that the Scope and end of this Invention, is readynesse and present use of our
knowledge, and not addition or amplification thereof.

To procure this ready use of Knowledge, there are two Courses: PREPARATION
and SVGGESTION. The former of these, seems scarcely a part of Knowledge;
consisting rather of Diligence, than of any artificial erudition And herein
Aristotle wittily, but hurtfully does deride the Sophists, near his time,
saying. They did as if one that professed the Art of Shooe-making, should not
teach how to make up a Shoe, but only exhibit in a readin^sse a number of
Shoes of all fashions and Sizes. But yet a man might reply, that if a
Shooemaker should have no Shoes in his Shop, but only work, as he is
bespoken, he should be weakly customed. But our Savior, speaking of Divine
Knowledge, says: That the Kingdom of Heaven, is like a good Ho^sholder, that
brings foo^th both n^we and old store: And we see the ancient Writers of
Rhetoric do give it in precept: That Pleaders should have the Places,
whereof they have most continual use, ready handled in all the variety that
may be, as that, To speak for the literal Interpretation of the Law against
Equity, and Contrary: and to speak for Presumptions and Inferences against
Testimony; and Contrary: And Cicero himself, being broken unto it by great
experience, delivers it plainly; That whatsoever a man shall have occasion
to speak of, (if he will take the pains) he may have it in effect
premeditate, and handled in these. So that when he comes to a particular, he
shall have nothing to do, but to put too Names, and times, and places; and
such other Circumstances of Indiuiduals. We see likewise the exact diligence of
Demosthenes, who in regard of the great force, that the entrance and access
into causes has to make a good impression; had ready framed a number of
Prefaces for Orations and Speeches. All which Authorities and Presidents may
over way Aristotle's opinion, that would have us change a rich Wardrobe, for a
pair of Sheares.

But the Nature of the Collection of this Provision or Preparatorie store,
though it be common, both to Logic, and Rhetoric; yet having made an entrye
of it here, where it came first to be spoken of; I think fit to refer
over the further handling of it to Rhetoric.

The other part of INVENTION, which I term SVGGESTION, does assign and direct
us to certain Marks or Places, which may excite our Mind to return and
produce such Knowledge, as it has formerly collected: to the end we may make
use thereof. Neither is this use (truly taken) only to furnish argument, to
dispute probably with others; But likewise to Minister unto our Judgment to
conclude aright within our selves. Neither may these places serve only to
apprompt our Invention; but also to direct our inquiry. For a faculty of wise
interrogating is half a knowledge; For as Plato says; Whosoever seeks,
knows that which he seeks for, in a general Notion; Else how shall he know
it, when he has found it? And therefore the larger your Anticipation is, the
more direct and compendious is your search. But the same Places which will help
us what to produce, of that which we know already; will also help us, if a
man of experience were before us, what questions to ask; or if we have Books
and Authors, to instruct us what points to search and reuolue: so as I cannot
report, that this part of Invention, which is that which the Schools call
Topiques, is deficient.

Nevertheless Topiques are of 2. sorts general and special. The general we
have spoken to; but the particular has been touched by some, but rejected
generally, as inartificial and variable. But leaving the humor which has
reigned too much in the Schools (which is to be vainly subtle in a few
things, which are within their command, and to reject the rest) I do receive
particular Topiques, that is places or directions of Invention and Inquiry in
every particular knowledge, as things of great use; being Mixtures of Logique
with the Matter of Sciences: for in these it holds; Ars inueniendi adolescit
cum Inuentis: for as in going of a way, we do not only gain that part of
the way which is passed, but we gain the better sight of that part of the
way which remains: So every degree of proceeding in a Science gives a
light to that which follows; which light if we strengthen, by drawing it
forth into questions or places inquiry, we do greatly advance our poursuyte.

Now we pass unto the ARTS OF IVDGEMENT, which handle the Natures of
Proofs and Demonstrations; which as to Induction has a Coincidence with
Invention: For all Inductions whether in good or vicious form, the same
action of the Mind which Inuenteth, Judges; all one as in the sense: But
otherwise it is in proof by Syllogism: For the proof being not immediate
but by mean: the Invention of the Mean is one thing: and the Judgment of
the Consequence is another. The one Excyting only: the other Examining:
Therefore for the real and exact form of Judgment, we refer our selves
to that which we have spoken of Interpretation of Nature.

For the other Judgment by Syllogism, as it is a thing most agreeable to the
Mind of Man: So it has been vehementlye and excellently labored. For the
Nature of Man does extreamelye covet, to have somewhat in his Understanding
fixed and immovable, and as a Rest, and Support of the Mind. And therefore as
Aristotle endeavors to prove, that in all Motion, there is some point
quiescent; and as he elegantlye expounds the ancient Fable of Atlas, (that
stood fixed, and bare up the Heaven from falling) to be meant of the Poles or
Axel tree of Heaven, whereupon the conversion is accomplished; so assuredlye
men have a desire, to have an Atlas or Axel tree within: to keep them from
fluctuation; which is like to a perpetual peril of falling: Therefore men did
hasten to set down some Principles, about which the variety of their
disputations might turn.

So then this Art of IVDGEMENT, is but the Reduction of Propositions, to
Principles in a Middle Term. The Principles to be agreed by all, and
exempted from Argument; The MIDDLR TERM to be elected at the liberty of
every Man's Invention: The Reduction to be of two kinds Direct, and Inuerted;
the one when the Proposition is reduced to the Principle, which they term a
Probation ostensiue: the other when the contradictorie of the Proposition is
reduced to the contradictorie of the Principles, which is, that which they call
Per Incommodum, or pressing an absurdity: the Number of Middle Terms to be,
as the Proposition stands, Degrees more or less, removed from the Principle.

But this Art has two several Methodes of Doctrine: the one by way of
Direction, the other by way of Caution: the former frames and sets down a
true Form of Consequence, by the variations and deflexions, from which
Errors and Inconsequences may be exactly judged. Toward the Composition and
structure of which form, it is incident to handle the parts thereof, which
are Propositions, and the parts of Propositions, which are SIMPLE WORDS. And
this is that part of Logic, which is comprehended in the Analytiques.

The second Method of Doctrine, was introduced for expedite use, and assurance
sake; discovering the more subtle fourmes of Sophismes, and Illaqueations,
with their redargutions, which is that which is termed ELENCHES. For although
in the more gross sorts of Fallacies it happens (as Seneca make the
comparison well) as in iugling feats, which though we know not how they are
done; yet we know well it is not, as it seems to be: yet the more subtle
sort of them does not only put a man besides his answer, but does many times
abuse his Judgment.

This part concerning ELENCHES, is excellently handled by Aristotle in Precept,
but more excellently by Plato in Example: not only in the persons of the
Sophists, but even in Socrates himself, who professing to affirm nothing, but
to infirm that which was affirmed by another, has exactly expressed all the
fourmes of objection, fallace and redargution. And although we have said that
the use of this Doctrine is for Redargution: yet it is manifest, the degenerate
and corrupt is use for Caption and Contradiction, which passes for a great
faculty, and no doubt, is of very great advantage; though the difference be
good which was made between Orators and Sophisters, that the one is as the
Greyhound, which has his advantage in the race, and the other as the Hare,
which has her advantage in the turn, so as it is the advantage of the weaker
creature.

But yet further, this Doctrine of ELENCHES, has a more ample latitude and
extent, than is perceived: namely unto diverse parts of Knowledge: whereof some
are labored, and other omitted. For first, I conceive (though it may seem at
first somewhat strange) that that part which is variably referred, sometimes to
Logic, sometimes to Metaphysicke, touching the Common adjuncts of Essences,
is but an Elenche: for the great Sophisme of all Sophismes, being
Aequiuocation or Ambiguitie of Words and Phrase, specially of such words as
are most general and interueyne every Inquiry: It seems to me that the
true and fruitful use, (leaving vain subtilities and speculations) of the
Inquiry, Maioritie, Minority, Prioritie, Posterioritie, Identitie,
Diversity, Possibility, Act, Totalitie, Parts, Existence, Privation, and
the like, are but wise Cautions against Ambiguityes of Speech. So again, the
distribution of things into certain Tribes, which we call Categories or
Predicaments, are but Cautions against the confusion of Definitions and
Divisions.

Secondly, there is a seducement that works by the strength of the
Impression, and not by the subtlety of the Illaqueation, not so much
perplexing the Reason, as ouer-ruling it by power of the Imagination. But this
part I think more proper to handle, when I shall speak of RHETORIC.

But lastly, there is yet a much more important and profound kind of Fallacies
in the Mind of Man, which I find not observed or enquired at all, and think
good to place here, as that which of all others appertains most to rectify
IVDGEMENT. The force whereof is such, as it does not dazzle, or snare the
understanding in some particulars, but does more generally, and inwardly infect
and corrupt the state thereof. For the mind of Man is far from the Nature of
a clear and equal glass, wherein the beams of things should reflect
according to their true incidence; Nay, it is rather like an enchanted glass,
full of superstition and Imposture, if it be not delivered and reduced. For
this purpose, let us consider the false appearances, that are imposed upon
us by the general Nature of the mind, behoulding them in an example or two,
as first in that instance which is the root of all superstition: Namely, That
to the Nature of the Mind of all Men it is consonant for the Affimatiue, or
Active to affect, more than the negative or Privative. So that a few times
hitting, or presence, counteruayles often times failing, or absence, as was well
answered by Diagoras, to him that showed him in Neptunes Temple, the great
number of pictures, of such as had escaped Shippe-wracke, and had paid their
Vows to Neptune, saying: Advise now, you that think it folly to invoke
Neptune in tempest: Yea, but (says Diagoras) where are they painted that are
drowned? Let us behold it in another instance, namely, That the spirit of
man, being of an equal and vnifourme substance, does usually suppose and
feign in Nature a greater equality and uniformity, than is in truth; Hence it
comes, that the Mathematitians cannot satisfy themselves, except they reduce
the Motions of the Celestial bodies, to perfect Circles, rejecting spirall
lines, and laboring to be discharged of Eecentriques. Hence it comes, that
whereas there are many things in Nature, as it were Monodica sui Iuris; Yet
the cogitations of Man, do feign unto them Relatiues, Parallelles, and
Coniugates, whereas no such thing is; as they have feigned an Element of Fire
to keep square with Earth, Water, and Air, and the like; Nay, it is not
credible, till it be opened, what a number of fictions and fantasies, the
similitude of humane Actions, and Arts, together with the making of Man
Communis Mensura, have brought into natural Philosophy: not much better, than
the Heresy of the Anthropomorphites bredde in the Celles of gross and
solitary Monks, and the opinion of Epicurus, answearable to the same in
heathenisme, who supposed the Gods to be of humane Shape. And therefore
Velleius the Epicurian needed not to have asked, why God should have adorned
the Heavens with Stars, as if he had been an Aedilis: One that should have
set forth some magnificent shows or plays? for if that great Work master
had been of an Humane disposition, he would have cast the stars into some
pleasant and beautiful works, and orders, like the frettes in the Roofes of
Houses, whereas one can scarce find a Posture in square, or tri^angle, or
straight line amongst such an infinite numbers, so differing an Harmony,
there is between the spirit of Man, and the spirit of Nature.

Let us consider again, the false appearances imposed upon us by every Man's
own individual Nature and Custom in that feigned supposition, that Plato
makes of the Cave: for certainly, if a child were continued in a Grotte or
Cave, under the Earth, until maturitie of age, and came suddenly abroad,
he would have strange and absurd Imaginations; So in like manner, although our
persons live in the view of Heaven, yet our spirits are included in the Caves
of our own complexions and Customs: which minister unto us infinite Errors
and vain opinions, if they be not recalled to examination. But hereof we
have given many examples in one of the Errors, or peccant humors, which we
ran briefly over in our first Book.

And lastly, let us consider the false appearances, that are imposed upon us
by words, which are framed, and applied according to the conceit, and
capacities of the Vulgar sort: And although we think we govern our words,
and prescribe it well. Loquendum vt Vulgus, sentiendum vt sapientes: Yet
certain it is, that words, as a ^artars Bow, do shoot back upon the
understanding of the wisest, and mightily entangle, and pernert the Judgment.
So as it is almost necessary in all controversies and disputations, to imitate
the wisdom of the Mathematician^, in setting down in the very beginning,
the definitions of our words and terms, that others may know how we accept
and understand them, and whether they concur with us or no. For it comes to
pass for want of this, that we are sure to end there where we ought to have
begun, which is in questions and differences about words. To conclude
therefore, it must be confessed, that it is not possible to divorce our selves
from these fallacies and false appearances, because they are inseparable from
our Nature and Condition of life; So yet nevertheless Elenchi magni, s^e d^
Idolis animi humani, natiuis and aduentitijs.
the Caution of them (for all Elenches as was said, are but Cautions) does
extremely importe the true conducte of Humane Judgment. The particular
Elenches or Cautions against these three false appearances, I find altogether
deficient.

There remains one part of Judgment of great excellency, which to mine
understanding is so slightly touched, as I may report that also deficient,
which is the application of the differinge kinds of Proofs, to the differing
kinds of Subjects: for there being but four kinds of demonstrations, that
is by the immediate consent of the Mind or Sense; by Induction; by Sophisme;
and by Congruitie, which is that which Aristotle calls Demonstration in Orb,
or Circle, and not a Notioribus, every of these has certain Subjects in the
Matter of Sciences, in which respectively they have chiefest use; and certain
other, from which respectively they ought to be excluded, and the rigor, and
curiosity, in requiring the more severe Proofs in some things, and chiefly
the facility in contenting our selves with the more remiss Proofs in others,
has been amongst the greatest causes of detryment and hinderance to
Knowledge. The distributions and assignations of demonstrations, according to
the Analogy of Sciences, I note as deficient. De Analogia Demonstrationum.


The Custody or retayning of Knowledge, is either in WRITING or MEMORY;
whereof WRITING has two parts; The Nature of the CHARACTER, and the order
of the ENTRY: for the Art of Characters, or other visible notes of Words or
things, it has nearest conjugation with Grammar, and therefore I refer it
to the due place; for the Disposition and Co^ocation of that Knowledge which
we preserve in Writing; It consists in a good Digest of Common Places,
wherein I am not ignorant of the prejudice imputed to the use of Commonplace
Books, as causing a retardation of Reading, and some sloth or relaxation of
Memory. But because it is but a counterfeit thing in Knowledges to be forward
and pregnant, except a man be deep and full; I hold the Entry of Common
places, to be a matter of great use and essence in studying; as that which
assures copy of Invention and contracteth Judgment to a strength. But this is
true, that of the Methodes of Common places, that I have seen, there is none of
any sufficient worth, all of them carrying merely the face of a School, and
not of a World, and referring to vulgar matters, and Pedanticall Divisions
without all life, or respect to Action.

For the other Principal Part of the Custody of Knowledge, which is MEMORY;
I find that faculty in my Judgment weakly enquired of; An Art there is
extant of it; But it seems to me that there are better Precepts, than that
Art, and better practices of that Art, than those recei^ed. It is certain, the
Art as it is) may be raised to points of ostentation prodigious: But in use
(as it is now managed) it is barrein, not burdensome, nor dangerous to
Natural Memory, as is imagined, but barren, that is, not dexterous to be
ayplyed to the serious use of business and occasions. And therefore I make no
more estimation of repeating a great number of Names or Words upon once
hearing; or the pouring forth of a number of Verses or Rimes ex tempore; or
the making of a Satyricall Simile of every thing, or the turning of every
thing to a Jest, or the falsifying or contradicting of every thing by Cavil,
or the like (whereof in the faculties of the Mind, there is great Copy, and
such, as by devise and practice may be exalted to an extreme degree of
wonder;) than I do of the trickcs of Tumblers, Funambuloes, Baladynes; the
one being the same in the Mind, that the other is in the body; Matters of
strangeness without worthynesse.

This Art of Memory, is but built upon two Intentions: The one Praenotion; the
other Emblem: Praenotion, discharges the Indefinite seeking of that we would
remember, and directs us to seek in a narrow Compass: that is, somewhat
that has Congruitie with our Place of Memory: Emblem reduces conceits
intellectual to Images sensible, which strike the Memory more; out of which
Axioms may be drawn much better Practique, than that in use, and besides
which Axioms, there are diverse more, touching help of Memory, not inferior to
them. But I did in the beginning distinguish, not to report those things
deficient, which are but only ill Managed.

There remains the fourth kind of RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE, which is transitiue,
concerning the expressing or transferring our Knowledge to others, which I will
term by the general name of TRADITION OR DELIVERIE. TRADITION has three
parres: the first concerning the ORGANE OF TRADITION: the second, concerning
the METHOD OF TRADITION: And the third, concerning the ILLVSTRATION OF
TRADITION.

For the ORGANE OF TRADITION, it is either SPEECH OR WRITING: for Aristotle
says well: Words are the Images of Cogitations, and Letters are the Images of
Words: But yet is not of necessity, that Cogitations be expressed by the
Medium of Words. For whatsoever is capable of sufficient differences, and
those perceptible by the sense; is in Nature competent to express Cogitations:
And therefore we see in the Commerce of barbarous People, that understand not
one another language, and in the practice of diverse that are dumb and deaf
that men's minds are expressed in gestures, though not exactly, yet to serve the
turn. And we understand further, that it is the use of Chyna, and the
Kingdoms of the High Leuant, to write in Characters real, which express
neither Letters, nor words in gross, but Things or Nottons: in so much as
Countries and Provinces, which understand not one another language, can
nevertheless read one another Writings, because the Characters are accepted
more generally, than the Languages do extend; and (...) therefore they have a
vast multitude of Characters, as many (I suppose, as Radical words.

These Notes of Cogitations are of two sorts; The one when the Note has some
Similitude, or Congruitie with the Notion; The other Ad Placitum, having force
only by Contract or Acceptance. Of the former sort are Hierogliphickes, and
Gestures. For as to Hierogliphickes, (things of Ancient use, and embraced
chiefly by the Egyptians, one of the most ancient Nations) they are but as
continued Impreases and Emblemes. And as for Gestures, they are as Transitory
Hierogliphickes, and are to Hierogliphickes, as Words spoken are to Words
written, in that they abide not; but they have evermore as well, as the other
an affinity with the things signified: as Periander being consulted with how
to preserve a tyranny newly usurped, bid the Messenger attend, and report what
he saw him do, and went into his Garden, and topped all the higest flowers:
signifying that it consisted in the cutting off, and keeping low of the
Nobility and Grandes; Ad Placitum, are the Characters real before mentioned,
and Words: although some have been willing by Curious Inquiry, or rather by apt
fayning, to have derived imposition of Names, from Reason and Intendment: a
speculation elegant, and by reason it searches into Antiquity reverent: but
sparingly mixed with truth, and of small fruit. This portion of knowledge,
touching the Notes of things, De Notis Rerum.
and Cogitations in general, I find not enquired, but deficient. And although
it may seem of no great use, considering that Words, and Writings by letters,
do far excel all the other ways: yet because this part concerns, as it
were the Mint of knowledge (for words, are the tokens current and accepted for
conceits, as Moneys are for values and that it is fit men be not ignorant, that
Moneys may be of another kind, than gold and silver) I thought good to
propound it to better Inquiry.

Concerning SPEECH and WORDS, the Consideration of them has produced the
Science of GRAMMAR: for Man still strives to reintegrate himself in those
benedictions, from which by his fault he has been deprived; And as he has
striuen against the first general Curse, by the Invention of all other Arts:
So has he sought to come soorth of the second general Curse, (which was the
confusion of Tongues) by the Art of GRAMMAR; whereof the use in another tongue
is small: in a foreign tongue more: but most in such Foreign Tongues, as have
ceased to be Vulgar Tongues, and are turned only to learned tongues. The
duty of it is of two Natures: The one Popular, which is for the speedy, and
perfect attayning Languages, as well for intercourse of Speech, as for
understanding of Authors: The other Philosophical, examining the power and
Nature of Words, as they are the foot-steppes and prints of Reason: which
kind of Analogy between Words, and Reason is handled Sparsim, brokenly,
though not entirely: and therefore I cannot report it deficient, though I
think it very worthy to be reduced into a Science by it self.

Unto GRAMMAR also belongs, as an Appendix, the consideration of the
Accidents of Words, which are Measure, sound, and Elevation, or Accent, and
the sweetness and harshnesse of them: whence has issued some curious
observations in Rhetoric, but chiefly Poesy, as we consider it, in respect
of the verse, and not of the Argument: wherein though men in learned Tongues,
do tie themselves to the Ancient Measures, yet in modern Languages, it
seems to me, as free to make new Measures of Verses, as of Daunces: For a
Dance is a measured pace, as a Verse is a measured Speech. In these things
the Sense is better Judge, than the Art.

Coenae fercula nostrae;
Mallem conuiuis, quam placuisse Cocis.
And of the servile expressing Antiquity in an unlike and an unfit Subject, it
is well said, Quod tempore antiquum videtur, id incongruitate est maxim nouum.

For CYPHARS; they are commonly in Letters or Alphabets, but may be in Words.
The kinds of CYPHARS, (besides the SIMPLE CYPHARS with Changes, and
intermixtures of NVLLES, and NONSIGNIFICANTS) are many, according to the Nature
or Rule of the infoulding: WHEELECYPHARS, KAY-CYPHARS, DOVBLES, etc. But the
virtues of them, whereby they are to be preferred, are three; that they be not
laborious to write and read; that they be impossible to discypher; and in
some cases, that they be without suspicion. The highest Degree whereof, is to
write OMNIA PER OMNIA; which is undoubtedly possible, with a proportion
Quintuple at most, of the writing infoulding, to the writing infoulded, and no
other restrainte whatsoever. This Art of Cypheringe, has for Relative, an Art
of Discypheringe; by supposition unprofitable; but, as things are, of great
use. For suppose that Cyphars were well managed, there be Multitudes of them
which exclude the Discypherer. But in regard of the rawnesse and
unskillfulness of the hands, through which they pas^e, the greatest Matters,
are many times carried in the weakest Cyphars.

In the Enumeration of these private and retired Arts, it may be thought I
seek to make a great Muster-Rowle of Sciences; naminge them for show and
ostentation, and to little other purpose. But let those which are skillful in
them judge, whether I bring them in only for appearance, or whether in that
which I speak of them (though in few Marks) there be not some seed of
proficience. And this must be remembered, that as there be many of great
account in their Countries and Provinces, which when they come up to the Seat
of the Estate, are but of mean Rank and scarcely regarded: So these Arts
being here placed with the principal, and supreme Sciences, seem petty
things: yet to such as have chosen them to spend their labors studies in
them, they seem great Matters.

For the METHOD OF TRADITION, I see it has moved a Controversy in our time.
But as in Civil business, if there be a meeting and men fall at Words,
there is commonly an end of the Matter for that time, and no proceeding at all:
So in Learning, where there is much controversy, there is many times little
Inquiry. For this part of knowledge of Method seems to me so weakly
enquired, as I shall report it deficient.

METHOD has been placed, and that not amiss in Logic, as a part of
Judgment; For as the Doctrine of Syllogismes comprehends the rules of
Judgment upon that which is invented; So the Doctrine of Method contains
the rules of Judgment upon that which is to be delivered, for Judgment
precedeth Delivery, as it follows Inventions. Neither is the METHOD, or the
NATVRE OF THE TRADITION material only to the Use of Knowledge, but likewise
to the Progress^on of Knowledge: for since the labor and life of one man,
cannot attain to perfection of Knowledge; the Wisdom of the Tradition, is
that which inspireth the felicity of continuance, and proceeding. And therefore
the most real diversity of Method, is of METHOD REFERRED TO USE, and
METHOD REFERRED TO PROGRESSION, whereof the one may be termed MAGISTRALL,
and the other of PROBATION.

The later whereof seems to be Via deserta and interclusa. For as Knowledges
are now delivered, there is a kind of Contract of Error, between the
Deliverer, and the Receiver: for he that delivers knowledge; desires to
deliver it in such form, as may be best believed; and not as may best
examined: and he that receives knowledge, desires rather present
satisfaction, than expectant Inquiry, and so rather not to doubt, than not to
err: glory making the Author not to lay open his weakness, and sloth making
the Disciple not to know his strength.

But knowledge, that is delivered as a threade to be spunne on, ought to be
delivered and intimated, if it were possible, In the same Method wherein it
was invented; and so is it possible of knowledge induced. But in this same
anticipated and prevented knowledge; no man knows how he came to the
knowledge which he has obtained. But yet nevertheless Secundum maius and
minus, a man may reuisite, and descend unto the foundations of his Knowledge
and Consent: and so transplant it into another, as it grew in his own Mind.
For it is in Knowledges, as it is in Plants; if you mean to use the Plant, it
is no matter for the Roots: But if you mean to remove it to grow, then it
is more assured to rest upon roots, than Slippes: So the delivery of
Knowledges (as it is now used) is as of fair bodies of Trees without the
Roots: good for the Carpenter, but not for the Planter: But if you will have
Sciences grow; it is less matter for the shafte, or body of the Tree, so you
look well to the taking up of the Roots. Of which kind of delivery the
Method of the Mathematiques, De Method syncera, sieve ad filios Scientiarum.
in that Subject, has some shadow; but generally I see it neither put in ure,
nor put in Inquisition: and therefore note it for deficient.

Another diversity of METHOD there is, which has some affinity with the
former, used in some cases, by the discretion of the Ancients; but disgraced
since by the Impostures of many vain persons, who have made it as a false
light for their counterfei^e Marchandizes; and that is Enigmaticali and
Disclosed. The pretense whereof, is to remove the vulgar Capacities from
being admitted to the secrets of Knowledges, and to reserve them to selected
Auditors: or wits of such sharpness as can pearce the veil.

Another diversity of METHOD, whereof the consequence is great, is the
delivery of knowledge in APHORISMS, or in METHODES; wherein we may observe,
that it has been too much taken into Custom, out of a few Axioms or
Observations, upon any Subject, to make a solemn, and formal Art; filling
it with some Discourses, and illustratinge it with Examples; and digesting it
into a sensible Method: But the writing in APHORISMS, has many excellent
virtues, whereto the writing in Method does not approach.

For first, it tries the Writer, whether he be superficial or solid: For
Aphorisms, except they should be ridiculous, cannot be made but of the pyth
and heart of Sciences: for discourse of illustration is cut off, Recitalles of
Examples are cut off: Discourse of Connection, and order is cut off;
Descriptions of Practice, are cut off; So there remains nothing to fill
the Ap^ismes, but some good quantity of Observation: And therefore no man can
suffice, nor in reason will attempt to write Aphorisms, but he that is sound
and grounded. But in Methodes,

Tantum Series iuncturaque Pollet,
Tantum de Medio sumptis, accedit honoris:
As a Man shall make a great show of an Art, which if it were disioynted, would
come to little. Secondly; Methodes are more fit to win Consent; or belief;
but less fit to point to Action; for they carry a kind of Demonstration in
Orb or Circle, one part illuminating another; and therefore satisfy. But
particulars being dispersed, do best agree with dispersed directions. And
lastly Aphorisms, representing a knowledge broken, do inuit men to enquire
further; whereas Methodes carrying the show of a Total, do secure men; as if
they were at furthest.

Another Diversity of METHOD, which is likewise of great weight, is, The
handling of knowledge by Assertions, and their Proofs; or by Questions, and
their Determinations: The latter kind whereof, if it be immoderately
followed, is as prejudicial to the proceeding of Learning, as it is to the
proceedinge of an Army, to go about to besiege every little Forte, or Hold.
For if the Field be kept, and the sum of the Enterprise pursued, those
smaller things will come in of themselves; Indeed a Man would not leave some
important piece Enemy at his back. In like manner, the use of confutation in
the delivery of Sciences ought to beverie sparing; and to serve to remove
strong Preoccupations and Preiudgements, and not to minister and excite
Disputations and doubts.

Another Diversity of Methodes, is, According to the Subject or Matter, which
is handled. For there is a great difference in Delivery of the Mathematiques,
which are the most abstracted of knowledges, and Policy, which is the most
immersed; And howsoever contention has been moved, touching an uniformity of
Method in Multiformitie of Matter: Yet we see how that opinion, besides the
weakness of it, has been of ill desert, toward Learning, as that which
takes the way, to reduce Learning to certain empty and barren Generalities;
being but the very Husks, and Shales of Sciences, all the kernel being
forced out, and expulsed, with the torture and press of the Method: And
therefore as I did allow well of particular topiques for Invention: so I do
allow likewise of particular Methodes of Tradition.

Another Diversity of Judgment in the delivery and teaching of knowledge,
is, According unto the light and presuppositions of that which is delivered:
For that knowledge, which is new and foreign from opinions received, is to
be delivered in another form, than that that is agreeable and familiar; And
therefore Aristotle, when he thinks to tax Democritus, does in truth, commend
him; where he says: If we shall indeed dispute, and not follow after
Similitudes, etc. For those, whose conceits are seated in popular opinions,
need only but to prove or dispute: but those, whose Conceits are beyond
popular opinions, have a double labor; the one to make themselves conceived,
and the other to prove and demonstrate. So that it is of necessity with them
to have recourse to similitudes, and translations, to express themselves. And
therefore in the Infancy of Learning, and in rude times, when those Conceits,
which are now triuiall, were then new; the World was full of Parables and
Similitudes; for else would men either have passed over without Mark, or else
rejected for Paradoxes, that which was offered; before they had understood or
judged. So; in Divine Learning, we see how frequent Parables and Tropes are;
For it is a Rule, That whatsoever Science is not consonant to presuppositions,
must pray in aid of Similitudes.

There be also other Diversities of METHODES vulgar and received: as that of
Resolution, or Analysis, of Constitution, or Systasis, of Concealment, or
Cryptique, etc. which I do allow well of; though I have stood upon those
which are least handled and observed. All which I have remembered to this
purpose, because I would erecte and constitute De prudentia Traditionis.
one general Inquiry (which seems to me deficient) touching the Wisdom of
Tradition.

But unto this part of Knowledge, concerning METHOD, does further belong, not
only the Architecture of the whole frame of a Work, but also the several
beams and Columns thereof; not as to their stuff, but as to their quantity,
and figure: And therefore, Method considers, not only the disposition of
the Argument or Subject, but likewise the Propositions: not as to their Truth
or Matter, but as to their Limitation and Manner. For herein Ramus merited
better a great deal, in reviving the good Rules of Propositions, (...). etc.
than he did in introducing the Canker of Epitomes: And yet, (as it is the
Condition of Humane things, that according to the ancient Fables, The most
precious things have the most pernicious Keepers) It was so, that the attempt
of the one, made him fall upon the other. For he had need be well conducted,
that should design to make Axioms Conuertible: If he make them not withal
Circular, and Non promouent, or Incurring into themselves: but yet the
Intention was excellent.

The other Considerations of Method, concerning Propositions, are chiefly
touching the utmost Propositions, which limit the Dimensions of Sciences: for
every Knowledge may be fitly said, besides the Profunditie (which is the
truth and substance of it, that makes it solid) to have a Longitude, and a
Latitude: accounting the latitude toward other Sciences: and the Longitude
toward Action: that is, from the greatest Generality, to the most particular
Precept: The one gives Rule how far one knowledge ought to intermeddle
within the Province of another, which is the Rule they call (...). The other
gives Rule, unto what degree of particularitie, a knowledge should descend:
which latter I find passed over in silence; being in my Judgment, the more
material. For certainly, there must be somewhat left to practice; but how
much is worthy the Inquiry: we see remote and superficial Generalities, do
but offer Knowledge, to scorn of practical men: and are no more ayding to
practice, than an Ortelius universal Map, is to direct the way between
London and York. The better sort of Rules, have been not unfitly compared to
glasses of steel vnpullished; where you may see the Images of things, but
first they must be filed: So the Rules will help, if they be labored and
pullished by practice. But how Christallyne they De Productione Axiomatum.
may be made at the first, and how far forth they may be pullished
aforehand, is the question; the Inquiry whereof, seeemeth to me deficient.

There has been also labored, and put in practice a Method, which is not a
lawful Method, but a Method of Imposture; which is to deliver knowledges in
such manner, as men may speedily come to make a show of Learning, who have it
not; such was the travail of Raymundus Lullius, in making that Art, which
bears his name; not unlike to some Books of Typocosmy, which have been made
since; being nothing but a Mass of words of all Arts; to give men
countenance, that those which use the terms; might be thought to understand
the Art; which Collections are much like a Frippers or Brokers shop; that
has ends of every thing, but nothing of worth.

Now we descend to that part, which concerns the ILLVSRATION OF TRADITION,
comprehended in that Science, which we call RHETORIC, OR ART OF ELOQVENCE; A
Science excellent, and excellently well labored. For although in true value,
it is inferior to Wisdom, as it is said by God to Moses, when he disabled
himself, for want of this Faculty, Aaron shall be thy Speaker, and thou
shall be to him as God: Yet with people it is the more mighty; For so Solomon
says: Sapiens Cord appellabitur Prudens; sed dulcis Eloquio Maiora reperict:
Signifying that profoundnesse of Wisdom, will help a Man to a Name or
Admiration; but that it is Eloquence, that preuayleth in an active life; And as
to the laboring of it, the Emulation of Aristotle, with the Rhetoricians of
his time, and the experience of Cicero, has made them in their Works of
Rhetorickes, exceed themselves. Again, the excellency of Examples of
Eloquence, in the Orations of Demosthenes and Cicero, added to the perfection
of the Precepts of Eloquence, has doubled the progression in this Art: And
therefore, the Deficiences which I shall note, will rather be in some
Collections, which may as Hand-maydes attend the Art; than in the Rules, or use
of the Art it self.

Notwithstanding, to stir the Earth a little about the Roots of this
Science, as we have done of the rest; The duty and Office of Rhetoric is, To
apply Reason to Imagination, for the better moving of the will; For we see
Reason is disturbed in the Administration thereof by three means; by
Illaqueation, or Sophisme, which pertaines to Logic; by Imagination or
Impression, which pertaines to Rhetoric, and by Passion or Affection, which
pertaines to Morality. And as in Negotiation with others; men are wrought by
cunning, by Importunity, and by vehemency; So in this Negotiation within our
selves; men are undermined by Inconsequences, solicited and importuned, by
Impressions or Obuersations: and transported by Passions: Neither is the Nature
of Man so unfortunately built, as that those Powers and Arts should have force
to disturb Reason, and not to establish and advance it: For the end of
Logic, is to teach a form of Argument, to secure Reason, and not to
entrappe it. The end of Morality, is to procure the Affections to obey Reason,
and not to invade it. The end of Rhetoric, is to fill the Imagination to
second Reason, and not to oppress it: for these abuses of Arts come in, but Ex
oblique, for Caution.

And therefore it was great Injustice in Plate, though springing out of a just
hatred of the Rhetoricians of his time, to esteem of Rhetoric, but as a
voluptuarie Art, resembling it to Cookerie, that did mar wholesome Meats, and
help unwholesome by variety of sawces, to the pleasure of the taste. For we
see that speech is much more conversant in adorning that which is good, than in
coloring that which is evil: for there is no man but speaks more honestly,
than he can do or think; And it was excellently noted by Thucidides in Cleon,
that because he used to hold on the bad side in Causes of estate; therefore he
was ever inueying against Eloquence, and good speech; knowing that no man can
speak fair of Courses sordide and base. And therefore as Plato said
elegantly: That virtue, if she could be seen, would move great love and
affection: So seeing that she cannot be showed to the Senca, by corporal
shape, the next degree is, to show her to the Imagination in lively
representation: for to show her to Reason, only in subtilitie of Argument, was
a thing ever derided in Chrysippus, and many of the Stoykes, who thought to
thrust virtue upon men by sharp disputations and Conclusions, which have no
Sympathy with the will of Man.

Again, if the affections in themselves were plyant and obedient to Reason, it
were true, there should be no great use of persuasions and insinuations to
the will, more than of naked proposition and Proofs: but in regard of the
continual Mutinies and Seditions of the Affections:

Video meliora, Proboque; D^teriora sequor;
Reason would become Captive and servile, if Eloquence of Persuasions, did not
practice and win the Imagination, from the affections part, and contract a
Confederacy between the Reason and Imagination, against the Affections: For
the Affections themselves, carry ever an appetite to good, as Reason does: The
difference is, That the Affection beholds merely the present; Reason
behouldeth the future, and sum of time. And therefore, the Present, filling
the Imagination more; Reason is commonly vanquished; But after that force of
Eloquence and persuasion, has made things future, and remote, appear as
present, than upon the revolt of the Imagination, Reason pre^ayleth.

We conclude therefore, that Rhetoric can be no more charged, with the
coloring of the worse part, than Logic with Sophistry, or Morality with
Vice. For we know the Doctrines of Contraries are the same, though the use be
opposite: It appears also, that Logic differs from Rhetoric, not only
as the fist, from the pawme, the one close, the other at large; but much more
in this, that Logic handles Reason exact, and in truth; and Rhetoric
handles it, as it is planted in popular opinions and Manners: And therefore
Aristotle does wisely place Rhetoric, as between Logic on the one side,
and Moral or Civil Knowledge on the other, as participating of both: for the
Proofs and Demonstrations of Logic, are toward all men indifferent, and the
same: But the Proofs and persuasions of Rhetoric, ought to differ according
to the Auditors,

Orpheus in Syluis, inter Delphinas Arion;
Which application, in perfection of Idea, ought to extend so far: that if a
Man should speak of the same thing to several persons: he should speak to
them all respectively and several ways: though this Politic part of
Eloquence in private Speech, it is easy for the greatest Orators to want:
whilst by the observing their well graced fourmes of speech, they leese the
volubilitie of Application: and therefore, Deprudentia sermonis priuati.
it shall not be amiss to recommend this to better inquiry, not being
curious, whether we place it here, or in that part which concerns Policy.

Now therefore will I descend to the deficiences, which (as I said) are but
Attendances: and first, I do not find the Wisdom and diligence Colores boni
and mali, simplicis and comparati.
of Aristotle well poursued, who began to make a Collection of the popular
signs and colors of good and evil, both simple and comparatiue, which are as
the Sophismes of Rhetoric, (as I touched before.) For Example.

SOPHISMA.

Quod laudatur, bonum: Quod vttuperatur, malum.

REDARGVTIO.

Laudat vaenales, qui vult extrudere merces.

Malum est, Malum est (inquit Emptor) sed cum re^rit, tumgloriabitur. The
defects in the labor of Aristotle are three: One, that there be but a few of
many: another, that their Elenches are not annexed; and the third, that he
conceived but a part of the use of them: for their use is not only in
probation, but much more in Impression. For many fourmes are equal in
Signification, which are differing in Impression: as the difference is great in
the piercing of that which is sharp, and that which is flat, though the
strength of the percussion be the same: for there is no man, but will be a
little more raised by hearing it said: Your enemies will be glad of this,

Hos I thacus velit, and magnomercentur Atridae,
Than by hearing it said only, This is evil for you.

Secondly, I do resume also, that which I mentioned before, touching Provision
or Praeparatorie store, for the Furniture of speech, and readiness of
Invention; which appears to be of two sorts; The one in resemblance to a
shop of pieces unmade up; the other to a shopp of things ready made up, both
to be applied to that which is frequent, and most in request; The former of
these I will call Antitheta, and the latter Formulae.

Antitheta are Theses argued, pro and contra, wherein men may be more large and
laborious; but (in such as Antitheta rerum.
are able to do it) to avoid prolixity of entry, I wish the seeds of the
several arguments to be cast up into some brief and acute sentences: not to
be cyted: but to be as Skaynes or Bottomes of thread, to be vnwinded at
large, when they come to be used: supplying authorities, and Examples by
reference.

Pro verbis legis,

Non est interpretatio, sed diuinatio, quae recedit a littera,
Cum receditur a littera Index transit in legislatorem,
Pro sententia Legis.

Ex omnibus verbis est Elu^endus sensus, qui interpretatur singula:
Formulae are but decent and apt passages or conueyances of speech, which may
serve indifferently for differing subjects, as of Preface, Conclusion,
Digression, Transition, Excusation, etc. For as in buildings there is great
pleasure and use in the well casting of the staire cases, entryes, doors,
windows, and the like, so in speech, the conueyances and passages are of
special ornament and effect.

A conclusion in a Del^eratiue.

So may we redeem the faults passed and prevent the inconue niences future.

There remayn two Appendices touching the tradition of knowledge, The one
Critical, The other Pedanticall. For all knowledge is either delivered by
Teachers, or attained by men's proper endeavors: And therefore as the principal
part of Tradition of knowledge concerns chiefly in writing of Books; So the
Relative part thereof concerns reading of Books Whereunto appertayn
incidently these consideratio^s. The first is concerning the true Correction
and editio^ of Authors, wherein nevertheless rash diligence has don great
prejudice. For these Critiques have often presumed that that which they
vnderstandnot, is false set down; As the Priest, that where he found it written
of S. Paul Demissus est per sportam, me^ded his book, and made it Demissus est
per portam because, Sperta was an hard word, and out of his reading; and surely
their errors, though they be not so palpable and ridiculous, yet are of the
same kind. And therefore as it has been wisely noted, the most corrected
copies are commonly the least correct.

The second is concerning the exposition and explication of Authors, which
rests in Annotations and Co^mentaryes, wherein it is over usual to blaunch the
obscure places, and discourse upon the plain.

The third is concerning the times, which in many cases give great light to
true Interpretations.

The fourth is concerning some brief Censure and judgment of the Authors,
that men thereby may make some election unto themselves, what Books to read:

And the fifth is concerning the Syntax and disposition of studies, that men may
know in what order or pursuit to read.

For PEDANTICALL knowledge, it contains that difference of Tradition which is
proper for youth: Whereunto appertain diverse considerations of greatfruit.

As first the tyming and seasoning of knowledges, as with what to initiate
them, and from what for a time to refrain them:

Secondly, the consideration where to begin with the easiest, and so proceed
to the more difficult, And in what courses to press the more difficulte and
then to turn them to the more easy: for it is one Method to practice
swimming with bladders, and another to practice dancing with heavy shoes.

A third is the application of learning according unto the propriety of the
wits; for there is no defect in the faculties intellectual, but seems to
have a proper Cure contained in some studies; As for example, If a Child be
Bird-witted, that is, has not the faculty of attention, the Mathematiques
gives a remedy thereunto; for in them, if the wit be caught away but a
moment, one is new to begin. And as sciences have a propriety toward faculties
for Cure and help; So faculties or powers have a Simpathy toward Sciences for
excellency or speedy profiting: And therefore it is an enquity of great wisdom
what kinds of wits and Natures are most apt and proper for what sciences.

Fourthly the ordering of exercises is matter of great consequence to hurt or
help; For as is well ob served by Cicero, men in exercising their faculties if
they be not well advised do exercise their faults and get ill habits as well
as good; so as there is a great judgment to be had in the continuance and
intermission of Exercises. It were to long to particularize a number of other
consideratio^s of this nature, things but of mean appearance, but of singular
efficacy. For as the wronging or cherishing of seeds or young plants, is that,
that is most important to their thriuing And as it was noted, that the first
six kings being in truth as Tutors of the State of Rome in the infancy
thereof, was the principal cause of the immense greatness of that state which
followed. So the culture and manurance of Minds in youth, has such a forcible
(though unseen) operacion, as hardly any length of time or contention of labor
can counteruaile it afterward. And it is not amiss to observe also, how small
and mean faculties gotten by Education, yet when they fall into great men or
great matters, do work great and important effects: whereof we see a notable
example in Tacitus of two Stage-plaiers, Percennius and Vibulenus, who by their
faculty of playing, put the Pannonian armies into an extreme tumulte and
combustion. For there arising a mutiny amongst them, upon the death of
Augustus Caesar, Bloesus the lieuetenant had committed some of the Mutiners
which were suddenly rescued: whereupon Vtbulenus got to be heard speak, which
he did in this manner, These poor innocent wretches appointed to cruel death,
you have restored to behold the light. But who shall restore my brother to me,
or life unto my brother? that was sent hither in message from the legions of
Germany, to treat of the common Cause, and he has murdered him this last night
by some of his sencers and ruffians, that he has about him for his
executioners upon Soldiers: Answer Blaesus, what is done with his body: The
mortallest Enem'es do not deny burial: when I have performed my last duties
to the Corpse with kisses, with tears, command me to be slain besides him, so
that these my fellows for our good meaning, and our true hearts to the Legions
may have leave to bury us. With which speech he put the army into an infinite
fury and uproar, whereas truth was he had no brother, neither was there any
such matter, but he plaide it merely as if he had been upon the stage.

But to return, we are now come to a period of RATIONAL KNOVVLEDGES, wherein
if I have made the divisions other than those that are received, yet would I
not be thought to disallow all those divisions, which I do not use. For there
is a double necessity imposed upon me of altering the divisions. The one
because it differs in end and purpose, to sort together those things which
are next in Nature, and those things which are next in use. For if a secretary
of Estate, should sort his papers, it is like in his study, or general
Cabinet, he would sort together things of a Nature, as Treaties, Instructions,
etc. But in his Boxes, or particular Cabinet, he would sort together those
that he were like to use together, though of several Natures: So in this
general Cabynet of knowledge, it was necessary for me to follow the divisions
of the Nature of things, whereas if my self had been to handle any particular
knowledge, I would have respected the Divisions fittest for use. The other,
because the bringing in of the Deficiences did by Consequence alter the
Partitions of the rest, For let the knowledge extant (for demonstration sake)
be 15. Let the knowledge with the Deficiences be 20. the parts of 15. are not
the parts of 20, for the parts of 15, are 3. and 5. the parts of 20. are 2. 4.
5. and 10. So as these things are without Contradiction, and could not
otherwise be.

WE proceed now to that knowledge which co^ sidereth of the APPETITE and WILL
OF Man, whereof Solomon says Anteomnia fili custodi cor tuum, nam inde
procedunt actiones vilae. In the handling of this science, those which have
written seem to me to have done as if a man that professed to teach to write
did only exhibit fair copies of Alphabets, and letters joined, without giving
any precepts or directio^s, for the carriage of the hand and framing of the
letters. So have they made good and fair Exemplars and coppies, carieng the
draughts and pour traiturs of Good. Virtue, Duty, Felicity. propou^ding the^
well described as the true objects and scopes of ma^s will and desires: But how
to attain these excellent marks, and how to frame and subdue the will of man to
become true and conformable to these pursuites, they pass it over altogether,
or slightly and unprofitably For it is not the disputing. That moral virtues
are in the Mind of man by habit and not by nature: or the distinguishing.
That generous spirits are won by doctrines and persuasions, and the vulgar
sort by reward and punishment, and the like scattered glances and touches that
can excuse the absence of this part.

The reason of this omission I suppose to be that hidden Rock whereupon both
this and many other barques of knowledge have been cast away, which is, that
men have despised to be conversant in ordinary and common matters, the
judicious direction whereof nevertheless is the wisest doctrine: (for life
consists not in novelties nor subtilities) but contrariwise they have
compounded Sciences chiefly of a certain resplendent or lustrous mass of
matter chosen to give glory either to the subtillity of disputacions or to the
eloquence of discourses. But Seneca, gives an excellent check to eloquence
Nocet illis eloquentia, quibus non rerum cupiditatem facit sed sui, doctrines
should be such as should make men in love with the Lesson, and not with the
Teacher, being directed to the Auditors benefit, and not to the Authors
commendation: And therefore those are of the right kind which may be concluded
as Demosthenes concludes his counsel Quae si feceritis non Oratorem duntaxat
inpraesentia laudabitis sed vosmetipsos etia^ no^ ita multo post statu rerum
vestrarum meliore.

Neither needed men of so excellent parts to have despaired of a Fortune,
(which the Poet Virgill promised himself, and indeed obtained) who got as much
glory of eloquence, wit, and learning in the expressing of the obseruacions of
husbandry, as of the heroical acts of Aeneas.

Nec sunt animi dubious verbis ea vincere magnum.
Quam sit and augustis his addere rebus honorem.
And surely if the purpose be in good earnest not to write at leisure that
which me^ may read at leisure, but really to instruct and suborne Action and
active life, these Georgickes of the mind concerning the husba^dry and tillage
thereof, are no less worthy the^ the heroical descriptio^s of virtue, duty, and
felicity wherefore the maine and primitive division of Moral knowledge seems
to be into the EXEMPLAR or PLATFORM of GOOD, and the REGIMENT or CVLTVRE OF
THE MIND; The one describing the nature of Good the other prescribing rules how
to subdue, apply and accomodate the will of man thereunto.

The Doctrine touching the PLATFORM or NaTVRE of GOOD considers it either
SIMPLE or COMPARED either the kinds of Good or the degrees of Good: In the
later whereof those infinite disputations, which were touching the supreme
degree thereof, which they term Felicity, Beatitude, or the highest Good, the
doctrines concerning which were as the heathen Divinity, are by the christian
faith discharged. And as Aristotle says, That young men may be happy, but not
otherwise, but by Hope; So we must all acknowledge our Minority, and embrace
the felicity, which is by hope of the future world.

Freed therefore, and delivered from this doctrine of the Philosophers heaven,
whereby they feigned an higher elevation of Man's Nature, then was; For we see in
what an height of style Seneca writes, Vere Magnum, habere fragilitatem
hominis, securitatem Dei.) We may with more sobriety and truerh receive the
rest of their Enquiries, and labors? Wherein for the Nature of Good Positive,
or simple, they have set it down excellently, in describing the fourmes of
Virtue and Duty, with their situations and postures, in distributing them into
their kinds, parts, Provinces, Actions, and Administrations, and the like; Nay
further, they have commended them to Man's Nature, and spirit with great
quickness of Argument, and beauty of persuasions, yea, and fortified and
entrenched them (as much as discourse can do) against corrupt and popular
opinions. Again, for the degrees, and Comparatiue Nature of Good, they have
also excellentlye handled it in their triplicity of Good; in the comparisons
between a Contemplative and an active life, in the distinction between virtue
with reluctation, and virtue secured; in their encounters between honesty and
profit, in their ballancing of virtue with virtue, and the like; so as this
part deserves to be reported for excellentlye labored.

Notwithstanding, if before they had commen to the popular and received Nocions
of virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, and the rest, they had stayed a little
longer upon the Enquirye, concerning the Roots of Good and evil, and the
Strings of those Roots, they had given in my opinion, a great light to that
which followed; and specially if they had consulted with Nature, they had made
their doctrins less prolixe, and more profound; which being by them in part
omitted, and in part handled with much Confusion, we will endeavor to resume,
and open in a more clear Manner.

There is fourmed in every thing a double Nature of Good; the one, as every
thing is, a Total or substantive in it self; the other, as it is a part or
Member of a greater Body; whereof the the later is in degree the greater, and
the worthier, because it tends to the conservation of a more general form.
Therefore we see, the Iron in particular simpathye moves to the Loadstone;
But yet if it exceed a cettayne quantity, it forsakes the affection to the
Loadstone and like a good patriot moves to the Earth which is the Region and
Country of Massy Bodies; so may we go forward, and see that Water and Massy
bodies move to the Center of the earth But rather the^ to suffer a diuulsio^ in
the co^tinua^ce of Nature they will move upwards from the Center of the Earth:
forsaking their duty to the Earth in regard of their duty to the World. This
double nature of Good and the com-paratiue thereof is much more engraue^ upon
Man, if he degenerate not: unto who^ the Co^seruation of duty to the public
ought to be much more pecious then the Conservation of life and being:
according to that Memorable speech of Pompeius Magnus when being in commission
of purueiance for a famine at Rome, and being dissuaded with great vehemence
and instance by his frinds about him that he should not hazard himself to Sea
in an exreemity of weather he said only to them: Necesse est vt eam, non vt
viuam: But it may be truly affirmed that there was never any philosophy,
Religion or other discipline, which did so plainly and highly exalt the good
which is Communicatiue and depresse the good which is private and particular as
the Holy faith: well declaring that it was the same God, that gave the
Christian Law to men, who gave those Laws of nature, to inaminate Creatures
that we spoke of before; for we read that the elected Saints of God have
wished themselves Anathemized, and razed out of the Book of life, in an
ecstasy of Charity, and infinite feeling of Communion.

This being set down and strongly planted does judge and determine most of the
Controversies wherein Moral Philosophy is Conversant; For first it decideth
the question touching the preferment of the Contemplative or active life, and
decideth it against Aristotle; For all the reasons which he brings for the
Contemplative, are private, and respecting the pleasure and dignity of a man's
self, (in which respects no question the contemplative life has the
preemynence;) not much unlike to that Comparison, which Pythagoras made for the
gracing and Mag nifying of Philosophy, and Contemplacion who being asked what
he was, answered: That if Hiero were ever at the Olimpian games, he knew the
Manner, that some came to try their fortune for the prizes, and some came as
Merchants to utter their commodities, and some came to make good cheer, and
meet their friends, and some came to look on, and that he was one of them that
came to look on. But men must know, that in this Theater of Man's life, it is
reserved only for God and Angels to be loo kers on, Neither could the like
question ever have been received in the Church, notwithstanding their
(Preticsa in oculis Domini mors sanctorum eius) by which place they would exalt
their Civil death, and reguler professions, but upon this defense, that the
Monastical life is not simple Contemplative, but performs the duty either of
incessant prayers and supplications which has been truly esteemed as an office
in the church, or else of writing or in taking instructions for writing
concerning the law of God as Moses did, when he abode so long in the Mount. And
so we see Henoch the. 7. from Adam who was the first Contemplative and walked
with God, yet did also endow the Church with prophesy which Saint Jude cites.
But for contemplation which should be finished in itself without casting
beams upon society, assure^ly divinity knows it not.

It decideth also the controuersyes between Zeno and Socrates, and their
schools and successions on the oneside, who placed felicity in virtue simply
or attended: the actions and exercises whereof do chiefly embrace and concern
society; and on the other side, the C^renaiques and Epicureans, whoplaced it in
pleasure and made virtue, (as it is used in some comedyes of Errors, wherein
the Mistres and the Maid change ha bits) to be but as a servant, without
which, pleasure cannot be served and attended, and the reformed school of the
Epicurea^s, which placed it in serenity of mind and freedom from perturbation:
as if they would have deposed Jupiter again, and restored Saturn, and the
first age, when there was no summer nor winter, spring nor Autumn, but al
after one air and season And Herillus, which placed felicity in extinguishme^t
of the disputes of the mind, making no fixed Nature of Good and evil,
esteeming things according to the cleernes of the desires, or the reluctation:
which opini on was revived in the heresy of the Anabaptists, mea suring things
according to the motions of the spirit, and the constancy or wavering of
belief, all which are manifest to tend to private repose and co^tentment, and
not to point of society.

It censureth also the philosophy of Epictetus which presupposes that felicity
must be placed in those things which are in our power, least we belyable to
fortune and disturbance: as if it were not a thing much more happy to sail in
good and virtuous ends for the public, then to obtain all that we can wish
to our selves in our proper fortune: as Consaluo said to his soldiers, showing
them Naples and protesting, he had rather die one foot forwards, then to have
his life secured for long, by one foot of retrayt: Whereunto the wisdom of
that heavenly Leader has signed, who has affirmed that A good Conscience is a
continual Feast, showing plainly that the conscience of good intencions
howsoever succeeding, is a more continual joy to nature, then all the
provision which can be made for security and repose.

It censureth likewise that abuse of Philosophy, which grew general about the
time of Epictetus, in converting it into an occupation or profession: as if the
purpose had been, not to resist and extinguish perturbations, but to fly and
avoid the causes of them, and to shape a particular kind and course of life to
that end, introducing such an health of mind, as was that health of body, of
which Aristotle speaks of Herodic^, who did nothing nothing all kis life
long, but intend his health, whereas if men refer themselves to duties of
Society; as that health of Body is best, which is ablest to endure all
alterations and extremityes, So likewise that health of Mind is most proper,
which can go through the greatest temptations and perturbations. So as
Diogenes opinion is to be accepted, who Commended not them which absteyned, but
them which sustained, and could refrain their Mind in Precipitio, and could
give unto the mind (as is used in horsman ship) the shortest stop or turn.

Lastly it censureth the Tenderness and want of application in some of the
most ancient and reverend Philosophers and Philosophical men, that did retire
too easily from Civil business, for avoiding of Indignities and
perturbations, whereas the resolution of men truly Moral, ought to be such, as
the same Consaluo said, the honor of a souldior should be F tela Crassiore, and
not so fine, as that every thing should catch in it, and endanger it.

To resume private or particular good, it falls into the division of Good
Active and Passive; For this difference of Good, (not unlike to that which
amongst the Romans was expressed in the familiar or household terms of Promus,
and Condus,) is formed also in all things, and is best disclosed in the two
several Appetites in crea tures; the one to preserve or continue themselves,
and the other to dilate or Multiply themselves; whereof the later seems to be
the worthyer; For in Nature the heavens, which are the more worthy, are the A
gent, and the earth, which is the less woorthye is the Patient. In the
pleasures of living creatures, that of generation is greater then that of
food. In divine Doctrine, Beatius est dare quam accipere: And in life there is
no man's spirit so soft but estemeth the effecting of somewhat that he has fixed
in his desire more then sensuality: which priority of the Active Good, is much
vpheld by the Consideration of our estate to be mortal and exposed to fortune:
for, if we might have a perpetuity and Certainty in our pleasures, the State
of them would advance their price. But when we see it is but Magni aestimamus
Mori tardius and Ne glorieris de crastino. Nescis Partum diei it makes us to
desire to have somewhat secured and exempted from Time, which are only our
deeds and works, as it is said Operaeorum sequuntur eos. The pre-eminence
likewise of this active good is vpheld by the affection which is natural in
man toward variety and proceeding which in the pleasures of the sense which
is the principal part of Passive good) can have no great latitude. Cogita
quamdiu eadem feceris: Ci bus, Somnus, Ludus, per h^nc Circulu^ curritur, mori
velle no^ tantu^ fertis aut miser aut prudens sed etia^ fastidiosus potest. But
in enterprises, pursutes and purposes of life there is much variety, whereof men
are se^sible with pleasure in their inceptions, progressions, recoyls, reinteg
ations, approches and atteynings to their ends. So as it was well said: Vita
sieve proposito languida and vaga est. Neither has this Active good an^
Identity with the good of Society, though, in some case, it has an incidence
into it: For although it do many times bring forth Acts of Benefice^ce yet it
is with a respect private to a ma^s own power, glory, amplificatio^,
co^tinua^ce: (...) appears plainly when it finds a contrary Subject For
that Gyga^tine state of mind which possesses the trowblers or the world, such
as was Lucius Sylla and infinite other in smaller model, who would have all me^
happy or unhappy as they were their friends or Enemies, and would give fourm to
the world according to their own humors (which is the true Theomachy)
pretends and aspireth to Active good, though it recedeth furthest from good
of Society which we have determined to be the greater.

To resume Passive Good it receives a subdiuision of Conseruatiue and
Perfectiue. For let us take a brief Review of that which we have said, we have
spoken first of the Good of Society the intention whereof embraces the Fourm
of Human Nature, whereof we are members and Portions: and not our own proper
and Indiuidual form: we have spoken of Active good and supposed it as a part
of Private and particu lar good. And rightly: For there is impressed upon all
things a triple desire or appetite proceeding from love to themselves, one of
preserving and contynuing their form, another of Advancing and Perfitting their
fourm and a third of Multiplying and extending their iourme upon other things:
whereof the multiplying er signature of it upon other things, is that which we
handled by the name of Active good. So as there remains the conseruing of it
and parfiting or raising of it: which later is the highest degree of Passive
good For to preserve in state, is the less; to preserve with advancement is
the greater. So in man

Ign^us est ollis vigor, and coelestis ^rigo. His approach or Assumptio^ to
divine or Angel^icall Nature, is the perfection of his form, The error or
false Imitatio^ of which good is that whichis the tempest of humane life
whileman upon the instinct of an adua^cement Formal, and Essential is carried
to seek an advancement Local. For as those which are sick, and find no
remedy, do tumble up and down and change place, as if by a Remove Local,
they could obtain a Remove Internal: So is it with men in ambition, when
failing of the mean to exalt their Nature, they are in a perpetual estuation
to exalte their Place. So then passive Good, is, as was said, either
Conseruatiue or Perfectiue.

To resume the good of conservation or Comfort, which consists in the
sruicion of that which is agreeable to our Natures, it seems to be the most
pure and Natural of pleasures, but yet the sostest and the lowest. And this
also receives a^ difference, which has neither been well judged of, nor well
inquired. For the good of fruition or contentment, is placed either in the
Sincerenesse of the sruition, or in the quickness and vigor of it, the one
superinduced by the Aequality, the o there by Vicissitude: the one having less
mixture of Evil, the other more impressio^ of Good. Whether of these, is the
greter good, is a question co^trouerted, but whether maus nature may not be
capable of both, is a question not inquired.

The former question heing debated between Socrates, and a Sophist, Socrates
placing felicity in an equal and constan^ peace of mind; and the Sophist in
much desiring, and much enjoying: they fell from Argument to ill words: The
Sophist saying that Socrates felicity, was the felicity of a block or stone,
and Socrates saying that the Sophists felicity, was the felicity of one that
had the itch, who did nothing but itche and skratch. And both these opinions,
do not want their supports. For the opinion of Socrates is much vpheld by the
general consent, even of the Epicures themselves, that virtue bears a great
part in felicity: and if so, certain it is, that virtue has more use in
clearing perturbations, then in compassing desires. The Sophists opinion is
much favored, by the Assertion we last spoke of, that good of Advancement, is
greater then good of simple Preservation: because, every obtaining a desire,
has a show of advancement, as mocion though in a Circle, has a show of
progression.

But the second question, decided the true way, makes the former superfluous.
For, can it be doubted, but that there are some, who take more pleasure in
enjoying pleasures, then some other; and yet nevertheless, are less troubled
with the loss or leaving of them? So as this same; Non vti, vt non appetas:
Non appetere, vt non metuas, sunt animi pusilli and diffidentis. And it seems
to me, that most of the doctrines of the Philosophers are more fearful and
cautionary then the Nature of things requires. So have they increased the
fear of death, in offering to cure it. For, when they would have a man's whole
life, to be but a discipline or preparation to dye: they must needs make men
think, that it is a terrible Enemy, against whom there is no end of preparing.
Better says the Poet,

Qui sinem vitae extremum inter Munera ponat
Naturae:
So have they sought to make men's minds to uniform and harmonicall, by not
breaking them sufficiently to contrary Motions: the reason whereof, I suppose
to be, because they themselves were men dedicated, to a pri uate, free, and
vnapplied course of life. For, as we see, upon the lute, or like Instrument, a
Ground, though it be sweet, and have show of many changes, yet breaks not the
hand to such strange and hard stoppes and passages, as a Set song, or
Voluntary: much after the same Manner was the diversity between a
Philosophical and a civil life. And therefore men are to Imitate the wisdom
of Iewellers, who, if there be a grain, or a cloud, or an ise which may be
ground forth, without taking to much of the stone, they help it: but, if it
should lessen and abate the stone to much they will not meddle with it: So
ought men, so to procure Serenity, as they destroy not magnanimity.

Having therefore deduced the Good of Man, which is private and particular, as
far as seems fit: we will now return to that Good of man, which respects
and be beholds Society which we may term Duty; because the term of duty is
more propper to a mind well framed and disposed toward others, as the term
of virtue is applied to a mind well formed and composed in it self, though
neither can a man understand virtue without some relation to Society, nor duty
without an inward disposition, This part may seem at first to pertain to
Science Civil and Politic: but not if it be well observed, For it concerns
the Rcgime^t and government of every man, over himself, and not over others.
And as in architectur, the direction of framing the posts beams and other
parts of building is not the same with the manner of joining them and erecting
the building: And in mechanicalls, the direction how to frame an Instrument or
Engyne, is not the same with the manner of setting it on work and employing
it: and yet nevertheless in expressing of the one, you incidently express the
Aptness toward the other: So the doctrine of Conjugation of men in Socyety,
differereth from that of their conformity thereunto.

This part of Duty is sudiuided into two parts: the common duty of every man,
as a Man or member of a State: The other the respective or special duty of
every man in his prosession vocation and place: The first of these, is exta^t
and well labored as hathbeen said. The second like wise I may report rather
dispersed the^ dcficie^t: which manner of dispersed writing in this kind of
Argument, I acknowledge to be best. For who ca^ take upon him to write of the
proper duty, virtue cha and right, of every several vocation profession, and
place. For although sometimes a Looker on may see more then a gamester and
there be a Proverb more arrogant theu sound That the vale best discovers the
hill: yet there is small doubt but that men can write best and most really and
materialy in their own professions: and that the writing of speculatiue men of
Active Matter, for the most part does seem to men of Experience as Phormioes
Argument of the wars seemed to Hannibal, to be but dreams and dotage, Only
there is one vice which accompanies them, that write in their own professions
that they magnify the^ in excess, But generally it were to be wished, (as that
which would make learning indeed solid and fruit full) that Active men woold or
could become writers

In which kind I cannot but mention Honoris causa your Majesty's exellent book
touching the duty of a king: a work ritchlye compounded of Divinity Morality
and Policy, with great aspersion of all other arts: and being in mine opinion
one of the most sound and healthful writings that I have read: not distempered
in the heat of invention nor in the Couldnes of negligence: not sick of
Dusinesse as those are who leese themselves in their order; nor of Convulsions
as those which Crampe in matters impertinent: not savoring of perfumes and
paintings as those do who seek to please the Reader more then Nature bears,
and chiefelye well disposed in the spirits thereof, being agreeable to truth,
and apt for action: and far removed from that Natural insirmity, whereunto
I noted those, that write in their own professions to be subject, which is,
that they exalt it above measure. For your Majesty has truly described, not a
king of Assyria, or Persia, in their extern glory: but a Moses, or a David,
Pastors of their people. Neither can I ever leese out of my remembrance, what
I heard your Majesty, in the same sacred spirit of Government, deliver, in a
great cause of Judicature which was: That Kings ruled by their laws, as God
did by the laws of Nature, and ought as rarely to put in use their supreme
Prerogative, as God does his power of working Miracles. And yet
notwithstandiug, in your book of a free Monarchy, you do well give men to
understand, that you know the plenitude of the power and right of a King, as
well as the Circle of his office and duty. Thus have I presumed to allege this
excellent writing of your Majesty, as a prime or eminent example of Tractates,
concerning special and respective duties: wherein I should have said as much,
if it had been written a thousand years since: Neither am I moved with cer
tain Courtly decencyes, which esteem it flattery to praise in presence. No, it
is flattery to praise in absence: that is, when either the virtue is absent, or
the occasion is absent: and so the praise is not Natural, but forced, either
in truth, or in time. But let Cicerobe read in his Oration pro Marcello, which
is nothing but an excellent Table of Caesar's virtue, and made to his face,
besides the example of many other excellent per sons, wiser a great deal then
such obseruers: and we will never doubt, upon a full occasion, to give just
praises to present or absent.

But to return, there belongs further, to the handling of this party
touching the duties of professions and vocations a Relative or opposite
touching the frauds cautels, impostures, and vices of every profession, which
has been likewise handled. But how? rather in a Satyr and Cinicaly, then
seriously and wisely for men have rather sought by wit to deride and traduce
much of that which is good in professions then with Judgment to discover and
sever that which is corrupt. For as Solomon says. He that comes to seek
after knowledge with a mind to scorn and censure, shall be sure to find matter
for his humor but no matter for his Instruction. Quaerenti derisori Scientiam,
ipsa se abscondit: sed Studioso sit obuiam. But the managing of this argument
with integrity and Truth, which I note as deficient, seems to me to be one
of the best fortifications for honesty and virtue that can be planted. For, as
the fable goes of the Basilisk, that if he see you first you die for it: but
if you see him first, he dies. So is it with deceits and evil arts: which if
they be first espied they leese their life, but if they prevent they endanger.
So that we are much beholden to Macciauell and others that write what men do
and not what they ought to do. For it is not possible to ioyn serpentine
wisdom with the Columbine Innocence, except men know exactly all the
conditions of the Serpent: his baseness and going upon his bellye, his
volubility, and lubrioity his envy and stinge, and the rest, that is al fourmes
and Natures of evil For without this virtue lies open and unfenced. Nay an
honest man can do no good upon those that are wicked to reclaim them,
without the help of the knowledge of evil. For me^ of corrupted minds
presuppose, that honesty grows out of Simplicitye of manners, and believing of
Preachers, schoolmasters, and Men's exterior language. So as, except you can
make them perceive, that you know the vt most reaches of their own corrupt
opinions, they despise all moralitye. Non recipit stultus verba prudentiae,
nisi ca dixeris, quae versantur in Cord eius.

Unto this part touching Respective duty, does also appertain the duties
between husband and wife, parent and child, Master and Servant. So likewise,
the laws of friendship and Gratitude, the civil bond of Companyes, Colleges,
and Politic bodies, of neighborhood, and all other proportionate duties: not
as they are parts of Government and Society, but as to the framing of the mind
of particular persons.

The knowledge concerning good respecting Society does handle it also not
simply alone but Comparatively whereunto belongs the weighing of duties,
between person and person, Case and Case, particular and public: As we see in
the proceeding of Lucius Brutus, against his own Sons, which was so much
extolled yet what was said?

Inf^lix, vt cunque serent easata Minores.

So the case was doubtful, and had opinion on both sides: Again we see, when
M. Brutus and Cassius invited to a supper certain, whose opinions they meant
to feel, whether they were fit to be made their Associates, and cast forth
the question touching the Killing of a Tyra^t being an usurper they were divided
in opinion, some holding, that Servitude was the Extreme of Evils; and others,
that Tyranny was better, then a Civil war: and a number of the like cases
there are, of co^paratiue duty. Amongst which, that of all others, is the most
frequent, where the question is of a great deal of good to ensue of a small
Injustice. Which Jason of Thessalia determined against the truth; Aliqua sunt
unjust sacienda, vt multa just fieri possint. But the reply is good; Authorem
praesentis Iustititiae habes; sponsorem futurae non habes; Men must pursue
things which are just in present, and leave the future to the divine
providence: So then we pass on from this general part touching the Exemplar
and description of Good.

Now therefore, that we have spoken of this fruit of life, it remains to
speak of the Husbandry that belongs thereunto, without which part, the
former De cultura, Animi.
seems to be no better then a fair Image, or statua, which is beautiful to
contemplate, but is without life and mocion: whereunto Aristotle himself
subscribeth in these words: Necesse est scilicet de virtute dicere, and quid
sit, and ex quibus gignatur. Inutile enim sere suerit, virtutem quidem nosse,
acquirendae autem eius modos and vias ignorare Non enim de virtute tantum, qua
specie sit, quaerendum est, sed and quomodo sui copiam faciat, vtrunque enim
volumus, et rem ipsam nosse and eius compotes fieri: Hoc autem ex voto non
succedet, nisi sciamus and ex quibus and quo modo. In such full words and with
such iteration does he inculcate this part: So says Cicero in great
Commendation of Cato the second, that he he had applied him self to Philosophy.
Non ita disputandi Causa, sed ita viuendi. And although the neglect of our
times wherein few men do houlde any Consultations touching the reformation of
their life (as Seneca excellently says, Departibus vitae quisque deliberat,
de summa nemo) may make this part seem superfluous: yet I must Conclude with
that Aphorism of Hypocrates, Qui graui morbo correpti dolores non sentiunt, ijs
men's aegrotat. They need medicine not only to assuage the disease but to
awake the sense And if it be said, that the cure of men's Minds belongs to
sacred divinity, it is most true: But yet Moral Philosophy may be preferred
unto her as a wise servant, and humble handmaide. For as the Psalm says,
That the eyes of the bandmayde look perpetually toward the mistress, and
yet no doubt many things are left to the discretion of the handmayde, to
discern of the mistress will: So ought Moral Philosophy to give a constant
attention to the doctrines of Divinity, and yet so as it may yield of her self
(within due limits) Many sound and profitable directions.

This Part therefore, because of the excellency thereof, I cannot but find
exceeding strange, that it is not reduced to written enquiry, the rather
because it consists of much matter, wherein both speech and action is often
conversant, and such wherein the common talk of men (which is rare, but yet
comes sometimes to pass) is wiser then their Books: It is reasonable
therefore that we propound it in the more particularity, both for the
worthiness, and because we may acquit our selves for reporting it deficie^t,
which seems almost incredible, and is otherwise conceived and presupposed by
those themselves, that have written. We will therefore enumerate some heads or
Points thereof, that it may appear the better what it is, and whether it be
extant.

First therefore in this, as in all things, which are practical, we ought to
cast up our account, what is in our power, and what not: for the one may be
dealte with by way of alteration, but the other by way of application only.
The husbandman cannot command, neither the Nature of the Earth, nor the seasons
of the weather: no more can the Physician the constitution of the patiente, nor
the varietye of Accidents. So in the Culture and Cure of the mind of Man, two
things are without our command: Points of Nature, and points of Fortune.
For to the Basis of the one, and the Conditions of the other, our work is
limited and tied. In these things therefore, it is left unto us, to proceed
by application, Vincenda est omnis fortuna serendo: and so likewise vincenda
est omnis Natura serendo. But, when that we speak of sufferinge, we do not
speak of a dull, and neglected sufferinge, but of a wise and industrious
sufferinge, which draws, and contriueth use and advantage out of that which
seems adverse and contrary; which is that property which we call, Accomodating
or Applying. Now the wisdom of Application rests principally in the exact
and distinct knowledge of the precedent state, or disposition, unto which we do
apply: for we cannot fit a garment, except we first take measure of the Body.

So then the first Article of this knowlede is to set down Sound and true
distributions and descriptions of the several characters and tempers of men's
Natures and dispositions specially having regard to those differences which are
most radical in being the fountayns and Causes of the rest or most frequent in
Concurrence or Commixture; wherein it is not the handling of a few of them in
passage the better to describe the Mediocrities of virtues that can satisfy
this intention for if it deserve to be considered That there are minds which
are proportioned to great mattes, and others to small, (Which Aristotle handles
or ought to have handled by the name of Magnaminity) does it not deserve as
well to be Considered. That there are minds proportioned to intend many
matters and others to few? So that some can divide them selves others can
perchance do exactly well, but it must be but in few things at once; And so
there comes to be a Narrownes of mind as well as a Pusillanimity. And again,
That some minds are proportioned to that which may be dispatched at once or
within a short return of time: others to that which begins a far of, and is
to be won with length of pursuit, -- Iam tu^ tenditque fo^etque; So that there
may be fitly said to be a long animity which is Commonly also ascribed to God as
a Magnanimity. So further deserved it to be consideted, by Aristotle That there
is a disposition in Conversation (supposing it in things which do in no sort
tonch or concern a man's self) to soothe and please; And a disposition
contrary to Contradict and Cross; And deserves it not much better to be
considered, That there is a disposition, not in conversation or talk, but in
matter of mere serious Nature (and supposing it still in things merely
indifferent) to take pleasure in the good of another, and adisposition
contrariwise, to take distaste at the good of another; which is that properly,
which we call good Nature, or ill Nature, benignity or Malignity: And therefore
I cannot sufficiently Maruayle, that this part of knowledge touching the
several Characters of Natures and dispositions should be omitted both in
Morality and policy, considering it is of so great Ministry, and suppeditation
to them both A man shall find in the traditions of Astrology, some pretty and apt
divisions of men's Natures according to the predominances of the Planets; Lovers
of Quiet Lovers of action, lovers of victory, lovers of Honor, lovers of
pleasure, lovers of Arts, lovers of Change, and so forth: A man shall find in
the wisest sort of these Relations, which the Italians make touching Conclaues,
the Natures of the several Cardinals, handsomlye and lively painted fourth: A
man shall meet with in every days Conference the denominations of Sensitive,
dry, formal, real, humorous, certain, Humo di Prima impressione, Huomo di
vltima impressione, and the like, and yet nevertheless this kind of
observations wandreth in words, but as not fixed in Enquiry. For the
distinctions are found (many of them) but we conclude no precepts upon them,
wherein our fault is the greater, because both History, Poesye, and daily
experience are as goodly fields where these observations grow, whereof we make
a few poesies, to hold in our hands, but no man brings them to the
confectionary, that Receipts might be made of them for use of life.

Of much like kind are those impressions of Nature, which are imposed upon the
Mind by the Sex, by the Age, by the Region, by health, and sickness, by beauty
and deformity, and the like, which are inherent, and not externe: and again
those which are caused by extern fortune: as Soueraygnty, Nobility, obscure
birth, riches, want, Magistracye, priuatenesse, prosperity, adversity,
Constant fortune, variable fortune, rising per saltum, per gradus, and the
like: And therefore we see, that Plautus makes it a wonder, to see an oulde
man beneficent, Benignitas huius vt adolescentuli est: Saint Paul concludes
that severity of discipline was to be used to the Cretans, Increpa eos dure,
upon the disposition of their Country Cretenses semper mendaces, malae Bestiae,
ventres pigri. Salust notes, that it is usual with Kings to desire
Contradictoryes, sed plerunque Regiae voluntates, vt vehementes sunt, fic
mobiles, saepeque ipsae sibi aduersae. Tacitus observes how rarely-raising of
the fortune mendeth the disposition, solus Vespas^anus, mutatus in melius,
Pindarus makes an observation, that great and sudden fortune for the most
part defeateth men Qui magnam foelicitatem concoquere non possunt: So the
Psalm shows it is more easy to keep a measure in the enjoying of fortune,
then in the increase of fortune. Diuitiae si affluant, nolite Cor apponere:
These observations and the like, I deny not, but are touched a little by
Aristotle as in passage in his Rhetoricks, and are handled in some scattered
discourses, but they were never incorporate into Moral Philosophy, to which
they do essentiallye appertain: as the knowledge of the diuersitye of grounds
and Mouldes does to Agriculture, and the knowledge of the diversity of
Complexions and Constitutions does to the Physician; except we mean to follow
the indiscretion of Empe riques, which minister the same medicines to all
patients.

Another Article of this knowledge is the Inquirye touching the affections: for
as in Medicining of the body it is in order first to know the diverse
Complexions and constitutions, secondlye the diseases, and lastly the Cures:
So in medicining of the Mind, after knowledge of the diverse Characters of men's
natures, it follows in order to know the diseases and infirmites of the mind,
which are no other the^ the perturbations and distempers of the affections. For
as the aunciente in politiques in populer Estates were wont (...) to Compare
the people to the sea, and the Orators to the winds because as the sea would of
it self be caulm and quiet, if the winds did not move and trouble it; so the
people would be peaceable and tractable if the seditious ora tors did not set
them in working and agitation. So it may be fitly said, that the mind in the
nature thereof would be temperate and stayed, if the affections as winds, did
not put it into tumulte and perturbation. And here again I find strange, as
before, that Aristotle should have written diverse volumes of Ethiques, and
never handled the affections, which is the principal subject thereof, and yet
in his Retoricks where they are considered but collaterally, and in a second
degree, (as they may be moved by speech) he finds place for them, and
ha^dleth them well for the quantity but where their true place is, he
pretermitteth them. For it is not his disputations about pleasure and pain
that can satisfy this inquiry, no more then he that should generally handle
the nature of light can be said to handle the nature of Colors: for pleasure
and pain are to the particular affections as light is to particular colors:
Better travails I suppose had the Stoics taken in this argument, as far as I
can gather by that which we have at second hand: But yet it is like, it was
after their manner rather in subtiltye of definitions (which in a subject of
this nature are but curiosities) then in active and ample descriptions and
observations: so likewise I find some particular writings of an elegant nature
touching some of the affections, as of Auger, of Comfort upon adverse
accidents, of Tenderness of Countenance and other. But the poets and writers
of Histories are the best Doctors of this knowledge, where we may find painted
fourth with great life, How affections are kindled and incyted: and how
pacified and refrai ned: and how again Contained from Act, and further degree:
how they disclose themselves, how they work how they varye, how they gather and
fortify, how they are inwrapped one within another, and how they do fight
and encounter one with another, and other the like particularityes: Amongst the
which this last is of special use in Moral and Civil matters: how I say to
set affection against affection, and to Master one by another, even as we
use to hunt beast with beast, and fly bird with bird, which otherwise
percase we could not so easily recover: upon which foundation is erected that
excellent use of Praemium and pana. whereby Civil states Consist, employing
the predominante affections of fear and hope, for the suppressing and
brideling the rest. For as in the gouernemente of states, it is sometimes
necessary to bridle one faction with another, so it is in the gouernmente
within.

Now Come we to those points which are within (...) our own command and have
force and operacion upon the mind to affect the will and Appetite and to alter
Manners: wherein they ought to have handled Custom Exercise, Habit, Educacion,
example, Imitation, Emulation Company, Frinds, praise, Reproof, exhortation,
fame, laws, Books, studyes: these as they have determinate use, in
moraliryes, from these the mind suffers, and of these are such receipts and
Regiments compounded and described, as may seem to recover or preserve the
health and Good estate of the mind, as far as pertains to humane Medycine:
of which number we will visit upon some one or two as an example of the rest,
because it were too long to prosecute all; and therefore we do resume Custom
and habit to speak of.

The opinion of Aristotle seems to me a negligent opinion. That of those
things which consist by nature, nothing can be changed by custom, using for
example: That if a stone be thrown ten thousand times. up, it will not learn
to assend, and (...) that by, often seeing or hearing, we do not learn to
see or hear the better. For though this principle be true in things wherein
nature is Peremptory (the reason whereof we cannot now stand to discuss) yet
it is otherwise in things wherein nature admits a latitude. For he moughtsee
that a straight glove will come more easily on with use, and that a wand will by
use bend otherwise then it grew: and that by use of the voice we speak
louder and stronger, and that by use of enduring heat or could, we endure it
the better, and the like: which later sort have a nearer resemblance unto that
subject of Manners he handles then those insta^ces which he alleges; But
allowing his Conclusion that virtues and vices consist in habit, he ought so
much the more to have taught the manner of superinducing that habit: for there
be many precepts of the wise ordering the exercises of the mind, as there is
of ordering the exercises of the body, whereof we will recite a few.

The first shall be, that we beware we take not at the first either to High a
strain or to weak: for if, too High in a different nature you discorage, in
a confident nature, you breed an opinion of facility, and so a sloth, and in
all natures you breed a further expectation then can hold out, and so an
insatisfaction on the end, if to weak of the either side: you may not look to
perform and overcome any great task.

Another precept is to practice all things chiefly at two several times, the
one when the mind is best disposed, the other when it is worste disposed: that
by the one you may gain a great step, by the other you may work out the knots
and Stondes of the mind, and make the middle times the more easily and pleasant.

Another precept is, that which Aristotle mencioneth by the way, which is to
bear ever toward the Contrary extreme of that whereunto we are by Nature
inclyned: like unto the Rowing against the stream or making a wand straight by
bynding him Contrary to his natural Crookedness.

Another precept is, that the mind is brought to any thing better and with more
sweetness and happiness, if that whereunto you pretend be not first in the
intention but Tanqua^ aliud agendo, because of the Natural hatred of the mind
against necessity and Constraint. Many other Axioms there are touching the
Managing of Exercise and custom: which being so Conducted, does prove indeed
another nature: but being governed by chance, does commonly prove but an ape
of nature, and brings forth that which is lame and Counterfette.

So if we should handle books and studies and what influence and operation
they have upon manners, are there not diverse precepts of great caution and
direction appertaining thereunto? did not one of the fathers in great
indignation call Poesy vinum Demonum, because it increases temptations,
perturbations and vain opinions? Is not the opinion of Aristotle worthy to be
regarded wherein he says, That young men are no fit auditors of Moral
Philosophy, because they are not settled from the boiling heat of their
affections, nor attempered with Time and experience? and does it not hereof
come that those excellent books and discourses of the aunciente writers,
(whereby they have persuaded unto virtue most effectually, by representing her
in state and Majesty; and populer opinions against virtue, in their Parasites
Coats, fit to be scorned and derided,) are of so little effect toward
honesty of life, because they are not red and reuolued by me^ in their mature
and settled years, but confined almost to boys and beginners? But is it not
true also, that much less, young men are fit auditors of Matters of Policy,
till they have been thoroughly seasoned in religion and Morality, least their
Judgments be corrupted, and made apt to think that there are no true
Differences of things, but according to vtility and fortune, as the verse
describes it. Prosperum et Foelix scelus virtus vocatur: And Again Ille crucem
pretium sceleris tulit, Hic diadema: which the Poets do speak satyrically and
in indignation on virtues behalf: But books of pollicre do speak it
seriously, and positiuely, for so it pleases Machiauell to say That if Caesar
had been overthrown, he would have been more odious then ever was Catiline;
as if there had been noe difference but in fortune, between a very fury of
lust and blood, and the most excellent spirit (his ambicio^ reserved) of the
world? Again is there not a Caution likewise to be given of the doctrines of
Moralities themselves (some kinds of the^) least they make men too precise,
arroga^t, inco^patible, as Cicero says of Cato in Marco Catone. Haec bona quae
videmus diuina and egregia ipsius scitote esse propria: quae nonnunquam
requirimus, ea, sunt omnia, non a natura sed a Magistro? Many other Axioms and
aduises there are touching those proprieties and effects, which studies do
infuse and instill into manners: And so likewise is there touching the use of
all those other points of Company: fame, laws and the rest, which we recited
in the beginning in the doctrine of Morality.

But there is a kind of CVLTVRE of the MIND; that seems yet more accurate and
elaborate the^ the rest and is built upon this ground: That the minds of all
men are at some times in a state more perfect, and at oother times in a state
more depraved. The purpose therefore of this practice is to fix and cherishe
the good hours of the mind and to obliterate and take fourth the Evil: The
fixing of the good has been practiced by two means, vows or Constant
resolutions, and obseruances, or exercises which are not to be regarded so much
in themselves, as because they keep the mind in continual obedience. The
obliteratio^ of the Evil has been practiced by two Means, some kind of
Redemption or expiation of that which is past, and an Inception or account de
Nouo, for the time to come: but this part, seems sacred and religious, and
Justly: for all good Moral Philosophy (as was said,) is but an handmaide to
Religion.

Wherefore we will conclude with that last point which is of all other means
the most compendious and summarye, and again, the most noble and effectual
to the reducing of the mind unto virtue and good estate: which is the electing
and propounding unto a man's self good and virtuous ends of his life, such as
may be in a reasonable sort within his Compass to attain. For if these two
things be sup osed: that a maset before him honest and Good ends, and again
that he be resolute, Constant, and true unto them; it will follow that he
shall Moulde himself into al virtue at once: and this is indeed like the
work of nature; whereas the other course, is like the work of the hand. For
as when a caruer makes an image, he shapes only that part whereupon he
works, as if he be upon The face that part which shall be the body is but
a rude stone still, til such times as he comes to it. But contrariwise when
Nature makes a flower or living creature, she fourmeth rudiments of all the
parts at one time; so in obtaining ver tue by habit, while a man practices
Temperance, he does not profit much to fortitude, nor the like; But when he
dedicateth and applies himself to good ends, look what virtue soever the
pursuit and passage toward those ends does commend unto him, he is invested of
a precedent disposition to conform himself thereunto: which state of mind
Aristotle does exexcellently express himself, that it ought not to be called
virtuous, but Divine: his words are these; Immanitati autem consentaneum est,
opponere eam, quae supra humanitatem est, heroica^ sieve diuinam virtutem. And a
little after; Na^ vt ferae, neque vitiu^, neque virtus est sic neque Dei. Sed
hic quide^ status altius quidda^ virtute est, ille aliud quidda^ a vitio. And
therefore we may see what Celsitud of honor Piinius secundus attributes to
Traiane in his funeral oration, where he said. That men needed to make noe
other prayers to the Gods, but that they would Continue as good Lords to them,
as Traiaine had been: as if he had not been only an Imitation of divine
nature, but a pattern of it. But these be heathen and profane passages having
but a shadow of that divine state of mind, which Religion and the holy faith
does conduct men unto; by imprinting upon their souls Charity which is
exelle^tly called the bond of Perfection: because it co^prehe^deth and fastneth
al virtues together. And it is elegantly said by Menander of vain love which
is but a false Imitation of divine love. Amor melior Sophista, Lauo, ad humanam
vitam, that Love teaches a man to Carry himself better, then the Sophist or
Praeceptor, which he calls Left handed, because with all his rules and
preceptio^s he cannot form a man so Dexteriously, nor with that facility to
prize himself and govern himself as love ca^ do: So certainly if a ma^s mind be
truly inflamd with charity it does work himsodainly into greter perfection then
all the Doctrine of moralitye can do, which is but a sophist in comparison of
the other. Nay further as Xenophon observed truly that all other affections
though they raise the mind, yet they do it by distorting, and uncomeliness of
ecstasies or excesses; but only Love does exalt the mind, and nevertheless; at
the same instant does settle and Compose it. So in all other excellencyes
though they advance nature yet they are subject to Excess. Only Charity
admits noe Excess; for so we see, aspiring to be like God in power, the
Angels transgressed and fell: Ascendam, and ero simitis altissimo: By aspiringe
to be like God in knowledge man transgressed and fell. Eritis sicut Dii
scientes bouum and malum; But by aspiring to a similitude of God in goodness
or love, neither Man nor Angel ever transgressed or shall transgress. For
unto that imitation we are called, Diligite inimicos vestros, Benefacite eis
qui odernut vos, and orate pro persequentibus and Calumniantibus vos, vt sitis
filii patris vestri qui in coelis est, qui solemn suum oriri facit super bonos
and malos, and pluit super iustos and iniustos. So in the first platfourme of
the divine Nature it self, the heathen Religion speaks thus, Optimus Maximus,
and the sacred scriptures thus, Misericordia eius super omnia opera eius.

Wherefore I do conclude this part of Moral knowledge concerning the Culture
and Regiment of the Mind, wherein if any man considering the parts thereof, which
I have enumerated, do judge, that my labor is but to Collect into an Art or
Science, that which has bin pretermitted by others, as matter of common Sense,
and experience, he judges well: But as Philocrates sported with Demosthenes:
you may not marvel (A thenians) that Demosthenes and I do differ, for he
drinks water, and I drink wine: and like as we read of an aunciente
parable of the two gates of sleep.

Sunt geminae somni portae, quarum altera fertur
Cornea, qua veris facilis datur exitus vmbris:
Altera Candenti perfecta nitens Elephanto,
Sed falsa ad coelum mittunt insomnia manes.
So if we put on sobriety and attention, we shall find it a sure Maxim in
knowledge: that the more pleasant Liquor (of Wine) is the more vaporous, and
the brauer gate of Iuorye, sends forth the falser dreams.

But we have now concluded, That general part of Humane Philosophye, which
contemplateth man segregate, and as he consists of body and spirit;
Wherein we may further note, that there there seems to be a Relation or
Conformity between the good of the mind, and the good of the Body. For as we
divided the good of the body into Health, Beau ty, strength, and Pleasure, so
the good of the mind inquired in Rational and Moral knoweledges tends to
this, to make the mind sound, and without perturbation, Beautiful and graced
with decency: and Strong and Agill for all duties of life. T^eis three as in
the body, so in the mind seeldome meet, and Commonly sever: For it is
easilye to observe, that many have Strength of wit and Courage, but have
neither Health from perturbations, nor any Beauty or decency in their
doings: some again have an Elegancy and finenesse of Carriage, which have
neither soundness of honesty, nor substance of sufficiencye: And some again
have honest and reformed Minds that can neither become themselves nor Manage
Business, and sometimes two of them meet, and rarely all three: As for
pleasure, we have likewise determined, that the mind ought not to be
reduced to stupide, but to retain pleasure: Confined rather in the subject of
it, then in the strength and vigor of it.

CIVIL KNOWLEDGE is conversant about a subject which of all others is most
immersed in matter, and hardliest reduced to Actiome. Nevertheless, as Cato
the Censor said, That the Roman; were like sheep, for that a man were better
drive a flock of them, then one of them; For in a flock, if you could get but
some few go right, the rest would follow: So in that respect Moral
philosophy is more difficile then Policy. Again, morrall Philosophye
propounds to it self the framing of Internal goodness: But civil
knowledge requires only an External goodness: for that as to societye
suffices: And therefore it comes often to pass that therebe Evil Times in good
governments: for so we find in the holy story when the kings were good, yet it
is added. Sed adhuc populus non dixerat cor suum ad dominum Deumpatrum suorum.
Again States as great Engines move slowly, and are not so soon put out of
frame: for as in Egypt the seaue^ good years sustained the seven badde: So
governments for a time well grounded do bear out errors following. But the
resolution of particular persons is more so dainly sub verted. These respects
do somewhat qualify the extreme difficulty of ^iuile knowledge.

This knowledge has three parts according to the three summary Actions of
society, which are, Co^versation, Negotiatio^ and Government. For man seeks
in society comfort, use and Protection: and theybe three wisedo^s of diverse
natures, which do often sever: wisdom of the behavior, wisdom of Business;
and wisdom of state.

The wisdom of of conversation ought not to be over mvch affected, but much
less despised: for it has not only an honor in it self, but an influence
also into business and government; The poet says.

Nec vultu destrue verba tuo. A man may destroy the force of his words with
his countenance: so may he^ of his deeds says Cicero, recommending to his
brother affability and easy access, Nil interest habere ostium apertum, vultum
clausum.

It is nothing won to admit men with an open door, and to receive them
with a shut and reserved countenance. So we see Atticus, before the first
interuiewe between Coesar and Cicero, the war depending, did seriouslye
advise Cicero touching the composing and orderinge of his countenance and
gesture. And if the gouernemente of the countenance be of such effect, much
more is that of the speech, and other carriage appertayning to conversation;
the true modele whereof seems to me well expressed by Ltuye, though not
meante for this purpose; Ne aut arrogans videar, aut obnoxious, quorum alterum
est alienae libertatis obliti, alterum suae: The sum of behauioure is to
retain a man's own dignitye, without intruding upon the liberty of others: on
the other side, if behauioure and outward carriage be intended too much,
first it may pass into affection, and then Quid deformius quam Scaenam in
vitam transfer, to act a man's life? But although it proceed not to that
extreme, yet it consumes time, and imployeth the mind too much. And
therefore as we use to advise young students from company keeping, by
saying, Amici, sures Temporis: So certainly the Intending of the discretion of
behauioure is a great Thief of Meditation: Again, such as are accomplished in
that howr of vrbanity, please themselves in name, and sildome aspire to higher
virtue: whereas those that have defect in it, do seek Comlines by Reputation:
for where reputacion is, almost every thing becomes: But where that is not,
it must be supplied by Puntos and Complementes: Again, there is no greater
impediment of Action, then an ouercurious obseruaunce of decency, and the guide
of decencye, which is Time and season. For as Solomon says, Qui respicit ad
ventos, non seminat, and qui respicit ad nubes, non metet: A man must make his
opportunity, as often as find it. To conclude; Behavior seems to me as a
Garment of the Mind, and to have the Conditions of a Garmente. For it ought to
be made in sashion: it ought not to be too curious: It ought to be shaped
so, as to set forth any good making of the mind: and hide any deformity;
and above all, it ought not to be too straighte, or restrained for exercise or
mocion. But this part of Civil knowledge has been elegantlye handled, and
therefore I cannot report it for deficient.

The wisdom touching Negotiation or business has not bin hitherto collected
into writing to the great derogacion of learning, and the professors of
learning. For from this root springs chiefly that note or opinion which by
us is expressed in Adage, to this effect: That there is noe great concurrence
between learning and Wisdom. For of the three wisdoms which we have set
down to pertain to civil life, for wisdom of Behavior, it is by learned
men for the most part despised, as an Inferior to Virtue and and an Enemy to
Meditacion; for wisdom of Gouernmente they acquit themselves well when they
are called to it, but that happens to few. But for the wisdom of Business
wherein man's life is most conversant, there be noe Books of it, except some
few scattered aduertisementes, that have noe proportion to the magnitude of
this subject. For if books were written of this, as the other, I doubt not
but learned men with mean experience, would far excel men of long
experience without learning, and outshoote them in their own bow.

Neither needs it at all to be doubted, that this knowlddge should be so
variable as it falls not under precept; for it is much less infinite then
science of Gouernmente, which we see is labored and in some part reduced. Of
this wisdom it seems some of the ancient Romans in the saddest and wisest
times were professors: for Cicero reports, that it was then in use. For
Senators that had name and opinion, for general wisemen as Ceruncanius,
Curious, Loelius and many others; to walk at certain hours in the Place, and
to give audience to those that would use their advise, and that the particular
Citizens would resort unto them, and consulte with them of the marriage of a
daughter, or of the employing of a son, or of a purchase or bargain, or of
an accusation and every other occasion incident to man's life; so as there is a
wisdom of Counsel and advise even in private Causes: arisinge out of an
universal insight into the affayrs of the world, which is used indeed upon
particular cases propounded, but is gathered by general obser, uation of
causes of like nature. For so we see in the Book which Cicero writes to his
brother De petitione consultatus, (being the only book of business that I
know written by the ancients) although it co^cerned a particular action then
on foot, yet the substance thereof consists of many wise and pollitique
Axioms which contain not a temporary, but a perpetual direction in the case
of popular Elections; But chiefly we may see in those Aphorisms which have
place amongst Divine writings composed by Solomon the King, of whom the
scriptures testify that his heart was as the sands of the sea, incompassing
the world and all worldly matters we see I say, not a few profound and
excellent cautions, precepts, positions, extending to much variety of
occasions; whereupon we will stay a while offering to consideracion some
number of Examples.

Sed and eunctis sermonibus qui dicuntur, ne accommodes aurem tuam, ue forte
audiaes seruum tuum maledicentem tibi. Here is concluded the prouidente stay
of enquiry, of that which we would be loathe to find: as it was judged great
wisdom in Pompetus Magnus that he burned Sertorius papers vnperused.

Vir sapiens si cum stulto contenderit, sieve irascaetur, sieve rideat, uon
inueniet requiem. Here is described the great disadvantage which a wise man
has in undertaking a lighter person then himself, which is such an
ingagemente, as whether a man turn the matter to jest, or turn it to heat;
or howsoever he change copye, he can no ways quitte himself well of it.

Qui delicate a pueritia nutrit seruum suum, postea sentiet eum contumacem.
Here is signified that if a man begin too high a pitche in his favors, it
does commonly end in unkindness, and unthankfulness.

Vidisti virum velocem in opere suo, coram regibus stabit nec erit inter
ignobiles. Here is observed that of all virtues for rising to honor,
quickness of dispatche is the best; for superiors many times love not to have
those they employ too deep, or too sufficient, but ready and diligent.

Vidi cunctos viuentes, qui ambulant sub sole cum adoadolescente secundo qui
consurgit pro eo. Here is expressed that which was noted by Sylla first, and
after him by Tiberius; Plures adorant solemn orientem, quam occidentem vel
meridianum.

Si spiritus potesta^m habentis ascenderit super te, locum tuum ne dimiseris,
quia Curatio faciet cessare peccata maxima. Here caution is given that upon
displeasure, retiring is of all courses the unfittest; for a man leaves
things at worst, and depriueth himself of means to make them better.

Erat Ciuitas parua pauci in ea viri; venit contra eam rex magnus, and vadauit
eam, instrxuitque munitiones per Gyrum, and perfecta est obsidio inuentusquae
est in ea vir pauper and sapiens, and liberauit eam per sapientiam suam, and
nullus deinceps recordatus est hominis illius pauperis; Here the corruptions of
states is set foorh; that esteem not virtue or merit longer then they have
use of it.

Mollis responsio frangit iram. Here is noted that silence or rough Answer,
exasperateth: but an answer present and temperate pacifieth.

Iter pigrorum, quasisepes spinarum. Here is lively represented how laborious
sloth proves in the end; for when things are differred till the last
instant, and nothing prepared before hand, every stepp finds a Bryer or
Impediment, which catches or stops.

Melior est finis orationis quam principium. Here is taxed the vanity of
formal speakers, that study more about prefaces and inducements, then upon the
conclusions and issues of speech.

Qui cognoscit in iudicio faciem, non been facit, iste et pro buccella panis
des^ret veritatem. Here is noted that a judge were better be a briber, then a
respecter of persons: for a corrupt Judge offends not so lightly as a facile.

Vir pauper calumnians pauperes, similis est imbrivehementi, in quo paratur
fames; here is expressed the extreami^y of necessitous extortions, figured in
the aunciente fable of the full and the hungry horseleech.

Fons turbatus pede, and vena corrupta, est iustus cadens coram impio: here is
noted that one judicial and exemplar iniquity in the face of the world, does
trouble the fountains of Justice more, then many particular Injuries passed
over by conniuence.

Qui subtrahit aliquid a patre and a matre, and dicit hoc non esse peccatu^,
particeps est homicidij; here is noted that whereas men in wronging their best
frindes, use to extenuat: their fault, as if they moughte presume or be bold
upon them, it does contrariwise indeed aggrauate their fault, and turns it
from I^iury to impiety.

Noli esse amicus homini iracundo, nec ambulato cum homine furioso; here
caution is given that in the election of our friends we do principalliy
avoid those which are impatiente, as those that will espouse us to many
factions and quarrels.

Qui conturbat domum suam possidebit ventum: here is noted that in domestical
separations and breaches men do promise to themselves quietting of their
mind and contentemente, but still they are deceived of their expectation, and
it turns to wind.

Pilius sapiens laetificat patrem, filius vero stultus maestieia est matri
sueae. Here is distinguished that fathers have most comfort of the good
proose of of their sons; but mothers have most discomfort of their ill
proof, because women have little discerninge of virtue but of fortune.

Qui celat delictum quoerit amicitiam, sed qui altero sermon repetit, seperat
faederatos; here caution is given that reconcilemente is better managed by an
Amnesty and passing over that which is past, then by Apologies and excusations.

In omni opere bono erit abundantia, vbi autem verba sunt plurima, ibi
frequenter egestas: here is noted that words and discourse abounds most,
where there is idleness and want.

Primus in sua causa iustus, sed venit altera pars, and inquiret in eum, Hear

Thus have I staide some what longer upon these sentences pollitique of
Solomon, then is ag^e, able to the proportion of an example: led with a
desire to give authority to this part of knoweledge, which I noted as
deficiente by so excellent a presidente:: and have also attended them with
brief observations, such as to my understanding, offer noe violence to the
sense, though I know they may be applied to a more divine use: But it is
allowed even in divinity, that some Interpretations, yea and some writings have
more of the Eagle, then others: But taking them as Instructions for life, they
moughte have received large discourse, if I would have broken them and
illustrated them by diducements and examples.

Neither was this in use only with the hebrews, But it is generally to be found
in the wisdom of the more ancient Times: that as men sound out any
observation that they thought was good for life, they would gather it and
express it in parable. or Aphorism, or fable. But for fables they were
vicegerents and supplies, where Examples sailed: Now that the times abound
with history, the Aim is better when the mark is alive. And therefore the
form of writing which of al others is fittest for this variable argu mente of
Negotiation and occasions is that which Machiauel chose wisely and aptly for
Gouernmente: namely discourse upon Histories or Examples. For knoweledge drawn
freshly and in our view out of particulers, knows the way best to
particulers again. And it has much greater life for practice: when the
discourse attends upon the Example, then when the example attenddeth upon the
discourse. For this is no point of order as it seems at first but of
substance. For when the Example is the ground being set down in an history at
large, it is set down with all circumstances: which many sometimes control the
discourse thereupon made, and sometimes supply it; as a very pattern for
gain; whereas the Examples alleged for the discourses sake, are cited
succinctly, and with out particularity, and carry a servile aspecte toward the
discourse, which they are brought in to make good.

But this difference is not amiss to be remembered, that as historye of Times
is the best ground for discourse of Gouernemente, such as Machyauel handles;
so Histories of Lives is the most proper for discourse of business is more
conversante in private Actions. Nay, there is a ground of discourse for this
purpose, fitter then them both which is discourse upon letters, such as are
wise and weighty, as many are of Cicero ad Atticum and others. For letters
have a great and more particular representation of business, then either
Chronicles or Lives, Thus have we spoken both of the matter and form of this
patte of Civil knowledge touching Negotiation, which we note to be deficient.

But yet there is another part of this part, which differs as much from that
wherofwe have spoke as sapere, and sibi Sapere: the one moving as it were to
the circu^ rence, the other to the center: for there is awisedome of counfell,
and again there is a wisdom of pressi^ng a man's own fortune; and they do
sometimes meet, and often severe. For many are wise in their own ways, that
are weak for gouernmente or Counsel, like Ants which is a wise creature for it
self, but very huttefull for the garden- This wisdom the Romans did take
much knoweledge of, Nam polsapiens (says the Comicall Poet) Fingit fortunam
sibi, and it grew to an adage, Faber quisque fortunae propriae^ and Liver
attribu^eth it to Cato the first, In hoc viro tanta vis animi and ingenij
inerat, vt quocunque Loco natus esset sibi ipse fortunam sacturus videre tur.

This conceit or position if it be too much declared and professed, has been
thought a thing impolitique and unlucky, as was observed in Timotheus the
Athenian: who having done many great services to the Estate in his
government and giuinge an accounte thereof to the people as the manner was, did
conclude every particular with this Clause, And in this fortune had noe part
And it came so to pass that he never prospered in any thing he took in
hand afterward: for this is too high and too arrogant savouring of that which
Ezechiel says of Pharaoh: Dicis: fluuius est meus and ego feci memet ipsum: or
of that which another prophette speaks: That men offer Sacrifices to their
nets and snares, and that which the Poett expresses,. Dextra mihi Deus, and
telum quod inutile libro.

Nunc adsinte:
For these confidences were ever unhallowed, and unblessed. And therefore those
that were great Pollitiques indeed ever afcribed their succcesses to their
felicity: and not to their skill or virtue. For so Sylla surnamed himself
Foelix^, not Magnus So Caesar said to the Master of the ship, Caesarem
portas and fortunam eius.

But yet nevertheless these Positions Faber quisque fortunae suae, sapiens
dominabitur astris: Inuia virtuti nullaest via, and the like, being taken and
used as spurs to Industry, and not as stirops to insolency rather for
resolution then for the presumption or outward declaration, have been ever
thought sound and good, and are no question imprinted in the greatest minds:
who are so sensible of this opinion, as they causcarce contain it within. As
we see in Augustus Caesar) who was rather diverse from his uncle, then,
inferior in virtue) how when he died, he desiered his friends about him to
give him a Plaudite: as if he were consciente to himself that he had played
his part well upon the stage. This part of knowledge we do report also as
deficient: not but that it is practiced too much, butit has not been reduced
to writing. And therefore least it should seem to any that it is not
comprehensible by Axiom, It is requisite as we did in the former, that we
set down some Faber Fortunae sieve de Am. bitu vitae.
heads or passages of it.

Wherein it may appear at the first a new and unwonted Argument to teach
men how to raise and make their fortune a doctrine wherein every man perchance
will be ready to yield himself a disciple til he seethe difficulty: for
fortune lays as heavy impositions as virtue, and it is as hard and severe a
thing to be a true Pollipolitique, as to be truly moral. But the handlinge
hereof, concerns learning greatly, both in honor, and in substance: In
honor, because pragmaticall men may not go away with an opinion that learning
is like a Lark that can mount, and singe, and please her self, and nothing
else; but may know that she houldeth as well of the hawk that can soar
aloft, and can also descend and strike upon the pray. In substance, because it
is the perfect law of enquiry of truth, That nothing be in the globe of
matter, which should not be likewise in the globe of Crystal, or Form, that
is, that there be not any thing in being and action, which should not be
drawn and collected into contemplation and doctrine: Neither does learning
admire or esteem of this Architecture of fortune, otherwise then as of an
inferior work; For no man's fortune can be an end worthy of his being, and
many times the woorthiest men do abandon their fortune willingly for better
respects: but nevertheless fortune as an organ of virtue and merit deserves
the consideration.

First therefore the precept which I conceive to be most summary, toward the
preuayling in fortune; is to obtain that window which Momus did require, who
seeing in the frame of man's heart, such Angles and recesses, sound fault there
was not a window to look into them: that is, to procure good informacions of
particulars touching persons, their Natures, their desires and ends, their
customs and fashions, their helps and advantages, and whereby they cheesly
stand; so again their weaknesses and disaduantages, and where they lie most
open and obnoxious, their friends, factions, dependaunces: and again their
opposites, enuiors, competitors, their moods, and times, Sola viri molles
adytus, and te^poranoras their principles, rules, and obseruacions: and the
like; And this not only of persons, but of actions: what are on foot from
time to time: and how they are con ducted, favored, opposed; and how they
importe: and the like; For the knowledge of present Actions, is not only
material in itself, but without it also, the knowledge of persons is very
erroneous: for men change with the actions; and whiles they are in pursuit,
they are one, and when they return to their Nature, they are another. These
Informations of particulars, touching persons and actions, are as the minor
propositions in every active syl logisme, for no excellencye of observacions
(which are as the mayor propositions) can suffice to ground a conclusion, if
there be error and mistaking in the minors.

That this knowledge is possible, Solomon is our surety who says. Consilium
in cord viri tanquam aqua profunda, sed vir prudens exhauriet illud: And
although the knowledge it self falls not under precept, because it is of
Indiuiduals, yet the Instructions for the obtaining of it may.

We will begin therefore with this precept, according to the aunciente
opinion, that the Synewes of wisdom, are slownesse of belief, and distrust:
That more trust be given to Countenances and Deeds, then to words: and in
words, rather to sudden passages, and surprised words: then to set and
purposed words: Neither let that be feared which is said, fronti nulla fides,
which is meant of a general outward behavior, and not of the private and
subtle mocions and labors of the countenance and gesture, which as Q. Cicero
elegantly says is Animi Ianua, the gate of the Mind: None more close then
Tyberius, and yet Tacitus says of Gallus, Etenim vultu offersionem
coniectauerat. So again noting the disfering Character and manner of his
commending Germanicus and Drusus in the Senate: he says, touching his fashion
wherein he carried his speech of Germunicus, thus: Magis in fpeciem adornatis
verbis, quam vt penitus sentire crederetur, but of Drusus thus, Paucioribus sed
intentior, and fida oratione: and in another place speaking of his character of
speech, when he did any thing that was gracious and populer, he says, That in
other things he was velut eluctantium verborum: but then again, Solutius
loquebatur quando subueniret. So that there is no such artificer of
dissimulation: nor noe such commanded countenance (vulius tussus), that can
sever from a fained tale, some of these fashions, either a more slight and
careless fashion, or more set and sormall, or more tedious and wandering or
coming from, a man more drily and hardly.

Neither are Deeds such assured pledges, as that they may be trusted without a
judicious co^sideracio^ of their magnitude and nature; Fraus sibi in paruis
fidem praestruit, vt maiore emolumento sallat: and the Italian thinks
himself upon the point to be bought and sold: when he is better used then he
was wont to be without manifest cause. For small favors, they do but lull
men a sleep, both as to Caution, and as to Industry, and are as Demosthenes
calls them, Alimenta socordiae. So again we see, how false the nature of
some deeds are in that particular, which Mutianus practiced upon Antonius
Primus, upon that hollow and unfaithful reconcilement, which was made between
them: whereupon Mutianus advanced many of the friends of Antonius: Simul amicis
eius praesecturas and tribunatus largitur: wherein under pretense to strengthen
him, he did desolate him, and won from him his dependances.

As for words (though they be like waters to Physicians, full of flattery and
uncertainty) yet they are not to be despised, specially with the advantage of
passion and affection. For so we see Tyberius upon a stinging and incensing
speech of Agrippina, came a step forth of his dissimulacion when he said, You
are hurt, because you doc not reign: of which Tacitus says, Audita hec,
raram occulti pectoris voccm elicuere: correplamque Groeco versu admonuit: ideo
laedi quia non regnaret. And therefore the Poet does elegantly call passions,
tortures, that urge men to confess their secrets.

Vino tortus and ira.
And experience shows, there are few men so true to themselves, and so
settled; but that sometimes upon heat, sometimes upon brauerye, sometime: upon
kindness, sometimes upon trouble of mind and weakness, they open
themselves; specially if they be put to it with a counter-dissimulatio^,
according to the proverb of Spain, Dimentira, y sacar as verdad: Tell a lie,
and find a truth.

As for the knowing of men, which is at second hand from Reports: men's
weakness and faults are best known from their Enemies, their virtues, and
abilityes from their friends; their customs and Times from their servants:
their conceits and opinions from their familiar friends, with whom they
discourse most. General fame is light, and the opinions conceived by superiors
or equals are deceitful: for to such men are more masked, Verior sama e
domesticis emanat.

But the soundest disclosing and expounding of men is, by their natures and
ends, wherein the weakest sort of men are best interpreted by their Natures,
and the wisest by their ends. For it was both pleasauntlye and wiselye said
(though I think very untruly) by a Nuntio of the pope, returning from a
certain Nation, where he served as LIDGER: whose opinion being asked
touching the appointemente of one to go in his place, he wished that in any
case they did not send one that was too wise: because no very wise man would
ever imagine, what they in that country were like to do: And certaynelye, it
is an error frequent, for men to shoot over, and to suppose deeper ends, and
more compass reaches then are: the Italian proverb being elegant, and for the
most part true.

Di danari, di senno, e di feed,
C'n e manco che non credi:
There is commonly less money. Iesse wisdom, and less good faith, then men
do account upon: But Princes upon a far other Reason are best interpreted by
their natures, and private persons by their ends, For Princes being at the
top of humane desires, they have for the most part no particular ends,
whereto they aspire: by distaunce from which a man might take measure and
scale of the rest of their actions and desires. which is one of the causes that
makes their hearts more inscructable: Neither is it sufficient to infourme
onr selves in men's ends and natures of the variety of them only, but also of
the predominancy what humor reigns most, and what end is principally sought.
For so we see, when Tigellinus saw himself out-stripped by Petrouius
Turpilianus in Neroes humors of pleasures Metus eius rim^, he wrought upon
Neroes fears, whereby he brake the others neck.

But to all this part of Enquierie, the most compendious way rests in three
things: The first to have general acquaintance and in wardnesse with those
which have general atquaintance, and look most into the world: and
specially according to the diversity of Business, and the diuersitye of
Persons, to have priuacye and conversation with some one friend at least which
is parfite and well intelligenced in every several kind. The second is to
keep a good mediocritye in liberty of speech, and secrecy: in most things
liberty: secrecy where it imports: for liberty of speech inuiteth and
provoke liberty to be used again: and so brings much to a man's
knowledge: and secrecy on the other side induces trust and inwardnesse. The
last is the reducing of a man's self to this watchful and serene habit, as to
make account and purpose in every conference and action, as well to observe as
to act. For as Epictetus would have a Philosopher in eve ry particular action
to say to himself, Et hoc volo, and etiam institutum seruare: so a politic
man in every thing should say to himself; Et hoc volo, ac etiam aliquid
addifcere. I have stayed the longer upon thit precept of obtaining good
information, because it is a maine part by it self, which answers to all
the rest. But above al things, Caution must be taken, that Men have a good
stay and houlde of themselves, and that this much knowing do not draw on much
meddling: For nothing is more unfortunate then light and rash intermeddling in
many matters: So that this variety of knowledge tends in conclusion but only
to this, to make a better and freer choice of those actions, which may concern
us, and to conduct them with the less error and the more dexterity.

The second precept concerning this knowledge is for men to take good
informacion touching their own person and well to understand themselves: know,
ing that as S. James says, though men look often in a glass, yet they do
suddenly forget themselves, wherein as the divine glass is the word of God, so
the politic glass is the state of the world, or times wherein we live: In the
which we are to behold our selves.

For men ought to take an impartial view of their own abilities and virtues:
and again of their wants and impediments; accounting these with the most, and
those other with the least, and from this view and examination to frame the
considerations following.

First to consider how the constitution of their nature sorteth with the
general state of the times: which if they find agreeable and fit, then in all
things to give themselves more scope and liberty, but if differing and
dissonant, then in the whole course of their life to be more close retired and
reserved; as we see in Tyberius who was never seen at a play: and came not into
the Senate in 12. of his last years: whereas Augustus Caesar lived ever in men's
eyes, which Tacitus observes, Alia Tiberio morum via.

Secondly to consider how their Nature sorteth with professions and courses of
life, and accordingly to make election if they be free, and if engaged, to make
the departure at the first opportunity: as we see was done by Duke Valentine,
that was designed by his father to a sacerdotal profession, but quitted it soon
after in regard of his parts and inclination being such nevertheless, as a man
cannot tell well whether they were worse for a Prince or for a Priest.

Thirdly to consider how they sort with those whom they are like to have
Competitors and Concurrents and to take that course wherein there is most
solitude, and themselves like to be most eminent: as Caesar Julius did, who at
first was an Orator or Pleader but when he saw the excellency of Cicero,
Hortensius, Catulus, and others for eloquence, and saw there was no man of
reputation for the wars but Pompeius upon whom the State was forced to rely;
he forsook his course begun toward a civil and popular greatness; and
transgressed his designs to a marshall greatness.

Fourthly in the choice of their friends, and dependaunces, to proceeed
according to the Composition of their own nature, as we may see in Caesar, all
whose friends and followers were men active and effectual, but not solemn or
of reputation.

Fifthly to take special heed how they guide them selves by examples, in
thinking they can do as they see others do: whereas perhaps their natures
and carriages are far differing; in which Error, it seems Pompey was, of
whom Cicero says, that he was wont often to say: Sylla potuit; Ego non
potero? wherein he was much abused, the natures and proceedinges of himself
and his example, being the vnlikest in the world, the one being fierce,
violent, and pressing the fact; the other solemn, and full of Majesty and
circumstance, and therefore the less effectual. But this precept touching the
politic knowledge of our selves has many other branches whereupon we cannot
insist:

Next to the wellvnderstanding and discerning of a man's self, there follows
the well opening and revealing a man's self, wherein we see nothing more usual
then for the more able man to make the less show. For there is a great
advantage in the well setting forth of a man's virtues, fortunes, merits, and
again in the artificial covering of a man's weaknesses, defectes, disgraces,
staying upon the one slyding from the other, cherishing the one by
circumstaunces, gracing the other by exposition, and the like; wherein we see
what Tacitus says of Mutianus, who was the greatest politic of his time,
Omnium quae dixerat fecer atque, art quadam ostentator: which requires indeed
some art, least it turn tedious and arrogant, but yet so; as ostentation
(though it be to the first degree of vanity) seems to me rather a vice in
Manners, then in Policye; for as it is said, Audacter calumniari, semper
aliquid haeret, So except it be in a ridiculous degree of deformity Audacter te
vendita semper aliquid haeret. For it will stick with the more ignorant and
inferior sort of men, though men of wisdom and rank do smile at it and
despife it, and yet the authority won with many, does counteruaile the
difdaine of a few. But if it be carried with decency and government, as with a
natural pleasant and ingenious fashion, or at times when it is mixte with
some peril and vnsafety, (as in Military persons) or at times when others are
most envied; or with easy and careless passage to it and from it, without
dwelling too long, or being too serious: or with an equal freedom of taxing a
man's self, as well as gracing himself, or by occasion of repelling or putting
down others iniurye or insolency: It does greatly add to reputation; and
surely not a few solid natures, that want this ventositye, and cannot sail
in the height of the winds, are not without some prejudice and disadvantage
by their moderacion.

But for these flourishes and inhansements of virtue, as they are not
perchance unnecessary: So it is at least, necessary that virtue be not
disualewed and imbafed under the just price: which is done in three manners; By
offering and obtruding a man's self; wherein men think he is rewarded when he
is accepted. By doing too much, which will not give that which is well done
leave to settle, and in the end induces saciety: and: By finding to soon the
fruit of a man's virtue, in commendation, applause, honor, favor, wherein if
a man be pleased with a little, let him hear what is truly said, Cave ne
insuetus rebus maioribus videaris, si haec te res parua sicuti magna delectat:

But the covering of defects is of no less importance, then the valewing of
good parts. which may be done likewise in three manners, by Caution, by
Color, and by Confidence, Caution is, when men do ingeniously and discreetely
avoid to be put into those things for which they are not propper: whereas
contrariwise bold and unquiet spirits will thrust themselves into matters
without difference, and so publish and proclaim all their wantes; Color is
when men make a way for themselves, to have a construction made of their
faults or wantes: as proceedinge from a better cause, or intended for some
other purpose: for of the one, it is well said;

Saepe latet vitium proximitateboni:
And therefore whatsoever want a man has, he must see, that he pretend the
virtue that shadoweth it, as if he be Dull, he must affect Gravity, if a
Cowarde, Mildness, and so the rest: for the second, a man must frame some
probable cause why he should not do his best, and why he should dissemble his
abilities: and for that purpose must use to dissemble those abilities, which
are notorious in him to give color that his true wants are but industries and
dissimulations: for Confidence it is the last but the surest remedy: namely to
depresse and seem to despise whatsoever a man cannot attain, observing the
good principle of the Marchantes, who endeavor to raise the price of their own
commodities, and to beat down the price of others. But there is a confidence
that passes this other: which is to face out a man's own defects: in seeming to
conceive that he is best in those things wherein he is failing: and to help
that again, to seem on the other side that he has least opinion of himself,
in those things wherein he is best: like as we shall see it commonly in Poets,
that if they show their verses, and you except to any, they will say, That that
line cost them more labor then any of the rest: and presently will seem to
disable, and suspect rather some other line, which they know well enough to be
the best in the number. But above al in this righting and helping of a man's
self in his own carriage, he must take heed he show not himself dismantelled
and exposed to scorn and injury, by too much dulcenesse, goodness, and
facility of nature, but show some sparkles of liberty, spirit, and edge. Which
kind of fortified carriage with a ready rescussing of a man's self from
scorns, is sometimes of necessity imposed upon men by somewhat in their person
or fortune, but it ever succeeds with good felicity.

Another precept of this knowledge is by all possible endeavor, to frame the
mind to be pliaunt and obedient to occasion; for nothing hinders men's
fortunes so much as this: Idem manebat, nequeidem decebat: Men are where thty
were, when occasions turn, and therefore to Cato, whom Liuie makes such an
Architect of fortune, he adds that he had Versatile Ingenium: And thereof it
comes that these grave solemn wits which must be like themselves, and
cannot make departures have more dignity then foelicity: But in some it is
nature to be somewhat viscouse and inwrapped, and not easy to turn: In some
it is a conceipte, that is almost a nature, which is that men can hardly make
themsel^ns believe that they ought to change their course, when they have
found good by it in former experience. For Macciaue notes wisely how Fabius
Maximus would have been temporizing still, according to his old biasse, when
the nature of the war was altered, and required hot pursuit; In some other
it is want of point and penetration in their judgment, that they do not
discern when things have a periode, but come in, too late after the occasion:
As Demosthenes compares the people of Athens to country fellows, when they
play in a fence-schoole, that if they have a blow then they remove their
weapon to that ward, and not before: In some other it is a loathnesse to leese
labors passed, and a conceit that they can bring about occasions to their
plie, and yet in the end, when they see no other remedy, then they come to it
with disadvantage, as Tarquinius that gave for the third part of Sybillaes
books the treeble price, when he might at first have had all three for the
simple. But from whatsoever root or cause this Restiuenesse of mind
proceeds, it is a thing most prejudicial, and nothing is more politic then
to make the wheels of our mind concentrique and voluble with the wheels of
fortune.

Another precept of this knowledge, which has some affinity with that vvelast
spoke of, but with difference is that which is well expressed, satis accede
Deisque, that men do not only turn with the occasions but also run with the
occasions and not strain their credit or strength to ouer-harde or extreme
points: but choose in their actions that which is most passable: for this will
preserve men from foil, not occupy them too much about one matter, win
opinion of moderation, please the most, and make a show of a perpetual
foelicitye in all they undertake, which cannot but mightily increase reputation.

Another part of this knowledge seems to have some repugnancy with the former
two, but not as I understand it, and it is that which Demosthenes utters in
high terms: Et quemadmodum receptum est, vt exercitum ducat Imperator: sic
and a cordatis viris res ipsae ducendae, vt quae ipsis videntur, ea gerantur,
and non ipsi euentus persequi cogantur. For if we observe, we shall find two
differing kinds of sufficiency, in managing of business: some can make use of
occasions aptly and dexterously, but plotte little: some can urge and pursue
their own plottes well, but cannot accommodate nor take in: either of which
is very imperfect without the other.

Another part of this knowledge is the observing a good mediocrity in the
declaring or not declaring a man's self, for although depth of secrecy, and
making way (qualis est via ^uis in Mari, which the French calls Sourdes
Menees, when men set things in work without opening themselves at all) be
sometimes both prosperous and admirable: yet many times Dissimulatio errores
parit, qni dissimulatorem ipsam illaqueant. And therefore we see the greatest
pollitiques have in a natural and free manner professed their desires, rather
then bin reserved and disguised in them. For so we see that Lucius Sylla made a
kind of profession, That he wished all men happy or unhappy as they stood his
friends or enemies: So Caesar, when he went first into Gaul, made no scruple
to profess, that he had rather be first in a village, then second at Rome.
So again as soon as he had begun the war, we see what Cicero says of
him, Alter (meaning of Coesar) non recusat, sed quodam modo postulat, vt (vt
est) sic appelletur Tyrannus. So we may see in a letter of Cicero to Atticus,
that Augustus Caesar in his very entrance into affairs, when he was a dearling
of the Senate, yet in his harauges to the people, would swear It a parentis
honores consequi liceat, (which was no less then the Tyranny,) save that to
help it, he would stretch forth his hand toward a statua of Caesar's, that
was erected in the place: and men laughed and woondered and said, Is it
possible, or did you ever hear the like, and yet though he meant no hurt,
he did it so handsomlye and ingenuouslye, and all these were prosperous, where
as Pompeye who tended to the same ends, but in a more dark and dissembling
manner, as Tacitus says of him, Occultior non melior, wherein Salust
concurreth ore probo, animo inuerecundo made it his disseigne by infinite
secret Engines, to cast the state into an absolute Anarchy and confusion, that
the state might cast it self into his Arms for necessity and protection, and
so the sovereign power be putt upon him, and he never seen in it: and when
he had brought it (as he thought) to that point when he was chosen Consul
alone; as never any, was; yet he could make noe great matter of it, because
men understood him not: but was feign in the end, to go the beaten tracke of
getting Arms into his hands, by color of (...) the doubt of Caesar's
dessignes: so tedidious, casual, and unfortunate are these deep
dissimulations, whereof it seems Tacitus made this judgment, that they were
a cunning of an inferior form in regard of true policy, attributing the one
to Augustus, the other to Tiberius, where speaking of Liuia, he says: Et cum
ariibus mariti simulatione filij been composita: for surely the continual
habit of dissimulation is but a weak and sluggish cunning, and not greatly
politic.

Another precept of this Architecture of Fortune, is, to accustom our minds
to judge of the proportion or valewe of things, as they conduce, and are
material to our particular ends, and that to do substantially and nor
superficially. For we shall find the Logical part (as I may term it) of
some men's minds good, but the Mathematical part erroneous, that is, they can
well judge of consequences, but not of proportions and comparison, preferring
things of show and sencebefore things of substance and effect. So some fall in
love with access to Princes, others with popular same and applause, supposinge
they are things of great purchase, when in many Cases they are but matters of
Envy, peril, and Impediment:

So some measure things according to the labor and difficulty, or affiduity,
which are spent about them; and think if they be ever moovinge, that they
must needs advance and proceed, as Caesar says in a dispisinge manner of Cato
the second, when he describes how ^orious and indefatigable he was to noe
great purpose: Haec omnia magno fludio agebat. So in most things men are
ready to abuse themselves in thinking the greatest means to be best, when it
should be the Fittest.

As for the true marshalling of men's pursutes toward their fortune as they
are more or less material, I houlde them to stand thus; First the amendment
of their own Minds. For the Remove of the Impediments of the mind will sooner
clear the passages of fortune, then the obteininge fortune will remooe the
Impedimets of the mind; In second place I set down wealth and means, which I
know most men would have placed first: because of the general use which it
bears toward all variety of occasions. But that opinion I may condemn
with like reason as Macchiauell does that other: that moneys weretl^e sinews of
the wars, whereas (says he) the true sinews of the wars are the sinews of
men's Arms, that is a valiant, populous and Military Nation: and he voucheth
aptly the authority of Solon who when Craesus showed him his treasury of goalde
said to him, that if another came that had better Iron, he would be master
o^ his Gould In like manner it may be truly affirmed, that it is not moneys
that are the sinews of fortune, but it is the sinews and steel of men's Mynds,
Wit, Courage, Audacity, Resolution, Temper, Industry, and the like: In third
place I set down Reputation, because of the peremptory Tides and Currants it
has, which if they be not taken in their due time, are sildome recovered, it
being extreme hard to play an after game of reputation. And lastly, I place
honor, which is more easily won by any of the other three, much more by
all, then any of them can be purchased by honor. To conclude this precepte,
as there is order and priority in Matter, so is there in Time, the proposterous
placing whereof is one of the commonest Errors: while men fly to their ends
when they should intend their beginninings: and do not take things in order
of time as they come on, but marshall them according to greatness and not
according to instance, not observing the good precepte Quod nunc instat agamus.

Another precept of this knowledge is, not to embrace any matters, which do
occupy to great a quantity of time, but to have that sounding in a man's ears.

Sed fugit interea, fugit irreparabile tempus, and that is the cause why those
which take their course of rising by professions of Burden, as Lawyers, Orators
painful divines, and the like, are not commonly so politic for their own
fortune, otherwise then in their ordinary way, because they want time to learn
particulars, to wait occasions, and to devise plottes.

Another precept of this knowledge is to imitate nature which does nothing in
vain, which surely a man may do, if he do well interlace his business, and
bend not his mind too much upon that which he prin cipally intends. For a man
ought in every particular action, so to carry the motions of his mind, and so
to have one thing under another, as if he cannot have that he seeks in the
best degree, yet to have it in a second, or so in a third, and if he can have
no part of that which he purposed, yet to turn the use of it to so^what else,
and if he cannot make any thing of it for the present, yet to make it as a seed
of somewhat in time to come, and if he can contriue no effect or substance from
it, yet to win some good opinion by it, or the like so that he should exact an
account of himself of every action, to reap somewhat, and not to stand amazed
and confused if he sail of that he chiefly meant: for nothing is more
impollitique then to mind actions wholly one by one. For he that does so,
leeseth infinite occasions which enterveine, and are many times more proper and
propitious for somewhat, that he shall need afterward: then for that which he
urges for the present; and therefore men must be parfite in that rule: Haec
oportet facere, and illa non omittere.

Another precept of this knowledge is, not to engage a man's self peremptorily
in any thing, though it seem not liable to accident, but ever to have a window
to fly out at, or away to retire; following the wisdom in the ancient fable,
of the two frogs, which consulted when their plash was dry, whether they
should go and the one moved to go down into a pit because it was not likely
the water would dry there, but the other answered, True, but if it do, how
shall we get out again?

Another precept of this knowledge is that ancient precept of Bias, construed
not to any point of perfidiousnesse, but only to caution and moderation Et ama
tanquam inimicus suturus, and odi tanquam amaturus: For it utterly betraieth al
vtility, for me^ to imbarque them selves to far, into unfortunate friendships:
troublesome spleans; and childish and humorous enuies or aemulatio^s.

But I continue this beyond the measure of an example, led, because I would not
have such knowledges which I note as deficient to be thought things
Imaginatiue, or in the air; or an observation or two, much made of but things
of bulk and mass: whereof an end is hardlier made, then a beginning. It must
be likewise conceived that in these points which I mention and set down, they
are far from complete tractates of them: but only as small pieces for
patterns: And lastly, no man I suppose will think, that I mean fortunes are
not obtained without all this ado; For I know they come tumblinge into some
men's lappes, and a number obtain good fortunes by diligence, in a plain way:
Little intermedlinge: and keeping themselves from gross errors.

But as Cicero when he sets down an Idea of a parfit Orator, does not mean
that every pleader should be such; and so likewise, when a Prince or a Courtier
has been described by such as have handled those subjects, the mould has used
to be made according to the perfection of the Art, and not according to co^
mon practice: So I understand it that it ought to be done in the description of
a Pollitique man. I mean pollitique for his own fortune.

But it must be remembered all this while, that the precepts which we have set
down, are of thatkind which may be counted and called Bonae Arts, as for evil
arts, if a man would set down for himself that principle of Machiauel: That a
man seek not to attain virtue it self: But the appearance only thereof,
because the credit of virtue is a help, but the use of it is cumber: or that
other of his principles: That he presuppose, that men are not fitly to be
wrought otherwise but by fear, and therefore that he seek to have every man
obnoxious, low, and in straight which the Italia^s call seminar spine, to sow
thorns: or that other principle contained in the verse which Cice to cyteth
cadant amici, du^modo Inimici intercida^t, as the Trium virs which fould every
one to other the lives of their friends for the deaths of their enemiees: or
that other protestation of L. Catilina to set on fire and trouble states, to
the end to fish in droumy waters, and to vnwrappe their fortunes. Ego si quid
in fortunis meis excitatum sit incendium, id non aqua sed ruina restinguam, or
that other principle of Lysa^der That children are to be deceived with
co^fittes, and men with oaths, and the like evil and corrupt positions, whereof
(as in all things) there are more in number then of the good: Certainly with
these dispensations from the laws of charity and integryty the pressing of a
man's fortune, may be more ha sty and compendious. But it is in life, as it is
in ways The shortest way is commonly the fowlest and surely the fairer way is
not much about.

But men if they be in their own power and do bear and sustain themselves,
and be not carried away with a whirle wind or tempest of ambition: ought in
the pursuit of their own fortune, to set before their eyes, not only that
general Map of the world. That al things are vanity and vexatio^ of spirit, but
many other more par ticular Cards and directio^s, chiefly that, That Being,
without well being: is a curse; and the greater being, the greater curse, And
that all virtue is most rewarded, and al wickedness most punished in it self:
according as the Poet says excellently.

Quae vobis que digna viri, pro laudibus istis
Premia posse rear solui? pulcherrima primum
Dij moresque dabunt vestri:
And so of the contrary. And secondly they ought to look up to the eternal
providence and divine judgment, which often subuerteth the wisdom of evil
plots and imaginations, according to that scripture He has conceived mischief
and shall bring soorth a vainething And although men should refrain themselves
from injury and evil arts, yet this incessant and Sabbathlesse pursuit of a
man's fortune, leaves not tribute which we owe to God of our time who (we see)
demands a tenth of our substance, and a seventh, which is more strict of our
time: and it is (...) to small purpose to have an erected face toward heaven,
and a perpetual groueling spirit upon earth eating dust as does the serpent,
Atque affigit humo Diuinae particulam aurae: And if any man flatter himself
that he will employ his fortune well, though he should obtain it ill, as was said
concerning Aug. Caesar, and after of Septimius Seuerus, That either they should
never have bin born or else they should nener have died, they did so much
mischief in the pursut and asce^tof their greatness, and so much good when they
were established yet these co^pensations and satisfactions, are good to be
used, but never good to be purposed: And lastly it is not amiss for me^ in
their race toward their fortuneto cooll themselves a little with that conceit
which is elega^t ly expressed bythe Emperor, Charles the 5. in his instruc tio^s
to the K. his son, That fortune has sowhat of the nature of a woman, that if
she be too much woed, she is the farther of. But this last is but a remedy for
those whose Tastes are corrupted: let me^ rather build upon that foundation which
is as a cornerstone of divinity and philosophy, wherein they join close,
namely that same Primum quaerite. For divinity says Primum quaerite regnu^ Dei
and ista omnia ad^icie^tur Vobis: and Philosophy says, Primu^ quaerite bona
animi, coetera aut aderunt, aut non oberunt. And although the humane foundation
has somewhat of the same, as we see in M: Brutus when he brake forth into
that speech.

-- Te colui (Virtus) vt rem: ast tu nomen inane es;
Yet the divine foundation is upon the Rock. But this may serve for a Taste of
that knowledge which I noted as deficient.

Concerning government, it is a part of knowledge, secret and retired in both
these respects, in which things are deemed secret: for some things are secret,
because they are hard to know, and some because they are not fit to utter: we
see all governments are obscure and invisible.

-- Totamque infusa per artus,
Men's agitat molem, and magno corpore miscet.
Such is the description of governments; we see the government of God over the
world is hidden; insomuch as it seems to participate of much irregularitie
and confusion; The government of the Soul in moving the Body is inward and
profound, and the passages thereof hardly to be reduced to demonstration.
Again, the wisdom of Antiquity (the shadows whereof are in the Poets) in
the description of torments and pains, next unto the crime of Rebellion, which
was the Giants offense, does detest the offense offacilitie: as in Sysiphus and
Tantalus. But this was meant of particulars; Nevertheless even unto the
general rules and discourses of policy, and government, there is due a
reverent and reserved handling.

But contrariwise in the governors toward the governed, all things ought as
far as the frailty of Man permits, to be manifest, and revealed. For so it
is expressed in the Scriptures touching the government of God, that this Globe
which seems to us a dark and shady body is in the view of God, as Crystal,
Et in conspectu sedis tanqua^ mare vitreu^ simile christallo. So unto Princes
and States, and specially toward wise Senats and Councels, the natures and
dispositions of the people, their conditions, and necessities, their factions
and combinations, their animosities and discontents ought to be in regard of
the variety of their Intelligences, the wisdom of their observations, and
the height of their station, where they keep Centinell, in great part clear
and transparent; wherefore, considering that I write to a king that is a
master of this Science, and is so well assisted, I think it decent to pass
over this part in silence, as willing to obtain the certificate, which one of
the ancient Philosophers aspired unto, who being silent, when others contended
to make demonstration of their abilities by speech, desired it might ^e
certified for his part, that there was one that knew how to hold his peace.

Notwithstanding for the more public part of Government, which is Laws, I
think good to note onley one deficience, which is, that all those which have
written of Laws, have written either as Philosophers, or as lawiers, and none
as Statesmen. As for the Philosophers, they make imaginary Laws for imaginary
co^mon-wealths, and their discourses are as the Stars, which give little light
because they are so high. For the Lawyers, they write according to the States
where they live, what is received Law, and not what ought to be Law; For the
wisdom of a Lawmaker is one, and of a Lawyer is another. For there are in
Nature certain fountains of Justice, whence all Civil Laws are derived, but
as streams; and like as waters do take tinctures and tastes from the soyles
through which they run; So do civil Laws vary according to the Regions and
governments where they are planted, though they proceed from the same
fountains; Again the wisdom of a Lawmaker consists not only in a
platform of Justice; but in the application thereof, taking into
consideration, by what means Laws may be made certain, and what are the
causes and remedies of the doubtfulnesse and incertaintie of Law, by what
means Laws may be made apt and easy to be executed, and what are the
impediments, and remedies in the execution of laws, what influence laws
touching private right of Meum and Tuum, have into the public state, and how
they may be made apt and agreeable, how laws are to be penned and delivered,
whether in Texts or in Acts, brief or large, with preambles, or without how
they are to be pruned and reformed from time to time, and what is the best
means to keep them from being too vast in volumes, or too full of
multiplicitie and crosnesse, how they are to be expounded, When upon causes
emergent, and iudicially discussed, and when upon responses and conferences
touching general points or questions, how they are to be pressed, rigorously,
or tenderly, how they are to be Mitigated by equity and good conscience, and
whether discretion and strict Law are to be mingled in the same Courts, or
kept a part in several Courts; Again, how the practice, profession, and
erudition of Law is to be censured and governed, and many other points
touching the administration, and (as I may term it) animation of Laws. Upon
which I insist the less, because I purpose (if De prude^tia legislatoria,
five, de fontibus Iuris.
God give me leave) having begun a work of this Nature, in Aphorisms, to
propound it hereafter, noting it in the mean time for deficient.

And for your Majesty's Laws of England, I could say much of their dignity,
and somewhat of their defect: But they cannot but excel the civil Laws in
fitness for the government: for the civil Law was, non hos quaesitum munus in
vsus: It was not made for the countries which it governs: hereof I cease to
speak, because I will not intermingle matter of Action, with matter of
general Learning.

THus have I concluded this portion of learning touching Civil knowledge, and
with Civil knowledge have concluded HVMANE PHILOSOPHY and with Humane
Philosophy, PHILOSOPHY in GENERAL; and being now at some pause, looking back
into that I have passed through: This writing seems to me (Si nunquam sailit
imago) as far as a man can judge of his own work, not much better then that
noise or sound which Musitia^s make while they are in tuning their Instruments,
which is nothing pleasant to hear, but yet is a cause why the Music is
sweeter afterward. So have I been content to tune the Instruments of the
Muses, that they may play, that have better hands. And surely when I set before
me the condition of these times, in which learning has made her third
visitation, or circuit in all the qualities thereof: as the excellency and
viuacitie of the wits of this age; The noble helps and lights which we have by
the travails of ancient writers: The Art of Printing, which communicates
Books to men of all fortunes. The ope^nesse of the world by Navigations, which
has disclosed multitudes of experiments, and a Mass of Natural History: The
leisure wherewith these times abound, not employing men so generally in civil
business, as the States of Graecia did, in respect of their popularitie, and
the State of Rome in respect of the greatness of their Monarchy: The present
disposition of these times at this instant to peace: The consumption of all
that ever can be said in controversies of Religion, which have so much diuerted
men from other Sciences: The perfection of your Maj: learning, which as a
Phoenix may call whole volyes of wits to follow you, and the inseparable
propriety of Time, which is ever more and more to disclose truth: I cannot but
be raised to this persuasion, that this third period of time will far
surpass that of the Grecian and Roman Learning: Only if men will know their
own strength, and their own weakness both: and take one from the other,
light of invention, and not fire of contradiction, and esteem of the
Inquisition of truth, as of an enterprise, and not as of a quality or
ornament, and employ wit and magnificence to things of worth and excellency,
and not to things vulgar, and of popular estimation. As for my labors, if any
man shall please himself, or others in the reprehension of them; they shall
make that ancient and patient request, ver bera, sed audi. Let men reprehend
them so they observe and weigh them: For the Appeal is lawful (though it may
be it shall not be needful) from the first cogitations of men to their
second, and from the nearer times, to the times further of. Now let us come to
that learning, which both the former times were not so blessed as to know,
Sacred and inspired Divinity, the Sabbath and port of all men's labors and
peregrinations.

THe prerogative of God extends as well to the reason as to the will of Man;
So that as we are to obey his law though we find a reluctatio^ in our will So
we are to believe his word, though we find a reluctation in our reason: For if
we believe only that which is agreeable to our sense, we give consent to the
matter, and not to the Author, which is no more then we would do toward a
suspected and discredited witness: But that faith which was accounted to
Abraham for righteousness was of such a point, as where at Sarah laughed, who
therein was an Image of Natural Reason.

Howbeit (if we will truly consider of it) more worthy it is to believe, then
to know as we now know; For in knowledge man's mind suffers from sense, but
in belief it suffers from Spirit, such one as it holds for more authorized
then it self, and so suffers from the worthier Agent: otherwise it is of the
state of man glorified, for then faith shall cease, and we shall know as we are
known.

Wherefore we conclude that sacred Theology (which in our Idiome we call
Divinity) is grounded only upon the word and oracle of God, and not upon the
light of nature: for it is written, Caelienarra^t gloriam Dei: But it is not
written Caelienarrant voluntatem Dei: But of that it is said; Ad legem and
testimonium si non fecerint secundu^ verbum istud etc. This holds not only
in those points of faith, which concern the great mysteries of the Deity, of
the Creation, of the Redemption, but likewise those which concern the law
Moral truly interpreted; Love your Enemies, do good to the^ that hate you. Be
like to your heavenly father, that suffers his rain to fall upon the Just and
Unjust. To this it ought to be applauded, Nec vox homine^ sonat, It is a voice
beyond the light of Nature: So we see the heathen Poets when they fall upon a
libertine passion, do still expostulate with laws and Moralities, as if they
were opposite and malignant to Nature: Et quod natura remitti^, invida Iura
negant: So said Dendamis the Indian unto Alexanders Messengers: That he had
heard somewhat of Pythagoras, and some other of the wise men of Graecia, and
that he held them for excellent Men: but that they had a fault, which was that
they had in too great reverence and veneration a thing they called Law and
Manners: So it must be confessed that a great part of the Law Moral is of
that perfection, whereunto the light of Nature cannot aspire: how then is it,
that man is said to have by the light and law of Nature some Notions, and
conceits of virtue and vice, justice and wrong, good and evil? Thus, because
the light of Nature is used in two several senses: The one, ^at which
springs from Reason, Sense, Induction, Argument, according to the laws of
heaven and earth: The other that which is imprinted upon the spirit of Man by
an inward Instinct, according to the law of conscience, which is a sparkle of
the purity of his first Estate: In which later sense only, he is participant
of some light, and discerning: touching the perfection of the Moral law: but
how? sufficient to check the vice, but not to inform the duty. So then the
doctrine of Religion, as well M^all as Mystical, is not to be attained, but by
inspiration and revelation from God.

The use notwithstanding of Reason in spiritual things, and the latitude
thereof is very great and general: for it is not for nothing, that the Apostle
calls Religion our reasonable service of God, insomuch as the very
Ceremonies and Figures of the oulde Law were full of reason and signification,
much more then the ceremonies of Idolatry and Magic, that are full of
Non-significants and Surde Characters; But most specially the Christian faith,
as in all things, so in this deserves to be highly magnified, houlding and
preserving the golden Mediocritie in this point, between the law of the
Heathen, and the law of Mahumet, which have embraced the two extremes. For the
Religion of the Heathen had no constant belief or confession, but left all to
the liberty of argument: and the Religion of Mahumet on the otherside,
interdicteth argument altogether; the one having the very face of Error: and
the other of Imposture; whereas the Faith does both admit and reject
Disputation with difference.

The use of Humane Reason in Religion, is of two sorts: The former in the
conception and apprehension of the Mysteries of GOD to us revealed; The other,
in the inferring and deriuing of doctrine and direction thereupon: The former
extends to the mysteries themselves: but how? by way of Illustration, and not
by way of argument. The later consists indeed of Probation and Argument. In
the former we see God vouch safeth to descend to our capacity, in the
expressing of his mysteries in sort as may be sensible unto us: and does
grifte his Revelations and holy doctrine upon the Notions of our reason, and
applies his Inspiratio^s to open our understanding, as the form of the key to
the ward of the lock; for the later, there is allowed us an use of Reason, and
argument, secondarie and respective; although not original and absolute: For
after the Articles and principles of Religion are placed and exempted from
examination of reason: It is then permitted unto us to make deriuations and
inferences from, and according to the Analogy of them, for our better
direction. In Nature this holds not, for both the principles are examinable
by Induction, though not by a Medium or Sillogisme: and besides those
principles or first positions, have noe discordance with that reason which
draws down and diduceth the inferior positions. But yet it holds not in
Religion alone, but in many knowledges both of greater and smaller Nature,
namely wherein there are not only Posita but Placita, for in such there can be
noe use of absolute reason, we see it familiarly in Games of wit, as Chesse, or
the like; The Draughts and first laws of the Game are positive, but how?
merely ad placitum, and not examinable by reason; But then how to direct our
play thereupon with best advantage to win the game, is artificial and
rational. So in Humane laws, there be many grounds and Maxims, which are
Placita Iuris, Positive upon authority and not upon reason, and therefore not
to be disputed: But what is most just, not absolutely, but relatiuely, and
according to those Maxims, that affords along field of disputation. Such
therefore is that seco^darie reason, which has place in divinity, which is
grounded upon the Placets of God.

Here therefore I note this deficience, that there has not bin to my
understanding sufficiently enquired De vsu legittimo rationis humanae in
diuinis.
and handled, The true limits and use of reason in spiritual things: as a
kind of divine Dialectique, which for that it is not done, it seemethto me a
thing usual, by pretext of true conceiving that, which is revealed, to search
and mine into that which is not revealed, and by pretext of enucleating
inferences and contradictories, to examine that which is positive: The one sort
falling into the Error of Nicodemus, demanding to have things made more
sensible then it pleases God to reveal them; Quomodo possit homo nasci cum
sit senex? The other sort into the Error of the Disciples, which were
scandalized at a show of contradiction: Quid est hoc quod dicit nobis, modicum,
and non videbitis me, and iterum modicum, and videbitis me etc.

Upon this I have insisted the more, in regard of the great and blessed use
thereof, for this point well labored and defined of, would in my judgment be
an Opiate to stay and bridle not only the vanity of curious speculatio^s,
wherewith the schools labor but the fury of controversies, wherewith the
church labors. For it cannot but open men's eyes to see that many
controversies do merely pertain to that which is either not revealed or
positive, and that many others do grow upon weak and obscure Inferences or
deriuations which latter sort of men would reviue the blessed style of that
great Doctor of the Gentiles, would be carried thus: Ego, non Dominus, and
again- Secundum consilium meum, in Opinions and counsels, and not in
positions and oppositions. But Men are now over ready to usurp the style.
Non Ego, sed Dominus, and not so only, but to bind it with the thunder and
denunciation of Curses, and Anathemaes, to the terror of those which have not
sufficiently learned out of Solomon, that The causeless Curse shall not come.

Divinity has two principal parts: The matter informed or revealed: and the
nature of the Information or Revelation: and with the later we will begin:
because it has most coherence with that which we have now last handled. The
nature of the information consists of three branches: The limits of the
information; the sufficiency of the information; and the acquiring or
obtaining the information. Unto the limits of the information belong these
considerations: how far forth particular persons continue to be inspired:
how far forth the Church is inspired: and how far forth reason may be
used; the last point whereof I have noted as deficient. Unto the sufficiency of
the information belong two considerations, what points of Religion are
foundamentall, and what perfectiue, being matter of founder building and
perfection upon one, and the same foundation: and again how the gradations of
light according to the dispensation of times, are material to the sufficiency
of belief.

Here again I may rather give it in advise, then note it as deficient, that
the points foundamentall, Degradibus vnitatis in Ci^itate Dei.
and the points of further perfection only ought to be with piety and
wisdom distinguished: a subject tending to much like end, as that I noted
before: for as that other were likely to abate the number of controversies: So
this is like to abate the heat of many of them. We see Moses when he saw
the Israelite and the Egyptian fight, he did not say, Why strive you? but drew
his sword, and slew the Egyptian: But when he saw the two Israelites fight,
he said, You are brethren, why strive you? If the point of doctrine be an
Egyptian, it must be slain by the sword of the spirit, and not reconciled.
But if it be an Israelite, though in the wrong: then Why strive you. We see of
the foundamentall points, our Savior penneth the league thus, He that is not
with us is against us, but of points not fundamental, thus He that is not
against us, is with us. So we see the Coat of our Savior was entier without
seame, and so is the Doctrine of the Scriptures in it self: But the government
of the Church was of diverse colors, and yet not divided: we see the chafe
may and ought to be severed from the corn in the Ear: But the Tares may not
be pulled up from the corn in the field: So as it is a thing of great use well
to define, what, and of what latitude those points are, which do make men
merely aliens and disincorporate from the Church of God.

For the obtaining of the information, it rests upon the true and sound
Interpretation of the Scriptures which are the fountains of the water of life.
The Interpretations of the Scriptures are of two sorts: Methodical, and Solute,
or at large, for this divine water which excels so much that of Jacobs Well,
is drawn forth much in the same kind, as Natural Water uses to be out of
Wells and Fountains: either it is first forced up into a Cesterne and from
thence fetched and derived for use: or else it is drawn and received in Buckets
and Vessels immediately where it springs. The former sort whereof though it
seem to be the more ready, yet in my judgment is more subject to corrupt.
This is that Method which has exhibited, unto us the scholasticall divinity,
whereby divinity has bin reduced into an Art, as into a Cesterne, and the
streams of doctrine or positions fetched and derived from thence.

In this, Men have sought three things, a summarie brevity, a compacted
strength, and a complete perfection: whereof the two first they fail to
find, and the last they ought not to seek. For as to brevity, we see in all
summarie Methodes, while men purpose to abridge, they give cause to dilate. For
the sum or abridgement by contraction becomes obscure, the obscurity
requires exposition, and the exposition is diduced into large comentaries, or
into common places, and titles, which grow to be more vast then the original
writings, whence the sum was at first extracted. So we see the volumes of the
schoolmen are greater much then the first writings of the fathers, whence the
Master of the sentences made his sum or collection. So in like manner the
volumes of the modern Doctors of the Civil Law exceed those of the ancient
Iurisconsults, of which Tribonian compiled the digest. So as this course of
sums and commentaries is that which does infallibly make the body of Sciences
more immense in quantity, and more base in substance.

And for strength, it is true, that knowledges reduced into exact Methodes have
a show of strength, in that each part seems to support and sustain the
other: But this is more satisfactorie then substantial, like unto buildings,
which stand by Architecture, and compaction, which are more subject to ruin,
then those that are built more strong in their several parts though less
compacted. But it is plain, that the more you recede from your grounds, the
weaker do you conclude, and as in nature, the more you remove your self from
particulars, the greater peril of Error you do incur: So, much more in
Divinity, the more you recede from the Scriptures by inferences and
consequences, the more weak and dilute are your positions.

And as for perfection, or compleatnes in divinity it is not to be sought,
which makes this course of Artificial divinity the more suspecte: For he
that will reduce a knowledge into an Art, will make it round and uniforme: But
in Divinity many things must be left abrupt and concluded with this: O
altitudo Sapientiae and scientiae Dei, quam incomprehensibilia sunt Iudicia
eius, and non inuestigabiles viae eius? So again the Apostle says, Eu part
scimus, and to have the form of a total, where there is but matter for a
part, cannot be without supplies by supposition and presumption. And therefore
I conclude, that the true use of these Sums and Methods has place in
Institutions or Introductions, preparatorie unto knowledge: but in them, or by
diducement from them, to handle the main body and substance of a knoweledge;
is in all Sciences prejudicial, and in Divinity dangerous.

As to the Interpretation of the Scriptures solute and at large, there have
been diverse kinds introduced and devised, some of them rather ruinous and
unsafe, then sober and warranted. Notwithstanding thus much must be confessed,
that the Scriptures being given by inspiration, and not by humane reason, do
differ from all other books in the Author: which by, consequence does draw on
some difference to be used by the Expositor. For the Inditer of them did know
four things which noe man attaines to know, which are the mysteries of the
kingdom of glory; the perfection of the Laws of Nature: the secrets of the
heart of Man: and the future succession of all ages. For as to the first, it is
said. He that presses into the light, shall be oppressed of the Glory. And
again, Noe man shall see my face and live. To the second, When he prepared the
heavens I was present, when by law and compass he enclosed the deep. To the
third, Neither was it needful that any should bear witness to him of Man,
for he knew well what was in Man. And to the last, From the beginning are
known to the Lord all his works.

From the former two of these have been drawn certain senses and expositions
of Scriptures, which had need be contained within the bounds of sobriety; The
one Anagogicall, and the other Philosophical. But as to the former, Man is not
to prevent his time; Videmus nune per speculum in Aenigmate, tunc autem facie
adfaciem, wherein nevertheless there seems to be a liberty granted, as
far forth as the polishing of this glass, or some moderate explication of
this Aenigma. But to press too far into it cannot but cause a dissolution
and overthrow of the spirit of man. For in the body there are three degrees
of that we receive into it: Aliment Medecin and Poison whereof Aliment is that
which the Nature of Man can perfectly alter and ouercom: Medecin is that which
is partly converted by Nature, and partly conuerteth nature: and Poison is that
which works wholly upon Nature without that, that nature can in any part work
upon it. So in the mind whatsoever knowledge reason cannot at all work upon
and convert, is a mere intoxication and indangereth a dissolution of the mind
and understanding.

But for the latter, it has been extremely set on foot of late time by the
School of Paracelsus, and some others, that have pretended to find the truth
of all natural Philosophy in the Scriptures; scandalizing and traducing all
other Philosophy: as Heathenish and Profane: But there is noe such enmity
between Gods word, and his works. Neither do they give honor to the
Scriptures, as they suppose, but much imbase them. For to seek heaven and
earth in the word of God, Whereof it is said, Heaven and Earth shall pass,
but my word shall not pass, is to seek temporary things amongst eternal;
And as to seek Divinity in Philosophy, is to seek the living amongst the
dead; So to seek Philosophy in Divinity is to seek the dead amongst the
living; Neither are ye Pots or Lauers, whose place was in the outward part of
the Temple to be sought in the holiest place of all; where the Arc of the
testimony was seated. And again the scope or purpose of the spirit of God is
not to express matters of Nature in the Scriptures, otherwise then in passage,
and for application to man's capacity and to matters moral or Divine. And it
is a true Rule, Authoris aliud agentis parua authoritas. For it were a strange
conclusion, if a man should use a similitude for ornament or illustration sake,
borrowed from Nature or history, according to vulgar conceit, as of a
Basiliske, an Unicorn, a Centaure, a Briareus, an Hydra or the like, that
therefore he must needs be thought to affirm the matter thereof positiuely
to be true; To conclude therefore these two Interpretations, the one by
reduction or Aenigmaticall, the other Philosophical or Physical, which have
been received and pursued in imitation of the Rabbis and Cabalists, are to be
confined with a Noli altum sapere, sed time.

But the two later points known to God, and unknown to Man; touching the
secrets of the heart, and the successions of time: does make a just and sound
difference between the manner of the exposition of the Scriptures: and all
other books. For it is an excellent observation which has been made upon the
answers of our Savior Christ to many of the questions which were propounded
to him, how that they are impertinent to the state of the question demanded,
the reason whereof is, because not being like man, which knows man's thoughts
by his words, but knowing man's thoughts immediately, he never answered their
words, but their thoughts: much in the like manner it is with the Scriptures,
which being written to the thoughts of men, and to the succession of all ages,
with a foresight of all heresies, coatradictions, differing estates of the
Church, yea, and particularly of the elect, are not to be interpreted only
according to the latitude of the proper sense of the place, and respectively
toward that present occasion, whereupon the words were uttered; or in
precise congruitie or contexture with the words before or after, or in
contemplation of the principal scope of the place, but have in themselves not
only totally, or collectiuely, but distributiuely in clauses and words,
infinite springs and streams of doctrine to water the Church in every part,
and therefore as the literal sense is as it were the maine stream or River:
So the Moral sense chiefly, and sometimes the Allegorical or Typical are
they whereof the Church has most use: not that I wish men to be bold in
Allegories, or Indulgent or light in Allusions: but that I do much condemn
that Interpretation of the Scripture, which is only after the manner as Men
use to interpret a profane book.

In this part touching the exposition of the Scriptures, I can report noe
deficience; but by way of remembrance this I will add, In perusing Books of
Divinity, I find many Books of controversies, and many of common places and
treatises, a mass of positive Divinity, as it is made an Art: a number of
Sermons and Lectures, and many prolixe commentaries upon the Scriptures with
harmonies and concordances: but that form of writing in Divinity, which in my
Judgment is of all others most rich and precious; is positive Divinity
collected upon particular Texts of Scriptures in brief observations, not
dilated into common places: not chaseing after controversies, not reduced into
Method of Art, a thing abounding in Sermons, which will vanish, but defective
in Books which will remain, and a thing wherein this age excels. For I am
persuaded, and I may speak it, with an Absit invidia verbo, and no ways in
derogation of Antiquity but as in a good emulation between the vine and the
olive, That if the choice, and best of those observations upon Texts of
Scriptu^es which have been made dispersedly in Sermons within this your
Emanationes Scripturarum, in doctrinas Positiuas.
Majesty's Islands of Brittanie by the space of these forty years and more
(leaving out the largeness of exhortations and applications thereupon) had
been set down in a continuance, it had been the best work in Divinity,
which had been written since the Apostles times.

The matter informed by Divinity is of two kinds, matter of belief, and truth
of opinion: and matter of service, and adoration; which is also judged and
directed by the former: The one being as the internal soul of Religion, and
the other as the external body thereof: and therefore the heathen Religion was
not only a worship of Idols, but the whole Religion was an Idol in it self,
for it had noe soul that is, no certainty of belief or confession, as a man
may well think, considering the chief Doctors of their Church were the Poets,
and the reason was, because the heathen Gods were noe Jealous Gods, but were
glad to be admitted into part, as they had reason. Neither did they respect the
pureness of heart, so they might have external honor and rites.

But out of these two do result and issue four maine branches of Divinity;
Faith, Manners, Lyturgie, and Government: Faith contains the Doctrine of the
Nature of GOD, of the attributes of GOD, and of the works of GOD; The nature
of GOD consists of three persons in unity of Godhead; The attributes of GOD
are either common to the deity, or respective to the persons; The works of
GOD summarie are two, that of the Creation, and that of the Redemption: And
both these works, as in Total they appertain to the unity of the Godhead:
So in their parts they refer to the three persons: That of the Creation in
the Mass of the Matter to the father, in the disposition of the form to the
Son, and in the continuance and conservation of the being to the Holy spirit:
So that of the Redemption, in the election and counsel to the Father, in the
whole Act and consu^mation, to the Son: and in the application to the Holy
spirit: for by the Holy Ghost was Christ conceived in flesh, and by the Holy
Ghost are the Elect regenerate in spirit. This work likewise we consider
either effectually in the Elect, or privately in the reprobate, or according to
appearance in the visible Church.

For manners, the Doctrine thereof is contained in the law, which discloseth
sin. The law it self is divided according to the edition thereof, into the
law of Nature, the law Moral, and the law Positive; and according to the
style, into Negative and Affirmative, Prohibitions and Commandments. Sin in
the matter and subject thereof is divided according to the Commandments, in
the form thereof it refers to the three persons in deity, Sins of
Infirmity against the father, whose more special attribute is Power: Sins
of Ignorance against the Son, whose attribute is wisdom: and sins of
Malice against the Holy Ghost, whose attribute is Grace or Love. In the motions
of it, it either moves to the right hand or to the left, either to blind
devotion, or to profane and libertine transgressio^, either in imposing
restraint, where GOD grants liberty, or in taking liberty where GOD
imposes restrainte. In the degrees and progress of it, it deuideth it self
into thought, word, or Act. And in this part I commend much the diducing of the
Law of GOD to cases of conscience, for that I take indeed to be a breaking,
and not exhibiting whole of the bread of life. But that which quickneth both
these Doctrines of faith and Manners is the eleuatition and consent of the
heart, whereunto appertain books of exhortation, holy meditation, christian
resolution, and the like.

For the Lyturgie or service, it consists of the reciprocal Acts between
GOD and Man, which on the part of GOD are the Preaching of the word and the
Sacraments, which are seals to the covenant, or as the visible word: and on
the part of Man's Invocation of the name of GOD, and under the law: Sacrifices,
which were as visible prayers or confessions, but now the adoration being in
Spiritu and veritate there remains only vituli labiorum, although the use of
holy vows of thankfulness and retribution, may be accounted also as sealed
petitions.

And for the Government of the Church, it consists of the patrimony of the
church, the franchises of the Church, and the offices, and jurisdictions of the
Church, and the Laws of the Church directing the whole: All which have two
considerations; the one in them selves: the other how they stand compatible and
agreeable to the Civil Estate.

This matter of Divinity is handled either in form of instruction of truth:
or in form of confutation of falsehood. The declinations from Religion besides
the primitive which is Atheism and the Branches thereof, are three, Heresies,
Idolatry, and Witchcraft, Heresies, when we serve the true GOD with a false
worship. Idolatry, when we worship false Gods, supposing them to be true: and
Witchcraft, when we adore false Gods knowing them to be wicked and false. For
so your Majesty does excellently well observe, that Witchcraft is the height
of Idolatry. And yet we see though these be true degrees, Samuel teaches us
that they are all of a nature, when there is once a receding from the word of
GOD, for so he says, Quasi Peccatum ariolandi est repugnare, and quasi scelus
Idololatriae nolle acquiescere.

These things I have passed over so briefly because I can report noe
deficience concerning them: For I can find no space or ground that lies
vacant and unsown in the matter of Divinity, so diligent have men been,
either in sowing of good seed, or in sowing of Tares.

Thus have I made as it were a small Globe of the Intellectual world, as truly
and faithfully as I could discover, with a note and description of those parts
which seem to me, not constantly occupate, or not well converted by the
labor of Man. In which, if I have in any point receded from that which is
commonly received, it has been with a purpose of proceeding in melius, and
not in aliud: a mind of amendment and proficience; and not of change and
difference. For I could not be true and constant to the argument I handle, if
I were not willing to go beyond others, but yet not more willing, then to have
others go beyond me again: which may the better appear by this that I have
propounded my opinions naked and unarmed, not seeking to preoccupate the
liberty of men's judgments by confutations. For in any thing which is well set
down, I am in good hope, that if the first reading move an objection, the
second reading will make an answer. And in those things wherein I have erred,
I am sure I have not prejudiced the right by litigious arguments; which
certainly have this contrary effect and operation, that they add authority
to error, and destroy the authority of that which is well invented. For
question is an honor and preferment to falsehood, as on the other side it is a
repulse to truth. But the errors I claim and challenge to my self as mine
own. The good, if any be, is due Tanquam adeps sacrificij, to be incensed to
the honor first of the divine Majesty, and next of your Majesty, to whom on
earth I am most bounden.
