THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB. OR A Treatise concerning the spiritual espousing
of Christ, to a believing Soul, wherein the subject is fully handled in the
nature of it, in the effects, privileges, symptoms, with the comforts that

TO The Right Worshipful, truly Worthy, and very much honored Knight and
Baronet, St Thomas Barrington, and to his truly virtuous Lady, Grace, Mercy,
and Peace from the Fountain.
Right Worshipful
MAny are those Relations that Christ the Prince of Peace stands in toward
believers, He a Father, they his children, he a Sheapheard, they his sheep, he
an head, they his members, he a King, they his Subjects, he a Lord, they his
Servants, he a general, they his Soldiers, he an husband, they his spouse;
and amongst all these relations, not one enricheth the believing heart with
more heavenly consolation than this, of being a husband to his Church, for by
this the believer becomes assured of all things his heart can desire, of
Communion with Christ, of protection, preservation, maintenance, spiritual and
temporal, yea of heaven it self Christ's spouses jointure: of this most
comfortable subject I have published this small treatise, and the cause
enforcing me to the publication thereof, was the earnest request of some
special and near friends, whose affections were much moved with the Subject
handled in the Pulpit: to satisfy their desire (being no less to me than a
command) and for the comfort and Edification of Gods Church, I have endeavored
to publish the notes somewhat more fully handled than in the Pulpit, hoping
that none will despise Timothy for his Youth, considering that out of the
mouth of Babes the praise of God is perfected. Although I want not some private
respects to enforce me to dedicate this my labor unto your Worships, as that I
may give some open testification of my grateful mind to you both, for those
personal favor received, yet the chiefest reason was because this Treatise
seems to be due to you both, who are joined together not only in the common
bonds of Matrimony, but as Aquila and Priscylla, Zachary and Elizabeth married
together in the Lord and to the Lord Jesus, as to one Husband: this relation to
Jesus Christ appears by that high respect you show to the spokesmen and
faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, by your Piety and Zeal for the honor of
the Lord Jesus. Let Caesar and Pompey contend for superiority in fading and
vanishing greatness. Let your Worships contend with an holy ambition for the
obtaining and retaining of Gods favor, and an humble acquaintance and
communion with his heavenly highness, by keeping Faith and a pure Conscience.

Let the men of this world, whose sole portion is in this life, glory that they
are crowned with a concurrance of present felicities. Let your Worships glory
be, that together with a confluence of worldly contentments, the God of heaven
has crowned you with his Mercy and Grace in Christ, and esteem it your
chiefest Honor that God has made you Honorable with the Bereans for your
love to the truth; with Iabez for your Piety and Devotion, and that he has
made you Noble with Theophilus for your love to God, his People, his Laws, his
Cause, which love of truth, piety, and devotion; love to God and his cause,
shall give a luster to all your other greatness, and shall be able in the day
of trial and account, to make you stand like an unmovable Rock with
triumphing confidence before the terror of the last day, when all other
worldly greatness without the former shall shrink in the wetting, and shall
wish it self so little it could not be seen; in that shall call to the
Mountains to fall upon it and to cover it. The great God of heaven and earth,
replenish your Noble hearts with a daily increase of heavenly hords of Grace,
and treasures of Comforts in the practice of Holiness, and perseverance in
well doing, which may give you an earnest of those inexhaustable treasures of
joy and happiness, reserved in the highest heavens for all that love the Lord
Jesus in sincerity, this shall be the daily prayer of him who humbly desires to
be accounted

Your Worships truest friend and servant for the good of your Souls: BENJAMIN
KING.

THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB.
Hosea 2.20. I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness.
THe sweetest music consists of discords. It is so with the Harmony of Gods
Word in general, and with this Chapter in particular. In the former part to
the 12. verse, God stands as it were upon Mount Eball pronouncing his curses;
from the 12. verse to the end, he stands as it were upon Mount Gerizim
proclaiming his mercies; in the former as upon Mount Sinai, thundering in his
Judgment; in the latter part as upon Mount Sion, alluring in many sweet and
Evangelicall promises, of which his text is the summary and Epitome of the
rest. I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness. The matter included in this
text is this.

That there is a spiritual betrothing of Christ unto every truly believing
soul, which will more fully appear, if we consider these three particulars.

First the precedent of this

Secondly, the nature and

3. The Consequents of

The precedent of this spiritual Christian before the act of this spiritual
betrothing is wedded to one sin or another, which walks with him in the day,
sleeps with him in the night, that lies in his bosom, and is as dear to him
as his wife, but before Christ espouseth himself unto that soul, there must
be a bill of divorcement drawn betwixt it, and all other darling sins, and
endeared corruptions to give entertainment to Christ alone. The Harlot could
be content the living child should be divided. 1 King. 3.26. whereas the true
mother of the child had rather part with all the child, than to have the
child divided. The Devil like the Harlot can be content to have half the
heart, because he knows, if he has half the heart, by this means he
shall enjoy the whole; but Christ like the true mother of the Child, will have
all or none, though a broken heart be his delight, yet a divided heart is
odious unto him, hence is it that Christ before he vouchsafes this favor of
espousing himself to any soul, requires there should be a divorcement of all
sin to give entertainment to himself alone, this is expressed by the
Psalmist, Psalm. 45.11.12. Hearken O daughter and consider, incline thine ear:
forget also thine own people, and thy Fathers house. So shall the King have
pleasure in thy beauty, for he is thy Lord God, and worship thou him: Our
Prophet, v. 16. of this chapter, shows the truth of this, that Christ in his
love will permit no corrivall: Thou shall call me Ishi and call me no more
Bauli; Cornel. de Lap. in Hos. 2.16 Par. in eundem locum.
why not Bauli as well as Ishi? they signifying both the same thing, sounding
as much as my Lord, my husband: the reason was because Baal was the name of an
Idol, now God does so abhor that an Idol should have the least
communication and corrivality with him, that he would not be called by the
name of an Idol, so offensive is the very name of another lover unto him. So
Hosea 14.8. Ephraim being once espoused to God, cries out, what have I to do
any more with Idols: so the Apostle persuading the Romans to put on the Lord
Jesus Christ, he bids them first to abjure surfeiting and drunkenness,
chanbering and wantonness, and so to put on the Lord Jesus Christ.

Consider the nature and Ephesians. 5.32. they two shall be one flesh, this is a
great mystery, but I speak of Christ and his Church, says the Apostle. Now
this union is not a mere notionall and intellectual union, that consists only
in the understanding, and without the understanding is nothing, nor yet a
conjunction of affection only, as Jonathan and David are said to have one
soul and heart, but it is a true and real union; nor yet such a real union
as if there was an union of substance and person, for so many believers there
are, so many distinct persons there are, and all distinct from the person of
Christ and his Godhead, which is inco^municable; but this union is a real,
mystical, and spiritual union, caused two ways.



faith.

First on Christ's part, by his ab una eademque forma informante, from one and
the same soul informing the head and all the members, all they are made one
compositum. So it is with Christ and believers: believers are distinct persons
and distinct from the person of Christ, yet by one and the same Spirit, abiding
in Christ and believers they become one, this the Apostle intimates, 1 Cor.
6.17. He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit, so Saint John that Disciple
that leaned on Christ's breasts, and thence sucked many a spiritual truth, makes
the participation of the Spirit an evidence of Christ's abiding in believers,
and of their abiding in Christ, 1 John 3.24.

I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, some would have this word
faithfulness referred to God, and so to note the truth of Gods promise of
espousing himself unto his Church, but others better take this word
faithfulness, to note the grace of justifying faith; for I find the word here
used in the original (...) to be referred to the saving faith of the just,
Hab. 2.4. The just shall live by his own faith, so that the meaning of the
Prophet in this place is this: whereas verse 19. he says in regard of God,
this espousing is in justice and mercy, so on believers part, it must be in
faith and obedience, so that it is faith which is the applicatory instrument of
this great benefit of this spiritual Marriage; for God will so espouse
himself in justice and mercy, as that the believer must receive this grace by
faith.

This spiritual betrothing Ezekiel. 16.8. I entered into covenant with thee, says
the Lord, and thou becamest mine, which covenant is that Christ will be to the
soul a loving and careful husband, and the soul must be to Christ a
morigerous and an obedient spouse, this mutual covenant the Apostle expresses
fully, Ephesians. 5.24.25, Husbands love your wives, as Christ loved his Church,
there is the covenant on Christ's part: Wives be subject to your husbands as the
Church is subject unto Christ; there is the covenant on the believers part:
this covenant is expressed by this Prophet, verse last: I will be your God and
ye my people.

Cant. 2.16. My beloved is mine, and I am his: my beloved is mine, there is the
believers interest in Christ, and I am his, there is Christ's interest in a
believer. A believer does not by faith so lay hold on Christ as a man with his
hand lays hold on a Pillar or tree, for a man may lay hold on a tree, and the
tree never lay hold on him again; but he lays hold on Christ so by faith,
that by the same act of faith he is apprehended by Christ again: this the
Apostle intimates, Phil^p. 3.13. I follow after, if that I may apprehend that
for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus: here is (...) and (...) an
apprehending and a being apprehended of Christ, and therefore this mutual
apprehending of a believer by Christ, and of Christ by a believer, is lively
expressed by the metaphor of kissing and saluting, Cant. 1.2. Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his lips; here the Church would have Christ to kiss her.
Psalm. 2. ult. Kiss the Son: here Christ desires a kiss of his Church; in
this saluting and kissing, there is a mutual embracing and touching of one
another, this expresses the manner of the work of faith in apprehending
Christ, for by faith the soul so embraces Christ that by the same Act of
faith it is embraced by Christ again, this is that mutual interest as the
believing soul challenges Christ to be its Bridsgroome, so it gives Christ an
interest in it self to be his faithful and obedient spouse, and this
distinguishes the false spouse of Christ from the true spouse: there is never
an hypocrite and nominall Christian, that has no more of Christianity than the
outside and title, but he will be ready to claim interest in Christ; crying I
hope in my God, my Christ, my Jesus; but the question is, whether Christ has
interest in him, if not, his claiming of interest in Christ will avail him
nothing. Mat. 7.22.23. Many will say to Christ at the last day; Lord, Lord, we
have Prophesied in thy Name, we have in thy Name cast out Devils, and done many
wonderful works: here is a fair interest in Christ pretended, but Christ
disclaimes them as having no interest in them: I never knew you, depart from me
ye workers of iniquity. But it is otherwise with the true Christian and sincere
believer: as he is able to say that Christ is his Savior, Lord, and
Bridesgroome, so is he able to affirm by the Testimony of his Conscience, that
Christ has interest in him as his obedient servant and faithful spouse, thus
we see the particulars, wherein this spiritual Marriage does consist.

Secondly, some are proper Isaiah expresses on Gods part that his people
should be called Hephzibah, that is, my delight is in her: and thy land Beulah,
that is, married, and affirms that as the Bridsgroome rejoices over his
Bride; so the Lord would rejoice over his people: this delight is so great that
Christ takes in his Spouse, that Christ affirms he was ravished in his heart
by his Spouse, Cant. 4.9. and acknowledges himself to be bound in her
galleries. Cant. 7.5. That is tied in bonds of love toward his Spouse: and as
Christ delights thus in his Spouse, so the satisfied soul delights in Christ,
and that many ways. First in the contemplation of his person, his beauty and
comeliness, Cant. 5.10. My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest of ten
thousand. Cant. 2.3. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his
fruit was sweet to my taste. So David makes this his chief desire, and his
only desire to dwell in the house of God. Psalm. 27.4. and this he desires that
he may behold the beauty of the Lord. Thirdly, Cant. 2.8. It is the voice of my
beloved. This is the Churches acclamation for joy at the hearing of Christ's
voice, the word of Grace and the Gospel. Christ gives this as an eare-marke to
his sheep; My sheep hear my voice, and follow me, John 10.3.4. and the
Baptist makes this a sign of a friend to the Bridsgroome that he stands by
and rejoices greatly because of the Bridesgroomes voice. John 3.29. Fourthly,
Christ's Spouse delights His delight (says David) is in the Law of God,
speaking of the blessed man. Psalm. 1.2. Thy Laws are my delight, my
Counselors, sweeter than the Honey and the Honey comb, dearer than thousands
of gold and silver. 119. Lastly a believer delights in communing with Christ
and speaking unto him in prayer: hear what sweet expressions have proceeded
from a sanctified soul. Lord I have loved the habitation of thine house: I was
glad when they said, let us go to the house of the Lord, which is the house of
prayer.

(...). Arist. Eth^c. l. 8. c. 5.
a cohabitation is necessary to the making and conserving of true friendship,
much more to the preservation of conjugall affection, therefore (...). Arist.
lib. 2. Oeconomic. c. 2.
Aristotle thinks nothing to be more due to be performed of an husband to
his wise, than an holy society: this blessed society is maintained betwixt
Christ and his spouse, expressed by Christ. John 15.4. Abide in me, and I in
you, and by his Disciple whom he loved. 1 John 3. ult. He that keeps his
Commandments dwells in him, and he in him. This society is performed on
Christ's part when he is present by his spirit in the Temple of the believers
heart, confirming, comforting, and refreshing of him by his spirit, in the
assurance of his love, so Christ told his Disciples he would not leave them
Orphans, but he would come unto them and be with them to the end of the world,
though not in his personal presence, yet by the Comforter his holy spirit;
again this mutual society is performed on the souls part with Christ, whilst
the soul with Henoch and Noah walks with God, having God always before its
eyes, always awed with an apprehension of his glorious presence, conforming it
self to his will in all things, often hearing him speak in his house, often
speaking unto him by prayer, often frequenting his Sacraments, often communing
with holy meditations, heavenly soliloquies and ejaculations, this is the
second consequent.

A third consequent mutual betwixt Christ and a believer, is a mutual bearing
of one another burden, (...), etc. Arist. l. 2. Oeconomicae. ^^n principio.
A good husband says the Philosopher, undertakes the care of things abroad, a
good wife undergoes the burden of domesticke affairs and businesses to be
done within doors, and thus has the wise disposer of all things appointed man
and wife their several employments agreeable to their several sexes and
distinct conditions. Solomon speaking of the wife, says that she should be as
the pleasant Hind and young Roe, now, as Cervi and Cervae cum fretum ad insulam
transeunt pascuorum gratia, sic se ordinant, ut onera capitum suorum quae
gestant in cornibus super invicem portent, ita ut posterior super anteriorum
cervice projecta, caput collocet, and vicibus id agere dicuntur, ita invicem
onera sua portantes fretum transeunt ad terrae stabilitate^. Aug. q. ^1.
Augustine notes, the Heart and Hind are serviceable, one to another in bearing
one another burden. It is so with Christ and his Church, he takes the burden
off his Spouse, and lays it upon himself, and gives his Spouse a command to
take upon her his yoke. Math. 11.28. Come unto me all ye that are weary and
heavy laden, and I will ease you, here Christ beats the yoke of his spouse,
v. 29. Take my yoke upon you, here Christ enjoyneth his spouse to take up his
yoke as he has borne here; the yoke that Christ bears for his spouse, is the
yoke of sin, and the burden of Gods wrath under which all the creatures in
heaven, and upon earth, would have sunk down to have undergone, therefore
Christ both God and man undertakes to bear it for his spouse, and the burden
and yoke that Christ imposes on his spouse to bear is the yoke of obedience,
called Christ's yoke, because he himself has borne it, he himself enjoynes
it, Is dat quimandat, qui jubet, illo juvat.
and he himself supports his spouse in bearing of it, this yoke of Christ
does his spouse willingly bear in performing universal, cheerful, sincere
and constant obedience to all Christ's commands in full purpose and desire of
the heart, in the earnest endeavor of the whole man, which Evangelicall
obedience Christ accepts and accounts as perfect obedience for his own sake.

Quam quaeris aliam inter sponsos necessitudinem, vel connexionem praeten amari
and amare. Bern. Ser. 31. in Cant.
affection and dearest love. First, for the love of Christ to a believer it is
transcendent, and differing from a Christians love to Christ. First in time:
secondly in degree: thirdly as a cause differs from an effect. First in time,
Christ's love is the preventing love, and this magnifies the love of Christ; it
is a chief porperty of great love when it is (...). Arist. l. 2. Rhet. c. 9.
preventing and therefore the Apostle John calls it love indeed that Christ
loved us first.

Secondly, Christ's love differs and exceedes the love of his Spouse in degree,
he being the fountain of love, and the love of a Christian but a stream
flowing from that fountain, he the Son of Righteousness. Mal. 4.2. From
whom the beams of mercies flow daily upon the hearts of his beloved ones;
their love being but a beam coming from that Son, therefore God is said to
be love it self in the abstract, in regard of the transcendencie of his love
surpassing the love of all. Thirdly, Christ's Spirit and the fervencie of his
affection to a Christian: the heat that is in the inferior region of the
air, is nothing but an effect of the reverberation of the beams of the Sun
upon the earth, the heat of a Christians heart that burns within him, with a
love and zeal to the Lord Jesus, is nothing else but a reflection of those hot
sun beams of Christ's mercies shed abroad in the heart of a believer. Our
clothes in the morning receive heat first from our bodies, but being heated
by our bodies, they keep our bodies warm all the day following: A Christians
heart must first be clothed with the sun of righteousness, and so warmed
with his beams, being but once thoroughly warmed, it ever after glowes within
toward Christ in love again: now as Christ bears a love to a Christian far
exceeding the love of the fondest Bridsgrome to his endeared Spouse, so there
is a retaliating affection in every believing soul toward Christ. We may as
well imagine fire without a power to give heat, as to imagine Christ's love
bestowed upon a soul without this affection in the heart, to whom Christ has
made his love known by betrothing himself. (...) Arist. Rhet. lib. 2. c. 4.
Aristotle speaking of a friend describes him to be such an one that loves and
is loved again: And again in another place affirms that to be true
friendship where love is (...). Arist. l. 2. magni. moral. c. 11.
reciprocal, if then love amongst friends be mutual much more betwixt (...).
Arist. l. 2. Oeconomie. c. 2.
man and wife, betwixt Christ and his Spouse, the very name of Bridsgroome
calls for love. Ludolphus de vita Christi ex Gregorio.
It is the observation of a Father, sometimes God calls himself by the name of
a Father, sometimes by the name of a Master, sometimes by the name of a
Bridsgrome, when he would produce a filial fear in the hearts of his
children, he calls himself by the name of a Father. If I be a Father where is
my fear? when he would produce homage and service in his servants he calls
himself by the name of a Lord. If I be your Master and Lord, where is me
honor and service? When he would beget love and affection in them he styles
himself a Bridsgroome. If I be a Bridsgroome where is my love? Now this love
that a Christian owes and gives to Christ as the Spouse of Christ, has
several distinct properties, whereby it is discerned from the love that
worldlings may pretend to Christ.

First, it is such a love Conticles cap. 1. verse. 5. I am sick of love, says
the Church concerning Christ her Bridsgrome: this sickness of the soul for
love is nothing but a fainting and languishing for desire of Christ, whom the
soul loves, this the wise man expresses, Pro. 13.12. Hope deferred, makes
the heart sick, now the soul hoping for those soule-transporting pleasures to
be found in the apprehension of Christ's favor and sense of his presence, and
yet obtaines not the inward apprehension of his gracious residence in the
soul, upon this the heart begins to faint and languish, and to be sick of
love: the desire of a Christian toward Christ is not any faint and remiss
desire, but a longing desire, such a desire that stretches the affection to
the highest strain, and therefore expressed in Scripture by the metaphors of
thirsting, gasping, panting, now as experience teaches in some cases, longing
brings danger when the thing longed for is not obtained; whereas an ordinary
desire will not hurt in the denial of the thing desired: as the effects of
longing are dangerous when the thing longed for is delayed, as fainting,
sownding, languishing, it is so in spiritual longing for Christ, the soul
thirsting for Christ, and finding him not, falls a sownding, fainting and grows
to a kind of Sprituall sickness for love and desire of Christ.

This love is a kind of doting love that carries the soul to a spiritual
distraction, this we may see in Peter, who in the transfigration was so
transported with affection, so ravished with the love of Christ, that like a
man spiritually distracted he knew not what he said, says the text, Mark
9.6. So Saint Paul in his rapture into the third heaven, he speaks like a man
besides himself for the present. 2 Corinthians. 12.2.3. and 5. I knew a man in
Christ above fourteen years ago, whether in the body I cannot tell, or
whether out of the body I cannot tell; God knows: such an one caught up to
the third heaven: and I knew such a man, whether in the body, or out of the
body I cannot tell, God knows. verse 5. Of such an one will I glory, of my
self I will not glory: here we see the Apostle for the present in a blessed
kind of spiritual distraction in love to Christ, and heaven, whereunto he
was caught.

This love in the third place is a Amat profecto cast quae ipsum, quem amat,
quaerit, non aliud quid praeter ipsum. Bern. Sermon. 7. in Canti^.

Sponsa non petit libertatem, non mercedem, non haereditatem, sed osculum more
plane castissimae sponsae, ac sacrum spirantis amorem, nec ^omnino valen it is
flammam dissimulare, quam patitur, osculetur, inquit, me osculo oris sui, quasi
dicat, quid mihi est in coelo, and a te quid volui super terram. Bern. ibid.


free love whereby the believing soul cleaves unto Christ for himself and
those glorious excellencies it sees in our Savior Christ, this property
distinguishes it from that Cave anima, ne, quod absit, meretrix dicaris, si
munera dantis plus quam amantis affectum diligis. Aug. medit. l. 2. c. 4.
meretritious and mercenary love in worldlings, that follow Christ as Christ
upbraided some of the same stamp for the fishes and bread wherewith he fed
them. John 6.26. This hired love the Cum magno calumniatore habemus negotium,
si quaerit singere quod non est, ut in Job. quanto magis objicere quod est?
Aug. de temp. Sermon. 234.
Devils objected against Jobs sincerity; Does Job fear God for naught? but Job
cleaving to God upon the dunghill, and in the lowest condition, proved the
Devil in that particular as he was from the beginning, to be a liar.

The fourth property of a Christians love to Christ the Bridsgroome of his
soul is, that it is a strong and peremptory love; it will carry a Christian
through all Amemus nos Christum ejusque semper quaeramus amplexus, and facile
videbitur omne difficile, brevia putabimus universa quae longa sunt. and jaculo
illius vulnerati perhorarum momenta dicemus: Heus, me quia pereginatio mea
prolongata est. Hier. scribeus ad Eustochium.
difficulties and straights to Christ. The love of Rachel carried Jacob through
14. years of hard service, the love of Christ will carry a Christian through
more difficulties than Labans service had in it. Cant. 8.6.7. It is said to be
as strong as death, that conquers the greatest giant and the mightiest Monarch:
zeal, that is, love inflamed is as inexorable as hell it self, it is said to
have fiery coals that pierce the heart, which fiery coals of love all the
waters, be it a deluge and inundation of miseries and calamities, persecutions,
and temptations, are not able to quench. Love is of that strength that it
facilitates the greatest difficulties. This we see in the ordinary bodily
recreations, many men take a pleasure in a toil as in hunting, running,
leaping, ringing, wrestling, and the like, and all out of love to these
recreations, much more is the love of Christ able to sweeten the hardest duty
that Christ imposes upon his Spouse. What was it that made the fiery faggots
to those blessed witnesses of the truth to seem as beds of Roses? but love.
What made the Disciples to forsake all? but Christ, and that love they bear to
him. What made Paul and Silas sing in Prison, and the Apostles to return from
the Council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer for Christ? but
love to Christ. What made the renowned Champion Stephen valiant in the midst of
death? but the sight of the Son of God, standing at the right hand of his
father, and I am persuaded that if it had been offered to Stephen that he
should have been delivered from his present pain, upon condition he should
have been deprived of his present vision of Christ, by the opening of the
heavens, the love of Christ, would not have suffered Stephen to have accepted
of deliverance upon such condition, so we read of those strong ones in faith
though weak in sex, they would not accept of deliverance in the midst of
their torturings that they might obtain a better resurrection. Heb. 11.35. To
conclude this, Paul being armed with this love challenges all the powers and
peers of hell it self. Romans 8.35. Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ, shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
nakedness, or peril, or sword? as if he had said, shall this or that, if
there be any more put them all into the scale, and weigh but the love of Christ
against them all, and they shall be found too light to sway my heart from the
love of the Lord Jesus.

Cor. 13.4. makes a property of true Charity, that it is bountiful: (...).
Arist. Ethic. l. 8. c. 13.
bounty is the fruit of love, and it is exercised toward any thing according
to love: if a man love his body, nothing is thought too dainty to feed it, too
gorgeous to cloth it; if a man love his pleasure, nothing is counted too dear
to maintain it: so where there is any true conjugal affection in a Christian
heart, that heart will relish any thing that tends to the honor of Christ, it
will down with frequent prayer, humble and daily confession of sin, zealous
and Godly walking with God, sincere universal, and constant obedience to
Christ, though it be with the parting of the most dearly beloved sins, that
soul will think no tears of repentance, no hearing, reading, singing, no
duties public or private too much, whereby the honor of Christ may be
advanced, and its love to Christ better expressed. Luke 7.47. Mary Magdalen is
said to love much, and this her great love was expressed to Christ, by her
bounty in washing his feet, in anointing his head, in wiping his feet with
the hairs of her head, and Christ himself accepts of her washing, anointing,
kissing and all other of her acts of bounty, as Characters of her great inward
affection.

Moses his serpent devoured all other serpents, because his serpent was from
God, so the love of God being from God eats and consumes the love of all
things besides, as it is said of Joseph that there was none greater in Pharaohs
Court, and in the land of Egypt than himself, the like may be said of Christ
in a believing heart, there is none greater than Christ, he is the Pilot that
governes the ship, the King that governes the whole man, the Master and Lord
that keeps the house of a sanctified heart, to whom, as King and Lord, all the
powers of the whole man submit, all do homage, all perform respect, fear,
and love, and if there be love bestowed upon any other thing besides Christ, as
upon our selves and our neighbors, yet it is for Christ's sake and in
subordination to him, whom to love in due measure, is to love without measure.

all that he had, he went away sorrowful. The Rulers many of them professed
fair love to Christ, but yet when it came to this pass, that they which
confessed Christ must be cast out of the Synagogue, John 12.42.
they would not confess him any longer, so that it is constancy in our love
to Christ that proves our love to be a true conjugall affection. Thus much of
the consequents of this spiritual marriage, which are mutual betwixt Christ
and his spouse, the consequents that are proper and peculiar follow, and these
are either

Such as are exparte sponsi,

Such as ere ex part sponsae, on a believers part.

The 1. consequent on Christ's part.
Christ will communicate those secrets to a believing soul espoused unto him,
that he will not communicate to a stranger: a man will communicate much to his
friend according to the Proverb, (...): All things amongst friends are common,
but much more will a man communicate to the wife of his bosom: Dalilah,
Sampsons wife could get the meaning of the riddle out of Sampson, that all the
Philistines could not find out: so is the Spouse of Christ privy to those
secrets that all the wise and learned, being not espoused to Christ, are
ignorant of. The secrets of the Lord are to them that fear him. Psalm. 25.13.
He reveals his secrets to his Servants the Prophets, Amos, 3.7. My beloved
had me into his Chambers, says the Spouse of Christ, Cant. 1.4. Cant. 1.4.
opened.
Now as Chambers are places of safety, as the Prophet shows, Isay 26.20. Come
my people, enter into my chamber: so chambers are places of greatest secrecy,
hence in Scripture they are called privy chambers, and secret places opposed
to the house top. 2 King. 6.12. Luke 12.3. Mat. 6.6. for Christ then to have
his Spouse into his Chambers is nothing else but to make her privy to his
secrets, for this privilege our blessed Savior broke forth into a Doxologie
unto his father. Mat. 11.25. I thank thee O Father that thou have hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them unto babes.

Solution.


Dic nobis tu qui preparas quid preparas: replebiniur bonis domus tuae, sed
quib^s bonis? vine, olco, f^umento? sed haec novimus videmus and fastidimus, id
quaerimus quod oculus non vidit Bern. Sermon. 11. in Caniic.
Such secrets as Eye has not seen, neither ear heard, neither can it enter
into the heart of man to conceive. 1 Cor. 2.9.10. to instance in some
particulars. The first secret is the pardon of sin, the most blessed news
and most joyful tidings that can come to the soul of a reasonable creature,
when the soul with Heman, Psalm. 88.7. lies crying day and night under the
indignation of the Lord, with David roaring for very disquietnesse of Spirit,
with Job the arrows of the Lord drinking us its spirit, then for Christ to
whisper unto the soul in secret by his Spirit, and to say unto it, Spouse be
of good comfort, Thy sins are forgiven thee, this is a secret Christ will
communicate to none, but unto his spouse.

But some may say, how may a poor soul know whether this voice of Christ by
his spirit be not a delusion of Satan?

Answ. It is true that the devil can suggest falsely into his own children,
what Christ in truth suggests into the hearts of his own people, and that
often he can counterferfeite this testimony of the Spirit concerning the pardon
of sin, putting in thoughts of comfort, mercy and remission of sin, and of
peace to the soul, when God makes himself ready for War. But by this may
Christ's voice comforting the soul be known from Satan's flatteries and false
persuasions, How Christ's voice is known from Satan's illusion, concerning the
pardon of sin.
from the time and condition the soul is in, when these thoughts of Mercy and
tidings of pardon of sin come unto the soul, if the soul (as before) be in
a disconsolate condition by reason of the sense of the burden of sin, and
deep apprehension of Gods wrath, then for the soul to receive comfort, and to
entertain thoughts of mercy, lifting up the soul as it were from the gates of
hell, to the suburbs of heaven; this is a good sign it is the work of Christ
and his voice by his Spirit communicating this secret of mercy and pardon of
sin, because this is against the policy of Satan to comfort the soul, and
to lift it up when it is in sinking through the sense of Gods wrath, but on the
contrary, his ordinary course is when the soul is in heaviness, dejection and
anguish, and inclining to desperation, to follow the soul close, to drive it
into the further degree of despair, till it be swallowed up of it. But if the
soul shall have thoughts of mercy, and assurance of salvation suggested into
it, when it has never felt the burden of sin, the spirit of bondage, never
been truly humbled for sin, this is a sign of an illusion of Satan to
drive the soul to perish by presumption, which is a more frequent Rock,
against which the soul splits it self, than desperation.

Nicodemus though a teacher in Israel, yet ignorant in this point till Christ
instructed him in it, and at Christ's first relating of it unto him it seemed a
What a parable is regeneration to many even old men, Masters, and teachers, and
rulers in Israel, who knew no other nativity but one of Adam and Eve, no
progeny of God and his Church, no other parents but such as beger earthly
children to a natural life, etc. D. Tailor on Tit. p. 65.
riddle unto him, till Christ showed him how, and in what manner it was
wrought, John 3.4.5. Many can talk of the dangers of War, of the wonders of
the Sea, of the Indies and remote places, who yet never were in war, upon the
sea, or in any forementioned Countries, but they that have been in hot
skirmishes of war, that have gone down into the deep, and occupied ships in
the great waters, they that have seen the Indies and remote places; have
bought their knowledge at a dear rate of hard labor, great danger and long
travail, the difference of these is this, the one know by hearsay, by
reading, and the like, the other by experience: it is so in present case, we
may hear one speaking of regeneration, another disputing of it, and both
ignorant of it in regard of any experimental knowledge, but the true
Christians knowledge of the work of grace is experimental, he can tell the
method that God used in the new framing and that God broke his heart in pieces
by the hammer of his Word, and threatening of the Law, that then he thawed and
dissolved his frozen heart, by the sweet Evangelicall promises, and those
comfortable Revelations of the Lord Jesus, the Lord of life, unto his soul,
that he then formed Christ day by day, mortifying his sin by degrees, and
every day giving the soul a greater measure of inward quickening and
vivification to the life of holiness and righteousness; this secret work of
regeneration, Christ communicates only to his Spouse.

But how shall I know may some say,

Michal laid in the bed for David was like unto David, whereby she would have
deluded the messengers of Saul, as morality, cessation from grosser sins,
partial obedience and the like; all which and many are but fair colors to
paint over an unregenerate branches, regeneration is a metamorphosing of the
heart, these but changes of the outward conversation in some measure, again
these differ from regeneration in the cause. Civil honesty, Luthers time,
became Lutherans: so many being stems growing of a religious stock, brought up
under careful and religious Masters, tutors, and guardians, are many times
civilized, and yet made not at all acquainted with the secret work of man's
regeneration, than that which goes any further than the outward carriage and
conversation. 1 Cor. 5.1.
so Paul speaks of such a fornication as was not named amongst the Heathens,
that is, the Heathens made conscience of such a kind of fornication. Abimelech
an Heathen abstained from Sarah, Abraham's wife, and God ascribes it to the
integrity of his heart. Genesis 20.6. Number. 22.18.
Balaam that wicked sorcerer would not at the first go against the
Commandment of the Lord for an house full of gold and silver; so Hazael 2
King. 8.13. Is thy servant a dog that I should do this thing; he abhorres it
at the first hearing as an horrid wickedness, becoming a dog better than a
man: by all which instances it appears that a man may abstain from many
gross sins, out of a natural and carnal conscience, whereas regeneration
brings reformation from a conscience purified and sprinkled with the blood of
Christ. These things to wit morality, etc. may proceed from ingenuity of
nature, and from a restraining grace that God puts into the hearts of many
unregenerate men, which grace if God should not give it to some men, man by
nature would be more (...). Arist. l. 1. Pol. c. 2.
savage than the Bear, more truculent than the Tiger, more cruel than the
Wolf of the morning, more brutish than the beasts of the Forest. These may
proceed in the fourth place from fear of the loss of reputation, men are
loath to be counted the scumme of the world, the raffle of the people, the
basest of their generation, hence the fear of disgrace swayes their hearts to
a more restrained life, from the grosser pollutions of the world, but
regeneration proceeds from other principles, not merely from education
(though that is a means many times appointed by God to further it) not from
ingenuity of nature, fear of ignominy, but from the work of Gods Spirit,
opening the eyes of the understanding, ransaking the conscience, and laying it
naked, subjugating the rebellious will, turning the streams of the affections
into the right channels, and upon the right objects, purifying and cleansing
the whole man in all the powers of the soul and members of the body, this
secret work that is known to few does Christ acquaint his Spouse with all,
that the Spouse is able to say concerning the recovery of Spiritual sight, and
other parts of regeneration, as the blind man of his corporal fight. John 9.25.
One thing I know and that by experience, that I was blind in my soul and now
I see, that I was dead in sin, but now I am alive and borne again unto God.

Voluntatis propensi autoritatem vitiis quaerit, and quod malum est bonum aut
bono proximum esse fuadet. Aug. Sermon. 12. de Tempore.
Father observes, persuading himself that the sin he is tempted unto is
either no evil, or not so great an evil as really it is. Hypocrit^ vitrum
ponit loco very margariti. Ifidorus Pelien siot. l. 2. Epist. 24.
An hypocrite (as one well observes) puts a glass in place of a pearl, that
is, shows forth his counterfeit and worthless performances as if they were
precious things, and if he has committed sin, with the harlot he wipeth
his mouth, saying what evil have I done? but when Christ once espouseth
himself unto a soul, he takes off the fair colors wherewith sin has
shadowed it self withal, and presents him to the soul in its own proper
shape and ugly hue: so as the Prophet Ahijah, 1 King. 14.6. discovered the wife
of Jeroboam disguised, so the soul endued with the Spirit of Christ can
discern the deformity of sin though never so cunningly and curiously
disguised by the Art of Satan: from this true sight of sin, arises that
detestation of sin in the heart of a Christian, that he thinks it a more
fearful sight to behold the horrid face of sin committed in his soul, than
to behold the Lake of Brimstone in the lowest hell: hence was it that holy Et
si multi gehennam omnium malorum supremum atque ultimum putant. Ego tamen sic
censeo, sic affiduo predicabo, multo acerbius esse Christum offendere, quam
gehennae malis vexari Chrysostom. in Mat. Hom. 37.
Chrysostom affirmed this to be a truth that he would daily Preach. That it
was a more bitter and intolerable thing to offend Christ than to be tormented
with the flames of hell it self.

Christ communicates to his Spouse is the vanity and emptiness of the
Creatures. Man looks upon the world, and the vanity thereof as a glorious and
amiable object, he looks upon worldly things as his substance, his profit,
his glory, but Christ shows unto his Spouse that riches in stead of being
glorious, are but as thick clay. Hab. 2.6. opened in what regard riches
compared to clay.
Hab. 2.6. which is, first a common thing at every man's door: secondly, a
soyling thing: thirdly, a slippery thing. So riches but common blessings,
polluting the possessors of them, and defiling their Consciences, slippery they
are also and inconstant, taking wings they fly away. Again Christ shows his
spouse that wordly things are not substance but shadows, Psalm. 39.6. not
profits but losses being compared with the true gain, Luke 16.11.12. A
natural man priseth pleasure as his great Diana, preferment as the top of
happiness, but Christ's Spouse is acquainted with this secret by her husband,
that the one is vanity, and the other but a spiders web. He that is unskilful
in the Arts and Sciences and looks upon the earth, thinks it to be some
spacious and great body, and admires it for its immensity: but let the
Mathematitian come and compare the earth and the heavens together, he knows
upon infallible demonstrations, that the body of the earth is but like a (...),
Arist. l. 1. Meteorolog. c. 14.
point or nothing being compared with the circumference of the heavens: So let
a man never instructed by Christ; look upon earthly things, he admires them
for their excellency; but let a Christian (whom Christ has taught this lesson
of the vanity of the creature) come to judge of these outward and sublunary
things and compare them with heavenly things, with grace, with Christ, with
glory, with heaven, he finds them being weighed with these to be lighter
than vanity it self. Let Paul be judge, who accounted all things but dung in
regard of Christ.

The fifth secret is the excellency of Christ. Mark. 4.11. Christ tells his
Disciples that to them it was given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
God; but to them that were without all things were done in Parables, that
seeing they might not see, etc. a natural man perceives not the things of God
and those glorious excellencies that are in Christ: though there be abundance
of light, beauty, and glory in the Sun, yet a man that is borne blind cannot
see any of them: it is so with the natural man in regard of the Son of
Righteousness.

Cant. 5.9. There are some that asks Christ's Spouse what she saw in her
beloved, that made her sick of love, thereby intimating that they for their
parts saw no such amiablenesse in him, but the spouse answers that she saw
something in him that did attract her heart to him, My beloved says she, is
white and ruddie, the chiefest of ten thousand: though the men of the world see
nothing in Christ desirable and amiable, yet his spouse sees his eminent
excellencies which Christ reveals to her by his Spirit, and therefore Mat.
16.17. Peter confesses Christ to be the Son of God, and so perceiving
salvation by him alone. Christ tells him that flesh and blood had not revealed
that unto him, but his Father which is in heaven, the excellencies in Christ
discerned only of the Saints, are prised and desired only of them, hence was
it that Peter desired to abide in Christ's presence; Lord whether shall we go?
thou have the Words of eternal life: and having but a taste of Christ's
excellency and glory in the transfiguration, he cried, It is good to be here.
Peter had been in many excellent places for pleasure and delight, but never
said before, It is good to be here: forgetting wife, lands, and living he
cries. It is good to be here, so sweet is the presence of the Lord Jesus,
especially when the soul obtaines a sight of his excellencies.

A sixth secret is the gain Tim. 6. A man of this world thinks there is no
profit but in purchasing of Lands and revenewes, no honor but in the favor of
earthly Potentates, no beauty but that of the body, no pleasure but in
Epicurisme, surfeiting, drunkenness, chambering, and wantonness; but Christ
shows his spouse again in godliness. Secondly, honor in being in favor at
the Court of heaven. Thirdly, beauty in grace: and lastly pleasure in walking
in the ways of this Christ had taught blessed Paul: Phil. 3.7.
those things that were gain to him he counted loss for Christ, Christ being
sufficient gain to him as he avoucheth, Phil. 1.21.
For me to live is Christ Secondly, honor in the favor of God, this the
Psalmist was acquainted withal. Psalm. 149.9. concluding the Psalm with this
Epiphonema: Such honor have all his Saints. This Saint Luke knew well, who
styles Theophilus a lover of God, most Noble Theophilus, Luke 1.3. and the
Bereans more honorable than them of Thessalonica for their piety and devotion,
this David knew well when he desired rather to be a door keeper in the house
of God, than to dwell in the tents of the ungodly. Thirdly, Beauty in Non
deformitate corporis animius faedatur sed pulchritudine animi ^ corpus ornatur.
Senica.
this secret Solomon knew when he affirms Eccles. 8.1. Wisdom makes the
face to shine. Lastly, pleasure in the ways of God, and the paths Solomon
avoucheth, Prove. 3.17. The ways of Wisdom are pleasantness, and all her
paths peace, this David witnesses, Psalm. 119. Thy testimonies are my delight,
sweeter unto me than the honey and honey comb: to this purpose cried holy
Augustine; O luxuriose ubi major delectatio quam in Gemme dulcissimo deo, Aug.
O thou luxurious fellow, where is there greater pleasure to be found than in
the sweetest God, and in his service; this mystery cannot enter into the heart
of a naturall-man, that there should be such pleasure in the ways of God, Tam
amant legem quam homicida carcerem.
who ordinarily loves the house of God, and the Laws of God as a Murderer
does the prison: as Luther was wont to say: a natural man finds no more
sweetness in Christ and his ways, than there is taste in the white of an
egg. Job 6.6. or than Barzillai found in the meat that King David would have
given him to eat, 2 Samuel 19.35. but the Spouse of Christ having had a taste of
Gods goodness, and an experimental relish of the ways of God, and the
pleasures thereof, affirms of Gods service in general, as David did of his
service in Gods house; One day in Gods Courts are better than a thousand. So
that as Christ said to his Disciples: he had bread they knew not of, which was
to do the will of his Father in heaven, the like may a believer say to a
worldly and sinful man, he has meat and drink, pleasure and recreation
that they know not of, neither did ever taste, which is to do the will, and
walk in the paths of Christ his Lord and husband.

A seventh secret is a taste so the godly many times have a taste of that
inutterable and infinitely delightful joy in heaven, before they take full
possession thereof: the spies that went into Canaan brought back with them
some clusters of Grapes, to show the fruitfulness of the land. Christ in like
manner gives the soul some clusters of Grapes, some taste of that goodness of
Canaan above, that his Spouse feeling the delight of that Country, may not
desire any continuing City here, but look for one that is above: this taste of
heaven sometimes God has given to his Saints in an extraordinary manner, as he
did to Paul in his rapture into the third heaven, unto Steven when the heavens
were opened and he saw the Son of God standing on the right hand of his
Father, which extraordinary revelations with all other Euthusiasmes,
Anabaptisticall dreams and fancies, God communicates not to his Saints in this
latter age of the world: therefore a second and ordinary way whereby God shows
the soul a sight of heaven, and a taste of the pleasure thereof is by the eye
of faith, by the assurance of Salvation, by the witness of the Spirit with our
own Spirit, by giving the soul such an inward sense and feeling of his
favor, and such a steadfast hope upon solid grounds of heaven, by beginning
heavenly Music by of a good conscience, and by raising up the soul by the
unspeakable peace of God, and joy of the Holy Ghost: by these and the like
means does God give the soul a taste of heaven, and as Moses upon Pisgah saw
Canaan, so in these as upon Pisgah does Christ carry his Spouse to see Canaan
that is above, the jointure that he will install his spouse into.

The second consequent on Christ's part.
The second consequent on Christ's part is a communication of goods, as a man by
his marriage endues his wife with all his worldly goods, so Christ endues his
spouse with his goods. All things are common, says the Anima quae diligit Deum
sponsa vocatur haec enim duo nomina, sponsa and sponsus, maxim in^icant
internos affectus, hic enim omnia communia sunt, una haereditas, una domus, una
mensa, unus lectus, una caro. Bern sermon. 7. in Cantio.
Father, betwixt man and wife, one inheritance, one house, one Table, one bed,
one flesh: the goods that Christ communicates to his Spouse are of three sorts.
First external, there is communication of outward comforts so far forth as
shall conduce to his own glory and the good of his spouse. Hosea 2.21. In that
day, to wit of his marriage with his people, I will hear the heavens, the
heavens shall hear the earth, the earth shall hear the corn, wine, and oil,
and they shall hear Israel: and the Apostle speaking of the believing
Corinthians, to whom Christ was espoused, tells them 1 Cor. 2.21. All things
were theirs, Paul, Apollos, things present and to come: the ground of this was
because they were Christ's and Christ Gods. Secondly, internal. In Christ to
his Spouse there is a communication of grace. John 1.16. Of his fullness we
receive grace for grace: in Christ there is a fullness of grace, there is not
only (...) a sufficiency, but (...) a redundancie of grace, as Plato
distinguishes. In Christ, there is not only the fullness of a vessel that
may be full in it self, but if it part with any liquor to other vessels, its
own proper fullness is diminished, but also there is a fullness of a fountain
that is not only full in it self and for it self, but it can communicate to
others in its fullness without diminution of its own proper fullness, this
kind of fullness is in Christ the fountain of grace and inexhastible
wel-spring of Life, this fullness of grace in Christ was that oil wherewith
he is said to be anointed above his fellows, and not by measure, for that
oil was not any typical and Sacramental oil, wherewith the Priests,
Prophets, and Kings were anointed in the Old Testament, but the Spiritual
oil of Gods grace, called the oil of gladness, which oil was powered on
Christ's head in so plentiful a manner that like the ointment powered on Aarons
head, it went down to the skirts of his garment. Psalm. 133.2. so this oil of
Gods grace powered on Christ the head of his spouse distills into the skirts of
his garment, into his meanest member, so that there is no humility, meekness,
patience, love, heavenly mindedness nor any other grace in Christ, but some
influence of that grace distills into the heart of every one espoused unto him,
hence the Apostle affirms 2 Cor. 9.8. that God is so full of grace, and has
such a sufficiency, that is, fullness to others: in the original the Apostle
emphatically expresses this by triplicating the word (...). 2 Cor. 9.8. opened.
First, (...), not in one, but in every necessity. Secondly, (...), not
sometimes but at every time. Thirdly, (...), not some sufficiency, but a
sufficiency of every grace. Eternal. In Christ there is a communication of
glory to his spouse. Christ will have no glory in heaven but in part, and so
far forth, as his spouse is capable of, he will Anina quae nunc pannoso
vestitu, ac servili habitu regi putatur, in regno caelorum regina and nobilis
Regi astans reperitur Basil. l. de vera. virg.
communicate that glory unto his spouse. So John 17.22.24. Christ says to his
Father, The glory which thou gave me I have given them, that they may be one
as we are one; and again, Father I will that they also whom thou have given
me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou have given
me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

The consequents ex part sponsae, The consequents ex part sponsae.
or on the believers part, follow which are two

First a whole change.

Secondly, a familiar acquaintance with Christ.









There is a change of name in a woman newly espoused, Martia redire voleus ad
Catonu^ maritum, ait, da tautum nomen inane Connubii, liceat tumulo scripsisse,
Catonis Martia. Luc. l. 2.
women change their own name into the name of their husbands, so the Roman
women took the name of their husbands, so valor. l. 10 Isaiah. 4.1. John.
19.25.
Caja from her husband Cajus, Tullia from her husband Tullius, and the like. So
amongst the Jews Mary of Cleophas, to wit the wife of Cleophas: hence some
think the Spouse in the Canticles is called Sulamitis or Sulamite. q. d.
Solomonia from Solomon her husband. In like manner does Christ's Spouse change
her name being once married to him. Abram entering into covenant with God
changed his name into Abraham, Sarai into Sarah. Jacob prevailing with Christ
changed his name into Israel; Simon must be called Peter, Saul converted was
called Paul: so every soul espoused to Christ has a new name; of a child of
perdition called a son or daughter of God by adoption; of a limb of Satan a
member of Christ, of a vessel of wrath, a vessel of honor, of an aliant and
stranger from Christ becomes a Christian, so that as Naomi said in another
case: John 15.15.
Call me no more Naomi, but call me Marah, for the Lord has afflicted me: so
may the Spouse of Christ say on the contrary, call me no more Marah but Naomi
for the Lord has visited me, no more desolate and forsaken but Hephziba, but
Beulah, the delight of the Lord, the Spouse of Christ, May 62.4.5.
as the Prophet speaks.

delights of flesh and blood, which after his betrothing to Christ he abandons
and abhorres. The Apostle speaking to the believing Romans espoused to Christ.
Romans 6.21. affirms that they delighted in those things in their natural
estate, whereof being in Christ they were ashamed. What fruit had you in those
things whereof ye are now ashamed: the like change in that young convert of
whom S. Ambros. l. 2. de praviten. c. 2^
Ambrose makes mention which answered his quondam Curtizan that came to him with
this salutation, Ego sum: It is I: the blessed young convert newly espoused to
Christ answered, At Ego non sum Ego, I am not I. I am wholly changed into
another Man, of a sinner made a Saint, of a vassal of my base lusts made a
vessel of honor, and the very Spouse of the Lord Jesus Christ: such a change
was in Paul that Ananias wondered he should be sent to Saul when he heard what
evil he had done to the Saints, Acts 9.13.
and Paul himself confesses, Gal. 1.13. that (...) even above measure he had
made havocke of the Saints, yet the same Saul of a persecutor becomes a
Preacher, of an enemy he became a friend to Christ, the like change in Mary
Magdalen, whose soul was as a borough to harbor unclean spirits, as a cage
of unclean birds, and afterward was made a Temple of the holy Spirit, and her
heart a palace to entertain the Lord Jesus with the dearest affection: so
powerful is the Lord Jesus to make his Spouse like unto himself. Moses his
face may shine, but the glory of his face could not make his garments glorious
that were about him. Christ his body upon Mount Tabor was transfigured and the
glory thereof displayed it self through his very garments, and the same Jesus
Christ being now transfigured in full glory in heaven, is so full of grace,
that he can communicate grace to his meanest member. Moses may marry an
Ethiopian, but he cannot change her blackenesse; Christ making love to a
poor soul of an Ethiopian dye, full of Leopards spots, can so change this
soul and renew it day by day till he make it a pure virgin, and present it
unto himself without spot and wrinckle. Ephesians. 5.27. so the Lord affirms,
Ezekiel. 16.7.8. that when he passed by his people, he saw them wallowing in their
blood, but he soon washed them and made them beautiful.

fruitless and barren in good works, yet after this spiritual betrothing
grows fruitful and abundant in the work of the Lord. This the Apostle makes
the end of believers marriage with Christ, that they may bring forth Dum anima
adhaeret sponso suo, and audit verbum ejus, and ipsum complectitur, sine dubio
ab ipso semen suscipit, inde nascetur generosa progenies, inde pudicitia
orietur, inde justitia, inde patientia, inde mansuetudo, and charitas atque
omnium virtutum proles veneranda succedet. Origin. Hom. 20. in 25. Numb.
fruits unto God. Romans 7.4. and our Savior makes fruitfulness in good works
one fruit of a believers union with Christ. John 15.5. It cannot be denied but
that an unregenerate person not betrothed to Christ may do some works, and
bring forth some fruits good for the matter, but these works and fruits
brought forth before his spiritual Marriage, are but like the children a woman
bears before her marriage, which are bastards and illegitimate brats that
cannot inherit, so the good works of unregenerate men are illegitimate and
cannot Articles of Religion. Article. ^3.
inherit being brought forth out of Spiritual wedlock, and not flowing from
the right root, which is faith in Christ.

The second consequent on the believers part.
The second consequent on the believers part is a familiar acquaintance with
Christ, that a believer can upon all occasions in the greatest straights go
unto Christ, and make his wants known unto him. Such an acquaintance had Moses
with God. Joshua. 20.12.
Exodus 17.11. by the holding up of whose hand Israel prevailed: such an
acquaintance had Ioshuah, who by his prayer caused the Sun to stand still
upon Gibeon and the Moon in the valley of Ajelon, and such an acquaintance and
intimatenesse has the Spouse of Christ with Christ, that upon all occasions,
if any thing perplexe and molest the soul, it can go unto Christ and make its
case known unto him, with a full persuasion that he will relieve and comfort
it, neither has the soul acquaintance only with Christ, but by Christ with
the Father and the blessed Spirit: as Isaac taking Rebecca to be his wise
brought her into his mothers tent, Genesis 24.67: So Christ marrying a believing
soul, brings that soul into his Fathers presence to have acquaintance with
him; this the Apostle sweetly expresses. Ephesians. 3.12. Ephesians. 3.12. opened.
In whom we have boldness and access; the word boldness in the Original is
(...), and it signifies boldness of face in speaking, showing that a believer
by Christ has boldness to go to God by prayer, again the Apostle says, in
him, that is Christ, we have not only boldness but access: in the Original
it is (...), which signifies such an access which is by manuduction as Isaac
took Rebecca; so Christ takes the soul espoused to him by the hand, and leads
it into his Fathers presence, and into acquaintance with him, so that the soul
which before this spiritual marriage was a stranger to God, and God an angry
God with the soul through sin, now apprehends God in Christ reconciled and
an indulgent Father: and last of all the Apostle shows how the believer has
this boldness of speech, this access, and this confidence, it is by faith of
him, faith is the eye of the soul by which the soul looks upon God
reconciled. Now as to the bodily sight there is required not only a well
disposed Organ, but a Arist. l. 2. de Anima. c. 7.
perspicuous medium, a lightsome air or the like, through which the species of
the visible object, must be received into the Organ of the eye: so in the
spiritual sight of the soul which it has of God, there is required a
diaphanous and perspicuous medium, which is Christ the mediator, through whom
the soul by faith sees him that is invisible, it is Christ that draws near
unto God for his friends. John 20.17. and they draw near to God by Christ.
Heb. 10.19.22. The application of this subject.

dignity it is to match into the stock of God even unto his only begotten
son, and so to be called the Kings daughter, Psalm. 45. The Kings Spouse and
beloved; well may the soul enter into an holy admiration of this favor; and
cry out with the Psalmist, Lord what is man? or the Son of man that thou so
regardest him, and have crowned him with so great a favor, as to be called
the Spouse of Christ; who (as Abigail said to David offering marriage) I am not
worthy to wash the feet of the Lords Servants. It was a great dignity for Ruth
to be espoused to Boaz; but a greater honor and favor for a poor soul to
be married to Christ, whose nature is goodness, whose greatness is
infiniteness, whose power is omnipotency, whose work is mercy, whose anger
is justice, whose throne is sublimity, whose will is equity, whose life is
felicity, and whose age is eternity. Let the heavens stand amazed at this
honor and favor without (...). Arist. l. 1. Oec. c. ^.
Philosopher could say that dissimilitude of manners, and diversity of carriage
is not apt either to beget or preserve love and delight: so that Christ may
take content and delight in his Saints espoused unto himself, they must adorn
themselves whereby they may become like unto him, he is clothed with
holiness and righteousness as with a garment, he is full of beauty and
enamouring comeliness, that like then may rejoice in like, the soul must be
adorned that Christ may say of the soul as Sampson did of Dalilah. Judge. 14.3.
She pleases me well; this the Psalmist sweetly expresses, Psalm. 45.14. The
Kings daughter shall be brought unto the King in a raiment of needle work, so
shall the King, that is Christ, take pleasure in her beauty: if it be asked
what this needleworke of diverse colors is. I answer not any outward ornament
mentioned Esaias 3.18.19.20. not that strange apparel condemned by the Prophet,
Zephan. 1.8. (...). Arist. l. 2. Oeconom. c. 1.
These outward ornaments are not the ornaments wherewith Christ's Spouse must be
clothed, that Christ may take delight in her, these make the soul many times
more deformed in the sight of Christ, these are the worlds Livery, which the
servants of the world for the most part are clothed withal; therefore the
Psalmist, Psalm. 45.13. expresses what the ornaments of Christ's Spouse are. The
Kings daughter is all glorious within, the (...).
Septuagints read the words thus; All the glory of the Kings daughter is
within. A believer in outward appearance has little glory, therefore the
Church complains. Cant. 1.5. I am black but comely, black in the opinion of
the world not seeing my beauty which is inward; black through persecution and
the scorching flames thereof, but comely in the eyes of Christ, who looks on
my inward beauty that cannot be seen by the world: so then the inward In sola

ornaments wherewith Christ's Spouse must adorn her self are the heavenly
dispositions, virtues, qualities, and graces of the soul; as humility,
meekness, temperance, chastity, brotherly kindness, heavenly mindedness,
and the like. This the Apostle intimates, Col. 3.12.13. Put on therefore as the
elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of
mind, meekness, long suffering, etc. put on, the word in the original is
(...), put on as a garment or ornament, and the garment it self is a
concatination of graces, a troop of heavenly virtues; as mercy, kindness,
humility, etc. this is the needle work of diverse colors wherewith the Kings
daughter must be adorned when she is presented to the King, called a needle
work of diverse colors, in regard of the variety of graces that this
needle-worke consists of, as also noteing the glory of this ornament of grace
and holiness, for as diversity of colors in needleworke, so variety of graces
make a soul more beautiful and glorious, every grace having its distinct
beauty and luster, and all of them being joined together in one soul, one
grace gives a glory unto another, all of them together shining in the soul,
like so many diamonds in a Ring. Secondly, Corinthians, that he was jealous
over them with godly jealousy; for he had espoused them to one husband, 2 Co^.
11.2.
that he might present them as a chaste virgin to Christ, and this jealousy
that Paul had over the believing Corinthians, should every believing soul have
over it self, that Christ may have no occasion to be jealous of the souls
entire affection to himself alone: therefore more than ordinarily vigilant
must the Saints be that are espoused to Christ, to avoid spiritual
fornication, which is Si susceperi:, o homo, in cubili animae tuae adulterum
diabolum, meretricata est anima tua cum diabolo, si spiritus irae, si invidiae,
si superbiae, si impudicitiae ingressus fuerit ad animam tuam, and receperis
cum, and consenseris ei loquenti, and in cord tuo delectatus fueris his, quae
tibi secundum suam mentem suggerit, meretricatus es cum eo. Origin hom. 12. in
Levit. c. 2. In nulla part oportet virginem adulteram esse, non lingua, non
auribus, non oculo, non alio omnino sensu, imo neque cogitatione, sed corpus

de vera virg.
committed when the soul prostitutes it self to the least sin, and
entertaines the least lust with consent and delight. If thou shall receive,
says Origin, into the chamber of thy soul the devil, thy soul has played
the adulteress with the devil, if the spirit of anger, envy, pride,
immodestie, and the like shall enter into thy soul, and thou shall entertain
and hearken unto it, and be delighted with it and the suggestions thereof, thou
have committed whoredom with it. Although the soul may commit spiritual
adultery with any sin, yet more hainously with these three particular sins.

First, with Idololatria est mystica and spiritualis animae cum idolis
fornicatio. Com. a Lap. in Ezekiel. 6.9.
Idolatry, for Isay 42.8. I am Jehovah and my glory will not I give to
another; and of this does the Lord often complain that his people had gone a
whoring after Idols and strange gods. Levit. 17.7. Ezekiel. 6.9. Neither is there
any one kind of Spiritual fornication more distasteful to the Bridesgroome of
the soul, than for the soul to be difiled with this sin, therefore Ezekiel.
36.25. it is joined with filthiness, from all your filthiness, and from all
your Idols, will I cleanse you, says the Lord.

Secondly, with covetousness and inordinate Mundi amor and Dei, pariter in tuo
cord cohabitare non possunt, quemadmodum iidem oculi coelum pariter and terram
nequaquam aspiciunt. Aug. (vel quisquis est auctor) libro de duodecim
abusionibus gradu. 7.
love of the world, this is the second sin with which the soul more
hainously commits spiritual fornication: this the Apostle James clears,
James 4.4. Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the
world is an enemy of God, this spiritual adultery with the world is so much
more grievous than carnal adultery; by how much God, who is contemned is more
great and excellent than man to whom a wife has betrothed her self.

A third sin is corporal Cor. 6.15. the Apostle shows this, affirming that
a man by this sin takes the members of Christ and makes them the members of
an Harlot: this sin by Gods own verdict takes away the heart. Hosea 4.11.
and so alienates the affection from the Lord Jesus. Behold then the duty of the
Saints, as to avoid all sin; so especially these three sins with which
especially and more grievously, the soul commits spiritual fornication; as
also to present themselves as chaste Virginitas mentis est integra fides,
solida spes, sincera charitas, Aug. 11.13. in Johan. Iom. 9.
virgins to the Lord Jesus Christ their dearest bridesgroome: This point
instructs the Saints in a third duty to walk before Christ in all manner of
well pleasing; propounding Christ's word and example as a pattern of their
lives. This duty of a wife the Heathen (...), Arist. l. 2. Oeconom. c. 1.
(...). Hesiod.
Philosopher found out, affirming that a well ordered woman ought to esteem
the carriage of her husband to be a Law of her life imposed by God, though this
rule fail in case the manners of the husband be ungodly and corrupt, yet in
the present instance betwixt Christ and his Spouse it fails not, Christ's life
being a pattern of purity and perfect holiness and absolute obedience in
every particular: therefore says Nupsisti Christo incede scoundum sponsi tui
voluntatem. Tertul. de velandis, virg. c. 16.

Christianismus est invitatio divinae naturae. Nyssen. tract. de profess.
Chrystia.


Tertullian. Halt thou married thy self to Christ, walk according to the will
of thy husband: this observancie and pleasing carriage was eminent in the
Church. Psalm. 123.2. Behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of
their Master, and as the eyes of a maiden, unto the hand of her Mistress, even
so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God. Christ would have his Spouse to be
known to be his Spouse, even by her outward carriage, by her holiness
toward God, and righteousness toward man, by her meek, humble, courteous
and merciful carriage toward al, expressing in her life, the life of her
husband Christ.

1. Symptom.
A soul married to Christ is dejected and grieved, for the want of the sense
of Christ's presence in the soul. Mat. 9.13. Our Savior makes this an evident
property of the Spouse of Christ, that she fasts and mournes at the departure
of the bridegroom. The Disciples of John asked Christ why they fasted, but his
Disciples fasted not, Christ seems to tell them that they had reason to fast
and mourn because their Master was now in prison, and they deprived of his
presence, but as yet his Disciples enjoyed the presence of their Master, the
delightful residence of their endeared Bridegroom, but the time should come
that the case should be altered, that I the Bridegroom of their souls shall
be taken from them, and then they should fast and mourn, that being a fit time
for dejection and sadness of heart; now as it was with the Disciples of Christ
in regard of Christ's corporal presence, so it is with every believer in regard
of Christ's spiritual presence, they enjoyed for a while his corporal
presence, exceedingly rejoicing in the fruition of it, drinking in with great
delight the gracious words and saving doctrine that flowed from his blessed
lips, with great admiration, beholding his glorious miracles which he did by
his divine power, but when once this blessed bridegroom of their souls was
taken from them, it was a day of much heaviness and sadness, of fasting and
mourning; it is so with the believing soul in regard of Christ's spiritual
presence, sometimes Christ gives the soule^ sensible feeling and apprehension
of his sweetest residence in it, at which time the soul takes a full draught
of unspeakeable and ravishing joy, at other times Christ for some reasons best
known unto himself, withdrawes himself in regard of any sense and feeling of
his presence by the soul: now at this time the souls former songs are turned
into sighs, its melody into mourning, its feasting into fasting, all its
former joy for the presence of Christ its Bridegroom, into saddest dejection
for the withdrawing of the Bridegroomes presence; hence it is that the Spouse
of Christ is so often in Scripture called a Dove, which is of a mournful
nature, when she wants the Society of her mate; Cant. 2.14. Esaias 38.14. Esaias
58.11.
of the like carriage is Christ's Spouse in the absence of Christ, see the
Churches carriage, Cant. 3.1.2.3. ^ened.
Cant. 3.1, 2, 3. By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loved, I sought
him, but I found him not. By night, that is, by solitary and deepest
meditation, upon my bed, that is, when she thought her self sure of her
beloved, supposing him to be with her, she misseth his company, then she by her
meditation and prayer, falls a seeking of him but finds him not: does she not
sit still as content to be deprived of the presence of her bridegroom? No,
she now resolves to arise and to go about the City and the streets,
(noteing her diligent search) to seek him whom her soul loved, and yet she
finds him not, will she yet leave off enquiring having lost so much labor?
No, she resolves upon a third enquiry after Christ of the Watchmen, and
keepers, to wit, of the Ministers of Christ, and yet not finding Christ she is
yet impatient of Christ's delay and absence, neither the society of her
brethren, or of Ministers could comfort her troubled spirit for the want of
Christ, and therefore she still persists in her seeking till at last she found
him to her souls refreshing: behold in this instance the true Character of the
Spouse of Christ, that she is affected with the loss of his presence, and
will not be satisfied without the fruition of it again. would thou then, O
doubtful soul, be assured that thou art espoused to Christ: examine how thy
heart stands affected for the want of the inward apprehension of Christ's
presence in thy soul; if wanting Christ's residence thou can be of a
cheerful heart, of a careless mind toward Christ, of a slow and secure
carriage in seeking of him in his Word, Sacraments, or any other of his
Ordinances, it is an evident sign as yet thou never enjoyest such an husband
as Christ, who after his espousalls with the soul leaves such an impression of
his love, and such a liking of his presence and communion, that let the soul
be deprived but a while of Christ, it cannot rest till it has gotten him
again by the nearest embracings of Faith.

A second symptom of desires the consummation of the marriage in heaven, where
she may rest and repose her self, in a more near communion, in the arms and
bosom of Jesus Christ: although the soul be betrothed unto Christ upon
earth, yet the fellowship is not so great, and communion so intimate with
Christ upon earth, as the soul shall have with Christ in heaven.

Hence Saint Iam desponsata es illl, o anima, jam nuptiarum prandium
celebratur; nam cana quidem in caelo paratur. Born. Sermon. 2. Dom. 1. post.
Epiph.
Bernard affirms that in this life the marriage dinner is only celebrated,
but in heaven the marriage Supper is prepared, where the soul shall be fed
with rarer dainties and be satisfied even to a spiritual inebriation, with the
fullness of Gods house. In this life, whilst the Marriage dinner is only
celebrated, there may be want of wine, as at the Marriage of Cana in Galilee,
Christ himself being present, but not at the Marriage supper in heaven, though
in Cana yet not in Canaan above.

At the Marriage in Cana of Galilee, although the mother of Jesus told him of
the want of wine, John 2.4. opened.
that he might see the scarcity supplied; yet Christ answered her, his hour
was not yet come, that is, the convenient time of doing that Miracle was not
yet come; but when the Master of the Feast and Bridegroom began to be ashamed
of their scarcity, and that the Miracle might the better be taken notice of,
then Christ gave him plenty enough. In like manner in this life, whilst the
marriage dinner lasts, there may be want of wine, that is, want of the sense of
Christ's presence, his favor and love, and therefore the Spouse cries, Cant.
2.5. Stay me with flaggons, and the reason is, because the hour is not yet
come when Christ uses to give the soul such plenty, but he reserves that
plenty for heaven, when he fills the soul with the wine of inconceivable
pleasure and joy in his presence, when he will turn all the waters of
afflictions, into the wine of consolation, and the soul shall have access to
Christ, the fountain of all comforts, there to fill and satisfy it self with
what the heart is capable of, there being then a more intimate communion
betwixt Christ and a believer in heaven, than upon earth, a more intimate
fellowship and a fuller participation of that unspeakeable content that the
soul takes in Christ; the soul cannot but Quemadmodum Iacobus magna cum
alacritate migravit in Egyptum ut ibi videret gloriam Iosephi. Genesis 45.18. sic
nos ad caelum properemus ut ibi videamus gloriam Christi Chem. Harm. Evang. p.
1679.
long for and desire with Paul to be dissolved and to be with Christ: with
Jacob it cannot but wait for the Salvation of God: with Simeon it cannot but
desire to depart in peace, where it may see Christ face to face, and never lose
that beatificall vision of him again. Hence was it that good Quid hic
faciemus? cur non ocyus migramus? cur non hinc avolamus?
Monica the mother of Augustine cried, what do we here? why depart we not
swifter? why fly we not away from hence? Hence was it that her son Mori
desidero ut videam Christum salutare meum: vivere renuo ut cum Christo vivam.
Chem. ha^m. Evang. p. 1675.
Augustine said, I desire to dye, that I may see Christ my Savior, I refuse to
live, that I may live with Christ. It is with a believing soul in this life,
as with a man in a journey in a strange Country, who though at his Inn, where
he lodges, he has a warm Chamber, good fire, wholesome victuals, a soft and
refreshing bed, yet he is ever and then thinking on home, his thoughts and
meditations ever and then speaking thus within him: true it is, I have a good
lodging, kind entertainment, wholesome victuals, but what are all these to
my fare at home, my bed at home, to the society of my wife and children at
home, home though homely is ever in his mind, ever in his desires: so it is
with a Christian espoused to Christ, though he enjoyes a confluence of all
outward comforts, though he takes great delight in this life, and as it were
swimmes in all worldly contentments; having a loving wife, dutiful children,
faithful servants, his barnes stuffed with grain, his pastures stockt
abundantly with Oxen and sheep, his coffers replenished with the most precious
of metalls, so that he lackes nothing that can give an honest heart content,
yet he cannot but be ever and then thinking within himself, I have wife,
children, lands, livings, but what are these to the society with my sweetest
Savior, and most delightful Bridegroom; desiring to leave all to be with
Christ which is best of all. Examine thy heart, O soul, by this property. Is
there any thing in the world so dear unto thee, be it wise, son or daughter,
land or house, yea life it self, that thou art not content to leave, that thou
may have that intimate communion with Christ in heaven? Thou may justly
fear thou never wast espoused to Christ, neither ever had any acquaintance
with him, for if thou had, the best of worldly excellencies could not retain
thy soul from a desire to be with Christ in heaven.

In the third place, 3. Symptom.
this Spiritual marriage is discovered by the affection of love. (...) etc.
Aust. l. 2. Oeconom. c. ultima.
A soul married to Christ loves all that have any alliance with Christ. A
wife that truly loves her husband, loves her husbands kindred and friends, in
like manner are the friends of Christ dear unto his Spouse: now who they be
that have alliance and friendship with him Christ himself declares. First,
that those are his brethren, Mark 3.35. who do the will of God, whose Father
is his Father, whose God is his God; and for his friends Christ shows who they
be, John 15.14. Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you: as it was
betwixt Iehosaphat and Ahab. 2 King. 3.7. when they agreed together to go
against Moab to battle, Iehosaphat said, I am as thou art, my people as thy
people, my horses as thy horses, so is it with all the members of Christ that
are espoused to him. Christ's cause is their common cause; Christ's friends their
friends, embracing Christ with the dearest affection, and mutually one another
for Christ's sake. By this may thou examine thy self whether thou be
espoused to Christ or not, to wit, by thy love to all those that stand in the
same relation to Christ as thou do: see thou a poor member of Christ, in
the wrinckles of whose face, as in so many lines, thou may read Lectures of
misery and want; here is a friend of Christ, if thou be the Spouse of
Christ, thou can not but have some pity, love, and compassion on this his
friend, see thou any eminent for grace, holy in life, frequent in duty,
zealous for piety and purity of heart, this is a friend of Christ, standing in
the same relation to Christ, as thou do, if thou be espoused to him, and
therefore thou can not but love him for the image of Christ thou see in him.

In the third place, the consideration Spouse in many particulars. Kings 4.1.2.
complains that the Creditour was come to take her sons captives; but the
Spouse of Christ needs fear no such arrest of any creditour, the soul has
many creditours that out of Christ it is subject and liable to satisfy: the
Law arrests the soul, with a cursed is every one that continues not in all
things that are written in the Law to do them, Gal. 3.10. Again Conscience
arrests the soul and seconds the Law with this assumption, that the soul has
not continued in the Law but broken it: the Devil will arrest the soul with
many accusations; Death and Hell have their arrests too, but Christ being the
husband of the soul, becomes the undertaker for all these arrests and debts by
sin, Satan, Conscience, Death, or Hell; when the Law shall urge its (...)
and rigorous exaction of perfect obedience, then may the believing soul
answer, my husband Christ has paid it for me: when the Law calls for penalty
upon the violation of it self, the believer may answer, Christ my husband
has paid it for me, who is made unto me wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
and redemption, and as the Apostle speaks, 1 Timothy 2.6. gave himself not only
(...) but (...) a ransom, but a counter-ransome for all my sins, and thus in
all other arrests may the soul stop all in Christ: so that as good Onesimus
was loath to return to his Master Philemon, to whom once he had been an
unprofitable servant, but when once he knew that Paul had written his Epistle
to Philemon, to tell him that whatsoever Onesimus owed him he should set it on
Paul's score, Philem. v. 18.
Onesimus might then with boldness return to his Master Philemon again: in
like manner a poor soul considering how it has offended God, is loath to
come before or into his presence: but when it considers again that whatsoever
it is indebted to God it is set on Christ's score, then may the soul with
boldness go to God, and stop the mouth of all accusers in the world, who can
lay nothing to the charge of Gods elect, seeing it is God that justifies.

Secondly, this may comfort to the utmost. Protection is one privilege the
wife has by her husband, therefore says Ruth to Boaz, Ruth. 3.9. opened.
Spread thy skirt over thine handmaide, for thou art a near kinsman: Spread
thy skirt over me, that is, be my protector in being my husband; Christ will
not be wanting to his Spouse in any comfort or succor that a wife expects from
her husband, much less in protection, one of the meanest duties of a loving
husband, therefore Ezekiel. 16.8. when once the time was, the time of love betwixt
the Lord and his people, he says, he spread his skirt over his people, and
covered their nakedness; let then the Spouse of Christ be daily assaulted by
Satan, the world, and the remainder of corruption, and let the soul go to
Christ, as Ruth to Boaz, Spread thy skirt over thy servant, for thou art my
husband, Lord, and Master, and the Spouse of Christ shall be safe under the
wings of Christ, that all the powers of darkness, and powers of hell it
self, shall not be able to pull Christ's Spouse out of his Arms.

This may comfort the believing soul, that being once espoused it shall be for
ever espoused to Christ, Hosea 2.19. I will betroth thee unto my self for
ever, says the Lord unto his people. Ruth. 3.^.
Naomi may be deprived of her husband Elimelech in a strange land, because
Elimelech was a man subject to the like mortality as all of his own species
are, but the soul once married to Christ can never be deprived of him, who
being both God and man, is he who was, and is, and shall be unto all eternity,
so that which Babylon said in a proud and presumptuous manner, Esaias 47.8. I
shall not see widdow-hood, that upon good grounds and not presumptuously may
the soul espoused to Christ affirm of it self: I shall sit as Queen and
never suffer spiritual Widdow-hood, so that the condition of believers in this
marriage estate with Christ, is far better than that of Adam in Paradise. Man
in his innocence was espoused to God, but then God left in man a power to
dissolve this matrimonial knot, and man breaking the Covenant there was a
dvorce drawn, now God is so far pleased out of his super-abundant mercy and
compassion (not to be found in any but a God infinitely good) to treat of a
second marriage to the soul of man divorced from him, Ier. 3.^.
which marriage is grounded upon a more sure foundation even upon Christ, and
in Christ he is pleased to be married to the soul, not for a certain time to
be at last expired, but for all eternity, not now leaving the Matrimonial
covenants in man's own custody, but undertaking the keeping of them himself.
To conclude this, if it be such an happy thing for man and wife so to live
together, Faelices ter and amplius quos irrupta tenet copula, nec malis
divulsus querimoniis suprema citius solvit a nor dic. Hor.
that the bond of love be not broken till death it self does break it, then
far greater happiness and comfort for a believing soul to think, that this
bond of Spiritual wedlock shall not be broken by death it self, but remain
indissolveable to all eternity.

Israel, a stranger from God, from his promises, his Christ, that he would
accept of Jesus Christ to be the husband of his soul, and so his soul may be
the Spouse of Christ, and so have interest in all the saving promises of the
Gospel, and be made a member of the Commonwealth of Israel, and of one that
was a far off made nigh to God in Christ by Spiritual alliance. John 3.29.
the Baptist styles himself a friend of the Bridegroom. 2 Cor. 11.2. Paul, as
the (...) or spokesman of Christ, tells the Corinthians that he was jealous
over them, for he had espoused them to one husband that he might present them
as a chaste virgin to Christ. Every Minister of the Gospel with the Baptist
should be a friend of the Bridegoome, with Paul a spokesman for Christ, this
the Apostle shows, 2 Cor. 5.20. that he and the rest of his function were
Ambassadors for Christ, as though Christ did entreat others by them to be
reconciled to him; for as great persons, as Emperors and Kings, dwelling in
remote places from the virgin Ladies whom they would espouse unto themselves,
send entreaties of marriage by their Ambassadors, who use to carry their lively
pictures and portratures of their persons, and so present them to the women
they desire to be espoused unto: in like manner the Lord Jesus the great King,
whose Throne endures for ever, and whose Scepter is a right Scepter, keeping
his Court in heaven and that being his glorious Throne where his chief
residence is, and his greatest glory displayed, he offering conditions of
Marriage to poor souls, sends them by the Ministers of the Gospel his
Ambassadors, and has put into their hands the word of his Gospel (Christ's
love Letter) in which his glorious excellencies and treasures of incomparable
benefits, dwelling in him in a plentiful manner are evidently set forth, which
the Ambassadors of Christ opening and declaring to the people, cannot but show
forth the excellencies of his person, of his riches, honor, beauty, and all
other desirable qualities in a Bridegroom. Oh then that God would be pleased
(having appointed me an unworthy messenger to this great dignity as to be his
spokesman) to make me an instrument of persuading some poor, blind, and naked
souls to accept of Christ to be their husband, who is able to enrich them with
what their souls can desire, and now what arguments shall I use to persuade
such to this Marriage? Genesis 24.35.36.
Abraham's servant going to take a wife for his Masters son Isaac that he
might persuade Rebecca and her friends the more forceably, the one to go with
him, and the other to part with her, he tells them that the Lord had blessed
his Master Abraham greatly, etc. and so by this Argument obtaines his request
in persuading Rebecca to go with him, and her friends to part with her. The
great God of heaven employing me his unworthy servant to entreat a Spouse for
his son, I can use the same arguments that Abraham's servant did, I wish it
might be with the same success. My Master the Almighty God of Abraham, of
Isaac, and Jacob, is exceeding great (his greatness being infiniteness) and
he is exceeding rich, not only with Abraham in flocks and heardes, in silver
and gold, the cattle upon a thousand Mountains being his, Psalm. 50.12.
but he is the possessour of heaven and earth it self, the great Commander and
Sovereign Lord of the whole world, rich in himself, unspeakeable,
incomprehensible and inconceiveable glorious eminencies, and this God has one
only begotten son, and unto him has he given all his riches, as in the 2
Psalm, and the 8. verse. Ask of me and I will give thee the uttermost parts
of the earth for thy possession; the son of God installed into his Fathers
inheritances offers himself to be married to thy poor soul, whosoever thou
art, that wilt accept of him to be thy Bridegroom: Oh that thy soul with
Rebecca would accept of this match without farther delay! The (...). Arist.
Ethic. l. 9. c. 1.
Philosopher tells us that sometimes a lover finds fault that he loves above
measure, and yet is not loved again, whereas he has nothing in him that is
amiable or worthy of love. Christ indeed may complain that he offers love to
many a poor soul, and yet finds no love again; neither can the soul
allege this for a reason of unkindness to Christ again, that there is
nothing in Christ that is lovely; for in Christ there is nothing that is not
worthy of the greatest love that can lodge in a mortal breast: what lovely
quality can the soul desire in an husband, that are not in Christ? Does the
soul desire riches? With me are riches, Prove. 8.18. says Wisdom it self.
Does it desire Nobility of Birth? God the Father witnesses his sons Nobility.
Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee, Psalm. 2.7. Does it desire
beauty? Christ is fairer than the Sons of men, Psalm. 45.2. Desires the soul
power in an husband for protection? All power is given unto him of the Father,
twelve Legions of Angels are at his command, and Legions of Devils were
constrained to crouch unto him; hence also by the Prophet was he called
Wonderful and Powerful, Esaias 9.6. Desires the soul goodness in an husband?
Christ's lips are full of grace, Psalm. 45.2. He is a very fountain of
goodness. Desires it yet Wisdom? Christ is Wisdom it self, Wisdom of
the Father, and made Wisdom to every believer, 1 Cor. 1.30. Lastly, desires
it glory in an husband? Christ is the King of glory, Psalm. 24.8.10. The Apostle
remarkable sets down all these amiably qualities together, Heb. 1.2.3. God
has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, behold his Nobility, whom
he has appointed heir of all things, behold his Riches, by whom also he made
the world, behold his Wisdom, who being the brightness of his Fathers glory,
and express Image of his Person, there is his beauty and upholding all things
by the Word of his Power, when he had by himself purged our sins, there is
his goodness, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, there is
his glory. Moreover all these excellencies are in Christ, so they are in him in
a more Necessario efficitur in Deo omnium rerum in esse perfectiones, easque
perfectissimas perfectissimo modo. Zan. de natura Dei. l. 3. c. 7.
eminent manner. Many excellencies may be in the creatures by participation
from God, but they are not so in the creatures as in Christ: many excellencies
are sprinkled up and down in the Creatures, in an imperfect manner, as some
creatures excel in beauty, some in power, some in wisdom, but all these and
many more that are diverse and opposite perfections and virtues in the
Creatures, are al in Christ in a most perfect and eminent manner: there is as
the Apostle affirms One manner of glory in the Sun, another of the Moon,
another of the Stars; yet what glory the Moon has or the stars, they
receive it for the most part from the Sun, and all their glory meets in the
Sun in a full manner: so it is with the creatures in heaven, as of Angels and
Saints, another of creatures under the heaven, yet what glory is found in these
creatures they have it from God, and Christ the Son of Righteousness; and
meets in him as in a center of perfection, making one perfect excellency and
excellent perfection. And now O humane soul, what is there in the world in
which thou can find these things that are to be found in Christ? why do
thou then wed thy heart to riches, honor, pleasure, that Bern. sermon. in iliud.
Ecce nos reliquimus omnia. Anima, inquit, rationalis caeteris omnibus occupari
potest, repleri non potest. Anima rationalis facta est capax majestatis tuae,
ut a te solo, and a nullo alio possit repleri, Aug. in Soliloq. c. 30.
cannot satisfy thy soul, and slightest Christ in whom are treasures of
riches, supercoelestiall honor, inconceiveable pleasures? Why do thou give
Christ the lowest place in thy heart, that deserves the highest? Why put
thou the creature above the Creator, who at the first gave thee dominion over
the creature? What shall I say to persuade thee to forsake all other lovers, to
give entertainment to Christ, that he may espouse himself to thy soul? I
cannot speak more impressively than in the words of the Quid per multa
vagaris, ^omuncio quaerendo bona animae tur and corporis tui? Ama unum bonum in
quo sunt omnia bona, and sufficit: desidera simplex bonum, quod est omne bonum
and satis est. Aug. vel quisquu est auctor. l. de Spit. and Anima.
Father. Why do thou, O man, wander up and down by many things, by seeking
the good of thy soul and body? Love that one God in which are all good things,
and it suffices: desire that one good which is every good, and it is enough.
And now me thinks I perceive some soul, with Agrippa, almost persuaded to be
a Christian, to accept of Christ's offer, and willing to match with him, but yet
fearing and secretly saying within it self, I am afraid that Jesus Christ
will not match himself with me, who have nothing in me that may move Christ
to love me, and I find so much deformity in my soul by sin, so much
filthiness in my inward man, that Christ, I fear, will turn away his eyes
from me, as an unfit object of his love. To this I answer, what saw God in his
people that might move him to love them. Ezekiel. 16.5.6. They lay tumbling in
their blood, in their filthiness, and abominations, and then was the time of
love when God pitied them, and entered into covenant with them, and they became
his own. It is not with Christ as with a man, in choosing a Spouse: man looks
after proportion and portion: but Christ regards not the soul for any thing in
it self, for he has riches and beauty enough for himself, and the soul his
Spouse too: If the soul has any riches or righteousness of its own, Christ
will not marry himself unto it, and therefore the Apostle affirms that the
Israelites going about to establish their own righteousness, did not submit
themselves to the righteousness of God, which is the righteousness of Christ
laid hold on by faith, Romans 10.3.4. As therefore Abraham said, Genesis 14.23. unto
the King of Sodom, that he would not take from him so much as a thread, lest
the King of Sodom should say, I have made Abraham rich: so Christ, when he
Marries himself to any soul, he will not have with it the least
righteousness of his own, lest the soul should boast of it self, or that it
had any riches but what it got by its Marriage with Christ. Therefore in that
thou say thou art poor, base, blind, naked, miserable, and wretched, and
if withal thou art truly sensible of this thy poverty, thy filthiness and
wretchedness, touched also with a deep apprehension of thine own unworthines
to be joined in Marriage to Christ, thou have spoke a word ere thou were aware,
that may give thee comfort and hope, that thou art such a one to whom Christ
will espouse himself: were thou rich in thine own conceit as the Church of
Laodicea, Non habet quo intret gratia, ubi meritum occupavit. Bern. in Cantie.
Sermon. 67.
Christ would despise thee, but being vile in thine own eyes he will sooner
regard thee, who uses to fill the hungry with good things, and to send the
rich empty away: to resist the proud, but to give grace to the humble: there is
nothing that winnes respect more from God, than for the soul to be truly
humble. To him will I look, even to him that is of a contrite and humble
spirit: Isaiah. 57.15.
I dwell in the humble heart, though God dwells in the highest heavens, yet
withal in the lowest heart, and therefore says Mary: Luke 1.48. He had
respect to the low estate of his hand-maide. Excellent is the expression of
Holy Altus est Deus, humilis est Christianus. Si vult ut altus Deus v. cinetur
illi, ille humilis sit, magna mysteria, fratres, Deus super omnia est. Erigris
te and non illum tangis, humilias te, and ipse ad te descendit. Aug. in Psalm.
34.
Augustine to this purpose, God is high, (says he) a Christian is low, if he
desires that the high God should come near him, let him be lowly. A great
mystery: brethren (says he) God is above all; thou liftest up thy self and yet
touchest him not, thou humblest thy self, and he descends unto thee: so then
as Abigails speech to David desiring Marriage of her, that she was not worthy
to wash the feet of David's servants; allayed not David's affection, neither
hindered her preferment; neither will thy poverty (if thou be truly sensible
of it) hinder thy espousing to Christ, who, as the Nullum eligit dignum sed
eligendo efficit dignum. Aug. cont. Iuli. Pelag. l. 5. c. 3.
Father notes, chooses none worthy of himself, but by choosing them makes the
worthy. To conclud this: it was a good policy in the Gibeonites, Josh. 9.4, 5,
6. that they might move Ioshuah to enter into covenant with them, they workt
wittily, taking old sackes upon their Asses, and wine bottles old and rent, old
shoes and garments. It would be as good a policy for a poor soul in moving
Christ to enter into league and covenant with it, to come unto Christ with an
abased, naked and ragged heart, rent in pieces with deep contrition, and sense
of Gods wrath, for this is the most ready way, for the soul to find favor in
the eyes of Christ, whose order is first to deject, then to erect and raise up,
first to wound by the sense of misery, and then to heal by the sense of Mercy:
first to make the soul apprehensive of its own misery and then to bestow
himself upon the soul to enrich it.

But in the second place some poor soul may object:

To this I answer: he that truly accepts of Christ, must take him on his own
terms, to be the Lord and chief Commander of his soul, and the soul must
give a bill of divorcement to every sin, to give entertainment to Christ
alone, whereas then the soul pretends a willingness to accept of Christ, and
yet withal an unwillingnesse to part with some darling sin, the reason is
because the soul consults with flesh and blood, with corrupt nature, that
always (as Ahab said of Michaiah in another case) prophesies evil to the
soul, opposing it self against the eternal welfare thereof. Accept of me,
says Christ, to be the Bridegroom of thy soul, the soul asks counsel of
flesh and blood, whether it should obey in accepting of Christ: refuse says
flesh and blood, will thou forsake thy former delights, thy Dalilahs, in whose
lap thou have took so many a contentfull sleep, will thou forsake such a way
of gain, which has been the maintenance of thy self and family? Hereupon
the soul resolves upon a plain denial, or if not so, yet of an accepting,
but not on his own terms, yet Christ indeed shall be called the husband of
the soul, but withal resolves to retain its sins still, which in truth is
aequivalent to a plain refusal; would the soul then accept of Christ in his
own way, the best direction that can be given to the soul in such a case is,
that it should not consult with flesh and blood and corrupt nature in this
case, but to do as Paul did, Gal. 1.16. Who upon Gods call and the Revelation
of his Son, in him immediately obeyed, and consulted not with flesh and
blood. The (...). Arist. ^^eter. l. 1. c. 9.
Philosopher tells us, it is absurd to consult about things that must be done
of necessity: now there is nothing of greater necessity than for the soul to
accept of Christ: does Christ then offer himself unto thee, resolve upon an
immediate embracing of his love. Does he bid thee forsake thy sins for him,
delay not the business, consultation and delay in this case is dangerous, we
must fight against our affections, says Contra affectus non subtilitate sed
impetu pugnandum est.
Seneca, not by subtilty of argument, but by force and violence. Our Saviors
counsel is good to this purpose. Mat. 5.29.30.
If thy right eye cause thee to offend pull it out: (...), pull it out, not
pick it out, as the Eagle of the valleys does the eye of her prey by degrees,
but pull it out altogether: so if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it
off, Math. 5.29. and 30. opened.
in the original it is (...), which signifies in the emphasis of the word,
chop it off, not saw it off by degrees, but chop it off, that is on a sudden,
cut it off on a sudden, cut off thy sins that are as dear as thy right hand.
Would the soul then resolve upon a divorce of sin for Christ, and upon a
peremptory will to root out all sin, let it lend no ear to Satan, or
corruption to persuade and counsel the contrary, but on a sudden to set upon
the work, and to part with all sin, and thy work might be done with lesser
difficulty. It is with the soul in this business of parting with sin for
Christ, as it is with a boy tenderly bred, that goes to bath himself in the
River: who if he enters in at some shallow place, and wades deeper and deeper
by degrees, he ever and then shrinkes back, and is resolved to go no
further, being impatient of the coldness of the water, at the length out he
goes again, and leapes into the water, and on a sudden he wets his whole
body, and then he feels no cold. A soul in like manner resolves to leave its
sins, and to accept of Christ, it begins to leave this sin and that sin,
it finds this to be harsh to its corrupt nature to part with these beloved
darlings, upon this it begins to consult with its own deceitful and corrupt
self, whether it should go on or no; corrupt nature disswads, upon this the
soul returns to its old sins again: the best way for the soul suddenly to
part with all sin, even with the whole body of sin, resolving steadfastly
through the power of an Almighty God, never to commit the least sin wittingly
or willingly any more, and the soul being winded up to this firm resolution
and keeping it self so by the power of Gods spirit assisting, the divorce of
sin will not be so grievous, the victory less difficult, for when the soul
once has parted with all sin to accept of Christ; it shall find that
sweetness in one hour by Christ's presence, that a world of earthly and
carnal delights cannot afford in many years. Oh then let not the secret
delight in any base and sordid lust keep thee, O soul, from the right
enjoying of thy sweetest Savior; part with all thy sins in exchange for this
precious pearl, and I will assure thee this, that although the parting with
thy sins may seem grievous to thee for the present; as the death of Absalon
was to David, yet as he lost but a rebellious son, so do thou lose but a
treacherous enemy to thy eternal good: Genesis 21.12.
therefore as God said to Abraham concerning the parting with Hagar and her
son; Let not the thing be grievous unto thee: no more let this parting with
thy sins trouble thee, for thou shall instead of carnal base and sensual
delight in the enjoying of sin, have an inconceiveable delight in the
enjoying of Jesus Christ, the husband of thy soul, a sippe of which pleasure
to be found in Christ will assuage the desire of the best of carnal delights.
For as Christ says concerning the new wine and the old, Luke 5.23,
the contrary may be said of this new condition of being Married to Christ, and
the old of being in the state of nature. No man having tasted the Old wine,
says Christ, cares for the New, for the old is better than the New: so no true
Christian that has got into this new condition, desires the old again; none
that has tasted this new wine of pleasure and joy to be found in Christ,
desires to drink of the old wine of fleshly and wordly delights again: hear
the opinion of Illud revera solum est gaudium quod de creatore concipitur, cui
comparata omnis aliundejucunditas maetor est, omne dulce amarum est.
Bernard, that is only true joy that is conceived of God, to which all other
mirth being compared is but sorrow, all other sweetness, grief and
bitterness. Ask holy Pota me domine torente voluptatis caelestis, ut nil jam
mundanorum libeat degustare venenatae dulcedinit. Aug.
Augustine and he is of the same opinion, for thus he prays unto God, Lord
give me to drink of the brook of heavenly pleasure, that I may never taste
any more of the poysonsome sweetness of worldly things: Ask David he is of
the same mind, One day in thy Courts is better than a thousand. Last of all,
let Christ himself be witness, who affirms that it was his meat and drink
to do the Will of his Father in heaven, showing thereby that what pleasure and
delight it is to be hungry and thirsty, to be refreshed with wholesome food,
the same delight it was to him, and is to all his members, to walk in the
ways of God, and in obedience to his Commandments enjoying thereby the peace
of Conscience in assurance of Gods love which is a continual feast, and now, O
resolute soul for Christ, art thou content to accept of Christ for thy husband
upon his own terms, to be the sole Commander of thy heart, art thou content
to be subject to him in all his Commands, be they in doing, or in suffering; I
will be thy Prophet: Christ Jesus will meet thee and embrace thee for his
Spouse, he will cloth and adorn thee with the needleworke of diverse colors,
even with the variety of graces, and when the Lord Jesus, the endeared
Bridegroom of thy soul, shall come at the Last Day, he will account of thee
as a wise Virgin having the Oil of Grace in thy Lamp, and thou shall enter
into the Bridegroomes Chamber, there to rest in his Arms and bosom unto all
Eternity.

FINIS.
