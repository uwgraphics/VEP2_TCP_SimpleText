QUho that Antique Stories reidis,
Considder may the famous deidis,
Of our Nobill Progenitouris:
Quhilk should to us be richt mirrouris.
Their verteous deidis to ensew:
And vicious leuing to eschew.
Sic Meu been put in memory
That deith should not confound their glory.
Howbeit their body been absent,
Their verieous deidis been present.
Pottis their honor to auance,
Hes put them in rememberance.
Sum wrpt of preclait Conqueroutis,
And sum of vaileand Empriouris:
And sum of Nobill Michtie Kingis,
That Royally did reull their Kingis.
And sum of Campiounis, and of kuichtis
That bauldlie did defend their richtis.
Quhilk have and he did stand in stour,
For the defense of their honor.
And sum of Squretis douch^le deidis,
That wounders wrocht in weitlie weidis.
Snm wryt of deidis amorous.
As Chauceir wrait of Croilus:
How that he luiffit Cression,
Of Ias^n and of Medea:
With help of Cleo I intend,
Sa Minerue wald me Sapienc^ send:
Ane Nobill Squyet to discryf^,
Quhais douchtines during his Life,
I know my self, thairof I write,
And all his deidis I dar indyte:
And secreitis that I did not know,
That Nobill Squire did me schaw.
Sa I intend the best I can,
Descryue the deidis and the Man:
Quhais outh did occupy in lufe,
Full plesantlie without reprufe.
Quhilk did as money douchtie deldis,
As money ane, that men of reidis,
Quhilkis Poetis puttis in Memory,
For the ^xalting of their glory:
Quhair^oir I think sa God me saif,
He should have place amangis the laif.
That his hie honor should not smure,
Considering quhat he did endure.
Often times for his Ladeis sake:
I wait Sir Lancelote du lake,
Quhen he did lufe King Arthuris wife.
Faucht never better with sword nor kny^
For his Lady in no ba^tell,
Nor had not half so just querrell.
The verity quha list declair,
His Lufe was ane Adulterai^.
And durst not cum into her sicht,
Bot like ane Houlet on the nicht:
With this Squire it stude not so,
His Lady lui^it him and no mo:
Husband, nor Lemman had scho none,
And so he had her lufe alone.
I think it is no happy life,
Ane Man to jaip his Maisteris wife:
As did Lancelote, this I conclude,
Of sic amor culd cum na good.
Now to my purpois will I pas,
And shaw ow how the Squire was:
Ane gentilman of Scotland borne,
So was his Father him beforne:
Of Nobilnes lineallie discendit,
Quhilks their good fame hes ever defendit
Good Williame Meldrum he was namit
Quhilk in his honor was never defamit:
Stalwart and stout in every strife,
And borne within the Schyre of Fyfe.
To C^eische and Bynnis richt Heritour,
Quhilk stude for Lufe in money stour.
He was bot twenty eiris of age,
Quhen he began his Uassalage:
Proportionat weill of mid stature.
Fe^rie and wicht and micht endure.
Ouirset with travel both nicht and day,
Richt hardy both in ernist and play:
Blyith in countenance, richt fair of face,
And stude weill ay in his Ladies grace:
For he was wounder amiabill,
And in all deidis honorabill.
And ay his honor did auance,
In Ingland first, and syne in France.
And their his manheid did assaill,
Under the Kingis greit Admiral.
Quhen the greit Navy of Scotland,
Pa^it to the sey aganis Ingland.
And as they passit be Ireland ^oist,
The Admiral gart land his Oist:
And set Craigfergus into Fire,
And saifit nouther Barn nor Byre:
It was greit piety for to heir,
Of the pepill the bailfull cheir
And how the Land folk were spuileit,
Fair w^men under fute were fuileit:
Bot this oung Squire bauld and wi^h:
Sauit all women quhair he mi^ht:
All Priest is and Freiris he did save,
Till at the last he did persaue:
Behind ane Garding amiabill,
Ane womanis voce richt lamentabill*
And on that voce he followit fast,
Till he did see her at the last:
Spuileit, naikit as scho was borne,
Two men of weir were her beforne:
Quhilk were richt cruel men and ken^,
Part and the spuilie them between:
Ane fairer woman nor schowes,
He had not seen in onie place:
Befoir him on her kneis scho fell,
Sayand for him that heryit Hell,
Help me sweit Sir, I am ane Maid,
Chan softly to the men he said:
I pray ow give again her sark.
And tak to ow all other wark.
Her Kirtill was of Scarlot reid,
Of gold ane garland of her heid:
Decorit with Enamelyne,
Belt and Brochis of silver fine.
Of allow Taftais we her sark,
Begaryit all with browderit wark:
Rich craftelie with gold and silk.
Than said the Lady quhyte as milk,
Except my sark nothing I crave,
Let them go hence with all the laue.
Quod they to her be Sand Fillane,
Of this eget nathing agane:
Than said the Squire courteslie.
Gud^ Freindis I pray ow hartfullie:
Gife be worthy Men of Weir,
Restoir to her agane her Geir.
Or be greit God that all h^s wrocht,
That spuilie salbe full deir bocht.
Quod they to him we the defy,
And drew their swordis haistely:
And straik at him with sa g^eit Ire,
That from his Harues flew the fire.
W^h duntis sa darflie on him dang,
That he was never in sit a^e thrang:
Bor he him manfully defendit,
And with ane bolt on them he bendif,
And har the ane upon the heid,
That to the ground he fell down deid:
For to the teith he did him c^e^f,
Lat him ly their with ane mischief.
Than with the other hand for hand,
He beit him with his birneist brand:
The other was both stout and strange,
And on the Squire darflie dang.
And than the Squire wrotht greit wonder
Ay till his sword did shaik in sunder:
Than drew he forth ane sharp dagair,
And did him cleik be the Collair,
And turn in at the colle^bane,
At the first ^raik he ^e him slare:
He found ^rit fordward to the ground,
Zit was the Squire haill and scund*
For quhy he was sa weill enarmit,
He did escaip fra them vnharmit:
And quhen he saw they were both slar^
He so that Lady past agane:
Quhair scho stude nakit on the bent,
And said tak our abulement:
And scho him thankit full humillie,
And put her claithis on spedilie:
Than kissit he that Lady fair,
And tuik his leif at her but mair:
Be that the Taburne and Trumpef blew
And every man to shipburd drew.
That Lady was dolent in heart,
From time scho saw he wald depart:
That her releuit from her harms,
And hint the Squire in her arms:
And said, will e bide in this Land,
I sall ow tak to my Husband:
Thocht I be cassin now in eair,
I am (quod scho my Fathrris Air,
The quhilk may spend of pennies round,
Of eirlie Kent ane thousand Pound:
With that hartlie sch^ did him kis,
Ar e (quod scho) content of this?
Of that (quod he (I wald be fane,
Gif I micht in this Realm remane.
Bot I mon first pas into France.
Sa quhen I cum agane perchance:
And e^^er that the Piece be maid,
To marie ow, I will be glaid.
Fair weill, I may no langer tarry,
I pray God keip ow, and sweit sanct Marie:
Than gaif scho him ane Luse taking,
Ane rich Rubie set in ane Ring.
I am (quod scho at our command,
Wi^h ow to pas into Scotland:
I thank ow hartiullie (quod he)
Ze ar ^^ir oung to saill the Sea.
And sreciallie with Men of weir,
Of that (quod scho) tak e na feir:
I sall me cleith in mennis clais,
And ga with ow quhair euir e pleis:
Should I not lufe him Paramour,
That saifit my Life and my honor*
Lady I say ow in certane,
Ze sall have lufe for lufe agane.
Trewlie unto my Lyfis end.
Fairweill, to God I ow commend.
With that into his Boit he past,
And to the ship he rowit fast,
They weyit their ankeris, and maid saill,
This Navy with the Admiral,
And landit in bauld Brytane,
This Admiral was Earl of Arrane,
Quhilk was both wise and vaileand,
Of the blude Royal of Scotland:
Accompany it with money ane Knicht.
Quhilk were richt worthy men and wicht.
Amang the laif, this oung Squyar,
Was with him richt familiar:
And throw his vertrous diligence,
Of that Lord he gat sic credence:
That quhen he did his courage ken,
Gaif him cure of five hundredth men:
Quhilkis were to him obedient,
Keddie at his commandment:
It were to lang for to declair,
The douchtie deidis that he did their:
Beraus he was sa courageous,
Ladies of him was amorous.
He was ane Munecun for ane Dame,
Meik in Chalmer lyk ane lame.
Bot in the field ane Campioun,
^ainpand like ane wyld Lyoun:
Weill pra^ikit with Speit and Scheil^
And with the formest in the Field:
No Chistane was amangis them all,
In expensis mair liberal.
In euerilk play he wan the pryse,
With that he was verteous and wise,
And so because he was weill pruift,
With every man he was weill luifit.
( HARY the aucht King of Ingland,
That time at Caleis was lyand:
With his triumphant ordinance,
Makand weit on the Realm of France.
The King of France his greit army,
Lay neit hand by in Picatdie.
Quhait aither other did assaill,
Howbeit thait was na set battaill.
Bot their was daily skirmshing,
Quhair men of armis brak mouie sting
Quhen to the Squire Meldrum
^er tauld their Nouellis all and sum:
He thocht he wald besie the weiris,
And waillit forth ane hundredth Speiris:
And futemen quhilk were bauld and stout,
The may worthy of all his rout.
Quhen he come to the King of France,
He was sone put in ordinance:
Richt so was all his company,
That on him wait it continually.
Their was into the Inglis Did,
^ne Campioun that blew great boist:
He was an^ stout Man and ane strange,
Qubilk Did wald with his conduct gang,
Outthrow the greit Army of France,
His valiantnes for to auance:
And Master Calbart was his name,
Of Scottis and French quhilk spak disdan^
And on his Bonnet vsit to beir,
Of Silver fine, takinnis of weir.
And Proclamatiounis he cart make,
That he wald for his Ladies saik,
With any gentilman of France,
Co fecht with him with Speit or Lance:
Bot no French man in all that La^d,
With him durst battle hand for hand.
Than like ane Weiriour vaileand,
He enterit in the Scottis band:
And quhen the Squire M^ldrum,
Hard tell, this Campioun was cuin.
Richt haistelie he past him till,
Demanding him quhat was his will:
Forsooth I can find none (quod he)
On horse, nor fute dar fecht with me:
Than said he, it were greit schame,
Without battle e should pas hame.
Thairfoir to God I make ane vow,
The morn my self sall fecht with ow.
Outher on Horsbak or on fuie,
Zour crakkis I count them not are cute
I sall ve fund into the Field,
Armit on Horse with speir and Scheild.
Master Talbart said, my good Child,
It were may lyk that thou were wyld:
Thou at to oung and hes no micht,
To fecht with me that is so wicht.
To speik to me thou should have fei^,
For I have sic practik in weir:
That I wald not ^^feirit be,
To make debait aganis si^ three.
For I have stand in mon^e stout,
And ay defendit my honor.
Thairfoir my barn I counsel the,
Sic interprysis to let be:
Than said this Squire to the Knicht,
I grant e at both greit and wicht:
Zoung David was far les than I,
Quhen he with Golias manfully,
Withouttin outher Speir or ^cheild.
He faucht and slew him in the Field.
I traist that God salbe my Gyde,
And give me grace to stanche thy pride:
Chocht thou be greit like Gowmakinorn^
Craist weill I sall ow meit the morn:
Beside Montruill upon the grene,
Befoir ten houris I salbe seen.
And gif e wyn me in the Field,
Both horse and Geir I sall ow eild:
Sa that siclyke e do to me,
That I sall do be God (quod he)
And thairto I give the my hand,
And swa between them maid an Band:
That they should meit upon the morn,
Bot Calbart maid at him bot Scorn.
Lychtlyand him with wordis of pride,
Syne hamewart to his Oist culd ride.
And show the Brethren of his Land,
How ane oung Scot had taken on hand,
To fecht with him beside Montruill.
Bot I traist he sall prufe the fuill.
Quod they the morn that sall we ken,
The Scottis ar haldin hardy men.
Quod he I count them not ane cute,
He sall return upon his fute:
And leif with me his armor bricht,
For weill I wait he hes no micht:
On horse nor fute to fecht with me.
Quod they, the morn that sall we se.
Quhan to Monsour de Ob^^^e
Reportit was the verity,
How that the Squire had fane on hand,
To fecht with Talbart hand for hand.
His greit courage he did commend,
Sine haistelie did for him send.
And quhen he come befoir the Lord,
The verity he did record.
How for the honor of Sco^land,
That Battle he had taken on hand,
And ten it giuis me in my heart,
Get I ane horse to tak my part,
My traist is sa in Goddis grace,
To leif kim lyand in the pla^e.
Howbeit he stalwart be and stout,
My Lord of him I have no dout.
Than send the Lord out throw the Land,
And gat ane hundredth horse fra hand:
To his presence he brecht in haist,
And bad the Squire cheis him the best.
Of that the Squire was rejoisit,
And cheisit the best as he suppoisit:
And lap on him delyuerlie,
Was never horse ran mair plesantlie.
With Speir and sword at his command,
And was the best of ail the Land:
He tuik his leif and went to rest,
Syne airlie in the morn him dressed.
Wantonlie in his weirlyke weid,
All weill enarmit saif the heid:
He lap upon his Cursour wicht,
And straucht him in his stirroppis rich^,
His speir and scheild and helm was borne
With Squyeris that raid him beforne:
Ane veluot Cap on heid he bair,
Ane quais of gold to heild his hair.
This Lord of him tuik sa greit Joy,
That he him self wald him conuoy:
With him ane hundredth men of Arms,
That their should no man do him harms.
The Squire buir into his scheild,
Ane Otter in aue silver Field.
His horse was bairdit full richly,
Couerit with Satyne Cramesie.
Than fordward raid this Campioun,
With sound of Trumpet and Clarioun.
And spedilie spurtit ouir the bent,
Like Mars the God Armipotent.
Thus leif we tydand our Squyar,
And speik of Master Talbart mair:
Quhilk gat up airlie in the morrow,
And no manner of geir to borrow:
Horse, Harnes, Speir nor Scheild,
Bot was ay reddie for the Field:
And had si^ practik into weir,
Of our Squire he tuik na feir:
And said unto his companeoun,
Or he come forth of his Pau^leoun.
This nicht I saw into my dream,
Quhilk to reheits I think greit shame:
Me thocht I saw cum fra the Sea,
Ane greit Otter rydand to me:
The qubilk was blak, with ane lang faill
And cruelly did me assaill.
And ^ait me till he gart me bleid,
And drew me backwart fra my steid:
Quhat this should men^ I can not say,
Bot I was never in sic ane fray:
His fellow said, think e not schame,
For to gif credence till ane dream.
Ze know it is aganis our Faith,
Thairfoir go dres ow in our graith,
And think weill throw our hie courage,
This day e sall wyn vassalage.
Than dressed he him into his geir,
Wantounlie like ane Man of weir,
Quhilk had both hardines and fors,
And lichtlie lap upon his horse.
His horse was bairdit full brauclie
And couerit was richt courtfullie:
With browderit wark, and veluot grieve,
Sanct Georges Croce their micht be seen
On Horse, Harnes, and all his geir,
Than raid he forth withoutt in weir:
Conuoyit with his Capitane
And with money ane Inglisman:
Arrayit all with Arms bricht,
Micht no man see ane fairer sicht.
Than clariounis and trumpettis blew
And we iriouris money hither drew:
On every side come money Man,
To behald quha the Battle wan.
The field was in the Meadow grene,
Quhair every man micht weill be seen:
The Heraldis put them sa in ordour
That no man passit within the bordour:
Nor preissit to cum within the grene,
Bot Heraldis and the Campiounis kene.
The ordour and the circumstance,
^er lang to put in remembrance:
Quhen their two nobill Men of weir,
^er w^ill accownterit in their geir.
And in their handis strange burdounis,
Than Crumpotis blew and Clariounis:
And Heraldis cryit hie on hicht,
Now let them go God shaw the richte
Than spedilie they spur^it their horse,
And ran to vtherwith sic fors,
That both their speiris in sindrie flaw,
Than said they all that stude on raw:
Ane better course than they two ran:
Was not seen sen the world began.
Than both the parties were rejoisit,
The Campiounis ane quhyle repoisit:
Till they had gottin speiris new,
Than with triumph the trumpettis blew:
And they with all the force they ran,
Wounder rudely at aither ran:
And straik at other with sa greit Ire,
That ^ra their Harnes flew the Fire.
Their Speiris warsa teuch and strange,
That aither other to Eirth down dang.
Both horse and man with Speir and scheild
Than flatlingis lay into the field.
Than Master Talbart was eschamit,
Forsooth for ever I am defamit:
And said this, I had rather die,
Without that I reuengit be.
Our oung Squire sit was his hap.
Was first on f^te, and on he lap:
Upon his horse without support,
Of that the S^ottis tuke good comfort,
Quhen they saw him sa feirelie
L^up on hois Horse sa galeardlie:
The Squire lift it his Uisair,
Ane lytill space to take the Air.
They had him wine, and he it drank,
And humillie he did them thank:
Be that Talbart on Horse mountif,
And of our Squire lytill countit.
And ^ryit gif he durst undertake,
To ryn anis for his Ladies saik.
The Squire answerit hi^ on hicht,
That sall I do be Marie bricht:
I am content all day to ryn,
Till ane of us the honor wyn:
Of that Talbart was weill content,
And ane greit Speir in hand he hent.
The Squire in his hand he ^hrang,
His Speir quhilk was both greit and lang:
With ane warp heid of gtund in steill,
Of quhilk he was appleisit weill.
That plesand Field was lang and braid,
Quhair gay ordour and towme was maid:
And eu^rie man micht have good sicht,
And their was money weirlyke Knicht*
Sum man of every Natioun,
Was in that Congregatioun.
Than Trumpettis blew triumphantly,
And they two Campiounis egeirlie:
They spurrit yair horse wish speir on brei^
Pertlie to preif their ^ith they priest:
That round rinkroume was at vtt^rance
Bot Talbartis Horse with ane mischance,
He outterit, and to ryn was laith,
Quhair of Talbart was wonder wraith.
The Squire forth his rink he ran,
Commendit weill with every man.
And him discharg^t of his speir,
Honestly like ane Man of Weir.
Because that rink they ran in vane,
Than Talbart wald not ryn agane
Till he had gottin ane better steid,
Quhilk was brocht to him with good speid
Quhairon he lap, and tuik his speir,
As brym as he had been ane Beir.
And bowtit fordwart with art bend,
And ran on to the Rinkis end:
And saw his horse was at command,
Than was he blyith, I understand.
Traistand na mair to ryn in vane,
Than all the Trumpettis blew agane.
Be that with all the force they can,
They richt rudely at other ran.
Of that meiting ilk man thocht wounder,
Quhilk soundit like ane crak of thunder.
And nane of them their marrow mist,
Sir Talbartis speir in sunder brist.
Bot the Squire with his burdoun.
Sir Talbart to the eirth dang down.
That straik was with sic micht and fors,
That on the ground lay man and horse.
And throw the brydell hand him bair,
And in the breist ane span and mair.
Throw carras and throw gluifis of plait,
That Talbart micht make na debait.
The treneheour of the Squyeris speir,
Stak still into Sir Talbartis Gei^.
Than every man into that steid,
Did all believe that he was deid.
The Squire lapricht haistelie,
From his Cursour deliuerlie,
And to Sir Talbart maid support,
And humi^lie did him comfort.
Quhen Talbart saw into his Scheild,
Ane Otter in ane silver Field.
This race (said he) I may sairrew,
For Ises weill my dream was true.
Me thocht one Otte^ ^art me bleid,
And buir me backwart from my steid.
Bot heir I vow to God Souerane,
That I sall never Just agane.
And sweitlie to the Squire said,
Thou knawis the tunning that we maid
Quhilk of us two should tyne the Field,
He should both Horse and Armor eild.
Till him that wan, quhairfoir I will,
My Horse and Harnes give the till.
Than said the Squire Courteously.
Brother I thank ow hartfullie.
Of ow forsooth nathing I crave,
For I have gottin that I wald have.
With every man he was commendit,
Sa vaileandlie he him defendi^.
The Capitane of the Inglis band,
Tuke the oung Squire be the hand.
And led him to the Paileoun,
And gart him make Collatioun.
Quhe^ Talbartis wound is was bu^d vpfast
The Inglis Capitane to him past.
And prudentlie did him comfort,
Syne said, Brother I ow exhort,
To tak the Squire be the hand,
And sa he did at his command.
And said this been bot thance of Arms,
With that he braisit him in his arms.
Sayand hartlie I ow forgive,
And than the Squyertuik his ^eue.
Commendit weill with every man,
Than wichtlie on his horse he wan:
With money ane Nobill man conuoy it:
Leave we their Talbart sair annoyit.
Sum sayis of that discomfitour,
H^ hocht sic schame and dishonor:
That he departit of that Land,
And never was seen into Ingland.
Bot our Squire did still remane
After the Weir, quhill Piece was fane.
All Capitanes of the Kingis Gairdis,
Gaif to the Squire rich rewairdis:
Because he had sa weill debaitit,
With every Nobill he was weill traifit.
After the Weir he tuke license,
Syne did return with diligence:
From Pycardie to Normandy,
And their ane space remanit he.
Because the Navy of Scotland,
Was still upon the Coist lyand.
Quhen he ane quhyle had sojornit,
He to the Court of France returnit:
For to decore his vassalege,
From Bartane tuke his veyage:
With aucht scoir in his company.
Of waillit wicht men and hardy:
Enarmit weill like men of We^r,
With Hakbut. Culuering, Pik and Speir.
And passit up throw Normandy,
Till Ambiance in Pycardie:
Quhair Nobill Lowes the King of France
Was lyand with his Ordinance:
With money ane Prince and worthy man
And in the Court of France was than:
Ane meruellous Congregatioun,
Of money ane diverse Natioun,
Of Ingland money ane prudent Lord,
After the Weir makand record,
Their was than ane Ambassador,
Ane Lord ane man of greit honor:
With him was money Nobill Kni^ht,
Of Scotland to defend their richt:
Quhilk guy dit them sa honestly,
Inglismen had them at inuie.
And purposit to make them rumm^r,
Because they were of greiter number.
And sa quhaireuer they with them met*
Upon the Scottis they maid onset.
And like wyld Lyounis furious,
They laid ane seige about the house.
Them to destroy, sa they in^endit,
Our worthy Scottis them weill desendi^
The Sutheroun was ay sywe for ane,
Sa on ilk side their was men slane.
The Inglismen grew in greit Ire,
And cryit swyith set the house infyre.
Be that the Squire Meldrum.
Into the Market streit was cum:
With his folkis in good array.
And saw the town was in ane ^ray:
He did inquyre the occasio^n,
(Quod they) the Scottis at all puf dou^^
Be Inglismen into their Innis.
(Quod he) I wald gif all the Bynnis,
That I micht cum or they departit,
With that he grew sa cruel har^it,
That he was like ane wyld Lyoun,
And rudely ran out throw the town:
With all his company weill arrayif,
And with Baner full braid displayit.
And quhe^ they saw the Inglis rouf,
They set upon them with ane schout:
With reird sa rudelte ^n them rus^hie,
That fifty to the ^irth they duschit.
Their was nocht ellis bot tak and slay,
This Squire wounder did that day.
And stoutly ^oppit in the stout,
And dang on them with dintis dout.
Was never man buit better vand,
Their micht na Buckler by de his brand.
For it was we ill seuin quarter lang,
With that sa ders^ie on them dang,
That like ane worthy Campioun,
^y at ane straik he dang ane down.
Sum was evil hurt, and sum was slane
Sum sell, quhilk raise not it agane.
Nuhen that the Sutheroun saw his micht
Effray it lie they tuke the flicht.
And wist not quhair to fly for haist,
Thus throw the town be hes them chaist.
Were not French men come to the redding.
Yair had been me kill mair b^ude shedding.
Of this journey I make ane end,
Quhilk every Nobill did commend.
Quhen to the king the care was knawin,
And all the suith unto him shawin.
How this Squire sa manfully,
On Sutberoun wan the victory.
He put* un into ordinance
And sa be did remane in france,
Ane ce^^ane time for his p^esour,
Weill estemit in g^eit honor.
Quhair he did money ane Nobill deid,
With that richt wantoun in his weid.
Quhen Ladies knew his hie courage,
He was d^syrit in Marriage.
Be ane Lady of greit Rent,
Bot outh maid him sa insolent,
That he in France wald not remane.
Bot come to Scotland hame agane.
Thocht French Ladies did for him mu^ne
The Scottis were glaid of his return.
At every Lord he tuke his leave,
Bot his departing did them greiue.
For he was luifit with all wichtis,
Quhilk had him seen defend his richtis.
Scottis Capitanes did him conuoy,
Thocht his departing did them noy.
At Deip he maid him for the saill,
Quhair he furnischit ane gay vesehaill.
For his self and his Men of Weir
With Artailie, Hakout, Bow and Sreir.
And furneist her with good virtuaill,
With the best wine that he culd waill.
And quhe^^ the Schip was reddie maid,
He lay bot ane day in the raid.
Quhill he g^t wind of the Southeist,
Than they their ankeris wey^t on haist.
And syne maid Saill, and fordwart past,
Ane day at morn, till at the last.
Of ane greit saill they gat ane sicht,
And Phoebus schew his bemis bricht,
Into the morning richt airlie.
Than past the Skipper richt spedelse,
Up to the top with richt greit feir,
And saw it was ane Man of Weir.
And cryit, I see nocht ellis perdie,
Bot we mon outher fecht or fle.
The Squire was in his bed lyand,
Quhen he hatd tell this new tydand.
Be this the Inglis Artaile,
Like hailschot maid on them assailze:
And sloppit throw their sechting saillis,
And diverse dang out ouir the waillis.
The S^ottis agane with all their micht,
Of gunnis than they leit fle ane flicht:
That they micht weill see quhair they wais
Heidis and arms flew in the Air.
The Scottis Schip schowes sa law,
That money gunnis out ouir her flaw.
Quhilk far beond them lichtit down,
Bot the Inglis greit Galeoun,
Fornent them stude like ane strange castle
Yat the Scottis gunnis micht na way faill
Bot hat her ay on the richt side,
With money aue slop for all her pride,
That money ane beft were on their bakkis
Than raise the re^k with ugly crakkis.
Quhilk on the Sey maid sic ane sound,
That in the Air it did red^und.
That men micht weill wit on the land,
That shippis were on the Sey fechtan^.
Be this the Gyder straik the shippis,
And ather on other laid their clippis.
And than began the strange ba^tell,
I^k man his marrow did assaill.
Sa rudely they did rushe togidder,
That nane micht hald their ^eit for slidder.
Sum with halbert, and sum with speir,
Bot hak^uftis did the greitest deir.
Out of the top the grundin dartis,
D^d diverse peirs outthrow the harti^.
Every man did his diligence,
Upon his so to wirk vengence.
Buschand on other routtis rude,
That ouir the waillis ran the ^lud^*
The Inglis Capitane cryit hie,
Swyith eild ow doggis or e sall d^^
And do e not, I make ane vow.
That Scotland salbe quyte of ow.
Than peirtlie answerit the Squy^r,
And said, O tratous Tauernar:
I lat the wit, thou hes na micht,
This day to put us to the st^^ht.
They derflie ay at v^he^ dang,
The Squire thrist it throw the thr^ng,
And in the Inglis schip he l^p.
And hat the Capitane sic ane slap
Upon his heid till he seil down,
Welterand intill ane deidlie swoun.
And quhen the Scottis saw the Squire,
Had strikk in down that rank Reue^:
They left their a win schip stand and waist
And in the Inglis schip in haist:
They follow it all their Capitane,
And sone was all the Sutheroun slane.
Howbeit they were of gre^ter number,
The Scottismen put them in sic cumme^^
That they warfane to leif the Field,
Cryand mercy, than did them e^ld.
Zit was the Squire strai^and fast,
At the Capitane till at the last:
Quhen be persauit no remeid,
Outher to eild, or to be deid:
He said, O gen^^ll Capitane,
Thoill me not for to be slane.
My life to ow salbe mair pryse.
Nor sall my deith ane thousand sy^^.
For e may get as I suppois,
Chri^ thousand Nobillis of the Koi^*
Of me, and of my company,
Thairfoir I cry ow loud mercy.
Except my life nothing I cr^if,
Tak ow the schip and all the lai^
I ostd to ow haith sword and knyfe,
Thairfoir guds Master save my Life.
The Squire tuik him be the hand,
And on his feit he gart him stand:
And tr^ittit him richt tenderly,
And syne unto his men did cry.
And gaif to them richt strait command,
To straik no moir, bot ^ald their hand.
Than both the Capitanes tan and red,
And so their was ^^ mair blude shed.
Than all the laif they did them; eild,
And to the Scottis gaif sword and shield*
Ane ^o^ill Leiche the Squire had,
Qubairof the Inglismen ^es full glaid.
To quhome the Squire gaif command
The woundit men to tak ou hand.
And so he did with diligence,
Quhairof he gat good recompense.
Than quhen the woundit men were dressed,
And all the ^eand men confessed.
And deid men cassin in the Sea,
Quhilk to behald was greit piety.
Their was slane of Inglis band,
Five scoi^ of men I understand.
The quhilk were cruel men and ken^,
And of the Scottis were slane fyftens.
And quhen the Inglis Capitane
Saw, how his men were taken and slane:
And how the Scottis safew in number,
Had put them in sa greit ane cummer.
He grew intill ane frenesy,
Sayand, falls Fortoun I the defy.
For I beleuit this day at morn,
That he was not in Scotland borne*
That durst have met me hand for hand:
Within the boundis of my brand.
The Squire bad him make good their,
And said, it was bot chance of Weir.
Greit Conquerouris I ow assure.
Hes hapnit siclike adventure.
Thairfort make mirrie and go dyne,
And let us preif the michtie wine.
Sum drank wine, and sum drank Kill,
Syne put the Wippis under saill.
And waillit forth of the Inglis band,
Two hundredth men, and put on land.
Quyetlie on the Coist of Kent,
The laif in Scotland with him went.
The Inglis Capitane as I ges,
He wairdit him in the Blaknes,
And triitit him richt honestly,
Togithee with his company.
And held them in that Garnisou^,
Till they had pay it their Kansoun.
Out throw the land than sprang the fame
That Squire Meidium was cum ham^
Quhen they hard tell how he d^bai^if,
With every man le was sa treitit:
That quhen he trauellit throw the land,
They bankettit him fra hand to hand.
With greit solace, till at the last,
Out throw Straithe^ne the Squrer pas^
And as it did approach the nicht,
Of a^e Castle he gat ane sicht,
B^si^e ane Montane in ane vaill,
And than after his greit trauaill,
He purpoisit him to repois,
Quhair ^ls man did of him rejois.
Of this triumphant plesand place,
Ane lusty Lady was Maistres.
Quhais Lord was deid schort time beso^e
Quhairthrow her dolor was the moir.
Bot it scho tuke sum comforting,
To heir the pleasant dulce talking,
Or^ this oung Squire of his chance,
And how it forton^t him in France.
This Squire and the Lady gent,
Did mesche, and then to supper went.
During that nicht their was nocht ellis,
Bot ^or to heir of his Nouellis.
Eneas quhen he ^^ed from Troy,
Did not Queen Dido greiter Joy:
Quhen he in Carthage did arryue,
And did the seige of Croy discryu^.
The wonderis that he did reheirs,
Were langsum for to put in ve^s.
Of quhilk this Lady did rejois.
They drank, and syne went to ^epois.
He fand his Chalmer weill arrayit,
With dor^ik work on buird dispiayit.
Of Uenisoun he had his waill,
Good Aquabite, Wine and Aill.
With nobill Confeittis, Bran and Geill,
And swa the Squire fuir richt weill.
Sa to heir mair of his narratioun,
This Lady come to his Collatioun.
^ayand he was ti^ht welcum hame,
Grandmercie than (quod he) Madame,
They past the time with Ches and Tahiff,
For he to every game was abill.
Than unto bed drew every witht,
To Chalmer went this Lady bricht.
The quhilk this Squire did conuoy,
Syne till his bed Le went with Joy:
That nicht he sleipit never ane wink.
Bot still did on the Lady think:
Cupido with his fyrie dart,
Did peirs him so out throw the heart,
Sa all that nicht he did bot inurnit:
Sum time sat up, and sumtyme turnit:
Sichand with money gant and grave.
To fair Venus makand his mane:
Sayand, Lady, quhat may this mean?
I was ane fre man lait istrene:
And now ane catiue bound and thrall,
For ane that I think Flour of all.
I pray God, sen scho knew my mind,
How for hirsaik I am sapynd.
Mald God I had been it in France,
Or I had hapnit sic mischance:
To be subject or seruiture:
Till ane, quhilk takis of me na cure.
This Lady ludgit neirhand by,
And hard the Squire privily:
With dre^dfull heart makand his moan,
With money cairfull gant and groan:
Her heart fulfillit with piety,
Thocht scho wald haif of him mercy:
And said howbeit I should be slane,
He sall have lufe for lufe agane.
Ma^d God I micht with my honor,
Have him to be my Paramour.
This was the mirrie time of May,
Quhen this fair Lady fresh and gay,
Start up to take the hailsum Air,
With pantonis on hirfeit an^ pair:
Airlie into ane cleir morning.
Befoir fair Phoebus vprysing:
Kirtill alone withouttin Clok,
And saw the Squyeris ^ure vulok^
Stho slippie in or ever he wist,
And feneitlie past till ane kissed.
And with her key is oppinnit the Lokkis
And maid her to take forth ane Box.
Bot that was not her erand their:
With that this lusty oung Squyar,
Saw this Lady so plesantlie,
Cum to his Chalmer quyetlie.
In Kyrtill of fine Damais broun,
Her goldin traissis hingand down:
^ir Pappis were hard, round and quhyte,
Quhome to behald was greit delight.
Like the quhyte lyllie was her lyre,
Her hair was like the reid gold wyre.
Her schankis quhyte withouttin hois,
Quhairat the Squire did rejois.
And said than now veil quod veil,
Upon the Lady thou make ane sail.
Her Courlyke Kirtill was vnlaist,
And sone into his armis her braist*
And said to her Madame gude-morne,
Help me our man, that is forlorn.
Without e make me sum remeid.
Withouttin dout, I am bot deid.
Quhairfoir e mon releif my harms,
With that he hint her in his arms
And talkit with her on the flure,
Syne quyetlie did bar the dure.
Squire (quod scho) quhat is our will*
Think e my womanh^^d to spill?
Na God forbid, it were greit syn,
My Lord and e was neir of Kyn.
Quhairfoir I wak ow supplicatioun,
Pas and seik ane dispensatioun.
Chansall I wed ow with ane King,
Than may e leif at our lyking:
For e ar oung, lusty and fair.
And als e ar our Fatheris Air.
Their is na Lady in all this land,
May ow refuse to her Husband,
Ane gif e lufe me as e say,
Haist to dispens the best e may.
And their to ow I give my hand,
I fall ow take to my Husband.
(Quod he) quhill that I may endure,
I vow to be our seruiture.
Bot I think greit veratioun*
To tarry upon dispensatioun.
Than in his armis he did her thrist,
And aither other sweitlie kis^*
And wame for wame they other braissle,
With that her ^^irtill was vnlaissit:
Than Cupido with his fyrie dartis.
Inflammit sa their Luiferis hartis
They micht na manner of way disseuer.
Nor ane mic^t not part s^a ane other.
Bot like wodbind they were both wrappif*
Their tenderly he hes her happit.
Full softly up intill his Bed,
Judge e gif he her schankis ^^ed.
Allace (quod scho) quhat may this mean*
And with her hairscho dicht her En^.
I can not tell how they did play,
Bot I believe scho said not nay.
He ple^sit her sa, as I hard sane,
That he was welcum ay agane.
Sctio raise and tendirlie him kissed.
And on his hand ane King scho thrist.
And he gaif her ane lufe dro^ rye,
Ane King set with ane rich Rubie,
In takin that their Lufe for ever,
Suid never from their two disseuer.
And than scho passit unto her Chalmer,
And fand her madinnis sweit as Lamm^t.
Sleipand full sound and nothing wist,
How that their Lady past to the Kissed:
(Quod they) Madame quhair have e ben^
(Quod scho) into my Gardine grene.
To heir their mirrie birdis sang,
I lat ow wit, I thocht not lang,
Thocht I had taryit their quhill None.
(Quod ya^) quhair was our hois and schone?
Quhy eid e with our belly bair?
(Quod scho) the morning was sa fair.
For be him that deir Jesus sauld,
I felt na wayis any manner of cauld.
(Quod they) Madame me think e sweit:
(Quod scho) e see I sufferit heit:
The dew did sa on flouris fleit,
That both my Lymmis ar maid weit:
Thairfoir ane quhyle I will heirly,
Till this dulce dew be ^ra me dry.
Rise and gar make our denner reddie,
That salbe done (quod they) my Lady.
After that scho had taken her rest,
Sho raise, and in her Chalmer her dressed:
And after Mes to denner went,
Than was the Squire diligent:
To declair money sindrie story.
Worthy to put in Memory.
Quhat sall we of their Luiferis say?
Bot all this time of lusty May:
They past the time with Joy and blis,
Full quyetlie with money ane kis:
Their was na Creature that knew.
Zit of thi^ Luiferis Chalmer glue:
And sa he leuit plesandlie,
Ane certane time with his Lady.
Sum time with halking and hunting*
Sum time with wantoun horse rinning.
And sum time like ane man of weir,
Full galardlie wald tyn ane speir.
He wan the pryse abone them all,
Both at the Buttis and the Futeball.
Till every solace he was abill,
At cartis and dyce, at Ches and fabill
And gif e list I sall ow tell,
How that he seigit ane Castle.
Ane Messinger come spedilie,
From the Lennox to that Lady.
And schew how that Maksagon,
And with him money bauld Baron.
Her Castle had taken perfors,
And nouther left her kow nor horse.
And heryir all that land about,
Quhairof the Lady had greit dout.
Till her Squire scho passit in haist,
And schew him how scho was oppressed.
And how he waistit money ane mile,
Betuix Dunbartane and Argyle.
And quhen the Squire Meldrum,
Had hard their Nouellis all and sum;
Intill his heart their grew sic Ire,
That all his body bri^t in fire.
And swoir it should be full deir sald,
Gif he micht find him in that hald*
He and his men did them addres,
Richt haistelie in their Harnes.
Sum with bow, and sum with speir*
And he like Mars the God of weir*
Come to the Lady and tuke his less,
And scho gaif him her richt hand gluis:
The quhilk he on his basnet bure,
And said Madame I ow assure:
That worthy Lance^ot du laik,
Did never mair for his Ladies saik:
Nor I sall do, or ellis de,
Without that e reuengit be.
Than in her arms scho him braist,
And he his leif did take in haist:
And raid that day and all the nicht,
Till on the morn he gat anesicht
Of that Casteil both fair and strange,
Than in the middis his men amang:
To michtie Mars his vow he maid,
That he should never in heart be glaid:
Nor it return forth of that land,
Quhill that strenth were at his command.
All the Tennentis of that Lady,
Come to the Squire haistelie.
And maid aith of fidelity,
That they should never fra him fly.
Qu^en to Makferland wicht and bauld,
The v^ritie all haill was tauld.
How the oung Squire Meldrum,
Was now into the Cuntrie ^um:
Purpoisand to seige that place,
Than vittaillit he that Fortres.
And swoir he suid that place defend*
Bauldlie until his lyfisend.
Be this the Squire was arrayit,
With his Bauer bricht displayit.
With euluering hakbut, bow, and spei^
Of Makfarland he tuke na ^cir.
And like an^ Campioun courageous,
He cryit and said gif ouir the house:
The Capitane answerit heichly,
And said, tratour we the defy.
We sall remane this house within,
Into despyte of all thy kyn.
With that the Archeris bauld and wicht;
Of braid arrow is let fle ane flicht.
Amang the Squyeris company,
And they agane richt manfully:
With Hakbute, Bow, and Culueryne,
Qu^ilk put Makferlandis men to pyne.
And on their colleris laid full sikker,
And their began ane bailfull bikker.
Their was bot schot and schot agane;
Till on ilk side their was men slane.
Than cryit the Squire courageous,
Swyith lay the ledderis to the house.
And sa they did, and clam belyse.
As busy Beis dois to their hyse.
Howbeit their was slane money man,
it wichtlie ouir the wallis they wa^
The Squyertormest of them all,
Plantit the Baner ouir the wall:
And than began the mortal fray,
Their was not ellis bot tak and slay.
Than Makferland that maid the prais,
From time he saw the Squyeris face:
Upon his kneis he did him eild,
Deliver and him both speir and scheild.
The Squire hartlie him ressauit,
Commandand that he should be sauit:
And sa did slaik that mortal feid,
Sa that na man was put to deid.
In fre waitd was Makferland seisit,
And leit the laif gang qu hair they pleisif.
And sa this Squire amorous,
Seigit, and wan the Ladies house.
And left thairin ane Capitane,
Syne to Stratherne returnit agane:
Quhair that he with his fair Lady,
Ressauit was full plesantlie.
And to tak rest did him conuoy,
Judge e gif their was mirth and Joy.
Howbeit the Chalmer dure was cloisit,
They did bot kis, as I suppoisit.
Gifvt^er thing was them between,
Let them discover that Luiferis be^e.
For I am not in Lufe expart,
And never studyit in that art.
Thus they remainit in merines,
Beleifand never to have distres.
In that meine time this Lady fair,
Ane douchter to the Squire bair:
Nane fund was fairer of visage,
Than tuke the Squire sic courage:
Agane the mirrie time of May,
Threttie he put in his Luferay.
In Scarlot fine, and of hew grene,
Quhilk was ane semelie sicht to seen.
The gentilmen in all that land,
Were glaid with him to make ane band:
And he wald plainly tak their partis,
And not desyring bot their hartis.
Thus leu't the Squire plesandlie,
With Music and with Menstralie.
Of this Lady he was sa glaid,
Their micht na sorrow make him sad,
I^k ane did other consolatioun,
Taryand upon dispensatioun.
Hadit cum hame, he had her bruikit,
Bot or it come, it was miscuikit:
And all this game he bocht full deit,
As e at lenth sall ef^er heir.
Of warldlie Joy it was weill kend,
That sorrow be^e the fatal end:
For Jealousy and falz Inuie,
Did him per^^w richt cruelly.
I meruell not thocht it be so,
For they were ever Luiseris fo.
Quhait^hrow he stude in money ane stour.
And ay defen^it his honor.
Ane cruel Knicht dw^lt neir hand by,
Quhilk at this Squire had Inuy:
Imaginand in^ill his heart,
How he their Luiferis micht depart:
And wa^d have had her maryand,
Ane gentilman within his land.
The quhilk to him was not in blude,
Bot fi^allir for to conclude,
Thairto scho wald never assent,
Quhairfoir the Knicht set his Intent*
This nobill Squire for to destroy,
And swore, ^e su^d never have Joy:
In till his ha^t without remeid,
Till a^e of them were left for de^d.
This vaileand Squire mansully,
In ernist or play did him defy.
Offeran^ him self for to essaill,
Body for body in battaill.
The Ku^cht thairto not condiscendi^,
Bot to betrais him ay intendit.
Sa it fell anis upon ane day,
In Edinburgh as I hard say:
This Squire and the Lady frew,
Was their just matter^s to persew:
That cruel Knicht full of Inuy,
Gart hald on them ane secreit Spy:
Quhen thaj should pas forth of the town,
For this Squyeris confusioun:
Quhilk traistit no man should him greiue,
Nor of tressoun had no believe.
And tuik his license from his Oist,
And liberally did pay his Coist.
And sa departit blyith and mirrie,
With purpois to pas ouir the Ferrie.
He was bot aucht sum in his rout,
For of danger he had no dout.
The Spy come to the Knicht ano^e,
And him informit how they were gone.
Than gadderit he his men in hy,
With thrie scoir in his company.
Accowterit weill in feir of weir,
Sum with bow, and sum with speir.
And on the Squire followit fast,
Till they did see him at the last:
With all his men richt weill arrayit,
With cruel men nathing effrayit.
And quhen the Lady saw the rout,
God wait gif scho stude in greit dout.
(Quod scho our enemeis I see,
Thairfoir sweit heart I reid ow fl^.
In the country I will be kend,
Ze ar na party to defend.
Ze know one Knichtis cruelty,
That in his heart hes uo mercy.
It is bot ane that they wald have,
Thairfoir deir heart ourself e save.
Howbeit they tak me with this trane,
I salbe sone at ow agane.
For e war never sa hard staid,
Madame (quod he) be e not raid:
For be the halie Trinity,
This day ane fute I will not fle.
And be he had endit this word.
He drew ane lang two handit sword:
And put his aucht men in array,
And bad that they should tak na fray.
Than to the Squire cryit the Knicht,
And said, send me the Lady bricht:
Do e not sa, be Goddis Corce,
I sall her tak away perforce.
The Squire said, be thou ane Knicht,
Cum forth to me and shaw the richt.
Bot hand for hand without redding,
That their be na mair blude shedding.
And gif thou winnis me in the field,
I sall my Lady to the eild.
The Knicht durst not for all his land*
Fecht with this Squire hand for hand.
The Squire than saw no remeid,
Bot outher to fecht, or to be deid.
To heuin he liftit up his visage,
Cry and to God with hie courage:
To the my querrell I do commend,
Syne bowtit fordwart with ane bend:
With countenance both bauld and stout,
He rudely rushit in that rout.
With him his litill company,
Quhilk them defendit manfully.
The Squire with his birneist brand,
Amang his famen maid sic hand:
That Gaudefer, as say is the Letter,
At Gadderis Ferrie faucht no better.
His sword he swappit sa about,
That he greit roum maid in the rout:
And like ane man that was dispairit,
His wapoun sa on them he wairit:
Quhome ever he hit as I hard say,
They did him na mair deir that day*
Quha ever come within his boundis,
He chaipit not but mortal woundis.
Sum mutilate were, and sum were slane,
Sum fled, and come not it agane.
He hat the Knicht abone the brris,
That he fell fordwart on his kneis.
Were not Thome Giffard did him save,
The Knicht had sone been in his grave.
Bot than the Squire with his brand,
Hat Thomas Giffard on the hard:
From that time forth during his life,
He never weildit sword nor knyfe.
Than come ane sort as brim as beiris,
And in him fest^it fyfre^e speiris:
In purpois to have borne him down,
Bot he as forcie Campioun:
Ama^g thai wicht men wrocht greit won^der
For all thai speiris he schure in sunder.
Nane durst cum neir him hand for hand,
Within the boundis of his ^rand.
This worthy Squy^r courageous,
Micht be compa^^^^ to Tydeus:
Quh^lk fa^cht for to defend his Richtis,
And slew of Thebes fyf^ie Knichtis.
R^^land with Brand well his bricht brand,
Faucht ^e^er be^ter hand for hand,
Nor Gaw^^ aganis Gelibras,
Nor Ol^u^r with Pharambras.
I wait he faucht that day als weill,
As did Sir Gry^ne a ^anis Graysteill:
And I ^^r say, he was als abi^^,
As on^e Knicht of the round Tabill:
And did his honor mair auance,
Nor onie of they Knichtis perchance:
The quhi^k I offer me to preif
Gif that e pleis Sirs with ourleif.
Amang they Knichts was maid ane band,
That they should fecht bot hand for hand:
Assurit that their should cum no mo,
With this Squire it stude not so.
His stalwart stout quha wald discryfe,
Aganis ane man ^hair come ay fyfe.
Quhen that this cruel tyrane Knicht.
Saw the Squire sa wounder wicht.
And had no micht him to destroy,
Into his heart their grew sic noy:
That he was abill for to rage,
That no man micht his Ire assuage:
Fie on us said he to his men,
Ay aganis ane sen we arten.
Chaip he away, we are eschamif,
Like cowartis we salbe defamit:
I had rather be in hellis pane,
Or he should chaip fra us vnslane.
And ca^lit thrie of his company,
Said pas ^ehind him quye^^^e:
And sa they did r^ch^ secreitlie,
And come behind him cowartlie
And hackit on his horhis and ^heis,
Till that he fell upon his kneis:
Zit quhen his se^ankis wet schorne in sunder,
Upon his kneis be wrocht greit wounder.
Sweipa^d his sword round about,
Not haifand of the deith na dout:
Durst nane approach within his boundis,
Till that his cruel mortal woundis,
Bled sa, that he did swap in swoun,
Perforce behuitit him than fall down.
And quhen he lay upon the ground,
They gaif him money cruel wound:
That men on far micht heir the knokkis,
Like boucheouris hakkand on their stokks
And finally without remeid,
They left him lyand their for deid.
With ma woundis of sword and knyfe,
Nor ever had man that keipit life.
Quhat should I of their tratouris say*
Quhen they had done they fled away.
Bot than this lusty lady fair,
With dolent heart scho maid sic cair:
Quhilk was greit piety for to reheirs
And langsum for to put in verse.
With teiris scho wuische his bludie face,
Sichand with many loud all ace.
Allace quod scho that I was borne,
In my querrell thou art forlorn.
Sall never man after this hour,
Of my body have mair plesour.
For thou was gem of gentilnes,
And werie well of worthiness.
Than to the eirth scho rushit down,
And lay intill ane deidlie swoun.
Be that the Regent of the land,
Fra Edinburgh come fast rydand.
Sir Anthony Darsie was his name,
Ane Knicht of France and man of fame.
Quhilk had the guiding haillilie,
Under Johne Duke of Albanie.
Quhilk was to our oung King Cutour,
And of all Scotland Governor.
Our King was bot five eiris of age.
That time quhen done was the outrage.
Quhen this good Knicht the Squire saw,
Thus lyand in till his deid thraw.
Woe is me (quod he to see this, sicht,
On the, quihi^k worthy was and wicht.
Wald God that I had been with the,
As thou in France was a^is with me.
Into the land of Picardy,
Quhair Inglis men had greit Inuy:
To have me slane, sa they fatendit,
Bot manfully thou me defendit:
And vaileandlie did save my life,
Was never man with sword nor knyfe,
Nocht Hercules, I dar weill say,
That ever faucht better for ane day.
Defendand me within ane stound,
Thew dang seir Sutheroun to the ground
I may the make no help allace,
Bot I sall follow on the cha^e.
Richt spedilie both day and nicht,
Till I may get that cruel Knicht.
I make ane vow gif I may get him,
In till ane Presoun I sall set him.
And quhen I heir that thou beis dei^,
Than sall my handis straik of his heid.
With that he gave his horse the spurris,
And speedily flaw ouir the furris.
He and his Gaird with all their micht,
They ran till thaj ouirtuik the Knicht.
Quhen he approchit he lichtit down,
And like ane veil and Campioun:
He tuik the Tyrane presonar,
And send him backward to Dumbar.
And their remainit in presoun,
Ane certane time in that Dungeoun*
Let him ly their with me kill case,
And speik we of our heynd Squyar:
Of quhome we can not speik bot good,
Quhen he lay bath and in his blude.
His freindis and his Lady fair,
They maid for him sic dule and cair:
Quhilk were greir piette to deploir,
Of that matter I speik no moir.
They sead for Leithes haistelie,
Spne buir his body tenderly:
To ludge into ane fair ludgyne,
Quhair be ressauit medteyne.
The gre^test Leichis of the land,
Come all to him without command.
And all practihis on him prouit,
Because he was sa weill belouit.
They tuik on hand his life to save,
And he them gaif quhat they wald have?
Bot he sa lang lay into pane,
He turait to be a^e Chirurgiane:
And als be his natural ingyne,
He lernit the Art of Medicyne.
He saw them on his body wrochf,
Quhairfoir the Science was deir bocht.
Bot efterward quhen he was haill,
He spairit na coist nor it trauaill.
To preif his practikis on the pure,
And on them preuit money ane sure:
On his expensis without rewaird,
Of Money he t^i^ na regaird.
Zit sam thing will we commoun mair
Of this Lady qubilk maid greit cair.
Quhilk to the Squire was mair pane,
Nor all his woundis in ^crta^e.
And than her freindis did conclude,
Because scho micht ^o him ^a good.
That seho should take her leif and go.
Till her cuntrie, and scho did so:
Bot their luiferis met never agane,
Quhilk was to them ane lestand pane.
For scho aganis her will was maryir,
Quhairthrow her weird scho daily waryit
Howbeit her body was absent,
Her tender heart was ay present:
Both nicht and day with her Squyar,
Was never Creature that maid sic cair.
Penelope for Ulisses,
I wait, had never mair distres.
Nor Cresseid for true Troylus,
Was not tent part sa dolorous.
I wait is was aganis her heart,
That scho did from hit Lufe depart.
Helene had not sa mekill noy,
Quhen scho perforce was bro^ht to Troy.
I leif her than with heart fullsore,
And speik now of this Squire more.
Quhen this Squire was haill and sound,
And softly micht gang on the ground:
To the Regent he did complane,
Bot he allace was richt soue slane.
Be David Hume of Wedderburne,
The quhilk gart money Frenchemen mur^^
For their was nane mair nobill Knicht,
Mair veil and, mair wise, mair wi^ht,
And sone after that cruelty,
The Knicht was put to liberty:
The quhilk the Squire had oppressed,
Sawes his matter left undressed.
Because the King was oung of age,
Than tyrannis rang into thai^ rag^*
Bot efterward, as I hard say,
On Striuiling brig upon ane day:
This knicht was slane with cruelty,
And that day gat na mair mercy.
Nor he gaif to the oung Squyar,
I say na mair, let him ly their,
For cruel men e may weill see,
They end ofttimes with cruelty.
For Christ to Peter said this word,
Quha ever straikis with ane sword:
That man salbe with ane sword slane,
That saw is suith, I tell ow plane.
He menis quha straikis cruelly,
Aganis the Law without mercy:
Bot this Squire to nane offendit,
Bot manfully him self defendit.
Was never man with sword nor knyfe,
Micht saif their honor and their life.
As did the Squire all his dayis,
With money terribill affrayis.
Wald I at lenth his life declair,
I micht weill writ ane other quair.
Bot at this time I may not mend it,
Bot shaw ow how the Squire endit.
Their dwelt in Fyfe ane agit Lord.
That of this Squire hard record.
And did desire richt hartfullie,
To have him in his company,
And send for him with diligence,
And he come with obedience.
And lang time did with him remane,
Of quhome this agit Lord was fane.
Wise men desiris commounlie
Wise men into their company.
For he had been in money ane Land.
In Flanderis France and in Ingland:
Quhairfoir the Lord gaif him the cure,
Of his houshald I ow assure.
And in his Hall theif Merschall.
And auditour of his comptis all.
He was ane richt Courticiane,
And in the Law ane Practicia^e
Quhairfoir during this Lordis life,
Tchyref^e pute he was in Fyfe.
To eueri^ man ane equal Judge,
And of the pure he was refuge.
And with Justice did them support,
And curit their sairis with grief comfort.
For as I did reheirs before,
Of Medicine he tu^e the Lore,
Quhen he saw the Chirurgience,
Upon him do their diligence.
Experience maid him perfyte,
And of the Science tuke sic delyfe
That he did money thriftie cure,
And specially upon the pure.
Without rewaird for his expensis,
Without regaitd or recompencis.
To gold, to silver, or to rent,
This Nobill Squire tuke lifill fent.
Of all this world na mair he craifit,
Sa that his honor micht be saifit.
And ilk ^ir for his Ladies saik,
Ane Banquet Royal wald he maik.
And that he maid on the Sunday.
Precedand to Asch wednisday.
With wyld foull, vemsoun and wine.
With tairf, and flam, and srutage fine:
Of Bran and Geill their was na sk^n^,
And Ipocras he wald not want.
I have sent sittand at his Tabill,
Lordis and Lairdis honorabill.
With Knichtis and money ane gay Squya^
Quhilk were to lang for to declair.
With mirth Music and menstrallie,
All this he did for his Lady.
And for her saik during his life,
Wald never be weddit to ane wife.
And quhen he did declyne to age,
He faillit never of his courage.
Of ancient storyis for to tell,
Above all other he did ^ell.
Sa that euerilk Creatu^^,
To heir him speik they tuke pleasure.
Bot all his deidis honorabill,
For to descryue I am not abill.
Of every man he was commendit,
And as he leiuit, sa he endit.
Plesandlie till he micht endure,
Till dolent deith come to his dure.
And cruelly with his mortal dart,
^e straik the Squire throw the heart.
His saull with Joy Angelical,
Past to the ^euin Imperial.
Thus at the Struther into Fyfe,
This nobill Squire loist his life.
I pray to Christ for to conuoy,
All sic true Luiferis to his Joy.
Say e Amen for Cheritie,
Adieu, e sall get na mair of me.
FINIS.
THE Testament of the nobill and vaileand Squire Williame Meldru^ of the
Bynnis. Compylit be Sir David Lyndesay of the Mont. etc.
THe Holy man Job, ground of patience,
In his greit trubill trewlie did report,
Quhilk I persaue now be Experience,
That mennis life in ^irth been wounder short.
My outh is gane and eild now dois resort:
My time is gan^ I think it bot ane dream,
Zit after deith remane sall my good fame.
I persaue shortly, that I man pay my det,
To me in ^irth no place been permanent:
My heart on it no mair now will I set,
Bot with the help of God omnipotent,
With resolute mind go make my Testament:
And tak my leif at cuntriemen, and kyn,
And all the world and thus I will begin.
Thrie Lordis to me salbe Executouris,
Lindesayis all thrit in surname of renoun:
Of my Testament they sall have hail the cure,
To put my mind till executioun.
That Surname faileit never to the Croun,
Na m^ir will they to me I am richt sure,
Quhilk is the ^aus that I give them the cure*
First David Erll of Craufuird wise and wicht
And Iohne Lord Lindesay my master sp^
The third salbe ane nobill trauellit Knicht,
Quhilk kn^wis the coistis of Feistis funeral:
The wise Sir Walter Lindesay they him call.
Lord of S. Iohne, and Knicht of Torfishane,
Be sey and land ane veil and Capitane.
Thocht age hes maid my body impotent.
Zit in my heart hie courage does precell:
Quhairfoir I leif to God with good intent,
My spreit, the quhilk he hes maid immortal
In^^l his Court perpetually to dwell:
And neuir moir to steir forth of that steid
Till Christ descend and judge both quick and deid.
I ow beseik my Lordis Executouris,
My geir give till the nixt of my kynrent:
It is weill kend, I never tuik na cures,
Of conquessing of riches nor of Rent:
Dispone as e think may expedient:
I never tuik cure of gold more than of glass:
Without honor, fie ty upon Kiches.
I ow requeist my freindis ane and all,
And nobill men, of quhome I am descendit:
Faill not to be at my feist funeral,
Quhilk ^hrow the world I traist salbe co^mendit
Ze know how that my fame I have defendit
During my life unto this latter hour.
Quhilk s^ld to ow be infinite plesour.
First of my Bowellis clenge my body clean,
Within and out, syne wesche it weill with wine
Bot honesty see that nothing be seen,
Syne clois it in ane coistlie caruit schryne,
Of Ceder treis, or of Cyper fine:
Anoint my corpse with Balm delicious,
With Cynamome and Spycis precious.
In two caissis of gold and precious stanis,
Inclois my heart and tongue richt craftelie;
My sepulture syne gar make for my banis,
Into the Tempill of Mars triumphandlis,
Of marhill stanis caruit richt curiously:
Quhairin my Kissed and banis e sall clois
In that triumphand Tempill to repois.
Mars: Uenus and Mercurius all three,
Gave me my natural in^linatiounis:
Quhilk rang the day of my nativity,
And sa their heavenly constellatiounis,
Did me support in money Natiounis,
Mars maid me hardy like ane feirs lyou^,
Quhairthrow I conqueist honor and renoun.
Quho list to know the a^is Bellical,
Let them go reid the legend of my life:
Chair sall thai find the deidis martial
How I have stand in money stalwart stri^e:
Uictoriouslie with speir, shield, sword and knife:
Quhairfoir to Mars the God Armipotent
My corpse incloisit e do till him present.
Make offering of my soung Rhefortcall,
Till Mercurius quhilk gaif me ^loquence,
In his Tempill to hing perpetual,
I can make him na better recompense.
For quhen I was brocht to the presence,
Of Kings in Scotland, Ingland and in France*
My ornate tongue my honor did auance.
Cofresche Uenus my heart e sall present,
Quhilk hes to me been ay comfortabill:
And in my face sic grace scho did ^np^ent,
All creatures did think me amiabill,
Women to me scho maid sa fau^rabill:

Bot honestly I did obtene her grace!
My friend Sir David Lyndsay of ye Mon^

In ane Luferay oung stalwart men and stout,

For men of Arms very conuenabill,

With huidis heklit down ouirthort their ene:
