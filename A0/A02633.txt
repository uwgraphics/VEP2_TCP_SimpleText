Of whose gracious nombre a very special membre and a vessel of Gods

He that has judgment in the sprete / shall easelye perseyue by this treatise
/ what beastlye blockeheades these bloudye bellyegoddes were in their unsavory

Most surely fulfilled Christ that promise in him which he made to his
Apostles. Luc. 21. Mat. 10. Mar. 13. Luc. 12.
Cast not in your minds before hand (says he) what answer ye shall make
when these spiritual tyrauntes shall examine you in their synagoges / and so
deliver you up unto kings and debytees. For I will give you soche vtteraunce
and wisdom in that hour / as all your enemies shall never be able to resyst.
Christ's disciple.
This only sentence of Christ adjoined to his godly answer / is enough to
prove him his true disciple / and them in their folyshe questyons / the
manifest members of satan. I remember that.xiiii. years ago / the true
servant of God William Tyndale put into the prent a certain brefe examinacyon
of the said lord Cobham. The examinacyon of the lord Cobha^
The which examinacyon was written in the time of the said lords troble / by a
certain frynde of his / and so reserved in copyes unto this our age. But sens
that time I have found it in their own wrytynges (which were than his vttre
enemies) in a much more ample form than there. the great process of Thomas
Arundell.
Specyallye in the great process which Thomas Arundell the Archebysshop of
Caunterburye made than against him / written by his own notaryes and clar^^^ /
tokened also with his own sign and scale / and so dyrected unto Richard
Clyfforde than Bishop of London with a general commandment to have it than
publyshed by him and by the other Bysshoppes the whole realm over.

Thomas Walden. in fasciculo zizanio ^um Vvicleni.
Forthermore I have seane it in a copye of that writing / which the said
Richard Clyfforde sent unto Robert Mascall a Carmelyte fryre and Bishop of
Herforde under his sign and seal / and in a copye of his also dyrected to the
Archedeacons of Herforde and Shrewesburye. The year / month / and day of
their date with the beginnings of their wrytynges shall here after follow in
the book / as occasyon shall require it. Fro^whe^s this treatise comes.
Besides all this Thomas Walden being in those days the kings confessor /
and present at his examinacyon / condempnacyon / and execracyon / regestred it
among other processes more / in his book called Fasciculus zizaniorum
Vvicleui. He makes mencyon of it also in his first Epistle to Pope Martyne the
fyft / and in his solemn sermon de funere regis. Walden. co^t. Vvicleuistas
/ in prologo doctri. 7. li. 2. ca. 66
Only soche reasons have I added thereunto / as the before named Thomas Walden
proponed to him in the time of that examinacyon / as he me^cyoneth in his first
and second books aduersus Vhi^^u^stas / with the manner of his godly
departing out of this frail life / which I found in other wrytynges and
chronicles. His youth was full of wanton wildenesse before he knew ye
scripturs / as he reports in his answer / and for the more part unknown
unto me / and therefore I write it not here. His father the lord Regnolde of
Cobham Johan Frosyart nombereth always amongst the most worthy warryours of
England.

The christen manhood of sir Johan oldecastell.
In all adue^terouse acts of wordlye manhood / was he ever bold / strong /
fortunate / doughtye / noble / and valcau^t. But never so worthy a conqueror
as in this his present conflyct with the cruel and furyouse frantyck kyngedome
of Antichrist. Far is this Christen knight more praise worthy / for that he
had so noble a stomach in defense of Christ's verite against those Romyshe
superticyons / than for any temporal nobylnesse either of blood / birth /
lands / or of marcyall feats. Cowardes i^ christ's battles.
For many thousands has had in that great corrage / which in the other have
been most faint hearted cowardes and very desperate dastardes / where as he
perseuered most faythfullye constaunt to the end. Many Popyshe parasytes and
men pleasynge flatterers have written large commendacyo^s and encomyes of
those / but of soche noble men as this was / very few or in a manner non at
all. Flatterers of great men.
Won I sometime read the works of some men learned / Parasites.
I maruele not a little to se them so abundaunt in vain flattering praises for
matters of no value / yea / for things to be dyspraysed rather than praised of
men that were godly wise.

Polydorus Vergilius a collectour sometime in England of the Popes Peter Pens
and afterward Archedeacon of Vvellys / Polydorus Anglice history / libro. 4.
has in this point deformed his wrytynges greatly / polutynge our English
chronycles most shamefullye with his Romyshe lies and other Italyshe beggerye*
Battles has he described there at large ^o no small discommendynges of some
Princes with were godly / No tales may be told out of scole.
but the preuye packynge of Prelates / and craftye co^ueyau^ce of the
spiritualte has he in every place almost full properly passed over. He was to
famylyar with the Bysshoppes and took to much of their counsel / when he
compyled the.xxvi. books. of his English hystorye. And not greatly is the
land beholden unto him in that work / for any large praise of erudicyon that
he has given it there. A syngular bewtye is it to a Christen regyon / when
their ancient monume^tes are garnyshed among others / No men are learned
with him / but Italianes.
with me^ne of fresh lytterature which therein has small remembrance or non.
Unless it be Gildas / Bedas / Alcuinus / Ioannes Scotus / Aldelmus / Neuburgus
/ and one or two more / non are in that whole work mencyoned concerning that /
as though England had always been most barren of men learned. This do I not
write in dysprayse of his learning / (which I know to be very excellent) but
for the abuse thereof being a most syngular gift of God.

A worthy work were that before God and manne.
I would wyshe some learned English ma^ne (as there are now most excellent fresh
wits) to set forth the English chronycles in their right shappe / as certain
other lands has done before them / all affeccyo^s set a part. I can not think
a more necessary thing to be labored to the honor of God / bewtye of the
realm / ^rudicyon of the people / and commodite of other lands / next the
sacred scripture of the Bible / than that work would be. Blasp^^mouse tryfles
are ^ English chronycles.
For truly in those they have there yet / is vice more anau^ced than vert^ /
and Romyshe blasphemye than godliness. As it may full well apere unto eyes of
right judgment / in y^ lamentable hystorye here following / and soche other /
which has been long hid in the dark. Mark dilygentlye the sentence of the
said Polydorus concerning this good lord Cobham / and there upon consydre his
good workemanshyp in other matters. In the counsel of Constaunce (says he)
was the heresye of Johan Vvycleue condemned / and two at the same time burned
in that cite which were ye chief heads of that sect. Polydorus anglice
history li. 22
All this is true / though the f^ate handelynge thereof be altogyther Italyshe.

But where as he says after / that when this was ones known to their
companyons in England / He vpholdeth holy church with lies
they conspyred in their madness against the whole clergy and fynallye
against the king also for that he was than a fawter of Christen relygyon /
having to their great captains sir Johan Oldecastell and sir Roger Acton / he
makes a most shameful lie. Fabianus. Acta consilii Constantiensis.
For how could sir Roger Acton with his company conspyre upon that occasyon /
being dead more than iiii. years before? and sir Johan Oldecastell remaynyng
all that season in Vvalys? Johan Hus suffered death at Constaunce the year of
our Lord a.M.CCCC.xv. in Iulye. Hierome of Prage in the year of our Lord
a.M.cccc.xvi. in May / which were the two heads he speaks of. Sir Roge^
Acto^ was brent with his company in the year of our Lord a.M.CCCC.xiii. in
Ianuarye / as witnesses Walden / Fabiane / and Johan Mayor in their
chronycles and wrytynges. judge y^ ill tree by his fruit.
Now reckon these nombers and years / and mark the propre conueyaunce of this
Romyshe gentylman the popes collectour / to clought up that crooked kyngedom of
theyrs. He can by soche legerdemayne both please his fryndes in England and
also at Rome.

They were enemies to holy church.
After that he follows with lie upon lie / as that they came than to London to
destroy the king / that he in his own person met with them there in arms
/ that they cowardlye fled / that some were taken there and brent out of
hand / and that the lord Cobham and sir Roger Ac^on were cast into ye tower
of London upon that occasyon. Burning was not than for tray^ours
Seems it not a matter somewhat like to the purpose (think you) that men
should be there burned for making soche an insurreccyon or tumult? I trow he
has cobled here somewhat workemanlye. And where as he says in the end / that
the king thereupon made an act / that they from thens forth should be taken as
traitors against his own person / wc were proved to follow that sect / he
makes an abhomynable lie. Vvhaldenus in sermon de fun^re regis.
For that ^cte was made only at the Bisshoppes complaynte and false suit in
the first year of his regne / and by force of that act those innocent men
than suffered. Well stored with lies.
More than.iiii. hondreth of soche manyfestlyes could I gather out of his
chronycles / much more than might more eyes and judgments do.

Now let us expende what the true cause should be of this godly mannys
condemnacyon and death / all dreams of Papists set a part. The causes of sir
Johan old castles condemnacyon.
The truth of it is / that after he had ones throughlye tasted the Christen
doctrine of Johan Vvycleue and of his disciples / and perseyued their lyuynges
aggreable to the same. He abhorred all the supersticyouse sorceryes (ceremonies
I should say) of the proud Romyshe church. F^o^ thens forth he brought all
things to the towche stone of Gods word. Johan. 5. 1. These. 5. Mat. 7. 1.
Ioha^. 4.
He tried all matters by the scripturs / and so proved their spretes whether
they were of God or nay. He maynteyned soche preachers in the dyoceses of
Cau^terburye / London / Rochestre / and Herforde / as the Bysshoppes were sore
offended with. He exhorted their prestes to a better way by the Gospel / and
when that would not help he gave the^ sharp rebukes. He admonyshed the kings
/ as Richard the second / Henrye Walden* in fascicuso zizaniorum Vvicleui.
the fourth / and Henrye the fyft of the clergyes manyfolde abuses / and put
into the parliament house certain books concerning their just reformacyon / both
in the year of our Lord a.M.ccc xcv. and in the year a.M.CCCC.x. of the
first book this is the beginning. Prima conclusio. Fabianus.
Quando ecclesia Anglie etc. which I have here left out least this treatise
should be to great. The other book was made by one Johan Puruey a mastre of art
of Oxforde. Beside the.xviii. conclusions that mastre Johan Vvycleue had put in
long before that.

In the year of our Lord a.M.ccc. ^^i. this noble lord Cobham with certain
other more / Walden* Polydorus in his^oria angloru^ lib. 20.
mocyoned the king at Vvestmyns^re in the time of his parliament / that it were
very commodyouse to England if the Romyshe Bysshoppes auctorite extended no
forther than the Occeane see or haven of Calys / co^syderynge the charges and
unquietness of suits there / and that mennys causes cond^ not be throughlye
known so far of. Vvher upon the king made this act by consent of his
lords / that no man from thens forth should sue to the Pope in any matter /
nor publyshe any excommunicacyon of his / vndrepeyne of losing their goods
with perpetual inpresonme^t. Treuisa in addico^nibus Cestrensis. Polydorus.
This and the before named book had cost him with sir Johan Chenye and other
more his life in Fabianus. Polydorus.
the sixth year after / at the craftye accusement of certain Prelates (though it
has in the chronycles an other color) had not God than most gracyously
preserved him. An other cause of his death yet besides all that has been said
before / was this. Vvhalden. co^t. Vvicleui. li. ^. Cap. ^0.
He caused all the works of Johan Vvycleue to be written at the instaunce of
Johan huss / and so to be sent into Boheme / France / Spain / Portyngale /
and other lands. Ar^a con^^lii Constariciensis. Herma^^us Shedel.
Vvherof Subinco Lepus the Archebysshop of Prage caused more than two hondreth
volumes fair written / openly to be brent afterward / as witnesses Aeneas
Siluius de origin Bohemorum.

These causes known with other more that I could rehearse / consydre whether
the world that is always so wicked was worthy to hold soche a noble
christen warryour as this was / Heb. ^. Esa. 10. Nah^. ^.
or nay? Consydre also the just ponnyshment of the lord for wicked laws that
were than made / with the exceadynge myscheues that the spiritualte than used.
And way the miserable estate that the realm was in sone after for contempt of
his eternal word. And there upon lawde his ryghtousnesse / and beware of like
contempt and plage in these days. Vvaldenusi sermon de funere regis.
In the year of our Lord a.M.cccc. xxii. departed king Henry the fyft in
his most floryshynge time / even in the beginning of the.xxxvii. year of his
age / which was abought.iiii. years after the death of this lord Cobham. His
son Henry the sixth succeeded in his rome and had the governance of this whole
realm / being but a babe of.vii^ months old and odd days. king Henry ye
vi. a babe.
What a doloure was this unto men of ripe difcressyon / naturally loving
their co^tre and regarding the common welthe thereof? yea / what a plage of God
was it after the scripturs to have a young child to their king? Esa. 3. A
plage.
And that it should the more manyfestlye apere to come that way / or of the
stroke of God / he was a chyldyshe thing all ye days of his life.

I shall give you (says the lord in his high dyspleasure) children to be
your princes / Esa. 3.
and young infauntes with out wisdom shall have the governance of you. The
years of that plage.
Wvhat wretched calamytees the realm suffered afterward for the space of more
than.iii. score years and three till the days of king Henry the seventh / yt
is unspeakable. Sens the preaching of Johan Vvycleue has the lord suffered
the pompouse Popyshe Prelates to show themselves forth in their own right
colors / that they might now in the light of his Gospel apere as they are in
deed / even spyghtfull murderers / ydolaters / and Sodomytes. Prelate^ what
the now apere.
Before his time they lurked under the glytterynge shine of hypocrefye / and
could not be seane in their mastryes. The friars with their charmynge
sophysirye threw soche a dark mist over the universal world / that
superstycyon could not be known for superstycyon / nor ydolatrye for
ydolatrye. Friars darkened all with their sophistrye.
Unspeakable fylthynesse of all fleshlye occupyenge was than called Prestes
chastyte / as yt is yet and will be till yt come to the highest / that God may
take full vengeance. Apoc. ^^.
Than was whoredom worshypped in Prelates of the church / and sacred wedlock
rekened soche a detestable vice as was worthy in a pressed most cruel death. As
was seane for example in sir William Vvyghe which was brent for the same at
Norwych in the year of our Lord. 14.28. Walden. (...) vtroque apere.


Thus was Vvhyght judged black and light darkness / so yl^ was me^ a sight
in those days. Esa. 5.
By soche means (says the Prophet) they drew wickedness unto them as yt
were with a cord / and all kinds of sin as yt were with a cart rope.
England for unthankfulness ponnyshed.
If England at that time had not been unthankful for the syngular benefyght
that God than sent them by those good me^ne / the days of Antichrist and his
beastlye brood had been shortened there long a go as yt is even now and here
after like to be more largelye. A most oryent fresshe myrrour of Christen
manhood apereth this worthy lord Cobham in our age / the veryte now open /
which was in herabsens a lamp of contempt before wordlye wise men. What ye
lord Cobham apereth now.
In him may noble men behold here playnelye a wol^ noble stomach and
precyouse faith in the mids of great Antichrists modye mustre. His courage
was of soche va^^e that yt gave him the victory over them by the clear
judgment of the scripturs / what though the worlds judgments be far
otherwise. 1. John. 5 1. Cor. ^5
And as for the cruel death which he most contumelyouslye suffered / yt is now
unto him a most plentuouse winning / for in the just quarrel was yt of his
Lord Jesus Christ. Phil. 1. Apoc. 1.

Against whom Thomas Arundell than Archebysshop of Caunterburye / so ferce as
ever was Pharao / Antiochus / Herodes or Cayphas / collected in Paul's church
at London a universal synod of all the papystycall clergy of England in the

Johan Vvitnam a mas^r^ in the new college / Johan Langedon monk of Chry
church in Caunterb^rye / William Vfforde regent of the Carmelytes / Thomas
Clayton regent of the Dominykes / Robert Gylber^ / Richard Cartysdale / Johan

servants to blow it forth a brod^ through out all the realm / that they
were there congregate for an wholesome ^nyte and reformacyon of the church of
England / to stop so the mouths of the common people. A practyse co^monlye
used of that generacyon.
Soche is always the common practyse of these subtyle sorcerers / whyls they
are in doing myschefe / to blere the eyes of the unlearned multitude with one
false craft or other.

After a certain communicacyon they concluded among themselves / A luke
practyse sought now of late but yt took not.
that yt was not possible for them to make whole Christ's cote without seem
(meaning thereby their patched Popyshe synagoge) unless certain great men
were brought out of the way / which seemed to be the chief maynteners of the
said disciples of Vvycleue. Among whom the most noble knight sir Johan
Oldecastell the lord Cobham was complained of by the general proctours / yea
rather betrayers of Christ in his faithful members / Accused for maynteynynge
the Gospel of Christ.
to be ye chief principal. Him they accused first for a mighty mayntener of
suspected preachers in ye dyoceses of London / Rochestre / and Herforde /
contrary to the minds of their ordynaryes. Not only they affermed him to
have sent thither the said preachers / but also to have assysted them there by
force of arms / not withstanding their synodall constitucyon made before to
the contrary. Last of all they accused him / Accused for his Ehristen believe.
that he was far otherwise in believe of the sacrament of the aultre / of
penance / of pilgrimage / of image worshyppynge / and of the ecclesyastycall
power / than the holy church of Rome had taught many years before.

Process against him.
In the end yt was concluded among them / that without any farther delay /
process should out against him as against a most pernycyouse heretyque. Some of
that felyshyp which were of more craftye experience than the other / would in
no case have ye matter so rashlye handeled / but thought this way much
better. A spiritual practyse.
Considering the said lord Cobham was a man of great birth and in fauer at
that time with the king / their counsel was to know first the kings mind /
to save all things right up. This counsel was well accepted / and thereupon
the Archebysshop Thomas Arundell with his other Bysshoppes and a great part of
the clergy went straight ways unto the king as than remaining at kenyngton.
A woluyshe generacyon.
And there they laid forth most grenouse complayntes against the said lord
Cobham / to his great infamye and blemyshe / being a man most godly. The
king gentyllye hard those blood thurstye rauenours / The king speaks for
him.
and far otherwise than became his princelye dignite he ins^au^tlye desired
them / that in respect of his noble stock and knyghthode they should yet
fauorablye deal with him. And that they would if yt were possible / without
all rygour or extreme handelynge reduce him again to the churches unity. His
gentle promise.
He promised them also that in case they were contented to take some
delyberacyon / his self would seryouslye common the matter with him.

Anon after the king sent for the said lord Cobham. And as he was come / he
called him secretlye admonyshyng him betwixt him and him / to submyt himself
to his mother the holy church / His admonyshme^t
and as an obedyent child to acknowledge himself culpable / unto whom the
Christen knight made this answer / you most worthy prince says he^ am I
always prompt and willing to obey / for so much as I know you a Christen
king and the appointed minystre of God bearyng his ryghtuouse sword to the
ponnyshment of ill doers and for the sauegarde of them that be virtuous. Unto
you next my eternal living God owe I my whole obedience / Romans 13. 1. Pet. 2.
and submyt me thereunto (as I have done ever all that I have either of fortune
or nature / redye at all times to fulfill what so ever ye shall in that lord
command me. A most Christen obedience.
But as touching the Pope and his spiritualte / truly I owe the^ neither sure
nor service / for so much as I know him by the scripturs to be the great
Antichrist / the son of perdicyon / the open aduersarye of God / and the
abhominacyon standing in the holy place. 2. These. 2. Mat. 24.
When the king had heard this with soche like sentences more he would talk
no longar with him / but left him so utterly.

And as the Archebysshop resorted again unto him for an answer / he gave him
his full auctorite to cite him / examyne him / and ponnyshe him according to
the deuylyshe decrees / which they call the laws of holy church. Ex vetusto
exemplari Condinensiu^.
Than the said Archebyshop by the counsel of his other Bysshoppes and clergy
/ appointed to call before him ye said sir Johan Oldecastell the lord Cobham /
and to cause him personallye to apere / to answer to soche suspected artycles
as they should lay against him. Cayphas seeks Christ.
So sent he forth his chief sommener with a very sharp cytacyon unto the
castle of Cowlynge / where as he at that time dwelt for his solace. Judas is
sent forth
And as ye said sommener was thither common / he durst in no case enter the
gates of so noble a man without his lycens / and therefore he returned home
again / his massage not done. An other Judas yet is hyered.
Than called the Archebysshop one Johan Butler unto him which was than the
dorekeper of the kings preuye chamber / and with him he couenaunted through
promyses and rewards / to have this matter craftelye brought to pass under ye
kings name.

Whereupon the said Johan Butler took the Archebysshoppes sommener with him /
Judas kisseth and betrayeth
and went unto the said lord Cobham / showing him that it was the kings
pleasure that he should obey that cytacyon / and so cyted him frawde lentlye.
Than said he unto them in few words / that in no case would he consent to
those most deuylyshe practyses of the Prestes. The malice of the serpent.
As they had infourmed ye Archebysshop of that answer / and that yt was mete
for no man pryuatelye to cite him after that without parell of life / he
decreed by and by to have him cyted by publyque process or open commandment.
Mark this relygyon of ye papists.
And in all the have possible upon the wedynsdaye before the Natiuite of our
Lady in Septembre / he commanded letters cytatorye to be set upon the great
gates of the cathedral church of Rochestre (which was but iii. English miles
from thens) chargynge him to apere personallye before him at Ledys in the.xi.
day of the same month and year / all excuses to the contrary set a part.
The cytacyons taken down.
Those letters were taken down anon after by soche as bare fauer unto the
lord Cobham / and so conveyed a side. After that caused the Archebyshop new
letters to be set up / on the Natyuyte day of our Lady / which also were
rent down and utterly consumed.

Than for so much as he ded not apere at the day appointed at Ledys where as
he fate in consystorye as cruel as ever was Cayphas with his court of
hypocrytes about him he judge him / Cayphas sytteth in consystorye.
denounced him / and condemned him of most deep contumacye. After that when he
had been falselye infourmed by his hired spies and other glosynge glauerers /
False accusacyo^s against him.
that the seyde lord Cobham had law head him to scorn / dysdayned all his
doings / maynteyned his old opynyo^s contemned the churches power / the
dignyte of a Bishop / and the order of presthode (for of all these was he than
accufed) in his modye madness without just proof ded he openly excommunicate
him. The serpent does his nature.
yet was he not with all this ferce tyranny qualyfyed / but commanded him to
be cyted a fresh / to apere before him the Saturdaye before the feast of saynct
Matthew the Apostle / with these cruel threttenynges added theru^to. That if
he ded not obey at that day / he would more extremelye handle him. And to
make himself more strong toward the perfourmaunce thereof / he compelled the
lay power by most terryble manacynges of curses and interdiccyons / Se here
how spiritual they be.
to assyst him against that sedycyouse apostata / that scysmatyque / that
heretyque / that troubler of the publyque peace / that enemy of the realm /
and great aduersarye of all holy church / for all these hateful names ded he
give him.

This most constaunt servant of the lord and worthy knight sir Johan
Oldecastell the lord Cobham / A myrror of Christian knight hode.
beholdynge the vnpacable furye of Antichrist thus kyndled against him /
perscyuynge himself also compased on every side with deadlye dangers / he
took paper and pen in hand / and so wrote a Christen confession or rekenyng
of his faith (which follows here after) and both sygned and sealed it with his
own hand. He confesses his God before men.
Vvherin he also answers to the iiii. chefest artycles that the Archebysshop
laid against him. That done he took the copye with him / and went therewith to
the king / trusting to find mercy and fauer at his hand. The Apostles faith
Non other was that confession of his than the common believe or sum of the
churches faith / called the Apostles creed / of all Christen men than used.
As thus.

The Christen believe of the lord Cobham.
I Believe in God the father almyghtye / maker of heaven and earth. The common
creed of Christyanes.
And in Jesus Christ his only son our Lord / which was co^c^yued of the
holy ghost / borne of the virgin Marye / suffered death under Ponce Pylate /
crucyfyed / dead / and buried / went down to helles / the third day rose
again from death / This faith was not regarded.
ascended up to heavens / he sytteth on the right hand of God the father
almyghtye / and from thens shall come again to judge the quycke and the dead.
I believe in the holy ghost / the universal holy church / the communyon of
saynctes / the forgiveness of s^nnes / the vprysynge of the flesh / and
everlasting life / Amen.

And for a more large declaracyon (says he) of this my faith in the catholyck
church. A declaracyon of his believe.
I stedefastlye believe that there is but one God almighty / in and of whose
Godhede are these.iii. persons / the father / the son / and the holy ghost
/ and that those.iii. persons are the same self God almyghtye. 1. Joan. 9.
I believe also that the second person of this most blessed Trinite in most
co^uenyent time appointed thereunto before / Gal. 4. Joan. 1. Luc. 2.
took flesh and blood of the most blessed virgyne Marye for the sauegarde and
redempcyon of the universal kind of man / which was before lost in Adams
offense. Christ is the only head of his church.
More over I believe that the same Jesus Christ over Lord / thus being both
God and manne / is the only head of ye whole Christen church / and that all
those that has been or shall be saved / be members of this most holy church.
And this holy church I think to be dy^^ded into.iii. sorts or companyes.

The church diuyded in.iii. partis.
Vvherof the first sort be now in heaven / and they are the saynctes from hens
departed. These / as they were here conuersaunt conformed always there lines to
the most holy laws and pure examples of Christ / renouncing satan / the
world / and the flesh with all their concupyscences and cuyls. The second
sort are in purgatory (if any soche he by the scripturs) abiding the mercy
of God and a full delyueraunce of pain. Contrary wrote he / Ad parliamentum.
Ex Vvhaldeno.
^ The third sort are here upon the earth and be called the church
mylytaunt. For day and nyghe they comende against the craftye assaults of the
devil / the flattering prosperytees of this world / and the rebellyouse
fylthynesse of the flesh.

This latter congregacyon by the just ordinance of God is also severed into
iii. diverse estates / The chu^che mylytaunt divided in.iii.
that is to say / into presthode / knyghthode and the commons Among whom the
will of God is / that the one should aid the other / but not destroy the
other. The Prestes first of all secluded from all worldlynesse / should
conform their lives utterly to the examples of Christ and his Apostles. What
^ Prestes should be.
Evermore should they be occupied in preaching and teaching the scripturs
purelye / and in genynge wholesome counsels of good living to the other two
degrees of men. More modest also / more loving / gentle / and lowlye in
sprete should they be / than any other sorts of people.

In knyghthode are all they which bear sword by law of office. knyghthode
what it should do.
These should defend Gods laws / and se that the Gospel were purelye taught /
conformynge their lives to the same and secludynge all false preachers. yea /
these ought rather to hasarde their lives than to suffer soche ^^ycked decrees
as either blemysheth the eternal testament of God or yet lets the fre
passage thereof / whereby her syes and scysmes might spring in the church.
Mark here a most Christen heart.
For of non other arise they (as I suppose) than of soche erronyouse
constitucyo^s / craftelye first crepynge in under hypocrytes lies for
advantage. They ought also to preserve Gods people from oppressers / tyrauntes
/ and thieves / and to se the clergy supported so long as they teach purelye
/ pray ryghtlye / and mynystre the sacraments frelye. The clergy wherefore
supported.
And if they se them do other wise / they are bound by law of office to
compel them to change their doings / and to se all things performed
according to Gods prescript ordinance.

The latter felyshyp of this church / are the common people / whose duty is
to bear their good minds and true obedyence to the aforeseyd mynysters of God
/ their kings / cyuyle governors / and Prestes. What ye common people ought
to do.
The right office of these is iustlye to occupye every ma^ne in his faculte /
be yt merchandyce / handye craft / or the tylthe of the ground. And so one of
them to be as an helper to an other / ^olowynge always in their sorts the
just commandments of their Lord God.

Over and besides all this / I most faythfullye believe that the sacraments of
Christ's church are necessary to all Christen beleuers / Believe concerning
the sacraments.
this always seen to / that they be truly mynystred according to Christ's
first instytucyon and ordinance. And for so much as I am malycyoulye and most
falselye accused of a mysbeleue in the sacrament of the aultre / to the
hurtful slaundre of many. I sygnyfye here unto all men that this is my
faith concerning that. The sacrament of the aultre
I believe in that sacrament to be contained very Christ's body and blood
under the symylytudes of bread and wine / yea the same body that was
conceived of the holy ghost / borne of Marye ye virgyne / done on the cross /
dyed / that was buried / arose the third day from the death / and is now
gloryfyed in heaven. Believe concerning Gods laws.
I also believe the universal law of God to be most true and perfyght / and
that they which do not so follow it in their faith and works at one time or
other / can never be saved. Where as he that seeks yt in faith / accepts yt
/ lerneth yt / delyghteth therein / and perfourmeth yt in love / shall taste for
yt the felycyte of everlasting innocencye.

what god ^ xeth of a Christian.
Fynallye this is my faith also / that God will axe no more of a Christen beleuer
in this life / but only to obey the precepts of that most blessed law. If
any Prelate of the church requires more / or else any other kind of
obedyence than this to be used / he contemns Christ exalting himself above
God / and so becomes an open Antichrist. All these premysses I believe
partycularlye / and generallye all that God has left in his holy scripturs
that I should believe. Instauntlye desyerynge you my lyege lord and most worthy
king / A Christ desire of ye lord Cobham.
that this confession of mine may be iustlye examyned by the most godly wise
and learned men of your realm. And if yt be found in all points agreynge to
the veryte / than let yt be so allowed / and I thereupon holden for non other
them a true Christyane. This request was lawful
If yt be proved otherwise / than let yt be utterly condemned / provided
always that I be taught a better believe by the word of God / and I shall most
reuerentlye at all times obey thereunto.

Obedience unto his king.
This brefe confession of his faith / the lord Cobham wrote (as is mencyoned
before) and so took yt with him to the court / offering yt with all meekness
unto the king to read yt over. The king would in no case receive yt / but
commanded yt to be delivered unto them that should be his judges. Than desired
he in the kings presens that an hundred knights and esquyres might be
suffered to come in upon his purgacyon / which (he knew) would clear him of
all heresies. His Christen stomach and manhood.
Moreover he offered himself after the law of arms to fight for life or
death with any ma^ne living Christen or Heythen in the quarrel of his faith /
the king and the lords of his counsel excepted. No reasonable offer would
serve.
Fynallye with all gentylnesse he protested before all that were present / that
he would refuse no manner of correccyon that should after the laws of God be
mynystred unto him / but that he would at all times with all meekness obey
yt. Not withstanding all this / the king suffered him to be sommoued
personallye in his own preuye chamber.

Than said the lord Cobham to the king / His appele from ye Archebisshop.
that he had appeled from the Archebysshop to the Pope of Rome / and therefore
he ought (he said) in no case to be his judge. And having his appele there at
hand redye written / he showed yt with all reverence to the king. Vvherwith
the king was than much more dyspleased than before / and said angerlye unto
him / that he should not pursue his appele. The king h^re worshyppeth the b^ast.
But rather he should tarrye in hold / till soche time as yt were of the Pope
allowed. And than / would he or nylde he / the Archebysshop should be his judge.
Thus was there nothing allowed that the good lord Cobham had lawfullye before
required. But for so much as he would not be sworn in all things to submyt
himself to the church / Cobham would not obey Antichrist.
and so to take what penance the Archebysshop would enjoin him / he was
arested again at the kings commandment / and so led forth to the tower of
London / to keep his day (so was yt than spoken) that the Archebysshop had
appointed him before in the kings chamber.

Than caused he the aforeseyd confession of his faith to be copyed again and
the answer also which he had made to the.iiii. articles proponed against him
to be written in manner of an indenture in two shetes of paper. His confession
and answer newly copyed.
That wha^ he should come to his answer / he might give the one copye unto the
Archebysshop / and reserve the other to himself. As the day of examynacyon
was comen / which was the.xxiii day of Septembre or the saturdaye before the
feast of saynct Matthew / Thomas Arundell Cayphas sytteth in consystorye.
the Archebysshop sitting in Cayphas rome in the chaptre house of Paul's with
Richard Clyfforde Bishop of London / and Henrye Bolyng broke Bishop of
Vvynchestre / sir Robert Morleye knight / and Lef^tenaunt of the tower /
brought personallye before him the said lord Cobham / and there left him for
the time / Unto whom the Archebysshop said these words.

The first examynacyon of the lord Cobham. antichrist was here in full power.

SIr Johan / in ye last general co^nocacyon of the clergy of this our
province / ye were detected of cert^n heresies and by suffycye^t witnesses
found culpable. Whereupon ye were by form of spiritual law cyted / and
would in no case apere. In co^clusyon upon your rebellyouse contumacye ye were
both pryuatelye and openly excommunycated. antichrist manyfesteth himself.
Notwithstanding we never yet showed oures^lfe vnredye to have given you your
absolucyon (nor yet do not to this hour) would ye have mekely a yed yt. Unto
this the lord Cobham showed as though he had given no^ ear / having his
mind otherwise occupied / and so desired non absolucyon. But he said / he
would gladlye before him and his brethren make rehersall of that faith /
which he held and intended always to stand to / if yt would please them to
lycens him thereunto. A sign of gods true servant.
And than he took out of his bosom a certain writing endented / concerning
the artycles whereof he was accused / and so openly read yt before them /
geuynge yt unto the Archebyshop as he had made thereof an end. Vvherof this is
the copye.

I Johan Oldecastell knight and lord Cobham / Ex viroque exemplari.
will all Christen men to understand / that Thomas Arundell Archebysshop of
Cau^terburye has not only laid yt to my charge malycyouslye / but also very
untruly by his lettre and seal written against me in most slaunderouse wise /
that I should otherwise feel and teach of the sacraments of the church
(assygnynge specyallye the sacrament of the aultre / The artycles laid against
ye lord Cob
the sacrament of penance / the worshyppynge of images / and the going of
pilgrimage unto them) far other wise than either believes or teaches the
universal holy church. I take almyghtye God unto witness / that yt has
been and now is / and evermore with the help of God yt shall be my full intent
and will / to believe faythfullye and whollye all the sacraments that ever God
ordained to be mynystred in the holy church. O most Christen knight.
And more over for to declare me in these.iiii. points before rehearsed.

I believe that in the most worshypfull sacrament of the aultre is Christ's
very body in form of bread / His believe concerning the sacraments.
the same body that was borne of the blssed virgyne Marye / done on the cross
/ dead / and buried / and that the third day arose from death to life / the
which body is now gloryfyed with the father in heaven. And as for the
sacrament of penance / Consydre him here before bisshoppes.
I believe that yt is needful to all them that shall be saved / to forsake
their sin and to do penance for yt / with true contrycyon to God /
confession of their fawtes / and dew satisfaccyon in Christ / like as Gods
laws lymyteth and teaches / else can they have no salvation. This penance I
desire all men to do. Permytted to brige in ydolatrye.
And as for images / I understand that they perteyne nothing to our Christen
believe / but were permytted (long sens the faith was given us of Christ) by
sufferau^ce of the church / for to be as kalenders unto lay men to
represent or bring to mind the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ with the
martyrdom and good living of the saynctes.

Who co^mytreth ydolatrye
I think also that what so over he be which does that worship to dead images
that is dewlye belonging unto God / or that puts his faith / hope / or
confydence in the help of them as he should do only in his eternal living
God / or that has affection in one more than in an other / he perpetrateth in
so doing ^^ abhomynable sin of ydolatrye. Moreover in this am I fullye
persuaded / that every manne dwelling Mark. Genesis 23. Psalm. 2.
on this earth is a pilgrim / either toward bless or else toward pain. And
that he which knows not / nor will no^ know / nor yet keep the holy
commandments of God in his living here all be yt that he goth on pilgrimage
into all quarters of the world) if he departs so he shall surely be
dampened. Saved without pilgrimage.
Again he that knows the holy commandments of God / and so perfourmeth
them to the end of his life to his power / shall without fail be saved in
Christ / though he never in his life go on pilgrimage as men use now a days
to Cau^terburye / Vvalsyngham / Compostell / and Rome / or to any other place
else.

This answer to his artycles thus ended and read / he delivered yt to the
Bysshoppes as is said before. His answer examyned.
Than cou^fessed the Archebysshop with the other two Bysshoppes and with
diverse of ye doctors what was to be done in thisma^ter / commaundynge him for
the time to stand a side. In conclusyon by their assent and infourmacyon / he
said thus unto him. What is this else than quarellynge?
Come hydre sir Johan. In this your writynge are many good things contained /
and right catholyck also / we deny yt not. But ye must consydre that this day
was appointed you to answer to other points concerning those artycles /
whereof as yet no mencyon is made in this your byll. And therefore ye must yet
declare us your mind more playnelye. Their bellyes only ded those belly
gods seek.
As thus whether that ye hold / afferme / and believe / that in the sacrament
of the aultre after the consecracyon ryghtlye done by a pressed / remains
materyall bread or not? Moreover whether ye do hold / afferme / and believe /
that as concerning the sacrament of penance (where as a competent nombre of
Prestes are) every Christen manne is necessarylye bound to be confessed of
his sins to a pressed ordained by the church / or not?

His Christian answer unto their qua^ellynges
After certain other communycacyon this was the answer of the good lord Cobham.
That non otherwise would he declare his mind / nor yet answer unto his
artycles / than was expreslye in his writing there contained. Than said the
Archebyshop again unto him Sir Johan beware what ye do. For if ye answer not
clerelye to those things that are here objected against you / A tyrannouse
who^e is that mother.
specyallye at the time appointed you only for that purpose / the law of
holy church is / that compelled ones by a judge / we may openly proclaim ye
an heretyque. Unto whom he gave this answer. Do as ye shall think yt best /
for I am at a point. What so ever he and the other Bysshoppes ded ask him
after that / he bad them resort to his byll for thereby would he stand to the
very death. His answer not to their minds
Other answer would he not give that day / wherewith the Bishops and
Prelates were in a manner amassed and wonderfullye dysquyeted. At the last the
Archebysshop counseled again with his other Bysshoppes and doctors. And in
the end thereof declared unto him / antichrist sets me^ above God.
what the holy church of Rome following the sayings of saint Austyn / saint
Hierom / saint Ambrose / and of other holy doctors / had determined in those
matters / no manner of mencyon ones made of Christ. Which determynacyon (says
he) ought all Christen men both to believe and to follow.

Than said the lord Cobham unto him / The lord Cobha^ resorteth us to Christ.
that he would gladlye both believe and observe what so ever the holy church of
Christ's institucyon had determined / or yet what so ever God had willed him
either to believe or to do. But that the Pope of Rome with his Cardynals /
Archebysshoppes / Bysshoppes and other Prelates of that church had lawful
power to determyne soche matters as stood not with his word throughlye / that
would he not (he said) at that time afferme. A delay of these deuyls to
destroy.
With this the Archebyshop bad him to take good abuysement till the Monedaye
next following (which was the.xxv. day of Septembre) and than iustlye to
answer / specyallye unto this point / whether there remained materyall bread
in ye sacrament of the aultre after the words of consecracyon / or not? He
promised him also to send unto him in writing / those matters clerelye
determined / that he might than be the more perfyght in his answer making. A
doctrine of deuyls to blind ye simple.
And all this was not else but to blind the multitude with somewhat. The next
day following / according to his promise the Archebysshop sent unto him in to
the tower this folyshe and blasphemouse writing / made by him and by his
unlearned clergy.

The determynacyon of the Archebysshop and clergy.
THe faith and determynacyon of holy Church towchynge the blesfull sacrament
of the aultre / is this. Ex magno processu Thome Arundelis
That after the sacramental words be ones spoken by a Pressed in his Mass /
the materyall bread that was before bread / is turned into Christ's very
body. And the materyall wine that was before wine / is turned into Christ's
very blood. The first article.
And so there remains in the sacrament of the aultre from thens forth no
materyall bread nor materyall wine / which were there before the sacramental
words were spoken. How believe ye this article? Holy church has determined /
The second article
that every Christen manne living here bodylye upon earth / ought to be
shryuen to a pressed ordained by ye church if he may come to him. How f^le ye
this article?

Christ ordained saynct Peter ye Apostle to be his vycar here in earth. The
third article
Whose see is the holy church of Rome. And he granted that the same power
which he gave unto Peter / should succeed to all Peter's successors / which we
call now Popes of Rome. The sede of the serpent.
By whose special power in churches partycular be ordained Prelates / as
Arch^bysshoppes / Bysshoppes / persons / curates / and other degrees more.
Unto whom Christen men ought to obey after the laws of the church of Rome.
This is the determynacyon of holy church. How feleye this article? The.iiii.
article.
Holy church has determined that yt is merytoryouse to a Christen manne to
go on pilgrimage to holy places. And there specyallye to worship holy
relyques and images of saynctes / Apostles / Martyrs / Confessors / and all
other saynctes besides approved by the church of Rome. He se there ignorance
and malice.
How feel ye this article?

And as the good lord Cobham had read over this wretched writing / he
marueled greatly of their mad ignorance. But that he considered again that
God had given them over for their vnbeleues sake / into most deep errors and
blyndnesse of soul. Again he perseyued thereby that their uttermost malice was
purposed against him / how so ever he should answer. And therefore he put his
life into the hands of God / defyerynge his only sprete to assyst him in his
next answer. He putt his life in Gods hands.
When the said xxv. day of Septembre was come / (which was also the Monedaye
before Myhelmesse) in the said year of our lord a.M.CCCC. and.xiii. Thomas
Arundell the Archebysshop of Caunter burye commanded his iudycyall scate to be
removed from ye chaptre house of Paul's to the Domynyck friars within Ludgate
at London. Ex vtroque exemplari.
And as he was there set with Richard ye Bishop of London. Henrye the Bishop
of Vvynchestre / and Benet the Bishop of Bangor / he called in unto him his
counsel and his officers / with diverse other Doctors and friars. Of whom
these are the names here following.

The counsel of Layphas
Mastre Henrye Vvare / the Offycyall of Caunterburye / Phylip Morgan / doctor of
both laws / Howest kyffyn / doctor of the cano^ law / Johan kempe / doctor
of the cano^ law Vvistyam Carleton / doctor of the canon law / Johan Vvytnam
/ of the new college in Oxforde / Ioha^ Vvhyght head / a doctor of Oxforde
also / Robert Vvombewell / vycar of saynct Laurence in the Iewrye / The
Pharysees and scrybes.
Thomas Palmer / the wardene of the Mynors / Robert Chamberlayne / prior of the
Domynyckes / Richard Dodyngton / prior of the Augustynes / Thomas Walden /
prior of the Carmelytes / all doctors of diuinyte. Johan Steuens also / and
James Cole / both notaryes / appointed there purposelye to write all that should
be either said or done. A rabble of Antichrists.
All these with a great sort more of Prestes / Monks / Chano^s friars /
parryshe clerks / Bell ryngers / and pardoners dysdayned him with innumerable
mockes and scorns / reckoning him to be an horrible heretyque and a man
acursed before God.

Anon the Archebysshop called for a masseboke / and caused all those Prelates
and doctors to swear thereupon / that every manne should faythfullye do his
office and duty that day. Blasphemouse dissymulacyon of papists.
And that neither for fauer nor fear / love nor hate of the one party nor the
other / any thing should there be wytnessed / spoken / or done / but
according to the truth / as they would answer before God and all the world
at the day of Dome. For a false color swear they.
Than were the two forseyd notaryes sworn also / to write and to witness the
words and process that there should be uttered on both parties / and to say
their minds (if they otherwise knew yt) before they should regestre yt. And
all this dissymulacyon was / but to color their myscheues before the ignorant
multitude. All done to deceive the ignorant.
Consydre herin (gentle reader) what this wicked generacyon is / and how far
wide from the just fear of God / for as they were tha^ / so are they yet to
this day.

After that came forth before them sir Robert Morleye knight and Lyeftenaunt of
the tower / and he brought with him the good lord Cobham / there leaving him
among them as a lamb among wolves / to his examynacyon and answer. Here
comes he before them


The latter examynacyon of the lord Cobham. Ex vetusto exemplari ^on dinensium.

THan said the Archebysshop unto him: lord Cobham / ye be aduysed (I am sure)
of the words and process which we had unto you upon saturdaye last past in
the chaptre house of Paul's. Which process were now no long to be rehearsed
again. I said unto you than that ye were a cursed for your contumacye and
dysobedyence to holy Church / The curse of Antichrist.
thinking that ye should with meekness have desired your absolucyon.

Than spoke the lord Cobham with a most cherefull countenance / and said: God
says by his holy Prophet / Malac. 2.
Maledicam benedictionus vestris / which is as much to say / as I shall curse
where as you bless.

The Archebysshop made than as though he had continued forth his tale and not
heard him / saying: A woluyshe offer of gentylnesse.
Sir at that time I gentyllye proffered to have assoyled you / if ye would have
asked yt. And yet I do the same / if ye will humblye desire yt in dew form
and manner as holy church has ordained.

Than said the lord Cobham. Nay forsooth will I not for I never yet trespased
against you / and therefore I will not do yt. And with that he kneled down on
the pauement / holding up his hands toward heaven / and said. He confesses
himself unto God.
I shryue me here unto the / my eternal living God / that in my frail youth
I offended the (lord) most greuouslye in pride / wrath / and gluttony / in
covetousness and in lechere. Many men have I hurt in mine anger / and done
many other horrible sins / good Lord I ask the mercy. And therewith
wepynglye he stood up again and said with a mighty voice. O Christe^knyght
Lo good people lo. For the breaking of Gods law and his great
commandments / they never yet cursed me. But for their own laws and
tradycyons most cruellye do they handle both me and other men. And therefore
both they and their laws by the promise of God shall utterly be destroyed.
Hiere. 51. Apoc. 1^.


At this the Archebysshop and his company were not a little blemyshed.
Notwithstanding he took stomach unto him again after certain words had in
excuse of their tyranny / and examyned the lord Cobham of his Christen believe.

Vvher unto the lord Cobham made this godly answer. The christian believe of
Cobha^
I believe (says he) fullye and faythfullye the universal laws of God. I
believe that all is true wc is contained in ye holy sacred scripturs of the
Bible / fynallye I believe all that my lord God would I should believe.

Than demanded the Archebisshop an answer of the byll which he and the
clergy had sent him into the tower the day before in manner of a determinacyon
of the church concerning the.iiii. artycles whereof he was accused /
specyallye for the sacrament of the aultre / how he believed therein? A
blasphemouse determynacyon of antichrist


Whereunto the lord Cobham said / that with that byll he had nothing to do.
But this was his believe (he said) concerning the sacrament. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.
Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11.
That his lord and sauer Jesus Christ / sitting at his last supper with his
most dear disciples / the night before he should suffer / took bread in his
hand. And ge^ynge thanks to his eternal father / blessed yt / brake yt / and
so gave yt unto them saying. Take yt unto ye / and eat thereof all. This is my
body which shall be betrayed for you. antichrist allows not this faith.
Do this here after in my remembrance. This do I throughlye believe (says he)
for this faith am I taught of the Gospel in Matthew / in Mark / and in Luke
/ and also in the first Epistle of saynct Paul to the Corintheanes.

Than asked the Archebysshop if he believed that yt were bread after the
consecracyon or sacramental words spoken ^uer yt.

The sacrament of ye aultre.
The lord Cobham said. I believe that in the sacrament of the aultre is Christ's
very body in form of bread / the same that was borne of the virgyne Marye
/ done on the cross / dead / and buried / and that the third day arose from
death to life / which now is gloryfyed in heaven.

Than said one of the doctors of law. A membre of satan.
After the sacramental words be uttered / there remains no bread / but the
only body of Christ.

The lord Cobham said than to one mastre Johan Vvhyght head. All this would
not help.
you said ones unto me in the castle of Cowlynge / that the sacred oost was
not Christ's body. But I held than against you / and proved that therein was
his body / though the seculars and friars could not therein agree / but held
yche one against other in that opinion. These were my words tha^ / if ye
remember it.

A blasphemouse broad.
Than showted a sort of them together and cried with great noise. We say all
that yt is Gods body.

And diverse of them asked him in great anger / whether it were materyall
bread after the consecracyon / or not?

Than looked the lord Cobham ernestlye upon the Archebysshop / and said. That
is not enough.
I believe surely that yt is Christ's body in form of bread. Sir believe not
you thus?

And the Archebysshop said / yes marry do I.

Than asked him the doctors / whether yt were only Christ's body after the
consecracyon of a Pressed and no bread or not?

And he said unto them / It is both Christ's body and bread. Neither will
scripture nor reason serve.
I shall prove yt as thus. For like as Christ dwelling here upon the earth /
had in him both Godhede and manhede. And had the inuisyble ^odhede covered
under that manhede which was only visyble and seane in him. So in the
sacrament of the aultre is Christ's very body and very bread also / as I
believe. The bread is the thing that we se with our eyes. This opinion has
saynct Augustyn.
) The body of Christ / (which is his flesh and his blood) is there under
hid and not seane / but in faith.

Than smyled they yche one upon other / that the people should judge him taken
in a great heresye. And with a great brag diverse of them said. It is a foul
heresye.

The po^^s diuynyte.
Tha^ asked the archebysshopp / what bread yt was. And the doctors also
inquyred of him whether it were materyall or not?

The lord Cobham said unto them. Materyall.
The scripturs makes no mencyon of this word materyall / and therefore my
faith has nothing to do therewith. But this I say and believe yt / that yt is
Christ's body and bread. Joan. 6.
For Christ said in the sixth of Ioha^s gospel / Ego sum panis viu^s qui de
celo descendi. I which came down from heaven am the living and not the dead
bread. Therefore I say now again / like as I said before. As our lord Jesus
Christ is very god and very manne / so in the most blessed sacrament of the
aultre / is Christ's very body and bread. Mark.


Than said they all with one voice. It is an heresye.

One of the bysshoppes stood up by and by / and said. An heresye / after the
papystes.
What yt is an heresye manifest / to say that yt is bread after the
sacrame^tall words be ones spoken / but Christ's body only.

The lord Cobham said. Saint paul ye apostle was (I am sure) as wise as you
be now / and more godly learned. 1. Co. 10
And he call^^ yt bread / writynge to the Corintheanes. The bread that we
break (says he) is yt not the partakynge of the body of Christ? Lo / he
casts yt bread and not Christ's body / but a men whereby we receive
Christ's body.

Than said they again. O ignorant beasts.
Paul must be otherwise understood. For yt is surely an heresye to say
that yt is bread after the consecration / but only Christ's body.

The lord Cobham asked how they could make Good that sentence of there is.

They answered him thus. Blind babylonyanes.
For yt is against the determynacyon of holy church.

Than said the Archebysshopp unto him. Sir Johan / we sent you a writynge
concerning the faith of this blessed sacrament / clerelye determined by the
church of Rome our mother and by the holy doctors.

Than said he again unto him. A most Christen answer.
I know non holyar than is Christ and his Apostle. And as for that
determynacyo^ I wote^ yt is non of there is / for yt stands not with the
scripturs / but manyfestlye against the^. If yt be the churches (as ye say it
is) it has been hers only sens she received the great poison Poison.
of worldly possessions / and not before

Than asked they him to stop his mouth therewith. If he believed not in the
determynacyon of the church.

And he said unto them. No forsooth / for yt is no God. In all our creed is in
but thryse mencyoned concerning believe. In / but thryse in all the creed.
In God the father / in God the son / in God the holy ghost. The birth / the
death / the buryall / the resurreccyon and ascensyon of Christ has non in for
believe but in him. Neither yet has the church / the sacraments / the
forgiveness of sin / the latter resurreccyon / nor yet the life everlasting
any other in than in the holy ghost.

Confounded in their own learning.
Than said one of the lawers. Tushe / that was but a word of office. But what
is your believe concerning holy church?

The lord Cobham answered. My believe is (as I said before) that all the
scripturs of the sacred Bible are true. All that is grounded upon them I believe
throughlye. For (I know) yt is Gods pleasure that I should so do. But in your
lordelye laws and ydell determynacyons have I no believe. He believes not in
the Pope.
For ye be no part of Christ's holy church / as your open deeds does show.
But ye are very Antichrists / obstynatlye set against his holy law and
will. The laws that you have made are nothing to his glory / but only for
your vain glory and abhomynable couetuousnesse.

This they said was an exceadynge heresye (and that in a gr^a^ f^^me) not to
believe the determynacyon of holy church. An heresye after the Papystes.


Than the Archebysshop asked him / what he thought holy church?

He said unto him: My believe is that holy Church is the nombre of them /
which shall be saved / of whom Christ is the head. Consydre him to be than in
shrewed handelynge.
Of this church one part is in heaven with Christ / an other in purgatory
(you say and the third is here in earth. This latter part stands in three
degrees / in kynghthode / pressed hode / and the commynnalte / as I said before
playnelye in the confession of my believe.

Than said the archebisshop unto him Can ye tell me / who is of this church?

The lord Cobham answered. Walden. co^tr. Vvicleuistas / lib. 2. ar. 3. Cap.
67.
yea truly can I.

Than said doctor Walden the prior of the Carmelytes. It is doubt unto you /
who is thereof. For Christ says in Math. Nolite iudicare. Presinne to judge no
ma^ne. If ye here beforbydde^ ye judgment of your neyber or brother / much
more ye judgment of your superyour.

The lord Cobham made him this answer. Christ says also in the same self
chaptre of Matthew. That like as the ys^'tre is known by his ill fruit / Mat.
7.
so is a false Prophet by his works / a^ere they never so gloryouse. But that
ye left behind ye. And in Johan he has this text. Joan. 10. Joan. 7. Deuteronomy. 1.
Operibus credit. Believe you the outward doings. And in an other place of
Johan. Iustum iudicium indicate. When we know the thing to be true / we may
so judge yt and not offend. For David says also. Recte iudicate filii
hominum. Judge ryghtlye always ye children of men And as for your
superyorte. Psalm. 56.
Were ye of Christ ye should be meke mynysters / and no proud superyours.

Than said doctor Walden unto him. ye make here no difference of judgments.
ye put no diuerfyte betwyne the ill judgments / Diuersyte of iud^eme^tes.
which Christ has forbidden / and the good judgments which he has
cu^maunded us to have. Rash judgment and right judgment / all is one with
you. So is judgment presumed and judgment of office. So swyst judges always
/ are the learned scolers of Vvycleue.

Unto whom the lord Cobham thus answered. It is well sophistryed of you
forsooth. A perfyght answer. Esa. 5. Esa. 55.
Preposterous are your judgments evermore. For as the Prophet Esaye says
/ ye judge ill good and good ill. And therefore the same Prophet concludes /
that your ways are not gods ways / nor Gods ways your ways. And as for
that virtuous manne Vvyclene / whose judgments ye so hyghlye dysdayne / I
shall say here for my part both before God and manne. That before I knew that
despised doctrine of his / I never abstayned from sin. Vvhalden* in
prefatione. doctrina. 7.
But sens I learned therein to fear my Lord God / yt has otherwise (I trust)
been with me. So much grace could I never find in all your gloryouse
instruccyo^s.

Than said doctor Walden again yet unto him. A most rank papist.
It were not well with me / so many virtuous men living / and so many
learned men teaching / the scripturs being also so open / and the examples of
fathers so plentuouse / if I than had no grace to amend my life till I heard
the devil preach. Saint Hierom says / that he which seeks soche suspected
masters / shall not find the myd day light but the myd day devil. Hierony.
(...)ario minori.


The lord Cobham said / your fathers the old Pharysees ascrybed Christ's
miracles to Beelzebub / and his doctrine to the devil. Luc. II. Joan. 10.
And you as their natural children / have still the same self judgment
concerning his faithful folowers. They that rebuke your vicyouse living
must neades be heretyques / and that must your doctors prove when ye have no
scripturs to do yt. Doctors when the scripturs fail.
Than said he to them all. To judge you as ye be / we need no farther go than
your own propre acts. Where do ye find in all Gods law / that ye should
thus sit in judgment of any Christen man / or yet sentens any other manne
unto death as ye do here daily? No ground have ye in all the scripturs so
lordelye to take yt upon ye / but in Annas and in Cayphas which sat thus upon
Christ and upon his Apostels after his ascencyon. folowers of Cayphas.
Of them only have ye taken yt to judge Christ's members / as ye do / and
neither of Peter nor Johan.

O most blind beasts.
Than said some of the lawers. yes forsooth sir for Christ judged Judas.

The lord Cobham said. No / Christ judged him not. But he judged himself /
and thereupon went forth and so ded hang himself. But in deed Christ said woe
unto him for that couetuouse act of his / as he does yet still unto many of
you. Geraldus Cambrensis did. 1. cap. 17.
For sens the venyme was shed into ye church / ye never followed Christ
neither yet have ye stand in the perfeccyon of Gods law.

Than asked him the Archebysshop / what he meant by that venyme?

The lord Cobham said / your possessions and lordeshyppes. Ranulphus
Cestrensis in Po^ychro. li. 4. cap. 26.
For than cried an angel in the air (as your own chronycles mencyoneth) woe
/ woe / woe / this day is venyme shed into ye church of God. Before that time
all the Bysshoppes of Rome were martyrs in a manner. And sens that time we read
of very few. But in deed sens that same time one has put down an other one
has poysened an other / one has cursed an other / and one has slain an
other / and done much more myschefe besides / as all the chronycles tells.
Antithesis of Christ and the Pope.
And let all men consydre well this. That Christ was meke and merciful. The
Pope is proud and a tyrant Christ was poor and forgave. The Pope is rich
and a most cruel manslayer / as his daily acts does prove him. Rome is the
very nest of Antichrist. Rome is antichrists nest
And out of that nest comes all his disciples. Of whom Prelates / Prestes /
and Monks are the body / and these pylde friars are the ^ayle which covers
his most filthy part.

Than said the prior of the fryre Anguilynes. ^lac sir / why do ye say so?
That is vncharytablye spoken.

And the lord Cobham said. Not only is yt my saying / but also the Prophet
Esayes / long before my time. Esa. 9. Antichrists tail
The Prophet (says he) which preaches lies / is the tail behind. As you
friars and monks be like Pharysees dyuyded in your outward aparell and
vsages / so make ye dyuysyon among the people. And thus you with soche other /
are the very natural members of Antichrist.

Than said he unto them all. Christ says in his Gospel. Vvo to you Scribes
and Pharysees hypocrytes. Fo^^e close up the kyngedom of heaven before men.
Mat. 23.
Nether enter ye in your selves / nor yet suffer any other that would enter
into yt. But ye stop up the ways thereunto with your own tradicyons / and
therefore are ye the howsholde of Antichrist. The relygyon of Bysshoppes.
ye will not permytt Gods veryte to have passage / nor yet to be taught of his
true mynysters / fearing to have your wickedness reproved. But by soche
vain flatterers as uphold ye in your myscheues / ye suffer the common people
most myserablye to be seduced.

Than said the Archebysshop. A wise Prelate.
By our lady sir there shall no soche preach within my dyocese (and God
will) nor yet in my iurisdiccyon (if I may know yt) as either makes dyuysyon
or yet dyssensyon among the poor commons.

The lord Cobham said. Both Christ and his Apostles were accused of sedycyon
making / yet were they most peceable men. Luc. 25. Joan. 16. Danie. 12. Mat.
24.
Both Daniel and Christ prophesied / that soche a troublouse time should come /
as has not been yet sens the worlds beginning. And this prophecye is partlye
fulfilled in your days and doings. For many have ye slain alredye / and
more will ye slay here after if God fulfill not his promise. Prophecye.
Christ says also / if those days of yours were not shortened / scarslye
should any flesh be saved. Prophecye. Prestes.
Therefore look for yt iustlye / for God will shorten your days. Moreover
though Prestes Deacons
and Deacons for preaching of Gods word and for mynystrynge the sacraments
with prouysyon for the poor / be grounded in Gods law / yet have these other
sects no manner of ground thereof / so far as I have read.

Mark this workynge of satan
Than a doctor of law called mastre Johan hemp / plucked out of his bosom a
copye of that byll which they had before sent him into the tower / by ye
Archebysshoppes counsel / thinking thereby to make shorter work with him. For
they were so amassed with his answers (not all unlike to them which dysputed
with Steven) that they knew Act. 6.
not well how to occupye ye time / their wits and sophistrye (as God would) so
failed them that day.

My lord Cobham (says this doctor) we must breuelye know your mind
concerning these.iiii. points here following. The first article.
The first of them is this. And than he read upon the byll. The faith and the
determynacyon of holy church / towchynge the blessed sacrament of the aultre
/ is this. That after the sacramental words be ones spoken by a Pressed in his
mass / the materyall bread that was before bread / is turned into Christ's
very body. And ye materyall wine / that was before wine / is turned into
Christ's very blood. O beastlye beggerye.
And so there remains in the sacrament of the aultre from thens forth no
materyall bread nor materyall wine / which were there before the sacramental
words were spoken. Sir believe ye not this?

The lord Cobham said. O Christian knight.
This is not my believe. But my faith is (as I said to you before) that in the
worshypfull sacrament of the aultre is very Christ's body in form of bread.

Than said the Archebysshop. Sir Johan / ye must say otherwise.

The lord Cobham said. His constauncy.
Nay that I shall not / if God be upon my side (as I trust he is) but that
there is Christ's body in form of bread / as the common believe is*

Than read the Doctor again. The second point is this. The second article.
Holy church has determined / that every Christen manne living here bodylye
upon earth / ought to be shryuen to a Pressed ordained by the church / if he
may come to him. Sir what say ye to this?

The lord Cobham answered and said. A dyseased or sore wounded manne had need
to have a sure wise surgeon and a true / Confession of sin to God only.
knowing both the ground and the danger of the same. Most necessary were yt
therefore / to be first shryuen unto God / which only knows our dyseases and
can help us. I deny not in this the going to a Pressed / if he be a man of
good life and learning. For the laws of God are to be required of the pressed
which is godly learned. Mala. ^. Prestes.
But if he be an ydyote or a man of vicyouse living that is my curate / I
ought rather to flee from him than to seek unto him. For sonner might I catch
ill of him that is naught / than any goodness toward my soul health.

The.iii. article.
Than read the doctor again. The third point is this. Christ ordained saynct
Peter the Apostle / to be his vycar here in earth / whose see is ye church of
Rome. And he granted that the same power which he gave unto Peter / should
succeed to all Peter's successors which we call now Popes of Rome. By whose
special power in churches partycular be ordained Prelates / as Archebyshoppes
/ Persons / Curates / and other degrees more. Antichrists kyngedome.
Unto whom Christen men ought to obey after the laws of the church of
Rome. This is the determynacyon of holy Church. Sir believe ye not this?

To this he answered and said. Who is next unto Peter.
He that follows Peter most nyghest in pure living / is next unto him in
succession. But your lordelye order estemeth not greatly the lowlye behauer
of poor Peter / what so ever ye prate of him. Neither care ye greatly for the
humble manners of them that succeeded him* till the time of Syluestre / which for
the more part were martyrs / as I told ye before. No succession here.
ye can let all their good condycyo^s go by you / and not hurt your selves
with them at all. All the world knows this well enough by you / and yet ye
can make boast of Peter.

With that / one of the other doctors axed him. Doctor devil.
Than what do ye say of the Pope?

The lord Cobham answered. As I said before. Antichrists body
He and you together makes whole the great Antichrist. Of whom he is the great
head / you Bysshoppes / Prestes / Prelates / and monks are the body / and the
beggynge friars are the tail / for they cover the fylthynesse of you both /
with their subtyle sophistrye. Never will I in conscience obey any of you all
/ till I se you with Peter follow Christ in co^uersacyon.

The.iiii. article.
Than read the doctor again. The forth point is this. Holy church has
determined that yt is merytoryouse to a Christen manne to go on pilgrimage to
holy places. And there specyallye to worship holy relyques and images of
saynctes / Apostles / Martyrs / Confessors / and all other saynctes besides
approved by the church of Rome. Abhomynable knaves.
Sir what say ye to this?

Whereunto he answered. I owe them no service by any commandment of God /
and therefore I mind not to seek them for your couetuousnesse. It were best ye
swept them fair from copwebbes and dust / and so laid them up for catchynge
of scathe. Or else to burye them fair in ye ground / as ye do other aged
people which are Gods images. What is to be done with images
It is a wonderful thing that saints now being dead / should become so
couetuouse and nedye / and thereupon so bytterlye beg / which all their life
time hated all couetuousnesse and beggynge But this I say unto you / and I
would all the world should mark yt. Saints are couetouse beggars.
That with your shryues and ydols / your feigned absolucyons and pardons / ye
draw unto you the substance / welthe / and chief pleasure of all Christen
realms.

Why sir (said one of the clerks) will ye not worship good images? A whelpe
of satan.


What worship should I give unto them? said the lord Cobham?

Than said fryre Palmer unto him. Hypocresye for his part.
Sir ye will worship ye cross of Christ / that he dyed upon?

Where is yt / said the lord Cobham?

The fryre said. I put ye the case sir / that yet were here even now before you?

The lord Cobham answered. Idyotysh beggerye.
This is a great wise manne / to put me an ernest questyon of a thing / and yet
he his self knows not were the thing self is. yet ones again ask I you /
what worship I should do unto yt?

A clarke said unto him. Soche worship as Paul speaks of / and that is this.
Gal. 6.
God forbydde that I should joy but only in the cross of Jesus Christ.

Than said the lord Cobham / and spredde his arms a broad. A christen knight.
This is a very cross / yea / and so much better than your cross of wode /
in that yt was created of God. yet will not I seek to have yt worshypped.

Than said the Bishop of London. A brntysh Bishop.
Sir ye wot well that he dyed on a materyall cross.

The lord Cobham said. yea / and I wot also that our salvation came not in
by that materyall cross / but alone by him / which dyed thereupon. A very manne
of God.
And well I wot that holy saynct Paul reioysed in non other cross / but in
Christ's passion and death only / and in his own sufferynges of like
persecucyon with him for the same self veryte that he had suffered for before.

An other clarke yet asked him. Will ye than do non honor to the holy
cross? O deuyls incarnate


He answered him* yes / if he were mine I would say him up honestlye / and se
unto him that he should take no more scathes a brood / nor be robbed of his
goods / as he is now a days.

Than said the Archebysshop unto him: Slaundered with ye truth.
Sir Johan / ye have spoken here many wonderful words to the slaunderouse
rebuke of all the whole spiritualte / geuynge a greaty^^ example unto the
common sort here / to have us in the more dysdayne. The serpent shows his
nature.
Much time have we spent here abought you / and all in vain so far as I can
se. Well / we must be now at this short point with you / for the day passes
away / ye must either submytt your self to the ordinance of holy church /
or else throw your self (no remedy) into most deep danger. Se to yt in time
/ for anon yt will be else to late.

The lord Cobham said: Non offense done.
I know not to what purpose I should otherwise submytme. Much more have you
offended me than ever I offended you / in thus troublynge me before this
multitude.

Than said the Archebysshop again unto him. A woluish offer of ge^tylnesse.
We ones again require you to remember your self well / and to have non
other opinion in these matters than the universal faith and believe of the
holy Church of Rome is. And so like an obedyent child to return to ye unity
of your mother. Se to yt (I say in time / for yet ye may have remedy /
where as anon yt will be to late

The lord Cobham said expreslye before them all. O con^^aunt Christyane.
I will non otherwise believe in these points / than I have told ye hereafore.
Do with me what ye will.

Fynallye than the Archebysshop said Well than I se non other / Abhomynable
thieves and mourtherers.
but we must neades do the law / we must proceed forth to the sentence
diffynytyue / and both judge ye and condemn ye for an heretyque.

And with that the Archebysshop stood up / and read there a byll of his
condemnacyon / all the clergy and layte auaylynge their bonettes. And this was
thereof the tenor.

The diffynytyue sentence of his condemnacyon.
IN De^nomine / Amen. Nos Thomas permissione diuina Cantuariensis ecclesie

heresye and upon diverse artycles / whereupon sir Johan Oldecastell knight and
lord Cobham / after a dilygent inquysycyon made for the same / was detected /

accused / and presented before us in our last conuocacyon of all our whole
clergy of our province of Caunterburye / holden in the cathedral church of
Paul's at london. At the lawful denouncement and request of our universal
clergy in the said conuocacyon / we proceeded against him according to the law
(God to witness) with all the fauer possible. And following Christ's example
in all that we might / (which wills not the death of a sinner / but rather
that he be converted and live) we took upon us to correct him / Ezec. 18. Ezec.
33.
and sought all other ways possible to bring him again to the churches unity
/ declarynge unto him what the holy and universal church of Rome has said /
holden / determined / and taught in that behalf. The wolf would apere
charytable.
And though we found him in the catholyque faith far wide and so styffnecked
that he would not confess his error / nor pourge himself / nor yet repent
him thereof. We yet pyteynge him of fatherlye compassyon / and inteyrlye
desyerynge the health of his soul / appointed him a competent time of
delyberacyon / to se if he would repent and seek to be reformed. Se / if they
show not themselves.
And sens we have found him worse and worse. Considering therefore that he is
incorrygyble / we are driven to the very extremyte of the law / and with
great heaviness of heart we now proceed to the fynall publycacyon of the
sentence diffynytyue against him.

Idyotes / knaves / and b^astes.
Than brought he forth an other byll contaynynge the said sentence / and that he
read also in his Bauger Latyne. Christi nomine inuocato / ipsum^z solumpre
oculie habentes. Quia peracta inactitata / and so forth. Which I have also
translated into English that me^ne may understand yt:

Ex magno processu Thome Arundeli.
Christ we take unto witness / that nothing else we seek in this our whole
enterprise / but his only glory. For as much as we have found by diverse
acts done / brought forth / and exhybyted / by sordrye euydences / signs /
and tokens / and also by many most manifest proves / the said sir Johan
Oldecastell knight and lord Cobham / not only an euydent heretyque in his

has so hardened his heart that he will in no case attend unto the voice of
his pastor. Neither will he be assured by straight admonyshmentes / nor yet b^

A copye of this writing sent Thomas Arundell the Archebysshop of Cau^terburye
after ward from Maydeston the.x. day of Octobre within the same year of our
Lord a.M.cccc. and.xiii. unto Richard Clyfforde the Bishop of London / which
thus begins / Thomas permissione diuina etc.

The said Richard Clyfforde sent an other copye thereof / enclosed within his
own letters / unto Robert Mascall a Carmelyte fryre which was than Bishop of
Herforde in Vvalis / Richard Clyfforde
written from Hadham the.xxiii. day of Octobre in the same year / and the
beginnynge thereof is this. Reverend in Christo pater etc.

The said Robert Mascall directed an other copye thereof from London the xxvii.
day of Nouembre in the same year / Robert Mascall
enclosed in his own co^missyon also / unto his Archedeacons and Deanes in
Herfforde and Shrewesburye. And this is thereof the beginning. Venerabilibus
and discretis viris etc. In like manner ded the other Bysshoppes within their
dyoceses.

After that the Archebysshop had thus read the byll of his condempnacyon with
most extremyte before the whole multitude / the lord Cobha^ said, Ex vtroque
exemplari.
with a most cherefull countenance. Though ye judge my body which is but a
wretched thing / Mat. 10. Job. 1.
yet am I certain and sure that ye can do no harm to my soul / no more than
could Satan upon the soul of Job. Mat. 10. Job. 1.
He that created that / will of his infynyte mercy and promise save yt / I have
therein no manner of doubt. And as concerning these artycles before rehearsed / A
worthy warryour.
I will stand to them eue^ to the very death by the grace of my eternal God.

And therewith he turned him unto ye people / casting his hands a brood and
saying with a very loud voice. Good Christen people / for Gods love bewele
ware of these me^ne. Christenlye warned. Mat. 15.
For they will else begyle you and lead you blyndelynges into hell with
themselves. For Christ says playnelye unto you. If one blind manne leads an
other / they are like both to fall into the dytche.

After this he fell down there upon his knees / and thus before them all
prayed for his enemies / holding up both his hands and his eyes toward
heaven / and saying: He prays for his enemies.
Lord God eternal / I besyche the for thy great mercyes sake to forgive my
persuers / if yt be thy blyssed will. And than he was delivered to sir Robert
Morleye / and so led forth again to the tower of London. And thus was there
an end of that days work.

Ex vetusto exemplari Londinensiu^.
While the lord Cobham was thus in the tower / he sent out preuylye unto his
fryndes. And they at his ^esyre wrote this little byll here following / causynge
yt to be set up in diverse quarters of London / that the people should not
believe the slanders and lies that his enemies the Bysshoppes servants and
Prestes had made on him a broad. Enemies
And this was the lettre.

For as much as sir Johan Oldecastell knight and lord Cobham / A testimonyall
made by his fryndes.
is untruly convicted and inprosoned / falselye reported and slaundered among
ye common people by his adversaries / that he should otherwise both feel and
speak of the sacraments of the church / and specyallye of the blessed
sacrament of the aultre / than was written in the confession of his believe /
which was indented and taken to the clergy / and so set up in diverse open
places in the cite of London. To stop lyenge lyppes.
known be yt here to all the world / that he never sens varyed in any point
therfro / A rehersall of his believe.
but this is playnelye his believe / that all the sacraments of the church be
profitable and expedyent also to all them that shall be saved / taking them
after the intent that Christ and his true church has ordained. Forthermore he
believes that in the blessed sacrament of the aultre is ve^^lye and truly
Christ's body in form of bread.

After this the Bysshoppes and Prestes were in much obloquye both of the
nobylyte and commo^s / The clergy in hate of the people.
partlye for that they had so cruellye handeled the good lord Cobham / and
partlye again because his opinion (as they thought at that time) was perfyght
concerning the sacrament. As they feared this to grow to forther
inconuenyence toward them both ways / they drew their heads together and
at the last consented to use an other practyse somewhat contrary to that they
had done before. A practyse of false prestes.


They caused yt by and by to be blown a broad by their feed servants /
fryndes / and hablynge sir Iohanes / that the said lord Cobham was become^ a
good manne / and had lowlye submytted him self in all things unto holy
church utterly changynge his opinion concerning the sacrament. These are
there common fears.
And thereupon they counterfeted an abiuracyon in his name / that the people
should take no hold of that opinion by any thing they had heard of him
before / and to stand so in the more awe of them considering him so great a man / and by them subdued.

This is the abiuracyon (say they) of sir Johan Oldecastell knight / sometime
the lord Cobham.

The cruel complaynt of the clergy / and tyrannouse act thereupon made
Never came this abiuracyon to the hands of the lord Cobham / neither was yt
compyled of them for that purpose / but only therewith to bleare the eyes of
the unlearned multitude. The devil has not more ways to myschefe.
And when they perfeyued that polycye would not help / but made more and more
against them / than sought they out an otherfalse practyse. Ex statut^
parliamenti regis Henrici.v.
They went unto the king with a most greuouse complaynt / like as they ded
before in his fathers time / that in every quarter of ye realm by reason of
Vvycleues opinyo^s and the said lord Cobham / were wonderful contencyons /
rumors / tumultes / vprours / confederacyons / dyssencyons / diuysyons /
dyfferences / dyscordes / harms / slanders / scysmes / sec^es / sedycyons /
perturbacyons / parels / unlawful assemblyes / varyau^ces / stryfes /
fyghtynges / rebellyouse ruffelynges / and daily insurreccyons. The clamoure
of papists.
The church they sayd^ was hated. The dyocesanes were not obeyed. The
ordynaryes were not regarded. The spiritual officers / as Suffraganes /
Archedeacons / chauncellers / doctors / commyssaryes / offycyals / deanes /
lawers / serybes / and sommeners were every where despised. The laws and
lybertees of holy church were trodden under foot. The Christen faith was
ruyuouslye decayed. They cry a^^ce for their bellyes.
Gods service was lawhed to scorn. The spiritual iurisdiccyon / auctoryte /
honor / power / polycye / laws / rytes / ceremonies / curses / keys /
censures / and canonycall sanccyons of the church / were had in an vttre
contemt. So that all in a manner was come to naught.

And the cause of this was / Christ always too bleth the^.
that the heretyques and lol^ars of Vvycleues opinion / were suffered to
preach abroad so boldelye / to gather conuentycles unto them / to hepe scoles
in me^nys houses / to make books / compyle treatyses / and write balettes / to
teach pryuatlye in angles and corners / as in wodes / feldes / meadows /
pastors / groves / and in caves of the ground. An old practyse of theyrs yet
used.
This would be (they said) a destruccyon to the commen welthe / a subuersyon to
the land / and an vttre decay of the kings estate ryall / if remedy were
not sought in time. And this was their polycye to cople the kings auctoryte
with that they had done in their former counsel of craft / and so to make yt
thereby the strongar. For they perseyued themselves very far to weak else /
to follow against their enemies that they had so largelye enterprysed. A
parliament at Leycestre.
Upon this complaynt / the kydge immedyatlye called a Parliament at Leycestre.
It might not in those days be holden at Vvestmynstre for the great fauer that
the lord Cobham had both in London and abought the cite. yet were they
deceived. That they doubted most lyghted there sonest upon them.

Robertus Fabianus in chrom^^is. Walden. in fasciculo. Fabianus i^ chronicis
A byll was put in there again by ye commons against their co^tynuall wasting
of the temporaltees / like as yt had been twyse before by procurement of the
said lord Cobham both in ye days of king Richard the second / anno 1395.
and also of king Henrye the.iiii. annadomini. 1410 whereupon was grown all
this malice before specyfyed) but this was than workemanlye defeated by an other
propre practyse of theyrs. They put the king in remembrance to claim his
right in France / and granted him thereunto a dyme with other great subsydye
of money. A practyse. (...)
Thus were Christ's people betrayed every way / and their lives bought and
sold by these most cruel thieves. For in the said Parliament the king made
this most blasphemouse and cruel act / to be as a law for ever. Walden. ad
Martinum papa^ li. 2. ca. 46 and in sydone. Polydorus.
That what so ever they were that should read the scripturs in the mother
tongue which was than called Vvycleues lernyng) they should forfet land /
cattle / body / life / and goods from their heirs for ever / and so be
condemned for heretyques to God / enemies to the crown / and most errande
trayters to the land.

Besides this yt was enacted that never a sanyctwarye nor pryuyleged ground
within the realm should hold them / though they were still permytted both to
thieves and mourtherers. Christ has less fauer tha^ thieves.
And if in case they would not give over / or were after their pardon relapsed
/ they should suffer death in two manner of kinds. That is. They should first be
hanged for treason against the king / and than be burned for heresye against
God and yet neither of both committed. Never tyrau^t more cruel.
The beginning of that act is this. Pro eo quod magni rumores etc. Anon after
was yt proclaimed through out the realm / and than had the Bysshoppes / Prestes
/ Monks / and friars a world somewhat to their minds. For than were many
taken in diverse quarters / and suffered most cruel death. Walden. ad Marti
number papa^ li. 2. ca. 50. De sacramentalibus ca. 53.
And many fled out of the land into Germanye / Boheme / France / Spain /
Portyngale / and into the welde of Scotland / Vvalys / and Irelande / workynge
there many marueyls against their false kyngedome to long to write. In the
Christmas following was sir Roger Acton knight / mastre Johan Brown esquyre /
sir Johan Beuerlaye a letned preacher / and diverse other more attached for
quarellynge with certain prestes / and so inpresoned. Walden. Fabianus. Io.
mayor Polydorus.
For all men at that time could not pacyentlye suffer their blasphemouse
bragges.

The complaynt was made unto the king of them / that they had made a great
assemblye in saynet Gyles field at London / A greatly.
purposynge the destruccyon of the land and the subuersyon of the common
welthe. As the king was thus infourmed / Walden. ad Martinum / and in prologo
de sacrame^tis.
he erected a banner (says Walden) with a cross thereupon (as ye Pope does
commonly by his Legates / when he pretends to war against the Turk) and
with a great nombre of men entered the same field / where as he found no
soche company. yet was the complaynt judged true / because the Bysshoppes had
spoken yt at the infourmacyon of their Prestes. What Thomas Walden was.
All this has Thomas Walden in diverse of his works / which was at the same
time a Vvhyght or Carmelyte fryre and the kings confessor / and partlye yt is
towched both by Robert Fabyane and by Polydorus / Vergilius in their English
chronycles / but not in all points ^yghtlye as is to be s^ane in the preface
asore. In the mean season sir Johan Oldecastell the lord Cobham escaped out
of the tower of London in the night and so fled into Vvalys / where as he
continued more than.iiii. years after. Fabianus. Polydorus* inchronicis


Some writers have thought this escape to come by the said sir Roger Acton and
other gentylmenne in dyspleasure of the Prestes / A conjecture of writers.
and that to be the chief occasyon of their deaths / which might well be / but
Walden does not so vttre yt / which reigned the same self time. Johan mayor.
lib. vi. cap. ix. history Scotorum.
In Ianuarye next following was the before named sir Roger Acton / mastre Johan
Brown / sir Johan Beuerlaye / and.xxxvi. more (of whom ye more part were
gentle men of birth) convicted of heresye by the Bishops / and condemned
of treason by the temporalte / and according to the act / were first hanged
and than brent in the said saynct Gyles field. In the same year also was one
Johan Claydon a skynner and one Richard Turmyne a baker both hanged and brent
in Smyth field by that virtuous act / Robertus Fabianus in chronicis.
besides that was done in all other quarters of England / which was no small
nombre if yt were now througlye known.

The latter enpresonynge and death of the lord Cobham.
IN the year of our Lord a. M. CCCC. and.xv. dyed Thomas Arundell / Thomas
Arundell dyed.
which had been Archebysshop of Caunterburye more than xxxii. years / to the
great destruccyon of Christen believe. yet dyed not his prodygyouse tyranny
with him / but suceeded with his office in Henrye Chycheleye and in a great
sort more of that spyghtfull spiritualte. The lord Cobham is betrayed
For their malice was not yet satled against the good lord Cobham. But they
confedered with the lord Powys (which was at that time a great governor in
Vvalys) fedynge him with lordelye gifts and promyses to accomplysshe their
desire. He at the last thus monyed with Judas / Mat. 26.
and outwardlye pretendynge him great amyte and favor / most cowardlye and
wretchedlye took him / and in conclusyon so sent him up to London / where as he
remained a month or two inprysoned again in the Tower. And after long
process they condemned him again of heresye and treason by force of the before
named a (...) renderynge thanks* unto God / Condemned is gods true servant.
that he had so appointed him to suffer for his names sake

And upon the day appointed he was brought out of the Tower with his arms
bound behind him / He is led forth to his death
having a very cherefull countenance. Than was he laid upon an hardle / as
though he had been a most heynouse traitor to the crown / and so drawn forth
into saynct Gyles field / where as they had set up a new pair of Galowes. As
he was comen to the place of execucyon / and was taken from the hardle / he
fell downed enoughtlye upon his knees / desyerynge almyghtye God to forgive his
enemies. He prays for his enemies.
Than stood he up and beheld the multitude / exhorting them in most godly
manner to follow the laws of God written in the scripturs / and in any wise to
be ware of soche teachers as they se contrary to Christ in their conuersacyn
and living / with many other special counsels. Than was he hanged up there
by the myddle in cheanes of iron / and so consumed a live in the fire /
praysynge the name of God so long as his life lasted. Br^t wa^ he in cheanes.
In the end he commended his soul into the hands of God / and so departed
hens most Christenlye / his body resolved into ashes.

What ye people and prestes ded.
And this was done in the year of our Lord a. M.cccc. and.xviii. which was the
sixth year of the regne of king Henrye the fyft / the people there present
showing great dolor. How the Prestes that time fared / blasphemed / and
cursed / requyrynge the people not to pray for him but to judge him damned in
hell / for that he departed not in the obedience of their Pope / yt were to
long to write. Not ye Popes servant but Christ's.
This terryble kind of death with galowes / cheanes / and fire / apereth not
very precyouse in the eyes of men that be carnal / no more than ded the
death of Christ when he was hanged up among thieves. The ryghtuouse seems to
dye (says the wise manne) in the sight of them which are unwise / Joan. 1^.
Sapie^. 5.
and their end is taken for very destruccyon. Ungodly foles thinks their
lives very madness / and their passage hens without all honor. But though
they suffer pain before men (says he) yet is their expectacyon full of
immortalyte. Sapie^. 5.
They are accounted for the children of God / Joan. 1. ^apie^. 3.
and have their just porcyon among the faynctes As golden in the furnace does
God try his electes / and as a most plesaunt brent offering receives he them
to rest.

The more hard the passage be / the more gloryouse shall they apere in the
lattre resurreccyon. Heb. 11. Romans 8.
Not that the affliccyons of this life are worthy of soche a glory / but that
yt is Gods heavenly pleasure so to reward them. Esa. 55.
Never are the judgments and ways of men like unto the judgments and
ways of God / but contrary evermore unless they be taught of him. Hiere. 32.
Dan. 12.
In the latter time (says the Lord unto Daniel) shall many be chosen /
proved / and puryfyed by frye / yet shall the ungodly live wyckedlye still and
have no understanding that is of faith. Apoc. 14.
By an angel from heaven was Johan ernestlye commanded to write / that blessed
are ye dead which hence departs in ye Lord. Right dear (says David) in the
sight of God is the death of his true servants. Psalm. 115.
Thus rests this valeaunt Christen knight sir Johan Oldecastell under the
aultre of God (which is Jesus Christ) among that godly company which in the
kyngedome of pacye^ce / suffered great tribulacyon with ye death of their bodies
for his faithful word and testimonye / Apoc. 6. Apoc. 1. Apoc. 7.
abiding there with them the fulfyllynge of their whole nombre / and the full
restauricyon of his electes. Apoc. 20.
The which he grant in effect at his time appointed / which is one God

The conclusyon.
An other cause of his death
Besides the cause rehearsed before in the preface / concerning the dreadful
death of this most Christen knight sir Johan Old castle the lord Cobham /
this is also rekened for one. In the end of the first book / which he put up
into the Parliament how se against the abusyons of the clergy^ / Against ye

in the year of our Lord a. M.CCC. xcv. (which was also the.xviii. year of

but was law head to scorn of the Bysshoppes / than were these verses copyed
out by diverse men / and set upon their wyndowes / gates / and doors / which
were than known for obstynate hypocrytes and fleshlye lyuers / which made ye
prelates mad. And this is ye great insurreccyon that Walden complayneth of
unto Pope Martyne the fyft / and after him Polydotus the Popes collectour /
with other papists more / wherein never a one manne was hurt. The insurreccyo^
complained of.
I would maruele much more of the doubleness of Thomas Walden being than
the kings confessor if I ded not know the unshamefast nature of that lyenge
generacyon. Ad Martinum papa^ Et in prefatio^e. 4. libri co^tra Vvicleuistas.
In his first Epistle unto Pope Martyue / and in the first Preface of his
fourth book contra Vvicleuistas / he says that sir Johan Old castle with a
great nombre of heretyques conspyred against king Henrye the fyft in the first
year of his regne / and that he offered him for every monk / chanon / fryre
/ and Popyshe Prestes head within his realm / a gold noble. And clean
contrary unto this / he testyfyeth in his book called Fasciculus zizaniorum
Vvicleui / Fasciculus zizanioru^ Vvicleui.
that he was the same self time / year / month / weke / and day a presoner
within the Tower of London. How well these two wrytynges agree / I report me.

But thus commonly are innocent men lied upon among these blasphemouse
bessygoddes. Liars.
But he that is essencyallye true of himself / Johan. 8.
has promised at one time or other to clear his true servant / not by lies
and fables / but by his own pure word. No secret (says he) is so close /
but ones shall be opened / neither is any thing so hid / that shall not at
the last be known clerelye. Mat. 10. Luc. 12.
Thus has sir Johan Oldecastell a tryumphau^t victory over his enemies by the
veryte which he defended / Cobham ouercometh.
all contrary to the blind worlds expectacyon / and they have a foul
overthrow being proved manifest murderers / blind beasts / hypocrytes /
and liars by the same. Psalm. 33. Luc. 1.
Soche a sweet Lord is God always to those that be his true servants /
blessed be his holy name therefore. Confer the causes of this godly ma^nys
death with the points that Thomas Becket dyed for and other Popish martyrs
besides / and ye shall find them far dyfferent and unlike. Stephanus Langto^
in vita Thome li. 3. ca. 19.
Thomas Becket was slain at Caunterburye / in his Prelates aparell / in the
head church / before the high aultre / among relygyouse Monks and Prestes /
and in the holy time of Christmas / by his own seeking. And all this is
gloryouse unto worldly judgments.

Sir Johan Oldecastell was brent in cheanes / Walden. Io. mayor Fabianus.
at London in saynct Gyles field / under the galowes / among the say people /
and upon the profane workynge day / at the Bysshoppes procurement. And all
this is vngloryouse / yea and very despyscable unto those worldly eyes / what
though Jesus Christ his mastre before him were handeled after a very like sort.
Jesus Christ.
For he was crucyfyed at Jerusalem / without the cite and without the holy
synagoge / a cursed out of church / Heb. 1^. Johan. 9.
among the profane multitude / in the myddest of thieves / in ye place where
as thieves were co^monlye hanged / Mat. 27. Ioha. ^9. Act. 3.
and not upon the feastfull day but before yt / by the Bysshoppes procureme^t
also. Now let us consydre the causes of both their deaths / and try them both
by the manifest scripturs of the Gospel / which of them should seem most to the
glory of men. Herybertus Hoscham in vita Thome.
Thomas Becket dyed upon his own seeking only / for maynteynynge the wanton
lybertees and superfluouse possessions of the Romyshe church here within
England / which are both forbidden of Christ and also condemned by the same
scripturs. He that forsakes not all that he has / Luc. 14.
(says he) can not be my disciple. And when a contencyon befell among the
Apostles for the superyoryte / Luc. 23. 1. Pet. 5.
he said also unto them. The kings of the world have the worlds domynyon
with all pomp and rytches belonging to the same. But you shall not so

Sir Johan Oldecastell dyed at the importune suit of the clergy / Wherefore
the forde Cobha^ dyed.
for calling upon a Christen reformacyon in that Romyshe church of theyrs /
and for manfullye standing by the faithful testymonyes of Jesus / as all the
before said process declares. And this is both allowed in the Gospel / and
also required of every Christen beleuer. He that confesses me / and my word
before men (says Christ) him will I confess for mine before my eternal
father. Mat. 10. Mar. 8. ^uc. 9. Luc. 12.
And he that shall deny me and my veryte before men / him will I also deny
for mine before my everlasting father which is in heaven.

Thomas Becket in the time of his death commended himself to the patrones of
his church (which were two gylded images of saynct Sauer and saynct Marye) and
the cause of his church unto saynct Denis / Ben^dic* de Burgo Petri. Ioannes
capgraue. Stephanus Langton. li. 3. ca. 18.
and had no more but his Prestes crown cut of (which is the Popes lyuerye
mark) even by the very shauynge as his storye mencyoneth.

Sir Johan Oldecastell in the time of his death commended his soul with David
/ Christ / and Steven into the hands of God the eternal father / and his
cause to the ryght^ull judgment of his son Jesus Christ / How the lord
Cobham ham dyed
with desire of merciful forgiveness concerning his enemies / as became a
faithful Christyane / and had his whole body consumed in the fire. Now pluck
from your eyes the corrupted spectacles of carnal or popyshe judgments /
and do upon them that clear sight which ye have by the sprete of Christ. No
popisshe martyr is Cobham.
And that faythfullye done / tell me which of these two seems rather to be the
martyr of Christ / and which the Popes martyr? The ways of God (says Esaye)
are not ye ways of men. Esa. 55.
But so far as the heavens are above the vile earth / so far do his
judgments excede theyrs. Luc. 16.
That wc seems high and gloryouse unto men (says Christ) is very
abhominacyon before God. By this may ye se that the precyouse spowse or
immaculate church of Christ / is no gorgyouslye painted gentle woman nor
gloryouse glytterynge madane / Psalm. 44.
but all hydden and unknown to the worldly infydels which dysdayneth to seek
her in the scripturs.

Nothing is precyouse unto them / that shyneth not unto the eye. A most fyt
membre for Christ's mystycall body / is he that suffers with the head thereof.
Who is a right me^lye of Christ.
As this good sir Johan Oldecastell ded / when he was with Christ examyned of
the proud Bysshoppes / scorned of the Prestes / The tyra^nye of bisshops and
prestes.
dysdayned of the world / ill reported / mocked / hated / re^yled / acursed /
and so committed unto the lay judgment to be condemned by them unto most
shameful and cruel death. yea / so extremely malycyouse was that spyghtfull
spiritualte against him / that they would not suffer his body to be buried in
their great cite or holy Church (which is spirituallye called Sodoma and
Egyptus) to make the prophecye of saynct Iohans Apocalypse truly to be verefyed
upon him / Apoc. 11.
and to prove him Christ's membre all together. They both resolved his body
into ashes / and also made the river to carrye them away / like as they ded
also with the bones of Johan Vvycleue / De sacramentalibus ca. 09. (1137
Fasciculus zizantoru^
least any thing thereof should remain / because they would also show them
selves like in tyra^nye to Iulianus apostata that so used the body of holy
Johan Baptist before them. I should make a comparyson betwixt this blessed martyr
of Christ sir Johan Oldecastell / and Peter of Myllayne with other of the Popes
martyrs / The Popes martyrs.
which dyed for the Popes power / pardone / pylgrymages / ear confession / and
other popyshe matters more establysshed in the general counsel of laterane /
but yt would axe to much time.

And as concerning the kind of his co^temtuouse death or martyrdom. More
vile was not his hanging under ye galowes in an iron cheane / than was the
hanging of his lord Jesus Christ upon the cross in the time of his death.
Nor than was the hanging of Peter / Ioha^. 19. Petrus Equilinus Ioannes textor.
Andrew / and Phylyp his holy Apostles / Bishop Symeon / Dorotheus /
Gorgonius / Alexander / Epipodius / Claudius / Asterius / Menon / Nemesius /
Nestor / Agricola / Iulia / zoc the wife of Nicostratus with many other holy
martyr ^ more. More odyouse was not his burning in the fire / Bre^t was he
with Christ's martyr.
than was the cruel burning of Barnabas the Apostle / Polycarpus ye good
Bishop of Smyrna / Amancius / Agathon / Tyburciu^ / Getulius / Symphronins /
Sosthenes / Victor / Dioscorus / Eulogius / Fructuosus / Castus / Aemilius /
Fideneius / Hero / ^yreneus / Aphra / Hyplaria / Apolonia / Anastasia / and
many hondrethes more. Psalm. 21. Amos. 4.
When this strong witness of the lord was among the fat bulls of Basan
/ and most cruellye assaulted of them / he was throughlye assertayned in his
conscience for that conflyct of faith / to taste his eternal goodness in the
lasting land of the living. Ioha^. 12. Psalm. 26.


yea / soche time as he was reproved of his enemies and forsaken of his fryndes
/ Psalm. 30.
in manner of a broken vessel / he took a strong stomach unto him as ded the
mighty Machadees / and thought thus in this mind. 2. Match 7
That though those ungracious tyrauntes should put him unto death / yet would
the eternal king (which is both resurreccyon and life) raise him up again in
the resurreccyon of life everlasting / among them that has dyed for his pure
laws. Ioha^. 11. Ioha^. 6. Apoc. 20.
All redye has he raised his fame (which lay long dead) by the living
sprete of his Gospel / for that he was a mynystre thereof. The Gospel
vnsaynteth Becket.
Which is a most euydent token that he will here after with his other
mystycall members / raise him up in perfyght glory. When the Gospel lay
dead / gloryouse Thomas Becket was a saynct / and Johan Oldecastell a forgotten
heretyque. But now that the light thereof shyneth / we are like to se yt far
otherwise. For proud Becket has alredye hydden his face / and poor
Oldecastell begins now to apere very notable. The Gospel canon^seth Cobha^.
Not all vnryghtlye ded saynct Augustyn speak yt and other old doctors
besides that many were worshypped here in earth for saynctes / whose wretched
sowles are greuouslye crucyate in hell.

Soche time as our most worthy sovereign king Henrye the.viii. now living /
after the most godly example of king Josias vysyted the temples of his realm
/ 4. Reg. 23.2. (...).
he perseyued the synnefull shryne of this Becket to be unto his people a most
pernycyouse evil / and therefore in the word of the lord he utterly among
other destroyed yt. Prestes suffered upon amendment.
If he had upon that and soche other abhomynable shrynes brent those
ydolatrouse prestes which were (and are yet) their chief maynteners / he had
fulfilled that godly historye through out. But that which was not than
performed in hope of their amendment / may by chance light upon them
herafter / when no gentle warning will seem to be regarded. I doubt yt not at
all / but his / most noble dyscressyon perseyueth much more that wicked
generacyon of the Popes norryshynge up / They dau^ce but in a net.
which always has maynteyned (and yet do) soche manifest errors / than he
ever in his life yet uttered. The lord conserve his grace.
The eternal father reward his grace for that clear light of health which we
poor creaturs have received at his only hand under God / though yt be not
all without the greuouse ponnyshment of our bodies. By the process which we
have before here uttered of sir Johan Oldecastell / ye may euydentlye se / that
great is the treasure which the Lord has laid up for the behoue of the^ that
has trusted in him. Psalm. 30. (...) 4. Sap^^. 5.
Vvherwith now he makes du^me / the lyenge lyppes of them that dysdaynouslye
reported the ryghtuouse / to the honor and praise of his most gloryouse name.
AMEN.

Thus ends the brefe chronycle concerning the Examynacyon and death of ye
blessed martyr of Christ sir Johan Oldecastell the lord Cobham / not canonysed
of the Pope / but in the precyouse blood of his Lord Jesus Christ. Collected
by Johan Bale / and imprynted anno Domini. 1544. and. vi. die Augusti.
Prophecyes of Ioachim Abbas.
IN the latter days shall apere a law of lyberte. The Gospel of the
kyngedome of Christ shall be taught / and the church shall be pourged as
wheat is from chafe and tares

More clerelye shall men than be learned. The kyngedome of the flesh shall be
done away / and these things shall be fulfilled toward the end of the
world.

The holy ghost shall more perfyghtlye exercise his domynyon in converting
peoples by the preachers of the la^ter time / than by the Apostles.

The church of Rome is the fleshlye synagoge of satan.

The church of Rome shall be destroyed in the third state / as the synagoge
of the Jews was destroyed in the second state. And a spiritual church shall
from thens forth succeed / to the end of the world.

The departing of the Greeks from the church of Rome / was godly. For yt was
ordained of God / and wrought by the holy ghost.
