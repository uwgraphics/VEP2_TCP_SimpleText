A QVIP FOR AN VPstart Courtier: Or, A quaint dispute betvveen Velvet breeches
and Clothbreeches. Wherein is plainly set down the disorders in all Estates
and Trades.



LONDON Imprinted by John Wolf, and are to be sold at his shop at Poules
chain. 1592.

(...) that all Northamtonshire reports how you are a father of the poor, a
supporter of ancient Hospitality, an enemy to Pride, and to be short, a
maintayner of Clothbreeches (I mean of the old and worthy customs of the
Gentilitie and yeomanrie of England. Induced by these reasons, I humbly present
this Pamphlet to your Worship, only craving you will accept it as courtiously
as I present it dutifully, and then I have the end of my desire and so resting
in hope of your favorable acceptance, I humbly take my leave.

Your dutiful adopted son, Robert Green.

To the Gentlemen Readers health.
GEntle Gentlemen, I hope Clothbreeches shall find your gentle Censors of this
homely Apology of his ancient prerogatives sith though he speaks against
Velvet breeches which you were, yet he twits not the weed but the vice, not
the apparel when it is worthily worn, but the unworthy person that wears it,
who sprang of a Peasant will use any sinister means to clime to preferment,
being then so proud as the foppe forgets like the Ass that a mule was his
father. For ancient Gentility and yeomanrie, Cloth breeches attempteth this
quarrel, and hopes of their favor: for vpstarts he is half careless, and the
more, because he knows whatsoever some think privately, they will be no
public carpers: least by kicking where they are touched, they bewray their gald
backs to the world, and by starting up to find fault, prove themselves
vpstarts and fools. So then poor Cloth breeches sets down his rest on the
courtesy of gentle gentlemen and bold Yeomen, that they will suffer him to
take no wrong. But suppose the worst, that he should be fround at, and that
such occupations as he has upon conscience discarded from the Jury, should
commence an action of unkindness against him, heel prove it not to hold plea,
because all the debate was but a dream. And so hoping all men will merrily
take it, he stands solemnly leaning on his pike staff, till he here what
you conceive of him for being so peremtorie. If well, he swears to crack his
hose at the knees to quite your courtesy. If hardly, he has vowed that
whatsoever he dreams never to blabbe it again, and so he wishes me humbly to
bid you farewell.

A quip for an vpstart Courtier.
IT was just at that time when she Cuckeulds querister began to bewray April
Gentlemen with his never changed notes, that I damped with a melancholy humor,
went into the fields to clear up my wits with the fresh air: where
solitary seeking to sollace my self I fell in a dream, and in that drowsy
slumber, I wandered into a vale all tapistred with sweet and choice flowers,
there grew many simples whose virtues taught me to be subtle and to think
nature by her weeds warnd men to be wary and by their secret properties to
check wanton and sensual imperfections. Amongst the rest, there was the
yellow daffadil, a flower fit for gelous Dottrels, who through the beauty of
their honest wives grew suspicious, Daffadil for dotrels that are gelous.
and so prove themselves in the end cuckhold Heretics, there budded out the
checkerd (Paunsie) or party colored Hearts ease an herb sieldome seen, either
of such men as are wedded to shrews or of such women as have hasty husbands:
yet there it grew, and as I stepped to gather it, it slipped from me like Tantalus
fruit that fails their master. At last, woondring at this secret quality, I
learned that none can wear it, be they kings, but such as desire no more then
they are borne to, nor have their wishes above their fortunes. Fennel women's
weed.
Upon a bank bororing by grew women's weeds, Fenell I mean for flatterers, fit
generally for that Sex, sith while they are maidens, they wish wantonly: while
they are wives they will wilfully, while they are widows, they would
willingly: and yet all these proud desires, are but close dissemblings. Near
adioining sprouted out the Courtiers comfort, Time for wise men if they would
Time: An herb that many stumble on and yet ouerslip, whose rank savor and
thick leaves, have this peculiar property, to make a snaile if she taste of
the sap as swift as a swallow, yet joined with this prejudice, that if she
clime too hastily, she falls too suddenly. Methought I saw diverse young
courtiers tread upon it with high disdain, but as they past away, an Adder
lurking there bit them by the heels that they wept: and then I might perceive
certain clownes in clowted shoone gather it, and eat of it with greediness:
which no sooner was sunk into their mawes, but they were metamorphosed, and
looked as proudly though pesants, as if they had been borne to be princes
companions.

Amongst the rest of these changelings whom the taste of time had thus altered,
there was some that lifted their heads so hie, as if they had been bred to
look no lower then stars, they thought Noli altum sapere was rather the saying
of a fool, then the censure of a Philosopher, and therefore stretch themselves
on their tiptoes, as if they had been a kindred to the lord Tiptost, and began
to disdain their equals, scorn their inferiors, Lord Tiptost a proud and
insolent Earl raised by Edwar. 4.
and even their betters, forgetting now that time had taught them to say
mass, how before they had played the Clarks part to say Amen to the priest.
Tush, then they were not so little as Gentlemen, and their own conceit was
the Herald to blason their descent, from an old house, whose great
grandfathers would have bin glad of a new cottage to hide their heads in. Yet
as the peacock wrapped in the pride of his beauteous feathers is known to be but
a dunghill bird by his foul feet: so though the high looks and costly suits
argue to the eyes of the world they were Caualiers of great worship, yet the
churlish illiberalitie of their minds, bewraid their fathers were not above
three pounds in the kings books at a subsidye, but as these vpstart
changelings went strouting like Philopo Limarchides the beagart in Plautus,
they looked so proudlye at the same, that they stumbled on a bed of Rue, that
grew at the bottom of the bank where the Time was planted, which fall upon
the deaw of so bitter an herb, taught them that such proud peacocks as over
hastily out run their fortunes at last to speedily, fall to repentance, and
yet some of them smild and said Rue was called Her be grace, which though they
scorned in their youth, they might wear in their age, and it was never too
late to say Miserere. As thus I stood musing at this time borne broad, they
vanished away like Cadmus copesmates, that sprang up of vipers teeth, so that
casting mine eye aside after them, I saw where a crew of all estates were
gathering flowers, what kind they were of I knew not, but precious, I gest
them in that they plucked them with greedienes, so that I drew toward them, to
be partaker of their profits, coming nearer, I might see the weed they so
wrangled for, was a little dapper flower, like a ground Hunmsuckle, called
thrift, Thrift the herb that al men seek after.
praised generally of all, but practiced for distillation, but of few amongst
the crew that seemed covetous of this herb, there was a troop of old
graibeards in velvet, satin, and worsted iackets, that stooped as nimbly to
pluck it up by the roots, as if their joints had been suppeled in the oil
of misers skins, they spared no labor and pains to get and gather, Old
churles provide oftentimes for unthrifty children.
and what they got they gave to certain young boys and girls that stood
behind them, with their skirtes and laps open to receive it: among whom some
scattered it as fast as their fathers gathered it, wasting and spoiling it at
their pleasure which their fathers got with labor.

I thought them to be some Herbalists or some Apothecaries that had employed
such pains to extract some rare quintessence out of this flower, but one
standing by told me they were Cormorants and vserers, that gathered it to fill
their cofers with, and whereto, quoth I, is it precious? what is the virtue of
it? marry, quoth he, to qualify the heat of insatiable minds that like the
serpent Dipsas never drinks enough till they are so full they burst, why
then said I the Devil burst them all, and with that I fell into a great
laughter, Young nouices, cou^t^^^s, and vpsta^^s scorn th^^^t.

Whores consume men's th^^^t.


to see certain Italianate Cantes, humorous Caualiers, youthful Gentlemen, and
Inonerati gagliardi, that scornefully plucked of it, and wore it a while as if
they were weary of it, and at last left it as to base a flower to put in their
nosegaies. Others that seemed Homini di grandi stina by their looks and their
walks gathered earnestly and did pocket it up as if they meant to keep it
carefully, but as they were carrieng it away, there met them a troop of nice
wantons, fair women that like to Lamiae, had faces like Angels, eyes like
stars, breasts like the golden front in the Hesperides, but from the middle
downwardes their shapes like serpents. These with Syrenlike allurement so
entised these quaint squires, that they bestowed al their flowers upon them for
favors, they themselves walking home by beggars bush for a penance. Amongst
this crew were Lawyers, Lawiers get all.

Poets nothing.


and they gathered the Devil and all, but poor Poets were thrust back and
could not be suffered to have one handful to put amongst their withered
garlands of baies, to make them glorious. But Hob and John of the country they
stepped in churlishly, in their high startvps, and gathered whole sackefuls:
insomuch they wore beesoms of Thrift in their Hats like forehorsses, or the
lusty Gallants in a Morris dance: Pesants hu^t for profit.
seeing the true thus to wrangle for so paltry a weed, I went alone to take one
of all the other fragrant flowers that diapred this valley thereby I saw the
Batchelers buttons, whose virtue is to make wanton maidens weep when they have
worn it fortye weeks under their Aprons for a favor.

Next them grew the dissembling daisie, to warn such light of love wenches
not to trust every fair promise that such amorous Batchelers make them, but
sweet smells breed bitter repentance. Hard by grew the true lovers primrose,
Men should be faithful women courteous.
whose kind savor wishes men to be faithful and women courteous. Along in
a border grew maidenhair fit for modest maidens to behold, and immodest to
blush at, because it praises the one for their natural Tresses, and
condemns the other for their beastly and counterfeit Periwigs, there was the
gentle gilliflower that wives should wear if they were not too froward; and
loiall Lauendar, but that was full of Cuckoe-spits, to show that women's light
thoughts make their husbands heavy heads: there were sweet Lillies Gods
plenty, which showed fair Virgins need not weep for wooers, and store of
balm which could cure strange wounds, only not that wound which women receive
when they loose their maidenheads, Virginity lost is incurable.
for no herb has virtue enough to scrape out that blot and therefore it is
the greater blemish. Infinite were the flowers beside that beautified the valie,
that to know their names and operations I needed some curious herball, but I
pass them over as needless, since the vision of their virtues was but a
dream, and therefore I wish no man to hold any discourse herein authentical,
yet thus much I must say for a parting blow, that at the lower end of the dale
I saw a great many of women using high words to their husbands, some striving
for the breeches, other to have the last word, some fretting they could not
find a rush in a straw, others striving whether it were wool or hair the got
bare: questioning with one that I met why these women were so choleric, he
like a skoffing fellow pointed to a bush of nettles, I not willing to be
satisfied with signs, asked him what he meant thereby, Mary (quoth he) all
these women that you hear brawling frowning and skolding thus, have severally
pist on this bush of nettles, and the virtue of them is to force a woman that
waters the^ to be as peevish for a whole day and as waspishe as if she had been
stung in the browe with a hornet. Well, I smilde at this, and left the company
to seek further, when in the twinkling of an eye I was left alone, the vallie
cleared of all company, and I a distressed man desirous to wander out of that
solitary place to seek good consorts and boon companions to pass away the
day withal. As thus I walked forward, looking up the hill I was driven half
into a mase with the imagination of a strange wonder which fell out thus: Me
thought I saw an uncouth headless thing come pacing down the hill stepping so
proudly with such a geometrical grace, as if some artificial bragant had
resolved to measure the world with his paces: I could not descry it to be a
man, although it had motion, for that it wanted a body, yet seeing legs and
hose I supposed it to be some monster nourisht up in those deserts, at last as
it drue more nigh unto me, I might perceive that it was a very passing
costlye pair of Velvet breeches, whose pains being made of the cheifest
Neapolitane stuff, was drawn out with the best Spanish satin, and marvelous
curiouslye over whipte with Gold twist, interseamed with knottes of Pearl,
the Neatherstocke was of the purest Granado Silk, no cost was spared to set
out these costlye breeches, who had gyrte unto them a Rapyer and Dagger gylt,
point pendaunt, as quayntlye as if some curious Florentine had trickte them up
to square it up and down the streets before his Mistress. As these Breeches
were exceeding sumptuous to the eye, so were they passing pompous in their
gestures, for they strowted up and down the Vallye as proudelye as though they
had there appointed to act some desperate combat.

Blame me not if I were driven into a muse with this most monstrous sight to
see in that place such a strange headless Courtier ieatting up and down like
the Usher of a Fense-schoole about to play his Pryse, when I deem never in
any age such a wonderful obiecte fortunee unto any man before. Well, the
greater dumpe this Noueltye drove me into, the more desire I had to see what
euente would follow: whereupon looking about to see if that any more company
would come, I might perceive from the top of the other hill an other pair of
Breeches more soberlye marching, and with a softer pace, as if they were not
too hasty, and yet would keep promise nevertheless at the place appointed.
As soon as they were come into the vallie, I saw they were a plain pair of
Cloth breeches, without either welt or guard, straight to the thigh, of white
kersie, without a sloppe, the nether stock of the same, sewed to above the
knee, and only seamed with a little couentrie blew, such as in Diebus illis
our great grandfathers wore, when neighborhood and hospitality had banished
Pride out of England. Nor were these plain breeches weaponlesse, for they had a
good sower bat with a pike in the end, able to lay on load enough, if the heart
were answerable to the weapon, and upon this staff pitched down upon the
ground, Clothbreeches stood solemnly leaning, as if they meant not to start,
but to annswer to the vtteraunce whatsoever in that place might be objected.
Looking upon these two, (might perceive by the pride of the one, and homely
resolution of the other, that this their meeting would grow to some dangerous
conflict, and therefore to prevent the fatal issue of such a pretended
quarrel, I stepped between them both, when Velvet breeches greeted Cloth
breeches with this salutation. Proud and insolent pesant, how dare thou
without leave or low reverence press into the place w^ether I am come for to
disport my self? Art thou not a friend? thy high presumption should savor
to displeasure, and so force me draw my rapyer, which is never unsheathed but
it turns into the scabberd with a triumph of mine enemies blood: bold bayard
auaunt, beard me not to my face, for this time I pardon thy folly, and grant
thy legs leave to carry away thy life. Clothbreeches nothing amassed at this
brauado, bending his staff as if he meant (if he were wronged) to bestow his
benison, with a skorneful kind of smiling made this smooth reply: Mary gyp
goodman vpstart, who made your father a gentleman, so^te fire makes sweet
malt, the curstest Cow has the shortest horns, and a brawling curre of all
bites the least, alas good sir, are you so fine that no man may be your fellow,
I pray you what difference is between you and me but in the cost and the
making, though you be never so richly daubde with goulde and powdered with
Pearl, yet you are but a case for the buttockes, and a cover for the basest
part of a man's body no more than I, the greatest pre-eminence is in the
garnishing and thereof you are proud, but come to the true use we were
appointed to, my honor is more than thine, for I belong to the old ancient
yeomanrie, yea and gentilitie, the fathers, and thou to a company of proud and
unmannerly vpstarts the sons At this, Veluet-breeches stormd and said, Why
thou beggars brat descended from the reuersion of base poverty, is thy
insolence so great to make comparison with me, whose difference is as great as
the brightness of the sun and the slender light of a candle: I (poor
snake) am sproong from the ancient Romans, borne in Italy the mistress of the
world for chivalry, calde into England from my native home (where I was famous)
to honor your courtiers and young gentlmen here in England with my
countenance, where I am holden in high regard, that I can press into the
presence when thou poor soul shall with cap and knee beg leave of the
Porter to enter, and I sit and dine with the Nobility, when thou art feign to
wait for the reuersion of the alms basket: I am admitted boldly to tell my
tale, when thou art feign to sue by means of supplication, The more is the
pity.
and that and thou to so little regarded, that most commonly it never comes to
the Princes hand, but dies imprisoned in some obscure pocket: Since then there
is such difference between our estates, cease to urge my patience with thy
insolent presumption. Clothbreeches as brief as he was proud, swore by the
pike of his staff, that his choplogicke was not worth a pin, and that he
would turn his own weapon into his bosom thus, Why signior Glorioso (quoth
he) though I have not such glosing phrases to trick out my speeches withal as
you, yet I will come over your fallowes with this balde rhethoricke: I pray you
Mounsier Malapart are you therefore my superior because you are taken up with
Gentlemen, and I with the yeomanrie? Does true virtue consist in riches* or
humanity in wealth? is ancient honor tied to outward bravery? or is not
rather true Nobility, a mind excellently qualified with rare virtues? I will
teach thee a lesson worth the hearing, proud princkocks, how Gentilitie first
sprung up, I will not forget the old wives logic, When Adam delvd and Eve
span, who was then a Gentleman? but I tell thee after the general floode that
there was no more men upon the earth but Noe and his three sons, and that
Cham had wickedly discovered his fathers secrets then grew the division of
estates thus: The church was figured in Sem, Gentilitie in Iapheth, and labor
and drudgerie in Cham: Sem being chaste and holy, Soldiers and Scholars
Gentlemen
Iapheth learned and valiant, Cham churlish and servile, yet did not the curse
extend so far upon Cham, nor the blessing upon Iapheth, but if the one altered
his nature, and became either endued with learning or valor he might be a
gentleman, or if the other degenerated from his ancient virtues he might be
heald a pesaunt, whereupon Noe inferred that gentilitie grew not only by
propagation of nature, but by perfection of qualities: Then is your worship
wide that beast of your worth for your gold and pearl, since Cucullus non
facit Monachum, nor a Velvet slop make a slouen a gentleman: And whereas thou
say thou were borne in Italy, and called hither by our courtiers, him may we
curse that brought thee first into England, for thou camst not alone but
accompanied with a multitude of abominable vices, hanging to thy bumbast
nothing but infectious abuses, as vainglory, selfeloue, sodomic, and strange
poysonings, wherewith thou have infected this glorious Island, yea insolent
bragant, thou have defiled thine own neast, and fatal was the day of thy
birth, for since the time of thy hatching in Italy, as then famous for chiualry
and learning, the imperial state through thy pride has decayed, and thou have
like the young Pelican peckt at thy mothers breast with thy presumption,
causing them to lose that their forefathers with true honor conquered, so have
thou been the ruin of the Roman Empire, and now fatally art thou come into
England to attempt here the like subversion. Whereas thou do boast that I
am little regarded where thou art highly accounted of, and have sufferance to
press into the presence, when I am for my simpleness shut out of door, I
grant thy allegation in part, but not in whole, for men of high wisdom and
honor measure not men by the outward show of bravery, but by the inward worth
and honesty, and so though I am disdained of a few ouerweening fools, I am
valued as well as thy self with the wise In that thou say thou can speak
when I sue by supplication, I grant it, but the tale thou telst is to the ruin
of the poor, for coming into high favor with an impudent face, what farm is
there expirde, whose least thou do not beg? what forfeite of penal
statutes? what concealed lands can ouerslip thee? yea rather than thy bravery
should fail beg powling pence for the very smoke that coms out of poor
men's chimnies, shamste thou not vplandish vpstart to hear me discourse thy
imperfections, get thee home again into thy own country, and let me as I was
wont live famous in my native home in England where I was borne and bred, yea
and bearded Caesar thy countriman til he compast the conquest by treason. The
right and title in this country base brat ( quoth velvet breeches) now authority
favors me, I am admitted viceroy, and I will make thee do me homage, and
confess that thou hold thy being and residence in my land from the gracious
favor of my sufferance and with that he laid hold on the hilts of his rapier,
and cloth breeches betook him to his staff, when I stepping betwixt them
parted them thus, Why what mean ye, will you decide your controversy by blows,
when you may debate it by reason, The true bad^e of a justice.
this is a land of peace governed by true iusticiaries and honorable
magistrates, where you shall have equity without partiality, and therefore listen
to me and discuss the matter by law, your quarrel is, whether of you are most
ancient and most worthy, you sir, boast of your country and parentage, he of
his native birth in England, you claim all, he would have but his own, both
plead an absolute title of residence in this country, then must the course
between you be trespass or disseison of frank tenement, you Velvet breeches in
that you claim the first title you shall be plaintiff, and plead a trespass
of disseison done you by Cloth breeches, so shall it be brought to a jury,
and tried by a verdict of twelve or four and twenty. Tush, tush, quoth Velvet
breeches, I neither like to be plaintiff, nor yet allow of a jury, for they
may be partial, and so condemn me in mine own action, for the country swains
can not value of my worth nor can mine honors come within the compass of
their base wits, because I am a stranger in this land, and but here lately
arrived, they will hold me as an vpstart and so lightly esteem of my
worthiness, and for my adversary is their countriman and less chargeable, he
shall have the law mittigated, if a jury of hinds or pesants should be
impaneled, if ancient gentlemen yeomen or plain ministers should be of the
quest. I were sure to lose the day because they loath me, in that I have
persuaded so many landlordes for the maintenance of my bravery to raise their
rents. You seek a knot in a rush ( quoth I) you need not doubt of that, for whom
you distrust and think not indifferent, him you upon a cause manifested,
challenge from your jury. If your law allow such large favor (quoth Velvet
breeches) I am content my title be tried by a jury, and therefore let mine
adversary plead me Null tort, Null disseison. Cloth breeches was content with
this, and so they both agreed I should be judge and iuror in this
controversy, whereupon I wished them to say for themselves what they could,
that I might discourse to the jury what reasons they alleged of their Titles:
then Velvet breeches began thus. I cannot but grieve that I should be thus
outfast with a carters weed only fit for husbandry, seeing that I am the
original of all honorable endeavors: to what end does yooth bestow their wits
on law physic, or Theology, were it not the end they aim at is the wearing
of me and winning of preferment, Yet this posie cannot make a man rich.
Honor norisheth Art, and for the regard of dignity do learned menstriue to
exceed in their faculty. Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad indos,

What drives the merchants to seek foreign marts, to venture their goods and
hazard their lives? not, if still the end of their travel were a pair of cloth
breeches, no velvet costly attire, curious and quaint apparel is the spur that
pricks them forward to attempt such danger. Does not the Soldiers fight to
be brave, the Lawyer study to countenance himself with cost, the artificer
take pains only for my sake that wearing me he may brag it amongst the best,
what credit carries he now adays that goes pinde up in a Cloth breech, who
will keep him company that thinks well of himself, unless he use the
simple slave to make clean his shoone, the worlds are changde and men are
grown to more wit, and their minds to aspyre after more honorable thoughts,
they were Dunces in diebus illis, they had not the true use of gentility, and
therefore they lived meanly and died obscurely, but now men's capacities are
refined, time has set a new edge on gentleme^s humors and they show them as
they should be, not like gluttons as their fathers did in chines of beef and
alms to the pore, but in veluets, sattins, cloth of gold, pearl, yea perle
lace, which scarce Caligula wore on his birth day, and to this honorable humor
have I brought these gentlemen since I came from Italy: what is the end of
service to a man but to countenance himself and credit his master with brave
suits, then scuruie tapsters and ostlers fex populi fill pots and rub
horsseheeles, to pranke themselves with my glory, alas were it not to wear me,
why would so many apply themselves to extraordinary idleness? Beside, I make
fools be reuerenst, and thought wise amongst the common sort, I am a severe
sensor to such as offend the law, provided there be a penalty annexed that
may bring in some profit, yea by me the cheifest part of the realm is
governed, and therefore I refer my title to the verdit of any men of
judgment. To this, mildly Clothbreeches answered thus.

As I have had always that honest humor in me to measure al estates by their
virtues, not by their apparel, so did I never grudge at the bravery of any
whom birth, time, place, or dignity made worthy of such costly ornaments,
but if by the favor of their Prince and their own deserts they merited them,
I held both lawful and commendable to answer their degrees in apparel,
correspondent unto their dignities, I am not so precise directly to inueigh
against the use of velvet, either in breeches or other suits, nor will I have
men go like John Baptist, in coats of Camels hair. Let Princes have their
Diadems, and Caesar have what is due to Caesar, let Noblemen go as their birth
requires, and Gentlemen as they are borne or bear office, I speak in mine
own defense, for the ancient Gentility and yeomanrie of England, and inueigh
against none, but such malapert vpstart as raised up from the Plough, or
advanced for their Italian devises, or for their witless wealth, covet in
bravery to match, nay to exceed the greatest Noblemen in this land.

But leaving this digression mou^sier velvet breeches, again to the
particulars of your fond allegation. Whereas you affirm your self to be both
original and final end of learning, alas proud princox, you perch a bow to
hie, did all the Philosophers beat their brains, and busy their wits to
wear velvet breeches. Why both at that time thou were unknown, yea unborn,
and all excess in apparel had in high contempt, and now in these days all
men of worth, are taught by reading, that excess is a great sin: that pride
is the first step to the downfall of shame. They study with Tullie, that they
may seem borne for their contreys as well as for themselves. The Divine to
preach the Gospel: the Lawyer to reform wrongs and maintain justice: the
Physician to discover the secrets of Gods wonders, by working strange cures: to
be brief, the end of all being, as to know God, And not as your worship
good master velvet breeches wrests to creep into acquaintance.

I will not deny, but there be as fantastical fools as your self, that
perhaps are pufte up with such presuming thoughts, and ambitiously aim to
trick themselves in your worships masking suits: but while such climb for
great honors, they often fall to great shames. It may be thereupon you bring
in Honos alit Arts, but I guess your maistership never tried what true honor
meant, that trusse it up within the compass of a pair of velvet breeches, and
place it in the arrogancy of heart, no, no: say honor is idolatry, for they
make fools of themselves, and idols of their carcases: but he that valueth
honor so, shall reed a lecture out of Apuleius golden Ass, to learn him
more wit. But now sir by your leave, a blow with your next argument, which is,
that merchants hazard their goods and lives to be acquainted with your
maistership. Indeed you are awrie for wise men frequent marts for profit not
for pride, unless it be some, that by wearing of velvet breeches and apparel
too high for their calling, have proud bankerouts in their youth, and have
been glad in their age to desire my acquaintance, and to trusse up their
tails in homespunne russet: whereas thou do object the valor of hardy
soldiers to grow for the desire of brave apparel. It Is false, and I know if
any were present, they would prove upon thy bones thou were a lier: for their
countries good, their princes service, the defense of their friends, the hope
of favor is the final end of their resolutions: esteeming not only them but
the worlds glory, fickle, transitory, and inconstant. Shall I fetch from thine
own country, weapons to wound thy self withal. What say thou to
Cycuratus, was he not called to be Dictator from the Plough, and after many
victories, what did he iet up and down the court in costlye garments and
velvet breeches? No, he despised dignity, contemned vaineglory and pride, and
returned again to his quiet contented life in the country. How much did Caius
Fabritius value their Numa pompilius, Sceuola, Scipio, Epamino^das, Aristides,
they held themselves worms meat, and counted pride vanity, and yet thou art
not ashamed to say, thou art the end of soldiors worthy honor. I tell thee
saucy skipiack, it was a good and a blessed time here in Englane, when K.
Stephen wore a pair of cloth breeches of a Noble a pair, and thought them
passing costlye, then did he count Westminster hall to little to be his dieng
chamber and his alms was not bare bones, in stead of broken meat but lusty
chines of beef fell into the poor man's basket. Then charity flourished in
the court, and young Courtyers strove to exceed one another in virtue, not in
bravery: they rode not with fans to ward their faces from the wind, but with
Burgans to resist the stroke of a Battleax, they could then better exhort a
soldior to armor then court a lady with amorets, they caused the trumpet to
sound them points of wars, not Poets to write them wanton Eligies of love:
they soght after honorable fame, but hunted not after fading honor: which
distinction by the way take thus. There be some that seek honor, and some are
sought after by honor. Such vpstarts as fetch their pedigree from their
fathers ancient leather apron, and creep into the court with great humility,
ready at the first Basciare li predi dila vostra signo ria having gotten the
countenance of some Nobleman, will strait be a kindred to Cadwaller, and swear
his great gra^dmother was one of the Burgesses of the parliament house, will at
last steal by degrees into some credit by their double diligence, and then
wind some worshipful place as far as a hungry sow can smell a sir reverence,
and then with all their friends seek day and night with coin and countenance
til they have got it. Others there be whom honor it self seeks, and such be
they whom virtue does frame fit for that purpose, that rising by high deserts,
as learning, or valor, merit more then either they look for, or their prince
has any ease conveniently to bestow on them. Such honor seeks, and they with a
blushing conscience intertein him, be they never so high in favor, yet they
beg no office, as the shamlesse vpstart does, that has a hungry eye to spy
out, an impudent face to sue, and a flattring tongue to entreat for some void
place of worship, which little belonged to them if the prince intended to
bestow offices for virtue not favor. Other M. velvet breeches there be of your
crew, that pinche their bellies to polish their backs, that keep their mawes
empty, to fill their purses that have no show of gentility but a velvet slop,
who by polling or selling of land that their father left, will bestow all to
buy an office about the court that they may be worshipful, extorting from the
poor, to raise up their money that the base deceiving companions have laid
out to have an office of some countenance and credit, wherein they may of me
better than themselves, be termed by the name of worship. The last whom
virtue pleads for, and neither silver, gold, friends* nor favor aduanceth,
be men of great worth, such as are thought of worship, and unwillingly
entertain hir^ rather vouchsafing proffered honor for their countries cause,
then for any proud opinion of hoped for preferment.

Blessed are such lands, whose officers are so placed, and where the Prince
promoteth not for coin or countenance, but for his worthy deserving virtues.
But leaving this by-talke, methought I heard you say Signior veluetbreeche,
that you were the father of mechanical Arts and handiecrafts were found out to
foster your bravery. In faith good man goosecap, you that are come from the
startvps, and therefore is called an vpstart, quasi start up from clowted
shoone your lips hoong in your light, when you brought forth this Lodgike: for
I hope there is none so simple, but knows that handicraftes and occupation
grew for necessity not pride: that men's inventions waxed sharp to profit the
common wealth, not to pranke up themselves in brauerye. I pray you when
Tubalcane invented tempring of metals had he velvet breeches to wear? In
sadness, where was your worship when his brother found out the accordes and
discords of Music hidden in hell, and not yet thought on by the Devil, to
cast forth as a bait to bring many proud fools to ruin?

Indeed I cannot deny, but your worship has brought in deceit as a iourneyman
into al companies, and made that a subtle craft, which while I was holden in
esteem was but a simple mystery: now every trade has his sleightes, to
slubber up his work to the eye, and to make it good to the sale, howsoever
it proves in the wearing. The shoemaker cares not if his shoes hold the
drawing on: the tailor sowes with hot needle and burnt thread. Tushe pride has
banished conscience, and velvet breeches honesty, and every servile drudge must
ruffle in his silks, or else he is not suitable.

The world was not so A principio, for when velvet was worn but in kings
caps, then conscience was not a broom man in Kent street but a Courtier, then
the farmer was content his son should hold the plough, and live as he had
done before: Beggars then feared to aspire, and the higher sorts scornd to
envy. Now every lowt must have his son a Courtnoll, and those dunghill
drudges wax so proud, that they will presume to wear on their feet, what
kings have worn on their heads. A clownes son must be clapped in a velvet
pantophle, and a velvet breech, though the presumptuous ass be drowned in the
Mercers book, and make a convey of al his lands to the usurer for commodities:
yea the fop must go like a gallant for a while, although at last in his age he
beg. But indeed, such young youths when the Broker has blessed them with saint
Needams cross, fall then to privy lifts and cosenages, and when their credit
is utterly cracked, they practice some bad shifte, and so come to a shameful
end.

Lastly, whereas thou say thou art a severe sensour to punish sins, as
austere as Cato to correct vice, of truth I hold thee so in penal statutes
when thou have begged the forfeit of the Prince: but such correction is open
extortion and oppression of the poor, nor can I compare it better M. velvet
breech, then to the Wolf chastising the lamb for disturbing their fountain,
or the Devil casting out Devils, through the power of Belsebub, and thus much
courteous sir I have said, to displaie the follies of mine adversary, and to
show the right of mine own interest. Why then quoth I, if you have both said,
it rests but that we had some to empanell upon a Jury, and then no doubt
but the verdict would soon be given on one side. As thus I was talking to
them, I might see coming down the hill a brave dapper Dicke, quaintly attired
in velvet and Satin, and a cloak of cloth rash, with a Cambricke ruff as
smoothly set, and he as neatly spunged, as if he had been a bridegroom, only
I gest by his pace a far off he should be a Tailor, his head was holden
up so pert, and his legs shackle hamd, as if his knees had been laced to
his thighs with points. Coming more near indeed, I spied a Tailors morris
pike on his breast, a spanish needle, and then I fitted my salutations, not to
his suits but to his trade, and incountred him by a thread bare courtesy, as if
I had not known him, and asked him of what occupation he was? A Tailor, quoth
he, marry then my friend, quoth I, you are the more welcome, for here is a
great quarrel grown betwixt velvet breeches and cloth breeches, for their
prerogative in England: the matter is grown to an issue, there must a Jury be
empanelled, and I would desire and entreat you to be one of the quest.

Not so, quoth Cloth breeches I challenge him. And why quoth I? What reason have
you, does he not make them both? yes, quoth he, but his gains is not alike:
alas, by me he gets small, only he is paid for his workmanship, unless by
misfortune his shieres slip awrye, and then his vales is but a shred of
homespunne cloth: Whereas in making of velvet breeches, where there is required
silk lace, cloth of gold, of silver, and such costly stuff, to welt, guard,
whip, stitch, edge, face, and draw out, that the vales of one velvet breech is
more then twenty pair of mine. I hope there is no Tailor so precise, but he
can play the cook and lick his own fingers: though he look up to Heaven,
yet he can cast large shreds of such rich stuff into hell under his shop
board. Beside he sets down like the clarke of the Check a large bill of
reckonings, which for he keeps long in his pocket he so powders for stinking,
that the yoonge vpstart that needs it, feels it salt in his stomach a month
after. Besides, sir velvet breeches has aduanst him: for whereas in my time he
was counted but goodman Tailor, now he is grown since velvet breeches came in,
to be called a merchant or Gentleman Merchant Tailor, giving arms and the
holy Lamb in his creast, where before he had no other cognizance, but a
plain Spanish needle with a welsh cricket on the top: since then his gains
are so great and his honors so aduanst by velvet breeches, I will not trust
his conscience, nor shall he come upon my Jury.

Indeed you have some reason quoth I, but perhaps the Tailor does this upon
mere devotion to punish pride, and having no other authority nor means,
thinks it best to pinch them by the pursse and make them pay well, as to
ask twice so much silk lace and other stuff as would suffice, and yet to
ouerreach my young master with a bill of reckoning that will make him scratch
where it itcheth not. Herein I hold the Tailor for a necessary member to teach
proud nouices the way to weeping cross: that when they have wasted what their
fathers left them by pride, they may grow sparing and humble, by inferred
poverty: and by this reason, the Tailor plays Gods part: he exalts the poor
and pulls down the proud: For of a wealthy Esquires son, he makes a
thredbare beggar: and of a scornful Tailor, he sets up an vpstart scuruy
Gentleman. Yet seeiing you have made a reasonable challenge to him, the Tailor
shall be none of the quest.

As I bad him stand by, All this was gentlemen's cast apparel.
there was coming along the valley toward us, a square set fellow well
fed, and as briskly apparelled, in a black taffata doublet and a spruce
leather ierken, with Crystal buttons: A cloak facst before with velvet, and a
Couentry cap of the finest wool, his face something Ruby blush, Cherry
cheeked, like a shredde of scarlet or a little darker, like the lees of old
claret wine: a nose autem nose purphled pretiously with pearl and stone, like
a counterfeit work, and between the filthye reumy-cast of his bloudshotten
snowt, there appeared small holes, whereat worms heads peeped as if they meant
by their appearance to preach and show the antientie and antiquity of his house.

This fiery facst churl had upon his fingers as many gol rings, as would
furnish a goldsmiths shop or beseem a pandor of long profession to were,
wondering what companion this would be, I inquiret of what occupation he was:
marry sir quoth he, a Broker, why do you ask, have you any pawnes at my
house? No quoth I, nor by the help of God never will have: but the reason is to
have you upon a Jury. At this word, before I could enter my discourse unto him,
velvet breeches start up, and swore he should be none of the quest, he would
challenge him, and why quoth I, what know you by him? This base churl is one
of the moathes of the Common wealth, he is the spoil of young gentlemen a blood
sucker of the poor, as thirsty as a horse leach that will never leave
drinking while he burst, a knave that has interest in the leases of forty
bawdy houses, a receiver for lifts, and a dishonorable supporter of cutpurses,
to conclude, he was gotten by an Incubus a he Devil, and brought forth by an
over worn refuse, that had spent her youth under the raines of Bowbies Barn.

O monstrous inuectiue, quoth I, what reason have you to be thus bitter against
him? Oh the villain, quoth he, is the Devils factor, sent from hell to torment
young Gentlemen upon earth: he has fetched me over in his time, only in pawnes,
in ten thousand pound in gold. Suppose as Gentlemen through their liberal
minds may want that I need, money: let me come to him with a pawn worth ten
pound, he will not lend upon it above three pound, and he will have a bill of
sale and twelve pence in the pound for every month, so that it comes to
sixteen pence, since the byll must monthly be renewed, and if you break but
your day, set down in the bill of sale, your pawn is lost, as full bought
and sold, you turned out of your goods and he an unconscionable gainer.
Suppose the best, you keep your day, yet paying sixteen pence a month for
twenty shillings, you pay as good for the lone as four score in the hundredth,
is not this monstrous exacting upon Gentlemen. Beside the knave will be
diligently attending and waiting at dicing houses where we be at play, and
there he is ready to lend the looser money upon rings, and chains, apparel
or any other good pawn, but the poor gentleman paies so dear for the
lauender it is laid up in, that if it lie long at a brokers house he seems to
buy his apparel twice: nay this worm eaten wretch has deeper pitfals yet to
trap youth in, for he being acquainted with a young gentleman of fair living,
in issue of good parents or assured possibility, sooths him in his monstrous
expenses and says he carries the mind of a gentleman, promising if he want he
shall not lack for a hundred pound or two, if the gentleman need, then has my
broker an usurer at hand as ill as himself, and he bringes the money, but they
tie the poor soul in such Darbies bands, what with receiving ill commodities
and forfeitures upon the band, that they dub him sir John had-lande before they
leave him, and share like wolves the pore nouices wealth betwixt them as a pray,
he is (sir) to be brief, a bowsie bawdie miser, good for none but himself and
his trugge, a carle that has a filthy carcass without a conscience, a body
of a man wherein an infernal spirit in steed of a soul does inhabit, the
scum of the seven deadly sins, an enemy to all good minds, a deuourer of
young gentlemen, and to conclude my mortal enemy, and therefore admit of my
challenge, and let him be none of the jury. Truly ( quoth Cloth breeches) and I
am willing he should be discarded too, for were not bad brokers (I will not
condemn all) there would be less filching and fewer thieves, for they receive
all is brought them, and buy that for a Crown that is worth twenty shillings,
desire of game blinds their conscience, and they care not how it be come by, so
they buy it cheap. Beside they extorte upon the poor that are enforced
through extreme want to pawn their clothes and household stuff, their pewter
and brass, and if the poor souls that labor hard miss but a day, the base
minded broaker takes the forfeit without remorse or pity, it was not so in
Diebus illis, but thou proud vpstart Velvet breeches have learnd all
Englishmen their villainy, and all to maintain thy bravery: yea, I have
known alate when a poor woman laid a silver thimble that was sent her from
her friends for a token, to pawn for six pence, and the broker made her pay a
halfpeny a week for it, which comes to two shillings a year, for six pence:
since then his conscience is so bad, let him be shuffled out amongst the knaves
for a discarding card, Content, quoth I, and bad the broker stand back, when
there were even at my heels three in a cluster pert youths al, and neatly
tired, I questiond them what they were, and the one said he was a barber, the
other a surgion, the third an Apoticarie. How like you of these ( quoth I) shall
they be of your jury? Of the jury, quoth Clothbreeches, never a one by my
consent, for I challenge them all: your reason quoth I, and then ye shall have my
verdict. Mary ( quoth Clothbreeches) first to the barber he can not be but a
partial man on velvet breeches side, since he gets more by one time dressing of
him, than by ten times dressing of me, I come plain to be polde and to have my
beard cut, and pay him two penc, velvet breeches he sits down in the chair
wrapped in fine clothes, as though the barber were about to make him a
foot-cloth for the vickar of saint fools, then begins he to take his sissars
in his hand and his comb, and so to snap with them as if he meant to give a
warning to all the lice in his nittie locks for to prepare themselves, for the
day of their destruction was at hand, then comes he out with his fustian
eloquence and making a low conge says: Sir will you have your worcester hair cut
after the Italian manner, short and round, and then frounst with the curling
yrons, to make it look like a halfemoone in a mist? or like a Spanyarde long
at the ears, and curled like to the two ends of an old cast periwig, or will
you be Frenchefied with a love lock down to your shoulders, wherein you may
wear your mistress favor? the English cut is base and gentlemen skorne it,
noueltye is dainty, speak the word sir, my sissars are ready to execute your
worships will. His head being once dressed, which requiers in combing and rubbing
some two hours: he coms to the basin, then being curiously washte with no
worse than a camphier ball, he discends as low as his bearde, and asks
whether he please to be shaven or no, whether he will have his peak cut short
and sharp, amiable like an Inamerato or broad pendant like a spade, to be
terrible like a warrior and a Soldado, whether he will have his crates cut low
like a Iuniperbush, or his suberches taken away with a Rasor, if it be his
pleasure to have his appendices primde, or his mustachios fostered to turn
about his ears like the branches of a vine, or cut down to the lip with the
Italian lash, to make him look like a half faced baubie in brass. These
quaint terms Barber you greet master velvet breeches withal, and at every
word a snap with you sissors, and a cring with your knee, whereas when you come
to poor Clothbreeches you either cut his bearde at your own pleasure, or
else in disdain ask him if he will be trimd with Christ's cut, round like the
half of a hollande cheese, mocking both Christ and us: for this your knauerie
my will is you shall be none of the jury. For you master surgion, the statutes
of England exempts you from being of any quest, and beside, alas, I sildome
fall into your hands as being quiet and making no brawles to have wounds, as
swartrutting veluetbreeches does, neither do I frequent whorehouses to catch
the mar-tooles, and so to grow your patient, I know you not, and therefore I
appeal to the statute, you shall have nothing to do with my matter. And for
you M. Apoticarie, alas, I look not once in seven year into your stop,
without it be to buy a peniworth of worm-seed to give my child to drink, or a
little triacle to drive out the measels, or perhaps some dregs and powders to
make my sick horse a drench withal, but for my self, if I be ill at ease, I
take Kitchen physic, I make my wife my Doctor, and my garden my Apoticaries
shop, whereas queasie master velvet breeches cannot have a fart awrye, but he
must have his purgations, pills, and glisters, or euacuate by electuaries, he
must if the least spot of morpue come on his face, have his oil of Tartar, his
Lac virginis, his camphire dissolved in veriuice, to make the fool as fair
forsooth, as if he were to play Maidmarian in a May Game or Moris-daunce,
tush he cannot digest his meat without conserues, nor end his meal without
suckats, nor (shall I speak plainly) please the trug his mistres without he
go to the Apothecaries for Eringion, Oleum formicarum atalarum, and aqua
mirabilis of ten pound a pint, if mast Velvet breeches with drinking these
drugs hap to have a stinking breath, then forsooth the Apoticarie must play the
parfumer to make it sweet, nay what is it about him that he blames not nature
for framing, and forms it anew by art, and in all this who but mounsier the
Apothicarie, therefore good sir (quoth he) seeing you have taken upon you to be
trior for the challenges, let those three as partial companions be packing.
Why ( quoth I) seeing you have yielded such reason of refusal, let them stand
by: presently looking about for more, comes stalking down an aged grave sir in
a black velvet coat and a black cloth gown welted and faced, and after him
as I suppose, four seruingmen, the most ill favored knaves me thought that
ever I saw, one of them had on a buffe leather ierkin all greasy before with
the droppings of bear that fell from his beard, 1. Officer.
and by his side a skeine like a Bruers boung knyfe, and muffled he was in a
cloak turnde over his nose, as though he had been ashamde to show his face.
The second had a belly like a buckingtub, 2. Sumner.
and a thredbare black coat vnbuttond before upon the breast, whereon the map
of drunkenness was drawn, with the bawdie and bowsie excrements that dropped
from his filthy leaking mouth. 3. Jailer.
The third was a long lean old slauering slangrel with a brasil staff in the
one hand, and a whipcord in the other, so pour blind that he had like to have
stumbled upon the company before he saw them. 4. Informer.
The fourth was a fat chuffe with a sower look in a black cloak faced with
taffata, and by his side a great side pouch like a faulkner: for their faces
all four seemed to be brethren, they were so bu^basted with the flocks of
strong bee^e, and lined with the lees of old sack, that they lookte like four
blown bladders painted over with read oake^, or washed over with the suds of
an old stale die. All these, as well the master as the following mates would
have past away, but that I stepped before them and inquired first of the foremost
what he was, Mary quoth he, a Lawyer, then sir quoth I, we have a matter in
controversy that requires counsel, and you are the more welcome, What is
it, quoth he, Mary said I, whether Clothbreeches or veluetbreeches are of more
worth, and which of them has the best title to be resident in England? At this
the lawyer smild, and veluetbreeches stepping forth took acquaintance of him,
and commending his honesty, said there could not be a man of better
indifferency of the jury: when clothbreeches stepping in swore he marvelled he
was not as well as the Surgion exempted by act of parliament from being of any
quest, since as the surgion was without pity, so he was without conscience,
and thereupon inferd his challenge, saying the Lawyer was never friend to
clothbreeches, for when lowliness neighborhood and hospitality lived in
England, Westminster hall was a dining chamber, not a den of controversies,
when the king himself was content to keep his S. Georges day in a plain pair
of Kersie hose, when the duke, earl, lord, knight, gentleman and esquire,
aimed at virtue* not at pride, and wore such breches as was spun in his house,
then the lawier was a simple man, and in the highest degree was but a bare
scriuener, except Judges of the land which took in hand serious matters, as
treasons, murders, felonies, and such capital offenses, but sildom was there
any pleas put in before that proud vpstart velvet breeches, for his
maintaynance invented strange controversies* and since he began to dominier in
England, he has busd such a proud busye covetous and incroching humor into
every man's head, that Lawyers are grown to be one of the chief lims of the
commonwelth, for they do now adays de lana caprina rixare, go to law if a hen
do but scrape in his orcharde, but howsoever right be, might carries away the
verdict: if a poor man sue a gentleman, why he shootes up to the sky, and the
arrowe falls on his own head howsoever the cause go, the weakest is thrust to
the wall, lawiers are troubled with the heat of the liver, which makes the
palms of their hands so hot that they cannot be coold unless they be rubd with
the oil of angels, but the poor man that gives but his bare fee, or perhaps
pleads in forma pauperis, he hunteth for hares with a taber, and gropeth in the
dark to find a needle in a bottle of hay, tush these lawyers have such delatory
and foreign pleas such dormers, such quibs and quiddits, that beggering their
clients they purchase to themselves whole lordships, it booteth not men to
discourse their little conscience, and great extortion, only suffice they be
not so rich as they be bad, and yet they be but too welthy. I inueigh not
against law nor honest lawyers, for there be some well qualified, but against
extorting Ambodexters that wring the poor, and because I know not whether this
be such a one or no, I challenge him not to be of my jury. Why then, quoth I, his
worship may depart, and then I questiond what he in the buff ierkin was, Mary
quoth he, I am a serieant, he had no sooner said so, but velvet breeches leapt
back, and drawing his rapyer, swore he did not only challenge him for his jury,
but also protested if he stird one foot toward him, he would make him eat a
piece of his poinard. And what is the reason quoth I, that there is such mortal
hatred betwixt you and the Serieant? Oh sir, quoth Velvet breeches, search him,
and I warrant you the knave has precept upon precept to arrest me, has worn
his mace smooth, with only clapping it upon my shoulder he has had me under
coram so often, oh the reprobate is the Usurers executioner to bring such
Gentlemen to Limbo as he has overthrown with his base brocage and bad
commodities: and as you see him a fat knave with a foggie face, wherein a cup
of old sack has set a seal, to mark the bowsie drunkard to die of the
dropsy, so his conscience is consumed, and his heart robbed of all remorse and
pity, that for money he will betray his own father, for will a cormorant but
fee him to arrest a young gentleman, the rakehell will be so eager to catch
him, as a dog to take a bear by the ears in Parrish-garden, and when he
has laid hold upon him, he uses him as courteously as a Butchers cur would
do an ox cheek when he is hungry, if he see the gentleman has money in his
purse, then straight with a cap and knee he carries him to the tavern and bids
him send for some of his friends to bale him, but first he covenants to have
some brase of angels for his pains, and besides he calls in for wine as
greedily as if the knaves mother had been broacht against a hogshead when he
was begotten, but suppose the Gentleman wants pence he will either have a pawn
or else dreg him to the counter without respect of manhood or honesty, I
should spend the whole day with displayeng his villainies, therefore breefly let
this suffice, he was never made by the consent of God, but his slouenly carkase
was framd by the devil, of the rotten carrion of a woolfe, and his soul of an
usurers damned ghost turned out of hell into his body to do monstrous
wickedness again upon the earth, so that he shall be none of my jury, neither
shall he come nearer me than the length of my rapyer will suffer him. Indeed
quoth Clothbreeches generally serieants be bad but there be amongst them some
honest men, that will do their duties with lawful favor: for, to say truth,
if serieants were not, how should men come by their debts? marry they are so
cruel in their office, that if they arrest a poor man, they will not suffer
him (if he has not money) to stay a quarter of an hour to talk with his
creditor, although perhaps at the meeting they might take composition, but only
to the counter with him, unless he will lay his pewter, bras, couerlets,
sheets, or such housholdstuf, to them for pawn of payment of some coin for
their staieng: therefore let him depart out of the place, for his room is
better than his company. Well then quoth I, what say you to these three, and with
that I questiond their names, the one said he was a sumner, the other a
jailer, and the third an informer: Jesus bless me (quoth Cloth breeches) what
a Ging was here gathered together, no doubt Hell is broke loose, and the Devil
means to keep holyday, I make challenge against them all, as against worse
men than those that gave evidence against Christ: for the Sumner it boots me
to say little more against him, than Chaucer did in his Canturbury tales, who
said he was a knave, a bribar, and a bawd, but leaving that authority although
it be authentical, yet thus much I can say of my self, that these drunken
drowsy sons go a tooting abroad (as they themselves term it) which is to here
if any man has got his maid with child or plays the goodfellow with his
neighbors wife, if he find a hole in any man's coat that is of wealth, then he
has his peremptory scitation ready to site him unto the Archdeacons or
officials court, there to appear and abide the shame and penalty of the law,
the man perhaps in good credit with his neighbors, loath to bring his name in
question, greseth the sumner in the fist, and then he wipes him out of the
book, and suffers him to get twenty with child so he keep him warm in the
hand: he has a saying to wanton wives, and they are his good dames, and as
long as they feed him with cheese bacon, capons, and such od reuersio^s they
are honest, and be they never so bad, he swears to the official complaints are
made upon envy and the women of good behauior: tush what bawdrie is it he will
not suffer, so he may have money and good chere, and if he like the wench well an
snatch himself for they know all the whores in a country, and are as
lecherous companions as may be, to be brief, the sumner lives upon sins of
people, and out of harlotry gets he al his commodity. As for the Jailer,
although I have been little troubled in prison to have experience of his
knauerie, yet have I heard the pore prisoners complain how cruel they be to
the^, extorting with extraordinary fees, selling a double curtall (as they call
it) with a double iug of beer for 2 pence, which contains not above a pint and
a half: let a poor man but be arrested into one of the counters, though he
but set his foot in them but half an hour, he shall be almost at an angels
charge, what with garnish, crossing and wiping out of the book, turning the
key, paieng the chamberlain, feeing for his jury, and twenty such extortions
invented by themselves, and not allowed by any statute, God bles me jailer from
your henhouses, as I will keep you from coming in my quest, and to you M.
Informer, you that look like a civil Citizen, or some handsome petty sogger
of the law: although your crimson nose bewraies you can sup of a cool cup or
Sack without any chewing, yet have you as much fly knauerie in your side
pouch there, as would breed the confusion of forty honest men. It may be
sir you marvel, why I exclaim against the informer, since he is a most
necessary member in the common wealth, and is highly to the Princes advantage
for the benefit of pennall statutes and other abuses, whereof he gives special
intelligence? To wipe out this doubt I speak not against the office but the
officer, against such as abuse law when they should use it, and such none I
guess this fellow to be, by the carnation tincture of his ruby nose. Therefore
let us search his bag, and see what trash you shall find in it: with that
although the informer were very loath, yet we plucked out the stuffing of his
pouch, and in it was found a hundredth and odd writs: Whereat I wondered: and
Cloth breeches smiling, bad me read she Labels, and the parties names, and
then examine the informer how many of them he knew, and wherein they had
offended. I followed his counsel, and of all he knew but three, neither
could he tell what they had done amiss to be arested and brought in question.

Cloth breeches seeing me stand in a maze, began thus to resolve me in my
doubt. Perhaps, quoth he, you marvel why the informer has all these writtes,
and knows neither the parties nor can object any offense to them? To this I
answer: That it being a long vacation, he learned in the roll all those men's
names, and that they were men of in different wealth: Now means he to go
abroad and search them out and arrest them, and though they know not wherein or
for what cause they should be troubled, yet rather then they will come up to
London and spend their money, they will bestow some odd Angel of Master
infourmer, and so sit at home in quiet. But suppose some be so stubborn as to
stand to the trial, yet can this cunning knave declare a Tam quam against
them, so that though they be cleared, yet can they have no recompense at all,
for that he does it in the Courts behalf, I will not unfold all his villainies,
but he is an abuser of good laws and a very knave, and so let him be, with his
fellows. I both wondered and laughed to hear Clothbreeches make this discourse,
when I saw two in the valley together by the ears, the one in leather, the
other as black as the Devil: I stepped to them to part the fray, and questioned
what they were, and wherefore they brawled: Marry, quoth he, that looked like
Lucifer, though I am black I am not the Devil, but indeed a Collier of
Croyden, and one sir that have sold many a man a false sack of coals, that
both wanted measure and was half full of dust and dross. Indeed I have been
a lieger in my time in London, and have played many mad prankes for which
cause, you may see I am made a curtall, for the Pillorie has eaten off both my
ears, and now sir this ropemaker hunteth me here with his halters, I guess
him to be some evil spirit, that in the likeness of a man would since I have
past the pillory persuade me to hang my self for my old offenses, and therefore
sith I cannot bless me from him with Nomine patris, I lay Spiritus sanctus
about his shoulders with a cudgel, that he may get out of my company. The
ropemaker replied, that honestly iourneyeng by the way, he acquainted himself
with the Colliar, and for no other cause pretended. And whether are you a going
quoth, I? Marry sir quoth he, first to absolve your question, I dwell in Saffron
Waldon, and am going to Cambridge to three sons that I keep there at school,
such apt children sir as few women have groned for, and yet they have ill
luck. The one sir is a Divine to comfort my soul, and he indeed though he be
a vain glorious ass, as diverse youths of his age be, is well given to the
show of the world, and writ a late the lamb of God, and yet his parishioners
say he is the limb of the devil, and kisseth their wives with holy kisses, but
they had rather he should keep his lips for madge his mare. The second sir, is
a Physician or a fool, but indeed a physician, and had proved a proper man if
he had not spoiled himself with his Astrological discourse of the terrible
conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter. For the eldest, he is a Ciuilian, a
wondrous witted fellow, sir reverence sir, he is a Doctor, Such a Richard by S.
Harry look to it for all the Poets in England will have a blow at your breech
for calling the^ poperlye make plays, and will if you reconcile not your self
bring your worship on the stage.
and as Tubalcain was the first inuenter of Music, so he Gods benison light
upon him, was the first that invented English Hexamiter: but see how in these
days learning is little esteemed, for that and other familiar letters and
proper treatises he was orderly clapped in the Fleet, but sir a Hawk and a Kite
may bring forth a coystrell, and honest parents may have bad children. Honest
with the devil quoth the Colliar, How can he be honest, whose mother I guess was a
witch. For I have heard them say, that witches say their prayers backward, and
so does the ropemaker yerne his living by going backward, and the knaves chief
living is by making fatal instruments, as halters and ropes, which diverse
desperate men hang themselves with. Well quoth I, what say you to these, shall they
be on the Jury? Velvet breeches said nothing, but Cloth breeches said, in the
ropemaker he found no great falsehood in him, therefore he was willing he should
be one, but for the Colliar he thought it necessary that as he came so he
should depart, so then I bad the ropemaker stand by til more came, which was
not long. For there came 3. in a cluster. As Soon as they drewnie, I spied one,
a fat churl with a side russet cote to his knee, and his hands all to tanned
with shifting his Ouse, yet would I not take notice what they were, but
questioned them their occupations. Marry quoth the first, I am a tanner, the
second a shoemaker, the third a Currier: then turning to the plaintiff and
defendant, I asked them if they would allow of those parties. No by my faith quoth
Clothbreeches, I make challenge unto them al, and I will yield reasons of import
against them, and first to you M. Tanner. Are you a man worthy to be on a
jury, when your conscience ears not to wrong the whole Commonwealth? you
respect not public commodity, but private gains: not to benefit your
neighbor, but for to make the proud princocxe your son an vpstart
Gentleman, and because you would marry your Daughter at the least to an
Esquire, that she may if it be possible, be a Gentlewoman, and how comes this
to pass, by your Tan-fats forsooth: For whereas by the statutes of England
you should let a hide lie in the Ouse at the least nine months, you can make
good leather of it before three months, you have your Doves doong, your
marle, your Ashen bark, and a thousand things more, to bring on your leather
apace, that it is so badly tanned, that when it comes to the wearing, then it
fleetes away like a piece of brown paper: and whereas your backs of all other
should be best tanned, you bring them so full of horn to the market, that did
you not grease the sealers of Leaden Hall thoroughly in the fiste, they should
never be sealed, but turned away and made forfeit by the statute. I cannot at
large lay open your subtle practices to beguile the poor communalitie with
badde leather. But let this suffice, you leave no villainie unsought, to bring
the blockhead your son to go before the Clown his father, trimlye trickt
up in a pair of velvet breeches.

Now master Currier to your coosenage, you cannot be content only to burn
the Leather you dress for fault of liquor, because you would make the
shoemaker pay well and you put in little stuff: and beside, when as in backs
you should only put in Tallow hard and good, you put in soft kitchen stuff
mixed, and so make the good and well tanned Leather by your villainy to fleet
and waste away, but also you grow to be an extorting knave and a forestaller of
the market. For you will buy Leather, sides, backs, and Calves skins, and
sell them to poor shomakers at an unreasonable rate, by your false retailing,
getting infinite goods by that excessive price: both undoing the poor
shoemaker, and causing us that we pay extremely for shoes. For if the
Currier bought not Leather by the whole of the Tanner, the shoemaker might have
it at a more reasonable price: but the shoemaker being poor, is not perhaps
able to deal with a dicker of Hides, nor perhaps with a couple of backs, and
the Tanner will not trust him: then the extorting and coosening Currier coms
up with this, I will lend you for a day and so pincheth him, that he is
searce able to find his children bread. But well has the Prince and the
Honorable Lords of the privy Counsel provided by Act of Parliament, that no
Currier shall buy leather either hides or backs of the Tanner, so to bridle the
extorting and forestalling coosenage, but craftilyer and subteller has the
knave Currier crosbitten the statute, in that he deals thus with the Tanner,
he makes him hold his leather unreasonably to the shoemaker, and so when he
cannot sell it, he lays it up in the Curriers house, under a color whereas
indeed he has sold it him. Suppose this shifte be spied and prevented: then
compoundeth he with some knave shoemaker, some base rakehell without a
conscience, that neither respects God, the Commonwealth, nor his Company,
and forsooth he is half with the Currier, who lets him have some hundredth
mark to lay out for leather every month, whereas he spends not in his shop a
hundred marks worth in a year: so the shoemaker buies it to abuse the statute
for the Currier, and the Currier by that means vndooeth the other shoomakers:
thus two crafty knaves are met and they need no broker.

Now to you gentle craft, you mass shoemaker: you can put in the inner sole,
of a thin Calves skin, when as the shoo is a neates leather shoo, which you
know is clean contrary both to conscience and the statute. Beside, you will
join a neates leather vampey to a calves leather heel: is not here good
stuff master shomaker. Well for your knauerie, you shall have these cursses
which belongs unto your craft: you shall be light footed to travel far,
light witted upon every small occasion to give your masters the bag, you
shall be most of you unthrifts, and almost all perfect goodfellows. Beside I
remember a meryiest how S. Peter brought you to a dangerous disease, for he
requested a boon for you, which fell out to your great disadvantage, and to
recreat us a little here Gentle craft, what fell to your trade by that holy
saint. It chanced that on a day, saint Peter and Christ walking together, Peter
was wonderfully hungry, and had no money in his pursse to buy him any food,
and at last to his great comfort he espied where a company of Tailors were at
Dinner with buttred pease, eating their pease with their needles points one by
one: saint Peter came to them and asked them his alms, they proudly bad him
sit down and do as he saw they did, and with that delivered him a needle. The
poor saint being passing hungry, could not content his mawe with eating one by
one, but turned the eye of his needle and eat two or three together: which the
Tailors seeing, they start up and said, What fellow: a shouell and a spade
to butterd pease, have thou no more manners? Get out of our company, and so
they sent him packing with many strokes. Peter coming back, Christ demanded
of him what news: and he told him how churlishlye he was used amongst the
Tailors. Well, wandering on further, Peter espied where a company of shoomakers
were at Dinner, with powdered beef and brewesse, going to them before he
could ask them any alms, they said, welcome good fellow, What is thy
stomach up, will thou do as we do, and taste of beef? saint Peter thanked
them and sat down and eat his belly full, and drank well of good double
beer, And when he had done went home to his master. As Soon as he came
Christ asked him what news, and he said: Oh master, I have lighted amongst a
crew of shooemakers, the best fellows that ever I met withal, they have
frankly fed me without grudging, and therefore master grant me a boon for
them. Ask what thou will Peter, quoth he, and it shall be done? Why then Lord,
quoth he, grant that for this good turn they have done me. they may ever
spend a groat before they can yearn two pence. It shall be granted quoth he.
Peter as soon as Christ had said the word, he bethought himself and said: Nay
Lord, but that they may yearne a groat before they spend two pence, for my
tongue slipped at the first. Well Peter quoth he, it cannot be recald the first
wish must stand, and hereof by saint Peter's boon it grew, that all of the
Gentle craft are such good fellows and spendthriftes. But howsoever, none of
those three, neither shoemaker, Tanner, nor Currier, shall be accepted to be of
the Jury.

As they went away with fleas in their ears, being thus taunted by Cloth
breeches, we might see where there came a troop of ancient Gentlemen, with
their seruingemen attending upon them. The foremost was a great old man, with a
white bearde all in russet, and a fair black cloak on his back, and
attending on him he had some five men, there cognizance as I remember was a
Peacocke without a tail, the other two that accompanied him, seemed meaner
then himself, But yet Gentlemen of good worship. Whereupon I went toward
them, and saluted them, and was so bold as to question what they were, and of
their business.

The most antientest answered he was a Knight, and those two his neighbors,
the one an Esquire, the other a Gentleman, and that they have no urgent
affairs, but only to walk abroad to take the fresh air. Then did I show them
both Cloth breeches, and Velvet breeches, and told them the controversy, and
desired their aid to be upon the Jury. They smiling answered, They were
content, and so did Cloth breeches seem to rejoice, that such honest ancient,
English Gentlemen should be tryers of his Title, But Velvet breeches storming,
stepped in and made challeng to them all. I demanded the reason why he should
refuse Gentlemen of so good calling? And he made me this answer. Why you may
guess the inward mind by the outward apparel and see how he is adicted by the
homly robes he is suited in. Why this knight is mortal enemy to pride and so to
me: he regards hospitality and aims at honor with releeuing the poor, you
may see although his lands and revenues be great, and he able to maintain
himself in great bravery, yet he is content with homespun cloth, and scorneth
the pride that is used nowadaies amongst young vpstartes, he houldeth not the
worth of his Gentry to be and consist in Velvet breeches, but valeweth true
fame by the report of the common sort who praise him for his virtue, Justice,
liberality, housekeeping and almesdeedes, Vox populi vox dei, his tennants and
Farmers would if it might be possible, make him immortal with their prayers
and praises. He raises no rent, racketh no lands, takes no incumbs, imposes
no merciless fines, enuies not an other, buyeth no house over his neighbors
head: but respects his country and the commodity thereof, as dear as his
life. He regards more to have the needy fed, to have his boorde garnished
with full platters, then to famous himself with excessive furniture in
apparel. Since then he scorneth pride, he must of force proclaim himself
mine enemy, and therefore he shall be none of my Jury, and such as himself I
guess the Squire and the gentleman and therefore I challenge them al three. Why
quoth I, this is strange, that a man should be drawn from a quest for his
godliness. If men for virtue be challenged, whom shall we have upon the
Jury? Your objection helps not master Velvet breeches: For if he be a man of
so godly a disposition, he will neither speak for fear or favor, he will
regard neither the riches of the one, nor the plain poverty of the other.
Whereupon since you have made me trier, I allow them all three to be of the
Jury, and so I requested them to sit down till our Jury was full, which they
courteously did, although velvet breeches frouned at it. When I looking for
more, saw where there came a troop of men, in apparel seeming poor honest
Citizens, in all they were eight. I demanded of them what they were, and
whither they were going. One of them that seemed the welthiest, who was in a
furred Iacket made answer, that they were all friends going to the burial of a
neighbor of theirs, that yester night died, and if would do me any pleasure
to hear their names, they were not so dainty but that they would tell them,
and so then he began to tell me, that by his Art he was a Skinner, the second
said he was a Ioyner, the third was a Sadler, the fourth a waterman, the
fifte was a Cutler, the sixth was a Bellows mender, the seventh a plaisterer,
and the eight a Printer. In good time quoth I, it is commendable when
neighbors love so well together, but if your speed be not overmuch, I must
request you to be of a jury, so I discourst unto them the controversy between
Clothbreeches and Veluetbreeches, and to what issue it must grow by a verdict,
they seemed all content, and I turned to the plaintiff and defendant, and
asked if they would make challenge to any of these. I skorne quoth Veluetbreeches,
to make any great objection against them, since they be mecanical men, and I
almost hold them indifferent for this I know, they get as much and more by me
than by him, the skinner I use for furs, whereas this base clothbreeches has
scarce a gown faced once in his life, the sadler for costly imbroidered
saddles, the ioyner for seeling my house, the cutler for gylt rapyers, the
waterman I use continually, ten times for his once, and so likewise the
plaisterer, for the bellowsmender alas poor snake I know him not, for the
Printer by our Lady I think I am some ten pounds in his debt for books, so
that for my part let them all pass. And for me to, quoth Clothbreeches, but yet a
little to put them in remembrance of their folies, let me have about with them
all, and first with you maisser skinner, to whom I can say little but only
this, that whereas you should only put the backs of skins into facing, you taw
the wombs and so deceive the buier, beside if you have some fantastike skin
brought you not worth two pence, with some strange spots though it be of a
libbet, you will swear it is a most precious skin, and came from Musco or the
furthest parts of Calabria. The Sadler he stuffes his pannels with straw or hay
and ouerglaseth them with hair, and makes the lether of them of morts, or tand
sheeps skins. The ioyner though an honest man, yet he makes his joints
weak, and puts in sap in the morteses which should be the heart of the
tree, and all to make his stuff slender. And you cutler, you are patron of
ruffions and swashbucklers, and will sell them a blade that may be thrust into a
bushel, but if a poor man that cannot skill of it you sell him a swoorde or
rapier new ouerglased, and swear the blade came either from Turkey or Toledo.
Now master Waterman you will say there is no subtlety in you, for there is
none so simple but that knows your fares and what is due between Greenwiche
and London, and how you earn your money painfully with the sweat of your brows,
all this is true, but let me whisper one thing in your ear, you will play the
goodfellow too much if you be well greased in the fist, for if a young
Gentleman and a pretty wench come to you and say, Waterman, my friend and I
mean to go by water and to be merry a night or two, I care not which way nor
whether we go, and therefore where thou think we may have best lodging
thither carry us: then off goes your cap and away they go, to Brainfoord or
some other place, and then you say, Hostess I pray you use this Gentleman and
his wife well, they are come out of London to take the air and mean to be
merry here a night or two, and to spend their monye frankly, when God wot they
are neither man nor wife, nor perhaps of any acquaintance before their match
made in some bawdie tavern, but you know no such matter, and therefore
waterman I pardon you. And for you plaisterer and bellowsmender I pass you
over and so do I the Printer to, only this I must needs say to him that some
of his trade will print lewd books, and bawdy pamphlets (by M. R.G.) but Auri
sacra fauores quid non, and therefore I am content they shall be all of the
jury. I was glad there were so many accepted of at once, and hoped that now
quickly the jury would be full, looking about me, straight I might see one
alone come running as fast as he could, I woondred what he should be that he
made such have, and the Skinner told me he was an honest man, and one of their
company, by his occupation a bricklaier. Oh quoth veluetbreeches, a good honest
simple man, he has bin long in my work in building me a sumptuous house. But
I challenge him, quoth clothbreeches, for he is a iugler. How quoth I can it be, see
he goes very homely in leather and has his ruler in his hand and his trowel
at his side, and he seems not as one that were given to such qualities. Yes
(quoth clothbreeches) he has this policy, when he makes a stately place all
glorious to the eye and full of fair chambers and goodly rooms, and about the
house perhaps some threescore chimnies, yet he can so cunningly cast by his
art that three of them shall not smoke in the tweluemonth, and so spoils he
much good mortar and brick. Why quoth I, the fault is not in the workman but the
housekeeper, for now adays men build for to please the eye not to profit the
poor, they use no roast, but for themselves and their household, nor no fire but
in a little court chunnie in their own chamber, how can the poor bricklaier
then be blamed, when the niggardnesse of the Lord or master is the cause no
more chimnies do smoke, for would they use ancient hospitality as their
forefathers did, and value as lightly of pride as their great graundfathers,
then should you see every chimny in the house smoke, and prove that the poor
Artificer had done his part. Why then quoth Clothbreeches as you please, admit
him on the quest. But what be these quoth Clothbreeches, that come here so
soberly? I hope they be honest men, for they look very demure, I will inquire
said I, and with that stepping to them, I demanded their names and very
courtiouslye the one said he was a brewer, the other a butcher, the third a
baker, and the fourth a vitler. Hearing what they were, I was glad, ghessing
since they were so honest substantial men that they would help to make up the
jury, when Veluetbreeches with a grim and sower countenance gave them this
challenge. I hold it not necessary (quoth he) that these have any thing to
deal in my cause, since I am at odds with them al at least in forty pounds a
piece, for this seven years I have been indebted unto them for bread, beef,
bear and other victuals, then since they have credited me long, and I have had
so little care to pay them, I doubt now they will revenge themselves and
pass against me in the verdicte. Nay (quoth I) the rather will they hold on
your part, for if they be honest wise men (as they seem to be) they will be
careful of your prefermente, seeing the more highly they are aduaunst, the
more like are they to come by their own. If therefore you can object no other
points of dishonesty against them, I see no reason why they should be put by.
If you do not ( quoth clothbreeches) then here me and I will prove them unfit to
have any dealings here, and first for the Butcher. I pray you goodman
kilcalfe, what havoc play you with puffing up of meat, and blowing with your
prickar as you flea it, have you not your artificial knaueries to set out your
meat with pricks, and then swear he has more for money than ever you
bought, to sell a piece of an old Cow for a chop of a young Ox, to wash your
old meat that has hung weltring in the shop with new blood, to trusse away
an old eaw in stead of a young weather, and although you know it is hurtful
and forbidden by statutes to flea your hides, skins, and backs, with cuts and
slashes to the impouerishing of the pore shoemaker when he buies it, yet I pray
you how many flaughters do you make in a poor Calves skin? Oh Butcher, a
long lent be your punishment, for you make no conscience in deceiving the
poor. And you mast Brewer that grow to be worth forty thousand pounds by
selling of sodden water, what subtlety have you in making your bear to spare
the malt and put in the more of the hoppe to make your drink (be barley never so
cheap) not a whit the stronger and yet never sell a whit the more measure for
money, you can when you have taken all the heart of the malt away, then clap
on store of water it is cheap enough, and mashe out a tunning of small bear, so
thin that it scoures a man's maw like rennish wine: in your conscience how many
barrels draw you out of a quarter of malt, fie, fie, I conceal your falsehood,
least I should be too broad in setting down your faults. And as for you
goodman Baker, that delight to be seen where most people resort, even on the
pillory in the chief market place, the world cries out of your wiliness, you
crave but one dear year to make your daughter a gentlewoman, you buy your corn
at the best hand, and yet will not be content to make your bread weight, you
put in yeast and salt to make it heavy, and yet all your policy can not make
it but you fine for the Pillorie, the poor cry out, the rich find fault, and
the Lord Mayor of London and the Shirifs like honorable and worshipful
maiestrates every day walk abroad and weigh your bread, and yet all will not
serve to make you honest men, but were extremity used, and the statute put in
the highest degree in practice, you would have as few ears on your heads as
the collier. Last to you Tom tapster, that tap your small cannes of bear to
the poor, and yet fill them half full of froth that card your bear (if you
see your guests begin to be drunk) half small and half strong, you cannot
be content to pinch with your small pottes and your Ostrie faggots: but you
have your trugges to draw men on to villainy, and to bring customers to your
house, where you sell a joint of meat for xii. pence that cost you scarce six,
and if any chance to go on the skore you skore him when he is a sleep, and
set up a grote a day more than he has, to find you drinking pots with your
companions, to be short, thou art a knave, and I like not of any of the rest,
the way lies before you, and therefore you may be gone for you shall be none
of the quest. I smilde to see Clothbreeches so peremptory, when I saw five fat
fellows all in damask cotes and gowns welted with Velvet very brave, and in
great consultation, as if they were to determine of some weighty matter,
drawing near I saw they were welthy citizens, so I went and reverently
saluted them, and told them how we needed their aid about the appeasing of a
controversy, showing them where the knighte, esquier, and other staid, til we
might find men to fill up the jury, they were contented, but veluetbreeches
excepted against four of them and said they were none of his friends, that was
the merchant, goldsmith, mercer and draper, his allegations were these, that
they were al feathered of one wing to fetch in young gentlemen by commodities
under the color of lending of money: for the merchant he delivered the iron,
tin, lead, hops, sugars, spices, oiles, brown paper or whatsoever else from
six months to six mo^ths, which when the pore gentleman came to sell again, he
could not make threescore and ten in the hundred beside the usury. The mercer
he follows the young vpstart gentleman that has no government of himself,
and he feeds his humor to go brave, he shall not want silks, sattins,
veluets, to prank^ abroad in his pomp, but with this prouiso, that he must
bind over his land in a statute merchant or staple, and so at last forfeit al
unto the merciless mercer, and leave himself never a foot of ground in
England, which is the reason that for a few remnaunts of veluets and silks
the Mercer creeps into whole lordships. The Goldsmith is not behind, for
most of them deal with Usury, and let young gentlemen have commodities of
plate for ten in the hundred, but they must loose the fasion in selling it
again (which cuts them sore) beside they are most of them skild in alcumie and
can temper metals shrewdly, with no little profit to themselves and
disaduauntage to the buier, beside puff ringes, and quaint conceits which I
omit. And so for you Draper, he fetches them off for livery cloth, and cloth
for six months and six, and yet has he more knacks in his budget, for he has
so dark a shop that no man can well choose a piece of cloth it so shadows the
die and the thread, a man shall be deceived in the wool and the nappe, they
cause the Clothworker so to press them, besides he imposes this charge to the
Clothworker that he draw his cloth and pull it passing hard when he sets it
upon the tenters, that he may have it full breadth and length, till thread and
all tear and rent a pieces, what care they for that, have they not a drawer to
serve their turn to draw and seame up the holes so cunningly that it shall
never be espied? my self have seen in one broad cloth eighteen score holes
torn rackt and pulde by the Clothworker* only to please the draper and deceive
the commonwealth. To be short, the Clothworker what with rowing and setting in
a fine nap, with powdering it and pressing it, with shering the wool to the
proof of the thread, deal so cunningly that they prove themselves the drapers
minister to execute his subtilties, therefore if he chance to come let him be
remembered* Now sir for the vintner, he is an honest substantial man a friend
to al good fellows* and truly my friend for my money, and worthy to be of the
jury. Why no quoth clothbreeches I am of another mind, for I hold him as
deceitful as any of the rest, what the vintner, why he is a kind of
Negromancer, for at midnight when al men are in bed then he forsooth falls to
his charms and spells, so that he tumbles one hogshead into another, and can
make a cup of claret that has lost his color look high with a dash of red
wine at his pleasure, if he has a strong Gascoigne wine, for fear it should
make his guests to soon drunk, he can allaye it with a small Rochell wine:
he can cherish up white wine with sack, and perhaps if you bid him wash the
pot clean when he goes to draw you a quart of wine he will leave a little water
in the bottom, and then draw it up full of wine, and what and if he do? it is no
harm wine and water is good against the heat of the liver. It were infinite to
rehearse the iugling of Vintners, the disorder of their houses, espetially of
the persons that frequent them, and therefore since Veluetbreeches has put by
the merchant, goldsmith, mercer and draper, the vintner shall go with the^ for
company. As these were going away in a snuff for being thus plainly taunted,
we might see a mad merry crew come leping over the field as frolikly as if
they ought not all the world two pence, and drawing nearer we might perceive
that either bottle-ale or beer had made a fraye with them, for the lifting of
their feet showed the lightness of their heads, the foremost was a plain
country sir John, or vickar that proclaimed by the rednes of his nose he did
oftener go into the alehouse than the pulpit, and him I asked what they were and
whether they were going: what are you quoth the priest that stand by the high way
to examine me and my friends, here is none in my company but are able to answer
for themselves. I seeing they were al set on a merry pin, told him the cause
and how the controversy grew betwixt Clothbreeches and veluetbreeches and that
we needed them to be of the quest. Mary ( quoth sir John) a good motion, know the
sealare my parishioners, and we have bin drinking with a poor man and spending
our money with him, a neighbor of ours that has lost a cow, now for our names
and our trades, this is a smith, the second a weauer, the third a millar, the
fourth a cook, the fifth a carpentar, the sixth a glouer, the vij. a pedlar the
eight a tinkar, the ix. a waterbearer, the tenth a husba^dman, the xi. a diar,
and the xii. a saylor, and I their vickar: how could you sir have a fitter
jury than me and my parishioners? you are a little too brief, quoth
clothbreeches, are you not some puritan M. parson, or some fellow that rayseth
up new scismes and heresies amongst your people? A plague on them all quoth sir
John. for the world was never in quiet, devotion, neighborhood nor
hospitality never flourished in this land since such vpstart boys and shittle
witted fools becam of the ministry, such I mean as Greenwood Martin, Barrow,
Wigginton, and such rakehels, I cannot tell they preach faith, faith, and say
that doing of alms is papistrie, but they have taught so long Fides solam
iustificat, that they have preached good works quite out of our parish, a poor
man shall as soon break his neck as his fast at a rich man's door: for my
friend, I am in deed none of the best scholars yet I can read an homily every
sundaye and holiday, and I keep company with my neighbors, and go to the
alehouse with them, and if they be fallen out, spend my money to make them
friends, and on sundaies sometime if goodfellowship call me away, I say both
morning and evening prayer at once, and so let them have a whole afternoon to
play in. This is my life, I spend with living with my parishioners, I seek to
do al good, and I offer no man harm. Well ( quoth clothbreeches) I warrant thou art
an honest vickar, and therefore stand by, thou shall be one of the quest, and
for you smith, I see no great fault in you, you earn your living with the sweat
of your brows, and there can be no great knauerie in you, only I would have
you mende your life for drinking since you are never at quiet unless the pot be
still at your nose. But you Weauer, the Proverb puts you down for a crafty
Knave, you can filche and steal almost as ill as the Tailor, your woofe and
warpe is so cunningly drawn out that you plague the poor Country huswines for
their yarne, and dawbed on so much dregs that you make it seem both well
wrought and to bear weight, when it is slenderly wouen, and you have stolen a
quarter of it from the poor wife. Away, be packing, for you shall be cashierd.
What Miller, shake hands with your brother the Weauer for knavery: You can take
toll twice, and have false hoppers to convey away the poor man's meal, Be
gone, I love not your dusty looks, and for company goodmanne Cook go you
with them, for you coosen the poor men and Country Tearmers with your filthy
meat: you will buy of the worst and cheapest, when it is bad enough for dogs,
and yet so powder it and perboile it, that you will sell it to some honest
poor men, and that unreasonably to: If you leave any meat over night, you
make a shift to heat it again the next day: Nay, if on the Thursday at night
there be any left, you make pies of it on sunday morninges, and almost with
your slovenly knauerie poison the poor people. To be short, I brook you not,
and therefore be walking. For the Carpenter, Glouer, and Waterbearer, the
Husbandman, Dier, and Sailor, since you trades have but petty sleights, stand
you with May. Vicar, you are like to help to give in the verdict: but for the
peddler and the Tinker, they are two notable knaves, both of a hair, and both
cosen Germans to the Devil. For the Tinker, why he is a drowsy, bawdy,
drunken companion, that walks up and down with a trug after him, and in
stopping one hole makes three: and if in convenient place he meets with one
alone, perhaps risle him or her of all that ever they have. A base knave
without fear of God or love to any one but to his whore and to himself. The
Peddler as bad or rather worse, walks the Country with his docksey at the
least, if he have not two his mortes dels, and Autem mortes, he passes
commonly through every pair of stocks, either for his drunkenness or his
lechery. And beside it is reported you can lift or nip a bounge like a guire
Coue, if you want pence, and that you carry your pack but for a color to
shadow your other villainies. Well howesoeuer, you are both knaves and so be
iogging. Well quoth I, suppose the Jury is almost full, I believe we want not
above three or four persons: Look you where they come to make up the
number, and they should be men of good disposition, for they seem to be all of
the Country. As Soon as they came to us I met them, and told them the matter,
and they were content. The one said he was a Grasier, the other a Farmer, the
other shepherd to them both. What think you of these three quoth I? Marry
says Velvet breeches, twoe of them are honest men, but the other is a base
knave: but it is no matter, shuffle him in amongst the rest. Nay by your leave
quoth Cloth breeches, I will shuffle out these two, for they are the very
Cormorants of the Country, and devour the poor people with their monsterous
exactions. And first I allege against the Grasier, that he forestalleth
pastures and meadow grounds, for the feeding of his cattle, and wringeth leases
of them out of poor men's hands, and in his buyeng of cattle he commits
great usury, for if it prove a wet year, then he makes havoc and sells
dear: if it be a dry year, then he buyeth cheap, and yet having pasture
keeps them till he may come to his own prise: he knows as well as the
Butcher by the feed of a bullock how much Tallow he will yield, what his
quarters will amount unto: what the Tanner will give for the Hide: Nay, what the
sowse wives were able to make of the inwards: so that he sels it so dear to
the Butcher, that he can scarce live of it: and therefore what subtlety the
butcher uses, comes from the Grasier, so that I exempt him from the quest as
a bad member, and an ill friend to Cloth breeches. And for you mass. Farmer,
you know how thorough you couetise Landelordes raise their rentes, for if a
poor man have but a plough land, if you see his pastures bear good grass,
and his earable ground good corn, and that he prospers and goes forward on
it and provides and maintains his wife and servants honestly, then Inuidus
alterius rebus macressit opimis, vicinumque pecus grandius vber habet.

Then straight envy pricks the farmer forward, and he bids the Landelord far
more then the poor man paies yearly for it: so that if he be a Tenant at
will, he puts him out to beg in the street: or when his lease comes out he
ouerloades him in the fine, and thus bloudsucketh he the poor for his own
private profit. Besides the base chuffe if he sees a forward year and that
corn is like to be plenty, then he murmureth against God, and swears and
protests he shall be undone: respecting more the filling of his own coffers
by a dearth, then the profit of his country by a general plenty. Besides sir
may it please you, when new corn comes into the market, who bringes in to
relieve the state? Not your maistership, but the poor husbandman, that wants
pence. For you keep it to the back end of the year, nay you have your
Garners which have corn of two or three year old, upon hope still of a dear
year, rather letting the Weasels eat it, then the poor should have it at any
reasonable price. So that I conclude, you are a Cormorant of the common wealth,
and a wretch that lives of the spoil of the needy, and so I leave you to iet
with the Grasier. Marry for the shepherd, unless it be that he kills a
Lamb now and then, and says the Fox stole him, I know little craft in his
budget, therefore let him be among the honest men of the Jury.

Well Cloth breeches quoth I, you are very peremptory in your challenges, what
say you here comes 3. or 4. Cityzens, will any of these serve turn? I cannot
tell quoth he till I know their names and conditions. With that I stepped before the
company, and inquired what they were. The eldest of them being a grave Citizen,
said he was a Grocer, the rest his good and honest neighbors, a Chandler, a
Haberdasher, a Clothworker, and two strangers, one a Wallon the other a
Dutchman. How like you of these quoth I to Velvet breeches? well enough quoth
he, for I am little acquainted with them, yet I know they favor me, because I
have on a sunday seen them all in their silks. I marry, quoth cloth breeches,
but they never get that bravery with honesty, For the cloth worker his faults
were laid open, Before when we had the Draper in question: and therefore let
him be packing. For you Chandler, I like not of your tricks; you are to
conversant with the kitchen stuff wives you after your week or snaft is
stiffened, you dip it in filthy dross, and after give him a coat of good
tallowe, which makes the Candles drop and wast away, to the great hindrance of
the poor workman that watches in the night. Beside you pinch in your waights
and have false mesures, and many other knaueries that I omit, but this be sure
you shall not meddle in my matter: neither the Haberdasher, For he trims up
old felts and makes them very fair to the eye, and faceth and edgeth them
neatly, and then he turns them away to such a simple man as I am: and so
abuses us with his coosenage. Beside you buy gumd taffata, wherewith you line
hats that will straight assunder as soon as it comes to the heat of a man's
head. To be brief, I am not well skild in your knaueries, but indeed you are
to subtle for poor Cloth breeches, and therefore you shall be none of the
Jury. Marrye the Grocer seems an honest man, and I am content to admit of
him, only take this as a caveat by the way, that you buy of the Garbellers of
spices, the refuse that they sifte from the merchant, and that you mix again
and sell it to your customers. Besides, in your beaten spices, as in pepper,
you put in Bay berries, and such dross, and so wring the poor, but these are
slight causes and so I ouerpasse them, and vouchsafe you to be of the quest.

But I pray you what be those two honest men, quoth the Grocer, The one a Dutchman
and a shoemaker, the other a Frenchman and a Myllaner in saint Martins, and
sels shirts, bands, bracelets, Jewels, and such pretty toies for Gentlewomen:
oh they be of velvet breeches acquaintance, vpstarts as well as he, that have
brought with them pride and abuses into England: and first to the Millainer.
What toies deuiseth he to feed the humor of the vpstart Gentleman withal, and
of fond Gentlewomen? such fannes, such ouches, such brooches, such bracelets,
such graundcies, such periwigs, such paintings, such ruffes and cufs, as has
almost made England as full of proud fopperies as Tire and Sydon were. There is
no Seamster can make a band or a shirt, so well as his wife: and why forsooth?
because the filthy queen wear a craunce and is a Frenchwoman forsooth. Where
as our English women of the Exchange, are both better workwomen, and will
afford a better peniworth. And so for the drunken Dutchman, this shoemaker, he
and such as he is, abuses the Common wealth, and the poor mechanical men and
handicrafts men of London, for our new vpstart fools of Velvet breeches
fraternity, likes nothing but that the outlandish Ass makes. They like no
shoo so well as the Dutchman makes, when our English men pass them far.
And so for Chandlers, and all other occupations, they are wronged by the Dutch
and French. And therefore since the Commons hates them, they cannot be my
friends, and therefore let them be launching to Flushing, for they shall be no
triers of my controversy. Well quoth I, now I suppose the Jury is full, and we
see no more coming, let us call them and see how many we have. So they
appeared to their names, as follows.

The Names of the Jury to be empanelled.
1 Knight. 2 Esquire. 3 Gentleman. 4 Priest. 5 Printer. 6 Grocer. 7 Skinner. 8
Dier. 9 Pewterer. 10 Sadler. 11 Ioyner. 12 Bricklaier. 13 Cutler. 14
Plaisterer. 15 Saylor. 16 Ropemaker. 17 Smith. 18 Glouer. 19 Husbandman. 20
Shepherd. 21 Waterman. 22 Waterbearer. 23 Bellowsmender.
What is it not possible quoth I, to have one more to make up the four and
twenty? As I was thus speaking, I espied a far off, a certain kind of an
ouerworne Gentleman attired in Velvet and sattyn, but it was somewhat dropped
and greasy, and boots on his legs, whose soles waxed thin seemed to
complain of their Master which treading thrift under his feet, had brought
them unto that consumption, he walked not as other men in the Common beaten
way, but came compassing Circum circa, as if we had been Devils, and he
would draw a Circle about us, and at every third step he looked back, as
if he were afraid of a Bailey or a sergeant.

After him followed two pert Applesquires, The one had a Murrey Cloth gown on,
faced down before with gray Cunnie, and laid thick on the sleeves with lace,
which he quaintly bare up, to show his white Taffata hose and black silk
stockings, a huge ruff about his neck wrapped in his great head like a wicker
Cage, a little hatte with brimmes like the wings of a doublet, wherein he wore
a Jewel of glass, as broad as the Chancery seal: after him followed two
boys in clokes like butter flies, carrieng one of them his cutting sword of
choler, the other his daunsing rapier of delight. His Camerard that bare him
company was a iollie light timberd Jack a Napes, in a suit of watchet Taffata
cut to the skin, with a cloak al to be dawbed with colored lace: both he and
my gowned brother seemed by their pase as if they had some suits to mounsieur
boots. At length coming near, I might discern the first to be a Poet, the
second a Player, the third a Musician, alias the Usher of a Daunsing school.
Well met master Port quoth I, and welcome you friends also, though not so
particularly known. So it is, though none of you three be Common wealths men,
yet upon urgent necessitye we must be forced to employ you. We have a Jury to
be empanelled immediately, which one of you three must help to make up, even he
which approues himself the honestest man. They are all honest men and
goodfellowes quoth Velvet breeches, therefore it is no great matter whether of
them we choose.

The Doctors doubt of that quoth Cloth breeches, for I am of a different
opinion. This first whom by his careless slovenly gate at first sight I
imagined to be a Poet, is a wast good and an unthrift, that he is borne to
make the Tauernes rich and himself a beggar, if he have fourtye pounds in
his purse together, he puts it not to usury, neither buies land nor
Merchandise with it, but a months commodity of wenches and Capons. Ten
pound a supper, Why it is nothing, If his plough goes and his inkhorne be clear:
Take one of them worthy twentye thousand pound and hang him. He is a king of
his pleasure, and counts all other Boores and pesants, that though they have
money at command yet know not like him how to Domaneere with it to any purpose
as they should. But to speak plainly, I think him an honest man if he would
but live within his compass, and generally no man's foe but his own.
Therefore I hold him a man fit to be of my Jury. Nay quoth velvet breeches, I
have more mind to these two, for this Poet is a proud fellow, that because he
has a little wit in his budget will contemn and dislike us that are the
Common sort of Gentlemen, and think we are beholding to him if he do but
bestow a fair look on us. The plaier and the Usher of the dancing school
are plain, honest, humble men, that for a penny or an old cast suit of
apparel. Indeed quoth Cloth breeches you say troth, they are but too humble,
for they be so lowly, that they be base minded, I mean not in their looks
nor apparel, for so they be peacockes and painted asses, but in their course
of life, for they care not how they get crowns, I mean how baselie so they
have them: and yet of the two I hold the Player to be the better Christian,
although he is in his own imagination, too full of self liking and self
love, and is unfit to be of the Jury, though I hide and concele his faults and
fopperies, in that I have been merry at his sports, only this I must say,
that such plain country fellows as my self they bring in as clownes and
fools to laugh at in their play, whereas they get by us, and of our alms the
prowdest of them all does live Well to be brief let him trot to the stage,
for he shall be none of the jury. And for you master usher of the dancing
school, you are a leader into all misrule, you instruct gentlemen to order
their feet when you drive them to misorder their manners, you are a bad fellow
that stand upon your tricks and capers* til you make young gentlemen caper
without their lands, why sir to be flat with you, you live by your legs as a
iugler by his hands, you are given over to the pumps and vanities of the world,
and to be short you are a keeper of misrule and a lewd fellow, and you shall be
none of the inquest. Why then quoth I, you are both agreed that the Poet is he
that must make up the xxiiij? They answered both, he, and none but he. Then I
calling them all together, bad them lay their hands on the book, and first I
called the knight, and after the rest as they followed in order, then I gave them
their charge thus. Worshipful sir, with the rest of the jury whom we have
solicited of choice honest men, whose consciences will deal uprightly in this
controversy, you and the rest of your company are here upon your oath and
oaths to inquire whether Clothbreeches have done disseison unto Veluetbreeches
yea or no in or about London, in putting him out of frank tenement, wronging
him of his right and imbollishing his credit, if you find that Clothbreeches
has done Velvet breeches wrong, then let him be set in his former estate and
allow him reasonable damages. Upon this they laid their hands on the book and
were sworn, and departed to scrutine of the matter by inquiry amongst
themselves, not stirring out of our sight nor staieng long, but straight
returned, and the knight for them all as the for most, said thus So it is that
we have with equity and conscience considered of this controversy between
Veluetbreeches and Clothbreeches, as touching the prerogative of them both,
which are most worthy to be rightlye resident and have seison in frank
tenement here in England, and we do find Clothbreeches is by many hundred
years more ancient, ever since Brute and inhabitant in this Island, one that
has been in Diebus illis a companion to kings, an equal with the nobility, a
friend to gentlemen and yeomen and a patron of the poor, a true subject, a
good housekeper, and general as honest as he is ancient. Whereas Velvet
breeches is an vpstart come out of Italy, begot of Pride, nursed up by
self-love, and brought into this country by his companion new fanglenesse,
that he is but of late time a raiser of rents, and an enemy in the
commonwelth, and one that is not any way to be preferred in equity before
Clothbreeches, therefore by general verdict we adiudge Clothbreeches to have
done him no wrong, but that he has lawfully claimd his title of frank
tenement, and in that we appoint him for ever to be resident. At this verdict
pronounst by the knight, all the standers by clapped their hands, and gave a
mighty shout, whereat I started and awaked, for I was in a dream and in my
bed, and so rose up, and writ in a merry vain what you have heard.

FINIS.
