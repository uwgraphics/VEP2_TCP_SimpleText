Here begins a little treatise of the horse / the sheep / and the ghoos.
Contreuersyes / plees and dyscordes
Between persons were two or three
Sought out the grounds by records
This was the custom of antyquyte
Iuges were set / that had auctoryte
The caas conceived standing Indyfferent
Between parties to give Judgment
Parties assembled of high and low degree
Weren admytted to shown in sentence
Grounded of their quarrels yt law made hem free
Without excepcyon to come in audyence
By the presydent / commanded first scylence
Fredome give / the parties not to spare
By tytell of right their greues to declare
Upon this matter shortly to conclude
Naught yore agone as I rehearse shall
I found to purpose a symplytude
Full craftily depaynted upon a wall
Tweyne sitting in estate Ryall
The fyerse lion famous in all Royames
And themperyall egle percyng the son beams
These were the dredefull Iuges tweyne
In their estate sitting I took keep
That herd the parties by and by complain
The horse the ghoos and the simple sheep.
The process was not to perfounde ne deep
Of their debate but contryued of a fable
Which of hem was to man most prouffytable
Each for his party proudely began proceed
To force him self by record of scripture
By philosophers as clerks seen and read
The prerogatyues / given hem by nature
Which of these three / to every creature
In republyca / avails most a man
For his party thus first the horse began
The horse.
To proceed bryefly and not long to tarry
Fryste for the trought that I do not err
What be is found in all thing so necessary
As is the horse both nyghe and far
And so notable to man in peace and war
Horse in chronicles who so redeth a right
Have saved often a many a worthy knight
Marcyall prowess in especyall
God has by horse give to warryours
Record of Alysaundre whose horse Bucyfall
Made him escape fro many sharp shours
The golden chare of old conquerours
Toward the tryumphe for knyghtly deeds
Conceived hit was with four white stedes
Remember Hector the troyan champyon
Whoos horse was called Whylom galathe
Upon whose back pleyed the lion
Full often sythes he made the Greeks flee
The stead of Perseus was called Pygase
With swyfte wings / peotes sayen the same
Was for his swyftnesse named the horse of fame
Eques ab equo is said of verry right
And chyualer is said of chyuatrye
In duche a rydder is called a knight
Aragon tongue does also specyfye
Caualoro / which in that party
Is named of worship and took beginning
Of spores of gold and chyefly of riding
These Emperors these princes and these kings
When they ben armed in bright plate and mayle
Without horse what were their mustrynges
Their broad baners or their rich apparayle
Tofore there enemies to show hem in battle
Without horse / spear / sword / ne shield
Might little avail for to hold a field
The hardy prykers upon horse back
Be sent to forne what ground is best to take
In their ordenaunce that there be no lack
By prouydence how they the field shall make
An horse will weep for his masters sake
Chactcer remembers the sword / ring / and glass
Presented were upon a stead of brass
Between two hills the prophet Zacharye
Saw stedes four / the first of hem was read
In chares four the field to magnefye
And the second was black it is no dread
The third was white body neck and head
The fourth diverse of colors / wonder strong
And to knyghthode all these colors long
The read horse was token of hardynesse
Which apperteyneth to every manly knight
The cole black hew a sign of soberness
Poraylle oppressyd to help in their right
The white milk stead that was glad of sight
Tokeneth yt knyghthode treuly should entende
Holy church maidens and wydowes to defend
The many fold colors to speak in general
Be sundry virtues and condycyons
As the four virtues called cardynall
Longing to knyghthode tencrece their renons
In re publyca / called the champyons
Trought to sustene and show hemselfe strong
Bound by order to see no man have wrong
Withouten horse Justes ne cournayll
May not behold in war ne in pees
Nor in palastee no plays martyall
If horse do fail may come to none encrees
Ne noman sothly dare put him in prees
Withouten horse for short conclusyon
To atteyne the palm of tryumphall guerdon
Lower degrees there ben of horse also
Do great prouffyte / to every comonte
The plough ne carte might naught do
Without horse / daily ye may see
Tyllynge were lost ne were we horses perde
The besy marchau^te to his advantage
Ner ships and horse could have no caryage
The ship by likeness is called an horse of tree
Full notably who can understand
To lead men and carye them over the sea
As done horse when they come to land
The poor man eke ledeth in a band
His little capull / his corn his mele to selle
And when hit is grou^den brings it fro ye melle
In winter season to make beall chere
The horse is needful wood and turf to carye
Wine fruit and oil to serve through the year
Is brought to vyneters and to potecarye
Diverse drugges and many a letuarye
Sundry bales and shortly all vytayll
Of the caryage horse have the trauayll
Heye ne otes plainly who list learn
May fro the feldes net the medes grene
To the garner neither to the berne
Without horse be carried hit is seen
And unto purpose. I say as I mean
There is no be rekene as I began
So necessary / as horse is unto man
Auguste is a season merry and glad
When every tree with new fruit is lade
With draught of horse the sheuys ben home lad
That month passed / the leeuys gyn to fade
Which made in somer a plesau^t lusty shade
What done horse than to speak in words pleyn
The second croppe they carye home of ryweyn
By draught of horse fro ryuers and wells
Bouges be brought to brewers for good ale
Led stone tymbre caryage of belles
We bring to chirches in trought this is no tale
We led clothe sackes and many a large male
And gladly summers be sent to forn
With gardeuyandes / how might horse be forborne
Ye prudent Iuges the egle and the lion
What I have said does wisely aduertyse
Weyeth this matter in your dyscrecyon
Where ghoos or sheep plainly to deuyse
Of their nature may in any wise
Justly deem ye / late hit not be spared
Unto an horse be lykened and compared
That I have told is tronght and no faynynge
No wight of reason again hit may apply
Ghoos ne gander ne grene gosselynge
But if they enter the bounds of envy
Let her come forth and say for her party
Ghoos yes trust me well for the I will not spare
Like as I feel my verdyte to declare
Where as thou haste unto thy pasture
But one place / to make in thy repair
Hit is granted to me by nature
To abide on water / land and eyer
Now among flowers and grenes that be fayer
Now bathe in ryuers swymme in many a ponde
For storm or shoure as dry as on the land
To mine intent mo things ye may seen
As men expert known that been old
When wild ghees hye in thayre up fleen
With their wings dysplayed and unfold
A pronostyque of snow and froste cold
Kalendes bring plainly for to say
Again winter how men should pourueye
The grees of ganders is good in medycyne
With sundry gommes tempred for the gout
Diverse aches to swayen and declyne
In thextremytee to draw the malice out
Feathers of ghees when they fall or moute
To gadre hem up herdes hem delight
To selle to fletchers the graye with the white
Men pluche stalks out of my wings tweyne
Some to portreye some to note or write
When Rethorycyens have do their besye pain
Fresshe epystles and lettres to endyte
Without writing avails not a myte
For if pens and writing were aweye
Of remembrance than were lost the keye
Of ghees also the deed is prouyd often
In many a contree and many a regyon
To make pylowes and fetherbeddes soft
Of prudence men plucken of the down
Thus to make a plain comparyson
As pylowes ben to chambres agreeable
So is hard straw lytter for the stable
The fyme of ghees and grene ghoselynges
Gadred in many among the herbs sote
Again brennynge scaldynge and other things
Tempred with oil or butter does both
To swage pain perceth to the rote
But horse dou^ge as refuse is cast away
Is good for furneys tempred with claye
A deed horse is but a foul carayne
Thayer Infectynge it is so corruptable
But a fat ghoos when hit is new slain
In dysshes of gold a mussell greable
Is served upon a hynges table
Swymmynge a live in watres crystallyne
Tenderly roasted requires to have wine
Through all the land of Brutes albion
For feathers arowes as I rehearse can
Ghoos is the best to make comparyson
Except feathers of pecok and of swan
Be bow and arowes sith the war began
Have English men remembered in storye
Of their enemies had many a vyctorye
Horse in the field may mustre with great pride
When they of trompettys here the blody sowun
But when an arowe has percyd his side
To ground he gooth and cast his master dowun
Entering the field he pleyeth the lion
What follows after / his carayne stynketh sore
Save skin and shone there leueth no more
Mighty captains and knights in the field
Make their wards in their ordenaunce
First men of arms with polax spear and shield
Set in order dew to have the governance
Which at peyters took the king of France
Thank to the ghoos most be given of right
Which in the field so proudely took her flight
Sloth of my flight for hasty neclygence
Of presumpcyon / the ghoos was left behind
When the famous and the worthy duke of clarence
Rode on Bayarde with his eyes blind
Flight of my feathers was put out of mind
And for he set that day of me no force
So little or naught what auayled him his horse
Books old remember well in sentence
Whylom when Rome by his foon was take
The Lapytole hepte of with great defense
Noise of a gander / the captain did wake
Which remembered / they set up for his sake
In their Temples wide and old
A large gandre forged all of fine gold
His waker noise was their sauacowne
By which the captain ran upon the wall
Thus by a gandre recovered was the town
Called of the world the cite most ryalle
Cite of cytees that day most pryncypalle
Was ever horse in book that ye can read
Pro re publyca / that did such a deed
In the book named of cheualrye destyne
The storye tells as in sentemente
There were childern of the ryall line
Born with chains / and when they were of rent
They turned to swannes by enchau^temente
Took their flight the trought is full clear
And as swannes they swamme in the ryuere
This storye is full autentyke and old
In frensshe compyled often red and seyn
Of thylke chains was made a cupe of gold
Which is yet kept as some folks seyn
And by dyscent hit longs in certain
To the hertordes ye shall so find in deed
Ceryously who so list the storye to read
And semblably / not long here to forn
I tell this tale as for my party
There was a man in lombardy born
To a ghoos ytorned by craft of sorcerye
And so abode seven year me list not to lie
His writ fill of / than stood he up a man
And bode in service with the duke of Melan
And for he was a man of high degree
Born of good blood and notable in substance
His kynrede gives a ghoos for their lyueree
The said marvel to put in remembrance
Peyse all things Justly in balau^ce
And let the horse leave his boost and roos
To make comparyson with gander or ghoos
Within Rome the gander was defye^d
Set in their Temples of great affection
By Senators of the town magnefyed
As chyef protector and sauer of the town
Let horse and sheep lay their boost a down
But if the Ram with his brazen belle
Can for the sheep some better storye tell
The Ram speaks for the sheep
The sheep was simple and loathe to make a fraye
Like a be dysposed to meekness
The sturdy Ram his advocate was that day
Tofore the Iuges he began him dress
With an exordye of latin he did express
Vest purpurea vt rectores regum
Induti sunt arietes ouium
Of this notable ryall hye scripture
The blessed doctor Augustyn as I read
Be a man goostly fair of figure
Of a meke sheep thus he does proceed
Called Maria a maid in thought and deed
Brought forth a lamb of most virtue
The lamb of grace whose name was Ihesu
Augustyn called this lamb in estate
By manyfolde record of scripture
The ryall lamb of color purpurate
Which for mankind list passion tendure
Borne of a maid by grace again nature
When he by mean of her humylyte
Took the clothing of our humanyte
Borne by dyscente to be both priest and king
King by succession fro Dauyd down by line
Of purpyll read was his ryall clothing
This agnus dei born of a pure virgyne
Which wysshe away all venyin serpentyne
On caluarye / when he for man was deed
With his pure blood purpurate and reed
This paschall lamb without spot all white
By his passion in Bosra steyned read
Which came from Edom this lamb of delight
That gaf his body to man in form of bread
On sherthursdaye tofore that he was deed
Was there ever found in scripture
Of horse or ghoos so solemn a figure
This lamb was christ that lyneally came
By dyscente conveyed de pee de gre
From the patryarke called Abraham
By Ysaac and Jacob so down to Yesse
Which by virtue of his humylyte
List to be called the blessed Ihesu
For his meekness the lamb of most virtue
And for to reherce worldely co^modytees
In re publyca / make no comparyson
There is no be / which in all degrees
Neither Tygre / Olyphant / ne Grysson
All things rekened through every regyon
Does so great prouffyte / horse / ghoos / ne swan
As does the sheep unto the ease of man
Lece be thy boost thou horse and thy Iangelynge
Lay down thy trappours forged of plate and mayle
Last of thy fadell of gold so fresshly shynynge
What may brydett or bores now avail
This goostly lamb has done a great battle
By his meekness he offered up for man
Clad in purpyll vaynquysshed has Satan
The ghoos may cakle the horse pryke and prau^ce
Neither of hem in process may atteyne
For to be set or put in remembrance
Again the lamb though they dysdeyne
For common prouffyt he passes both tweyne
Weye and consydere between poor and rythe
To him in valowe they be no thing lyche
Of Bruces albion his mulle is chyef richesse
In price surmou^tynge every other thing
Save grain and come merchants all express
Wulle is chyef tresoure in this land growing
To rich and poor this be find clothing
All nacyons afferme hit up to the fulle
In all the world is no better wulle
Of the sheep also comes pellet and the fell
Gadred in this land for great marchau^dyse
Carried over the sea where men may hit selle
The wulle skynnes causen men to rise
In to great richesse in many sundry wise
The sheep also tourneth to great prouffyte
To help of man hereth furs black and white
There is also made of the sherps skin
Pylches and gloves to drive away the cold
Thereof also is made good parchemyne
To write of books and quayers manyfolde
The Ram of Cholchos bare a flees of gold
The flees of Gedeon with dew delectable
Was of Maria a figure full notable
His flesh his natural restauracyon
As some men seen after great sickness
Roasted or soden holsom is moton
Boyleth with grewell / phesycyens express
Full nutrytyfe after great access
The sheep also concludynge doubteles
Of his nature loves rest and pees
Of the sheep is cast away no thing
His horn for nockes to hastes go his bone
To land great prouffyte does his tyrtelynge
His talowe served for plasters mo than one
For harp strenges his roppes serve echone
Of whose head boiled with wulle and all
There comes a gely and an oynement ryall
For the ache of bones and also for brosure
Hit remedyeth and does ease blyue
Causes men of stark Joints to recure
Deed senewes restores again to live
Black shepes wulle with oil olyue
These men of arms with charms preued good
At a strayt need can well straunce blood
Unto the wolf contrary of nature
As sayen auctours is this humble best
Loves no debate for which each creature
For his party he would live in rest
Wherefore ye Iuges I hold hit for the best
Rem publycam / ye should of right prefer(...)
Always considering yt peace is better than (...)
In this matter bryefly to conclude
Peace to prefer as to my deuyse
By many old provide symylytude
Make no delay / give the thepe the price
Of one assent sith that ye be wise
Let all war and strive be set a side
And upon peace do with the sheep abide
The horse.
Nay said the horse your request is wrong
All thing considered me were loath to err
The sheep is cause and has be full long
Of new stryues and of mortal werre
The circumstaunce me list not to defer
Thy wulle was cause and great occasyon
Why that the proud duke of Bourgon
Came tofore Calays with flemynges not a few
Which gaf the sackes and sarplers of the town
To Gau^t and Brugges his fredom for to show
Of thy wulles / he hight hem possessyon
His boustous bastyle first was beten down
Himself uneath escaped with the life
What / but thy wulles was cause of this strife
Were richesse is of wulles and such good
Men draw thither that been recheles
As souldyours that braynles be and wood
To get bagage they put hemselfe in prees
Thus causest you war / and say thou love pees
And if there were no war ne battle
Little or naught the great horse should avail
The ghoos.
No said the ghoos nor my feathers white
Without war should do none advantage
Ner hoked arowes prouffyte but a lyte
To mete our enemies magre their vysage
And from them to save us fro damage
Flight of feathers despyte of sheep echoone
Shall us defend again our mortal foone
The horse holding with the ghoos.
Soth quoth the horse as in my Inward sight
Without war before as I you told
We may not save / ne keep our right
Our garysouns ner castlellys old
But here this sheep ruchynge in his fold
Set little store of sword nor arowes kene
When he in peasmay pasture on the grene
If hit so stood that no war were
Lost were the craft of armorers
What should avail polar sword or spear
Or these daggers wrought by cu^tellers
Bows / crossebowes / arowes of fletchers
All these Instruments for the war is wrought
Is wars were stynt they should serve of naught
Their occupacyon should have none encreas
Knyghthode should not flower in his astate
In every contre if that there were peace
No men of arms should be fortunate
I preue that peace is ground of all debate
For in five spekes like as is a whele
Turned all the world who consydereth well
Begin first at peace which causes richesse
And richesse is thorygynall of pride
Pride causes for lack of ryghtwysnesse
War between reames look on every side
Hertes contrary in peace will not abide
Thus finally who can consydere and see
War is chyef ground and cause of pouertes
Hit is full hard to know any astate
Double vysage looks out of enery hood
Surete is lost Trust is paste the date
Thryfte has take his leave over the flood
Law can do no thing without good
Theeft has leave to go out at large
Of the commons myscule has take the charge
And thou desire thy self to auaunce
Poor or rich whether that thou be
Be lowely and gentle in thy governance
Good rule doubteles may best prefer the
If thou be gentle hurt not thy degree
And thou be poor do all that thou can
To use good manners for manner makes man
At thy mele be glad in contenaunce
In mere and dryke be thou mesurable
Beware of surfete and mysgouernaunce
They cause men often to be unreasonable
Suffer no thing be said at thy table
That any man may hurt or dysplease
For good mete and drink axeth Joy and ease
If thy goods to the not suffyse
Conform the ever to that thou haste
Govern so thy self in such a wise
In thyn expenses make no waste
Great excess causes vnthryft in haste
Beware betyme bear this in thyn heart
Mysrule makes often many men to smarte
Beware of nouellys that be new brought
Though they be plesau^t / lock fast thy lyppe
An hasty word may be to sore bought
Close thy mouth lest thy tongue tryppe
To thy self / look thou make not a whyppe
Hurt not thy self / lest thou sore rewe
For thyn own ease / hepe thy tongue in mewe
The world so wide the air so remuable
The sely man so little of stature
The grave and gounde of clotynge so mutable
The fire so hot and subtle of nature
The water never in one / what creature
That made is of these four thus flyttynge
May endure stable and persevere in abiding
The further I goo / the more behyndt
The more behind / the ner my ways end
The more I seche / the worse can I find
The lyghter leave / the lother for to wend
The truer I serve / the ferther out of mind
Though I go louse I am tied with a line
Is it fortune or Infortune thus I fine
