TO THE RIGHT Honorable the Lord Charles Haward Baron of Effingham, and Knight
of the most noble order of the Garter: Edward Hellowes wishes long life, with
the fullness of all perfect felicity.
RIght Noble, I not only directed by the glorious Gueuara in this example and
treatise which he dedicated unto a noble man of Spain, and in singular favor
with the Emperor Charles the fifte, but also constreyned with the oppression
and burden of your bounty, wanting all other mean either of ability or
faculty, to discover my dutiful affection, with the more boldness, not without
regard of the mildnes of your humanity, with an humble fear to be noted of
mine own part, of some presumption, or want of due consideration of any
imperfection of the matter, do present, respecting your age and honor annexed
unto the rare virtues of fortitude and temperance, with the experience of the
sea and sea matters, with ships and shipping, wherein approved trial, no
less worthy credit, has made known unto all persons not insensible: your
readiness and aptnes in all weathers, to manure not only the meanest matters, as
all manner of cordage and tackle within board, namely sheat, halliard, bowline,
tacke and helm, with such other, as also the use and practice of the
Astrolobe, Balistilio, Card and Compass: but also the diligent search in
knowledge, of all capes, forelands, shores, ports, creekes, havens, races,
tides, banks, and rocks. All which things although not usual to Noble men,
and yet most necessary unto all manner persons that haunteth the seas:
expresses kind to be an assured guide, to yield unto your honor more
expertnes then is common or easily obtained, to be heir and successor of
Neptunes charge and government. This small treatise, (as a subject in nature)
were it of worthiness sufficient, most due unto your honor: but barren
provision impayring my good meaning, forces me to present unto your honor,
the handful of water, (as it were) which was presented unto the mighty
Artaxerxes, who with such mildnes did accept the same, that he said no less
nobleness did consist in receiving small things, then to give great and
mighty gifts. Right humbly beseeching, that it may please your honor, not
only to receive this simple present in good part, but my sincere meaning into
your good favor: and I shall not cease with fortified mind to crave the
omnipotent GOD to give your Honor large and virtuous increase to the noblenes
of your mind, as also the concluding and most absolute felicity, which
yields happiness in all worlds.

Your Honors most humble to command: Edward Hellowes.

To the Reader.
RIGHT Christian Reader, dedicating my self unto thy good disposition, by this
small treatise, I give thee to understand, of the first and old invention, as
also the inuenters, chiefly of Galleys, as also of ships: by which device
we generally conceive all countries to obtain participation of each others
commodities: Sea fishing with the profits and nourishment thereof obtained: as
also the territories of diverse countries defended: with diverse and many such
others. Wherein of the other part, if I should allege the opinion of certain,
which affirm, that so unremovable bounds declares Gods omnipotent
ordinance, that every country so divided ought to content themselves to live,
by the gifts of the same God and country: and that Gods justice consents not
unto so great mischiefs, which both first and last ships and galleys not
only by murders and slaughters have been committed, but also by transporting
excessive vanities, aduauncing this worlds insolency, would not grow ouerlong
and tedious, but also somewhat besides the matter. But to the purpose, thou
have also (gentle Reader) herein to understand, the opinions of diverse
Philosophers, which in their own persons would never consent unto Navigations,
wherein as me seems they have discovered their own weakness, of al men to be
noted, but not of all persons to be embraced. Also the mighty and famous
Pirates of old time, to be meruailed how they might atteine unto so great power
and continuance: and in the end, unto so miserable destruction. Also privileges
somewhat strange which they use in Galleys, of all persons which mean to
haunt the same to be noted. Also the subtle disposition of the Sea, and
perilous properties thereof aptly declared. As also the necessary provision
for passengers, therein to be used. Farewell.

A Letter Missiue, or Dedicatorie of the Author, unto the renowned sir
Fraunces de la Cobos. (*)
AMongst the Philosophers, namely Mimus, Polystorus, Azuarchus, and Pericles,
there passed no small contention, and no less variety of argument, in the
definition, what estate or condition of men were most subject unto the
inconstancy of Fortune? and unto whom she discovered her self most
suspicious, and least worthy credit. The Philosopher Polystorus said that
Fortune was not in any thing more uncertain, and wherein she did less keep
promise, then in the act of matrimony: for so much as there had been no
marriage wherein there was not found some want, weakness, or deceit: which is
to say, that the wife proved either foolish, subtle, absolute, of tedious
parents, of dowry uncertain, full of strife, or such other infirmity. The
Philosopher Azuarchus held opinion, that Fortune was not more uncertain or
suspicious, then in the feate of arms, or martial affairs: affirming, that
it was in the hands of men to enter battle, but in God only to give victory.
The Philosopher Pericles affirmed, that Fortune was not in any thing more
inco^stant, or unsound, then with the private and favored servants of
Princes, with whom she staid long in aduauncing of them, and after with a blast
she overthrows them. The Philosopher Mimus avouched, that Fortune in any
thing did not more use her will, and less observe promise, then in sea matters
and Nauigatio^ of mariners: for there neither profits substance, or is
wisdom sufficient: either does she respect persons: but if Fortune fancy,
she leads a Lighter among the mounteines of the high seas, and after
drowneth a Carrecke in the haven. Applying that which is said, unto that which
I would say, me seems (right noble) that of these four manner of Fortunes,
two of them are knocking at your gates, which is to say, the possession of
great favor with our Caesar, and the often sailing which you use at sea. He
whose honor depends on the will of others, and many times commends his life
unto the sea, the one is very dangerous, and the other proceeds of great
rashness. Your honor performs no small attempt, to beard and make head against
the stu^bling blocks that Fortune bestows upon such, as she aduaunceth to
great honor, but that you also hurl and abandon your person so often into the
waves of so fierce seas? Publianus the Philosopher said, Improbe Neptunu^
accusat, qui iterum nanfragiu^ facit. As if he would have said, He unjustly
co^playneth of the sea, that two times passes the same: since he that only
twice passes the sea, has not license to complain thereof: then, by what
justice may he complain, that four times twice has provoked her fickle
condition? Always give not credit and yield not faith unto signs,
likelyhoods, or co^iectures, either for that always you are served with a good
gallie, or make your choice of a good captain, or special Pilot, or served
with most chief provision, and observe or watch most aptest time. All which
things give good cause the more doubtfully and with less surety to return
unto ye sea: for that flattering Fortune never shoots her so cruel shot, as
against such persons only as she has led many years in great security.
Lucius Seneca writing unto his mother, said: O my mother Albinia, if thou know
not, I give thee to understand, that I never gave credit unto whatsoever
Fortune did advertise me, although at times there was truce betwixt us: all
things which she sent unto my house, she said they were her absolute gifts,
but I never conceived or received them but as lent: by which mean it comes
to pass, that when she returns to demand them, without any altercation
willingly I do yield the^: in such wise, that if she remove them out of my
cofers, at the lest, she shall not tear them out of mine entrails. He that
said these and such like words, was native of Cordoua, which is not far
distant from your city of Vbeda: and further, he was as private with the
Emperor of Rome, as your honor is now in Spain: And after forty two years
that he had manured the common wealth of Rome, in ambushe Fortune had placed so
great mischief, procured by her great despite, and no less deceipte, that in
one day he lost both life and goods. Sir believe me and be out of doubt, that
in this life there is nothing more certain, then that, what soever it
conteyneth is most uncertain.

The Emperor Titus on a day eating with great joy, soudeinely at the table
clapped his hands and gave a great sighe, and being demanded, why he sighed so
deeply, made answer: I may not satisfy my self, with sighing, either
cease from weeping, so often as I call to remembrance how at the will and
pleasure of Fortune, my honor is committed, my goods sequestered, and my life
deposed. Oh high, and very high words, right worthy to be written in the
hearts of the mighty! Opulent riches, high estates, and sovereign favors, if
I durst say, I would say, that it is more honorable and also more safe to
despise and hold them in small estimation, then to possess them: because to
obtain them it is but fortune, but to contemn proceeds of valor. To give
you counsel to cease to follow Caesar, were of too great want of reverence: and
to persuade you, not to return into Italy, were rash ouerthwartnes: but that
which I dare say, is, that you should as much presume to be a Christian, as to
be in favor: and that first you accomplish with reason, and then with
opinion. Not without consideration, I did say and adventure my self to give
you this counsel: because all the mischief of Princes Courts does arise,
that nation follows nation, people follows people, and opinion follows
opinion: but reason never follows reason. And for that unto Princes we must
give our words by weight, and unto the favored by measure: my letter
concludes with this advertisement, that you commit trust unto ye Gallie but
sildom, but unto Fortune never: because they be matters much better to behold
far off then wherewith at hand to be conversant. I have composed unto your
honor a book, entitled, An advise for the favored, at times when you shall
be on land to peruse: and now have composed this other treatise of the life of
the Gallie: for when you shall pass the Seas, my intent has been, that the
one may serve to pass the time, and the other the profit of time. And if for
that I am of small power and less valor, you hold my watchings in small
estimation, yet my intent is not to be rejected: for that none does so much
desire, that you be in favor, as I desire that you be saved.

A TREATISE OF THE inuenters and invention of the Art of Navigations, and of
the travels of the Galleys. Compiled by the renowned sir Anthony of Gueuara
Bishop of Mondonnedo, Preacher, Chronicler, and Counselor unto the Emperor
Charles the fifte.
The Theme and Introduction follows.
To live in the Gallie at the Seas,
God dispose it to whom it shall please.
WHich words being taken for the foundation of this present treatise, are the
terms of an ancient proverb, which amongst the common people is greatly
used, and of such as escape the Galleys much lamented. That which we term in
Spanishe, Retrans: is said in Latin, Proverbs: in Greek, is understood,
Sentences: and in the Chaldean, is named Experiences: in such manner, that
Refrans, or Proverbs is no other thing, but certain Sentences of
Philosophers, and aduertisementes of men of experience.

In this manner and kind of proverbs, many ancient and learned persons have
written, That is to say: Xenophon the Thebane, Pittacus the Greek, Anacharsis
the Numidian, Solomon the Hebrew, Mythas the Egyptian, and Seneca the
Spaniard. Plutarche Cheronensis says, that he gave more credit unto poor
women's Proverbs, then to the sayings of the lofty Philosophers: for the one
never say but that which they have experimented, and the other do write very
often, that which they do but dream.

If Trogus Pompeius deceive us not, in the common wealth of the Sicyonians,
Philosophy was never read, neither did they ad^^t Philosophers, but commend
their warlike affairs unto valiant Capteines, and the government of their
Common wealth unto men of experience. The Sicyonians being demanded by King
Cyrus, who they did not admit Philosophers, or give themselves in Philosophy,
made answer: O King Cyrus, we give thee to understand, that this our country
is pair, and full of mounteines, and has more necessity of laborers and
plowmen, then of Philosophers. And further, we find by experience, that from
studies they proceed more vicious then Philosophers: for which cause, we
determine to govern our Common wealth by the experience which old men
possess, and not by the science which Philosophers do learn. That the
Sicyonians should utterly reject the learned, I condemn them for brutishe: but
jointly therewith, for their government, by men of experience, I commend them
as discreet: because for mine own part, and also for thine that shall either
hear or read this same, we shall be much better governed, by him that is of
two years experience, then by him that has ten of science. The Theme of
this our treatise which says:

To live in the Gallie at the Seas,
God dispose it to whom it shall please.
We may safely and without prejudice swear, that it was not invented by the
Philosophers of Athens, but by mariners at Sea: for which consideration, it is
great reason that we believe and give them credit, and hold it in estimation:
since the invention proceeds of matter well proved, and not dreamed or
diuined.

But the matter is, that in this treatise we shall speak of the original, and
first beginning, of the manner and making of Galleys, and what provision is to
be provided and used in them: all which things being said and declared, I am
assured that many will wonder, and some will laugh. All that we shall blazon
and say in this matter, our audience has to understand, not hearsay, but
experience does give us direction: for that scarcely there is not any port,
channel, or gulffe in all the Sea Mediterrane, but therein we have been,
having also passed no small danger. That which is said suffiseth for the
introduction, and there rests not, but that ye he attentive: for that he
goes to the Gallie in an evil hour, that takes not hold of this my
doctrine.

Of the strange report of Historiographers, concerning Galleys. The first
Chapter.
BEfore King Ninus, before the destruction of Troie, before the flood of
Can^ion, and before the great battle at Peloponnesus, although many and very
notable things were found and invented by curious men, and of delicate
judgment: yet we know not who were the inuenters, although their inventions
remain with us at these days: for that in those so ancient worlds, men
understood not to read, much less to write.

After that man's industry at leisure had found out letters, and the manner and
order of writing, we know every notable thing, from whence it was invented,
how it was invented, who was the inuenter, and wherefore it was invented.

Amongst all old things, one of the most ancient is the art of Navigations:
in which many have said many and variable things in their writings, wherein,
for so much as they have been so diverse and contrary in opinions: it is
very credible, that they were rather feigned, then either seen or read. But
that which we mean in this matter, is, that for such as are curious, we will
write curiously, that which in this art of Navigations, the most ancients have
written, as well Greeks as Latins: and it shall rest in the discretion of the
wise Reader, that he believe what he thinks to be true: and as touching the
rest, to hold it as fabulous.

And for that in this treatise our principal intent is, to speak of Galleys,
and of the inuenters and travels thereof, we shall here recite, how many
fashions of them were used in old time, amongst the ancients, as well
Greeks, Egyptians, Carthaginians, as also Romans.

Writers of histories do report, that Demosthenes the Thebane was the first
which invented to row with two oars on a bank: which was some what before
the siege of Troie.

Also they report, and the Greek Thucidides says no less, that a tyrant of
Corinth named Amonicles, was the first that invented Galleys, with three oars
on a bank.

The Gaditanes, and the Penes, have great contention betwixt themselves, for
the first invention of four oars on a bank. But Aristotle does rather yield
his opinion in the favor of ye Penes, who used that new invention, when they
came to succor the Lydians their friends and confederates.

The Gallie of five oars on a bank, is said to be the invention of the
Rhodians, when Demetrius did besiege them: and others give the glory of this
act unto Nasicus a renowned captain of King Cyrus.

The Gallie of six oars on a bank, Plutarche says was the invention of
Amonides the Lycaonian: but Thesiphont denies that it was the invention of
any, but of Xenagoras the Syracusan, in the days ye Nicias came from Greece to
subvert Syracusa.

The Gallie of seven oars on a bank, Pliny in a certain Epistle would give
us to understand, to be the invention of Nessegatus.

Pretonius a most ancient writer does afirme, the invention to apperteine
only unto Promotheus the Argiue: and yet others do say, that the singular
Alchimides in invention did find out the same: and which of these is true, he
knows that is only true.

Plutarche in the book of the Fortune of Alexander, would give us to
understand, that when Alexander the great did make an army at the Sea against
Diomedes the tyrant, he had a Gallie rigged and furnished with twelve oars on
a bank: although of truth he writes it so obscurely, that therein he
discovers his want, both in knowledge and exercise of Navigations.

If any will give credit unto Barbo^us Theneus, must hold it as verified,
that the great Ptolomeus which was named Philadelphus, attained to have four
thousand galleys of twenty oars on a bank, the shaftes all trimmed with lead,
to yield them pliant and handsome for rowing.

Th^s^phont, and Alercius, and also Hermogenes make mention of a certain
Gallie, made by the ancient Herisson of Syracusa: which had two forecastels,
and two p^pes, and under hatches, xxx. chambers, and a ponde of fish that
contained twenty thousand Canthars of water: adding thereunto so many other
strange things, that they rather seem Poetical, then otherwise.

Also it is said of Ptolomeus Philopater, that was king of Egypt, against
whom the good Machabeans did fight: that he made a Gallie of forty oars on
a bank, which was so stately to behold, and so hard to be governed, that it
contained more then four thousand oars, besides six hundredth mariners.

The son of this said Philopater, which also was named as his father, made
another Gallie, not so stately, either so costly, but more beautiful, and also
of greater devise and engine: wherewith in Summer he did solace upon the river
Nilus, and did winter the same in the Isle of Meroe.

After the terrible battle Pharsalian, where Pompeie was overcome of Caesar,
they say that Caius Caesar pursued and also did take a Gallie, that fledd from
that conflict of five oars on a bank, wherein there were so many trees with
fruit, as it had been an orchard of Campania.

Lucius Seneca, in a certain Epistle, reprehendeth Lucullus the Roman of a
certain curiosity, or to say better, a vanity: which is to say, that he made
a Gallie near unto his house of the Castle de Lobo, which was so large, that
therein they did not only chase the mad Bull, but also the Mariners gatt
infinite money, to give place unto multitudes of people to behold the same.

Dionysius the Syracusan, and Phocion being mortal enemies: Phocion caused a
Gallie to be made, wherein he, with his wife, children, servants, friends,
alies, and confederates, amounting to the number of six thousand and odd,
which in the day time came up the river, and at night did retire unto the Sea.

Of Aurelianus the Emperor his Chroniclers do recount, that after he
triumphed of the Queen Zenobia, he caused on the river Tiber such and so
great a Gallie to be made, that the largest parts of Tiber hardly might
contain the same: in the waste whereof there was room sufficient, with horses
to run the Carrera, as also to torney and just.

To say all the frivolous vanities that in this matter of Galleys is said and
written, would grow very large to be written, and tedious to be read: only
we will recite these few, to the end the readers may understand, that also
we have read, and thereof very little believed. In this Chapter following, we
will report the opinion of other history writers, as concerning the invention
of Galleys, the which in my opinion are more credible, and that which they have
written more to be credited.

Of the inuenters and users of Galleys, serving for Navigations, and of diverse
their deeds. The second Chapter.
THeseus the renowned Grecian, was the first that did change and alter the
great city of Athens, naming and creating therein Senators, and commanding
Palms to be given unto ye Conquerours: which custom endured until the time
of the Romans, who afterward devised to give their Conquerours triumphs.

This Theseus was he that entered the Labyrinth, and slew the Minotaure, and
gave an order to the people to live, as also unto their soldiers how to
fight: because he was a Prince of a clear and delicate judgment, and of a
valiant and noble mind.

This Theseus in a conquest, which he determined upon Rothana, which is a
country in Asia, of his own proper devise invented the first Gallie of this
world: which first devise atteined but unto thirty oars, and the mast of
xl. shaftments.

The Atheniens held this new devise in so great veneration, that their King
Theseus being dead, they placed the same within a temple, where long time
afterward it was kept and conserved.

Alcibiades was among the Greeks of noble blood, and of devise very
ingenious, although of him not very well employed: for that he naturally was
an enemy to quietness, and of great affection to innouations.

This Alcibiades did use much to say, that only for one thing, men ought to
travel in this life, which is to weete, to be famous amongst strangers, and
a Lord in honor amongst his vassals.

He being condemned to dye by the Atheniens, hearing the sentence, said: Not I
of them, but they of me are condemned to die: since I go to the Gods, with
whom none may die: and they remain amongst men, with whom none may live.

This unquiet Prince Alcibiades came unto the city of Syracusa of Trinacria,
with an hundred and thirty Galleys, thoroughly well rigged and furnished with
men and munition to destroy and subvert the same: for that he was advertised
they had armed a navy to chastise his insolent deeds done at Sea.

This Alcibiades was ye first that added other twenty oars unto the Galleys,
and unto the mast fifteen shaftments, and also of the Gallie he called the
forep^t Prora, and the hinder part Puppis.

Themistocles the Greek was a mortal enemy unto Aristides the Thebane, for
the death of the beautiful Aestigilia, whose death and injury, was of all the
people of Greece bewailed: and by the hands of right glorious Princes revenged.

Being demanded of a Greek, whether he had rather resemble the great
Achilles, that atchiued so great and many things, or the Poet Homere that did
write them with so high a style: thereunto Themistocles answered: I would
always rather triumph with Achilles, then proclaim with Homere.

Being demanded of his enemy Aristides, why he was so ambitious of wars,
since the attempters thereof (for the most part) did all perish therein,
answered: I confess, o Aristides, that many that are affectionate unto the
wars, do perish therein, but thou may not deny me, that very few
which are not dedicate thereunto, be crowned.

When he was requested, and also counseled to marry his daughter unto one
that was very rich, and no less covetous, he answered: I would rather have
a man that has need of money, then money that has need of a man.

The Atheniens being in great fear of the Cretensians, with whom they
trauersed cruel wars, but the more, for that they had Atheutides of Corinth
for their Captain: thereunto Themistocles answered: fear not Theutides, for I
know him, that if he have a sword to kill, he wants an heart to draw it
out of the scabberde.

This Themistocles did arm and rigge forth an hundred Galleys, against the
Agisinetes, who were pirates, all whom he did take and hang: which deed made
him in Greece to be served, and in the Seas to be feared.

This noble gentleman was the first that invented to place the forecastell,
where mariners might shroude themselves from the weather, and with more safety
fight with their enemies.

Simon, a famous Captain of all the Lycaonians, when his friends and parents
did sharply reprehend him, for leaving his study, and negligence in letters,
he answered: Brias my brother is meet for study, because he is flegmatike:
and I for the wars, since I am choleric: for that Philosophy agrees very
well with men that be dull and negligent, and war is to he commended unto men
of lively and entermedling Spirits.

When in the Senate of Athens they argued in his presence, whether were more
safe to have a good Captain and a weak army: or a strong army governed with
a weak Captain, he answered: For my purpose, I had rather have an army of
Hearts, a Lion being their Captain: then an army of Lions, being governed by
an Heart.

Being bound unto the conquest of a certain people of the greater Asia, and
also persuaded of a Captain to send for the Agisinetes, who did know very
well to die, he answered: The Gods never command, either my destinies permit,
that any such people should march in mine army: for in the wars we have no
need of men that know to dye, but have courage to kill.

This Simon was the first that gave order in the Gallie to row with three
oars on every bank: and first invented also the misen sail.

He obtained an hundred Galleys to his own proper use, of whom Plutarche
says, that he so vowed him self unto the Sea, that he passed three years, in
all which time he never set his foot on land.

King Demetrius, who was son unto King Antigonus, as he had success with
Fortune, so did he order his life: which is to weete, in time of peace he
would suffer nothing that might be tedious: and in time of war, he admitted
nothing that might be pleasant.

If King Demetrius had been aunswerable in his old age, to the beginnings of
his youth, he had been another Achilles amongst the Greeks: and another
Caesar amongst the Romans.

His father King Antigonus being dead, although he always followed the wars
that he had enterprised, and the parcialities which he had taken in hand, on
the other part he was so inconstant of his word and promise, and so
effeminate in his factes, that to follow his love Lamia, he suffered detriment
in his fame, was abhorred of all Greece.

King Demetrius being demanded, why in his youth he had been so prosperous,
and in his old years so unfortunate, answered: Because I was an enemy to
reason, and gave overmuch trust unto Fortune.

In great conflicts and perils, many times sighing he did use to say: O
deceiptfull Fortune? how easy art thou to be found, but how difficil to be
kept?

Being blamed by his familiar friend, for his often murmuring at Fortune, by
whom he had obtained so many victories, and was endued with so many gifts:
he answered: Oh, how great reason have I to complain of Fortune? which with
victories has made me a fool, and with adversities has not rendered my wit.

This King Demetrius always delighted to have a great fleet at Sea: and was
the first that invented Galleys with xxv. banks: amongst the rest, he made a
bastard Gallie, which was furnished with four hundred oars, and contained
two thousand armed men.

Philopater the Thebane, although nature had made him lame on one foot, and
squint in one of his eyes, yet his great and doughtie acts were such, and so
renowned, that he was entitled throughout all Greece, Philopater the just, for
his good government: and, Philopater the fortunate, for the victories which
he obtained.

A certain Captain named Aristo, thwarting Philopater with words of
reproach, that his lame foot in the wars did rather serve him to stumble,
then to fight: Philopater answered: O Aristo, I confess unto thee, that to go
to ye wars, is a matter much more safe for thee then for me for unto thee
there wants an heart to fight, and yet have thou feet to fly: but unto me
there wants feet to escape by flight, but no heart or courage to endure all
conflicts and hazardes.

This Philopater was much and long time at Sea: and being demanded, if he were
not at some times afeard, he answered: We that go to Sea, are but only once
afearde: and that is on land, before we enter the Sea: for after we be entered
and determined, then we hold it for most certain, that at the mercy of a
proud and lofty wave of the Sea, a sandy bank, or a ragged rock, we lead
our lives to be sold.

This philopater came from Asia to conquer Rhodes with an hundred Galleys, all
rowing with seven oars on a bank: certainly, a thing very monstrous to
behold, and no less difficult to sustain.

Many Princes both Greeks and Latins did imitate philopater in making
galleys with seven oars on a bank: all which did perish, and had an end:
and in the end of many experiences practiced in Galleys, they resumed in
general, that the good Gallie is not to be more then of five oars on a bank,
either less then three.

The renowned Cleopatra sometimes Queen of Egypt, and only love unto Mark
Antonie, (which love cost him his life, and her both life and honor:) when
she passed from Egypt unto Gracia, to encounter with Caius Casar, the oars
of her Gallie were of silver, her anchors of gold, her sails of silk, the
ppooe of Marfile entailed.

Behold here the inuenters of Galleys, and also their inventions, wherein, to
this day, Seamen have always somewhat to be amended, and no less to be
added.

Of the first invention of Navigations, and the great dangers thereof, and of
many philosophers that would never sail or pass the Seas. The third Chapter.
IF we should believe Isidorus in his Etymologies, the Lydians were the first
that invented the art of Navigations, who attained not, but to the joining of
certain beams or logs, which being fastened and calfated, they entered into
the Sea, fishing therein: not with courage sufficient to wander far from
land.

After the Lydians, the Sidonians were the first that added their invention of
certain baskettes made with Willowe rods, skins, canes, and ciment,
wherein they did not only venture to fish, but also to sail somewhat further
into the Sea.

Long time after this, the Islanders of Choronta brought forth the invention
of mean Barks: and also of little ships made only without all other matter
but of timber.

All writers of histories do agree, that somewhat before the battle at
Maratho, Epaminondas the Greek, did finishe to place in perfection the manner
of sailing, and the form to make ships: for in the Peloponnesian wars,
the renowned Captain Brias was present, with ships, Carreckes, and Galleys:
but be it as be may, and the invention to whom it apperteineth: for many times
I stay to consider, how lothesome it was unto the first man, that being safe
on land, would committ him self unto that waterie Element, and unto the waves
and pillars of the Sea, since there is no sailing so sure, wherein betwixt life
and death is contained more then a boorde.

As me seems, exceeding covetousness, and want of wisdom, did join hands
in the devise and art of Navigations: since we see by experience, that for men
not infected with covetousness, and endued with peaceable disposition, there
is no land in this world so miserable, which stretches not to serve the
necessity of man's life.

Herein it is seen, how man is much more brutish then all other beasts,
since all beasts do fly, for no other cause, but for fear of death, pressed
by nature to conserve that life which is given, and may not be had, but only
by divine gift: only man, being captive unto covetousness, saileth, and
goes to the Sea.

But thou, O Mariner, give me to understand, if for the salvation of thy
soul, or conversation of life, any safe matter may be found at the Sea?

What thing is contrary unto us on land, which is not much more on Sea? On
land we are vexed with hunger, cold, thirste, heat, agues, sorrows,
enemies, misfortunes and angers, all which things do yield double and
treble vexation unto men at Sea.

And besides all this, the sorrowful sailer stands at the mercy of the
wind, to be overthrown, and of the terrible waves to be drowned.

I neither lie, or repent my self to say, that if covetousness did not
tyrannize man's heart, there would no fleetes remain on Sea: for that is the
only cause that does alter their hearts, draws them from their houses,
yeldeth them vain hopes, places in them new strengths, banisheth them from
their countries, makes them towers of wind, depriueth them of their
quietness, leads them wandering out of their wits, carries them sold
unto the Sea, and also teareth them in a thousand pieces on the rocks.

The Philosopher Aristo said, that he died twice, that died on Sea: that is to
say, first his heart was drowned in covetousness, and after his body in the
water.

Certeinely, a sentence right worthy to be noted, and to memory to be
commended: since God has not created man to dwell in the Seas, but to inhabit
the heavens.

The Consul Fabatus, in three score years, which he lived, he never passed
out of his city Rhegio, to see the city of Mesana: which was distant by water
but nine miles, and being demanded in this case, why? he answered: The
ship is foolish, and uncertain: for she never stands still. The Mariner
is foolish, and uncertain: which is never of one judgment. The water is
foolish, and uncertain: for she never ceasseth her unquietness. The wind
is foolish, and uncertain: which in her flight is so variable. And since
this is so true, that shuning but one fool on land, how would thou that I
should commend my life unto four fools on Sea?

From a clear judgment, of a man of experience, of a wise Philosopher, and of
a man of great sapience, was this answer of the Consul Fabatus: for if we
profoundly consider the furious importunity of the Air, the rage and swelling
of the Sea, the inconstancy of the ship, the tedious travel of the Mariner,
and the discomfortable voyage of the passenger, as God shall save me, and so
never more, let me return to Sea, if all that willingly go to Sea in
ships, deserve not most justly to be bound as distraught fools.

What portion of wisdom may he contain, which lives in the Gallie? What
thing may thou more justly sing in the Gallie, then that response or answer
of the dead, which says: Memento mei, Deus, quia ventus est vita mea.

Is not wind perchance thy life? since thy chiefest business in the Gallie,
is to talk of the wind, to behold the wind, to wish for wind, to tarry
for wind, to fly the wind, or sail with the wind?

Is wind perchance not thy life, that if it be contrary, thou may not go
thy voyage: if it blow extreme, although large, yet must thou amain: if it
be calm, then must thou row: if it be a tempest, then must thou hale, or try
for thy life: and if it blow from land, then must thou not believe it: in such
wise, that it shall be no false witness to say, The wind be thy guide, since
thy fortunate or unfortunate life consists in the wind.

There is no man on land, be he never so poor, that in a great necessity
obteineth not money to yield him self relief: or children, to serve him: or
friends, to succor unto: or parents, to restore him: or assistantes, by
whom to be supported: or neighbors, in whom to put his trust: Except the
miserable person that goes in the Gallie, who has placed his life at the
judgment of a foolish Pilot, and of a contrary wind.

Plutarche reports of the Philosopher Att^lus, who dwelling in the city of
Sparta, through the midds whereof ran a great river, would never pass the
same, to view the rest of the city all the days of his life: affirming, that
the air was made for birds, the land for men, and the water for fish. It is
said, that this Philosopher ieasting used to say: When I shall see fishes
walk on land, then will I go sailing at Sea.

Alcimenus lived ninety years amongst the Epyrotes, unto whom was left a
certain inheritance, which he would never accept, or as much as view the
same, for that it lay on the other side of the river Marathon: affirming it to
be a miserable inheritance, the profit whereof must be conveyed by water.

Marcus Portius Censorine, at the point of death, said, that in his life he had
offended the Gods but three manner of ways, which is to say: for that there
had passed one day, wherein he had committed no virtuous act in the Common
wealth: for that he had discovered a secreat of importance, unto a woman: and
for that, when he might have traveled on land, he sailed as a passenger on
Sea.

Cropilus Philosopher and disciple of Plato, commanded the windows of his
house that were toward the Sea, to be dammed up. The question being
demanded, why? he answered: To escape all delight to enter therein: for my
master Plato did often use to say: That sailing at Sea was rather the exercise
of fools, then of Philosophers.

Titus Liuius says, that his Roman people were not more happy on land, then
unfortunate on Sea^ for which cause the ancient Romans never consented to
make or send forth Galleys or Nauies, from the time of the good Camillus,
unto the birth of the great Scipio.

When the Senate of Rome determined to make conquest of Asia, and to the same
effect commanded the Consul Cneius Fabricius to provide a great navy: with a
loud voice the Consul Fabius Torquatus exclamed: all men that hear me, and
the Gods that see me, I call to witness, that I am not, or do consent, unto
this counsel, which is to we to: that the fame and glory that our mother
Rome has obtained by land, ye should committ unto fierce waves of the Sea:
because, to fight with men, is but Fortune: but to deal with winds, is great
foolishness.

Wherefore, the word of my Theme, seem to be well said, which is:

To live in the Gallie at the Seas,
God dispose it to whom it shall please.
Of many and very famous Pirates which have lived on Sea. The fourth Chapter.
SPeaking with truth, and also with liberty, sailing in the Gallie along
the coasts, is somewhat more safe, but in no less danger, being ingulffed.
Whereof it may very well be gathered: that Galleys were rather invented to
rob, then for navigations.

Before the Greek Theseus invented the making of Galleys, it is not found in
any history that ye Sea was haunted with any Pyrate or robber: but since the
making of Galleys, there has never wanted that has descended to sack towns,
and also to rob at the maine Sea.

If I be not deceived, the end wherefore any man makes a Gallie, is either to
defend his own country, or else to offend strangers.

And as the Gallie is both tedious, and also costly, so I think not that any
man imployeth therein his own proper goods, but that he supposes to sustain
the same by other means substance.

And as there: have been many excellent persons, which have been renowned by
the conquest of countries, and subduing of people, by land: So have there been
many much feared, and famous, for their robberies, which they have committed on
Sea.

The famous Pirates of old time, have been many: but amongst the rest, the
most r^^^ wined was Dionides in the reign of Alexander: Aeste^^, in the days
of Demetrius: Cleonidas, in the time Ptolomeus: Chipandus, in the government
of Cyrus: Miltas, in the rule of Dionysius: Alcamenus, in the alteration if the
estate committed by Caius Caesar: and Agathocles, in the happy years of the
good Augustus.

To make an ^^ire report of the beginning^ which these Pirates had, the
robberies they did, the perils they passed, the men murdered, the towns they
subverted, the cruelties they committed, the wealth they obtained, the ends
they made, and the Fortunes wherein they finished, would grow very large to
report, and tedious to read.

For the present, it shall be sufficient to say, that none of these Pirates dyed
in their beds, either made a will of their goods: but the hour being come of
their sorrowful destinies, they quited the mischiefs they had committed, and
did not enjoy the riches which by robbery they atteined.

And because it shall not seem, that we speak at large, or of favor,
somewhat we will say of them.

Dionides was Pyrate in the Leuant Seas, in the reign of Alexander and Darius,
which would neither serve she one, or make peace with the other: but without
respect of any person, made good price and hauoke of all things.

Against this Dionides, Alexander commanded a great fleet or navy of
ships to be rigged: who being taken, and brought before his presence,
Alexander said: Tell me Dionides, why have thou escandalized the whole Sea?
Who aunswering, said: Wherefore have thou sackte the whole earth, and robbed
all the Sea? Alexander answered, because I am a King, but thou a Pyrate.
Whereunto Dionides replied: O Alexander, we are both of one condition and
office, but that they term me a Pyrate, because I affaile with a small army:
and thou art entitled a Prince, because thou robbest with a great Navy. O
that the Gods would grow mild with me, and Fortune cruel against thee, in
such wise, that Dionides might be Alexander, and Alexander turn to be
Dionides: it might happen me to be a better Prince then thou, and thou a
worsse Pyrate then I.

Aestelio was a Pyrate sixteen years on the Adriatike Seas, in which he
committed great robberies upon the Bactries, and did great hurtes unto them of
Rhodes. Against this Pyrate King Demetrius caused a certain fleet of ships
to be rigged and launched: who being taken, and brought before his presence,
was demanded: Aestelio, what offense have the inhabitants of Rhodes done
against thee, that thou have so robbed them? and the Bactries, that thou have
so subverted them? Who answered: Tell me Demetrius, what had my father done
against thee, that thou should command him to be slain? And, what offense
had I committed against thee, that thou should command me to be banished? I
counsel thee, O Demetrius, in this last and extreme hour, that thou persecute
no man to the uttermost: because it is not a little perilous, to deal
extremely with any man that has lost his honor, and is of desperate life.

Cleonidas was a Pyrate in the days of King Ptolomeus, who continued in that
estate, traversing the Seas xxii. years, of which he was never seen in seven
years, to set his foot out of the Gallie.

This Cleonidas was lame and crooked, whom Nature had not marked in vain: for
he was most cruel with such as he had taken, and with any observed no truth.

The enemies whom this wretched Pyrate recovered into his hands, amongst
other torments which he gave them, their hands and feet being bound, he did
fear them with ladels of hot oil.

Against this Pyrate King Ptolomeus commanded a fleet of ships to be set
forth, who being taken, and brought before his presence, the King said unto
him: What barbarous inhumanitie, or rather, what infernal fury has taught
thee torments never heard of, to be practiced upon men like thy self?

Whereunto Cleonidas answered: I will not only torment mine enemies in their
bodies, wherewith they did persecute me, but also burn their entraile^
wherewith they did hate me. King Ptolomeus commanded this Pyrate Cleonidas
daily to be scalded with hot oil, to increase his pain, by enlarging of his
life.

The Pyrate Chipandas was native of Thebes, which did concur with the days
of King Cyrus, and was a person valiant, liberal, and of great power: for he
obtained to possess an hundred Galleys, and thirty ships, where with he
forced service of all the Kingdoms of the East, and terrified all the Princes
of the West.

Against this Chipandas King Cyrus commanded a great navy of ships to be
rigged forth: who being taken and brought into the kings presence, said unto
him: Thou Chipandas, receiving my wages, why wentest thou to serve the king of
Parthians? Who answering said: The laws which are made on land, bind not
such as go to sail and live at Sea: and such as we use on Sea, are not
observed on land: which I say, for that it is a custom amongst us Pirates,
that weee as often change our Master, as the wind changes on Sea.

Miltas, the Pyrate, was in the days of the first Dionysius of Syracus^, who
were great enemies, and striued, not for the souereigntie in virtue, but who
should obtain the highest degree in vice and wickedness: for that Dionysius
subverted all Sicilia, and Miltas sacked all Asia. This Pyrate Miltas trauersed
the Seas of Asia more then thirty years, in the end the inhabitauntes of
Rhodes armed certain ships against him, who being taken and brought unto
the place of execution, life up his eyes to heaven, and said: O Neptune, the
God of Seas, why do thou not help me at this instant? since I have
sacrificed within thy Seas, five hundred men, whose throtes I did cut with mine
own hands: forty thousand I cast over boorde, and thirty thousand that
have died of diseases, and also twenty thousand which have perished fighting
in my Galleys. Is it now possible, that I which have slain so many, should
now be slain of one only man?

Alcamenus was Pyrate in the time of Silla and Marius, who followed the
parcialitie of Silla: And as Caius Caesar fled from Silla, he was taken by
Alcamenus, unto whom ieasting he did use to say, That he would get loose, and
hang them all. And after, when Caius Caesar saw him self Lord of the Common
wealth, presently he commanded a great fleet to be armed and rigged against
Alcamenus, who being taken and brought to the place of execution, said: It
grieueth me not of all that which I have lost, or of the death^ which I shall
dye: but to fall into his hands, whom I had in my possession: and that he
should command me to be hanged, whom I might, and should have hanged.

As we have said of these few Pirates: we might say also of others of great
antiquity, and also of later time. But it suffices, that,

To live in the Gallie at the Seas,
God dispose it to whom it shall please.
Of many and great privileges which they have in Galleys. The fifte Chapter.
SInce we have spoken of the foundation and beginning of Galleys, and of the
notable persons that were enemies of Navigations, and also of the most famous
Pirates that vowed themselves to theft: we will now say somewhat of the
notable conditions of Galleys, and of the great privileges wherewith they are
priuileged.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all manner persons which shall enter
therein, must always sail very suspicious of Pirates that shall take them,
and no less timorous of the cruel Seas that shall drown them: for there is
no Sea so safe, wherein wandereth not some notable Pyrate: or absome time
rises not some cruel storm.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that for all men which shall enter and sail
therein, before all things, must lose all liberty of commandment, and
jointly therewith, both Captain, Patron, and all the whole ^roope of Mariners
he must obey: and if he will there any thing presume of that which he has, and
of his value and worthiness, the most poor Rower shall say unto him, that
presently he be packing out of the Gallie, and go to command at home in his
house, in an evil hour.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, whether she be of her own condition, either
straight or large, and of oars much pestered, and no less cumbred with other
carriage: the passenger that shall enter therein may hold it for an advise,
only to lean where he may, and not to sit down at his pleasure.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that the passenger which shall enter therein,
be he never so worshipful, rich, or stately, must call the Captain,
Seigniour: the Patron, Cousin: the Boteswane, friend: and the pages of the
Squiffe, brethren: and the rowers, companions. The cause proceeds, that the
passenger in the Gallie wanting all liberty, has there of all persons
necessity.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all manner of persons, which there will
enter or pass, must be humble of conversation, patient in their speech,
dissembling in their necessities, and of much suffering in injuries: for that
in Galleys, it is a thing more natural to suffer injuries, then either to do
or revenge them.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all persons which there do enter, shall
want the conversation of women, of deintie diet, of fragrant wines, of
comfortable and sweet smelles, of cold waters, and such other delicacies: all
which things they shall have licenes to desire, but no faculty to obtain.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all manner persons which there do enter,
shall eat ordinary biske^ with a condition, that it shall be covered with
Tapestrie of Cobwebs, black, worm eaten, ratt eaten, and also wett either
more or less. And also I advise the squint eyed passenger, that if he be not
handsome, redily to take it out of the water: I bid him to an evil feast.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if at any time, by descending on land,
the passenger shall obtain any small parcel of bread, that is new, white,
and well seasoned, that he adventure not to feed of it him self alone, but to
make division thereof amongst his companions: and it shall happen, that he
alone being the only buyer, shall obtain so much unto his share, as may serve
for a piece of holy bread.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that no man at dinner time, shall there
demand water that is either clear, cold, whoalsome, or sweet: but of force
must content him self to drink troubled, gross, warm, and unsavory water:
yet is it no less true, that unto such as be very nice, the Captain gives
license, that all the while they shall be a drinking, with the one hand they may
stop their nose, and with the other hand lift the pott unto their head.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if any passenger betwixt meals would
drink a little, refreshe his face, or wash his mouth or hands: the water
which he therefore needs, he must either crave it of the Captain, or bribe
the Steward, bring it from land, or buy it of some Rower: for in the Gallie
there is nothing more desired, and whereof is less abundance, then water.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that no passenger shall presume to shed water
in the poope, or much less adventure to spitt therein. And he that shall
herein be negligent or careless, the Captain shall chide him, and the
sweepers for a penalty shall receive six pence: in such wise we control no
Mariners for spitting in our Church, and they make us pay a tribute for
spitting in their poope.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that the flesh which they ordinarily shall
eat, is joints of Goats, quarters of Sheep, salt Beef, and rustie Bacon, not
boiled, but parboilde: not roasted, but burnt: in such wise, that being set on
table, it is lothesome to behold, hard as the devil to gnawe on, salt as
broyne to feed on, and indigestible as a stone.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if the passenger will eat any Mutton,
Beef, or Kidd that is fresh, he must either buy it of the soldiers which
have stolen it, or adventure on land for it. And when he has all done, is it
true that he shall enjoy it? No, truly: but he that shall flay off the skin,
of right must have the skin, the entrails, and a quarter: and after, with
the flesh which remains, he shall be charged with rosting and boiling, and
commonly at large, with all persons to eat it.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that any person that would eat boiled meat,
he must steal, bribe, or buy, and in time provide a pott: which after he has
gotten, he him self must wash it, dress it, scumme it, and also watch it:
and to remove from thence for no cause: for if otherwise, but with the turning
of his head, another shall eat his boiled meat, and he shall be left to make
report of the jest.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that he never stay to dress his meat until
he have an appetite, but when he may: for, as the pottes, pipkins, morters,
caldrons, kettels, spittes, and grateyrons do compass the hearth, the passenger
shall go and come, as one poar-blinde: if first he have not recovered
friendship with the Cook or Steward.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that the passenger yt will there feed in
platters, with spoones, upon trenchers, and with sawcers, that first thereof he
make provision for him self, or bribe the steward, or hire them of some rower:
and if he happen to be careless to provide them, or negligent to procure them,
the Captain will friendly give him license, to cut his meat upon a boorde,
and suppe his potage out of the pott.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if any passenger would eat with
gravity, that is to say, with clean napkins, large towels, and table clothes,
he must bring them not only all ready bought, but as well kept: for a
merchandise so cleanly, is seeldome found in Gallie: and if in this, as in the
rest, he be forgetful, he may with a safe conscience, as also with shame
enough, wipe on his shirte, and now and then on his beard.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that therein is no bench to lie on, no stool
to repose on, no window to lean on, neither boorde to feed on: but jointly
therewith, that license which they give unto the passenger which is dim
sighted, that hard by the hearth, he may eat on the floor as a More: or upon
his knees, as a woman.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that every passenger, rower, mariner,
servant, ecclesiastical, gentleman, or knight, may with a safe conscience,
break his fast without grieve Figs, without Cherries: a beauer without
Apricockes: a supper without Cream: and make collation after supper without
green Almonds. If of these and such other refreshings, he shall happen to have
some appetite, or taken with an extreme lust: he shall have time sufficient to
sigh: but all place and opportunity wanting that should obtain the same.

Of other twenty travels that are in the Galleys. The sixte Chapter.
IT is a privilege of the Gallie, that on the day in which sailing ye shall
pass a gulffe, or that soudenly any tempest do arrise, they kindle no fire,
they dress no meat, and that all passengers go under hatches: because to
raise the mast, it is necessary that the Gallie be free, clear, and not
pestered: and it is most true, at that instant and conflict, the confusion,
noise, and cries of the mariners gives more terror, then the rage and fury
of the Sea.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all passengers which be Christians, and
have the fear of God, at the passage of any gulffe, or any other danger,
commend them selves unto God, repent them of their sins, reconcile them
selves with God and man, and make some vows: all which things, and much more,
is done at Sea: and after on land, silde or never, is accomplished.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that when the Sea does go aloft, the wind
contrary, or any furious tempest assail, the Mariners are accustomed
presently to bring home their anchore, they take in their Squiffe, take down
their hale, and uncover the poope: then, woe be unto thee, thou poor passenger,
because thou shalt remain at the mercy of the Sun which shines, and to
receive all water that shall rain.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that as often as the wind changes, so often
the sail is altered, and if it blow much wind, they strike sail: and if it
be more calm, they hoysse sail. And that wherein the passenger has most to
employ him self, is to lift up his eyes unto the foresaile, lay his hands
unto the rope, and occupy his heart in the torment: for in the Gallie at Sea,
there is no greater sign of danger of life, then when the Mariners do often
hoysse and strike the foresaile.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that no man presume to crave either feelde
bed, sheets of Holland, pillowes of down, or Moriscoquilts: but jointly
herewith, if the passenger be delicate, or be acrazed, the patron will give
him license, to sleep upon a boorde: and for a pillowe, to lay his head upon
a Target.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that no man, be he never so woorshipfull, may
obtain a place assigned to walk in, or else to retire, neither at all times
when he would to sit down: if any man desire, in the day time, to be
sometimes in the poope, and to sleep on nights in some room of Crossebowe
shot, he must first buy it of the Captain by force of praying, and obtain
it of the Boteswane for good money.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if any man need to warm water, to make
lee, or drive a buck, to wash his shirte, that he care not to attempt or to
remember the same: but if he will be occasion for some to laughe, and others to
scoff and deride: But if his shirte be somewhat foul or sweatie, and has no
change, forceably he must have patience, until he go on land, or by
rottenness to finish the same.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if any nice or curious passenger will
needs wash any handkerchife, headkerchife, towell, or any shirte for his own
person, that it be in no fresh or sweet, but salt water. And as the salt
water does breed ytch and scurffe, so the Captain will give him license, and
the Boteswane will allow him place to rub his back against the Mast, or
seek a Rower to scratch the same.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that no passenger shall be bound, or as much
as to adventure to pull off either hose or shoes, doublet, coat, or cloak,
when he goes to sleep: because the poor passenger has allowance of no
better bed in all the Gallie, then the garments which he shall wear.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that the beds which there are made for
passengers and Rowers, have no appointed head or feet, but that they lie down,
where they may, and as it shall chance, and not as they would: which is to
weete, that the one night, where they shall lay their heads, the next night to
place their feet. And if by chance his companion have eaten Chestnuttes, or
supped with Radishe, and so shall let fly, you understand me what: Good
friend, thou must make thy reckoning, that thou did dream it, and never
report that ever thou heardest it.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all fleas that leap upon the hatches,
and all lice that breed in seames, and all cheslockes that walk in chinkers,
be common unto all men, and be divided and parted amongst all men: and if any
person which is fine and nice, shall appeal from this privilege: from
thencefoorth I prophecy, that if he make but a secret inquiry, in his neck
and bosom, and a privy search in his breeches, he shall find more lice,
then money in his pursse.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all the Rattes, and Wezels therein, both
dare and have liberty, when they may, without any penalty, to steal from
passengers, napkins, and fine Sendall, silk girdles, old shirtes, fine
Coyffes, and also perfumed gloves: And all the same to hide to sleep in, to
breed in, and to bring up their young ones, and also to gnawe on when they
want meat. And brother passenger, marvel not when thou feel, that sometime
they do bite thee: for that when I passed betwixt Tunes and Sicil, they did at
one time bite me by the leg, and another time by the ear: and as I had
sworn to the privileges of the Gallie, I made no boast thereof.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that the bread, the cheese, the wine the
bacon, the flesh and fish which thou shall prepare for thy provision, thou
must give thereof unto the Captain, Boteswane, Pylott, Mariners, and to him
that is at helm. And as concerning that which remains, hold it for
certain, the dogs will have a catch, the Cattes will have a snatche, the
Rattes will gnawe, the Stewards will tithe, and the Rowers will steal: in such
wise, that if thou be a little dim sighted, and not very well advised, the
provision which thou made for a Month, will hardly last thee ten days.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if the Billowe do somewhat roll, or the
tempest rise, or the Gallie passing some race, thy heart will be dismaide, thy
head grow idle, thy stomache wamble, thine eyes wax dim, thou beginnest to
belche, and discharge thy stomache of all which thou have eaten, and also ly
down upon the hatches: and think not that any of the beholders will hold
thy head, or cherrishe thee with a cawdle: but they all at deaths door with
laughing will say, it is nothing, but that the Sea will make a proof of thee:
thou being at point of thy last gasp, and also in utter desperation.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if any passenger will at some time
refreshe him self on land, recover a Can of water, or seek or buy fresh
victuals, or with others strike an hand, as a Friar, he must ask leave of
the Captain, and entreat the Boateswane to arm the Squiffe: he must flatter
the pages to set him on land, and promise them somewhat to tarry for him:
and give money unto him that upon his shoulders shall carry him out of the
water: And if for the wickedness of his sins, he be not ready to embarke
at the first sound of the retreat, the Gallie shall make sail, and he shall
remain on land to be hanged by the Justice.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that every passenger yt will purge his
belly, is forced to ye common places of the forecastell: or else to climb and
stay by some loope hole for the Crossebowes: and that which may not be said,
much less done without shame, all men may so openly behold him, sitting at
his necessities, as if he sat banqueting at the table.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that no man presume to crave to drink in
plate, in glass of Venice, or pitcher of Barcelona, or nutt of the Indies: in
such a case, if the passenger have not provided a cup or pitcher, wherein to
drink, the Captain will dispense with him, that in a spoone of wood,
(wherewith the Rower eats his potage,) they will give him to drink a little
water.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that neither Captain, Pursser, Patron,
Pylot, Rower, or passenger may hold, keep, or hide any wife of his own, or
others, married or at large, but that of all persons in the Gallie she shall be
seen, known, and also served of more then twain: and if any there do
adventure to pass, they are rather lovers of charity then of chastity: and
sometimes it chances that some wretch has brought her to his great cost. And
she of her own courteous condition yeldeth pleasure unto many.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that freely a Friar of Saint Benet, Saint
Basil, Saint Austine, Saint Frauncis, Saint Dominicke, Saint Hierome,
Carmelite, Trinitarie, and Mercenarie, may go therein: and to the end, that
such religious men, may go there with safe conscience, the Capteines and
Purssers do bear them in hand, that they have obtained a Bull, to be
diuested of their habit, coules, crowns, girdles, and scapularies, and in the
place of Breuiaries or Portasses, they place in their hands oars to learn to
row, and to forgett to pray.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that the ordinary neighbors, and
fraternity thereof, are false witnesses, pirates, thieves, traitors, men whipped
and mangled, adulterers, homicides, and blasphemers: in such manner, that unto
him that demands what is a Gallie? we may answer, It is a certain prison
of the wicked, and a scourge to all passengers.

Of other greater travels and perils, which they pass that go in Galleys.
The vij. Chapter.
IT is a privilege of the Gallie, that all the Purssers, Patrones, Pilots,
Mariners, Counselors, Pages, Helm men, Sweepers, and Rowers, may ask, take,
bribe and also steal from the poor passengers, bread, wine, flesh, bacon,
cheese, fruit, shirtes, shoes, capps, cotes, dublets, girdles, and clokes: and
also if the passenger be somewhat poare blind, and has not his purse tied fast
unto his arm: let him make a reckoning that he forgate it in Civil.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that that which is once lost, forgotten,
lent, or stolen, the right owner may safely yield up his account, that for
evermore he has lost the fight thereof: and if by the force of entreating, and
not without money, the Boteswane do proceed for search thereof, and in terms
to find the same: let the looser be assured, that ye thief with his
unshamefastness will much rather cast it over board, then with safe conscience
make restitution.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that when they go on land for water, or
fetch wood, if by chance they find any lamb, or stumble on a cow, meet
with any sheep, encounter with a goat, or light upon any hog, goose, hen,
pigge, or pullet, without all wambling of stomache, or scruple of conscience,
they take and kill them in the Gallie, as if in the market place they had
bought them.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that when the soldiers, the Rowers, the
Barbarous, and also passengers, go on land near unto some rich or wealthy
place, there are no woods which they hew not, no hiues which they do not
vnemptie, no dove house which they view not, no game which they hunt not, no
garden or orchard which they do not ransacke, no maid or woman whom they do
not violate, boy which they steal not, slave whom they remove not, vineyard
which they gather not, bacon that they vnhange not, either garment which they
bear not away: in such wise, that in an hard year the frost, hail, and
grasshopper, do not execute so great harms, or commit so great cruelties, as
they of the Gallie do perform in one half day.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if any bankrupt, quareller, periuror,
ruffin, robber, thief, or murderer, be once there placed, no Justice may
there enter to make search, or any person which is offended, to accuse: and
if any such, through the wickedness of his own sins, do once enter, either
they set him to the oar, or apply him to some miserable use: in such wise,
that in the Galleys it is, where good men be cast away, and evil defended.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that therein they have liberty to live in
the law wherein they were borne, which is to say, married, unmarried, Nonnes,
Monks, Friars, Priests, Heremites, Greeks, Indians, Heretics, Moors, and
Jews: in such wise, that without any scruple on Fridayes, ye shall behold the
Moors make feasting, and the Jews on the Saturday keep holiday.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that if any poor passenger would carry to
sea, any chest with victuals or apparel, or any trusset with bedding, or
barrellet with wine, or pitcher of water, he must hold it for most certain,
that for the Capteines consent, the Rowers for carriage, ye Purssers for
registring, and the Stewards for keeping, some will have money, and others be
served: and in this case they are not satisfied with that, which you would
give: but that they must bear away, all that, which they demand. For my
self, I may safely swear, that in our last voyage with our great Caesar, in
the ports of Barcellona, Mallorca, Menorca, Sardinia, Lagoleta, Callar,
Pallermo, Micina, Riioles, Naples, Saicta, Ciuita Vicia, Genoua, Nissa, Freuil,
Tholou, and the dead waters: I had more trouble, and spent more money, with
imbarkage and disimbarkage of horses, mules, servants and provision, then
ever I passed, or would have thought in all my life.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that at the time of lading or disimbarkage,
of the poor passenger they take account of his money, they open his chestes,
they take view of his stuff, they rippe his packets, and take custom for all
the same: and if the passenger be poare-blind, or somewhat squinteyed, they will
not only take the right eye, but also the left.

And for that it shall not seem, that we speak at large, I swear by the law
of an honest man, that for the custom of a catt, which I brought from Rome,
at Barcellona, they did take half a Riall.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that upon the waters there is no Gallie so
perfect, sufficient, or so furnished, that in her is not some want, or
defection. which is to say, that either she is weak of timber, old, heavy, a
slug of sail, not armed, open, leaketh much water, or is unfortunate: in such
wise, that notwithstanding she be furnished with the best Patron, or chiefest
Captain, there is always in her, more to be wished, then to be praised.

It is a privilege of ye Gallie, that neither on Christmas or Sabbath day, the
Rowers and passengers cease not to play, steal, blaspheme, travel, or sail:
for that Feasts and Sabbothes in the Galleys be not only unobserved: neither
do they know when they fall.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, to be obliuious of all days and times of
abstinence, for that their godly devotion to fast is never moved, but by some
extreme necessity and want of victuals.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that neither mariners, rowers, adventurers,
or any other officers, have any care, or make any conscience of Religion, or
any part thereof: but only that good part of a Christian which remains in
them, is: that in a dangerous torment, they begin to pray, to sighe, and weep:
which being once past, they sit down at great leisure to eat, talk, play,
fish, and also to curse: recompting unto each other, the dangers that were past,
and the vows which they had made.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all neighbors, inhabitants, and
passengers therein, stand discharged, of all customs, portage, loanes,
tributes, subsidies, pensions, tenthes, and first fruits, either to the king
or Church: as also discharged of all excommunication, for any offense
whatsoever. And when in jest I demanded a testimonial of their confessions,
presently they would show me a pair of cards: affirming that in that holy
fraternity, their chiefest religion was to play, curse, and swear.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that none which shall there happen to die,
shall be bound to be innoyled, or pay for ringing of bells, either to the priest
for his burial, either building of his sepulcher, either to the friars for
their diriges, either to the poor for carrying of torches, either sowing of
his winding sheet: because the miserable, which there once dies, shall
scarcely yield his spirit to God, when they shall hurl the body unto the
fishes.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that there all manner persons do eat flesh
in Lent, in Vigils, and all other days forbidden: and question being
demanded of their want of shame or of conscience, they answer, That since
all manner persons on land, do adventure to eat fish which proceeds from
the Sea, upon any day: by the same reason it is convenient for them, to eat
flesh at any time, that comes from the land.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that all bread, wine, bacon, powdered flesh,
cheese, butter, raisons, biscuit, dishes, and pots, which shall remain unto any
passenger of his provision, to leave all unto the Gallie at his departing unto
land: in such wise, that they never cease to take the surplusage: and in time
of necessity, to relieve always, not so much as with a raison.

It is a privilege of the Gallie, that every passenger that presumes of
Gentry, courtesy, or shamefastnes, to gratify the Captain, to embrace the
steward, to speak unto the Pilot, to take his leave of the whole company, to
reward the sweepers, to give somewhat to the helm man, and also to have
remembrance of the pages of the squiffe: all which if he do not perform,
they will yield him a cruel departure, and will not afterward accept him into
that Gallie.

But the conclusion is, that notwithstanding their privileges are many,
notable, and extreme, we always affirm, and confirm with the words of our
Theme, which is to say:

To live in the Gallie at the Seas,
God dispose it to whom it shall please.
Of a certain subtle discretion of the sea, and of her perilous properties.
The viii. Chapter.
SOmewhat being said of the privileges and conditions of the Gallie, now let
us say somewhat of the nature of the sea: for that it is no small error to
commend our life unto him, whose virtuous conditions, or cruel inclination is
to us unknown.

To the end we may understand the deeds of the sea, consider the name
wherewith she is endued: since this her name, Mare, imports none other thing
but bitterness: because her water is very bitter, but her condition most bitter.

The sea is not so well conditioned, that any man should adventure to enter the
same, of will, but of necessity: because that man which saileth, except it be
to the discharge of his conscience, or defense of his honor, or to support his
living: I say and affirm, that such a one is either unadvised, or detesteth
his life, or else they hold him as a fool, or as one distraught of his wits.

The sea is delectable to behold, and perilous to pass.

The sea deceives no man, but once: for whom she once deceives, shall never
more complain of her.

The sea is a Mine, where many be enriched: and a Cemetorie where infinite
people are buried.

The sea, if she like, does suffer to be sailed with a planke: and if she be
enraged, she consents not a Carrecke to endure her.

The sea resembles a fool, for that she alters every quarter of the Moon:
and makes no difference betwixt a king and a plough man.

The sea suffers neither fools nor sluggardes: because it chiefly agrees
with all such as wander therein, to be of great life in their business, and most
diligent in their Navigations.

The sea is a cloak for sinners, and a refuge for malefactors: for in her,
there is none waged for their virtue, or rejected for their wickedness.

The sea dissembleth with the vicious, but likes not to be inhabited with
cowards: for he enters her limits to small and very evil purpose, that is a
coward to fight, and timorous in sailing.

The sea is very malicious, and always to be considered by her contraries: for
that in calm, she prepares a tempest: and in time of tempest, she prepares a
calm.

The sea is affectionate to some, and appassionate with others: for if she
like, to one she susteyneth life xx. years, and another she depriueth the
first day.

The sea is a great enemy to al things that sustain humane life: because her
fish is flegmatike, her air importune, her water salt, her humor hurtful,
and her sailing perilous.

The sea of as many as saileth in her, holds none contented: for she yields
their bodies tired with the grossenes of their life: and their hearts always
in great carefulnes of some perilous tempest.

The sea of her own condition makes all stomaches hungry, but we may well
pardon her the appetite which she gives to eat, through the force which she
uses to make us cast our gorge.

The sea entiseth or deceives any man, to the end to enter or to commit trust
unto her: for unto all men she discovers the monstruousnes of her fish, the
profunditie of her depths, the swelling of her seas, the contrariety of her
winds, the cruelty of her rocks, and fiercenes of her torments: in such
wise, that such as be there lost, be not cast away for want of aduisement: but
for certain great dizards.

The sea suffers her self of all men to be seen, to be fished, and to be
sailed, but jointly therewith, she remoueth all jurisdiction from all men, and
from all sufficient power to change her condition. We say no more in this
case, but that:

To live in the Gallie at the Seas,
God dispose it to whom it shall please.
Of the things which the passenger has to provide, when he enters the
Gallie. The ix. Chapter.
SOmewhat being said of the privileges of the Gallie, and of the conditions of
the sea: there remains not, but to speak of the necessary provision for
Navigations: for it suffices not that the passenger be advertised of all
things, from which he has to save himself: but that also he enter provided
of all things necessary.

It is a convenient counsel for every man that goes to sea, either in ship or
Gallie, not as an Infidel, but as a Christian to commend himself unto God: for
that the sailer leads his life in as great hazard, as if he should enter
into a set battle.

Also it is a convenient counsel, that all manner persons, before they enter
the Sea, do make their will, declare their debtes, accomplish with their
creditours, repart their goods, and reconcile them selves with their enemies,
because they may afterward happen to find them selves in so terrible a
storm, that for all the treasure of this world, they would not be burdened
with any scruple of conscience.

It is a convenient counsel, for the curious passenger, either sailer, ten
or fifteen days before he go aboorde, to cleanse and euacuate his body,
either with Rossid, Honnie, Rosa Alexandrina, good Canafistula, or else with
some perfect Pill: for that naturally the Sea uses more pity with empty
stomaches, then with such as are repleate and oppressed with ill humors.

It is a convenient counsel, and no unsound advise, to sail in a Gallie of
new timber, and that the Thoughts thereof be worn smoothe: for at the
doubling of a point, passing any race or gulffe, or inuesting with another
Gallie, or at the chase of an army, or in some furious storm, the new Gallie
is more light and nimble to be governed both with sail and oars, and best
does save her self at Sea, and the smoothness of the Thoughts helps much
in rowing.

Also it is sound counsel, that before the passenger do imbarke, he go to
visit and talk with the Captain, and to use him with fair terms, and no
less courtesy: which is to weete, if he be aboorde, to send him some
refreshing: and if on land, to banquet him, or to accompany him: for as the
Capteines of Galleys desire wind, go with the wind, live with the wind,
sail with the wind, always there cleaves unto them some tache of the wind:
wherewith they will of their friends be honored, of their enemies feared, and
of their passengers served.

It is sound counsel, that at the instant he shall enter the Gallie, he
frame friendship with the Steward and Boteswane, to have license to walk on
hatches, with some rower to attend him, and to make him neat: with the
Pylote, to accept him: with the Justice, for his favor: with the Cook, for
his fire: with the sweepers, for attendaunce in the poope: with the pages, to
row him to land: for if he hold them not all well pleased, he is entered into
the Gallie very evil appointed.

It is also convenient counsel, before he be embarked, that he make him some
garment, that is strong and well furred, more profitable then comely: wherewith
he may without loss, upon hatches, lie down in the Crossebowe room, climb
into the poope, go on land, defend him self from heat, succor him self
from rain, and also at night to use it for his bed: for that, garments in
the Gallie, ought rather to serve for profit, then honor.

It is convenient counsel, that the curious and delicate passenger, do make
his provision of some half bed, of a doubled sheet, of a little mantell, and
no more but one pillowe: for, any man to carry an whole and a great bed into
the Gallie, is to give occasion unto some to deride, and unto others to laugh:
for on the day time, there is no place to lay it, and at night much less to
spread and make it.

It is sound counsel, that for his provision he have white biskett, old
Bacon, good cheese, powdered beef, and also some fatt hens: for these, and
such other things, he may not be excused to buy, that goes to Sea.

It is sound counsel, that the worshipful passenger make his provision of
some Barrel, Butt, or Skin of good white wine of a year old, clear, and
fragrant: whereof, after he has discharged his gorge, he shall more esteem
one drop, then at another time an whole Barrel: and further, the savor
thereof shall reform his stomache, and the smell comfort his head.

It is convenient counsel, for him that would eat cleanly, to be provided of
some towell, napkin, pott, pitcher, and cup: because these trifles are
sildome sold in Galleys, and much less borrowed.

It is sound counsel, especially for that person, which is poareblinde, that
if he carry any chest with provision, any Male with armor, any Barrel with
wine, any pack with garments, or any Caskett with writings, presently that
he cause the Captain to see it, the Pursser to register it, and the Steward to
save it: for that in the Gallie, for scruple of conscience they leave not from
a needle vpwardes.

It is sound counsel, that he do very well consider with whom he is
conversant, with whom he enters, in whom he trusts, with whom he
speaks, and also with whom he plays: for, in the Gallie they are so
handsome, and advised, that if they find the passenger but a little wittlesse,
there shall not want three, which by playing booty, shall provide him a
release of all his money.

It is a convenient counsel, that at the instant in which he is embarked, he
importune the Captain, request the Steward, entreat the Justice, and recover
friendship with some rower: to the end, that if he may not obtain place in
the poope, or be admitted to some cabinet, at the least to assign him to some
crossebowe room: for, if he be dull or negligent in these cases, let him hold
it for certain, and also condemned, that in the day he shall not find where
to sit, much less at night where to lodge.

It is convenient counsel, for the passenger, that presumes either of
wisdom, or honesty, to procure books, both good and pleasant, and some of
prayers as matter of devotion: for of three exercises which are used at Sea,
which is to weete, play, talk, and read, the most profitable and least
hurtful is reading.

It is convenient counsel, that the passenger before he be embarked, do
provide hooks, lines, bayte, and canes: that when they are becalmed, or lying
in any road, or placed behind some rock, or the forecastell being thrust
alande: to draw forth his trinkets, and settle him self to take fish: since
in fishing he shall take recreation, and great savor in the eating: for his
mind peace and quietness, and for his pursse much more profit it is, to be
fishing in the forecastell, then at dice in the poope.

Also it is sound counsel, that the nice passenger make his provision, of
raisons, figs, almondes, diacitron, dates, comfites, and other delicate
conserues: for, when the Sea rolleth aloft, and the torment increases, belches
be practicing, to cast the gorge, and discharge the stomache, the eyes grow
dim, and the appetite is lost: if in that conflict the poor passenger be
unprovided of some comfortable conserve, I command him some hard adventure.

Also it is convenient counsel, not to be unprovided of a bunche of garlike,
of a rope of onyons, a bottle of vinegar, a barrelet of oil, and also of a
box of salt: for, notwithstanding they be rusticall meats, and not delicate
for sailors, or licorishe to be stolen. And further and besides all this, it
may happen that of soppes, water, salt, and oil, there may be made a slampamp
or an hotchepotch, that at some other time, shall exceed a Capon in taste.

Also it is convenient counsel, that every discreet passenger provide him
self of corked pantophels, double soled shoes, of Mariners sloppes, of close
hunting cappes, and of four or five clean shirts: because Sea water is of
such a quality, and the Gallie of such indisposition, that first thou shalt
foul them all, before thou shall wash one.

Also it is sound counsel, chiefly for nice and delicate stomaches, to
provide them selves of perfumes, as of Beniamine, Storax, Amber, Aloes, or of
Pomander of some special good confection: for it many times happens, that
the Pumpe yeldeth so cruel a stenche, that only it dismaith not, but also
constrains to discharge the stomache.

It is also a profitable and necessary counsel, that every passenger do
carefully consider, to have his stomach always in temper, and not ouercharged
with meats or drinks: that is to say, to eat little, and drink less: for
if on land it be dishonest, at Sea much more, and dangerous in tempest, to
eat until he belche, and drink until he cast.

And because it shall not seem, that we speak at large, passing the gulffe
of Narbona in a great tempest, there was in my Gallie, a gluttonous dronkard,
which at two belches cast up his meat, and with the third he did yield up his
soul.

Also it is sound counsel, and of experience, that to defend the stomache
from the sickness of the Sea: a paper of Saffron be placed upon the breast,
near unto the heart, and in the fury of the tempest to keep him self both
warm and quiet: whereupon he may be assured, that his stomach shall neither
wamble, nor his head grow giddie.

In all the navigations which we had with my Lord and master Caesar, when he
attempted the conquest of the great Tunes in Africa, these rules I used,
which did yield me my life: I say, the life of the body: because the life
of the soul, is given us in that glory, Ad quam nos perducat Jesus Christus
filius Dei, qui cum patre and spiritu sancto viuit and regnat in secula
seculorum. Amen.
