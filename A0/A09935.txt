Note the golden nombre that is written after the saints on the right hand in

Unto the reader grace and peace in Christ.
Among other innumerabill pestilent infections of books and lernynges / with
which the Christian have been pytuously seduced and deceived (brought up in
diverse ki^des of diffidence and false hope) I may judge / and that chyefly /
those to be pernycious / of whom they are wont in every place to pray / and
have also learned by heart / both curyously and with great scrupulosite to make
rehersall of their sins. These books (though they abounded in every place
with infinite erroures / and taught prayers / made with wicked folysshenesse /
both to god / and also to his saints / yet by cause they were garnyshed with
glorious titles and with read lettres promisinge much grace and pardon
(though it were but vanyte) have sore deceived the unlearned multitude one is
called the garden of the soul an other the paradise of the soul / and by
cause I will be short look thou thy sylfen whate diverse and tryfeling names be
given unto their Wherefore here needs sharp reformacion ye and many of them
are worthy to be utterly distroyed.

The same judgment and reformation is also to be had of the books of passions
and saints lives called legendes for in these also are many things added
whereof Satan is author howbeyt sith nether time sufficient is given to one man
nether the but thom of this reformacyon of one may be sustained I thought it
enough / in this place a lonely to have monysshed you trusting that god in time
coming shall add to these things both time convenient and also light.

Therefore here (as entering my moter) first I will declare after a syngle and
plain manner (by, the which eue^ as by a glass) thou shall know whate the
knowelege of sin is and how we ought truly to pray following the rehersall
of the commandments and of the Pater noster. And I doubt not but this one
prayer is sufficient enough to them that prayer how of them so ever it be or
whate so ever they require ye if they take but one little part of it which so
ever it be / for a good prayer is not set i^ the multitude of words as Cirst
says in the syxte of Mathewe. But here stondith the pith that thou syghe to
god often from the boto^ of thine heart for to have streynght to do his will and
to fulfill his commandments. And this syghe ought to endure contynually.

Therefore I desire all persons that from hensforth they forget such prayers
as ar saint Brygittes and other like / which great promyses and perdons have
falsely auaunced from whom you shall return unto this simple prayer needful
for every christen / whose common use does yet persevere among all men / if they
did understand it / and applied their minds to it. Such virtue has the Pater
noster / that the lenge^ and the more thou use it / the swetter and more
acceptable it is. Which I desire that the master of this prayer confyrme Jesus
Christ which is blyssed eternally. Amen.

The symbol or Creed of the great doctor Athanasius daily red in the Church
WHo soever will be saved / before all things it is necessary that he hold
the true Catholyke faith Which faith / but if every man will keep hole and
inuiolate / without dout he shall eternally perysshe.

This truly is the very Catholyke faith that we worsshyp one God in trinite /
and the trinite in unite.

Neither confoundyng the persons / neither seperatinge the substance.

The person of the Father is one / the person of the sone an other / the
person of the holy Ghost an other.

But of the Father / of the sone / and of the holy ghost / there is one
divinity / equal glory / coeternall majesty.

Such as is the Father / such is the Son / such is the holy Ghost.

The Father is uncreate / the Sone vncreat / the holy Ghost is vncreat.

The father is without measure / the Son without measure / the holy Ghost
without measure.

The Father is everlasting / the sone everlasting / the holy Ghost everlasting.

And not with standing there be not.iij. everlasting / but one everlasting.

Even as there be not three vncreat: nor ii^. vnmesurate / but one vncreat / and
one vnmesurate.

Likewise the father is almighty / the son almighty / and the holy Ghost
almighty.

And yet they be not three Almyghtes / but one God almighty.

So the Father is God / the Son God / the holy Ghost is God.

And yet they be not.iij. gods / but one God.

So the Father is a lord / the Sone a lord / the holy Ghost a lord.

And yet they be not.iij. Lords / but one Lord.

For as we be compelled by the Chrysty / and veryte to confess seperatly every
one person to be God and lord.

So are we prohybite by the Catholyke relygyon of Christ's faith to say that
there be.iij. gods or three lords.

The father is made of none / neither created nor gotten.

The Sone is from the Father alone: neither made ne create / but gotten.

The holy ghost is from the father / and the Sone / neither made created nor
gotten but procedynge.

And so there is but one Father / not three Fathers / one Son / not three
Sons / one holy ghost / not three holy ghostes.

And in this trinyte / there is none before or after another / nothing more or
less but all the three persons be coeterne / and coequall to them self.

So that by always as now it has been above said / the trinyte in unity / and
the unity in trinite may we worshypper.

He therefore that will be saved / let him understand thus of the trinite.

But it is necessary unto everlasting health / that every christian believe
also faithfully the incarnacyon of our Lord Jesus Christ.

It is therefore the right faith: that we be leue^ confess that our lord Jesus
Christ the Sone of God / is God and man.

He is God by the substance of the Father gotten before all worlds / and he is
man by the substance of his mother / borne in the world.

Perfyte God / perfyte man / being of a soul reasonable / and of flesh
humayne,

Equal to the Father by his godhed less then the Father by his manhed.

Which though he be God and man / yet is there not twain but one Christ.

Truly he is one not by turnyng of his godhed in to manhed / but by
assumptynge of his manhed in to godhed.

Being out to all intentes / not by confusyon of substance / but by unite of
person.

For as the reasonable soul and the flesshely body is or makes one man / so
God and man is one Christ.

Which suffered death for our salvation descended to hell / and rose from
death the third day.

Which ascended to heuens / sytteth at the right hand of God the Father
almighty from thense shall he come to judge the quycke and dead.

At whose coming all men must rise with their bodies: and shall give account
of their own propre deeds.

And they that have done well shall go in to everlasting life / they that have
done evil in to everlasting fire.

This is the Catholyke says / which except every man faithfully / and
steadfastly do believe he can not be saved.

Finis.
The office of all Estates. i. Timothe.iij.
A Bishop must be fautlesse / the husband of one wife: sober discrete:
honestly appareled: herberous / apt to teach / not dronke^ not fyghter: not
given to fylthy lucrebut gentyl / abhorringe fighting / abhorringe
covetousness / and one that rules his own house honestly / having children
under obedyence / with all honest.

Rulers. Sapien. i.
Ye that are rulers of the earth / se that you love ryghteousnes / and that you
commyt none unrighteous in judgment. Leui. ix. Thou shalt not favor the
poor / nor honor the mighty / but shall judge thy neighbor ryghtteously.

The co^mens. Leui. xix.
Ye shall not deceive your brethren: neither with weight nor measure / but
shall have true balances / and true weyghtes / for I am the Lord your God.

Husbands. Ephe. v
Husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the congregacyon / and gave him
self for it to sanctyfy it and cleansed it in the fou^tayne of water through
the word / to make it unto him self / a glorious congregacyon with out spot
or wrencle / or any such thing. So ought men to love their wives / as their
own bodies. He that loves his wife / loves him self. For no man ever yet
hated his own flesh / but norrysshed it, etc.

Wives. Ephe. v.
Wives submit your selves to your own husbands / as to the lord. For the
husband is te wives heed / even as Christ is the heed of the congregacyon.
Therefore as the co^gregacyo^ is in subjection to Christ likewise let the
wives be in subiectyon to their husbands in all things.

Fathers and Mothers. Ephe. v.
Ye fathers move not your children unto wrath but bring them up with the
nurture and informacyon of the lord.

Children. Ephe. vi.
Children obey your fathers and mothers in the Lord: for so it is right,
Honor the Father and mother (that is the first commandment that has any
promise) that thou may be in good estate and live long on the earth.

Masters. Colles.iij.
Ye masters / do to your servants that which is just and equal puttyng
away all bytternisse and threatenynges knowinge that even ye also have a
master in heaven

Servants. Collos.iij.
Servants / be obedyent to your bodyly masters in all things: not with eye
service as men pleasers / but in synglenesse of heart / fearing God. And what
soever ye do / do it hertely as though ye did it unto the lord / and not unto
men: for as much as ye know that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of
enherytaunce for ye serve the Lord Christ.

Wydowes. 1. Timo. v.
She that is a very wydowe and friendless puts heth trust in god / and
contynueth in supplicasyon and prayer night and day.

The sum of all.
Love thy neighbor as thy self. And whatsoever ye would that other should do
to you do you even the same to them and what ye would not that other men should
do to you / se that ye do it not to them.

A prayer for wysdom. Sapien.ix. chapter Deus patrum nostrorum / et dominus
misericordie.
O The God of our fathers / god of mercy / which have made al with thy word /
and with thy wisdom haste constytuded man / to have dominyon upon the creature
which was made of the / to order the world with equity and justice / and with
a dyrecte heart for to judge judgments / give me the assystent wisdom of thy
seats and reprove me not from thy children. For thy servant am I / and the
sone of thy hand maid / a man weyke and of little time and vnsuffycyent to the
understanding of thy judgment and laws. And if any shall be of most perfyte
wisdom among the sons of men / if thy wisdom ones fly from him he shall be
counted and regarded at naught. Send thy wisdom from thy holy heuyns / and
from the seat of thy myghtynes that it may be with me / and labor with me /
and that I may know what is acceptable before the. For she knows all / and
understands all and shall conduyt me sobrely in my works / and shall ^epe me
in her power. And my words shall be acceptable. So be it.

The prayer of Solomon for wysdom ij. Reg. iij. Chapter. Tu fecisti domine cum
seruo tuo.
THou have done (lord) with thy servant David my father great mercy so that
he walked in thy sight in truth and justice and right heart with the. Thou
sauedest unto him thy great mercy / and gave him a sone syttinge upon his
trone / as it is at this day. And now lord god: thou have made thy servant
to reygne in the room of David my father. I am a very babe and know not mine
entering / nor my coming out / and thy servant is in the myddest of an
infinite people / which thou have chosen / which can not be nombred nor
counted for the m^ l^ytude. Wherefore thou shalt give to thy servant an heart
apt to be taught / to the intent he may judge thy people / and discern
bytwyxte good and evil. For who can judge this people: this thy people so many.

For co^petency of living the prayer of Solomon. Prouer. the.xxx. chapter Duo
rogaui te / ne deneges mihi.
TWo things (lord) have I required the that thou would not deny me until I
dye. Vanite and words of lesynge make far from me. Poverty or riches give me
not. Only give that is necessary for my lyuinge / lest per chaunche being in
full habundaunce I might be provoked to deny the / and say who is the lord.
Or compelled by necessyte I might steal and for swear the name of my God. So
be it.

A prayer of the church of the faithful / for the word of God to be spoken
with boldenes of heart. Acts the.xiiij Chapter. Dn^e tu fecisti celum and
terram mare. etc.
Lord thou have made heuyn and earth / see / and all that be in them / which
with thy holy spirit by the mouth of our father David thy servant saydest. Why
do the gentylles fume like wild bores / and why do the people attempt things
in vain. The kings of the earth be assembled and the princes be gathered
together against the lord and against his Christ / for with out sail there
assembled in this cite against thy holy child Jesus (whom thou dydest anoint)
Herod and Ponce Pylate with the gentylles and people of Israhel to do the
things with thy power and thy counseyl did determyne before to be done.

And now lord cast thine iye upon their manasses / and give to thy
servants with all boldenes / power to speak thy word extendyng thy hand io
healynges / and signs / and wonders to be wrought in the name of thy holy sone
Jesus.

FAther the hour is come / glorifye thy sone / that thy sone may glorifye
the, As thou gave him power of every flesh to the entente that all that
thou gave hi^ he might give the everlasting life. And this is everlasting
life that they know only the for the true god and whom thou sendest Jesus
Christ. I have glorified the in earth. I have performed the work which
thou gave me to do. And new glorifye thou me Father with thy self / with the
glory which I had before this world was made of the I have publysshed thy
name of the men / whom thou gave me of the world. They were thine / and
thou gave them to me / and they kept my word. Now they know that all that
thou gave me come from the. For the words which thou gave me I have them /
and they took them / and knew verily that they came from the / and they believed
that thou sentest me. For them I ask / for the world I ask not / but for
them which thou gave me because they be thine and all mine be thine / and
thine mine / and I am glorified in them. And I am now no longer in to world:
But they be in the world still. For I come to the / holy Father save them for
thy names sake whom thou haste given me / that they may be one as we be one.
When I was with the^ in the world I did keep the^ in thy name, Whom thou
gave me I kept and none of them peryshed / but only the sone of perdicyon
that the scripture might be fulfilled. But now I come to the / and these I
speak in the world that they may have my joy replenyshed in them. I gave them
thy word / and the world hated them because they be not of the world: like as
I am not of the world. I asked not that thou should take the^ away out of
the world: but that thou keep them from the wicked. They be not of the world
/ like as I am not of the world. Make the^ holy in thy truth. Like as thou
have sent me in to the world / so have I seem the^ in to the world / and for
the^ I do sanctifye my self / that they also may be sanctified in the truth.
And I pray not only for them / but also for them that shall believe in me
through their preachynges: so that all they may be one. Like as thou (father)
art in me and I in the / that they also may be in us / that the world may
believe that thou have sent me. And the glory / which thou have given me / I
gave it the^ that they might be one: like as we be one / I in them / and thou
in me / that they may be made perfyte in one / and that the world may know
that thou have sent me / and loved them as thou loved me. Father / they whom
thou haste given me / I will that where I be / they may also be with me that
they may se my glory / which thou gave me / for thou have loved me before
the making of the world. Just father / the world knows the not: but I
know the and these know that thou have sent me / and I have made known unto
them thy name / and I will make it known to the intent / that the love
wherewith thou love me might be in the^ and I in them.

The Preface.
IT was never ordained without the singular providence of God / that the
multitude of Christian should learn be heart the ten commandments / the
Credo / and the Paternoster. For truly he that understands these / has the
pythe af all those things / which holy scripture does conteyne or what so
ever may be taught necessary unto the Christen / and that purely and copyously
/ bysides that so briefly and clearly / that no man can complain or excuse him
sylfe justly / sith that (which is required to the blyssed life) is nether
over tedious / nor yet so hard but it may be performed. Three things there
are necessary to be known to obtain eternal life.

The first is that thou know whate is expedient to be done / and whate to be
undone. The second / when thou perceauest that thou of thy nowne strenght
can nether do / nether yet avoid that / which thou art bound to do / or to
eschew / that then thou know of whom to seek / find and receive this
streyngth. The third is / how thou should seek / and obtain it. And
herunto I will give the an ensample to the intent that thou may the more
euydently perceive it. A man which is diseased with any manner of sykenesse /
first enquireth with what kind of syckenesse he is infect / and then
co^sydereth he what streyngth he has what he is able to do and what he can not
do them sercheth he for a me dicyne to ley to his decease so that by this
means he may get his health / and that he may afterward be able to do and leave
undone all things as the hole. Finally when he has found this medecin he
wilt take it and use it. Likewise the commandments of God do teach a man to
know his infirmyte that he may understand and seal what he can do and what
he can not / what he can leave and wath he ca^ not so that he may knowledge
hi^sylf a vicious person and a sinner. After he has knoweleged him sylf / so
that the^ he may learn by faith where to find remedy and grace whereby he may
be restored and justified and so may be abyll to fulfill the commandments.
For faith plainly declares god and his mercy showed and given in Christ. But
the pater noster does teach how we should desire faith / and obtain this
bounteous favor as in a well ordered meke and faithful prayer which gets
al these things so that fulfylling the commandments of god we may be saved
and made blessed. Wherefore (as I have said) in these three consysteth the hole
scripture.

Wherefore it is expedyent to begin at the commandments so that we may by
the^ learn to knowelege our sin and malice (as the spiritual infirmite)
which makes us feable and weak so that we can nether do nether leave that
which we are bound to do or to leave.

The ten commandments.
THe first and most excellent table of Moses conteyneth three commandments /
and does show unto us whate we owe to God / that is to sey / whate we ought to
do or to eschew / concerning those things which specially pertyne unto God.
Therefore in the first of all the commandments / we are taught what god
requires in every man's heart / and what man ought to judge and think of him
/ that is that he look ever for the best of hi^ / even as of a father or of a
special friend / and that with out doutyng or any mistrust / with constant
faith / trust / and love ever fearyng to displease him / even as kind
children fear to displease their natural fathers. For very nature does
teach that there is one God / of whom all our goodness spryngeth which is
our socoure in all aduersite for this did the hethen grant unto their ydolles.

The words of this commandment are these. Thou shall have no strange gods.
THe second precepte teaches us how we ought to order our self toward
god / as concerning our outward works before men / or else inwardly in our
own conscience / which is that we honor the name of god / for no man can
she we God as he is in his own nature / nether to him self / nether yet to
any other but by his only name.

The words of this commandment are these. Thou shall not take the name of
god in vain.
THe third precept does show how we ought to behave our self toward god in
outward works / and in wurschippyng him. The words are these.

Thou shall keep holy the saboth day.
HEre may thou se how in these three precepts a man is taught to order hi^
silf toward God in his understanding / thoughts of the heart words and
works that is to say thorough out all his life.

The second Table.
The second and last Table of Moses co^teyneth.vij. precepts following and
this shows us how we ought to behave our silues unto our neighbor both in
doing and leuyng undone.

THe first of these does teach us what we are bound to do to the high of
officers and such as are in auctorite / the which seeing that they are set
to rule here instead of god it is according that this precept be set next in
place after those three which do perteyne to god him silft. The examples of
this commandment are father / mother / lord / lady / master / and
mastresse. The words are these.

Thou shall honor thy father and mother.
IN the second precept of this table we learn how we ought to live with our
equalles and neighbors and this does chiefly concern the person of man that
we should hurt no man but rather with our labor and diligence to succor
and promote the^. Which is contained in these words.

Thou shall not kill.
THe third passith thy neighbors person and shewith whate thou should do
concerning his chieffe possessions as wife children and kinsmen that thou
nether defile nor de fame them but that thou do thy dyligence as much as
lies in the to save their honor and dygnite the words are

Thou shall not commytte aduoutrye.
THe fourth treatyth of thy neighbors other mouabyll goods teaching that
thou take no thing from him / nor diminyshe nor hurt any thing that he has /
but rather to profyt / and encreace it. The words are.

Thou shall not steal.
IN the fifte we are taught how to order our sylfe concerning the name and
good fame of our neighbor / never to sclaunder him but to help and defend
him as much as lies in us. These are the words of it.

Thou shall bear no false witness against thy neyboure.
Therefore it is forboden us to hurt any kind of our neighbors goods / but
contrary wife commanded that we should encreace them. Now if we look on the
law of nature / we shall sone perceive how merueylous / equal / good and
ryghtuous these precepts are. For there is nothing commanded in all these
that perteyne either to god or to our neygh boure / but that every man would
that it should be performed touward him self if he were in the stead of god
or of his neighbor,

THe.ij. last precepts do reprove and co^dempne us for the wickedness and
malice of our nature / and teach us how pure we ought to be / from all
desyringes of the flesh / and goods carnal. Here is the strife / the war
/ and labor / wherein we ought to be exercised all our life / which.ij.
commandments are given in these words.

Thou shall not desire thy neighbors house.
THou shall not desire thy neighbors wife / servants / maidens / catel and
whate so ever he possessith.

A short conclusyon of the ten commandments.
Christ him self says on this manner whate so ever ye would that men should
do to you / the same do you to them. In this is comprehended the law and all
the Prophets. Mat.vij.

THere is no man that for his great benefits loves to receive unkindness.
There is no man will gladly suffer his name to be evil spoken of by an other
There is no man which will be content to be dispysed of a proud man. Besides
that there is no man that loves the disobedyence / wrath or unchasteness of
his wife. There is no man which would be dispoyled of his possessions
defrayded / deceived / sclaundered oppressed. But rather all men are of this
nature / that they had lever be favored loved kindly entreated helped and
trusted of their neighbors which all are commanded in these ten
precepts.

Of the transgressyon of the commandments.

THey that ascrybe their trouble and aduersite / to the devil / or other evil

do.

Against the last two.
THe last two precepts are these verey mark set before us unto the which
we must strive to come by daily labou^e and penance trusting in the help of
god / (...) in his favor / for our evil desires will ^euer be utterly
destroyed until our flesh be brought and be renewed with another ^eneracyon.
The.v. wits are co^prehen^ed in the fyft and syxt commandment. The ^i.
works of mercy in.v. and.vij. The.vij ^edly sins. Pride in the first and
secun^e / lechery in the syxt / wrath and envy in the ^yft / glotony in the
syxt / slewth in the third (...) and in all the other.

Likewise the sins which are touwar^es other / show them selves thorough
^ll the commandments / for a man may offend against all the precepts / by
commaundyng / councelinge or helpyng other.

The sins which are called dumm^ and cry for vengeance to god are contrary
to the sixth and seventh commandments. In all these works we se none other
thi^^ but the love of our silfe / which seeks hi^ own and takes from God /
that which i^ gods / and from men those things that p^teyne to men / it
gives no thing that it has to god nor to man. Wherefore it may well (...) true
that (s. Augustyn says) the hedde o^ all sin is the love of our silfe. Of
thi^ folowith that the precepts command ^^ne other thing but love. Ageyn
forbid n^thing but love. And that he that keeps the commandments fulfilleth
/ nothing b^ love. Ageyn nothing but love breketh t^ commandments. And that
is it that P^le says love is the fulfilling of all the commandments. Even as
wikked love (the is to sey the love of thy sylfe) is the brekin^ of all the
commandments.

The fulfillinge of the co^maundeme^t^
THe fulfilling of the first co^maund^ment is fear and love toward G^ with
an vntayned faith to trust co^stau^ly unto god in all things to betake our
sylfe plainly and purely unto god in all points to mistrust and deny our
sylf utterly in all things whether they be good or badde. Here put in whate so
ever is written in ^he hole scripture of faith hope and love ^owardes god which
are shortly contained in this first precept.

The fulfilling of the second is.
TO praise to honor to bliss and call on the name of god. Utterly to
dispi^e and forsake our own name and glory so that god only have the praise
which ^lone works all things. Here takes ^lace whate thing so ever is
written in ho^y scripture of the praise of God / of giving ^hankes to him / of
the name of god / of joy and gladness.

The fulfylling of the third is.
TO betake our sylfe holy to god that he alone may work in us and do al
^hinges. This commandment requires ^ouertye of spryte / which should offer
him self to god / as deed and not living in this ^orlde that he may be his
god / which on ^ym sylfe may take both his name and work ^ccordynge to the
meaning of the two for said commandments. Herunto perteyneth what so ever is
commanded unto us of worsshypping god / of heryng gods word of good works
/ be which we may subdue the flesh to the sprete / so that all our life /
and all our works be gods and not our own.

THe fulfillynge of the fourth is wylfull obedience and meekness to submytte
him self to all officers / because it pleases god so (as wrytteth thapostel
Peter) without contradictyon / without compleynt and without any grudging.
Herunto apply what so ever things are wryte^ in scripture of obedyence /
humylite / subiectyon / and reverence.

The fulfylling of the fyft is.
SVffraunce / meekness / goodness / peace / mercy / an heart that is full
purifyed with love and sweetness / clean without hate / wrath and bitterness
/ not to his friends only / but also to his enemies / ye and indifferently to
all men. Hither confer all the instructyons of pacyence / gentilnesse / peace
and unite.

The fulfylling of the syxt is.
CHaslite sobernes shame fastness not of deeds only but of words and manners
/ ye and of thoughts. Besides that attemperaunce / of meat / drink / sleep /
and what so ever does help chastity / hither apply al places of holy
scripture concerning, chastity / fasting / sobriety / attemperaunce / prayer
watching / labors / and in co^clusyon all things that mainteyn chastity.

The fulfylling of the seventh is.
POuerte of spryte / kyndenesse / liberalyte / wasting of our own goods to
profit our neighbors / to live without covetousness and desire of richesse.
Here gather all that is written of covetousness of goods unjustly gotten and
possessed / of usury / so tylte / evil deceyte / of injury and hurt done / of
lettyng thy neighbors profyt / or dispysing him.

The fulfylling of the eight is.
A Peasable and hole tongue which hurts no man / but profyteth all men
which sets enemies at one / which excuses and defends them that are
noted viciose parsons and sinners. Such simplicite and profit is in speaking.
Hereto perteyne all things which are spoken of silence and speaking / and
whate so ever touches the good name / honor / right causes / and profyttes /
of thy neighbor.

The fulfilling of the last is.
THe perfyt and absolute pureness and dispysing (in the heart) of all temporal
richesse and pleasures / which thing shall be done perfectly in the life to
come.

In all these things see thou none other things but to love other / that is
to love god and thy neighbor which love seeks not his own profyt / but
only those things which belong to god / and to his neighbor / which love
yeldeth and gives him sylf plainly to every man grauntyng them full rule and
auctorite / to use their pleasure his goods and profyttes.

Now seyst thou that in all these ten commandments / in a good order and
briefly are contained / all kinds of in formacions / that are expedient for
man's life / which if any man will do his diligence to keep truly he shall
never be ydel no / not an hour / but shall have occasyon to do good deades /
so that truly he shall never have need to chose to him other strange works
of mannys invention / as are to run hither and thither / and to be occupied in
such things / which in no place are commanded / and which shall be
profitable for no thing.

Hit is euydent that in all these precepts there is nothing written / which
teaches us to serve our silues / either to do / leave / or require of any man
/ that which co^cernyth our own proufit / but only what we are bound to do
to other / that is to sey / to god and to our neyboure. So that even blind
men may well perceive that the fulfylling of the commandments stondeth in
love toward other / not toward our sylfe. For man of his own nature
seeks and auoydeth sufficiently / that which is for (or against) his profit /
so that it nedith not to move him to it / but much rather to bring him from
hit. There fore he lives best which lives not to him sylfe.

And contrary he lives worst which lives to him sylf. This is theffect that
the ten commandments teach. Whereby it is manifest that there are but few
that live well it / in that we are men / none of us lyeuth well.

This known / we must learn of whom to axe this excellent gift / to live
well / so that we may fulfill these commandments

The Creed or Belefe.
THe effect of our faith stondith in three parts / as in hit are rehearsed three
parsonnes of the godly trynyte. The first is of the father. The secunde of the
son. The third of the holy ghost / and to every one of these persons is
applied his operation. This is the chief article of the faith / on the which
all the other depend.

Here note.ij. manner of belefes. First some there be which believe that those
things be true / which are spoken of god / even as a man does believe those
things to be true which he hears of the Turk / of the devil / and of
hell. This faith is rather a science / or a vain opinyon / then a sure trust
or belefe. There is an other faith toward god / that thou do not only
believe these things to be true which thou hear of god / but also trust to
him / and be take and committee thy self wholly unto him / besides that / to
presume upon him / beleuyng / without doubt that thou shall obteyn and receive
of him / that which thou hardest spoken of him / and that with such faith and
confidence as thou wooldest give to no man. Be it in case that the Turk (or
any other man) be gretely preysed unto the / and that thou believe faithfully
that some man is discrete / and wurthy praise / yet for all that thou will not
committee thy self unto him puttyng all thy trust and confidence in him.

But this faith which boldly betaketh him self to god / both in ieoperdye of
life and death / knowelegyng that he is such as he is spoken of makes only a
Christen / and obteyneth of god what so ever she desires nether is there any
false heart that receives this faith. For this is the quycke faith which is
required in the first commandment which says thus: I am thy god take no
strange gods. Wherefore this / in / is not put in vain / but it is to be
observed with a notable sygnificacyon. For we do not say / I believe to god the
father or of god the father / but I believe in god the Father / in Jesus Christ /
and in the holy ghost.

Wherefore this faith ought to be had in none but in one god / so that by this
we confess also the godhed of Christ and of the holy ghost / because we believe
none other wise in the son / and the holy ghost / then we do in the father,
him self. For even as we have one faith in all the three persons / so all the
three persons are only one god.

The first part of the belefe.
I Believe in God the father almighty / maker of heaven and earth.
That is / I forsake Satan and all ydolatrye / all charms witchecraftes and
false hope. I put my trust in no man of all the world / nether yet in my sylfe
/ not in my power / lernyng / science richesse / wisdom / or what thing so
ever it be / that I have or possess.

I put no confidence in any creature whether it be in heaven or in earth. But I
put my suer trust only in one god which can not be seen with man's eye /
which cannot be co^prehendend with man's wit / which made heaven and earth /
and alone rules all creatures, To him hoelly I submytte my sylfe. Nothing
fearyng / nor regardyng the malice of the deuell / and his felawes / for my god
is above them all. Nether would I put thelesse confidence in god / though all
men did forsake me and persecute me.

Nether will I trust him thelesse / because I am wretched and poor / because I
am rude and unlearned / because I am despised and lack possessions.

Nether yet the less because I am a sinner for this my faith does sarre pass
/ al things (as it is necessary and ought to do) what soever either be / or be
not / both sins and virtues and to be short / all things. So that she does
purely and hoely fix her self in God only / as the first commandment
teachith and compellith me.

Nether desire I any sign to tempt him I trust faithfully unto him / all
though he differ and tarry at his pleasure I will not set or prescribe to
him any end / any time / measure or reason but I commit all to his will / with
a pure faith and a stable. For he is almighty / what can I lack that he can
not give and do unto me?

For he is the maker of heaven and earth and lord of all things / what thing
can hyndre me or hurt me? How may it be that all things shall not turn to
mine use and profit / when he to, whom all these things ar subject and
obedyent favors me and loves me?

Now (sith he is god) he knows whereunto he has ordyned me / and how every
thing shall be best for me and that which he knows / he may do. If he be my
father / it is sure that he will se the best for me and that with a good will.

When I doubt not hereof and have such trust in him / then no doubt I on his
servant his son / and his heir for ever. And even as I believe se shall it
be unto me.

The secunde part of the belefe.
ANd in Jesus Christ / his only son our lord. Which was conceived by the
holy ghost / borne of Mary the virgyn. Suffered under Pontius Pylatus /
crucyfyed / deed / and buried / descended to hell / the third day rose ageyn
from death. Ascended to heaven / syttith on the right hand of God the father
almighty / from thens he shall come to judge quycke and dead,
That is / I do not only believe / that Jesus Christ is the true and only son
of God / by everlasting and godly nature / and being from the beginning and
ever begotten: but also that all things are subdued under him / and that he is
my lord / and the lord of all creatures / made ruler of them being man /
which he him self with the father in his diuynite did make.

I believe that no man may believe in god the father or may come unto the father
/ nether by science and lernyng nether by works / nether by their own reason
and wit or by what thing so ever may be named in heaven or earth / but by this
and in this Jesus Christ his only son / that is to say by the says in the
name and power of Jesus Christ.

I believe unfeignedly / and surely / that he was conceived for my proufit by the
holy ghost without all man's and carnal work / without a bodyly father / or
man's sede / and that to purifye / and make spiritual my sinful / flesshely
/ unclean / and dampnabill conception / and all theyrs that believe in him:
moved to his mercy of his own and fre will and the will of the almighty father.

I believe that he was begotten of the virgyn Mary without the loss of her pure
and vncorrupt virgynite / so that (according to the providence of the merciful
father) he should bliss and cleanse the sins and da^pnabill birth of all that
believe in him that after / it might do no hurt.

I believe that he suffered passion and death for my sins / and all theyrs that
believe in him / and that he thereby blyssed all passions / crosses and deaths /
so that after they might not hurt / but be both wholesome and merytorious.

I believe that he was dead and buried to mortifye and bury all my sins / and
theyrs that believe. Finally that all bodily death by his death was distroyed / so
that it is of no power to hurt but is rather made wholesome and profitable.

I belefe that he went down to hell to subdewe and make captyue / to me and to
all that believe / the devil with all his impery / subtilite and malice / to
deliver me from hell / taking awey all his power that he might not hurt me /
but should rather be profitable unto me.

I believe that on the third day he rose ageyn from death / to bring me and all
that believe in to a new life / and that by this deed he raised me with him /
in grace and spryte / not to sin after / but that I endowed with all kinds
of grace and virtue / might serve him / and so fulfull his commandments.

I believe that he ascended unto heaven / and that he has received of the father
/ rule / and honor above all aungelles / and creatures. And that he now
sittith on the right hand of the father / that is / that he is king and lord
over all the goods of godyn heaven hell and earth.

Wherefore he may help me and them that bileue / in all manner of aduersitees
against all our aduersares and enemies.

I believe that from thens he shall return the last day / to judge quycke /
whom he them shall find alive / and deed which before were buried. And that
he shall compel all men and aungelles good and euel to come before the seat
of his judgment (whom they shall se bodyly) to deliver me and all faithful /
from bodyly death / from all evil / and sins. And to punysshe with eternal
judgment his enemies / and adversaries / so that we shall be delivered from
their power for ever.

The third part of the belefe.
I Believe in the holy ghoost / the holy Christen church / the communyon of
saints / the forgiveness of sin / the rising / of flesh / and everlasting
life. Amen.
That is to sey / I do not only believe that the holy ghost is verey god with
the father and the son. But also that no man can come to the father by ceist
/ by his life / passion / death and what so ever who spoken of christ or opteyne
any of these things / without the work of this sprete with the which sprece
I desire the father and the son / to touch me and all faithful to stir me up
/ to call / to draw / and by Christ and in christ to quycken me to make me
holy and spiritual and so to bring me to the father / for it is he / which
with the father / by christ and in christ workith and quyckenyth all things.

I believe that in all the we ^ide / be hit never so great / there is but one
comune christen church which is none other thing but the co^gregacyon and
co^munyon of holy men that is of ryghtuous and faithful men on the earth And
that this church by this holy sprete is gathered and maintened. Thorough whom
also it is governed and increased daily by the sacraments and word of god.

I believe that no man can ever be saved / which is not found agreeable and
consenting with this congregation / in one faith in one word / in one
sacrament / hope and charity And that none of the Jews or gentyles can be
saved with this cherche except they reconcyle them self unto it / and come in
favor which it / confirmyng them selves in all points thereunto.

I believe that in this communion or Christen te all the prayers and good works
of this congregation do necessarily help me / way om my side and comfort me
in all times of life and death.

I believe that in this congregation and come^welth (and in none other place) is
gorgeuenesse of sins. And that without this all great and good works / how
many so ever there are of them do nothing profyt to forgiveness of sin. And
contrarywyse in this congregatyon / the multytute / greatness / and often
commyttyng of sins / do nothing hurt / nether let the forgheuenesse of
sin / but that this forgyuenesse does continue whersoeuer / and how song /
this excellent church does endure. To whom alsoo Christ ghyueth his keys /
and says in the xviij. of Mathewe what soever ye lose upon earth / it shall be
losed in heaven: likewise he says to Peter alone / in the name and stead of
this only one church in the, xvi. of Mat. Whatsoever thou lose upon earth it
shall losed in heaven.

I believe that there shall be arrysing of them that are dead / in the which
rising the holy ghost shall stir up all flesh / that is all men concerning
the body and flesh good and onell / so that the very flesh which was dead
buried and consumed or by other ways destroyed shall return / and live again.

I believe that after this resurrection shall be eternal life of good men / and
eternal death of sinners.

Of all these things I doubt not but every one of them shall come unto me from
the father by the son Jesus christ our lord with and in the holy ghost. Amen
that signifies that in good faith and without doubt all these things are
true.

The prayer of the lord called the Pater noster wheryn are contained.vij.
peticions.
The preface and introduccion to ar^ these.vij. peticions is contained in these
words.

Our father which art in heaven. The understanding of the words.
Almighty god since thou of thine intynyte benevolence and mercy have not only
admytted us / but also taught / ye and commanded by the only / and dear son
our lord Jesus christ that we (trusting in his mery^es and protection / he
being our intercessor) should believe that thou were a louig father unto us.
And that we should also call the father / though worthyly and by great right
thou might have been a cruel judge against us sinners which so often and
abhominably have done against thy godly and most holy will / and have given the
occasion of displeasure against us. Give us we beseech the / by the fame
beniuolence and mercy / that we may have in our hertes sure trust (without
fear) of thy fatherly love And make us fear this acceptable smelle and
swetnesse / which the most sure / and chyldly trust does get unto us / that
we may with glad mind call the father / knowledge / love / and cry on the in all leoperdyes keep us (I desire the) that we may continue thy loving children
/ and not deserve to make the most mekest father our horrible judge nor suffer
us not to be thine enemies / which ought to be thy children and heirs. Thou will also / not only symply / be called a father / but that we with a come^
voice should call the our father. And so with a special prayer of unity pray
for every man Wherefore give unto us anagreyng / and brotherly love / so that we
may perceive every one of us that we are truly brothers / and sisters / and
may pray to the as to our comen and merciful father / every on for other /
even as kind children entreat their father one for another. Grant / that
none of us seek that which is his own or else forget other / in thy sight: but
that (avoiding all hete / envy / and disce^tion / as it becomith the true
children of god) we may love to gyther with dew favor so that we may say
with a faithful heart not my father but our father. Sith truly thou art no
bodyly nor erthly father / whom we may se in earth / but art i^ hauyn our
spiritual father which dies not / nether are uncertain or doubtful / or such
which art not able to help thy self as is an erthly and bodyly father (whereby
it is evident unto us how much thou art a better father / which reachist
this te^porall father odes cu^trey / fre^des / richesse / flesh / and blood /
to be dispysed for the. Grant us dear father that we may be thy heuynly
children. Teach us to regard none other thing then our foul helith / and the
everlasting heritage / so that this te^porall country and worldli heritage
(which co^passeth and noyeth us / laboring to make us erthly and like unto it
self) deceive us not so that we may say truly and with a faithful here O
our heuynly father give us thy grace that we may be thy heuynly children.

The first peticion.
Thy name be hallowed.
O God almighty / our most dear heaven ye father / thy godly name / even now in
this time / in this vale of mysery (Alas for shame) so many ways is slaundered
/ with checkes / and iniuryes myserably rebuked / applied to many things
wheryn stondyth not thy honor and glory ye and many abuse it / to their
great confusion / which thing is so comen and often used / that this fylthy
life may well be called a slander and dishonesting of thy most gloryouse name.
Therefore endowe us with thy godli grace / that we may avoid such things as
are against the honor and praise of thy most holy name. Make thou all witther
aftes and falce charms shortly to decay. Cause all coniuringes by the which
satan or other creatures / are enchaunced to cease by thy blyssed name, Make
that all false faith by the which other we distrust the / or put more
confydence in other then is needful / may quyckly be distroyed Make that all
heresies and false doctrine which pretend a color of thy name / may
suddenly vanisshe a wey. Make that all hypocrisye or fayning of truth
ryghtuousnesse or holiness deceive no man. Make that no man swear by thy name
/ lie / or disseyue. Keep us from all falce hope / which under color of thy
name offers it self unto us. Keep us from spirytuall pride / from the vain
honor of worldly glory and name. Grant us that in all perils and hurt we
may call upon this thy holy name. Grant that in the straytenesse of
conscience / and ieoberdie of death we never forget thy blissed name. Grant /
that in our good words and works we may only praise and magnifye the / so
that we nether seek nor challenge to our self any name or honor / but to the
only whose (alone) are all things keep us from the most dampnabill sin of
unkindness.

Grant that by our life / and good works all other may be mouel to good /
and that they wurshyppe and praise nor us / but thy name. Grant that by our
evil works and sins no man may take occasion to slander thy name / or
dyminysshe thy praise. Keep us that we desire nothing either corruptyble or
everlasting / which should not return to the honor / and praise of thy
name And if we are anisuche here thou not our folysshenesse. Make that our
life be such that we may truly be found thy children / so that this thy name
father be not called in vain or falsely in us.

To this perte of prayer specially perteyn all psalms and prayers / with
which we praise / wurschippe / sing / give thanks to god and finally all the
praise of god.

The secunde peticyon.
Let thy kingdom come.
THis wretched life is the kingdom of all sins / and myscheffe whose lord
is the evil sprete / chief author / and gru^de of all malice and sin / But
thy kingdom is the kingdom of all grace and virtue / whose lord is thy best
beloved son Jesus crist the heed and beginning of all grace and virtue /
wherefore help us most dear father / and come again in favor with us. Give us
before all things true and constaunte faith in Christ hope (without fear) in
thy mercy / against all infirmytes of our weak conscience / and pure love
toward the / and all men. Keep us from infydelyte / desperatyon / and malice
/ which at the last might be the cause of our destructyon,

Make us to avoid the soul desire of lechery. Give us love to virgynyte / and
to all clennesse. Deliver us from dissentions bateylles / dyscorde and strife.
Make the virtues of thy kingdom to come and reygne withyn us. Give us peace /
concord and tranquylyte so that wrath / or any other vytternesse have not his
kingdom in us / but rather (through thy grace) the simple swetnesse / and
brotherly faith / all kind of frendshyppe / good manner / gentylnesse and
kindness. Grant us that the inordinate trouble and sykenesse of mind have no
place in us / but make the reioysyng and pleasure in thy grace and mercy rule /
and have dominion. And to be short / that all sin may be alienate from us /
and that we (replenyssed with thy grace / virtue and good works) may be made
thy kingdom / that all our heart / mind / and sense / with all our strength
inward / and outward may suffer them self to be ruled by the / to serve the /
thy commandments and thy will / not them self or the flesh the world or
the deuell. Make that this thy kingdom ones in us begone / may be encreasid /
go forward daily and grow lest the subtle malice / or fleuthe that we have
to goodness oppress us / lest we look back again and fall in to sin.

Give us a stable purpose and streyngth / not only to begin this good life /
but rather to proceed boldly in it and to perform it / as the prophet says.
Lighten mine ces lest I sleep or bewery i^ the good life ones begone / and so
mine enemy do bring me again into his power. Grant / that we may so continue.
And that thy kingdom which shall come / may fynysshe and perform this
kingdom which is begone by the. Deliver us from this parylouse / and synful
life. Make us desire the other life to come / and to hate this present life.
Give us grace not to fear death / but rather to desire it Put from us the love
and desire of this life / that so thy kingdom may fully be perfect in us. Of
this peticion are al psalms / verses / and prayers in the which grace and
virtue is desired of god.

The third petycion.
Thy will be fulfylleth in earth as it is in heaven.
IF our will be compared with thine it can never be good / but is ever evil.
Thy will is ever best specially / and much to be loved and desired: wherefore
have compassion upon us most dear father / and suffer nothing to be as we
would have it. Give us / and teach us / true and stable pacyence / when our
will is let and broken. Grant us that when any man speaks / holds his
peace / does / or leueth undone / any thing contrary to our will / that
therefore we be not wroth or angry / nether curse / compleyn / cry / or
murmr nether judge / nor conde^pne / ye that we defend not our self. Grant
that we may mekely give place to our adversaries / and them which let our
will / and so to dysanull our will / that we may praise / say well / and do to
them / as to chose which do perform thy godly and best will against ours.
Endowe us with thy grace that we may gladly suffrer all diseases / poverty
dispysinges / persequutions / cross / and aduersites: knoweleging that it is
thy will to crucyfye our will. Give us grace that we may suffer injury and that
gladly. Keep us from auengement. Make us that we quyte not evil for evil /
nether to avoid violence / by violence. But rather that we delight in thy will
(which brings us al these things) praise the / and give the thanks. Make
us that we impute it not to the deuell or evil men / when any aduersyte
chaunseth: but that we attrybute all unto thy godly will / which ordyneth all
such things / that our will may belief / and that blissednesse may increase
in thy kingdom, Give us grace that we may be glad / and merit to dye / and
that for thy will we may take our death gladli so that by fear nor infirmyte
we be not made disobyent unto the Make that all our members eyes / tongue /
heart / hands and fete / be not suffered to follow their desires nether that
we be at any time subdewed under them but that we (eue^ as taken and
emprysoned) may be broken in thy will and pleasure. Keep us from all evil /
misshe vous / obstinate / hard / styffe / vngentill / and resisting will.

Give de we obedience / parsait and freminde in all spiritual things / worldly
/ everlasting and transitory. Keep us from the most horribill sin of grugyng
slander / accusing and folisshe hardy judgment / that we conde^pne no man or
turn any thing to rebuke Put from us that abhominabill evil / and most grievous
stroke al such tongues / and teach us that if we se or hear of other any
thing worthy of rebuke / and which dyspleaseth us / that we hold our peace
and hyde it co^plenyng to the only / putting and committyng it unto thy will /
so that with all our mind we forgive them that offend us for whom also we
be sorry. Teach us to vnderstoud that no man may hurt us except be do him
self much more hurie in thy sighe so that we may be moved with mercy toward
him / rather then we should be provoked to wrath rather weeping for his
bli^denesse / then to think of aduengeme^t. Give us grace that we rejoice not
in their trouble / which have resisted our will or hurt us / or in what
point so ever their life displeasith us / and also that we be not sorry when
they prosper and have welfare.

Of this peticion are all psalms verses and prayers teaching us to pray for
our enemies / and against our sins.

The fourth peticion.
Give us this day our daily bread.
THe bread is our lord Jesus Crist which nourysseth / and conforteth the
soul. Therefore: O heavenly father / give us this grace / that the life of
Christ words / works / and passions / may be preached / known / and holden /
both of us / and of all the world. Give us grace that we may have his words
/ worltes and all his life for an affectuose example / and spectacle of all
virtues. Give us grace that i^ our passions and aduersytes / we may comfort
our self by his passion and cross. Give us grace that we may with a scable
faith overcome our death by his death / and follow without fear this nobil
capteyn into another life. Give this grace that all they that preach / may
proufitably and blissedly preach thy word / and Jesus crist through all the
world and that al whicke have thy word preached / may learn Crist and so may
be purified / and go forth in a better life. Grant this also merciful father
/ that all strange doctrynes in the which Christ is not learned may be thrust
out of thy church. Have mercy on all bisschoppes / prestes and on al them
whom they call consecrated / and of all officers that they may be lyghteneth
with thy grace / to teach and rule well / both in word and also cra^ple of
life. Keep all that are weke in the faith lest they be offended by the
myschevous exemple of heddes and rulers. Keep us from hereyses and doctrynes of
dyuision / that we may be agreyng in one mind / sith we use one daily bread
that is / one daily doctrine / and word of Christ. Teach us by thy grace / to
think / and have in mind / truly (and as we ought to do) the passion of
Christ / and to join it happyly with our life / so that we may come and
atteyn some thing / though it be but the shadow of it. Finally give us our
daily bread / that Christ in us and we in Christ may dwell perpetuelly / and
may worthyly bear this name / sith of Christ we are called Christen. Of this
peticyon are all kind of prayers and Psalms / with which we pray for our
officers / against false teachers / for the Jews / for heretics / and all
other that are out of the right wey. And also with which we pray for them
that lack ^onforte.

The fyft peticyon,
Forgive us our treaspaces even as we forgive them that trespass us.
THis prayer has a certain co^dicyon and sign annexed with him / which ^s
that first we forgive our trespassers. This done / then may we say forgive be
our trespasses. Before also in the third peticyon we prayed that the will of
God might be fulfilled / which wills that we suffer all things patiently /
not quytyng evil for evil / nether sekyng auengement / but that we do good
for evil / by thexample of our father in heuyn / which makes his son
shine upon good and evil / and sends his rain upon kind and unkind

This is now our prayer.
O father comfort our conscience / both now / and in the day of death /
which conscience now is abashed seeing his sin and iniquyre / and then
also shall be abashed / remembryng thy cruel judgment. Give thy peace into our
hearts that we (rejoicing) may look for thy judgment. Enter not into judgment
with thy strayte law / for in it shall no man be funde innocent and ryghtuous.
Teach us dear father not to stick or be comforted in our good works or
diseruynges / but to give and submytte our self plainly and faithfully to
thine iufinite and incomparable mercy. Again. Make that we despeyre not for
this our gylty and sinful life / but that we may iudgge thy mercy more
mighty and stronger then our life / how soever we have ordered it. Help and
comfort all men's conscience which in the point of death / or in any other
such temptacyon are vexed with desperacyon. Forgive them and us our de^ces /
comfort them / refresshe them / and he reconciled unto them. Give us thy
goodness for our malice / as thou co^maundest that we should do. Cast down
the horrible fend flaunderer / accusar / and encreasar / of our sins now
and in the point of death and to be short / in all straytnesse of conscience.
Give us grace to avoid that by our diffamacyon men's sins appear not the
more grievous, Judge us not after the accusacyon of the devil and our wretched
conscience / nether hear the voice of our enemies which accuse us day and
night before the / eue^ as we will not hear them which diffame and accuse
other. Take from us the grievous hepe of the sins in our conscience / so that
we refresshed by ^he suer trust and confidence of thy mercy in the botom of
our heart / may live / dye / suffer / and take all things pacyently. In this
peticyon take place all Psalms and prayers which against sins cry on the
mercy of God.

The sext peticyon.
And lead us not in to temptacyon.
WE are assauted with three manners of temptacyon and vexacyon / the flesh /
the world / and the deuell. Therefore we desire the most dear father to endowe
us so with thy grace that we may withstond the desires of the flesh. Make
that we resyst and fight against this super fluyte of meat / drink / sleep /
sloth / and ydelnesse. Make that we may bring him in to bondage and subiectyon
/ with fasting / temperate dyete / clothing / sleep / rest / watch and labor
/ so that he may be mete / and apt to good works. Make that with Christ we
may fastyn on the cross and mortifye his evil desires to lechery / all his
affections and instigations: so that we never consent or follow any his
temtations. Make that if by chance we look on a well made or fair man or
woman / or any other beutyfull image or creature / that they be not to us a
cause of temptacyon: But that the rather of them we may take occasyon to love
chastity / and to praise the in thy creatures. Make that when we hear any glad
or plesaunt thing / or feale any sweet thing that we seek not theryn our
delight and pleasure / but thy praise and glory. Keep us from this great sin
of covetousness / and desire to worldly richesse. Give us grace that we syke
not the rule and honor of this world / or consent to such desires. Keep us
that the false subtlety of this world the counterfayt bryghtnesse / and
entisementes of the same persuade us not to follow it. Keep us that we be not
drawn by the euylles and myseries of this world to impatience / auengement /
wrath / or to other such vices. Give us grace that we may despise the lies of
the world / colors / deceytes / promyses / and falshod. And to be short /
that we may forsake all that belongyth to him good and evil / as we have
promised in baptesme / and that we may continue in this purpose going forward
daily more and more. Keep us from the entysementes of the devil / that we
consent not to ^ryde / which would cause us to set mo^he by our self (and
despise other) for ry^hesse kynne power / science lernyng / beuty or any other
gifts or goodness. Keep us that we fall not in the sin of hate / and ^nuye
/ whate occasyon so ever we have gy^en unto us. Keep us that we doubt not ^n
thy faith / nether fall in desperation / no we / nor in the point of death. Put
thy helping hade our best heavenly father to them that fight and labor
against this hard and manyfolde temptacyon. Comfort them that now do sto^de
/ and lift them up that lie and are fallen. Finally fulfill us all with thy
grace / that in this miserabyll and perilous life (which is compassed with so
many co^tinuell enemies that never cease) we may fight boldly with stable and
noble faith / and obteyn the everlasting crown

The seventh peticyon.
But deliver us from evil.
This peticyon prays for all the euylles of pains and punyssheme^tes as does
the church in the letany.

O Father, deliver us from thy ever lasting wrath and punish mences of hell.
Deliver us from thy strayte judgment in death / and (...) the last day of
judgment. Deliver us from sondayne death. Keep us from the violence of water
and fire from lyghtnyng and hayle Keep us from hunger and derthe / keep us from
war and manslaughter. Keep us from thy most grievous strokes / the pestilence
/ french pockes / and such other diseases. Keep us from all evil and
perilles of the body. Reserved that in all these things / be the glory of thy
name / encreace of thy kingdom / and fulfylling of thy will.

Amen.
Grant us good lord that all these prayers may be obtained of us with oute^
douthe. Nether suffer that we my strust any thing / but that in all these
things we shall be herd / ye be herd all ready. And let all these things be
sure and with out any doubt. So may we with glad here say / amen / that is to
say stable / constant / true and s^er.

The salutacyon of our Lady called Aue Maria.
HEre take heed no man put his sure trust and hope in the mother of god or her
merytes / for this sure trust is dew to god only / as the chief and only
worship with which we are commanded to honor only god. The favor which
was given to her of god / gives us an occasyon to praise god / and give him
thanks, We ought none otherwise to praise and love her / the^ one which has
received such goodness without her own deseruyng of the pure liberalyte and
favor of God / even as she her self does knowelege in the song Magnificat.
For as I am moved by the sight of heaven / the son / or other creatures to
commend and preyse the maker / and put them in to my praise / and prayer /
saying. O good lord which have made such a bright and goodly creature give I
pray the. etc.

So in this place in our prayer we fette the mother of god / and say. O
gloriouse god what a noble virgyn haste thou made / blessed and preysed be she.
And thou lord which haste so glorified and exalted her / grant I desire the
also to me. etc.

So that our heart consyst not in her / but may go forth by her to Christ and
to god hi^ self. Wherefore the prayer is also made on this manner that it gyuer
all to god when we say / hayle Mary full of grace / the lord is with the /
blyssed art thou among wyme^ and blyssed is the trute of thy womb Jesus
Christ. Here thou seyst that in these words no peticyon but pure praises and
honors are contained / like as in the beginning and first words of the
Pater noster is no peticyon / but only prase and declaring of the godly favor
and majesty that he is our father and in heaven. Therefore we can not call this
salutacion a peticyon or any prayer / because it is not laufull for us / to
expound these words for there then they sound / and then the holy ghost did
make them. How be it we may entreat of this salutacyon diverse manner of
ways. First as a meditacyo^ / that we may in this remember the grace which
god gave / her. Secundly that we may desire also that she may be known and
exalted of al men / for she was full of grace / whereby it is known that she
had no sin imputed to her / and this was a special favor of God / to be
full of all goodness and void of al evil Thirdly / that she is blyssed among
all wymen / not for that alone that she brought forth her child without
labor and pain / otherwise then Eua / and other wyme^ but also because she
conceived fruit without sin / and that bodyly fruit by the holy ghost /
which was given to none other woman. Fourthly that her fruit was blyssed and
preserved against the curse which did fall upon all the children of Eve
because they were all conceived in sin / and borne gylty of death and
dampnacyon. But this only fruit of her womb alone be blyssed / in the which
fruit all we are blyssed. Fyftly here may be added a peticyon and desire / that
we may pray for them which say evil by this fruit and mother. But who are
these that say evil by them? truly they which persequute and curse / his
word (which is the gospel) and the faith of Christ / as now a days do the
Jews and papists. Of the which it follows / that in this season / no man
does so much blaspheme this mother and his son: as they that mumble up so
many rosaryes / and ever have in their mouth / Aue Maria. For these be the
chief capteyns which curse and blaspheme the word of God / and the faith of
Christ.

Wherefore note / that this mother and her son be said well by.ij. manner of
ways carnally and spiritually. Carnally with the mouth only and words of
this salutacyon which are Aue Maria. And these be they which thiefly of all
do curse and blaspheme them. Spiritually with the heart when we do praise her
son Jesus Christ in all his words / works and passyo^ / and say well by him.
When we are gladly content to suffer persecucyo^ / for his trouthes sake /
rather then to forsake it. When for his sake we are content to love our
neyboure as our self But this can no man do except he be inspired with pure
and true faith. For without this faith can no heart be good / but rather of
nature full of curses and rebukes / toward god and all his saints. Therefore
I would counceyl him that lacks this faith to absteyne from this salutacyon
ye and from all manner prayers / for of them it is wryte^ in the hundred and
eight Psalm / his prayer be turned in to sin.

Consolacyon for troubled consciences.
THappostel Paul in the.xv. to the Romans (going about to describe the
co^fortes of Christen) says Whatsoever things are written a fore time are
written for our lerning that we thorough pacyence and comfort of the scripture
should have hope whereby he teaches pleynly that we must seek our comfort out
of the holy scripture.

Now does his scripture use.ij. figures of comfort / setting forth and
declaryng unto us.ij. images of evil and good things myxte in a dew and most
wholesome temperature. As the wise Ecclesiastique says. In the day of euylles
remember good things and in the day of good things remember evil things.
Well knows the holy ghoost that every thing is of such value and power to a
man / as his mind and oppynion is in it. For that which in his oppinyo^ie
vile and of no reputacyon / he casts but little love unto it / if it chance
to him and little regards if it fall from him, Therefore his labor is to
pluck and call awey a man from this mind and opinion of this worldly
possessions. This done: now are all things indifferent / how be it sith this
calling awey is chiefly done by the word of God (whereby thoppinyon is reuocate
from the thing which presently is desired / to the thing which is absent and
not desired) of verey right we shall have confort of nothing but scripture /
which in the day of euylles calls us to look for goodness which other is
present or to come / and in the day of goodness to look for evil. How be it
that we may know these visyo^s and images the better we shall divide each of
them in to.vij. parts. The first image shall have euylles which shall be
considered: first with in him self. Secundly before him / thirdly / after him
/ fourthly byside him in the lift hond / fyftly on his right hond. syxtly /
beneth him, Seuently / above him.

The first chapter of the first image which is the inward evil.
THis is sure stable and most true (whether man believe it or not) that there
can be no vexacyon and punysshement so great in man / but that there is him
both evil and iniquite much worse. So abundaunt and copiouse are his euylles
which he fealeth not. If truly he did feale his evil / he should feale very
hell / for he has hell in hi^ self. Thou will are how? The prophet says
every man is a liar. And ageyn / Every man living is all vany^e. To be vain
and a liar is to be void of truth / and to be void of truth is to be with out
god / and to be nothing. And that is to be in hell / and dampened. Therefore God
chastynyng us mercyfully does open and put on us our casier and lyghter
offenses knowing that if he should led and bring man to know his hole misery
/ he should perisshe within a little space / howebeyt he has caused some to
feale and taste their own of whom it is written / he leads down to hell /
and brings ageyn. Wherefore they say well / which call the bodyly passions
certain warnynges and monisshementes of the evil / which lies with in. And
thappostel in the.xij. to the Ebrewes calls them the fatherly instructions
of God ^ayng / he scourges every son that he rece^ueth / which he does that
by these scourgy^ges and little euylles / he may expel the great euylles /
lest after he be compelled to feale them / as it is written in the.xxij. of the
proverbs / folisshenesse is bound to gyther in the heart of the child / but
the rod of correccyon shall avoid it. Do not kind fathers more lament their
chylder if they be thieves or evil them if they be wounded, yeis / they the^
selves do beat them and wound them that they should not be evil. Whace then
lettyth that this abominable evil with in us is not felt? truly as I said /
the providence of god that man (considering his inward corrupcyon and vice)
should not perisshe. For he hydeth them / wylling that by only faith they
should be seen perfectly though he does show some part of them by a sensyble
evil. Therefore in the day of euylles remember goodness. Consider how good
it is / not to know thine hole evil. Remember well this goodness / and thy
sensyble evil shall the less vex the.

And contrary in the day of goodness remember euylles / that is / when thou
do not feale thy true euylles / yet se thou be not unkind / but remember thy
true euylles / and so shall thou feale the less thy sensyble euylles. Therefore
it is euydent that in man there is rather lack of sorrow then sufficyent
sorrow in this life / not because that his evil is not present before him /
but because the affection / opinion and mind of it is not present which
through the goodness of god is hydden.

For we may se them to whom it is given to know their hole iniquite / how
fearse and cruel they are against them self how they regard not to suffer
thorough all their life / whate thing so ever it were / so that they felt not
their hell and mysery.

Even so would every man do / if he either knew or did believe suerly his
inward evil he would of his own will call unto him outward euylles / ye /
rejoice in them / and be no more sad for them / then though he were in all
prosperyte and felt no tribulacyon as some holy men have done / among the
which David was ^^e Psalm.C.vi.

Therefore the first comfortable image ^s / to say unto him self. O thou man yet
thou fealest not thine evil / be glad and give th^nkes that thou act not
compelled to feale (...) so thine evil in comparyson of that g^^^t evil is
but light and easy / and that it is t^^t some say, I have deserved much
wors^^e hell / which is sone said / but it is into^erable to felt. And this
evil / though it ^e^ruer so hid and secret / yet he bryng^^h forth his fruit
sensibly / which is fear^^^ and wavering of the fearful consciences / by ^^e
which faith is fore beseged and assa^^^ed while that man douteth and is
vncert^^n whether god be mercyful unto him or not and the weaker this fruit is
/ the more ^^tter is this fruit.

And this only infyrmite / if he be well co^sydered and looked on / sith it is
spiritual does far pass al bodyly trouble / and makes it to seem but a
trifell / if that they be well compared to gither.

Besides this all that the church speaks of when she reherseth so often vanite
and afliction of the sprete / perteyne to the inward euilles. What counseyles
do we take in vayn ^howe many of our purposes are mocke^? how many things se
we? how many hear we: that we would neither se nor hear / and these things
that some time make for our purpose some time are against it (...) so much
that nothing is hole and perfait Furthermore / the more honor and dignite ^
man is set in the more and greater are his tra^sgressions / and the more is hes
vexed with hetes / waves / and other storms above all other / so that
the.C.iij. psalm may well say The rear in the sea of this world (...) bestes /
and great / and treapyng wor^^^ / without nombre that is to say / infinite
^indes of temptations / so that for this cause Job in the.vij. calls a man's
life no thing but temptacyon.

And these are not therefore the less euil^ because they be but little fealt but
because they are so in use and familier with us we set the less by them.
And therefore (as god would also it should be) they move and trouble us but seide
/ all though we can not fully dispyse and forget them. And true it is that we
feale and perceive sca^t the thousand part of dure euylles. And yet we feale
not those according to the truth and greuousnesse of them / but measure them
by our opinion / affection / and mind.

The secunde chaptre of the secu^de image / which is the evil to come or
before a man.
IT shall not a little easy thy present evil what soever it be if thou turn
thy mind to consider things to come / which are so many and of such
efficacyte / that unto them is only ascribed the great and grievous passyo^ of
mind called fear. For thus some diffine it. Fear is a passyo^ of the mind
about evil to come i^ so much that cappostel says / go not about to sa
favor hyge things but fear. And the more uncertain this evil is / the
greater it is / in so much that it is a common proverb there is none age paste
the stable altough this disease belong to chylder and babes.

Do that by this ye may gather / that there is no man sure and fre / from any
other man's infirmyte. But what soever one man suffers the same may an other
suffer also. To this pertayne all stories and tragedyes of all worlds / and
all the compleyntes of this world. To this also may be applied that certain
men have observed more then iij. hundredth diseases with the which man's bodi
may be vexed If the^ there be so mani diseases / how many accydentes think
thou are there that may chance upon our goods and upon our fre^des? How
many enco^brau^ces and turme^tes of the soul which is the princpall ground
wherein consist all these euylles / and the only receauer of sorrow and
sadness. And the greater a man is and in the more dignite / the more the
streyngth and fealinge of this evil increases And were rayneth poverty /
slander and such other (sith they may sone chance) it is needful that they
be feared every hour / even as though they did hang over us / by a little
threde. Like as the sword which dyonisius the tiraunt did ha^ge over his
geestes hedes Of all these things whatsoever does not chance unto the count
it for a vanurage / and as it were for a comfort of the evil which thou art
stricken with all / that also here thou may be compelled to say with Hieremas.
It is the merci of god that we are not consumed For which so ever does not
come unto us / it is kept of by the strong hond of god / which compasses us
with such power and might (as it is showed in Job) that Satan and other
euylles are wroth that they are kept from us Therefore we se how swetely god
shuldt be loved when any thing chances to us For this most loving father
warns us) b^ this one evil) to behold how many euylles are about to
subdue us / if he dit not defend us as though he should say / satan and the
hole hell of euylles pursue to subdue the / but I have prescribed and set the
end of the sea / and have said unto him / hither shall thy swelling waves and
come here shall they ceate / and be broken / as he says in the.xxxviij. of Job.

But be it paraduenture that god will that none of them shall come / yet at the
lest that which is called most fearful of all (that is death) shall suerlye
come and nothing so vnsuer as his time and hour / which evil truly is so
great, that we may se many me^ which had lever live and continue with all
those euilles / them ones do dye to have them all fynisshed. And to this one
(contempnyng all other) scripture puts fear / saying / remember thy last
end and thou shall never sin. To this se how many meditacyons: how many
books: how many means: how many remedies: are ymagined / that by the memory
of this one evil they may fear us from sin / make us dispyse the world /
alleuiate our passions / and euylles / and comfort them that are vexed / by
the comparyson of this horrible and great evil / which for all that is
necessary. There is no man which would not desire to suffer all euylls / if
he might by those avoid death / for death holy men did fear ye Christ him self
went to his death with fear and bloody drops of swette. Finally so horrible
is this evil that the mercy of god never took more diligence / then to
comfort our weakness in this matter / as we shall se hereafter.

All those things are common and indifferent to all men / even as the benefytes
of health are common to them that are vexed. How be it to the christen there is
a new and special cause / to fear this evil to come which does far pass
all other euylles. And this is it that thappostel deschry^eth.i. Corin.x.
saying. Let him that thinks that he stondeth take heed / lest he fall The
wey is so slypper and our enemies so mighty / armed with out own powers (that
is to sey with the socoure of our own flessh and of all our evil desires)
acco^panyed with the infinite multitude of the world / with deuities and
pleasures on the reght hand / with fearsnesse / crueltye of me^ and
displeasures on the lift hand / besides the craft of subtlety and a thousand
weyes to hurt / deceive and destroy / which he is instruct with al him
self. Thus live we / being not sure to continue one mynute of an hour in our
good mind and purpose.

Saint Cipriane remembering many of these things in a pistle which he made of
mortalyte / does teach that it is good to desire death / as a quycke helper to
escape these euylles. And truly when these men were in a good mind / and did
entreat of these infinyte ieopardyes / we do se them (dispysynge life and
death that is to say al these foresaid euylles) desire to dye and to be
dyssolued / so that they might be loosed from the multitude of sins / that
are in them (as we have said in the first image) and into which they may
fall of the which we speak now. And truly these.ij. things are verey
ryghtuouse both to desire death / and also to set light by all these euylles /
ye utterly to dispyse them / if god stryke the or move the with one of them /
for it is te gift of god to be moved with them. What true Christen is there
which would not desire to be diseased / ye and to dye / which seyth and
fealeth him self while he is hole to be in sin / and that he may continuelly
run into more and daily fall in them / and so to transgress the special
and good will of his most dear father.

With this here and indygnation was Paul vexed and sturred up (in the unto
the romans) when he had compleyned that he coud not do to good wicht he would
have done / but that he did the evil which he would not have done / he cried
out. O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from this bodi of death the
grace of god (he said) by Jesus christ / he does little love god his father
which does not hate more the evil of sin then he does death / since that god
did ordeyn death for this purpose / that it might at the length fynysshe this
evil of sin / so that death may be the mynistre of life and ryghtuousnesse /
of the which we shall speak hereafter.

The third chapter of the thyrdey mage / which is the evil that is passed or
behind us.
IN this chiefly / above all other does the sweet mercy of god our father
shine and set forth it self which is abyll to comfort us in all veracyon /
and ieoperdyes. Nether is there any man which fealeth the hand of god more
ready with him then when he does rehearse and meditate the years of his life
past. Saint Austine says / if that the choice were given to a man / that he
should other dye or else to live his life passed again / as he has lived it /
that he would chose rather to dye: seeing his great ieoperdies and euilles
whice (scarcely and with great peril) he has escaped which opinion is verey
true if it be well extemed. Here he may se how often he has done many things
with out study and regard / ye clean contrary to his purpose. And has also
suffered many things with out counceyll and provision before they were done and
when they were done / in so much that (merueyling with him self) he is
compelled to say how are these things come to pass / which I never thought
to do but rather contrary. So that the proverb is found verey true / man
purposes / and god dysposeth / that is to sey brings to pass other things
then man does purpose. So that by this one text it is more evident then we can
deny / that our life and goods ar governed by the high and merueillous
power / provision / and goodness of god / and not by our own wisdom.

Here we may perceive how often god has been with us / when we have nether seen
nor felt him. And how true it is that Petre says he takes the charge and
prouydeth for all us. Wherefore if there were nether books nor preachinges / yet
our life her self which is led thorough so mani perils and ieoperdies
may abundauntly testyfie and comend us the godly goodness / most ready and
swetist / which has taken up and borne us in his bosom far beyond all our
provision and wit. And as Moses in the.xxxij. Deuteronomyon says. The lord
has kept him as the ball of his eye he has led him about and borne him on
his shulders.

And of this spring all the exhortacions in the psalter / I have remembered the
old days. I have considered in meditacion all these works and creatures. I
shall remember from the beginning all thy merueilles. And I have remembered thy
iugeme^tes and am comforted. These and such other perteyne herunto that we
may surely know since that he was them present with vo when we saw him not /
nor thought it / that he is also now present with us / while he semith to us
to be abse^t For he that took us in such necessite with out our consent will
not forsake us in a little trouble though he seem to leave us / as he says in
Esaie. I have forsaken the for a mynytte and little space / and in great mercy
will gather the again and receive the. Here may thou put in these things /
who was he that took the charge of us / so many nyghtes while we were slepyng.
Who was he that took thought for us as often as we labored / played / and did in
the other infinyte things / in the which we look no thought for our self.
Or how long is the time / in the which we ^ake regard to our self The
Covetous man takes thought to seek money / yet in the seking and laboring for
it / it is necessary that he put a part his though. So we may so that all our
care (wether we will or not) retourneth only to god / and verey seldom it is
that we are left in our own prouysion / which yet sometime god does suffer /
that he may learn us to know his goodness that at the length we may perceive
what great difference there is between his provision and ours. So it chances
/ that he will suffer us sumtyme te be stryken with some light disease / or
other evil faynyng as though he help us not (how be it in deed he does ever
help us) but yet he forbyddeth that those which are about us / assaut us not
so fyersly that they suppress us / so to tempt us as his dear children /
whether we will commytte to his prouysyon all the resydue of our life and to
se how weke and vnproufitable our care and provision is / what do we? y^ / or
what can we proufit our self in all our life? which are not a bill to heal
shortly a little ache in the thyghe: why then are we so hasty to berydde in a
moment from our parylles and euilles? and leave not rather to him the charge
and cure of it / fyth that by him we are delivered (our own self beryng
witness) from so many euylles and kept without our oune provision. To know
these things is to know the works of god / to considre and remember his
works / and by that remembrance to be comforted in all aduersitees. They that
know not this shall run into the danger that there is spoken of in the
Psalm.xxviij. Because they have not understand the works of god and the
works of his hondes thou shall destroy them / and not edyfye them. For they
are unkind to the hole provision of god given them in all their life / which
in all little minycte commit not to him the hole charge and provision.

The fourth chapitre of the fourth image which is the evil beneth us.
YEt we se none other thing i^ all the euilles that we suffer the^ that the
goodness of god is so great and so ready with us that among the i^numerabyl
euylles with which we are compassed on eueri side / ye and in which we are
fulli prisoned sca^ta few (nor they at al times) are suffered to assail us /
in so much that the evil wherewith we are suppressed is but a warninge of a
great advantage with which god endueth us / while that he suffers us not to be
oppressed with the multitude of euilles with the which we are beseged.

What a miracle is it for a man to bestryke^ at on every side with infinite
strokes / and chance at the length to be touched but with one? ye it is a
great grace that he is not stryken with them all / and a miracle that he is
not touchet with many. Therefore the first of those euylles which are by neth
is death The secunde is hell / if we should consider the diverse and vile death
of other men / wherewith synnars are stryken / we shall seen perceive with how
great lucre we suffer less then our deseruinges. How many are strangled with
halters / galowes / and water / or dye with sword / which paraduenture have
done much less sins then we have done.

In so much that their ^^th and mysery may be leyd before us of Christ for an
image and glass wheryn we may perceive / whate we have deserved For so he
answered in the.xiij. of like / when there were present that showed him of the
galyleans whose blood pylate myngled with their own sacrifice. Suppose ye
that these galyleans were gretter synnars then all other galyleans because they
suffered such punysshement? I tell you nay / but except ye repent / ye shall
all in like wise perisshe. Or think ye that those.xviij. Upon whom the coure
in Siloe fill and slew them / were sinners above all men that dwell in
Jerusalem? I tell you nay / but except ye repent ye al shall like wise
perysshe.

Nether can we think that we ought less to be punysshed / which have
committed as great or gretter crimes. Nether the justice and truth of god will
be for our cause other unequal or false / which has or dyned to give to
every man acordyng to his deeds / if we do not prevent and at the lest suffer
some little evil pacyently that is given us of god most mercyfully for a
warnyng / to exchewe the gretest evil.

How many thousands are there in hell / and everlasting dampnation which
have not the thousand part of our sins: how many virgyns? children? and
which we call innocents? how many religious prestes? and married men? which
seemed through all their life to serve god / and peradventure / falling into one
sin are dampened perpetually. We will not dissemble. There is one
ryghtuousnesse of god i^ every sin. He hates equally and conde^pneth sin
in who so ever it be found. May we not here se the inestymable and bounteous
mercy of god / which has not dampened us that so often have offended? how much
I pray the is it that we can suffer in all our life? to be compared to
everlasting pain / which they suffer / deseruyng it b^one transgression. And
yet we which have so often transgressed are saved. Truly it is a great
unkindness and extreme hardness of unbelieve / that we so little regard and so
coldly magnifye these high benefytes of god. Bysydes this hither thou may
apply / so many infydelles / natyons / Jews / infauntes / tho whom if the
grace had been given which is given to us / they should not be in hell but in
heuyn and should much less have sinned the^ we have. For Crist in the.xi. of
Mathewe s^t^^^h this image before our yes saying / woe be to the Chorosaym / woe
be thou. Both sayd^ for if the miracles which were showed in you had been
showed in tire and Sydon they had repented long a gone in sackeclo the and
ashes. Nevertheless I say to you it shall be easyer for Tire and Sidon at the
day of judgment then for you. And thou Caphernaum wyiche art lift up unto heuyn
/ shall bethruft down unto hell for if the miracles which have been done in
the had been showed in zodom: they had remained to this day. Nevertheless I say
unto you / it shall be easier for zodom in the day of judgment / then for the.
We se therefore how much praise and love we owe unto our mercyful god in all
the euylles of this life / because it is scant one drop of that we have
deserved. Which Job compares to the sea and the gravel of the sea.

The fyfte Chapter of the fyfte image which is the evil on the lift hond.
HEre set before thine yies the hole keep and multitude of adversaries and
evil men. And first consydre in them how many euylles they have not done /
to our body / goods / name and soul / which they would have done / except
(by the prouisyo^ of god) they had been let. And the higher any man is in
tale and auctorite the more ready at hond he is to be vexed / with the deceytes
/ soutteltyes flaunders and te^ptacyons of his adversaries. And in all these
things we may understand and prove the hand of god most ready to deliver us.
And whate merueyll is it though sometime we be vexed with one of these euylles?
After this consider the euylles which are appropryate unto our adversaries:
not to be glad or rejoice in them / but rather to suffer with them / and to
be sorye for they are subject indifferently to these euylles as well as we / as
we have showed before.

But in this they are more wretched that they are separate from our company
both bodyly and spiritually. This evil which we suffer is nothing to theyrs /
for they are in sin in unbelieve / under the wrath of god unto the power of
the deuell wretched bondmen of ungodliness and sin in so much that if the
hole world would curse and banne them: they can desire no worse unto them.
This well considered / we shall love perceive with how much gretter love we
ought to suffer this little disease of the body / in the faith / in the
kingdom of Christ / and in the service of God / which in thabundaunce of
these co^modytees and virtues ought scant to be fealt. Their mysery also so
ought to be so rowed in a Christian and meke heart / that his sorrow seem not to
be paynfull / but rather pleasure unto him. For so commands Paul in the
secunde to the Philippians / let every man co^sydre not whate is in him self /
but whate is in other men / let the same mind be in you which was in Christ
Jesus which being in the shape of god / took on him the shape of a servant /
that is to say with a meke and a low mind put on him our shape / orderyng
him self none otherwise in our euylles then if they had been his own. So
forgettyng his godhed and other pleasures he made him self of no reputacyon /
that he might be found in every point like man / separatyng nothing that man
had from him / but only sin / submyttyng him self to all other infirmytees.
The holy men (streyngthed with this mind and sturred up with this image) were
wont to pray for evil men / ye and for their enemies. And to do all things
accorddyng to the example of Christ forgettyng their own iniuryes or
ryghtuousnesse / taking thought how they should deliver them from their
euylles. And with this werre mothe more trouble / then with their own bodyly
euylles.

As Saint Petre wrytteth of lot in the secunde Chapitre of the secunde Epistle
he being ryghtuous / and dwelling among them / in seeing and hearing / vexed
his ryghtuous soul from day / to day with their unrighteous deades.

Here thou seyst whate a depth of euylles appears and whate occasyon is given
to be merciful and to suffer with them / and utterly to despise our little
inco^modyte / if the charity of god be in ve / and how God will let us suffer
nothing in co^paryson to these that they suffer. The cause that these things
do b^^ tytell move us is this

The lie of our heart is not pure enough where with we should se how great
shame and mysery it is for a man to lie under sin / that is to say to be
forsaken of God / and possessed of the deuell. Who is so hard hearted that will
not pytye the myserabyll co^dicyon of them which lie before the church / and
in the streates with deformed faces / their noses eaten of / their iyes out /
and other of their members consumed with matter / fylthe / and corrupcyo^ / in
so much that the sense can not only abide to behold it / but also the mind
does abhor to remember it. And whate means god by these lamentable mo^stres
of our flessh and likeness but to open the iyes of our mind that we may
perceive with whate en horrible facyon the soul of a synnar shows out his
matter and corrupcyon / though he him self walk in purpyll and in gold /
covered with roses / and lylyes / as though he were all ready in paradise. But
how many sinners are there in the world in co^paryson of one of these deformed
persons: Truly these infynite euylles / both in gretnesse and in no^bre
dispysed i^ our neighbors do cause ours (though, it be but one and that
verey small) to seem to us verey great and detestable. How be it also in
bodyly tribulacyo^s they are in worse co^dicyon them we are. For I pray ye what
thing can be to them sweet and acceptable (though they had and might obtain
all things that they desired) seeing that their conscience can not be quiet:
is there any thing more abominable then a grudgyng or biting conscience For
Esaye says in the.lvij. Chaptre: the wicked are as the boiling see / which
can not be quiet and his floudes do habound into subjection and mourning. And
the lord god says / there is not peace (which is the verey tranquyllite of
conscience) unto the wicked. Therefore thou may se that verefyen in them
which is written in the xxviij. of Deuteronomyon. The lord shall give the a
fearful heart / and deceauyng iyes and a soul consumed with sorrow / and thy
life shall be hangyng before the / and thou shall fear day and night / and
thou shall not trust thy life / in the morning thou shall say who shall give me
the euentyde. And in the euenyng / who shall give me the morning? Because of
the fear of thy heart / for thou wal^ be feared / and for those things which
thou shall see with thine yies. Finally he that did consider with a good mind
the uttermost point of euylles / other of his enemies or of his friends / he
would not only forget his own troubles thinkyng him self that he suffered no
thing / but would also with Moses and thappostell Paul break out and desire
that it might be leful for him to dye for them and to be made cursed from
Christ / and to be put out of the book of life (as it is written in the.ix. to
the Romans) that they might be delivered and saved. Christ burning with this
sire and love both dyed and went down to hell for us leuyng us an example that
we also should take thought for other men's harms / forgettyng our own / ye
rather desyring our own.

The syxte Chapitre of the syxt image which is the evil on the right hand.
ON our right hand are our friends by whose euylles and vexations our
troubles are mitygated and aswaged as Saint Petre teachet in the fyft of the
first Pistle saying. Resyst the deuell stedefast in the faith / remembryng
that ye do but fulfill the same affliccions / which are appointed to your
brethren that are in the world. So the co^gregacyon of christian areth in
their prayers / that they provoked be the examples of holy men / may follow
the virtue of their passions / and syngeth solemply / that the holy men have
suffered turmentes / that they might suerly come to the victory of martyrdom.
By the which words and songs of the church we must understood that the
passions and victoryes that God has given to his martyrs and holy saints /
ought to be had in memory / that by their example we may be quykened and
bolded to suffer those euylles which they suffered. And if their commemoracyon
be by us done to any other intent / whatsoever it be / then is it meddled with
supersticyon and hypocrisy. As is theyrs that honor them to the intent that
they should not suffer the trouble and vexacyo^ / which the saints by their
example and memory do teach to be suffered / so that they desire to be made
unlike unto them / whose feasts they celebrate. Right excelle^tlye does
thappostle entreat this place of comfort in the.xij to the Heb. saye^ge: ye
have not yet resysted unto blood shedi^ge striui^ge against sin

And ye have forgotten the consolacyon / which speaks unto you as unto
chyldern. My son despise not the chastenynge of the lord / nether saint when
thou art rebuked of him: for who^ the lord loves him he chasteneth. If ye
shall endure chastenynge god offers him self unto you / as unto sons /
what son is that whom the father chasteneth not? If ye be not under
correccyo^ (whereof al ar part takers) them are ye bastardes and not sons.
Moreover seeing we have fathers of our flesh which corrected us / and we
gave theyme reverence: shall we not much rather be in subieccyon unto the
father of spiritual gifts / and live? No manner learning for the present time
semych to be joyous but grievous / nevertheless afterward it brings forth
the quiet fruit of ryghtuousnesse unto them / which there in are exercysed.
These were the words of saint Paul. Who would not be abashed of these words
/ where he diffyneth plainly / that they are not the sons of god / which
are not under his lernyng and correccyon Who can more strongly be confirmed /
and more effectuouslye be comforted / then he that hears that they are loved
of god which are chastened / and that they are the sons of god / and endued
with the co^munyon of holy men / ye they only are holy which suffer and are
chastened. This vehement exhortscyo^ should make sufferaunce and correccyon to
be loved and desired. Here is no place to excuse our self / that some suffer
less some more for to every man is given temptation by measure / not above
our streynght as it is written in the.lxxix. psalm. Thou shall feed us with
the bread of tears / and give us drink in theares / in measure / which Paul
does also say. God is faithful which suffers you not to be tempted / for
there the^ ye be able: ye he will put such chance unto the temptacyon that ye
may be able to resyst. Therefore where as the gretter evil and temptacyo^ is /
there is the more comfort and help of god. So that the inequalyte of trouble
and temptacyo^ is but only in the face outwardly and not in the verey thing.
When we now at this day remember John Baptist shamefully slain and behedded
of Herod / does it not confound us and make us abashed? that he being such
one (as among the children of wymen there arose not a gre^ter) the only friend
of the spouse the prepare of christ's wa^e / gretter them all the prophets /
was nether slain by any open judgment / nether yet for any feigned cause (as
Christ was accused) nether for to avoid insurreccyon of the people. But was
beheded in prison at the appetyte of a dauncetesse / the daughter of a wretched
aduoutrous woman. Let then the shameful death / of such an holy person such
an holy life of such a Prophet / so wretchedly and vilaynously delivered into
the cruel ho^des of a rybaud that was angry with him swage and pacyfye al our
evil / where was god which suffered eue^ before his eyes such an horrible
deed? Where was Christ which hearing of it spoke never a word? He dyed as
though he had been unknown to god / men and all creatures. What suffer we in
the which we may rejoice? and not rather be utterly confounded and asshamed if
it be compared unto this man's death. Or how shall we be bold to show our
faces / if we will suffer nothing / sith such holy men have suffered such
vile death without deseruyng / ye and their bodies after their death has been
made a laughing stock to their enemies. Behold (says Ieremyas) they which
had no judgment to drink of the cup / drinkyng shall drink of it / and
shall thou be lest innocent? thou shall not be left innocent / but drynking
thou shall drink of it. Therefore the heremyte did well which because he was
wont every year to have sykenesse / and escaped one hole year without sykenesse
/ was very sad and wept / sayng that God had forgotten him / and had denied
him his grace. So necessary and wholesome is the correccyon of the lord to all
christian Here we se how it is nothing that we suffer / if we compare it to the
prisons / Iron / fire / bestes / water / and other infynite torments / ye if
we ponder well the grievous persecutyons of them which suffer the temptacyons
of the deuell being present with us in this life. For there are many which
are suffer more sharply and greuouslye them we do / both in sprete and body.
Here some man will say in this I co^pleyne / that my passion cannot be compared
to the passions of holy men / because I am a sinner / not worthy to be compared
unto them.

They suffered gylties and for innocencye but I suffer for my sins / therefore
it ^s no merueyle though they suffered all things pacyently and gladly. This
saying is verey folisshe / for if thou suffer for thy sins thou may rejoice
that thy sins be purged. Where not the holy men also sinners? but thou
fear lest thou be like unto Herod or to these which honge on the left
hand.

Thou art not if thou be pacyent / what thing makes the difference between the
thief on the right ho^de and the thief on the left ho^de? but only patience
and impacie^t? If thou be a synnar / well / the thief was also a sinner / how
be it his pacyence obtained the glory of ryghtuousnesse and holiness.

So do thou like wise / for thou can not suffer but other for thy sins / or
for ryghtuousnesse / and both these suffrynges make the holy and blessed / if
thou love them. Wherefore thou have none excuse left. Finally as thou do
confess / that thou suffryst justly for thy sins / thou art ryghtuouse and
holy as the thief on the ryghthonde. The knoweleging of thy sin / because it
is truth does iustifye and make the holy. And eue^ then immediately (after
this knowelegyng of thy sin) thou do not suffer for thy sin / but for
thy truth and innocence For a ryghtuous man can not suffer / but for the
truth and innocently. Now art thou justified by the knoweleginge of thy sin
/ and suffering pacyently. Therefore (and that truly and worthyly) is thy
passion and suffering to de compared to the sufferyng of the saints even as
the knowelegyng of thy sins is to be compared unto theyrs. For there is but
one truth of all men the knouwelegyng of sin / sufferyng pacyently of all
euylles / and true co^munyon of holy men in all and by all things,

The seventh Chaptre of the seventh image which is the evil above us.
IN this last image we must lift up our heart and assence up in to the
mountain of Myrthe with the spouse. Here is Jesus Christ crucified the head of
all christen / the capteyn of all them that suffer / of whom many have written
many things And all men (as it is co^uenyent) have written all things. His
memory is commended unto the spouse / where as it is said. Put ^e as a sign
upon thine arm. The blood of this lamb marked on the post does put awey the
stryking angel. The spouse of him is commended / because her here is like the
purpure of a king. That is her meditacyon is read and of purpure color by
remembryng the passyo^ of Christ. This is the wodde that Moses was commanded
to put in to the waters of Marath (that is to say / the bitter passions) and
they were made sweet. There is nothing but this passion makes it swear / ye
death. As the spouse does say his lyppes are lylyes distillyng the chief and
pure Myrrh. What proporcyon is there between lylyes and lyppes? sith these are
read and they white. Truly it is spoken mystycally / because his words are
most white / and pure in the which is no blood bytternesse of envy or malice
/ but they are sweet and mylde / with the which (nevertheless) he does
distyll the most pure and chief myrrh / that is to say / persuadeth most
bitter death / which (even as the most pure and chief Mirrhe at one takes
awey all corrupcyo^ and stynking of the body) takes awey the corrupcyon and
stynking of sin. Of great power are these most swettest lyppes that are able
to make the most bitter death / sweet / pure / white and acceptable. But how
shall this be done? Truly while thou herest that Jesus Christ the son of god
has (by his most holy touching and passion) consecrate and hallowed all our
euylles / and suffrynges / ye the death it self most extremest and grettest of
all other / has blyssed the curse / glorified the slander made rich the
pouertye / so that death is compelled to be the gate of life / Curse / the
beginning of blyssyng.

And slander the father of glory / how can thou now be so hard and
unkind? that thou will not both love ye and also desire all passyo^s and
troubles / which are deped and purified in the most clean and holy flesh and
blood of Christ / and so made unto the holy / innocent / wholesome / blessed /
and glorified. For if he (by the touching of his clean flesh) has hallowed
al waters for baptesme ye al creatures. How much more by the touchi^ge of his
most pure flesh and blood had he sanctified al dethes / all passions / al
injuries all curses / al slanders / for the baptesme of the sprete or blood?
As he says of the same baptesme or passyo^ in the.xij. of Luke. I must be
baptized with a baptesme / and how I am payned till it be ended? Thou see
how he is payned how he pantith / how he thirsts to sanctifye and make loved
passion and death. For he sees that we are feared with passions / he sees that
death is feared and abhorred. Wherefore he (as a most meke sheperd / and most
faithful phisiseo^) going about to cure our evil / does have and is payned
until his dye that by his death he might make them acceptable and welcome to
us. So that the death of a Christen is to be counted lyke^ to the brazen serpent
of Moses which in all points had the facyon of a serpent / but it was clean
without life / without mouyng / without venom / without bytyng. So the
ryghtuous do apere to them that a soles to dye / how be it they live in
peace. We are like to things which dye / Nether is there any other face
outwardly of our death then of the death of other things. How be it the
things in deed are other wise. For to us death is deed. Likewise all our other
troubles and vexacyons are like the troubles of other things / but that is
only in the face outwardly. For in very deed our sufferynges at the beginning
of impassibilite / even as death is the beginning of life.

And this is it that Ihon speaks of in the viij. If a man keep my sayenges /
he shall never so death. How shall he not se death Truly for dying he begins
life. So that for the life which he sees he can not see death / here the night
as the day shall belyghtened / for there is much more clear light of the life
which we begin then there is of the life from which we be exyled by death.
And all these things are confyrmed and stablisshed to them which believe in
Christ / but it is contrary to them that believe not Therefore if thou kiss /
love / and embrace the cote of Christ vessels / water pottes / and such
other that Christ did touch and use / countyng them great and sweet relykes /
as though they were consecrated and hallowed by this thouchyng / why do thou
not much more love / embrace and kiss / the pains and euylles of this world
slander and death? which were not only hallowed by his touching / but also
cleansed and blissed in his pure blood / ye and embraced with the will of his
heart / his enfamming charity and mercy moving him thereunto / seeing that in
these are much greater merytes / rewards / and goodness / the^ in those
relykes for in these are obsteyned for the / the victory of death and heel / and
of all sins / and so is it not in the relyques. O that we might se / and
behold the heart of Christ / when that hangyng on the cross he was payned to
make death dead and despised how fervently / and swetely he took upon him
pains and death for us that were feerfull and did abhor pains and death how
gladly he began to drynk this cup to us that were dyseased / that we should
not fear after him to drink sith we do so that there chanced none evil to
him but only good by rising again.

No doubt chat chyef and pure myrrh (Crystes lyppes distillyng it and his
words commending it) should be most acceptable and sweet even as the smell of
lylses So writes Petre in the first pystle for as much as Christ has suffer
for us in flesh Arm your selves likewise with the same mind Paul also in
the.xij. to the Hebrews. Consider how that he endured such speaking against
him of sinners / lest ye should be weryed e^d saint in your minds. Therefore if
we have learned in the images before (which were byneth us and nere unto us) to
suffer euylles patiently / cruely in this last image which is set above us we
(being rauysshed in christ lift up and set higher them all euylles) ought not
only to suffer them / but also to love / desire and seek them. And the
ferther of that a man is from this mind and desire / the less he has of
Christ's passion. As they which use the signs and armure of Christ against
euylles and death / that they might nether suffer nether dye / which desires
are clean contrary to the cross and death of Christ wherefore it is necessary
that what euylles so ever we suffer be consumed and clean brought to naught in
this seventh image / so that it should not grieve us but rather delight us and
make us glad if this image perse and enter in to our her^s / or do remayn and
sure in our inward desire and mind.

This mothe have we spoken of the first table. Now follows the secunde.
TO the secunde table we shall also assygne seven images contrary to they me
that were made before. The first shall be of the inward goodness. The secunde
of the goodness to come. The third of the goodness passed, The fourth of the
goodness beneth us. The fyft of the goodness on the lift hand. The syxt of
the goodness on the right hand. The ses venthe of the goodness above us.

The first chapter of the first image which is the goodness with in us.
WHo is a bill to number the goodness which every man possesses in his own
person? first how great are the gifts of the body? as beutye streinght helt
/ q^cknesse / wit and besides these in the male the most perfai^ and noble
kind and nature / by the which he is mete to exercise and take upon him many
things private / comune and other excellent acts / which woman is nothing
mete nor apt to / whathe merueyle is it / if thou using these gifts (thorough
the favor of god) cenne twenty / or thyrty year with pleasure should suffer
and be payned in one of them for the space of te^ne days? whate shall we do
which have had many good hours / and will not be content to suffer one
evil? here may we se how we be endued by hepe with the goodly gifts of god.
And again with how few euylles many of us be oppressed or touched.

How be it god almyghtye (not thynking it sufficient to have done this much
for us) did also cast unto us richesse and plenteous abundaunce of all things
/ though not to all men yet truly to many / and to them specially that are
impotent and weak to suffer evil for (as I said before) to them he gives
more of the sprete / to whom he gave less worldly and bodyly goods that
there should be a certain equalite in all things and he the ryghtuouse judge of
al things. Nether do great richesse so much comfort a man as a merry and glad
sprete. Bisides this / to some he gives issue and children (which is a great
pleasure) power / imperye / honor a name / glory / favor / and such other
which if a man use a long season (ye though he use them but a small season)
they shall sone declare unto him whate he shall do in a little evil.

The gifts of the soul are more excele^c then all these as wit / connyng
judgment eloquence / wysdom / and these also (as he did the other) he deuideth
after an equalyte so that he has recompensed it in the other / by gyuing them
more quietness and gladness of mind.

In all these things the most liberal hond of god must be considered with
gyuyng thanks and our infirmite must be comforted that in this multitude and
gretnesse of goods we merueyl not / though some sowernesse be admyxt / for
unto voluptuous men / there is no meat acceptable which of his nature has
not other some sharp taste / or else his sauce prepared for him / so that
contynuall and only swetnesse is a thing intollerabill. Therefore it was well
said every pleasure by his perseueraunce makes a man full of it / and to
disdayn it. And again / it is said. Even pleasure her self is a pain: because
this life is to weke and impotent to suffer continually goodness without the
temperature of evil for the abu^dant copy of the goodness whereof spryngeth
this proverb. Their bones must be strong which shall suffer good days
which proverb I have often considered merueyling at the merueylous true
sentence of it / and how all the purposes and desires of men are clean
contrary unto it / which seek nothing but good days / ye when they have got
them they can worse bear them the^ the evil. For wha^te does god commend
unto us in those things / but that the cross should be merueylous / even in
the enemies of the cross: Insomoche that we ought to tempore and halowe all
things by it / even as we powdre flesh with salt that it do not putrify
and wareful of worms werfore the^ do not we receive with a glad heart / this
temperature sent of god / which if he did not sent / yet our life which is
not able to endure with this contynuall pleasure and goodness / would desire
it of his own will. Now we perceive how truly the wise man said of god he
that contynueth from the one end to the other strongly / and dysposeth all
things swetely / for if we consider these good things / it shall appear that
it is also true which is spoken of Moses in the.

xxxij. of Deuteronomyon / he bare him Upon his shulders / he led him about
and kept him as the balle of his eye with this saying we may stop their
mouths which unkindly chatter that there are mo euilles in this life them
good things for surely / we never lack goodness nor pleasures / full of
proufit and swetnesse: but we do much lack such people as should understand
it with the Prophet saying. The Earth is full with the mercy of god. And
again: the earth is full of his praise / and in the.ciij. psalm. The earth is
replenysshed with thy possession / thou have delyted me Lord in tese creatures
for this cause we sing daily in the mass: heuyn and earth are full of thy
glory / why so? for there are many good things for the which he should be
praised / but that is only of them which se this fullness and replenysshyng
for even as we said of the euylles in the first image / that every man's
evil was so great as his opinion / and knowelege was in it. Even so good
things though they come on us on every side and in a manner suppress us / yet
are they no gretter them they are extemed / for all that god made be verey good
/ how be it they be not known so of all men.

Of this image / Job gives us a fair and most proufitable example / which
(when all his goods were taken a way) said / if we have taken goodness of
the hond of the Lord why shall we not also suffer euylles? truly it was a
goodly sayng and a mighty comfort in temptacion / for he did not only suffer
but was also tempted by his wife to ympacyence / saying unto him will thou yet
persevere in this innocence? curse the Lord and dye / for it is manifest that
he is not god which so does forsake the / why them do thou trust in him and
not rather deny him / and curse him / and so to knowelege thy self mortal /
to whom after this life nothing is remaynyng. These and such other to every
man his own wife (which is sensualyte) does prompt and show in temptacyon /
for the sense sauoureth not that thing which perteyneth to god howebeit all
these things are bodyly goods / and comen to all men. But a Christen man
precelleth in other inward goods which are far better that is to say in the
faith of Christ / of the which it is spoken in the.xl. Psalm. All his glory
is of the kings daughter which is withyn in borderes of gold cumpassed about
with varyete. And as we have spoken of the evil of the first image / that
there can be seen no evil so great in a man / but there is a much worse in
him which he can not se. Even so the best of all the good things that be in a
Christen he him self can not se nor judge / for if he did perceive it he should
be then in heaven / because the kingdom of heaven (as says Christ) is withyn
us for he that has faith has the truth and word of god / and he that has the
word of god has god him self the maker of all things. If these goods were
reuelat unto the soul that he might feale the botom of them as they be in
verey deed / he would sone be dissolved from the body / for thabundaunce of
that swetnesse. wherefore all other goods art as it were a monysshyng of those
goods (that we have withyn us) which he would by theyme should be showed unto
us / because this life is not a byll to abide the glory of there if they were
showed forth. Therefore they are mercyfully hydden of god until they are
increased to their perfect state / even as loving fathers do give unto their
children sometime little gifts to play wythall / whereby they may entyce the
myndys of their children to trust for gretter things.

How be it sometime they show them self and come forth when that the
conscience (rejoicing / does committee him self holly unto got / speaks gladly
of him / hereth his word swetely and devoutly / is ready and glad to serve him
/ to do good works / to suffer euylles / and such other / which all are
tokens of an infinite and inco^parabill goodness lying with in / which
sends out the^se sweet drops by a little at ones though sumtyme it, chance
that it be ferther reuelate to souls which fall to contemplacyon / in so
much that they are made dronke^ with it / and can not tell where they are. As
S. Augustine and his mother do confess of them selves / and many other.

The secunde Chapter of the secunde image which is / the goodness to come /
or before him.
THey that are not Christen can take but small comfort of the goodness to come
/ because to them all things are uncertain for this affect which is called
hope (by the which we are commanded after man's confortyng to trust ever for
the best / bithe which we take great matters in hand trustyng to bring them
to our purposse (does of ten times) ye and in a manner alweyes / deceive us. As
Christ does teach in the.xij. of luke of the rich man which said to his
soul. I will distroy my barnes and bylde gretter / and theryn will I gadre all
my fruits and all my goods / and will say unto my soul: Soul thou have
much goods leyd up in store for many years / take thine ease / eat / drink
/ and be merry. But god said unto him: thou sole this night will they fetch
awey thy foul again from the / then whose shall tho is things be which thou
have provided? So is it with him that gathers richesse and is not rich in
god.

Nether yet has god left the sons of men so / but does confort them by a
hole suer and perfait hope / that they shall over come their euilles and
obtain goodness And though they be uncertain where goodness ^t is that shall
come / yet they hope still without doubt / by the which hope they are
sustained / lest (by falling ynto desperatyon) they should not be able to
suffer their present evil / and so to do worse wherefore this affect of hope
which is in temporal things is given the of god / not taht he would have the
stykke therein / but to proceed unto the hole suer / and parfayt hope which is
only unto him. And for this cause god is lu^g sufferyng that be may bring us
to repentance / As paul says in the ij. to the Romans. Nether will he
suffer that all men be deceived in this imperfect and deceytful hope whithe is
in worldly matters / but that they return and take the parfait and unfeigned
hope which is in him.

There are bysides these goods to the Christian.ij. great goods which they
shall suerly have but not without death and sufferyng for they have also the
common hope that we spoke of / concerning the fynys^hing of their present evil
and increasing of the contrary good / although they do not so gretely regard
that / as they do in the increasyng of their own proper good / which is the
truth in Christ in the which they do proceed from day to day / for the wiche
they do both live and hope. But bysides these as I said / there is.ij. chyef
which shall come in death. The first is that in death is fynysshed all the
tragedy of the euylles in this life / as it is written Precious is in the sight
of god / the death of his saints. And again in peace I shall both sleep and
rest. And a ryghtuous man if he be subdewed of death he shall be in colenesse.
And contrary to theyme that are wyked / death is the beginning of evil. As it
is said the death of sinners is worst / and euylles shall take an evil man in
his death. So Lazarus shall be comforted which has received here his euylles /
where as the gloton shall be punysshed because he has received here his goods.

So it feloweth that a christen whether he die or live is ever in better taking
/ such a blissed thing is it to be a christen and to believe in christ wherefore
as Paul says To live it is Christ to me / and to dye it is advantage / and
in the.xiiij. to the Roma. he that lives he lives to god / and he that dies
he dies to god / whether we live therefore or dye we are the lords.

This surenesse has christ obtained for us because that he died and rose again
/ that he should be lord both of quykke and deed which was a bill to make us
sure^ both in life and death as the prophet says in the, xxij. psalm: If I
walk in the mids of the shadow of death I will not fear euilles because
thou art with me. And if that this adauau^tage of death do but little move us /
it is a sign that our faith in Christ is verey weke with us / for he that
does not well exteme the price and value of a good death / or else that death is
good / he does not yet believe but is over much letre by the old adam / and
the wisdom of the fllesshe yet reynyng in him / we must therefore labor that
we may be promoted to know and love this benefyte of death. It is a great
thing that death (which is to other the greatest evil) is made to us the
greatest advantage / and except that Christ had gotten that for us / whate great
thing had he done by gyuyng him self for us.

Truly it was a godly work that he did therefore it was no merueyle to him to
make the evil of death most proufitable for us Therefore death is now deed to
faithful men / and has nothing to be feared for / but his visar and outward
face.

And is even like to a serpent which is killed for he has the ferefull shape
that he had before / how be it in verey deed there is nothing left but the
figure / the evil is deed / and can do no more harm. And as in the.xxi. of
Numery God commanded the brazen serpent to be lift up by whose sight the
quykke serpents did perisshe. Likewise our death by the faithful beholding of
the death of Christ does perisshe and does not now appear but a certain figure
of death. So the mercy of God has figured all things to us that are weke /
that he has destroyed the power of death / and (because it can not be utterly
put awey) has made it but a verey figure / for the which cause it rather
called sleep inscripture then death.

The secunde goodness of death is that it does not only fynisshe the euilles
and pains of this life / but also (which is letter) it makes an end of all
vice and sin the which to them that be good faithful makes death much more
to be desired then these present goods whereof we have spoken / for the euilles
of the soul (which are sins) are without comparison worse the^ the euylles
of the body. These only sins (if we did sauoure theyme) would make death
verey acceptable and loved unto us / which thing if they do not / it is a
sign that we do not well perceive nor hate the euylles of our soul. Therefore
since this life is full of perils / and that sin does bes^ge us on every
side / and since we can not live without sin / death is best and most expedient
which loses us from the seperilles / and cutteth sin clean awey from us
therefore in the praise of a ryghtuouse man it is spoken / in the.iiij. of
Sapience. He that pleased god is made beloved / and he (living among sinners)
is translated and rauysshed / that malice should not change his vndersto^ding
/ nether that fayning should deceive his soul for the bewitching of tryfeling
does darken goodness / and the unstableness of concupisce^ce does ouerwhelme
the wit with out malice (O how true these words are and daily ^ene) it is
fone roted and hard to be dystroyed. But his soul pleased god and for that he
hasted to bring him out from the mids of iniquite. Even so (thorough the
mercy of god) death which was to man the pain of sin made to the christen
the end of sin and the beginning of life and ryghtuousnesse wherefore it is
necessary that he which louith life and ryghtuousnesse should not abhor death
(which is the minyster and gate of them both) but rather to love it / or
else he can never come to life and ryghtuousnesse / and he that can not love
it / let him pray god that he may. For therefore are we taught to say / thy will
be fulfilled / because we (which fearing death do rather favor and love sin
then justice) of our power be not abyl to fulfill it. And that god did ordeyn
death to be the destruccyon of sin / it maybe gathered of this / that after
sin he put death upon Adam by and by / ye before he cast him for the of
Paradise / to thinte^t to show us that death should work none evil but all
goodness toward us sith it was put on him (as a penance and satisfaction) in
paradise.

Truth it is that by the envy of the devil death entered into all the world /
but in this was declared the high and godly goodness toward us / that it was
ordyned even at his first beginning / not to hurt us but to be the pain and
destruction of sin to our great proufit. This was signyfyed when be had
told Adam before in the precept / that what hour so ever he did taste of that
fruit he should dye / yet after the tra^gression he did moderate the extremyte
and rygoure of the precept / nether did he speak one syllable of death / but
said only. Thou art earth / and shall return into earth / until thou come
again into the lond^ out of the which thou art taken. And (as though he had
hated death) would not vouthesaus ones to name it / according to the Prophet
layng / for there is wrath in his indignacyon and life in his will. And seemed
so to speak / that except death had been necessary to the destruction of sin he
would never have put it upon man / no / nether yet have named it. Even so
against sin which brought forth death / the prouysyon of God did so arm death
/ that here thou may se fulfilled the saying of the Poet. The maker of death
/ did perisshe by his own work / and sin was distroyed and killed by his
own proper fruit (that is to say death) which he begat he himself / even as a
viper by her own you fruit.

This is a goodly sight to se how death is distroyed / not by an others work /
but by his own. As Goliath had his he destroy ^en of wih his own sword For
Goliath was the figure of sin / a terrybill gyaunt to all men / except to
little David (that is to say to Christ) which alone did over throw him / and
cutting of his head with his own sword said: there can not be ater sword
then Golyath has him self. If then we do remember these joys of the virtue
of Christ and the gifts of his grace / whate shall a little evil vex us? sith
in that great evil to come we se so great profits and commodytees.

The third chapter of the.iij. image which is the good that is passed or
behind us
THe co^syderacyon of this good which is passed may sone be gathered by his
contrary image which we spoke last of how be it we will help (in this also)
him that desires to look on it. Saint Austyne in this thing is a great doar /
in his co^fessyo^s / where he does well recite the benefits of god toward him
/ from the womb of his mother. That does also the excellent psalm. Lord thou
have proved me / where among all other he merueyling at the providence of god
says Thou have understood my though^es a far of my path / and my down
lyinges thou have serched / as though he would say / whate so ever thing I have
thouht / and what so ever I have wrought / or how much so ever I should
obtain and possess / now I perceive that it is not done by my wit and
polecye / but that they were ordyned by thy prouisyon long before this time /
finally. Thou have seen before all my ways / and there is no word in my
tongue. Wherein then? in thy power.

This we learn by our own experience / for if we remember our life which is
passed / shall we not merueyle / that we have thought / wylled / done and said
such things as we could not se before? how should we have brought theyme to
pass / if we had been left to our own will and power? And now first we
perceive and se that his care was so ready with us / and his provision so
co^staunt upon us / that we could nether speak / will / nor think / but that
which he had given us. As it is spoken Sapience.vij. for in his hond are both
we and our works. And Paul / which works all things in all men / why
then are not we (so insensyble and hard ^arted) a shamed? which (thaugh by
our own experience) do ^e how careful the lord has been for us unto this
day / and has given us all goods: and yet cannot find in our hertes to give
unto him the same charged over us in a little tryfill / but order our self so
folishely as though he had forsaken us / or else might forsake us / does not
the Psalm say on this manner? I truly am ^edy and poor / the lord takes
thought for me. Saint Austyne says. Let him take charge on the which made
the / which provided for the / before thou were. How can it be that he shall
not provide for the which art a man / sith he provided for the to be a man.
But thou will say we have the rule of our self as well as god / we grant
unto him that he made us (and that scarcely) but we have in our power the
charge of our self / as who says: he made us / and and by and by went his
wey / leuyng us in our own power to rule and order our self. And if that
our wisdom and prouysyon do let us / that we can not perceive this workyng of
God / while that par adventure many things do chance after our purpose / yet
ones turn thine yie and look upon the Psalm which says: My bone is not hyd
from the / which thou made in secret / that is to say. Thou dydest se and
facyo^ my bones in my mothers belly when I was not / when my mother did not yet
know whate was made in her / and my substance in the neder parts of the earth
/ that is to say / the figure and facyon of my body in the lowest bowelles of
my mother was not hid from the / for thou did make it. Whate means he by
these words? but to show us by this great example / whate care god has ever
taken for us? who can glory that he wrought with god and holy to make him
self in his mothers belly? Who gave the mother charge to give us myske / to
nourisshe us / to love us / and to exercise all motherly dewetyes to us when
that we did not yet feale our life? Of this should we know nothing except we
had seen it done in other / and so thereby believe that we were even so ordered,
Nether should we have any memory of them that they were done to us / no more
them if they had been done to them that sleep / ye or be deed / and rather not
yet borne / for asmoche as concernyth our knowelege and memory.

Here we se that without our help the goodly mercyes and co^fortes be
mynistred unto us. Do we yet doubt and dispeyre to commit the cure and custody
of us unto hi^. If this experience do not move and instruct man / I wot not
whate will move him / for we do se this comynly in all young children set before
our yies / so that so many examples may make us a shamed of our folysshenesse
and hardynesse. If we should think that the lyghtest good and evil should
chance unto us without the singular prouisyon of God. Saint Petre says. Cast
all your care to him for he cares for you And the Psalm, Cast all thy care
upon the Lord and he shall nourisshe the. And S. Augustyne in his co^fessyons
to his soul / why sto^dest thou upon thy self and do not sto^de? Cast thy
self to him / he will not pluck awey his hond that thou may fall. And ageyn
S. Petre says. Let them that suffer according to the will of God / commytte
their souls to him with well doing / as unto a faithful creator.

O if any man did know his god after this manner / how suer / how quiet /
how merry should he live? be truly should have God / knowing surely that
whatsoever thing do come or chance unto him / it is by the dysposicyon and
ordinance of his sweet will. The sentence of Petre is sure and stable / he
caryth for you / whate can we hear swetter the^ these words? Therefore cast
all your care (he says) to him / which if we do not (but will our self
care for our self) whate do we else then goo about to let the prouisyon of
God? and to make also our life sad / labourouse / bered with many fears /
cares / and troubles and that in vain / for we do nothing profit here with /
but as the Ecclesiastique says. This is the vanyte of all vanytyes / and
veryng of the sprete / For through his hole book he speakith in experyence of
this thing which he has much labored and attempted for him self. How be
it in all his labor he found nothing but pain vanyte and vexacyon of the
sprete / so that he concludes that is the gift of God if a man eat / drink
/ and be merry with his wife / that is to say if he live without care and
thought / and so be takes him self to god which caryth for all. Wherefore we
ought to take none other care upon us but this that we take no thought for our
self but committee and leave all our care and thought to God. All there things
(as I said) a man may sone gather by the contrary image / and by remembrance
of his life passed.

The fourth Chaptre of the.iiij. image which is the good beneth us.
Hitherto we have co^sydered the goods which are in us and ours / here after
let us exteme these goods which are set, without us and in other. And first
them which are byneth us / that is to say dead and dampened. Paradue^ture ye
would merueyle whate good things could be found in them which are dead and
dampened / how be it the power of the godly goodness is so great in every
place that he she with us goodness and his glory in the most euilles that be.
Let us compare them unto our self then so we our inestimable and infinite
profits / and co^modytyes as we may also easily perceive by the contrary image
of euylles. For the moo euylles of death and hell we see in them the moo
profit we perceive in us. And the more vehement and extreme their euylles be
the more we count our advantage which are not lightly to be dispysed and set
at naught for they commend to us the high and bounteous mercy of God. And the
ieoperdye is / lest we unking (setting little by it) be found worthy to be
dampened with them or worse to be tormented.

Therefore the more we se them sorrow and lament / the more we ought to rejoice
in our self of the goodness of God / according to the sayng of Esaias. Behold
my servants shall eat and you shall be hungry. Behold my servants shall
drink / and you shall be tristye. Behold my servants shall be merry and you
shall be confounded. Behold my servants shall praise for the reioysyng of
their hearts / and you shall cry for the sorrow of your hearts: and you
shall howl for the contricion of your sprete / and you shall put down your
name in an other to my elect and so forth / finally as I said. The examples of
them that do evil dye and are dampened / as saint Gregory does show in a
dialoge / do profyt us to be a monysshement / and an instructyon that he may be
happy whom other men's perils do make wise.

Truly this good (because it is comenly known) does but litel move us /
although it ought to be numbered among the chyef / and is of great reputacyon
to them that have good judgment / sith that a great part of holy scripture
where he speaks of the wrath iugementes / and thretenynges of God perteyne to
this place. These wholesome instruccyo^s / the examples of wretched persons do
profitably confirm in us / which them chyefly be of power and efficacyte / if
we put on us the mind of them which suffer them / and co^uict our self in
their stead and place / them shall they flurre us up and move us to the praise
of the goodness of God / which has kept us from them. Let us also co^ferre
them to God him self / so that we may co^fyder the justice of god in them.
Though this he hard / yet let us go about it / for sith that god is a just
judge / it is expedyent that his justice be loved and praised. And so then ought
we to rejoice in God / when he distroyeth evil men both in body and soul /
for in all these things his high and ineffable justice she with him self.
Therefore verey hell also is full of god and high goodness / no less then
heaven / for the justice of god is god him self / and god is the high
goodness. Wherefore as his mercy / even so his justice and judgment / most
hyghly are to beloved / praised and preached.

This meant David saying the ryghtuous man shall be glad when he shall se
auengement / he shall wasshe his hondes in the blood of a sinner. For this
cause did the Lord forbid Samuel that he should no more lament Saul / saying
how long mornest thou for Saul / sith I have cast him down that he should not
reygne over Israel?

As though he should say / does my will so displease the / that thou will
prefer a man's with before mine? finally. This is the voice of praise and
gladness thorough all the Psalter / that the Lord is judge of widows / and
father of fatherles children / that he shall avenge the pore / that his enemies
shall be confounded the wikked shall be distroyed / and many such other. And
if that any man thorough folisshe mercy will have pytye on that wyked bloody
nacyo^ and hope of infidels which killed the ryghtuous / ye the son of god /
by and by / he shall be found to rejoice in their iniquite / and to allow and
favor those things which they did / and so to be verey worthy to perisshe
with them whose offenses he would not have punysshed. Let us therefore hear
this tex^. Thou ^oest love them that bate the and hate them that love the.
A^ Ioas said to David when he did over much lament his wyked son an homycyde
Absalon.ij. of the kings.xix. wherefore in this image we must rejoice in the
pitye of holy men and in the justice of God which most ryghtuously does
punisshe the pursuer and of pytye / to deliver his chosen people from them.
And so thou seyst that there appears not a little but a great deal of good in
them that are deed and dampened for in them is aduenged all the iniuryes of
the holy men / and thine also if thou be ryghtuouse among theyrs. Whate
merueyle is it then if (by thy present evil) he punysshe thine enemy / that
is to say the sin of thy body? Ye thou must rejoice in this act of the most
noble justice of God / which (though thou desire him not) does kill and
distroye thy mischeuous enemy / that is to say / thy sin in thy self /
which if thou favor thou shall be found a friend of sin and an enemy of
justice which works in the. So that thou may fere lest this be also spoken
to the. Thou do love them that hate the / and hate them that love the.
Therefore eue^ as thou must rejoice with all thy heart in the justice which is
feerse and cruel against thy sin. Even so must thou be glad when it pursues
and punyssheth sinners which are the enemies of god and all good men. Thou
see no we that principal goods appear sumtyme in extreme euylles / not for
the euylles but for the great goodness of justice / which does avenge us,

The.v. chapter of the fyft image which is the evil on the lift hond.
SOme adversaries we have here in this life (bisides them of whom we have
spoken in the Chaptre next before which are dampened and made like unto fyndes)
whom we must consider with an other mind / and we shall perceive.ij. profits
that come of them. First that they habunde with temporal goods / in so much
that the Prophets where almost moved unto envy by their goods / as in the
Psalm.lxxvij. My fete be almost moved / my steps be disparsed / for I have
favored the wyked / seeing the peace and prosperity of sinners. And after /
Behold the verey sinners have obtained the abundauntry chesse in the world.
And in Hieremye.xii. Truly lord thou art just / if I should dispute with the /
how be it. I will speak ryghtuous things unto the / why does the wey of wyked
men prosper? for they are all well / which trangresse thy commandments and
live wykydly. Why does he pour so many benefytes upon them for nothing and
leseth them? but to comfort us / and show how good he is to them that are
ryghteuous / as the psalm says: he that is so good to evil how much more
shall he be good to the good? reserved that he punissheth the evil with no
vexacyon / and tempts the good with many troubles / that they may knowelege
him to be good to them / not only in these present goods / but also in the
secret goods which be to come / and may say with the same Psalm it is good
for me to cleue to the lord / and to put my hope in god: As though he should
say / be it / that I suffer some things which I se they suffer not / yet I
trust that god is much better unto me them unto them and so these visible
euylles are an argument of invisible goodness / that we should trust for goods
invisible / and despise the euylles that we suffer: Even as Christ in the
gospel / bids us to behold the fowls of the air / and the ly yes of the
field saying / if god so clothe the grass which is to day in the fylde and to
morrow shall be cast into the furnace shall he not much more do the same unto
you / o ye of little faith / wherefore by conferring the goods with which the
evil abound / unto the euylles which we suffer our faith is exercysed / and
our comfort (which only is holy) is stablisshed in god so that it is
necessary that all things work for the best unto them that love god. The
secunde profit (much more merueylous) is that all their euilles are good unto
us / god so prouydeht for us / for although their offenses be evil occasyons
unto the weak / yet to them that be strong they be an exercise of virtue / an
occasyon of resisting of sin / and a great merit.

Blissed is that man which suffers temptacyon / for when he is proved / he
shall receive a crown of life / where is a greater temptacion then the
multitude of myschevous examples? finally for this cause the world is called
one of the enemies of the elect people of god because that says his
entisementes / and wicked works / he ^^^reth us up provoke us / and entysith
us from the wey of god into his wey / As it is written in Genesisvi. The children
of god did se the daughters of me^ that they were fair / and they were made
carnal. And in the.^xv. of Numeri / The children of Israel did fall with the
daughters of the Moabites / so that it is wholesome that we ever be suppressed by
some incommodyte / lest that we (as they that are weke) offended by the evil
occasions of the world should fall and sin. So lot is commended of S. Petre
in the secunde of his secund epistell / because that he suffered much evil by
the w^ked examples of the sodomytes / and nevertheless continued in his
ryghtuousnesse. Necessary it is therefore that evil occasyons be given / which
should be the occasysion that we should resist sin and have victory / how be
it woe be unto the world because of evil occasions. Dyth then in the
transgressions of other god procures for us so great goods: how much more
ought we to believe / with all our heart that he will turn over own offen^^s to
our profits / though the with and flesh judge otherwise. Nether any less does
the would profit us by his other evil which is called aduersite / for them
that he cannot, devour by his entisementes / nor incorporate to him by evil
occasions / he labors to drive them from him by troubles and passions and
to vex and inquyet them by pains and punysshementes / ever entending other
deceytes thorough the example of sin / or else to auert men's myndee by
pains and turme^tes. This is the monstre thy mer a whose head is flateryng /
and like a virgyns this belie deuouryng and like a lions and his tail full of
death and like a serpents / for the end of the world / both of pleasure and
tyranny is venom and death everlasting.

Therefore as in the sins of the world god has made us to find profytes.

Even so (that his persequucyons should not be ydell and in vain) they are
ordained to us for the increasing of our goods in so much / that in that
they hurt us / they are compelled to profit us. As saint Augustyne does say /
concerning the little children which were killed of Herod / he conde never
have done so great profit and good by his benefytes / as he did by his hate
and envy. And saint Agatha went reioysyng to the prison as though she had gone
to a dinner saying on this manner without thou make my body to be well handeled
of thy turmentours / my soul can not with victory enter into Paradyse, as the
corn without he be thrust out of his husk / and be strongly beten in the
barn flower shall not belayd up in the garner. But whate need us to speak so
much of this / sith the hole scripture / all the wrytinges and sayings of the
fathers / and all the deades and acts of the holy men are consenting unto this
that those things which are most noysom are most profitable to them that
believe / so that they be well suffered. As S. Petre says / who is he that
will harm you if ye follow that which is good. And the Psalm.lxxxviij. his
enemy shall nothing prevayle against him. And the son of iniquyte shall have
no power to hurt him / how shall he not hurt him sith that many times he
kylleth him. Cruely for in hurtyng him he does him most profit. Therefore wese
that we dwell in the mids of goodness on every side / if we be wise / and
also in the mids of euylles. So are all things tempered merueylously by the
high providence of the goodness of god.

The syxt Chapter of the syxte image which is the good on the right hand.
THis is the congregation of holy me^ the new creature of god / our friends
and brothers in whom we se nothing but good nothing but comfort / if we
behold them with a spyrytuall yie for unto the carnal yie many times it
appears all otherwise / as we have declared in the contrary image of euylles.
And yet these goods which we seyn them with our carnal yie are not to be
dispysed. But in these we may perceive that we are comforted of god / for the
Psalm durst not presume to condemn all them which possessed richesse in
this world / saying / If I did say thus. Behold I have reproved the generation
of thy children. If I would have send that all which are rich / hole and
honored be evil. I should have condemned thy holy men for many of them are
^o Chappostell also teaches tymothe that he command the rich men of this
world) that they be not proud / not to forbid theyme to be rich. The
scripture also does testify that Abraham Isaac and Jacob were rich. And
Danyell with his companions / were also honored in Babylon. Besides this many
kings of Iurye were rich The Psalm therefore consyderyng them says / If I
did say thus: I have reproved the nacyon of thy children. for (I say) god has
given to his elect the abundaunce of these richesse to comfort them / and
other with all how beit these are not their special goods / but they are a
sign and a shadow of the true goods which are feith / hope / cheryte / and
other graces and gifts which all are comune by charity.

This is the communyon of holy men in the which we rejoice.

And who will not here rejoice / ye though he be i^ great sorrows which does
believe (as it is in deed) that all the goods of holy men are his goods and
that his evil is also theyrs. This image is most sweet and pleasant / which
Chappostel to the Galathians.vi. does descrybe / saying bear ye one an others
burden and so fulfill ye the law of Christ.

Is it not good for us to be here where if one membre do suffer (as it is said
unto the Corinthians) all suffer with him. If one member be had in honor /
all members be glad also Therefore / while I suffer / I suffer not alone / for
Christ and all Christen suffer with me. As he says him self / he that
touches you touches the ball of mine yie. Thus / do other here my burden /
and there virtue is mine. The faith of the congregacyon socoureth my
fearfulness. The chastyte of other heals the temptacyon of my lust. The
fasting of other is mine advantage.

The prayers of other takes thought for me. And to be short / so all the
me^bres help one an other that the most honest parts do cover / keep and
honor the less honest.

As it is well discrybed unto the Corinthia^s.xij. And a swell I may delight in
the goods of other as in mine own / and then truly they are mine if I be
glad and rejoice in them. I am foul and fylthy / but they whom I love and
in whom I rejoice are fair and beutifull. By the which love I do not only
make their goods mine / but also them selves / wherefore under their glory
mine ignominy shall easyli^e honored their richesse shall fulfill my
pouertye. Their good deeds shall heal my sins / whate man can now dispeyre
in sin? who will not rejoice in pains? which now does not bear his sins
or at the lest if he bear them / he bears theyme not alone / but is help
with so many children of god / ye with Christ him self Such a thing is the
communyon of holy men / and the Church of Christ. If any man do not believe
that this is true he is an infidele / and has denied Christ and his church:
for though this be not fealt / yet it is so done / ye who is he that fealeth
not this who is in the cause that thou disperyest not that thou art not
ympacyent? Thy virtue na^ truly / but the feloushyppe of holy me^ or else
thou were not abyll to bear the lest sin that is / nor yet abide one word of
man against the / so nygh is Christ and the church unto the.

This is it that we say / I believe in the holy ghost / the holy and pure
church whate is it to believe the holy church / but the communyon of holy?
wheryn do the holy men common? Truly in good and evil and all things. As the
sacrament of Christ's body does figure it in bread and wine whereof Thappostle
spekith saying / we are one bread and one body / who offends any little part
of the body / and hurts not the hole? whate suffers the ferthest part of
the foot that the hole bodi suffers not? wate benefyte is done to the feate
in the which all the body reioyseth not. But we are one body: therefore whate
so ever another sufferyth I suffer and whate so ever benefyte is done to an
other / it is done to me. Even so Christ says that whate so ever is done to
one of his left is done unto him whate man taking a little peace of bread of
the altar will not sey that he has taken bread / or dyspysing any little part
of hy shall not be named to despise bread.

Wherefore if we sorrow / if we suffer / if we dye / let our yie look
hytherward / and let us believe strongly and besure / that not we or at the lest
not we alone: But christ also and his church does sorrow / suffer / and dye
with us. So good is Christ unto us that he would not the way of our death
should be solytarye which every man does abhor: But (all the church beryng
us company) we enter the wey of passions and death and the church does mare
strongly suffer it then we do / so that we may well apply unto us the words
of Helyseus which he spoke to his forefull servant saying: fear not / there
are more with us then with theyme. And when Helyseus had prayed he said Lord
open this childs yies that he may se. And the Lord opened his yies / and he
did se / and beheld a mountaynefull of horses and charettes of fire about
Helyseus we lack now nothing but to pray / that our yies may be opened and
that we may fethe church round about us with the yies of the faith. Then have
we noting to fear. As the Psalm says: Mountains are about it and the Lord
in the compass of his people from this time present and perpetually / Amen.

The seventh Chapeter of the seventh image which is the good above us.
I Speak nothing of the everlasting and heuynly goods which the blyssed have
in the clear sight of god. Or at the lest if I touch theyme / it is in the
faith / by the means whereof we may only obtain theyme. But this seventh
image is Jesus Christ king of glory / rising from death euin as he was the
seventh image of euylles / sufferyng / dying / and being buried / here may we
se the high and chief joy of our heart / and goods parmanent and stable Here
is none euylles at all / for Crist ones raised from death / dies no more / death
has no more power over him.

This is the chemney of charity / the fire of god in Syon. As Esaias as says
christ is borne for us / and not that only but also given unto us. Wherefore his
resurrection is mine / ye and all things which he wrought thorough his
resurreccion. And as tappostell unto the Romans.viij. most copyously gloryeth
sayng how shall he not with him give us all things? whate wrought he by his
ressurection truly he dystroyed sin and raised ryghtuousnesse confirmed death
and restored life / overcame hell and brought everlasting glory. These things
are inestimable and such as man's understanding scarce can believe to be given
unto him: No more then Jacob which (amassed eue^ as though he had wakened out
of a great sleep when he herd sey that his son Joseph did reygne i^ Egypt)
could not believe it until they rehersyng all did show him the waynes that
were sent from Joseph. So truly it had been very hard to believe that such
great benefytes had been by Jesus Christ given to us which were unworthy
except that by many words / by many ways and apperinges he had showed him
self to his dyscyples.

So that at the last by great use and experyence of his showing and teaching
(as Jacob was by the waynes we be taught so to believe. Truly Christ is to us a
true and notable sign / and wayne which is made of god / our wisdom /
ryghtuousnesse / sanctifyeng and redemption. As thappostell says I am a s^nne
/ but I am carried in his righteousness which is given unto me. I am unclean
but his holiness is my sanctifieng / wheryn I am swetely carried / I am
folisshe / but his wisdom caryeth me / I am sinful and dampnabyll but his
innocence is my redemption his goodness is a sure charyot that caryeth me out
of perdycion. Thus may every Christen / this sto^ding that he have feith) bost
of all the goodness and merits of Christ: nether needs he more nor less to
rejoice in them then if he had done them him self / and even so are they his
own. So that now he may joyfully abide the judgment of god which eyles were
intolerable. Such a noble thing is faith. Such profits is getteh for us.
Such glorious children of god it makes us. Nether can we be chylder except we
enheryte our fathers goods.

Let then every Christian sey with sure trust and confydence: death / where is thy
victory death / where is thy stynge / that is to sey sin? for the styng of
death is sin / and the power of sin is the law. Thanks be to god which
has given us the victory / thorough Jesus Christ our Lord / finally.

The law makes us sinners / And sin makes us subject unto the sentence of
death who has overcome these.ij. our justice? our life? nay truly / but
Jesus Christ ryssing from death ^ondempnyng sin and death gyuyng us his rustyce
/ and distributing to us his merytes / which also by puttyng his bond upon us
has healed us and given us power to fulfill the law to overcome death / to
exile sin and to both children of god / to whom be honor / praise / and
thanks with out measure / and end. Ammen.

This is the last image in the which now we (not only lylt up above our
euylles / but also above our goods lately also sittyng in the euylles and
perils to us purchased by the sin and offense of an other / and increased
by our own) now fit and rest us in the goods gotten by the righteousness
of an other that is of Jesus christ only for us crucfied we are justified in
his justice and even as he is just and ryghtuous / even so are we that are
alyed knytte / and clean unto him by faith This is he that has given him self
hole to us. This is he that pleases god. This is the most chyef pressed / the
true bishop / the good advocate our only mediator / that continually (never
ceassing) in the presence of his father prays for us. And look how
impossible it is that he in his justice should not please Even so impossible it
is that we by faith whereby we cleue unto his ryghtuousnesse should not please.
And by these means a Christen is almighty / Lord of all things / and clean
without all sin. And if it chance that he fall ynto sin? yet is it
necessary that they hurt not / but are forgeuen for the justice of Christ
which is not a bill to be overcome which dries up and puts awey all sin
/ on the which also our faith does lene surely beleuyng that Christ is such
a one unto us as we have spoken of him / and much better then we are able to
declare / for he that believes not this / knowith not Christ nether
understands whate Christ proufiteth / neither whate he is good for.

Wherefore even this one image if there were none other / may increase such
comfort in us if we behold it with a good and dylyge^t heart that we shall
nothing be sorry in our troubles but rather (as though we felt them not)
rejoice and be glade in Christ that we have tribulacions with the which
rejoicing instruct us christ hi^ self our Lords god which is blissed for
ever. And

A devout fruitful and godly remembrance of the passion of our savior
Christ Jesus.
THere are certain which when they exercise the^ selves in the meditacion or
remembrance of the passion which Christ suffered for man kind / do nothing
else but were wode and furious agenst the blind Iues and Judas their gyde
through whom he was betrayed (as an innocent lamb) into their bloudye and
cruel hands (Even as it is the comen manner of them which are wont to lament
and bewail the myse^ye of their friends to accuse and cry out on those
persons which do the dead) but they nothing consider them which are the
chief causes of his better deeth and passion. So that surely this may better
be called a remembrance of the Iues wyckednes then of Christ's passion.

There are other that have gathered to gether diverse co^modityes which spring
through the diligent beholdynge of this passion / whereof is the saying of
Albert in every ma^s mouth: that it is better to remember the passion of
Christ once in our life all though it be but slenderlye / the to fast every
day a hole year to gether: or to read over the hole psalter of David / how he
it for all their politic means and studyouse ymaginacyo^s they could never
attain the very use and profit of the passyo^ of Christ. Nether sought they
any thing theryn but their own private wealth / For some carried about the^
images / painted papers / carved tables / crosses and soch other trifles / ye
and some fell to soch mad ignorance that they thought them selves through
soch beggerrye to be safe from fire / water and all other perylous ieoperdyes.
As though the cross of Christ should deliver them from soch outward troubles
and not rather the contrary.

These do pytuouslye sorrow and morn for Christ and compain that he was
innocent and gylties put to deeth / even like as the women of Jerusalem whom
Christ him self did reprehende aduertisynge them that they should lament them
selves and their own children. Nether is it any meruell for the preachers
them selves are sick of the same disease / which for the most part when they
increase this matter / lepe out of the fruitful and holesom storye in to these
their comen places: how Jesus took his leave of his disciples I Bethania. And
with what dolorous syghes his mother Marye pityed him and soth other things /
on se these that table at length and discant at these plesures rather to the
wereynge then edefyenge of the audience / unto this sort may we also adnumbre
them which have defyned and enstructe other what excellent commodytyes are in
the mass / in so much that the rude and ignoraunte people persuaded the^
selves that it was sufficient if they had herd a mass / and that they should
have good luck what so ever mischefe they went a boute. And there are some
which run so far hedlinge that they affirm stoutelye that the mass which
they call a sacrifice is accept of god for the work it self and not for his
sake that does the mass They consider not that god looks first on the person
that works / and then after on the work as thou have a goodlye ensample
Give, the fourth of Abell and Cayn. They consider not that an evil tree can not
bring forth good fruit. Matthew. xil. And that on a bromble men can gether no
fygges. Matthew. vij. They consider not that the mass was institute of Christ to
make us more holy through the devour remembrance of his passion with a pure
faith / and not for any other worthynesse that it has in it self. How be it
though we should grant them that the mass in it self were as good and holy
as their covetousness and belyes have feigned it / yet truly can it nothing
profit us except we use it for the same purposse that Christ did institute
it. For what does it profitte us that meat and drink are good and holesom if
we abuse them corruptinge our nature / ye or what does it avail us that god
is God / that is to say almightye / most merciful / good right will and
alone sufficient if we abuse his goodness and believe not in him? It is therefore
to be feared lest if thou be ignoraunte in the true use of the mass that the
moo thou hear the more thou offendest god abusinge his institucyon and
ordinance.

But these are the very right beholders of Christ's passion / which consider
and marcke in his passion their own sins and enormityes which were the cause
and ground of his passion and deeth / for they are feared / and their
consciences tremble as soon as they remember the passyo^ which fear and
trembling ryeseth of this that they may se in the passion the vehement wrath
and ryghtuous punyshement of god the father against sinners which would not for all the abundaunt favor that he had unto his ^o^ne suffer malefactoures to go
fre and unpunished but that he must redeem them with his own deeth / which
thing Esayas.liij. does also confirm saying in the person of god the father:
for the sins of my people have I wounded hi^. What then shall be come of us /
sith his most dear and only son is so cruellye entreated? It must needs be
a marvelous and inenartable wrath toward us which could not be pacefyed but
through the deeth / ye and that through the deeth of Christ his best beloved
son And verelye if a man do mark diligently that the very son of God /
the image and wysdo^ of the father did suffer for our tra^sgressyons / to
reco^cyle us unto his father / there is no doubt but he shall tremble and
abhor his grievous iniquityes.

Further more emprent this thing surely and grave it in thy heart thou thy
self / art one of them which on this manner do torment and crucefye Christ.
For thy sins have cast him in to those torments according to the words of
Peter Acts.ij. where he amassed the Iues as with a thonder clappe saying unto
all that where present you have crucyfyed him. At which voice three thousand men
were astoyned and said unto the Apostles. What shall we now do brethren:
therefore when thou seyst the nails fastened in the hands of Christ / think
that those sharp nails are thy evil deades. When thou beholdest his brain
perced with the ceoune of thorns / think that those thorns are thy wicked
thoughts and setle ymaginacyons. And where thou seyst Christ pricked with one
thorn / remember that thou have deserved to be pricked a thousand fold moare
of the and greuouslye. Where thou seyst his hands and fete thrust through with
nails / remember that thou have deserved with out comparison moare cruel
pain. And surely they that despise the passion of Christ / shall without end
suffer most grievous torments. For the vehement wrath and rightuouse
punishment of god (which he well declared in that he would his only son to
dye for our transgressions) is no joined trifle / but the wyked and
unfaithful shall prove it in dead.

This sorrow and tremblinge found saint Barnarde out of Christ's passion /
saying in the third sermon of the birthe of our lord. Brethren / the
tears of christ do engender in me both shame and sorowweth fear. I was
playenge with out in chastyante / and in the kings secret chaumbre there
passed against me a sentence of does. The kings ^eare and only son hard of
this and went forth (layenge a side his costlye ^oches and precious diademes)
and clothed him self in sack cloth sprink king ashes on his head / going
ba^ef^te / wepinge and sobbinge that his servant was condemned unto death. I
behold him as he hasted out and wondered what now thing that might be: I
enquired the cause and he showed it me. What shall I now do? shall I play
stille and nothing regard his tears? Truly except I be mad or out of my
wit I ought to follow him / a morn with him fith he moorneth for me / Behold
the cause of shame / from whence spri^geth the sorrow and fear verelye when I
considre the medecyne and remedy / then of that may I esteem the qua^titye
and depth of my sin. I was clean ignorant and thought myself hole and
behold the tender child of a virgyn and son of God almyghtye was delivered
into the hands of the ungodly and commanded to be stayne / that he might
cure with the precyouse baume of his blood my festred wondes and corrupt
nature / we must needs knowleges grauitte that those were greuouse wounds /
for the which our Lord Christ must suffer and be wounded: if they had not
been to deeth / ye and that everlasting / the son of God should never have
suffered to have healed them. etc. Even to did Christ monishe the women of
Jerusalem: weep not for me / but for your own selves and chylder

He added a cause / for (quod he) if this be done in moist wodde / What shall be
done in dry / as though he should say if this be done in me which an^ pure and
innocen^^ / what shall be done in you which are hoellye corrupt and vicyatte?
ye may learn by this my passion what ye have deserved which pain (except ye
believe) ye can not escape / here to may we well apply the proverb: men smite
the whelpe to fear the great ba^ dog: christ was smyte^ innocent to give us
warning of our outragyous vices and enormityes. To this well agrees the
Prophet which says that all the nacyo^s of the earth shall bewail them
selves upon him. He says not that they shall bewail him / but that they
shall bewail them selves upon him. Even so were they dismayed Acts.ij. as is
before rehearsed. And the church syngeth: I shall surely remember it and my
soul shall melt with in me

And in this sorrowful bewaylinge of them selves ought the faithful
diligently to exercise them selves / for on this ha^geth the hole profit and
use of Christ's passion / that a man may know him self / that he might
tremble and repent in beholdinge his grievous enormytes / for truly except he
come to this point / the passion of Christ does nothing awayle him. This is
the pure and perfect operacyon that the passyo^ of Christ works with in us /
that we may be made like unto him that as Christ was greuouslye vexed both in
body and soul for our sins / even so that our conscience may scourge and
torment us for our own wykednesses which are so many and so great that they
are sone called to memory except we wylbe will fullye blind and not se that
which is most present and familyar with us. Let us use an ensample to make the
thing more euydent Be it in case that a certain kings son were slain. And
the murder ar taken and brought to the sessyo^s and accused before the judge
of this capital crime / which confesses openly that he has done the dead /
addinge that he did it at thy request and thou wast the chief auctor and
setter a work. If thou in the mean ceason were taking thy pastyme and
recreacyon / and suddenly were arested and cast in prison as accessorye of this
murder ye or rather as principal the other being but thy mynyster and
instrument of thy meschefe / would not even shortly thy mirth abate / the
color apale / thy flesh faynte and tremble Now if thy conscience did also
accuse the and iustefy^ against the that thou were iustlye ^npres^ned / what
raging^ hell and unquietness should thou then feale with in thy ha^^^. Even
so (...) not he more shall he be altered which do did remembers the passion of
Christ. For the Jude (although executyon be done on (...) as malefactors and
they abiecte f^^ the face of god) yet were they but the ministres of thy sin
/ For in very dead thy sins nailed him to the cross and were the hole cause
of his pain and does / as we have showed before.

Now if there be any so hard and insense^ ^e that they can another tremble
another yet begin to know them selves in the remembrance of this bitter
passion they sto^de surely in shrode case. For it is necessary that we be
made conformable unto the son of god / that is to say / that we feale the
depth and burden of sin other in this world or in time to come / ye and
that we quake / tremble and taste of the deadlye panges which Christ suffered
on the cross. But surely it is a miserable and pytuous thing to begin then
to feale them / when we are in the extremite and points of deeth. Therefore let
every man pray unto God that he would vouchsaffe to give us his sprete and
grace / which may mollifye our indurate hearts that we may with some fruit
call unto remembrance the passion of Christ / for I think no man is so mad to
suppose that we of our own power with out the sprete of God can do other this
or any other thing acceptable to God / for all goodness is of god and not of
us.

Nether do we teach the this or any other thing to thentent that thou
should think that thou were able to accomplish it of thine own power / but
only to monyshe the of thy duetye that when thou fealest thine own
imbecyllite thou may desire this grace of God / and through his help fulfill
that which is required of the. For the cause why those men a fore said did
vnprofytablye handle this passion / was this: they sturke hoellye unto their
own power and natural imaginacio^s nether ones desired the grace of god / and
so could they attain to no profit. But he that remembers the passion of
Christ on this manner as we have showed (all though it be but one hours space)
may well have the saying of Albarte verefyed upon him that he has been
better occupied / then if he had fasted every day a hole year to gether or
else had red over the hole Psalter of David / ye and I dare boldlye add that
he has better bestowed his time then if he had hard a hundredth massee / for
this goo^lye remembrance does even renew a man and does testifye unto his
conscience that he is regenerate and borne again / even in a manner as well as
baptyme. So that this is the pure and natural work of Christ's passion to
mortifye the old man of sin that rayneth / in our members to cast out all
hope and comfort that we have in creatures / and so deep to bring a man in to
the knowledge of his sin that he shall come even to the brincke of desperacyon
and think that he is forsaken of god. Yet it leaves hi^ not there but it
bri^geth him again with all co^solacyon and comfort and shows him that al
his outragyous enormityes are crucified with Christ and through his deeth put
out of the way that they can never accuse him more / and that the fathers
wrath is pacefyed by his sons deeth / and we al (as many as believe that
Christ's deeth has paid the ransom of our sin) are set at one with god
and are become his childer so that he is no more our judge which should punish
us for our inquityes / but will he called our mercyful father which forgeueth
his childrens transgressyons.

Now sith we can not thus frutefullye remember Christ's passion except we be
enspired with grace from above (for our impotent and viciate nature can do no
good without the sprete of god) the next remedy to obtain this fruitful
gifts is to pray and desire it of god our father / and all be it he give it
us not in the same time and moment that we would have it / yet let us not
despair and cease from prayer paraduenture he holds it from the to make the
more desirous of it and to set the more by it when it comes / and that thou
may know that it is not in thy power and will to have it at thy pleasure /
but this is a clear case that he will surely give it the when it shall be most
expedyent for his glory and thy wealth / which time no man knows but he
alone. Therefore let us prescribe hi^ no time / but ever submytte our w^lles to
his and pray that his will be fulfilled And contrary wise sumtyme he gives
us this gift before we pray or axe it / nether g^ueth he us a^ al times the
sprete to pray / but distributeth that gift also / eue^ a^ his own godly
pleasure nether will he that it be bound other to time place or any person.
When he has ones received the sprete which mollesyeth the harre and brings
him in to the remembrance of the passion / fly and by his heart tremblet^ he
lotheth him self and knowlegeth his infirmitye / so that the effect of the
passion is fulfilled in him in a manner before he be aware. But they that fall
to their meditacyons and behold this passyo^ being void of this sprete which
opens the heart / take great labors and are diligently occupied but all
about naught: for they can not her repent not yet perceive their own
infirmitye / which is the very end and effect of Christ's passion. So may
thou se that the first with our labor attain the fruit and profit of
Christ's passion all though it appear not outwardlye. And the other for all
their diligent study have nothing profyted / although they seem outwardlye to
have God by the foot. And thus does God turn topse turn a / that they which
are all day occupied in hearing masses and in remembringe Christ's passion
get none auantage / and the other which seem to do none of both / do both in
dead and obtain the hole profit.

Hitherto have we entreated the cross and passion of Christ by the
remembrance whereof we know our infirmityes / abhor our vices and are
clean overthrown ready to fall in to the pit of desperacyon / and now will
we touch how our consciences thus wounded and cast down must be lift up
again.

When a man begins on this manner to know and feale his sins and trembles
at the hydeous sight of them / let him take good head that those tremblinge
mocyons stick not to long in his conscience for so should he fall in to utter
desperacyo^ But even as that fear and knowledge of sin did spring out of
Christ's passion / so must our conscience unlade her self again and lay all
on Christ's back. But beware that thou do not as the unfaithful do / for
they when they feale their sin / that their conscience biteth the^ / they
run to their own good works / to satisfactio^s pilgrimages and pardons /
and so vex their meruelouslye their unquiet minds to rid them from their
burden / but their labor is in vain. And yet has that false confidence and
trust in satisfactio^s so spread it self / that it has founded many religious
cloystres in christendom / to the utter destruccyo^ of all christianite for if
I can make satisfaction for my sins / the is christ's blood shed in vain.
Therefore on this manner shall thou unlade thy mind and cast thy sins on
Christ. First thou must faithfullye believe / that Christ suffered for thy sake
even to redeem thy sins / and that he took the^ on his own back and made
full satisfaccyo^ for the^ unto his father / as Esa. says liij. the lord
laid on him all our iniquityes and.i. Pet. ij. he bare our sins in his
own body upon the cross. And Paul.ij Corin. v. God made him that knew no
sin / sin for us (that is to say a sacrifice for our sin) that we
through him might be that ryghtuousnes which before god is allowed. Now the more
that thy conscience boyleth and ryseth against the / the more shall thou cleave
to these and soch other comfortable sentences / and put thy hole fyaunce in
Christ an they teach the / for if thou god about through thy contricyon / and
satisfaccyon to pacefye and aswage thy ragynge conscience / thou shall never be
in suretye / but after intolerable labor and toylinge thou shall fall in to
utter desperacion / for the conscience can not be quiet when he fealeth his
sin / but estemeth is greater the^ that we of our own power should be able
to qwench it. Not with stondinge if he saw that Christ which is both god and
man had taken them upon him and had vaynquesshed them by his death / ye
a^dtyesinge again had triumphed upon death hell and the deuell: then should he
sone perceive how weak the stinge and power of sin is / for even as the
pains of his wounds and panges of his death do now no more remain in his
body: even so are all our sins vanysshed away like smoke to this well
agrees the saying of Paul Romansiiij. that Christ dyed for our sins and is
risen again to justify us.

That is the passion / and death of Christ does open / and declare our sins
unto us and so does take them away / but through his rysinge again are we
iustefyed and made fre from all our sins / if we believe.

How be it if we feale our unbelief that we can not be surely persuaded that
these things are true / them is the next remedy to fall unto prayer for this
also is in the hand of god nether is it given to every man but some have it
more and some less for god distributeth all at his pleasure. Not withstondinge
there are certain means and small paths by the which a man may have as it
were an entrance in to this faith / first turn thine eyes and behold the
hartye love and bounteous kindness of christ which so tenderlye loved the that
he would take on him self all thy sins / and louynglye enbrace the to hele thy
wounded conscience / if thou remember and think on this amitye thy heart shall
somwhate be refreshed and so shall thy trust in Christ be the more increased
and stablysshed.

After that thou have perceived this fervent favor that Christ had to wards
the then shall thou sone marcke what good will the father owed the / for then
shall it appear that Christ could not endue the with such great benefytes
except it had been before so decreed of his heuenlye father / for unto him did
Christ obey when he suffered for thy tra^sgressions. And so shall thou se the
flamynge cheryte of god the father toward the / and through crist shall thou
be so drawn to the father that thou may perceive the saying of Christ.
Ioa^. iij. God so loved the world that he gave his o^lye son for the^ tent
that none which believe in him should perysh but should have everlasting life.
And this is the true knowledge of god when we behold / and magnefye not his
puysaunt mageste or his incomprehensible prudence (for they make a man a frayde
of God) but rather his courteous and mercyefull benevolence wherein he may put
his confydence / and may be hoellye in god renewed.

And when thy heart is so confermed in Christ that thou begynnest with full
intent to hate thy sin not for fear of pain but for the love that thou have
unto god because thou would not displease him which is soch a merciful and
louinge father unto the: then is it expedient that thou take this passion for
an ensample by the which thou may order thy life but this remembrance is
far unlike the first / for hitherto have we recounted it as a secret
mysterye which should work in us and renew us through repentance / and when we
have obtained that profit then let us considre it as an ensample or rule to
order our lyffe and works / ever comparinge them unto Christ's passion on
this manner as follows.

When thou art dyseased with any sorrow or maladye: then think how small that
pain is if thou should comparte it with Christ's croune of thorn and the
nails which perced his tender flesh.

When thou art constrained to do or leave undone any thing which thou
would not: then remember that Christ was bound and tossed from post to
pillar even as it pleased his cruel enemies.

If thou be tempted with pride and lordlynesse: then mark how unworthily
Crist was mocked / ye and crucyfyed between two thieves / that he might be
reputed as one of their nombre.

If thou be assailed with wantonness or with the lust of the flesh: then
behold how cruellye the tender flesh of Crist was scourged torn and most
pituouslye wounded.

If thy heart boil with hate or envy and be full set to take auengeaunce:
then call to thy remembrance how Crist with a lamentable voice did pray unto
his father for the / and other his enemies / whom he might by good right have
punisshed perpetuallye.

If thou be vexed with any other afflictions whate so ever they are / whether
secret or open / take them on good worth and be not disquieted / but think
with thy self on this manner. It were a great shame if I should not suffer
pacie^tlye this small trouble / sith that Christ my Lord and sauyoure suffered
in the garden such panges that he swette drops of blood / for whate is more
shame then that the servant should take his ease and lie sluggeshlye in his
bed what time his master stondeth in ieoperdye of his life.

Behold / on this manner may thou comfort and stablish thy heart with the
passion of christ agenst all vexacyons. And this is the true meditacyon and
remembrance of Christ's passion out of which the a fore said commodityes
spring.

Therefore they that exercise them selves dilygentlye in it / are much better
occupied then if they hard a thousand times the story of the passion / or
sayet as many masses. And these only are the true Christen which on this wise
do express in their life or manners the name and life of Christ as Saint
Paul says: they that belong to christ have crucefyed their flesh and
concupiscentes with Christ.

Nether it is enough that we country fayte him in our outward be have our
and words / but we must do our endeueraunce perfeytlye to express his
passion in all oune conuersacyon from the botom of our hearts which thing.
Paul exhorts us unto Hebrew.xij.. Look unto Jesus the captain of our faith
/ which for the joy that was set before him abode the cross and despised
the shame / and is set dounne on the right hand of god. Consider therefore
how that he endured such speakinge against him of sinners / lest ye should be
weryed or faynte in our minds. And saint Petre.i. Pet.iiij. says for as
much as christ has suffered in the flesh / arm your selves likewise with the
same mind. How be it the manner of this remembrance is very rare and out of
use although Saint Paul and Saint Petre make eftsoon mention of it. And we
have changed it al to gether into an outward apperau^ce and have thought it
sufficient to behold the story of the passion painted upon walls. But there
are very few (ye almost none) that call it to their remembrance for thent
to know their sins by it / or to quiet their trembling consciences / or to
order and compare their liffe to this ensample.

Thus ends the meditacyon and fruitful remembrance of Christ's passion
which passes the contemplacyon of Monks / friars and Nonnes ye and all other
religious,

We purpossed (Christen brother) to have annexed the Christian Liberty / how
be it all things considered we thought it most profitable for this present
world to join rather unto the end of this book a devout exposicyon upon the
Psalm Miserere mei Deus

An exposicyon after the manner of a contemplacyon upon the.li. Psalm / called
Misereremei Deus.
ALas wretch that I am / comfortless / and forsaken of all men / which have
offended both heaven / and earth / whother shall I turn me. To whom shall If
lie for socoure? who shall have pytye or compassion on me unto heaven date I not
lift up mine eyts / for I have greuouslye sinned agenst it. And in the earth
can I find no place of defense / for I have been noisome unto it whate shall I
now do? shall I despair? God forbid full merciful is god / and my souyoure
is meake / and loving / therefore only god is my refuge he will not despise
his creature another forsake his own image unto the therefore most meke and
merciful good come I all sad and sorrowful for thou only art my hope / and
thou art on lie the toure of my defense. But whate shall I say unto the fyth
I dare not lift up mine yies? I will pour out the words of sorrow / I will
hartelye beseech the for mercy and will say.

Have mercy upon me (oh god) according to thy grace mercy.
God which dwell in light that no man can attain / God which are hid and
can not be seen with bodily yies / nor comprehended with any understanding
that ever was made nether expressed with the tongues of me^ or angels. My god:
the / which art incomprehe^sible do I seek: the / which can not be expressed
do I call upon what tinge so ever thou art / which art in every place. I
know that thou art the most hye and excellent thing / if thou be a thing
and not rather the cause of all thing / if I may so call the / for I find
no name by the which I may name or express thine inenarrable majesty. God (I
say) which art all things that are in the / for thou art even thine own
wysdom / thy power and thy most gloryouse felycyte. Seeing therefore that thou
art merciful / what art thou but even the very mercy it self? And what am
I / but very miserye? Behold therefore o god which art mercy / behold myserye
is before the / what shall thou do mercy? truly thy work can thou do
otherwise then thy nature is? And wha^te is thy work? verelye to take away
myserye / and to lift up them that are in wretched condicyon / therefore have
mercy on me oh god. God I say which art mercy take a way my miserye / take
a way my sins / for they are mine extreme myserye. Lift up me which am so
miserable show thy work in me / and exercise thy power upon me. One depth
requires another / the depth of myserye requires the depth of mercy. The
depth of sin areth the depth of grace and favor. Greater is the depth of
mercy then the depth of myserye. Let therefore the one depth swalow up the
other. Let the bottomless depth of mercy swalow up the profounde depth of
myserye.

Have mercy on me oh god according to thy great mercy. Not after the mercy
of men which is but small / but after thine own mercy which is great /
which is unmeasurable / which is incomprehensible / which passes all sins
without comparison. According to that thy great mercy with the which thou
have so loved the world / that thou would give thine only son / what
mercy ca^ be greater? what love ca^ be more / who ca^ despair who should not
have good confidence? god was made man / and crucefied for me^ therefore have
mercy on me oh God according to this thy great mercy by the which thou have
given thy son for us by which (through him) thou have taken away the sin of
the world: by which (through his cross) thou have lyghtened all me^ by when
(through hi^) thou have redressed all things in heaven and earth wash me (oh
Lord) in his blood / lighten me in his humilite / redress me in his
resurreccion. Have mercy on me oh God not after thy small mercy for that is
but thy small mercy (in comparison) when thou helpest me^ of their bodelie
euylles but it is great when thou forgeuest sins and do eleuate me^ by thy
favor above the top of the earth.

Eue^ so Lord have mercy on me accordi^ge to this thy great mercy that thou
turn me unto the that thou put out my sins and that thou iustefie me by thy
grace and favor.

And according to the mustitude of thy compassio^s wype away mine iniquyte.
Thy mercy Lord is the habundau^ce of thy pytye / by the which thou lokest
gentlye on the poor and wretched. Thy compassyons are the works and processes
of thy mercy. Marye magdalene came unto thy fete (good Jesus) she washed them
wither tears / and wyped them with her here / thou forgauest her and sentest
her a way in peace / this was (Lord) one of thy compassions / Petre denied
the and forsook the with an oath / thou lokedst upon him and he wept bitterlye
/ thou forgauest him and made him one of the chief among thine Apostles.
this was (lord) another of thy compassyons. The these on the cross was saved
with one word. Paul in the furious wodnes of his persecution was called and
by and by fulfilled with the holy ghost / these are Lord thy compassyons.

The time should fail me if I should enumbre all thy merciable compassyons / for
look how many ryghtwyse men there be / and so many are thy godly compassions
/

There is none that can glory in him self. Let them all come that are
ryghtwyse other in earth or in heaven and let us axe them before the whether
they be saved by their own power and virtue. And surely all they will answer
with one heart / and one mouth saying.

Not unto us (Lord) not unto us / but unto thy name give all the praise / for
thy mercy and for thy truths sake for they in their awneswerde possessed not
the land / and their own arm or power saved them not but thy right hand and
thine arm and the lighteninge of thy councenaunce for thou delitedst in the /
that is / they are not saved for their own deservings lest any man should
boste him self / but because it pleased the so to be which thing the Prophet
does also more expresselye witness of the when he says he saved me because
he would have me. Since therefore that thou arth the me god with whom is no
alteracyon or variableness nether art thou changed unto darkness: and we thy
creatures as well as out fathers which were borne under concupyscence sinners
as well as we and since there is but one mediatore and a tonement between god
and man that is christ Jesus which endures for ever / why do thou not pour
on thy plentuous compassions upon us / as well as thou did upon our
fathers? have thou forgote^ us? or are we only sinners: did not crist die for
us? Are all thy mercyes spent and none left.

Lord our god I desire and hartelye beseech the / to put out mine iniquite
according unto the multitude of thy compassions for many ye and infinite are
thy compassio^s that according (I say) to the multitude of thy co^passions
thou vouchsafe to quench my sin: that as thouhast draune and received
innumerable sinners / and have made the^ rightuous even so that thou will draw
and take me and make me rightwyse through thy grace and favor / therefore
according to the multitude of thy compassions wype away mine iniquyte. Cleanse
and purefye mine heart (after all mine iniquyte is put out / and all my
uncleanness cleansed) it may be as a clean table in the which the finger of god
may write the law of his love and cheryte with the which can none inyquyte
continue.

Yet wash me more from mine iniquite and cleanse me from my sin.
I grant and knowledge oh Lord thou have once put out mine iniquyte thou have
put it out again / And have washed me a thousand times / how be it yet wash
me from mine inyquyte / for I am fallen again. Do thou use to spare a
sinful man until a certain number of his sin / which when Peter inquired /
how of then shall my brother offend agenst me and I shall forgive him /
whether seven times? thou answeredst: I say not seven times but seuentye times
seven times taking that certain number / for an infynyte number / sith then
that a man must forgive so often / shall thou in pardoninge and forgiveness be
passed of a man? is not god more then man? is he not better then man ye rather
god is the great Lord / and every man lyuynghe is nothing but all vanyte.

And only god is good and every man a liar / have thou not said: In what
hour so ever the sinner does repent I will not remember any of his iniquities
Behold I a sinner do repent and morn / for mine old preuye sores festred
within and now are they broken forth for mine own folyshnesse. I am depressed
and fore broken / I walk in contynuall morning I am feeble / and very weak /
I roored for the sorrow of mine heart. Lord all my desires are before the and my
sorrowful syghes are not unknown unto the.

Mine harie trembles and pants for sorrow / my strength fails me and even
the very sight of mine yies cease from their office / wherefore them oh Lord
do thou not put away mine iniquity. And if thou put it out according to
the multitude of the multitude of thy mercyes / yet wash me more from mine
iniquyte for yet am I not perfeytlye purefyed / finysh thy work / take away
the hole offense and also the pain that is due unto the crime increase thy
light with in me / kendle mine heart with thy love and cheryte put out all
fear. Let the love of the world / the love of the flesh the love of vain
glory / and the love of myself utterly depart fro me / yet still more and
more wash me from mine iniquite by the which I have offended agenst my
neighbor / and cleanse me from my sin that I have committed agenst god.

I would have the put away not only the fault and pain that follows it /
but also the occasion and nourishment of sin wash me I say with the water of
thy gracyous favor / with water of which he that drinks shall not thirst
for ever / but it shall be made in him a fontayne of lyuinge water runninge in
to everlasting life, Wash me with the water of my tears Wash me with the
comfortable waters of thy holy scriptures that I may be enumbred among the^
unto whom thou saydest Now are ye clean for my words which I have spoken unto
you / Joan. xiij.

For I knowledge mine iniquite and my sin is ever before mine yies.
Although through the beholdinge of thy mercy and co^passyons I may be bold
to fly unto the (oh Lord) yet will I not come as the pharise which prayed not
but rather praised him self and despised his neighbor: but I come unto the
as the publicane Luc. xviij. which durst not lift up his yies unto heaven.
For I also do knowledge mine iniquite / and whiles I po^dre my sins I dare not
lift up mine yies / but humblinge my self with the publicane I say: God be
merciful to me a sinner. My soul wauereth between hope and fear / and
sometime for the fear of my sins (which I feale and knowelege to be in me) I
am ready to despair / sometime through the hope of thy mercy / I am lifted up
and comforted. Nevertheless because that thy mercy is greater then my myserie
I will ever Lord trust in the and will singe out thy plentuous co^passyons for
ever / for I know that thou desyrest not the death of a sinner / but rather that
he were converted and that he would knowledge his iniquite and forsake his sin
/ and so come to the that he may live.

My god grant me that I may live in the / for I knowledge my wykednesse / I
know what a grievous burden it is / how copyous / and how ieoperdyous. I am
ignorance of it / I hyde it not but set it eue^ before mine yies / that I
may wash it with my tears and knowledge unto the Lord mine vnrightwysnes
agenst my self: and also my sin which I have proudlye done agenst the / is
ever agenst me / and therefore is it agenst me / because I have sinned against
the And it is truly agenst me / for it is even agenst my soul and accuses me
ever before the ^^y judge and condemns me ever and in every place: and it is
so agenst me that it is ever before my face and stondeth butte agenst me that
my prayer may not perce through unto the / that it might take thy mercy from
and hinder thy mercy that it can not come at me: therefore do I tremble and
therefore do I morn besechinge thy mercy. Therefore (oh Lord) as thou have
given this grace unto me to know my wykednesse and to bewail my sin: even
so accomplysh this thy benevolence geuynge me a parfayte faith / and drawing
me unto thy son which has made a full satisfaccyon for all my sins. Give
me Lord this precious gift / for every good gift and every parfeyte gift
is from above coming from the father of light.

Agenst the only have I sinned: and have done that which is evil in thy sight:
that thou may be iustefyed in thy words: and may have the victory when
thou art judged
I have ouermoch sinned unto the alone for thou co^maundedst me that I should
love the for thy self / and should love all creatures for thy sake. But I have
loved a creature more then the / louinge it even for it self. Whate is sin /
but to love a creature for it self? and what is that / but to do against the?
Surely he that loves a creature for it self makes that creature his god.
And therefore have I sinned agenst the only / for I have made a creature my
god. So have I cast the away / and have been injurious only to the / for I
have not offended agenst any creature in that I have set my trust or confidence
in it. For it was not commanded me that I should love any creature for it
self. If thou had commanded me that I should have loved an angel only for
him self / and I had loved monye for it self / then no doubt I had offended
agenst the angel. But sith that thou only art to be loved for thy self (that
is to say without any respect other of good or evil) and every creature is
to be loved in the and for thy sake / therefore have I surely offended only
agenst the / for I have loved a creature for it self.

But yet have I worse done / for I have sinned even in thy sight. I was
nothing ashamed to sin before thy face. Oh merciful god / how many sins
have I done in thy sight which I would in no wise have done before mortal men /
ye that I would not in any case that men should know. I feared men more then
the / for I was blind and loved blyndnesse / and so did I another se nor once
co^sydre the, I had only fleshlye yies / therefore did I only fear and look
on men which are flesh. But thou lokedst on all my sins and numbered the^ /
therefore I can another hyd them from the / nether turn my back and fly from
thy face.

Whother shall I go from thy spryte and whother shall I fly from thy face?
what shall I then do? whother shall I turn me whom shall I find to be my
defender? whom I pray you but the my God? who is so good? who is so gentle?
who is so merciful? for thou passest with out comparison all creatures in
gentleness. It is one of thy chefest propertyes to forgive and be merciful /
for through mercy and forgiveness thou do most declare thy almyghtinesse: I
grant Lord that I have offended only agenst the / and have done that which
is evil in thy sight / have mercy therefore on me and express thy puysaunce
in me / that thou may be iustefyed in thy words: for thou have said: that
thou came not to call the rightwyse / but sinners unto repentance. Iustefye
me Lord according to thy words: call me / receive me / and give me grace to
do true works of repentance. For this cause wast thou crucified / deed and
buried. Thou saydest also: Joan.iij. When I am lyfted up from of the earth / I
will draw all unto my self / verefye thy words / draw me after the let us
run to gether in the sweetness of thine oyntmentes, Besides that thou
saydest: Mat. xi. Come unto me al ye that labor / and are laden / and I will
ease you. Loo I come unto the laden with sins / labouringe day and night in
the sorrow of mine heart refresh and ease me lord that thou may be iustefyed
and proved true in thy words / and may overcome when thou art judged for
there are many that say: he shall have no socoure of his god. God has
forsaken him. Overcome lord these persons when thou art thus judged of them
and forsake me not at any time. Give me thy mercy and wholesome socoure / and
then are they vaynqueshed. They say / that thou will have no mercy on me /
and that thou will cast me clean out of thy favor and no more receive me /
thus art thou judged of men / and thus do men speak of the / and these are
their determinacyons / but thou which art meke and merciful have mercy on me
/ and overcome their judgments / show thy mercy on me and let thy godly
pitye be praised in me. Make me a vessel of thy mercy / that thou may be
iustefyed in thy words and have the victory when men do judge the for men do
judge the to be firce and inflexible. Overcome their judgment with meekness
and benevolence / so that men may learn to have compassyon on sinners / and
that malefactors may be enflamed unto repentance / seeing in me / thy pytye
and mercy.

Loo I was fashoned in wekednes and my mother conceived me polluted with sin.
Behold not Lord the greuousnesse of my sins / consider not the multitude /
but look mercyfullye on me which am thy creature. Remember that I am dust / and
that all flesh is as wythred hay / for Loo I am fashoned in wekednes and in
sin has my mother conceived me. My natural mother (I say) has conceived
me of concupiscence / and in her am I polluted with original sin. What is
original sin / but the lack of original justice and of the right and pure
innocencye which man had at his creacyon? therefore a man conceived and borne in
such sin is hole crooked and out of frame. The flesh coueteth agenst the
sprete. Reason is slender / the will is weak / man is frail and like vanite /
his senses deceive him / his ymaginacyon fails him his ignorance leads him
out of the right way / and he has infinite impedyme^tes which pluck him from
goodness and drive him in to euel. Therefore original sin is the root of all
sins and the nurse of all wikednesse / for all be it that in every man of
the own nature it is but one sin yet in power it is all sins. Thou seyst
therefore Lord what I am / and of whence I am for in original sin (which
co^teyneth al sins and iniquites in it) am I fashoned / and in it has my
mother conceived me / sith then I am hole in sins and enuyroned with snares
one ^erye side how shall I escape? for what I would that do I not / but the
evil that I would not that do I / for I find a another law in my members
rebellinge agenst the law of my mind / and subduynge me unto the law of
sin and death. Therefore the more frail and entangled thy godly benevolence
sees me / so much the more let it lift up and comfort me. Who would not pitye
one that is syke? who would not have co^passyon on him that is dyseased? Come /
come thou sweet Samaritane and take up the wounded and half deed cure my
wounds / pour in wine and oil set me upon thy be / bring me in to the
hostrye / commit me unto the host / take out two pence and say unto him:
what so ever thou spendest above this / when I come again I will recompense
the.

Loo thou have loved truth / the unknown and secret things of thy wysdo^ /
have thou uttered unto me.
Come most sweet Samaritane / for behold thou have loved truth / the truth (I
say) of thy promyses which thou have made unto mankind / then have thou
truly loved: for thou have made and kept them / so that thy love is nothing
else but even to do good for in thy self thou art inuaryable and immutable /
thou use not now to love and a none not to love (as men do) nether does thy
love so come and goo / but thou art such a lover as does never change for thy
love is very god. Thy love therefore wherewith thou love a creature / is to do
it good / and whom thou most love / to them art thou most beneficyall.
Therefore what means that thou love truth / but that of thy gracyous mercy
thou make us promises / and fulfyllest them for thy truths sake? Thou dyst
promise unto Abraham a son when he was aged / thou falfylledst thy promise in
old and baren Sara / because thou louedst truth. Thou promysest unto the
children of Israel a land that flowed with milk and honye / and at the last
dydst give it them / for thy truths sake.

Thou made a promise to David saying: I shall set upon thy sete regal one
of the fruit of thy body / and it came even so to pass / because thou would
be found true. There are other innumerable promyses in which thou have ever
been faithful because thou louedst truth. Thou have promised to sinners which
will come unto the / forgiveness and favor / and thou have never defrauded
man / for thou have loved truth. That vnthryftye son Luc. xv. that took his
journey in to a far co^tre and wasted all his goods with covetous lyuinge /
when he came to him self / he retouened unto the saying. Father I have sinned
agenst heaven and before the / now am I not worthy to be called thy son /
make me as one of thy hired servants, / When he was yet a great way of /
thou saw him and had co^passyon on him and rannest unto him / falling
upon his neck and kissing him / thou broughtest forth the best garmenth and
put a ring on his finger and shows on his fete / Thou kylledst that
fatted calfe and made all the house merye saying / Let us eat and be merye
/ for this my son was deed and is alive again / he was lost and is now
found.

Why dydst thou all this Lord God? surely because thou louedst truth. Love
therefore (o father of mercyes) this truth in me / which return unto the from a
far country / run toward me and give me a kiss of thy mouth / give me
those chief garments / draw me in to thy house / kylle that fatted calfe that
all which trust in the may rejoice in me / and let us eat to gether in
spiritual feasts. Oh Lord will thou exclude me alone and will thou not keep
this truth unto me? if thou should look narowlye on our wykednesse o lord:
lord who might abide the? But Lord thou will not be so straight unto us / for
thou love truth: ye and that with a fervent and incomprehensible love.

Which is the truth that thou so love? is it not thy son that said
Joan.xiiij. I am the way / truth / and life? he is the very truth of whom all
truth is named in heaven and in earth / this is it that thou have loved and in
it only have thou delyted for thou dydest find it pure and with out spotte
and would that it should dye for sinners / keep therefore (Oh God) this truth /
behold I am a great sinner in whom thou may keep it / to whom thou may
forgive many sins / whom thou may purefye in the blood of thy Christ /
and whom thou may redeem through his passyo^ why (Oh lord) have thou given me
this knowledge of thy son / and this faith of him? Because I should se my
rede^pcyon and not to attain it that I might by that means be the more vexed
with sorrow? God forbydde / but rather that I may perceive the remissyon of my
sins purchased by Christ's blood / and so by his grace may obtain it.
Purge me therefore and redeem me oh Lord (for thou have uttered unto me the
unknown and secret points of thy wysdom) that this knowledge may help me
and bri^ge me unto health for truly the philosofers never knew these things /
they were unknown unto he^ / ye and utterly hid from the^: and no man knew
these things (except a few who^ thou lonest entyrelie) before thy sons
incarnacio^

The most curyous serchers of the world / I mean the wysemen of this world
lyfted up their yies above heaven and yet could not find this thy wysdom /
for thou have hyd these things from the wise and prudent / and have opened
them unto babes / that is / to humble fishers and thy holy prophets which
also have uttered the^ unto us. And so have thou uttered the unknown and
secret things of thy wysdom and of thy scriptures unto me / why do I know
the^ in vain? I know them surely in vain if they profytte me not unto my
health and salvation. For the Philosophers when they knew God by his marvelous
creatures they glorified him not as god nether were tha^kefull / but wexed full
of vanities in their ymaginacyons and their folish hearts were blinded / when
they counted them selves wise / they became soles / wylt thou suffer me Lord
to be of their number? God forbid / for thou art eue^ mercy it self which
does never utterly forsake any man / favor therefore Lord favor and spare
thy servant / and command him to be of the number of thy babes / that the
unknown secrets of thy wysdom / which thou have opened to him may lead him
unto the fountain of wysdom which is an hye / that thou may be praised in
the work of thy mercy which thou do exercise toward thy servant (Lord)
which never forsakest them that trust in the.

Sprinkle me Lord with hysope / and so shall be clean / thou shall wash me /
and then shall I be whitther then snow.
Because Lord that thou have loved the truth and have opened unto me the
unknown secrets of thy wisdom / I am well comforted and I trust that thou will not cast me out of thy favor / but thou shall sprinkle me with hysope
and so shall I be cleansed. Hysope is a low herb / it is hot and of a good
sauoure / which sygnifyeth nothing else / but thy only son our lord Jesus
Christ / which humbled him self unto deeth / even unto the deeth of the cross
/ which with the heat of his fervent charity loved us / and washed us from
our sins in his blood / which with the redolent sauoure of his benevolence
and righteousness replenyshed the hole world.

Therefore with this hysope shall thou sprincle me / when thou pourest upon me
the virtue of his blood: when Christ through faith shall dwell in me: when
through love I am joined with him: when I shall country fayte his humylite and
passion / then shall I be cleansed from all mine uncleanness. Then shall thou
wash me with mine own tears which flow out of the love of Christ / then
shall I sygh until I be werye I shall water my bed every night with my tears
/ so that it shall swymme in them and then shall thou wash me and I shall be
whyter then snow.

Snow is white and cold / but Lord if thou sprinkle me with hysope. I shall
be more white then snow for I shall be thorowlye endued with thy splendent
light which passes all bodily whytenesse. And when I am enflamed with that
light / I shall for sake all my carnal co^cupiscences cold unto wordlye
things / and enflamed unto heuenlye.

Unto my hearing shall thou give joy and gladness and my brosed bones shall be
refreshed.
Then Lord shall I pray unto the / etlye (that is in the begynni^ge of thy
light) shall thou hear my voice and I shall hear what the lord god shall
speak in me for he shall speak peace for his people and shall give me peace.
Lord thou shall give me peace for I have trusted in the / unto my hearing
shall thou give joy / and gladness / when I shall hear that comfortable
words that marye herd. And what herd marye (I speak of that marye / which
sat at the fete of Jesus Mat. xxvi.) what herd she: Thy faith has saved the
/ goo thy ways in peace. Let me also hear that the thief herd this day
shall thou be with me in paradyse / then shall I have joy for the remission of
my sins / and gladness for thy bounteous and liberal promyses shall I not
rejoice / and be glad / when thou shall give me two fold for all my sins?
them shall I begin to taste how sweet the Lord is then shall I learn to be
conuersaunte in heavenly things and shall say with the Pro^hete: how great
and copious is that swe^enesse Lord / which thou have laid up for them that
fear the / then shall I rejoice and be glad and my brosed bones shall be
refresshed. What are the bones which sustain the flesh but the powers of our
soul and reason that bear up the fraylte of our flesh that he run not
hedlonge in to all vices / that a man fall not hole in to vanyte and so
consume away. These bones I say are sore brosed / for the reason is very
weak / and the will is prone and ready to all myscheue / for even now the the
flesh obeys not reason / but reason must obaye the fles^e / so that I can not
resist vice / for mi bones are brosed. And why are they brosed for they have
forsaken the / the fountain of living water / and have dug for them selves
casterns full of thynnes which can hold no waters / for they are not filled with
thy grace with out which no man can live well / for without the we ca^ do no
thing. They trusted in their aw^e power which is no power and therefore decayed
they in their own folyshnesses Therefore let thy power come (Oh Lord) and then
shall these brosed bones be refresshed let thy grace come and that faith which
works through love. Let thy powers and gifts assiste me / and the^ mi brosed
bones shall be refresshed for my reason shall be merye / my memory glad and my
will full of joy / and thus shall they all rejoice / for above their own
natural strength / when they goo about any good work they shall proceed and
prospere well / nether shall they leave it vnperfeyte / but through thy help
shall they bring it to good pass and effect.

Turn thy face from off my sins / and wype away all my wykednesse.
Why lokest thou Lord upon my sins why numbrest thou them? why consider
(...) them so dyligentlye? do thou not know^ that man is even as a flower of
the feld^ / why do thou not rather look in the face of thy Christ? Alas
wretch that I am / why se I the angrye agenst me? I grant I have sinned / how
be it for thy gentleness have mercy on me. Turn thy face from off my sins.
Thy face is nothing but thy knowledge turn away therefore thy knowledge from my
sins I mean not that knowledge where with thou seist and perceauest all
things / but that wherbye thou approuest and disalowest all things / wherbye
thou alowest the works of the ryghtwyse and condemnest the reprouable sins
of the wyked / know not my sins on that manner that thou would impute them
unto me and lay them to my charge. But rather turn away thy face from my
sins that through thy mercy they may be quenched look Lord on the ceeatuere
whom thou have wrought / look upon thine own image. For I poor wretch have
put upon me the image of the deuell (that is sin) turn away thy face from
the image of the deuell and be not angrye with me / and behold thine own image
that thou may have mercy on me:

O merciful Lord / remember that thou lokedst upon zacheum which did clym
up in to a wild fig tree to se the. Lu. xix. and thou entredst in to his
house which thou would never have done if thou had looked on the image of
the deuell which he had put on him / but because thou sauest thine own image
in him / thou had compassion on him and heledst him. He promised to give
the half of his goods to the poor / and if he had falslye deceived any man
to restore it four fold and he obtained mercy and health. And I bequeth my
self even hole unto the nothing reserved And promise to serve the for ever
with a pure heart / and will fulfylle my promise all days of my life wherefore
then Lord do thou not look on thine image in me also? why do thou yet
consider my sins.

Turn I beseech the thy face from my sins and wype away all my wykednesse /
wype away all I pray the that none remain / for it is written he that keeps
the hol^ law and offends in one point is gyltye in the hole / that is to
say / has deserved damnacyon / which is the pain of all sins that lead
unto death. Put out therefore all my wykednesse / that none offe^de the which
should bring me to condemnacion.

A pure heart create in me oh god and an upright sprete make a new within me
For my heart has forsaken me / and goes astraye utterly forgettinge his
own health it is wa^dred in to strange countres and ensues vanities and his
yies / are in the utmost coostes of the world I called it again but it
answered me not. It is gone / lost and sold under sin. What nv lord? what
shall I say. A pure heart create i^ me god / an humble heart / a courteous
heart / a peaceable heart / a gentle heart / a devout heart / soch an heart as
will nether do a another man hurt / nether yet aue^ge him self when he is
offended but rather do god against evil. And soch an heart as will love the
above all thing which will think of the / speak of the and thank the which
will delight in hymns and spretuall songs and be hole conuersaunte in heuenlye
things. Create this heart in me (Oh God) treat it of nothing / that it may
be of such effi^acite through grace as nature is never able to make it. This
grace comes only from the in to the soul through thy creacyon it is the
beautye of a pure heart / it draws unto him all virtue and expels all vice
/ therefore create i^ me Oh god a pure heart through thy grace / and make a new
an vpryght sprete in mi bowels.

For thy sprete shall lead me in to a right way / which shall purge me from
all erthy affectes and shall lift me up unto heue^lie things. The lover and
the thing that is loved are both of one nature. He that loves bodelie things
is wordlye but he that loves spretuall things is spretuall. Give me a sprete
that may love the and worship the / the most hye sprete / for god is a
sprete and they which worship him / must worship him in the sprete and
verite. Give me an upright sprete not schinge his own profit and glory / but
the will and glory of god renew an vpryght sprete with in me renew it. For
my sins have qwenched the first that thou gave me. Give me now a new sprete
that it may redress that thing which is inueterate my soul is also a sprete
and so made of the that of her self she is right for of her own nature she
loves the above her self and desires all things for thy glory / so that
her own natural love is right / for it comes of the / but of her own
froward will is it i^ueterate and polluted causinge her natural love to
decay. Make new therefore this s^te and this love through thy grace that it may
walk i^ the right way accordi^ge to his nature renew it (I say) that it may
ever inflame me with heue^lye love that it may ever cause me to sighe unto the
/ to enbrace the continuallye and never to forsake the.

Cast me not away from thy face / and thy holy ghost take not from me
Behold Lord I stand before thy face that I may find mercy I stand before
thy benign goodness lokinge for thy favorable a^swere cast me not co^fused
from thy face who came ever. Lord unto the and went away confused. Who ever
desired thy favor / and went with out it. Surely thou passest in thy
abundant pytye both the deseruinges and also the desires of the^ that pray
unto the / for thou geuest more then men can desire ye or understand when
they have it. It was never hard that thou dydst cast away from they face any
man that ever came unto the Shall I Oh Lord be the first that shall be cast
away from thy face and utterly confounded? will thou begin at me to
confound them that come unto the? will thou never more have mercy and
compassion? God forbid. The woman of Canane followed the / she cried and made
a pytuous noise / she moved thy dysciples / unto compassion / and thou hyldest
thy peace / she continued knocking / she worshipped the and said. Lord help
me / nether yet would thou answer. Thy dyscyples entreated for her saying:
let her goo for she cries after us. But what was thine answer Lord I pray
the / what dydst thou answer: for south that she wept in vain / and labored
for naught / for thou saydst that thou wast not sent but unto the sheep that
were perysshed of the house of Israel.

What should this woman do when she hade these words? verelye even despair as
concerning the grace that she required: and yet despayred she not / but
trusting in thy mercy prayed again saying: Lord help me / unto wose
importunite (Lord) thou answeredst / it is not good to take the chyldrens
bread and cast it to hondes as though thou should have said depart from me
you Canaanites are dogs / ye are Idolatres / the precious gifts of he ven^ye
favor partayne not unto you I ought not to take them a way from the Iues
which worship the true and living god / and to give the^ to soch dogs as
ye are which worshuppe ydolles and deuels what shall thou now do thou woman of
Canaan? thou may now be a shamed and get the away / for the Lord is
angrye not with the alone / but also thy hole nacyon. Oh Lord god / who would
not have been confounded and have pyked him away at these thy words? who would
not have mumbled and grugged agenst the? who would not have judged the to be
cruel? And yet did this woman continue stille in prayer. She cast not away her
confidence / she took not these hard words heuelye / she was n^^ angrye / but
she humbled her self the more and abode stylle in her petycion and said with
good fyaunce. It is truth Lord that thou say / but I axe nobrred / I axe
not the favor that thchyldren should have. I am a little when elpe and desire
the tromes whyth fall from thy chyldrens table. Let them storys^ and abound
with miracles / and other gracyous favors / but let not me be destytute of
this trumme of grace / that my douhter may be delivered from the fendes
possession for the whelps do rate of the trummes which fail from their
masters tables. Behold wat faith / whate trust / and what humylyte was in this
women? therefore thou / not dyspleased with her ymportunate instaunce but
reioysinge in her excellent constauncie dydst say O woman great is thy faith
/ be it unto the as thou will. Why are these things written Lord god? that we
may learn to trust in the / that me may humblye and deuoutlye continue in
prayer / for thou will give it if men be greadye.

But the kingdom of heaven suffers violence / and they that make violence
unto is catch it / for what things so ever are written are written for our
lerninge that through patience and comfort of the scriptures we may have hope.

Cast me not therefore lord from thy face which stond wepinge and way linge
day and night before thy face / not that thou should deliver me from the
bodily oppression of deuyls / but that thou will deliver my soul from his
spiritual power and dominion.

Let me not be shamed (O sweet Jesus) for in the only have I trusted I have no
health or comfort but in the o Lord / for all have forsaken me / eue^ my
brothre^ and children have cast me of and mine own bowels abhor me. I have
no another helper / but only the. Cast me not therefore away from thy face /
and take no^ thy holy sprete for me There is noma^ which can say that Jesus
is the Lord but by the holy ghost therefore if I call upon the lord Jesus /
that do I in the holy ghost / if I be sorye for my sins which are passed / if
I are forgiveness / this do I verelye. by the holy ghost. Therefore I beseech
the take not fro me thy holy ghost / but that it may be with me / and labor
with me / for we wot not what to desire as we ough to do. But the sprete
helps our infirmityes and makes intercession for us / that is / makes us
to pray with such sorrowful groninges as can not be expressed with tongue
therefore take not away this thy holy sprete fro me / that he may teach me to
pray / and help me in my labor and may cause me to continue in prayers and
tears / that at the lengh I may find favor before thy face and may serve
the all days of my lyffe.

Make me again to rejoice in thy saving health and strengthen me with a
pryncypall sprete.
he is a great thing that I desire o Lord Iow be it since thou art god a
great Lord / and king over all gods / he does the iniurye which asks
small things of the. All transitorye and corruptible things are but small in
thy sight: but spyrytuall and everlasting things are great / and precious.
Take away the sprete / and soul from the body / and what remains but most
vile dounge dust and a vain shadow therefore eue^ so much difference is
between the sprete and the body / as is between the body and his shadow / so
may I conclude that he which asks bodily things asks but vain tryfles
but he that desires spyrituall things does surely desire great things / but
specially he that desires thy sauinge health / what is thy saui^ge health but
Jesus thy son? which is very god / and everlasting liffe / why shall I not
then ask of the this thy sauyoure / since thou art amyghtye and most liberal
father / which gave him unto the deeth of the cross for me. Now since thou
have so offered him for me / why should I be ashamed to ask him of the? It is a
great and noble present nether am I worthy to have such a gift how be it it
becomes thy worthy lyberalyte to give such noble gifts / for this therefore
tyne ineffable gentleness I dare presume to come boidlye unto the and to
desire thy sauinge health in whom I might fullye rejoice. For if of his carnal
father any son ask fysh / will he teach him a serpent. And if he ask an
egg / will he give him a scorpion? or if he ask breed / will he give him a
stone? Now if carnal fathers being evil and sinners / will give unto their
childer good gifts which they have received of the: how much moare thou
heuenlye father which of thine own substance art good / wilt give a good
sprete to the^ that desire it of the? Behold thy son which is returned from
a far country sorowinge and repentinge / asks of the the fish of faith /
for as the fish lies secret under the water / even so is faith of such
things as are not seen / he asks I say a true faith that he may rejoice in
thy sauinge health: will thou reath him a serpent? will thou give him the venom
of unfaithfulness which proceadeth from that old and crooked serpent the deuell I
desire of the o Lord the egg of hope / that even as out of an egg we hope
for a chyken / so through hope / that thou will grant me to come unto the
sight of thy saving health that out of my hope may come this wholesome sight
as the chicke does out of the egg. I desire the egg of hope / that my soul
through hope may be sustained in this vale of tears and may rejoice in thy
sauinge health. Will thou give me the scorpion of desperacyon that as a scorpion
has poison in the end of her tail / so I in the last end of miliffe should
reserve sin / delytinge my self and taking he my pleasure with the
entiseme^tes of this world which seem beautiful and flateringe / eue^ as a
scorpion does in the face.

I desire of the also (o Lord) the breed of Christ's cherite by the which he
does communycate him self (even as breed) unto all men / that I may ever
rejoice in thy saving / health / will thou give me a stone / that is to say
hardness of heart? God forbid / why shall I them my struste for to desire and /
and obtain great things of the o Lord / saying thou sturrest me up / and
byddest me ask and knock / even till I se me importunate? And what thing can
I ask which thou shall be better content with all / or else that should be moare
wholesome for me them that thou should make me rejoice in thy son our
sauinge health.

Now have I tasted how sweet the Lord is / how easy / and pleasant his
burden is. I remember whate peace and tranquilite of mind I was in / when I
ioyed in god. And reioysed in Christ my Lord and sauyoure / therefore am I now
in moare sorrow / for I know what goodness.

And commodylye I have lost / therefore will I cry more importunatlye: Make me
again to rejoice in thy saui^ge health restore me again that thing which my
sins have lost. Restore me that which through my fault is perysshed in me.
Restore me (I beseech the for his sake that ever is on thy right hand and
makes intercession for us) thy gracious favor / that I may perceive that
through him thou art pacefyed toward me / that it may be as a seal upon my
heart / and that I may say with the Apostle Paul Gala. ij. I am crucefyed
with Christ / I live verelye / yet now not I / but Christ lives in me.

But because my frayltye is great / stre^ght me with a pryncypall sprete that
no troubles or afflyctions may separate me from Christ / that no fear may
cause me to renye the and that no pains may make me slide from the. My
strength is not suffycyent to resyst / and fight with that old serpent / and
to prevail agenst him.

Peter has taught me how great our infirmitye is / he saw the with his
bodily yies (Lord Jesus) and was most familiarlye conuersaunt with the: he
tasted of thy glory in the mountain / when thou wast tra^sfigured: he hard
the fathers voice: he saw thy manifold and wondrous works / ye and through
thy power did him self many miracles. He walked on his fete upon the waters /
and hard daily thy mighty and sweet words: he thought him self most
fervent and hot in the faith and said that he was ready to go with the both
in to preson and unto very deeth. And when thou toldest him that he should
deny the he believed the not the trusted in his own strength / and trusted
more unto him self being but a man / then unto the being very god. But when
the handmayden said unto him. Thou art of the same company / he was afraid
by and by and denied it.

There came a another maid and said: Surely thou art of the same folk: And
he denied the again.

He could not stand before weme^ / how should he then have stand before kings
and tyrauntes? And when he was yet once moare enquired of the bystanders and
was accused to be one of his disciples / he began to curse and to swear that
he knew the not / what think you he said? I suppose that he swear by god and
by the law of Moses that he knew the not / addi^ge such words. Think you
that I am the disciple of this Sama^ ^ane which / deceaueth the people which is
inspired with the devil and destroys our law? I am the disciple of Moses /
and know not from when^^ this fellow is. Blissed be God that they acused
enquyri^ge any further / for else would he never have ceased denyenge the / so
that a thousand interrogacyons would have made a thousand staite negacyons:
ye a thousand curses and periuryes: yet were these interrogacyons but words /
what would he have done (I pray the) if they had scourged him and buffeted him
well? Truly he would have sought and proved all means / denyenge / forsweringe
/ cursinge / and blaspheminge until that he had escaped their hands. But thou
most meke Lord lokedst back upon him and by and by he knowleged his offense.

Nether yet durst he lepe in to the mids of them and confess the to be the
son of God / for he was not yet strengthed with power from above / so that
with our doubt he would have denied the again / if he had seen any ieopardye at
hand / therefore as it was most mere for him / he went^ forth and wept
bitterlye. But thou after thy resurrecyon appearedst unto him and confortedst
him / and yet kyd he him self for fear of the Iues? he saw the so
gloryouslye assendynge unto heaven and was strengthed by the sight and comfort
of Angels / and yet durst he not go abroad / for he had learned by experyence
to know his own fragilite / and had proved his wekenesse.

Therefore did be tarry and wait for the holy ghost which was promised / when
he was come and had filled Peter's heart with grace / then stepte he forth: then
began he to speak / and then with great power and signs bare he witness
of thy resurreccyon.

Then feared he nether the hit preastes nether yet kings / but reioysed in
tribulacyons and received the cross with all m^^th and gladness. Therefore
strengthen me Lord with a principal sprete that I may contynuallye rejoice
in thy saving health / or else can I not bear so many assautes agenst me. The
flessh coueteth contrary to the sprete. The world assayleth me on eueryesyde.
The deuell slepeth not.

Give me the strenght of thy sprete that the there may fallely my side a
thousand an^ then thousand by my right hand that I may be a sure and strong
witness of thy says. For if Peter whom thou enduedst with so many favorable
gifts / did fall so wretchedlye / what should I do Lord which have nether
seen thy natural presence: nether have tasted of thy glory in the mountain:
nether have seen thy gracious miracles: ye and have scarcelye perceived thy
marvelous works / and have never hard thy voice / but have been ever subdued
under sin therefore strength me with a principal sprete that I may persevere
/ in thy service and give my lyffe for thy sake.

I will enstructe the wyked that they may knowethy ways / and the ungodly
shall be converted unto the.
Ascribe not this oh Lord unto presumcyo^ / if I go about to the teach the
ungodly thy ways / for I desire not to teach the^ as I now am wyked /
ungodly / and under the bo^des of sin / but if thou make me again to
rejoice in thy saui^ge health: if thou strenghten me with a principal sprete:
and if also thou set me fre / then shall I teach the ungodly thy ways.
Nether is this hard unto the / which of very stones can raise up children
unto Abraham / nether can my sins be impediment unto the if thou will do this
/ but rather where sin is so abundaunte / there abounds grace Paul yet
brethinge out threateninges and slaughter agenst the disciples of the lord
received co^missyon that if he found any whether they were men or weme^ which
followed the and professed thy faith / he should bring them presoners to
Jerusalem. And forth was he going like a mad harebrayne and as a raueninge
volfe / for to straye abroad / rauysh and kylle thy sheep. But whylles he was
yet in his journey even in the hete of his persecucyon / and in actual doing
of his sin / whiles he was persecutinge the and would have slain thy chosen /
having no manner of preparatyue unto grace / nether yet knowledge of his sin /
when with heart and will he was thine aduersarye / blasphemed and cursed the.
Behold the voice of thy merciable pitye unto him saying: Saute / Saul why
persecute^^ me? by the which voice he was immedyatlye both said alonge and
raised up he was layede alonge and overthrown as concerning his body / but
he was raised up with the mind thou raysedst him up that was in the sleep of
dark ygnorauncye and pouredst in thy glorious light in to those yies which
were oppressed with this blind sleep: thou shewedst him thy sauourable face
and endued him with thy gracyous mercy. Then was he raised as it had been from
deeth / he opened his yies / he saw the and said: Lord what will thou that I
do? And after dydst thou send a sheep to his wolf / for thou commaundedst
Ananias to go unto him: And then was he baptized and anon was he replenyshed
with the holy ghost and was made a chosen vessel to bear thy name before
kings / nacyons and the childer of Israel. And with out delay he entered in to
the synagoges and preached thy name stoutelye / affirmi^ge that thou art
Christ / He disputed / prevailed and confounded the Iues. Behold Lord even
streyte of a persecutoure / thou made him a preacher and such a preacher that
labored more the^ all the other apostles. O / how great is thy power / if
thou wylt of a wyked man make a right wise / or of a persequntoure a preacher /
who shall forbid the? who shall resyst the? who may say unto the / why do
thou so? All things that thou would have thou made in heaven and in earth /
(...) these and in all bottomless depth.

Therefore impute it not to arroga^cye if I couete through thy power and not
through mine own to teach the wyked thy ways for I know that I can offer
nothing which ca^ be so acceptable i^ thy godly sight this is the most
pleasant sacrifice / and also for my singular profit / now if thou change
me in to a another man / the^ will I teach the wyked thy ways / not the ways
of Plato and Aristotle / not the intricate and so^le proposycyo^s of man's
wit / not the instructions of philosophy / not the painted words and vain
colors of the rethoricyans. Not wordlye matters and policyes / not unfruitful
ways of vanitye / not ways that l^ad men i^to deeth: but thy ways and thy
precepts which lead unto lyffe / another will I teach the^ o^lye one way but
many ways for many are thy co^maundmentes / how be it all the ways end in
one / that is in love and charity / which does so co^bynde the faithful hearts
/ that they have one mind and one will in god. Or else may we understand by
thy many ways / the diverse manner of lyuinge / wherein every man walks
according to his vocacyo^: some married / some lyuinge chaste in wedowhod /
some virgyns and so forth / these walk after diverse ways unto their heuenlye
inheritance every man choosing one in the which he may best subdue his
rebellious members. Thus will I teach the wyked thy ways according to their
capacite and co^dicyon. And the ungodly shall be converted unto the for I will
preach unto them not my self / but Christ crucyfied: and they shall be converted
not unto my praise / but unto the geuynge the all honor and praise / they
shall leave their own ways and come unto thine / that they may walk in them
and so co^sequentlye attain unto the.

Deliver me from bloudes (oh God) the God of my hefth / and me tongue shall
triumph upon thy ryghtwysenes.
I am stifled in much blood / and from the depth of it shall I cry unto the
Lord / lord herke unto my voice. Tarry not lord for I am even at the wynte
of deeth / this blood that I speak of are my sins / for as the bodily
lyffe co^systeth in blood / eue^ so is the lyffe of a sinner in his sin:
pour out the blood / and the beast dies: pour out the sin knowleginge it
unto God / and the sinner dies and is made rightwyse. Nether am I wropped in
blood / but over whelmed and drouned in bloudes / full streams of bloudes do
drive me unto hell / help me Lord / lest I perysh. Oh god which gouernest
all things / which only can deliver me / in whose hand is the sprete of
lyffe / tyd and purge me from these bloudes. Deliver me from bloudes (oh God)
the auctor of my health / God in whom only co^systeth my saluacyo^. Deliver me
Lord / as thou delyuerest Noe from the waters of the floude Deliver me as thou
delyuerest Loath from the fire of Sodom. Deliver me as thou delyueredst the
children of Israel from the depth of the red see / deliver me as thou
deliueredst Jonas from the belie of the whale / deliver me as thou deliuerest
the three children from the furnace of burninge fire Deliver me as thou
deliueredst Peter from the peril of the sea. Deliver me as thou deliueredst
Paul from the deep of the sea. Deliver me as thou have deliueredst infinite
sinners from the power of deeth / and from the gates of hell. And then shall my
tongue triumph thy ryghtwysenes / that is / for thy ryghtwysenes which I shall
feale and perceive in me through thy gracious favor For thy rightwysenes (as
thappostle says Roma.iij.) comes by the faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
upon all the^ that believe in him / then shall my tongue triu^phe in praysinge
this thy ryghtwysnes / co^mendinge thy favor / magnifyenge thy pitye
knowleginge my sins / that thy mercy may be declared in me which would
vouchsaffe to iustefye soch a great sinner / and that all men may know that
thou sauest them which trust in the and deliuerest the^ from extreme anguysh
and aduersyte o lord our God.

Lord open thou my lyppes: and then my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
Thy praise is a great thing o Lord / for it proceadeth out of thy fou^tayne
whereof no sinner drinks. It is no glorious praise that comes of a sinners
mouth / deliver me therefore from blood (oh God) the god of my health and my
tongue shall magnifye thy rightwysenes. And the^ shall thou lord open my
lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise / for thou have the kaye of
David which shettest and no man opens / and openest and no man shetteth /
therefore open thou my lyppes as thou openedst the mouths of infantes and
suckelinges / out of whose mouths thou have stablyshed thy praise. These
truly were thy Prophets / Apostles and other saints which have praised the
with a syngle and pure heart and mouth / and not the Philosophers and oratoures
which have said / We will magnefye our tongue / our lyppes be in our own
power / who is our god? They opened their own mouths / and thou openedst
them not / nether yet stablishedst thy praise out of their mouths. Thy
infauntes Lord praised the and despised them selves.

The Philosophers went about to praise them selves and magnifye their own
name. Thy suckelinges extolied thy fame and glory which they knew through
heavenly favor. The philosophers knowinge the only by natural creatures /
could never perfeytlye express thy renown. Thy saints magnefied the with
their heart / mouth and good works. The Philosophers only with words and
their own sotle ymaginacyo^s / thy children have spread thy glory through out
all the world. The Philosophers have enstructe but a few of their own
adherentes. Thy friends with spredinge thy glory have converted innumerable
men from sin unto virtue and unto true felicite. The Philosophers nether
knew true virtues nether yet true felycite. Thy beloved have preached openly
thy bounteous gentleness and merciable favor / which thou shewedst in thy
dear son unto all the world. But the Philosophers could never attain to
know it. Therefore out of the mouth of infauntes and suckelinges have thou
stablyshed thy praise. For it has ever pleased the to exalte the humble and
bring low the proud / now seeing thou do ever resyst the proud / give me
true humilite that thou may stablish thy praise by my mouth. Give me a
chyldes heart / for except I turn back and become as a child I can not enter
in to the kingdom of heaven / make me as one of thy infauntes or suckelinges /
that I may ever hang on the teates of thy wisdom for thy teates are better
then wine / and thy wisdom better then all richesse / so that nothing can be
compared unto it / for it is to men an infinite treasure which they that use
are made part takers of the frendshippe of God / therefore if thou make me a
child then shall thou stablish thy praise in mouth for then shall thou open my
lyppes and my mouth shall show forth thy praise and shall perfeytlye declare
it even as thou have published it by the mouth of thine infauntes and
suckelinges.

If thou had desired sacrifices I had suresye offered the^ but thou
delightedst not in burnt sacrifices.
My mouth lord shall show for thy glorious fame / for I know that this
thingeis most acceptable unto the / sith thou say by the Prophet
Psalm.xlix. the sacrifice of praise shall glorifye me / and by that means
shall I be entysed to show him my saving health / therefore will I offer praise
unto the / even the praise of infauntes and suckelynges for my sins. And why
shall I offer for my sins rather praise then sacrifice? for if thou had
desired sacrifices I had surely offered them / but thou delyghtedst not in
burnt sacrifices / can thou be pacefyed with the blood of calves / or
gootes: will thou eat the flesh of bulls / or drink the blood of gootes?
Other do thou desire gold which possessest heaven and earth? other will thou
that I sacrifyce my body unto the which desyrest not the deeth of a sinner /
but rather that he were converted and live?

Nevertheless I will chasten my flesh in a measure that through thy grace it
may be subdurd unto reason and obey it / for in this point also if I pass
measure and bring my body so low that it is on apt to serve my neighbor
and to do that office which is appointed me of god / it shall be imputed unto me
for sin. Let your serving of god be reasonable says the apostle Roma.xli.
And thou have said also by the Prophet I require mercy and not sacrifice
Os^e.vi. Therefore shall my mouth show forth thy praise / for this oblacyon
does honor the / and shows us the way unto thy saving health. My heart is
ready (Oh God) my heart is ready / it is ready through thy grace to do all
things which are pleasant unto the: this one thing have I found most
acceptable unto the / that will I offer unto the / that shall ever bein my
heart / on that shall my lippys ever be harpinge. If thou had desired a
bodily sacrifyce I would surely have given it the / for my heart is ready
through thy grace to fulfill thy will: but in such burnt sacrifice have thou no
delyght / Thou made the body for the sprete / therefore seakest thou
spiritual things and not bodily / for thou say in a certain place
Prouer. xxiij. My son give thine heart unto me / this is the sacrifice that
pleases the. Let us offer unto the an heart repentinge with sorrow of our
sins and enflamed with the love of heuenlye things and then wylt thou desire
no more / for with such a sacrifice wylt thou be content.

A sacrifice to God is a broken sprete / a contrite and humble heart thou shall
not despise (o God).
A broken sprete and not broken flesh pleases the (o Lord) for the flesh is
broken and vexed because he has not the carnal things that he desires / or
else fealeth in himself such things as he hates. But the sprete is broken and
vnquyeted for his fault / because he has offended agenst God whom he loves.
He soroweth that he has sinned agenst his maker and redemer / that he has
despised his blood / that he has not regarded such a good and loving father:
this broken and sorowinge sprete is unto the a sacrifice of most sweet sauoure
which not withstondinge has his co^feccyon of most bitter spices / even of the
remembrance of our sins / for whiles our sins are gathered to gether in
to the mortoure of the heart / and beaten with the pestle of co^punccyon / and
made in to prouder and watered with tears / thereof is made an ointment and
sacrifice most sweet which redolent offering thou wylt not despise / for thou will not despise a contrite and humble heart. Therefore he that breaks his
stony heart which is made with the most hard stones of sin / that he may
thereof prepare an oyntme^t of repentance in abu^daunce of tears / not
despayringe of the multitude and greuousnes of his sins / but humbly
offeringe this sacrifice unto the he shall in no wise be despised of the / for a
broken and humble heart will thou not despise oh god. Marye magdalene which was
a notable sinner made such an ointment: and put it in the alablaster box of
her heart: she feared not to enter in to the Pharesees house / she humbled her
self flat before thy fete / she was not a shamed to weep at thy mele tide /
she could not speak for inward sorrow / but her heart melted i^to tears /
with the which she washed thy fete / she wyped the^ with her here / anointed
the^ with oyntmente and ceased not kyssinge them who ever saw such a another
thing? ye or who has ever hard of a thing like unto this. Surely her
sacrifice pleased the well and was so acceptable that thou preferredst it above
the Pharyse which in his own sight was ryghtewyse / for it may (...) gathered
of thy words. Luce. vij.

That there was so much difference between the rightewissenes of marye and the
pharise as there was difference between these: to wash the fete with water /
and to wash them with tears: to kiss one on the face and not to cease to
kiss the fete: to anoynte the head with oil / and to anoynte the fe^e with
most precious oyntme^t: ye much more precelled he the pharise / for he nether
gave the water / kiss nor oil. O great is thy power Lord / great is thy
might which declares it self most cheflye in spacinge / and having
compassyon. Now se I well that a contrite and meke heart thou shall not despise
oh Lord.

And therefore endeavor I miselfe to offer such am heart unto the Neter is it
enough that I say so outwardlye / for thou art a god which serchest our
hearts and reins. Accept therefore this my sacryfyce: and if it be vnperfeyte
/ amend thou the defaute which only art of power that to do: that it may be
a burnt sacrifyce / all hole enflamed with the here of thy bounteous cheryte
that it may be acceptable unto the or at the least that thou despise it not
for if thou despise it not I know well that I shall find favor before the /
and then shall none of thy saints other in heaven or earth despise me.

Deal gentlye of thy favorable benevolence with zion Let the walls of
Jerusalem be bist again.
Because it is written Psalm.xviij. unto the holy man thou shall be holy /
and with the innocent shall thou deal innocentlye with the pure and chosen
shall thou do purelye / and with the wyked shall thou play ouerth warte: I am
very desirous that al men were saved and that they should com^ unto the
knowledge of the truth: which thing were very necessary for them and also for
my profit / for by their prayers exhortacyons / and examples I might rise from
this filthye sin / and be provoked daily to proceed unto better. I beseech
the therefore oh Lord although I be a sinner / that thou of thy favorable
benevolence would deal gentlye with zion: that the walls of Jerusalem
might be bylt again / zion is thy church / for zyon by interpretacion
signifies a footehill or a place where a man may se far about him:

And even so thy church through the grace of the holy ghost beholds a far
off the glory of God according to the capacite of this lift / and therefore
said the Apostle.ij. Corinth.iij. all we with an uncovered face beholdynge as
in a glass the glory of the Lord / after the same image are transformed from
glory to glory as by the sprete of the Lord.

Lord god how small is thy church at this day? almost the hole world is fallen
from the there are many mo myscreauntes then christen. And yet emonge the
christen how many are there which forsake worldly things and seek the glory
of the Lord. Surulye ye shall find few / in comparyson of them which are
addicte to wordlye things whose god is their belie and glory to their shame
and confusyon / Deal gentlye Lord of thy favorable benevolence with zyon
that it may be increased both in multitude and in good living. Behold from
heaven and deal gentlye as thou art wont to do that thou will send emonge us
the fire of thy cheryte / which may consume all our suns. Deal Lord
according to thy favorable benevolence / and do not with us after our
deserving / nether yield thou us again according to our iniquytyes but
order us according to thy great mercy. Thou art Lord our father and
redemer / thou art our hope / and everlasting health. Every man desires
goodness of he / if thou give it them / then shall they gather it: if thou open
thy hand all shall be filled with plentye / when thou turnest away thy face /
then are they asto^nyed: when thou gatherest in their breath then are they deed
and return in to earth. And again when thou brethest on them / then are they
created a new: and thus renuest thou the face of the earth Psalm.ciiij. Lord I
pray the whate profit is there in the damnacyon of so many thousand men?
Hell is filled and thy church does daily decrease Arise Lord / why slepest
thou so long, Arise / and differe not unto the end / Deal gentlye of thy
favorable benevolence with zyon / that the walls of Jerusalem may be
builded again / what is Jerusalem (which by interpretacyon signifies the
vysion of peace) but the holy congregation and city of the blessed which is
our mother? Her walls were decayed when Lucifer with his angels fell / in to
whose places are the rightwyse men received. Deal therefore gentlye (oh Lord)
with zyon / that he number of thy chosen may shortly be fulfilled / and that
the walls of Hyerusale^ may be edefyed and finyshed with new stones which
shall ever praise the and endure euerlastinglye.

Then shall thou accept the sacrifice of ryghtwysnes / obsaeions and burnt
offeringes: them shall they lay upon thine altar wanton casues.
When thou have dealt gentlye of thy favorable will and benevolence with zyon /
then shall thou accept the sacrifice of rightwisnes / for thou shall consume
it with burninge fire of thy love and cheryte / and so acceptedst thou the
sacryfyces of Moses and Helias. And then acceptest thou the sacrifyces of
rightwysnes / when thou fattenest with thy grace the souls which endeavor
them selves to live ryghtwyslye / what profits to offer sacrifices unto the
when thou acceptest the^ not oh Lord? How many sacryfices offer we now a days
which are not pleasant unto the but rather abominable? for we offer not the
sacrifices of right wysnes / but our own ceremonies: and therefore are they
not accepted. Where is now the glory of the Apostlee? where is the valyaunte
perseueraunce of martyrs? where is the fruit of preachers? where is that holy
simplycyte of them that used to live solitarye? where are the virtues and
works of the Christen which were in old time? Then shall thou accept their
sacrifyces / when thou shall deck and garnish them with thy grace and virtues

Also if thou deal gentlye with zyon of thy favorable beneuole^ce / then
shall thou delight in sacrifices of ryghtwysnes / for the people shall begin
to live well / to keep thy commandments and to deal iustlye and so shall
thy people be endued with thy benefyted and blessinge. The^ shall the oblacious
of the preastes and of the clergy be acceptable unto the / for they shall
forsake their carnal affection and endeavor the^ selves unto a more perfeyte
liffe / and so shall the oyntme^t of thy blyssinge descend upon their heddes.
Then shall the burnt offerynges of the relygious be pleasant to the / for they
shall cast out all drousye sluggeshnes and false confidence / and be hoellye
enflamed and made perfayte with the burninge fire of gods love. The^ shall
the bisshoppes and preachers put calves upon thine altar / for after they are
consummate in all kind of virtue and replenysshed with thy holy sprete / they
shall not fear to give their lives for their sheep what is thine altar sweet
Jesus but thy cross where upon thou wast offered? what sygnifyeth a wanton
calfe / but our body. Therefore the^ shall they put calves on thine altar /
when they shall offer their own bodies unto the cross / that is unto all
afflictions and eue^ unto the very deeth for thy names sake.

Then shall the church flourish and dilate her coostes / then shall thy praise
be noysed from the last end of the world / then shall joy / and gladness
fulfill the hole world.

Then shall thy saints rejoice in glory and shall make mirth in their
ma^cio^s waytinge for us in the loud of the living. Accomplish in me eue^ now
Lord that the^ / which I so often name / that thou may have compassion on me
according to thy great mercy / that thou may receive me for aburnt
sacrifice of rightwisnes for a holy oblacio^ for a sacrifice of good lyuinge /
and for a calfe to be offered on thine altar or cross / by the which I may
pass from thy vale of miserye unto that joy which thou have prepared for them
that love the. Amen.

To fill up the leffe we have touched certain places which we thou most
necessary to edefie the congregation of Christ.

Of faith.
FIrst dear brethren ye ought to give diligent head that you may purelye
understand what faith is and what fruits proceed out of her / And to conclude
the sum in few words / faith is a sure persuasyon and full knowledge that
God for his truth and ryghtwysnes sake will fulfill such promyses / as he has
made unto us of his mercy and sauoure / which sure persuasyon must be given
from god.i. Corin. xij. For it can another be goien by man's power / nether yet
retained. Therefore with fear and tremblinge perform that health which is
bego^ne in you / for it is God that works in you both the will and also the
deed / eue^ at his own pleasure. And se that with all mekenes ye submit
your selves unto the vocacyon of god / not seeking the liberty of the flesh /
nether yet despysinge good works / for faith does mortefye the flesh and her
works / and the sprete of god which rests in a faithful man helps our
infirmitye and sighteth with out intermissyon agenst sin / the deuell and the
world.

The power of faith:
THe power of faith is to iustefye us: that is / to dispoyle us from all our
vices and lay them on Christ's back which has pacefyed the fathers wrath
toward us: and to endne us with a nothers rightwysnes / that is Christ's / so
that I and all my sins are Christ's / and Christ with all his virtues are
mine / for he was borne for us and given unto us. Esaye. ix, Roma. viij. To
obtain this rightwisnes god the father requires nothi^ge of us but that we
believe him and make him no liar. He that believes that God of his mercy has
made us these promises and that for his truths sake he will fulfylle them / he
sets to his seal that god is true. But he that believes not or douteth of
this (as much as in him is) he makes God a liar.i. Joan. v. for why should
thou doubt in him except thou thoughtest that be were a liar and would not
keep his promise which he made? Now if thou count god (which is the very
truth) to be a liar / art thou not worthy a thousand damnacyons?

The work of faith.
Faith works by charity / for when my raginge conscience which fealeth her
sin is pacefyed and set at one with god through faith / then remembrynge the
fervent love of god toward me I can not but love my neighbor again / for
there is no man that hartelye loves the father and can hate the son / and
all though the son be naught and vnthriftye / yet for his fathers sake he
will help to better him and even lament and be sorye for the sons
wykednesse. Likewise if we hartelye love God for his infinite benefytes done
unto us / then can we not hate that creature which he has made after his own
lykenes / whom god the father loves so tenderlye that he gave his own son
unto the deeth to redeem him / ye and whom he has adopted (through Christ) to
be his son and heir. Now all be it we se no kindness in this man for which
we should love him / yet has God showed us kindness enough for the which we
ought to love him and socoure him at all times. Let us therefore love him for
the love that god his creatoure has showed us / and bear his infirmitye if he
faule let us lift him up again / and endue him with our wysdom and all our
works / even as Christ has done with us / and this is an euydent token that
thou love god / when thou love thy brother /.i. Joan.iiij. and seakest all
means / to help him / these are the good works that follow faith / and are
euydent tokens that thy faith is right and pure. Thus see thou how good
works / flow out of faith through cherite. And cherite or love is the
fulfyllinge of the hole law. Roma.xiij.

Good works.
AMong good works the chief are: to be obedyent in all things unto Kings /
Princes / Judges / and soch other officers as far as they command ciuyle
things / that is to say such things as are indifferent / and not contrary
unto the commandments of god / for then must we rather obaye god then men /
Acts in the fyfte chapter although we should lose both our substance and
lyffe thereto: To honor rulers: to promote peace: to pray for all
cominaltyes. And to apply all our studyes to profit them.

The next are: to be obedyent unto father and mother: To provide for our
houscholde both nourishinge our family with bodily sustenaunce / and also to
enstruct them with the word of God / and so to be their gouernoure carnal and
spiritual.

Then must we look how we ought to be have our selfs toward our
neighbors knowleginge that all the gifts which are given us of god / are not
given us for our own self but for the edefyinge of the congregacyon.i.
Corin.xij. and if we bestow them not on that manner we shall surely give a
reckoning for then before the Lord. Emonge these ought we to have respect unto
the preachers and mynistres of the word / that they may be had in honor and
well provided for. And above all things good brethren address your selves
unto that necessary work prayer. Remember to pray for all estates / for that
is a work that Christ and his Apostles full diligently exhorted all men unto
/ promising the^ that they should obtain their peticyons Joan.xviii. Joan.iij.
if they be according to the wist of god and for his glory.i. Joan.v.

Persecutyon.
AFter these and such other works let every man bolden and comfort his
brothern to suffer the cross that god will lay on them to prove them whether
they will abide in his word or fly back again. And let all men cast their
peniworthes before Luc.xiiij. And every day that they are notvexed let them
count that wo^ne / and look every hour when the cross shall come / for this
is a plain case / God scourges every son whom he receaueth. Hebre.xij. and
Paul says.ij. Tim. iij. All that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer
persecucyon. Now if they can endure chasteninge and suffer pacyentlye / then
god offers him self unto them as unto sons Hebre.xij. so that they shall be
destitute in no thing / for what can they lack which have god him self?
Forgive hartelye your enemies and persecutours prayenge unto god for them that
he would vouchsaffe to open their blind hearts and give the^ true knowledge for
there is no man so mad / cruel / furyous / and induratte / but that all
other of them selves are even as were wide from god as he / so that every man
which is not so wyked / may thank god that he keeps him from that impyetye /
thou see a man that is a these a whotemo^gre / and a murtherar: there see
thou even thine own nature for if god kept the not out of such vices / thou
should be even as evil as be / if thou be not such glory in god and not in
thy self. Be not angrye therefore with thine enemies and persecutours / but the
sorye for them and lament their blind ignorau^cie? Receive the cross gladly
and rejoice there in / for this fire and tribulacyo^ (which is the tryinge of
your faith) brings for pacyence / pacyence brings fealinge / fealynge
brings hope / and hope makes us not ashamed Roma. v. But makes us boldly to
look for his judgment / in which the unfaithful shall not be able to stand.
