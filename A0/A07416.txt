A Proper New balad of the Bryber Geheste. Taken out of the fourth book of
Kings the.v. Chapter.
To the tune of King Solomon.
WAs not the Bryber Gehezie
Rewarded justly of the Lord,
Which for example verelie,
The holy Scripture does record
If this be true, as true it was,
Of his reward:
Why should not christan men alas,
Than have regard.
When that the Prophet Elizae
Had cleansed from the Leprosy,
Naaman of Assiria,
Through the works of God on hye:
Then Naaman would him constrame
To take reward:
But Elizae from that refrainde,
And had regard.
But Gehezie of falsehed mind,
When Naaman did pass away.
Did hie him fast that was behind,
And unto Naaman did say:
Behold my master has me sent
For a reward,
To Prophets children he is bente
To have regard.
With right good will said Naaman,
Him to reward, and did proceed,
And Gehezie conuaide it then
So preuilie in very deed,
For getting that the Prophet tho,
Of his, reward
Could by the sprite of God it know,
And have regard,
Alas how was thou Gehezie,
Ravished in worldy gaint?
How was thou brought to mizerie,
Of God appointed for thy pain,
And all thy of spring after thee,
For thy reward,
The Lord that hates Briberie,
Has his regard.
Then Gehezie deceitfulie
To fore the Prophet took his way,
Who said to hime, o Gehezie,
Went not my heart with thee I say,
When Naaman from Charret came,
Thee to reward:
And thou have falselie hid the same,
without regard.
(Gehezie) is it now a time
Thy bribes (he said) for to receive?
Behold for this thy wicked crime
That leproseie to thee shall cleave,
The which was upon Naaman,
For thy reward,
And to thy seed thee after than,
To have regard.
Incontinent then Gehezie
Departed from his presence so,
As the Text does verefie,
A Leper white as is the snow,
Example to such bribers all,
To have regard,
With Gehezie at length they shall
Have their reward,
If they do not their faults confess
Detestinge of their Bryberie,
Else God will spy there wickedness
Though they it cloak with Genezie:
And can them pay accordingly,
The like reward,
As he has done to Iehezie,
O have regard.
The Lord he is that same God still
That he was than undoubtedly,
Such Gehezies he punish will,
That Bribes receive so wickedlie,
Though they so preuilie do hide
their false reward.
Yet of the Lord it will be spide,
Who has regard.
O Lord us guide in all our ways
That we may lead our lives a right
to deal with truth at all assaies,
Give unto us thy holy sprite:
And that our Queen and her Council
May have regard,
In this Land Bribers to expel
that take reward.
Finis.
