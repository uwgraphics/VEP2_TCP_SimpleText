THE PREFACE.
THE order of this small Book, and the matters therein contained are as
follows.

FIRST I have placed herein a Calender, wherein I have observed the old
Saynctes days, not of supersticion, as though I thought every of them
mentioned in the said Calender to be a saint (for of some I know the
contrary: Neither if they were all saynctes, do I therefore place them in my
Calender) But because it has been a custom of ancient time to use their
names in signifiynge and making certain the days, times, and terms of the
year, as by the dating of diverse old Deeds, Evidences, and Records it will
apere. And because the same custom is yet retained in the retorning of writtes
and processes, and also is commonly used in the notinge and setting forth of
the principal Faires and Markettes and other seasons of the year those names
serve well for my purpose, and therefore I might not conveniently have left
them out. And unto the said Calender I have added the Calendes, Nonas, and
Ides, because diverse evidences are dated on those days and by those words.
And thereunto also I have added the vigiles and festival days, with the true
time of the Terms and their returns, because that having this book, there
shall be no occasion to call for any other Calender.

And finally in the end of the said Calender, I have set forth an Almanacke
for lx. years yet to come, wherein is showed the first Sunday in Lent, Caster
day, Rogacion weke, and Whitsonday, and by them you may find al other moveable
feasts.

NEXT AFTER the Almanacke is a Table or Rondell that teaches for ever readely
to find the years of our Lord, the Epact, the Pryme, the Dominicall letter and
the Leap year, with a declaracion of the use of the same Table.

AND also a rule to know the age of the Moon, her Change, and Full for ever.
Then follows a Table to find the feasts of Easter, and so all other the
moveable feasts that have been in time past, or shall be hereafter for ever,
with a plain instruction of the use and understanding thereof.

THEN begins my Computacion of years, wherein is to be noted, that every page
thereof is divided into eyghte several parts or places, as may appear by the
tytles over every of their heads. In the first place are the years of our
lord. In the second the Pryme: In the third, the Epact: In the fourth, the
Dominicall letter: In the fifthe, the leap year, when so ever it happens: In
the sixte, are the names of the kings as they reigned, beginning with William
the Conqueror. etc. And in the same place also are the Months that every of
them entered into their reigns. And in the seventh, are the days of the
Months that every of them began to reign in. And in the.viij. and last, are
the years that every of them reigned.

Also in the end of the reign of every king I have showed the day of his
death if he died being king, or the day of his deposicion if he were deposed,
with a true account how many years, Months, weeks or days he reigned.

AND HERE I think it mete to declare somewhat of the commodity and
necessary use of the Computacion before mentioned. And for the better
instruction and understanding thereof I will move certain questions, and give
aunsweres to the same, in such sort as shall so utter the order and manner
thereof (as it were by examples) that I doubt not, but the true and necessary
use of the same, shall plainly appear to all men.

1. Question.
I would know by this Computacion in the fourth year of king Edward the first,
what was then the year of our Lord, the Prime, the Epact, Dominicall letter,
and the Monthe and day that he began his reign in, and what day in the
week the same was?

Answer.
Among the kings, seek out for king Edward the first, and then look for
the fourth year of his reign, and there it appears to be the year of our
Lord. 1275. The Prime. 3. The Epact. 18. The Dominical letter F. The Monethe
that he began his reign in, November and the. 16. day, which day that year was
Saturday, as is easy to be known if you look in the Cale^der for the.xvj.
day of November, accomptyuge F. for Sunday, then that day must needs be
Saturday, and so of all other the like.

2. Question.
An Evidence dated the. 15. Calendes of December in the.iij. year of king
John, I would know what day of the Monthe the same was, and how long it is
sithen?

Answer.
First look in the Calender in ye Month of November for the Calendes of
Dece^ber, and there you shall find, that the.xv. Calendes of December is on
the.xvij. day of November. Then seek in the Computacion for king John, and
you shall find that the third year of his reign was in the year of our
Lord. 1201. And then set down this year of our lord wherein the question
is asked, which is. 1571. and take out thereof. 1201. and there rests. 370.
And so it must follow that upon the.xvij. day of November next, it shall be
sithen the.iij. year of king John. 370. years, and thus of the like.

3. Question.
An Evidence dated the second Sunday in Lent in the.iiii. year of king
Stephin. I would know in what year of our Lord the same was, and also in what
Monthe, and on what day the second Sunday in Lent was then?

Answer.
First look among the kings for king Stephyn. And when you have found him
then look for the.iiij. year of his reign, and there you shall find the
year of our lord to be. 1138. and the Prime. 18. and B. the Sondaies letter.
Then go to the table that teaches to know Easter day and all the moveable
feasts, which is the next Table before the Computacion.

And there under the title of Prime, seek among those nombers for. 18. And
when you have found it, look downward from the line where the Prime stands,
and seek for the next B. which that year was the Sondaies letter. And when
you have found B. go forward in that line, and there you shall find the.xx.
day of February to be that year the first Sunday in Lent, and thereunto
put.vij. days for one week more, and that shows that the second Sunday in
Lent that year was the 27. day of February. Then set down this present year of
our Lord. 1571. and take out thereof the year of our Lord that was then, which
was. 1138. and there rests. 433. And so it does plainly appear that the. 27.
day of February next coming, it shall be 433. yeres-sithen the.iiii. year of the
reign of king Stephyn. And thus you may do with the like.

4. Question.
I have a lease for.lxxx. years, that began at Mighelmas in the. 17. year of
king Henry the.vij. My desire is to know this present year. 1571. whether my
lease be expired, or how many years I have to com?

Answer.
First in the Computacion look among the kings for king Henry the.vij. and
then for the. 17. year of his reign, which you shall find to be in the year
of our Lord 1501. The which number take out of this present year of our Lord.
1571. and then rests. 70. and so many years of the said lease shall be
expyred at Mighelmas next, and then shall remain. 10. years to come, and so
of the like.

5 An other Question and plain example meet for such as can not extracte one
number out of an other.
A Lease dated the vj. of Iulij, in the. 31. year of the reign of king Henry
the.viij. for the term of xl years that began at our Lady day in Lent then
next folowinge: I would now know whether the said lease be expyred, or how
many years there are to come?

Answer.
First look in the Computacion among the kings for king Henry the.viij. and
for the. 31. year of his reign, which you shall find to be in the year of
our Lord. 1539. Then at the next year folowinge begin to recon, and call that
one, and so tell down in order all the years folowinge, and end with this
present year. 1571, And in the whole, you shall find the number of 32. And so
many years of the said lease shall be expired at our lady day in lent next
coming. And at that time there shall remain to come of the said lease.viij.
years and thus you may account the years of any lease.

6 An other very plain question or example, easy for all men to conceive, and
in this time is commonly used,
A lease dated the 17. day of August, in the v. year of the reign of king
Edward the.vj. for the term of xxj. years, which began at Mighelmas then next
following. I ask the question this xij. day of August 1571. whether the said
lease be expired, or how many years are yet to come?

Answer.
First in the Computacion, among the kings, seek for king Edward the vj. and
for the v. year of his reign, and there you shall find the year of our lord
to be. 1550. Then begin at the next year after, which is 1551. and call that
one, and so tell downwarde all the years to this present year 1571. And in the
whole you shall find. 21. which plainly declares that at Mighelmas next,
the aforesaid term of. 21. years shall be fully expired. And this you may do
in the account of all terms of years.

Note also that in the said Computacion diverse of the kings have in the first
year of their reign no year of our Lord: The cause is, that they began in the
same year that the former king dyed in. And therefore when you tell the
years, do not reckon them that have no year of our Lord,

Note also that the year of our lord after the Computacion of the Church of
England, begins ever the. 25. day of March which is the day of the
Annunciacion of our Lady. And the number of the Epacte begins ever the
first day of March, and the Prime the first day of January.

Note also, that when thou accompteste any term of years, that the same term
that thy lease first began in, must end and fynishe in the last year of thy
reconynge at the self same term. As if thy lease began at Myghelmas for.xxj.
years, then it must end at Mighelmas the same year that the whole.xxj. years
are expired in, and if at Midsomer, then it must end at Midsomer the same
year, as the last question and example does plainly show.

And this I trust may suffyce for the instruction of the use, order, and
commodytie of the said Computacion.

Then follows.iiij. Tables that teach for ever to know in most Ports and
Havens of this Realm: when it is full Sea, with a plain declaracio^ of the
said tables.

And finally one other Table, showing for ever what sign the Moon is and shall
be in every day, and declares also what days are good to let Blood, Pourge,
or Bathe. etc.

And hereunto I have added the Month, day, and place, of all the Faires kept
in England, set forth in a more orderly manner then heretofore has been.

And finally, in the later end hereof is set out the ways (in a larger manner
then before they have been) as well how a man may travel from any notable
town in England, to the City of London, as from London to any notable town,
or from one notable town to an other in the most parts of this Realm: So that
herein are contained the chief and most necessary things that pertain to any
man's travel.

In this Calender you shall often times find these letters B. and E. The which
signify such days as the Egypcians note to be dangerous to begin or take any
thing in hand, as to take a Journey or any such thing.

A Table, wherein thou may readely find the Epact, the Prime, or Golden
nombre, the Dominicall Letter, and the Leap year for ever.


A declaracion of this Rundell and Circles in the same,
FIRST NOTE that in the foresaid Rundell are v. Circles, and in the uppermost
Circle are placed the years of our Lord, the which you must first look
for, before you seek for any of the other matters. After you have found the
year of our Lord, then in the next Circle under that, is the Epact of that
year, and the Circle next under that, is the Pryme or Golden number of that
year. And in the next Circle under that, is the Dominicall letter of that year.
And if it be leap year, then the same stands right under the Dominicall
letter in the nethermost Circle.

The Epact.
AND HERE note, that the Epact keeps continually a course of.xxx. years, by
putting to every year.xj. and taking away ever the number of xxx. and what
soever remains more then xxx. the same is the Epact for that year: As for
example, the Epact this present year of our Lord. 1571. is 4. And the next
year, that is to say the first day of March, for ever the number of the Epact
changes the first day of March. And then I put.xj. to my. 4. that was this
year, and that makes.xv. which shall be the Epact the first day of March
next coming, and so shall continue all that year until March come again, and
then put a xj. more to the number that was before, and it shall be xxvj. which
likewise shall continue al yt year until March following, and then put to xxvj.
a xj. more, and that makes xxvij: which number of xxx. you must put away, and
then rests vij. for the Epact of that year. And when soever the number of the
Epact is full xxx. then is there no Epact that year.

ALSO NOTE, as I said before, that the course of the Epact continues 30. year,
and the very same number that is the Epact this year, shall be the Epact again
xxx. years hence, as thou may easily perceive by the aforesaid Circle, which
sets out the whole course of the Epact for 30. year, and then begins
again as it began before, and so it is a perfect number for ever.

The Prime or Golden number.
THE Prime is a number that begins with one, and yearly increaceth one,
until it come to the number of.xix. and then it begins again one. etc. So
that every.xix. year is the whole course of the Prime or Golden number for ever.

The Dominicall letter.
THE Dominicall or Sondayes letter keeps his course. 28. year, And the same
letter that is Sondayes letter this year, shall be the Sondaies letter. 28. year
hence. And so have you the rule to find the Sondaies letter for ever.

The Leap year.
THE leap year as you may perceive by the former and nethermost Circle
chances every iiij. year. And ever when thou may divide the year of our
Lord even in iiij. parts, then is it leap year. And thus you have a full
and perfect declaracion of the former rundell, and the Circles therein
contained.

A Rule to know at all times the Age of the Moon, her change and full.
IF YOU desire at any time to know how old the Moon is. First consider what
day of the Month it is that you would know the age of the Moon. And then know
what number the Epact is that year, and put them together, then account how
many Months the same is from the Month of March, and recon March for one,
and then put all together, and se what number that makes. If the number be
more then 30. take out the 30. and look what rests and so many days old
the Moon is: But if it be just 30. then you may be sure that the same day the Moon changed, or was the first day of the Moon. And if the number be less
then. 30. what so ever it be, so many days old is the Moon. And for the
better understanding hereof, I will give you an example or twain.

Example.
I would know the.xv. day of December next coming 1571. how old the Moon
will be. First I have in memory this number.xv. and straight I put thereunto the
number of the Epact this year which is 4. and that makes. 19. then I put so
many Months thereunto as is from March to December and recon March for the
first, and December for the last, and they are x. the which I put to my
aforesaid number 19. which in the whole makes 29. and so many days old shall
the Moon be the 15. day of December next.

ANOTHER example, I would know the 19. day of September next coming 1571. how
old the Moon shall be: First I put in Memory 19. which is the day I ask the
question of, and I put thereunto the Epact of this year which is 4. and that
makes 23. and thereunto I put so many Months as is from March to September
and reken March for one, as I did in the last example, and that is 7.
Months, which nombers being put altogether make. 30. and that day the Moon
changes or is the first day of ye Moan. And thus of al other.

The year when there is no Epact, which as you may perceive by the former Table
chances every xxx. year, then always that year the Moon changes the first
day of March. And all that year you shall reken for the age of the Moon the
day of the Month, and so many Months as is from March, and that is the age of
the Moon for that year.

Now when you know the change of the Moon, put thereunto. 7. and there
begins the first quarter, and the. 15. day is full Moan, and. 7. days more
begins the last quarter. And thus ye may readely and quickelye reken upon
your fingers, and find the new Moan, full Moan, and the age of the Moon at
any time for ever.

And when you have the former rule in perfect memory, then may you at any
time, tell when it is full sea, or low water, namely here in the river of
Thames at London bridge, as thus. Know for a certainty that every change of
the Moon, and every full Moan makes a high water or full sea at London Bridge
at iij. of the clock either in the morning or at after none, and then may you
reken so many days from the change to the full Moan which is. 15. days, and
account the tide to encreace every day one hour, which is xv. hours, and
then abate xv quarters, for in a day are two tides, a flood and an Ebb, and
they both alter scant iij. quarters of an hour, except storms and tempests
cause the contrary, and so you may from day to day where so ever you are,
know the certeintie of the tide at London Bridge. And the better to lead you
unto the understanding hereof, take this example.

I would know the xij. of September next 1571. at what time it shall be high
water at London Bridge. First I resort to my former rule, and search how many
days old the Moon will be that day, and I find that the Moon shall be 23.
days old, and then I consider that the 15. day, which day the Moon was at
the full, it was high water at 3. of the clock, then for viij. days more, I
add for every day three quarters of an hour, and that is vj hours, which I
put to 3. of the clock, and that makes 9. of the clock, at which hour shall be
a high water, and then tell from ix. of the clock, vij. hours more, and that
makes iiij. of the clock, and then shall it be a dead low water, and thus of
all other for ever.

On the other side of this leaf follows a Table, which shows how you may
readely find Easter and all other moveable feasts of the year for ever, as
well for times past, as for the times to come.

A descripcion of the order and use of the aforesaid Table as follows.
FIrst note, that the said Table is divided into six parts or places. In the
first is the Prime, in the second, the Dominical letter, in the third, the
first So^day in Lent, in the fourth Easter day, in the fifth, Rogacion week,
and in the sixte Whitsondaye.

And for the better understanding of the use thereof, ye must always when you
desire to know the time of any of the said Feasts, first consider what year
of the Lord it is that you would know them in, and then look what was or is
the Prime of that year, and the Dominical letter, and those may you easily
find and learn in the little roundeale, that is before set forth. And when
you know the Prime, and Sondayes letter, the^ come to this Table, and it will
easily show you your desire.

Example.
I would know in ye year of our Lord 1574. when shall be the first Sunday
in Lent, Easter day, etc.

First I go to the roundeale aforesaid, and there in the uppermost Circle, I
seek out the year of our Lord 1574. and in the second Circle directly under
that, there I find that year the Prime to be 17. and under that, the
Dominicall letter to be C. Then I come to the above said Table, and first
under the title of Prime I seek for the nombre of 17. and when I have found
the same, then I look downward among the Sondayes letters for the next C that
is after the Prime, for that is the Sondayes Letter for that year, and when I
have found C. I go forward in that line where C stands, And first I find
that the 28. day of February that year, shall be the first Sunday in Lent, the
11. day of April, Easter day, the 16. day of May, Rogacion weke, and the
30. day of May Whitsonday. And thus may you do with all other, both for time
paste, and time to come, for ever.

NOTE ALSO that this Table in the beginning shows the lowest Monethe and
day in the year, that Easter, and all other moveable feasts do fall in. And
in the end, it shows the highest Monethe and day that Easter, and the
moveable feasts do ascend unto. So may it be truly said, that it is a
perfect table.

And yet hereunto will I add one rule, which though it be in old and rude
meter, yet is it worthy of memory, and it is the same rule, whereby this Table
was made, which is this.

In March after the first C.
look the Prime where ever it be.
The third Sunday after, Easter day shall be.
And if the Prime on the Sunday be.
Then reckon that for one of the three.

A declaracion of the Tables, last before moncioned.
IF YOU be desirous at any time to know when it is a full Sea or high water
at any Port or Haven in England Wales, or Ireland, or in any other part of ye
world. If first by your own knowledge, or the knowledge of any expert
maryner, you know when you se the Moon in such a part of the firmament, that
the^ it is full sea at such a port or haven. Then these Tables shall be nedeles
for you. But if you can not so do, and would learn, then resort to these
Tables, and first consider with your self how many days old the Moon is
the day that you desire to know the tide. And in the myddle of the said
tables, you shall find in the uppermost part of them, this title. The age of
the Moon. And right against the day of the age of the Moon, you shall find
on both sides, the places and points of the firmament, as South, South and by
West, and South Southe West. etc.

And next under that line, are these letters H. M. which signify Hours and
Mynutes. Then having in memory the age of the Moon, as aforsaide, go directly
to the title of that place of the firmament, to the which when the Moon
comes makes a high water, and there you shall find the Hour and Mynute
when it is full Sea in that place.

Example.
I would know at what hour it will be a full Sea or high water at London
Bridge the xx. day of December next, being in the year of our Lord 1571.

Answer.
sp FIRST resort to the former Table that teaches you to know the age of the
Moon at all times, and by that rule you shall find, that the xx. day of
December next, the Moon shall be iiij. days old. Then look upon the titles
in the uppermost part of the aforesaid Tables, and among them you shall
find London. And directely in the line next under the same, you shall find
Southwest, the which declares that when the Moon is in the Southwest, that
then it is full sea at London Bridge. Then go down the line of the age of the
Moon, until you come at the iiij. day, and there you shall find on the left
hand of the same, directely under the line where Southwest stands these
figures 6. 12. which is vj. of the clock and xij. mynutes, at which time the
aforesaid 20. day of December next shall be high water at London Bridge.

And in the uppermost part of the aforesaid Tables, I have written the names
of some Ports, at which time the Moon coming to that place causes a full
Sea, and unto them ye may add such other as you have, or shall have knowledge
of.

A Table shewinge what Sign the Moon is in, and shall be for ever, and
showing also the times good to let Blood, to Purge, and to Bathe.

A declaracion of the Table, that is on the other side, showing at all times
what sign the Moon is in.
First, for the better understanding thereof: Note that it is divided into
vij. titles, that is to say, into Months, Days, Prime, Signs, to let
blood, purge and to bathe. Now if you will know at any time what sign the Moon is in, you must first seek out in the said Table among the months, for the
month wherein you desire to be certified, and likewise, among the title of
days, for the day of yt month that you desire, and when you have found them,
then begin at the month and tell the same for one day, and so go forth until
you come to the number of yt days that you would have, and note well what
day the same does end upon, and keep it in your memory. Then seek for ye
Prime of that year among the title of Primes, and accomptyng the Prime for one,
tell so many days as before you commit ted to memory, and then on the right
hand you shall find what sign the Moon is in, and what days are good to let
blood, to purge, and to bathe, which are noted with these ij. letters, G for
good, and B for bad, and where there is no Letter, there the sign is
indifferent.

Example.
I WOVLDE know the 12 day of November next, in this present year of our
Lord. 1571, what sign the Moon will be in. First I look in the aforesaid
Table, among the title of the Months, and there I find November together
with Februarij placed against the figure. 1. which is in the title of days,
and there I begin to reckon and call the figure of 1. one, and so tell
downwarde until I come to 12. and I find that the same ends upon 12. which
nombre I keep in memory. Then I seek for the Prime of this year, which is. 4.
among the title of Primes, and on the left side thereof stands 11. and there I
begin again, and call that 11. one, and so go downewarde, till I come to the
number which I had kept in memory, which was 12. and on the right side
thereof I find the sign to be Capricorn, naught to let Blood, to Pourge, or
to Bathe. And thus of all other.
