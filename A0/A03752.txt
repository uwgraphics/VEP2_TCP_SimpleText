DENDPOLOGIA. DODONA'S GROVE, OR, THE VOCAL FOREST.

By I. H. ESQr.

By T.B. for H. Mosley at the Princes Arms in St Paul's Churchyard. 1640

To the Common Reader.
OPinion, is that high and mighty Dame,
Which rules the World, and in the Mind does frame
Distaste or liking; for in humane race,
She makes the fancy various as the face.
Sometimes the Father differ's from the Son,
As does the Gospel from the Alcharon!
Or Loyola from Calvin, which two brands,
In strange Combustions hurl fair Europe's Lands:
So that amongst such Atoms of mankind,
You scarce can two encounter of one mind.
This makes my Trees all Aspen, 'cause they must
Lie open to every Wind, and vulgar gust:
Yet much they fear not any Critickes knockes,
Unless they chance to stumble amongst the blocks.
-- Ex quovis stipite non fit Mercurius.
To the Critical READER.
IF Satyrs here you find, think it not strange,
It Is proper Satyrs in the Woods should range;
And for free speech, why may not Verse or Prose
Sit under Trees as safely, as the Rose?
Yet here is nothing, though a Grand Inquest
You should empannell, but may bide the Test:
For petty Iuries, let the Reader know,
Composures of this kind stoop not so low.
To the rarely accomplishd, and worthy of best employment, Master HOVVEL, upon
his Vocal FOREST.
Believe it, Sir, you happily have hit
Upon a curious Fancy, of such wit,
That far transcends the vulgar; for each Line,
Me thinks, breathes BARCLAY, or a BOCCOLINE.
I know you might (none better) make the Vine,
The Olive, Ivy, Mulbery, and Pine,
With others, their own Dialects expose,
But you have taught them all rich English Prose.
I end and envy, but must justly say,
Who makes Trees speak so well, deserves the Bay.
Henry Wotton.

On the Vocal Forest, to I. H. Esquire.
COme THEOPHRASTUS, and resign thy Pen,
Thy Trees are taught to speak, they are grown to Men:
Men were transformd to Trees, and some are still
Mere Blocks; but MERCURY now proves his skill,
And charms the Grove; the wagging leaves first mutter,
At'he change, and straight State-Language they do utter.
The pleasant Arbor gently whispers This,
Trees have their Keys, as well as ARGENIS.
Hedges have ears, the rural Proverb says,
Court-Proverb tells, they have toungs, and toungs of Bays.
'Twas IOTHANS style, to wrap in toungs of Trees,
As sacred Rolls report, State-Mysteries.
No Poplar here, no Medlar succor finds,
True-heart of Oak, the loyal Author minds*
Spring stately Grove, be thousand Winters green,
And in thy Rind be names of Princes seen:
Though VULCAN Iron-marks, our Forests bear,
Nor Axe, nor Fire APOLLO'S Grove does fear.
T. P. S. T. D.

DODONA'S GROVE. OR, THE VOCAL FOREST.
IT fortuned not long since, that Trees did speak, and locally move, and meet
one another; Their ayrie whistlings, and soft hollow whispers became
Articulate sounds, mutually intelligible, as if to the soul of vegetation, the
sensitive faculties and powers of the intellect also, had been co-infus'd into
them: They traveld to strange Countries, crossd Seas, made peace and war,
alliances and leagues, assumed names and Characters of distinction, and
discharged all the functions of Rational creatures.

In the sacred Oracles we read of one that discernd men to walk like Trees,
but here clean contrary, you shall see Trees walk like men. We read also
there of a mighty Monarck, that was meant by a Tree; And it is no new Character
of man, that, He is a Tree reversed.

The great Sicilian Antiquary leaves upon record, that in the nonage of the
world, men's voices were indistinct and confused; And sojourning chiefly in
VVoods, by a kind of assimilation and frequent impressions in the ear, they
resembled those soft susurrations of the Trees wherewith they conversd; until
Time, (which ripeneth) and Art which perfecteth all things, and has a greater
interest in speech then Nature her self, did distinguish these misshapen sounds
into syllables, and so by degrees into language.

At that time, when this parley of Trees begun, I my self was but a little,
little Plant newly sprung up above ground; And passing through the terrible
Birch to Boetia, where I took in my best Sap, and came by degrees to a
consistent growth (which was not very high, in so much that some think I was
set in the wane of the Moon) I was transplanted from Boetia to Tamisond, And
thence as my Genius strongly led me, I often crossed the Seas, and rangd up and
down through most of the Forests of the lower world; And as I passed along, I
observed the motions, and studied the properties of sundry sorts of Trees, as
well foreign, as home sprung, and of them I intend to relate some passages; In
the narration whereof I will endeavor to go between the Bark and the Tree, as
near as possibly I can with safety, to sift out, and set down the truth of
things, for the prime virtue of story is verity.

Wherefore I hope to obtain a candid construction of this rough hewn, ill
timberd discourse, and that the Reader will be pleased as he shall pass along
through these woods, to afford me sometimes his second thoughts, and observe
also the constant vein of impartiality, which runs through the whole work,
which he shall find to be such, that it will infranchise his judgment
everywhere: And such, I know will dispense with my errors and slips, for it is
very hard but one passing through so many Forests as I intend, may meet with
some stumbling blocks in his way.

(...). -- Sacra Jovi Quercus. A Character of DRVINA.
THere is a goodly Forest, Druina by name, anciently called the White Forest,
wherein the royal Oak rules in chief, and with such a latitude of power, that
He stretches forth his branches to the Sea, and his boughs unto the great
Rivers. It was ordained by Heaven, that She should be principally protected by
Neptune, who with a flying guard of brave winged Coursers does engarrison her so
strongly, that, lying safe in his bosom, she may be said to be -- Media
insuperabilis Vnda. She being endowed with those two properties which that
great Register of natures secrets requires in an invincible Country, viz. A
secure and easy going out for the Native, and a doubtful hard coming in for
the stranger; which made the Caerulean God so indulgent of his Druina, and to
repose in her such a rare confidence, that besides the clustre of Diadems which
begirt her high fronded forehead by land, he transmitted to her long since his
very Trident, making her Impresse, yea, Empress of the Sea, and that in so
high a degree of Sovereignty, that in her own waves, he gave her an Exclusive
propriety; in so much that the utmost extent of her desmenes royal, are
adjudged, by some great Clerks, to be the shoares of the neighboring
Forests.

Whereby she is grown so famous through all the inhabited earth, and
formidable to the next adjacent regions, that maugre all their menaces,
pretensions, and practices, she gives them the law upon salt water; which makes
her a terror to her foes, a shelter to her friends, and security to her
neighbors; But above all, she has thereby a constant strength to defend her
self: And self defense has been always held the first maxim of policy.

Much more might be spoken in honor of Druina, which I suspend, until I have
made you acquainted with some of her neighboring Forests, because I am to
make often transcursions into them as I pass along; And first of her next
opposite neighbor Ampelona, where the Majesticke Vine does monarchize in the
highest degree of Sovereignty.

A CHARACTER OF AMPELONA.
Rode Caper vitem; tamen hic, cum stabis ad aras,
In tua quod fundi cornua possit, erit.
ANd now I am upon a piece of the Continent and one of natures best pieces, one
of her chiefest Granaries and Winecellars; a square of 550. miles travers, take
the diameter where you will, thronging with such multitudes of sappy and
spritefull plants, that the general calcule which was made in the last
perambulation exceeded eight millions; a rare soil that in no larger a
circumference, can give radical moisture to such a number without borrowing of
any; Corn, Wine, and Salt, her three rich staples do so abound in her, that
she seasoneth, and keeps from starving very many of her neighbors, but
specially the Forest of the South, which otherwise would perish for the staff
of life.

There is no Region on Earth so daintily watered, with such great navigable
Rivers, whereof some are said to be paved with Troutes, borderd with crevices,
and imbroderd with Swannes; And upon these multitudes of brave Cities stand,
and all her great ones stand so; but amongst them the midland towns are most
flourishing and abounding in wealth, which shows that her riches are interne
and domesticke; For as it is the mark of a good housewife to be more Vendax,
then Emax, rather a seller then Buyer, so is it of a good Country; And such a
one is Ampelona, which sends forth far more, then she fetches in. The Warlike
Vine swayeth here in the most absolute form of supremacy that may be, for He
not only makes Peace and War, summons and dissolves general meetings,
pardons, naturallizeth, ennobleth, stamps, and lays value upon coins, but
also enacts laws, executes justice, and lays impositions at pleasure; and He
may thank Druina for this boundless power, for when she by the strength of
her horned Yew had feld down a great number of the strongest Trees that were
in Ampelona, and made such firm invasions into her very bowels, that there
could be no universal assembly, the necessity of the times cast the power of
the three estates upon the Vine himself, that his mandats should stand for
laws, whereby he laid what taxes, and made what leavies he pleased; His
successors made virtue of this necessity, which though temporary at first,
continues ever since; For sovereignty where she gets an inch, sticks not
sometimes to stretch it to an ell. But that which made it more passable was,
that the burden lighted chiefly upon the poor coppices and Underwoods; so
that ever since, the Vine himself with the taller sorts of Trees, specially
the holy Yews (who ingrosse more than all the rest, and are thought by
computation to have the third part of the Forest,) suck all the sap, and
leave the poor shrubs to dry up, fade away, and wither; and when they have got
any moisture, they serve but as spunges for others: Out of which disproportion
arises this inconvenience, that they become pusillanimous, and almost useless
for military services, being so often peeld, that they never come to be perfect
and firm timber.

It is always a mixd government twixt Peace and War, which finds perpetual
employment for many of her stirring spirits, having the advantage thereby to
be furnished upon all occasions with experienced martial instruments; for
Ampelona having open frontires contiguous every where with some Alien, She
cannot join Peace and security together, nor fetch a sound sleep, but
Hercules-like with clubbe in hand. She is the greatest one knot of strength in
the Western world, and for the situation fittest to disjoyne or unite her
neighbors forces, and consequently to be Arbitratrix and compoundresse of any
quarrel that may intervene: And never, since she woare the Imperial diadem,
was Ampelona so potent, nor then, so well knit and compacted as now she is; so
that it is held a maxim, If Ampelona combat not her self, she is invincible;
And this she has too often done, turning the sword of civil broils into her
own bowels, so far that the bell has often told, but never yet rung quite
out for her liberty, which was thought not long since to be upon point of
expiring; and no wonder, sheabounds so with quick sets and wildings, and a
world of boiling volatile spirits, impatient of peace any longer then they are
recovering the ruins of war; present danger magnanimats them, and inflames
their courage, but expectation makes it languish; so that the Forest of the
South (which is ever emulous of Ampelona) compares their valor to a squib, or
fire of flax, which burns and crackles for the time, but suddenly
extinguisheth; Indeed fury when the first blast is spent turns commonly to
fear, and they that are possessed therewith may be said to be like the month
of March, which enters like a Lion, but goes out like a Lamb.

Ampelona is one of the chiefest climes of complement and courtship under
heaven, which puts so large a distance twixt the tongue and the heart, that
they are seldom relatists. Most of her Plants have the Heliotropian quality of
the Marigold and Tulip, who follow the motion of the Sun opening and shutting
with him; The fancy predominates more than the judgment, but they in whom both
these concur are admirable, as there is amongst them at present a notable
example, which serves for a mighty proppe to the Vine, and it is well known no
Tree needs props more. For friendship, love commonly flames there, before it
burns, and so cannot be long lasting, for though first affection makes
deepest impression, yet that love is held most permanent, which dives into the
soul by soft degrees of mutual society, and is matur'd by time; very acute
they are, and cautelous in treating, and therein have proved (more than once)
too hard, for plain down right dealing Druina; finally some say, one shall best
discern an Ampelonian, and most to his advantage, if one look upon him, as we
use to do upon scarlet (his prime color) the dye whereof is better discernd
by quick glances, and a passing eye, then by a fixd.

I write not this to derogat from noble Ampelona, for I honor her in a most
high degree, having practically found her better sort of Trees though allowed
their fancies, (and that they participate somewhat with the Cork, and are
subject to be shaken with incertaine winds) to be the most generous, daring and
ventrous spirits, and fullest of resolution and metal for their Country and
honor, of any upon the surface of the earth, and what was said before must be
understood, as the Philosophers use to restrain many propositions in their
Schools, Non de singulis generum, sed de generibus singulorum: No where are
there more quick inventive and penetrating capacities, fraught with all kind
of scientifiall knowledge; Not any are more generally imitated for fashion,
comportment and garb, which many of her neighbors do follow to a forced kind
of affectation, thinking they are not refined till then; not any have more of
the Cavalier then they, the Levant parts ring more of them, and their martial
achievements then of any other Nation.

But I have sojourned too long in Ampelona, I will now cross the Hills to
Elaiana, whence if a meridian wind blows, I am sure to know when I am near
her, by those sweet fragrant odours she casts from her very shrubbes, for the
brute animals there make themselves beds of Rose-mary and Thyme.

But strange it is, and indeed very strange to me, that there being but a hill,
yea a small bridge of partition twixt Ampelona, and Elaiana, there should be
such an antipatheticall and quite differing genius in their plants; I know,
Nature delights, and triumphs in dissimilitudes, but here she seems to have
industriously studied it: The nature of the one is debonnaire and aco'stable;
of the other retird and supercilious: The one quick and spritefull; The other
slow and saturnine; The one bushy and tufted on the top; The other lop'd short:
The one delights in a close thick rind; The other goes thin and scarified; The
one gay underneath, the other without, which makes some of them to be compared
to the Cinnamon Tree, whose Rind is more worth than the body; The one takes the
ball before the bound; The other stays for it, and commonly fetches a surer
stroke; The one in the carriage of his designs is like the Wind, the other
like the Sun in the fable, when they went to try their strength upon a
passengers cloak The one knows how to shuffle the Cards better; the other
plays his game more cunningly; The one disgests all he swallows; The other
is subject to cast it up again; The one contracts and enchaines his words
speaking pressingly and short; The other delights in long breathd accents,
which he prolates with such pauses, that before he be at a period of his
sentence, one may reach a second thought.

In fine Saturn swayeth over the one, and Mercury over the other, with whom
the Moon also has a great stroke, so that some think the bush which the man
in the Moon carries on his back, did grow first in Ampelona, and that the
wheel of fortune was made of a piece of her timber; Out of these various
premises you may infer that there is a political, moral and natural
opposition and difference twixt these so near neighbors; both in their
comportment, garb, fancy and humor, so far, that one may say, what the one
is not, the other is* insomuch that if you would fetch one from the remotest
parts the Sun displayes his beams upon, yea from the very Antipodes; he will
agree with either, better then they one with another; yet they both symbolize
in this, that they love to look upon themselves through multiplying glasses,
and the bigger end of the prospectife. But I must hasten to Elaiana.

A CHARACTER OF ELAIANA.
AND now I am come from Gods blessing to the warm Sun, who is a little too
prodigal of his beams here, which makes the soil less fruitful, and to be
a kind of wilderness in comparison of Ampelona, being like a Libbards skin,
here a spot, and there a spot inhabited; she swells so every where with huge
hills; And some would make a question whether the minds of the Inhabitants or
her mountains be highest; the tops whereof by reason of the tenuity and
clearenesse of air, (for sometimes you shall not see in the whole hemisphere
from morning to night as much cloud as would line a Monmoth Cappe) you may
discern above two hundred Miles off, and some of them periwigd with snowes all
the year long, And on some, one shall find more difference in point of temper
of air, twixt bottom and top, then twixt Summer and Winter in other places;
But where Elaiana has valleys, there she is deliciously fertile, such
blessings humility carries always with her; Her rivers having for the most
part high banks, and shallow bottomes, serve not for Navigation, but are
wheeld up into small Cataracts, and so divided into sluices, to humectat the
bordering soil, and make it wonderfully productive: A cheap Country to travel
in, for one will hardly find meat for money, (but sauce good store) the
conveyance of provision being so difficult, yet this scarcity carries with it a
notable advantage for Military uses, wherewith nature seems to recompense her,
for her Plants are the tougher thereby, and can endure more then they that
sprout forth of wanton soft soyles; Moreover her abruptness, barrenes and
heat, carry with them another mighty benefit, for she cannot be so easily
overrunne by foreign force, in regard that besides the difficulty of passage, an
army would either starve for want, or miscarry, for the unusual heat of the
clime, which I believe was the reason, that the Roman Eagles could hardly fly
over her in nine score years, whereas they flew through and through Ampelona
in less then nine.

For the quality every thing she bears is passing good, only she fails in the
quantity, And did she abound in plenty, as she excels in perfection of all
things (by reason of the full concoction the Sun makes) specially had she
Corn proportionable to her greatness, she would prove terrible to all her
neighbors.

The mighty Olive who now swayeth, thrives well, and fructifieth by ingrafting
upon the lovely Ampelonian Vine. He keeps his Court near the very center of
Elaiana, like the Sun in the Heavens, which being in the midst, equally
communicats his beams to all. And a spacious kingdom is like a great Indian
hide, plant your foot on one side or corner, the other will bound up against
you, tread on the middle, all parts will lie flat; so some hold it a maxim in
policy, for the Prince to reside in the very navill of his kingdom, to
encounter all insurrections with the more celerity, that may arise in any other
part. But now me thinks I spy a satyr with a huge bushy head rushing out of
Ampelona, and breaking out into this critical discourse of Elaiana; That the
time was when Elaiana did contain and content her self within the
circumference of her own boundaries, without any further encroachments, but of
late years she has shot up, and spread her branches far and near into all
parts of the habitable earth, whereby she is grown up to so monstrous and
giant-like a proportion, that she is become formidable to all her neighbors,
in such sort, as she puts every one to stand upon his guard, and have a
continual larum-bell in his ears; they stand gazing at her vast bulk, and
wonder when she will leave growing; for in her political designs she differs
from all her Neighbors, in regard that whereas they do only labor and cast
about how to conserve and secure what they have already, and keep the scales
even, her counsels tend still to enlarge and augment her territories. The
discovery of Columbina, I confess, together with the conquest, was a work of
hers; yet it is observed those vast treasures she transports thence thrive
little, in regard of the Ocean of humane, though savage blond, she spilt there;
so that some affirm the blood would overpoise all the gold she had ever
thence, if they were counter-balanc'd; And as that treasure was first got by
such effusions of blood, so the greatest part of it, has been spent ever
since in blood, for most of the broils of the Western world have been fed
and fomented by it.

But that immense tract of earth she holds under that clime, is preserved
rather by the conceit and report of her greatness, then by any intrinsicke
strength: yet I cannot deny but her dominions are very spacious, that the Sun
never forsakes her quite, perpetually shining in some part or other above her
hemisphere: a grandeza, I confess, that none of all the four Monarchies could
vaunt of, no not the Roman, whose greatness was said to have no horison,
though falsely, for he could never cross Ganges, or clime over Caucasus,
Insomuch that Elaiana glories, Apollo only with his chariot can measure the
extent of her territories: And they speak of certain Ambassadors that came
not long since to the now regnant Olive from a Pagan Emperor, upon whose
credentiall letters was endors'd this superscription; To the King who has the
Sun for his helmet.

Public fame has long given out that Elaiana aims at the fifth Monarchy, but
that is a fond conceit of hers and building of Castles in the air; for she
has been told long since by the Oracle, that she shall never attain it,
because all other soyles reject her plants, and fly from under their shadow as
the Serpent from the Ash, who will leap sooner into a fire: in so much that
from those places to which she gives protection, she seldom has any
affection; for the Elaianians are observed to partake of the nature of Oil in
diverse qualities, therefore most properly are they governd by the Olive. First,
Oil is observed to swim still on the top, and the reason the Naturalists
give, is, because air does most predominat in it, so are they lifted up with
an ayrie conceit (for ambition is naught but air) that they are only designed
to be Lords Paramount of the world.

Oil will hardly or never (unless it be well beaten) mingle and incorporat
with any other liquid thing: so they, wheresoever they come, do very hardly
agree, and sympathize with any other Nation. Oil has a dilating quality, that
by soft insensible degrees it spreads and still gains upon the body where it
falls, so they by politic close ways use to eat into, and incroach upon their
neighbors, or more properly for this subject they are like the Tartarian plant
Boraneth, which growing up to the visible form of a LAMB, insensibly eats up
all the grass round about it.

Lastly, Oil is slow, smooth and solid, so are they observed to be in their
motion, though it be a question yet unresolved, whether their affected gravity
and slownes in their negotiations have tended more to their prejudice or
advantage: And they would bring all others, that have to do with them, to
follow their pace, it being one of their maxims, that policy must move after
the motion of Saturn, the highest of the Planets: yet although they are long
in consulting, they are quick and sudden in executing their designs, and
therein are rather of the nature of the Mulberry, which the Arbolists observe,
to be long in begetting and keeping his buds, but the cold seasons being
passed, he shootes them all out in a night.

Another obstacle to Elaiana's, pretended Monarchy may be, that it is observed,
the Sovereign Ministers she employeth abroad in the highest kind of trust, are
so intentive for the improvement of their own fortunes, that it is grown to a
proverb, some of them gnaw, others eat, and some devour in those places,
wherein they are deputed to bear Sovereign sway; Add hereunto that her form
of government is none of the pleasingst, for she chooses to rule rather by
fear than love, And where she gets any love, it is drawn as thread through a
needles eye, out of the apprehensions of fear, it being one of her principles,

That obedience derived from such a love is surest, in reward that fear as the
carefullest and greatest house-wife of our passions, swayeth more powerfully
over all the rest, and keeps them still in centinell, And so makes good
subjects, as it did Gods at first, Primus in orb Deos fecit Timor --

Besides all this, as one has lately observed, Elaiana has been a good while
troubled with a fastidious issue, which she caused to be made at first for a
dizzines in the head that proceeded no doubt from that huge height she is
mounted unto; It was cauterizd at first by Itelia, who fetched her iron from
Druina and Ampelona; at the beginning it purged only the gross humors, but
afterward it exhausted her very radical moisture, (which she suckd chiefly
from Columbina,) and her natural heat (the two columns of life) began to
decay. She was often with Apollo to have this issue stopped, but there after a
long debate, she was positively advised, by the unanimous vote of the most
exquisit Doctors assembled of purpose to know the nature of her disease, for to
continue the issue still open, for if she stopped it, she was like to fall into
a worse malady, viz. a dangerous dropsy, whereof there appeared in her some
symptoms, by the unquenchable thirst she has of domination and rule.

Moreover it is lately given out that she intends a speedy pilgrimage to
Delphus, for a cordial against the weakness of her stomach, in regard the
concocting heat seems to be somewhat impaired; for whereas before she never used
to disgorge, what she had once swallowed, she has lately cast up some good
bits, yea the most precious and sweetest she had, when she cast up the last,
all her Saints were a while taken away from her, so that she had not one left
to pray unto; whereby it appears though her appetite be as good as ever it was
to like all she sees, yet the retentive virtue of her stomach is not so
strong as formerly.

Lastly, the Regions over which the broad spreading Olive signorizeth, are
squared up and down, and dispersed by such an unsociable distance (which makes
him receive baffles sometimes from petty companions) that except Elaiana her
self, and not all she neither, but that part which gives the Castle for its
crest, together with Columbina, and some trienniall donatives she has from
Hipparcha, the in-come does no where countervaile the charge of garrisons and
governors. Yet I must confess, the two benefits that accrue to him by this
diversity of territories are very considerable, First the opportunity to
propagat piety; Secondly, to have choice of employments for his subjects, and
means thereby to breed up wise, undertaking and heroicke spirits;

For great commands elevate the mind to great thoughts, which being conversant
with weighty, and high passages, the soul is inlargd thereby; whereas
inferior states by their petty employments and slender rewards impoverish and
abase the fancy, rendering it too narrow for high undertakings. Countries of
conquest cannot be conserved without continual expense, nor their service usd
with like assurance, specially by Elaiana,

which can rely no where upon mere love and fiduciary obedience, unless it
be at her own home, where I cannot deny but she is exemplarily loyal to her
self in a high exact obedience. Touching other places she may be said to hold
them, as one should do a Wolf by the ears; nor will I speak now of the
crazines of her title to many of them: So, that she is never in perfect
tranquillity abroad; and she esteems her self to be in a manner in perfect
peace, if she has only to do with that huge Bramble of Alclarona; so that
it may be hence inferred, that the Olive is of late years much degenerated from
his Primitive nature, for whereas he was used to be the Emblem of peace, he
now ruffleth in a continual course of arms; And this is the reason I believe,
that the branch of Olive, which at the beginning was the ancient cognizance of
Elaiana, is turned of late years to the Ragged staff.

The Ampelonian Satyr, having thus disgorg'd his stomach suddenly ran in,
and re-imboschd himself.

For my own particular, let AMPELONA tattle what she will against Elaiana, I
profess to honor her for sundry reasons, I very much honor her for the
solidnesse and secrecy of her Counsels; For her loyalty to her Prince, her
patience and admirable phlegm, her painful and long molded consultations (
proles tarde erescentis Olivae) her deep prudence and circumspection, and
indeed the Olive being sacred to Pallas is an Emblem of prudence as well as of
peace; she deserves honor for her constancy, though with infinite expense and
numberless inconveniences, for the recovery of her own; And without doubt it
was a singular blessing from heaven, that the discovery of Columbina, with the
conquest thereof was reserved for her; I respect her for her perpetual
professed feud against the common enemy, That her plants never rove abroad to
bear arms for any strange Prince, whereas others receive pay, and serve under
the banners of Infidels, and oftentimes against their own natural Princes;
And as for Wars, so for Wares they go not abroad any where to traffic but
into the dominions of their own Prince, which makes the Olive to have no small
advantage of his neighbors upon any sudden breach.

Amongst other places where the Martial Olive shoots forth his imperious
boughs, Leoncia is one, and thither I am bound next, but the worst is, that I
must pass through the very heart of Ampelona; a mighty incommodity. For she
being in perpetual diffidence, or actual enmity with her, but always emulous
and suspectfull of her, I am afraid to be stopped or searchd, if not stripped in
the way; And if I pass by Sea, I may chance fall from the trying pan into the
fire, I mean into the hands of the Italians, who of all other are most
skillful in rummaging and pillaging; Besides I use to have a squeazie stomach
on salt Water, for I do nothing but tell what Tree the Ship is made of.

A CHARACTER OF LEONCIA.
-- Noli irritare Leonem. AND now have I gaind Leoncia the cockpit of the
Western world, and Academy of arms for many years. The modern (though
meanest) kind of Militia is here altogether in practice, which consists in
blockments and batteries, not pitched fields. Never was there such a small
circumference of ground, so turned up, and unboweled by the Pioner, so watered
with blood, and calcined as it were by the flames and fury of War: which has
made it a fatal piece of inheritance to Elaiana, who has tuggd here so long
for her title, with such a vast profusion of treasure and effusion of blood,
that if she had not bin draind this way, she might have tiled her palaces with
occidentall gold and silver, and by this time happily have made her self
Mistress of Timaurania her next transmarin neighbor, and regaind the Mount of
Olives and achiev'd other high feats against Alcharona: The vast expenses she
has been at, to reduce Leoncia to her old obedience, and entire subjection,
exceed the value of the thing it self forty times over at least, if all
Leoncia were to be sold in the market by outcry; And questionless envy her
self must needs acknowledge this so costly a constancy in Elaiana never to
abandon her own, to be a brave magnanimous virtue.

Leoncia has many Groves of different plantations, but in the stem of
Elaiana they all met as lines in one center, and came to be ingrafted all upon
one stock, some by conquest, others by donation, and cession, but most of them
by inoculations; There was a design more than once to reduce them all to a
kingdom; But the multiplicity of customs, and miscellany of municipall
rights, that sundry places claim by inheritance, were not compatible with a
Monarchy: and the invading of this freedom of customs with that of the
conscience, was the first fatal cause of Leoncias revolt from her allegiance
to Elaiana.

The royal Olive was solemnly sworn at his Inauguration to observe these
things inviolable; then to come to visit her once every seventh year,
himself; as also to rid her quite of all foreign force, and to perform other
obligatory conditions; But he being once gone, and being dispensed withal for
his septenniall visit by a holy instrument from Petropolis, he resolvd to
govern them by subalterne Ministers, who it seems scrud up the pinnes of
power too high, they laid on new taxes, felled down some of the ancientst tall
Trees (as the Roman did the heads of the poppies) so that they might be
compard to the Axe in the Fable, who having got a handle of the Woods with much
entreaty, fell afterward to cut down and destroy them at pleasure: A Counsel
of blood was erected, and a harder yoke laid upon the conscience in holy
rites. One reason the Olive gave, was, that Leoncia her self began to infringe
her old privileges by introducing new forms into divine service, and
abolishing the old, in which by virtue of his primitive oath he was
indispensably sworn to continue them; And thus the argument was retorted.

Druina and Ampelona intervend to compose these differences, but they had a
short answer of the Olive, that he needed not the help of any, to reduce his
own subjects to conformity, but the odds that were, he would refer to the
Cedar his Cozen, who as it seems proving no indifferent Arbiter, Leoncia
sheltred her self (though Druina had the first tender made her both of
protection and Sovereignty) under the branches of the Royal Vine, who sending
the very next of his own stem to govern her, he attempted, by the
praecipitat Counsel of some green springals about him, to ravish her, and
render himself absolute. But he had a foul repulse; yet she profferd again
her protection to the Vine, who having a most pernicious fire kindled (as it
was thought after by the Factors of Elaiana) within the very bowels of his own
Forest, he had work enough cut him out to extinguish that. Hereupon she
made her humble recours to DRVINA, who as well for her own security (as the
state of things then stood) as movd with much Princely compassion to succor
the afflicted, gave her shelter. In so much that ever since Druina has servd
her as a back of steel, and her forces have been the very sinews of her
strength against the strokes of the ragged staff, and the iron rod of
Elaiana; who in those Groves she reserves yet under her protection and
obedience, continues to cut and loppe her to close, that one shall hear up
and down a repining rather against the harshnesse of government, then a desire
of revenge against the Enemy.

A CHARACTER OF ITELIA.
-- Et jam nos inter opacas
Musa vocat salices.
AMongst others which did Emancipat themselves from their obedience to Elaiana,
Itelia was the chief, who by creating her GROVE of WILLOWES to a republicke,
and drawing after her five and more of the neighboring Groves into one body
politic, in lieu of the Olive, took the Orange to govern her, yet far
from the degree of Sovereign power, but rather to serve her in a high martial
way: And to bear up against the Orange, the Olive did luckily light upon a
notable Ligurian Thorn who made the willowes to feel his Prickles in many
places, and twixt the Orange and Thorn sundry brave encounters, and cunning
traverses of war happened. By these means Itelia brought one of her Fisher
towns to be the prime Mart of all Leoncia, and to a stupendous height of
commerce and riches, and other strange feats she has done since, to the
astonishment and admiration of all that know her. And it seems all things
conspird to raise Itelia to this pass; First, the distance of her great
Master; the humor of her plants being of a nature patient and industrious and
more inclinable to a democraticall government; Add hereunto the quality of the
Country every where indented with water, and thereby fortified, and made
inaccessible, nature her self undertaking that way her protection, so that she
can overwhelme and turn her self into one pond when she list. Hereunto concurd
a further advantage of situation, having behind her Elatena, and her great king
the Fir, for her friend, and those places which afford all kind of materials
for shipping, and for all kind of nutriment and military supplies hard before
her Druina and Ampelona, both swarming with superfluous Graffes, and
suspectfull of Elaiana's greatness, and thereby not unwilling to contribute
strength for community of danger, and consequently of reciprocal conservation,
which must needs be the strongest tie of Political love.

But now me thinks I spy again a Sun burnt wainscot faced Satyr rush out
of Elaiana, swelling with spleen and revenge and bursting out into these
vociferations; That Itelia is the nearest neighbor to Hell of any place upon
earth, because seated lowest, and so is thought to confer sometimes with
infernal spirits: That she is a double Vsurpresse, in detaining not only
Elaiana from her right, but the very fish of the Sea also from their
habitation; That she lives upon others idleness; That her state is patched up
of depredations; That she is the rendevous of all schismatickes; that if one
wanted a religion, he might have his choice there; That God and nature never
intended her for a mansion to rational creatures, she being destitut of the
most necessary things that conduce to maintain them; That she burns up her
earth before the day of judgment; That whereas her willowes were usd to be of
a pliable and humble nature, they are degenerated lately to Trees of a tougher
bulk, yea into stubborn poplars; so that if occasion were offered, the Oak
and the Vine would find it a harder task to suppress them, then ever they had
to raise them; That in her negotiations with Druina and Ampelona she has
turned entreating to treating: That she has been the Incendiary directly or
collaterally of all the combustions that have happened this side the line, ever
since her revolt from the Olive; That she is a forge of false Coins, whereby
she has damnified Elaiana as much as any other way, by importing counterfeit
stampes: that she has rare inventions to export Gold and Silver, to raise or
depresse their rates, and abase the allay; That she has reaches beyond JEW,
or GENOWAY in new ways of Usury, in Banks, Lotteries, and Lombards, in
bargaining and bartering, for she will make the Fox tail pay for the whole
skin; That she marr's her neighbors Markets abroad, underselling them in
their own commodities; That she is grown extraordinary witty in devising new
tortures, by fire and water, as she made trial lately upon the Druinians in
Baymona: In fine that She is a nest of Water Ratts, a mount of Pismires, the
Caterpillar Cankar and Cobwebbs that infects the Olive and hinders his further
growth, the verminet that corrodes his mines.

Thus the Elaianian Satyr did rave, and rend the very air with his loud
clamors, but in regard they are but the fruits of adusted choler, and the
evaporations of a vindicative spirit, Itelia needs not much care for them,
besides she must give loosers leave to speak. For my own particular, I profess
to respect and love Itelia for diverse regards, yea, I admire the Itelians for
their industry and inventions at shore and sea, where they swim like Elephants,
whiles other wade like sheep, and indeed they are the only doers of miracles in
these modern times, for they force an habitation with infinite expense and
pains out of the very jaws of Neptune, by checking his impetuous billows,
and teaching the world, how much art, can curb and control Nature.

I love them for their cleanliness, in their food, fabrickes, and shipping;
for their singular parfimony, for their perseverance, and indefatigable pursuit
of their designs at home and abroad, For that rare unity and unanimous zeal
they have to the common good, which is such that so many differing Groves seem
to be but one Tree girt about with the cincture of concord.

I wonder at them for their prudent and equal distribution of wealth, not one
amongst them being excessive rich or excessive poor, nor upon any part of the
earth fewer beggars, it being as rare to see one there, as it had been to have
met with a Poet in Platoes commonwealth. I honor them for their exactness in
military discipline, for no where is the marching Soldier more regular, I
commend them for their plain downright dealing, and punctuality in payment of
cambios, contracts and the Soldiers Salary, and herein give me the service of
a commonwealth, rather than a kingdom; And lastly, I must love them in regard
they are the surest confederates of Druina, for I know not, where else she can
pick out a fast friend, or reposefull confident of such reciprocal interest,
and whose politic ends are so concentricke; a friend that will shine with her
in the dark, if need be, as old willowes use to do: That she helps away
Druina with many of her superfluous Graffs, and breeds her military
Instruments, and touching the mutual dependency of conservation between them,
that Emblem of the two pitchers swimming together representing Druina and
Itelia with this motto, Si concutimur, frangimur, carries with it a great deal
of truth. I respect her that she stuck close to Druina in two great actions;
one of defense, the other of offense against Elaiana; And could Elaiana have
brought her intentions home to her aim, as to have rangd all Leoncia to an
entire obedience, and so have made her her chief rendevous, and magazin of
instruments of war, and Academy of arms, what just danger and perpetual
concussions of fear, she would have struck into Druina and Ampelona also, one
of a mean capacity and foresight may easily judge.

And now that Itelia is come to so convenient and settled subsistence, it were
no unwholesome advise that she would take for her motto, -- Nil ultra, hic
terminus esto.

A true maxim it is, and ever has been, that, that state which goes out of
the lists of mediocrity, passes also the limits of safety: there is a cloud of
examples to this purpose: while Sparta kept her self within those boundaries
that Lycurgus prescribed unto her, she was both safe and flourishing; but
attempting to enlarge her territories by new acquests of other Cities in Greece
and Asia, she went every day declining: But what need I rake the ashes of
antiquity for instances so far off? Let Adriana her sure friend and
confederat forewarne her, who no longer then one age ago, thinking by
offensive undertakings upon her neighbors to spread her wings wider, was like
to mewe all her feathers.

Therefore Itelia should do well, to stand now chiefly upon the defensive,
specially near home, for it is no less prudence, to preserve then purchase,
And if she thinks to grapple more, I fear it will weaken her hold, and must
needs prejudice some places which now flourish with commerce under her, that
have risen out of the ruins of these she goes about to fasten upon on
further, and besides (which is not the least thing to be thought upon) it will
breed scruples and ombrages of doubts in her confederats, and draw on her self
more envy then she is aware of.

It is not improper that the Itelian is compard to the Ant for his sedulity and
labor; and let him still continue an Ant, for if he think to turn to a fly
Elaiana will tell him she has a proverb, that God ^ives wings to the Ant,
that she may destroy her self the sooner.

The truth is, that Itelia is grown up, by an extraordinary industry, to a
mighty height and subsistence of wealth, and navigable power: and the world is
now at that pass, that he who is Lord of the Sea, is also of the shore; Nor I
dare avouch, did the Roman republicke though as well swadled in her infancy, as
any that ever was, come near her in so short a time, and some observe that in
her proceedings she draws to a near analogy with the R^man, whose two most
advantageous virtues in casting the foundation of that vast monarchy, was
pains, and parsimony; for the first, she is admirable, specially at Sea, where
She swimmes like the great Leviathan, and carries away Druina's fish by whole
fleets, turning them abroad into present treasure, or bartering them for rich
commodities; and this may be said to be one of the maine staples of her
commerce. It is traffic that gives her a being, in the mystery whereof she
over-reacheth all others, for navigation being her only trade, and having
little or no lands at all to manure, she digges into the bowels of the deep,
and having had in times passed but a few fisher boats, she now displayeth her
colors through all parts of the vast Ocean, where any of the winds blow,
which from the number of four she first brought to a subdivision of two and
thirty, And of these four worthies which compassed the terrestrial Globe one
was hers, two of the other of Druina.

And it seems Nature her self has purposely designed her Natives and the
Country it self for Navigation and Negotiation; Them, as I said before by a
dextrous kind of propensity, the Country, by apt position; For many mighty
rivers passing through her Territories to disimboke themselves into the Ocean,
they may be said to pay her tribute as well as to Neptune; which rivers
branching themselves into large and bearing streams, do so fitly serve one
another, and all the whole, that it seems dame Nature, in framing humane
bodies did not discover more providence in the distribution of veins and
arteries for the easy conveyance of blood into each part, as she has showed
here in dispersing, and disposing of those waters so orderly for traffic:
These Rivers bring her what the large continent of Rhenusium, and other
Eastern dominions use to afford, and she lying between them and the Sea,
furnishes them with all sorts of far fetchd foreign commodities; Thus she makes
a rare virtue of necessity, for having almost nothing of her own, yet She
abounds with all things.

Furthermore it is observed that war, which uses to impoverish others,
enricheth her, for navall prizes make up a good part of her wealth; But while
want and war makes her thus trot up and down, it is questiond, if her plants
were rooted in some self sufficient soil, whether they would still continue
so industrious; or whether they would subsist as well if they were suffered to
rest in a supine and perfect peace, as they have done hitherto in war; peace
leaving every one to attend his particular pleasure or profit, while the
apprehensions of fear in time of war make all concur for the common safety:
And the long familiar habitude, they have had of arms is such, that they have
as much certainty in their art of War, as others have in theirs of peace.

Touching these doubts I will not undertake their decision, but leave it to
them, who have felt the pulse of their dispositions longer then I. There is no
part of the habitable earth, considering the small circuit of territory Leoncia
has, where there is a greater number of martial instruments, for the Olive
cut his Ragged staff out of one of these Groves, at first, where there is also
a greater confluence of all sorts of exoticke plants, and where one may find
more differing rites, customs and tempers of humors. They that border upon
Ampelona are quick, vivacious and approaching the conversable nature of their
neighbors: They that spring up in the middle part, which are the right
L^oncians, somewhat more flow, and retird. The Itelians discrepant from both,
respectlesse of gentry, of few words, for they barrel up commonly more then
they can broach, and so may be said to be like a great bottle with a narrow
neck; yet are they most cunning and circumspect in negotiating, specially when
they have bin tampering with the Vine or the hop, and are dabbled a little with
their liquor. They are of a homely out side, and heavy in action, which
heaviness is recompensed with two notable advantages, advisednesse and
perseverance, mighty friends to great attempts; And all this may be imputed to
the property of the soil it self, which being all twixt marsh and moorish,
has such a qualifying force, that when plants of a more vivacious temper come
to ingraft amongst the Willowes and Osiers, their imps presently partake rather
of the nature of the soil, then the stock, and so do all animals else.

Having thus traversed the diameter of Ampelona, visited Elaiana, passed
through Leoncia, and taken such a painful survay of Itelia, and her
associated Groves, I should seem injurious to Druina to have saluted her so
slightly; Therefore I will re-imbarke and steer my course thither again, and
then proceed in my maine design.

OF DRVINA.
AAnd now me thinks I am arrived in a little new world, so self sufficient
that she seems as it were to thrust away from her all the world besides, as
being a substantive that can stand by it self.

This is she upon whom the beams of true piety did shine in the very infancy,
for no sooner had the Roman Eagles been there displaid, but the standard of
the cross appeard: The first Emperor and King that ever marchd under that
banner issuing out of her bowels. This is she, who had three great Kings her
Captives at once, who made one of herroyall Oaks carry away in triumph
Ampelonas Lillies upon his victorious branches where they have grown and
blossomd ever since. The Imperial Cedar servd under her colors, quartering
his arms with hers, and receiving pay himself; And in that Martial Forest
of Ampelona, her exploits were so admirable, that it has been questiond, and
that by no mean Critickes, whether here is there, or sometimes Rome's high
feats of arms against the Hannibalian Carthage were more difficult and
glorious.

This is she that performd such costly expeditions and Martial pilgrimages to
the upper world, and in her voyage thither (as a revenge for inhospitality)
conquered the Citherean Isle, and for her exemplary prowes was offered the
Crown of the holiest of Cities, and more then once the Imperial diadem of
the western world; Her Monarques living in that sublimity and largeness of
repute, that they were taken to be the common Arbiters of Sovereign quarrels
up and down the world. In fine, this is she who of late years raysd the
Willowes to such a height from a company of Shrubbs, by preserving them from
being crushed by the ragged Staff of that broad spreading Olive Elaianas King,
whom she exhausted and reduced to such an exigent, that by public Declaration
he proclaimd himself insolvent of those vast sums he had taken upon credit;
whereby it was then said, He made more ill faces up and down amongst the
Banquiers on the Exchanges, then ever that famous Painter Michael Angelo made
good. This is she who clothes not only her own natives and circumiacent
neighbors, but the remotest regions of the earth with her rich fleeces, where
the innocent creatures that bear them in that exuberancy, being free from the
affrightments of all savage and rapacious animalls, feed securely upon the
luxurious honysuckled earth, which dame nature, by a most exact distribution
(as if she had wantoniz'd and played the Bawd with her self) has cut out into
varieties of sportfull plains, fertile valleys, and delightful hills, whose
bowels in sundry places are pregnant either with inexhaustible veins of most
useful, and well concocted mineralls, or necessary fuel: No Region abounds
more with Chases, Parkes, Woods, Groves, and goodly Trees, and of all other,
Druina is beholden to Trees, for with their Boughs a good part of her preserved
it self from the enemy by a notable stratageme: Her lower region swarms with
all sorts of foul, her Rivers with fish, and her Seas with whole shoales and
mountains of them, which her neighbors know too well. This is she which for
the benignity of the clime is called the female Paradise, and not without good
Judgment did that great Archflamin give her youth the attribute of Angels,
she produces such pure complexions. And the heavenly (bodies it seems) work
not here outwardly only, but they have an interne inclinatory operation upon
the motions of the mind also in a different manner from others, for her natives
are not so light and airie, as her next transmarin neighbors, nor so
affectedly grave and slow as others, nor so dull and heavy as those of that
soil, whence they were first transplanted, but of a middle composed temper,
symbolizing nearest with them of Bombycina; And it is well known, that the
Druinian has bin evrey where so cried up for an innated integrity, that before
he mingled with Forreners, and so by Coalition with them grew more Mercuriall;
he was accounted the uprightst dealer of any other upon earth, and to this day
he retains much of his primitive esteem, that in diverse places abroad, his
very word will countervaile the bond or pawn of another.

To conclude, this may be termd the land of fortune, and a microcosme of her
self, which by the gentle influence of the stars, abounds with that
affluence of all things, that for hospitality among her own, and toward all
comers else there is not her parallel: her delight is to have old Trees without
doors, and old servants within; And indeed so plentiful she is in hospitality,
that I have heard Druina taxd abroad, that too many in her, do use to dig
their own graves with their teeth. Besides, some think that since the hop
has got amongst them, her Trees being subject to be filled with stones and
gravel, it hinders the length of their growth, withal, it is observd the Grape
does them no good, being of late years usd to be so sophisticated with
sulphury heterogeneous mixtures; Add hereunto their too early inoculations;
And that odd kind of smoke which has fatally got amongst them, and being so
excessively suckd, must needs dry up their radical moisture, and so hasten
their fall: but all this is accidental: I will end with one property Druina is
cried up for, above all other, that when Forreiners, though sprung up under the
daintiest climes take once rooting in her, she makes them quickly forget their
own homes: As if the lotus grew only here, the virtue of whose fruit is, to
cause in the eaters an oblivion of all other soyles; and indeed the lotus of
all other Trees has most affinity with the Oak.

There is no place upon the habitable earth, where the muses have two such
dainty Groves of Laurels, so choice and rich seats, which both for plentiful
exhibitions, and sumptuous edifices of that kind are unparalleld: They
perpetually produce hopeful young cions, which germinat with all kind of
knowledge, and come by degrees to a perfect maturity, whereby she is always
furnished with nurseries of scientificall graffes, which she disperseth up and
down to unfold the sacred Oracles, for which she is now as renowned, as some
times she was for her Druyds; And for a cumble of all felicity piety shines
here in her genuine true luster, neither adulterated with any forced colors to
set a specious gloss upon her, by any phantasticke form of outward ceremony;
Nor is she bereavd of such decent robes and rites (whereof some fanaticke
spirits would strip her stark naked) that may make her appear in a venerable
and comely garb: This stately Forest has multitudes of gentle lodges, and
strong retraites, amongst which the great Emporiall Tamisond is the prime,
which take all her dimensions together, (for she has not the advantage of the
circular figure) with her suburbian, and conterminent fabrickes, may well
compare in magnitude and number of souls with the greatest assembly of houses
in the lower world. For wealth and an ubiquitary commerce, none can exceed her,
And for government diurnall and nocturnall with a grave rich and magnificent
magistracy, there is not her fellow. The proud River which makes her bed at her
feet is arched over with such a curious pile of stones, that, considering the
rapid course of the deep stream that roares under it, may well take place
amongst the wonders of the world; The Nereian goddess comes twice every
natural day fourscore thousand paces off to visit her, to render her thanks
as it were, for the rich tribute she uses to pay her. Here is the Imperial
chamber of Druinas Monarque, the prime rendevous of Nobles and Gentry, the sole
staple of the Merchant, all the prime tribunalls of justice and equity, and no
where is the criminal part thereof so cautiously executed, or the life of the
meanest shrub more valued, I could wish the civil part were answerable in
point of expedition, and that John an Oaks had not so many turnings and
windings in this Forest. In sum, this is the epitome of all Druina, so that
some have askd abroad whether Druina be in Tamisond, or Tamisond in Druina;
And herein (and that not undeservedly) Druina is taxd abroad of a solaecisme in
her government, that she should suffer to run into one Grove, that sap which
should go to vegetat the whole Forest; so that some have compard Tamisond to
the spleen in the natural body, by whose swelling the other members become
ill affected; whereas her foreign neighbors, by a wholesome distribution
appropriat some staple commodity or peculiar charter of commerce to several
places, whereby they equally flourish, grow populous, potent and opulent.

A CHARACTER OF CARDENIA.
Toward the septentrionall corners of Druina, there stands another Forest
which serves her for a shelter as it were against blustering Boreas, well set,
but nothing so thick, with stout and tough Trees (though grown somewhat knobby
of late) of a different plantation and policy, which has been but lately
co-afforested with her: at that time when she threw the fortunat cast of
sice-ace, and when to her three former Lions, there was a fourth added for her
defense, which made Druina verify that, which all former ages held for a
Paradox, and take for the burden of her song (and I hope there will be never
cause to the contrary:) Omne bonum nobis ex Aquilone venit.

An ancient Forest she is, for she pretends to show a continued uninterrupted
succession of above one hundred Kings.

As at other times, so specially this last half century of years, she has
produced many ventrous and martial spirits, who for their prowess in the
North east parts have purchased a great esteem.

A long time the royal Vine made use of her Trees as of matches to set Druina
a fire, whenever she attempted any thing against him, puzling her with
unlucky diversions, therefore the Vine reserves to this day a row of them about
him for his safety. This caused many of the Martial Oaks to make sundry shrewd
inrodes into Cardenia, so far as to bring away her Kings Captive, and make some
of them breath their last in battle; But now for the greater glory of Druina,
they are both ingrafted upon one stock into one body politic, and receive
mutual benefit from each other, the one sap, the other strength; For by this
conjunction, I hope, Druina may rest secure, that the Lillies shall never
hereafter make use of the Thistle against her Roses; And so she may prove
Carduus Benedictus unto her.

A CHARACTER OF MONTICOLIA.
Toward the hilly corners of Druina remain yet her very Aborigenes, and
ancient Indigenae, the first nursery of Plants, that sprouted out of her,
fatally thrust amongst an Assembly of mountains. They long time wrastled and
strenuously tug'd for their liberty, and that with a no less magnanimous then
constant pertinacity, yea when they were reducd to a handful, hemmed in
between those hills, they did notable feats; At last being over set with
multitudes (which has been the fortune of the bravest spirits upon earth)
they chose to bow a little, rather then break. Yet with this proviso, that the
Princely spray which should be their top Tree, should spring forth from
amongst themselves: So prevalent is the instinct of nature, and energie of
fancy they bear to their own soil.

And very remarkable it is, that after the revolution of above one thousand
years, and so many turmoyles and changes of governments and masters, ( Druina
having four times yielded to the fury of foreign force) the just hand of
providence should bring the royal Oak to sprout again out of this ancient
stock, and that Druina should resume, and be known again by her primitive
denomination; A race of resolute stout Trees they are, much valuing the
antiquity of their growth, and so abounding with metal and heat, that they
quickly take fire, and become touch-wood; they often clash their branches one
against the other, and very sensible they are of parting with the least drop of
sap.

The Trident-bearing God has not such secure and commodious inlets, or rather
a Gallerie of Clossets, to court and imbosome himself into our Grandame Earth,
in all the vast expanded Ocean.

The prime of the nine Hero's (whom beside that which is fabulous, there is
truth enough to make famous) was a plant of this growth, by whose conquests
Druina may lay just claim (though she had no other) not only to Lurana, but
other dominions also, nay if first discovery may entitle a right, to Columbina
also, which as some strongly conjecture, was found out by a straying Prince of
Monticolia seven ages since: And this presumption is drawn from the analogy of
speech, wherein there are diverse words that are the same in both languages,
both for sound and sense, with other traces and marks. The most admird of all
profane Prophets whose predictions have been so much scanned and cried up,
and are yet valued up and down the world, did vaticinate here: And the first
Monastery that ever the world had, wherein the sacred fire of Christian piety
did burn, was amongst these mountains, the sparkles whereof flew so far, that
diverse Regions, which groapd before in the dark corners of paganism, were
enlightened thereby.

Beside observable it is, what a precious blessing is lately found out (having
been reserved and lockd up as it were all this while in Natures bowels) to
make this most ancient part of Druina happy now in the decrepit age of the
world; A rich mine and generative mint of treasure, the gainefull returns
whereof, exceed more and more the labor and charge of those multitudes that
are hourly set a work thereby.

A CHARACTER OF LVRANA.
Opposite to Monticolia Lurana stands, separated by a most boisterous and
working sea; she is replenished and very thick set with strong and well
trunked Trees of all sorts, reduced at last to a perfect obedience to Druinas
diadem partly by voluntary reddition and desire of protection, and partly by
conquest: A multiplying and healthy spacious Forest she is, plentifully
furnishd with all those benefits, that air, earth, and water use to afford
for necessity or pleasure. There are no where such huge ponds and fresh lakes,
with goodly rivers and safe maritime harbors inviting foreign commerce, the
soil fatt and luxurious in diverse places, and antipatheticall to all venomous
creatures, as Druina her neighbor is to all ravenous; Her lower region is
stird, and rarefied with fresh quickening winds more frequently then other
Forests, which makes her less subject to contagious diseases; so that I
believe the saying of that Elaianian General (who being asked what he thought
of Lurana, answered; That when the ill spirit profferd our Savior all the
kingdoms of the earth, he verily believed he intended to have still reserved
Lurana for himself) proceeded rather from the resentment of the ill success
and disgraceful repulses he had there, then from any sound judgment, or
demerit of the Country; Nor can I subscribe to him that said LVRANA was a good
Country for them only to live in, who wanted a Country, that sh^e is a
fripperie of Bankerupts, who fly thither from Druina to play their after-game.
The plants here are of a strenuous Bulk, agile and very patient of hardness,
though not of labor, for the greatest fault of this great FOREST is, that
she swarms with too many Drones, whereby She may be called insignis, sed
segnis terra, Somewhat incomposed they are in their trimming, extraordinary
tender (and so are the brute Animalls also) of their young ones, crafty and of
a passable reach of understanding, light of belief and great listners after
news, which may be imputed to the long time of their unsettled government,
fearing always some innovation or imminent danger, And by reason of their
frequent revolts they have drawn upon themselves the pressures of war so often,
that it seems to have somewhat cowed their spirits, as may be gathered from the
very accent of their words, which they prolate in a whining kind of querulous
tone, as if they were still complaining and crest-fallen; nor do they believe
to have come yet to the worst, for they have an old prophecy that the time will
come when Lurana shall weep over the Druinians graves. Before this rough
forest was civillizd, and trimmed by Druina, she had peculiar laws and customs
of her own, but some of them were such that as one said, if they had been
practiced in Hell they would have turned up tupsiturvie the very kingdom of
Satan, Some of Druinas Monarckes made voyages thither in their own persons; and
many of the royal stem were sent to govern, but always one of her prime
Elmes, to whom I read of four general submissions that were made* but the
conquest could not be consummated till of late years, which may be imputed to
some errors in the course of civil and martial policy.

It was the practice of that self admiring mistress of the last Monarchy,
into all Countries where she took footing, with the lance to bring in her
language, and laws; This was not done here, but the Natives were left still
incapable of Druinas laws, which only extended to her own plantations: So
that the law of the Conqueror, did neither protect their life's, nor revenge
their deaths, for it was no felony to fell down any of them, yea in time of
peace: Nor in civil causes could they implead or commence suit against any of
the Druinians, or imbud, ingraffe, insoliat or inoculat upon any of them
unless he were formerly infranchizd by charter of denization; so that the
mere Luranians were reputed, out-lawes, enemies and Aliens in their own
soil; But this may be ascribed not so much to the policy of Druina, as to the
great ones that came thither from her to plant themselves and push on a
fortune, who dissuaded the communication of Druinas laws to the natives,
because they might oppress, spoil, rob, peele, proyne, and grubbe them up at
pleasure; In these unsettled times many of Druina, and of late years of
Cardenia also took firm rooting in the best and fattest soyles of Lurana, so
that they are grown since to a notable height; Amongst whom (now that I treat
of Trees) the Cork did thrive wonderfully, and no doubt but by a singular
benediction from above, the dew of heaven falling so plentifully upon his
endeavors, as appears in all his branches, which he sees grafted upon noble
scutcheons, and honorable shields; so that he may be called the miracle of his
time, all things considered.

Another reason that hindered a settled peace, and period of this conquest, was
those vast proportions of lands which were distributed among Druinas
Adventurers, which were such, that the whole Forest was in a manner cantonizd
amongst a very few in number, of whom some had regal rights, there being eight
County Palatines at once where the royal writ could not run; They had also
implicit Commission left to discretion, and not tied to any regular form of
plantation; And those huge tracts of ground they lorded over begat wealth,
wealth usherd in pride, and pride tumultuary contentions amongst themselves,
which gave the Luranians advantage to fish in those troubled waters for their
liberty, and make often encroachments upon them; But had the Oak himself gone
to the Forest, the inferior Trees had not shot up so high.

Another mistake was, that the first undertakers made ill choice of the seats
of their habitations; for they erected forts and houses in the open plains,
turning the Natives into the Woods and places of fastness, whence they made
eruptions and retraicts at pleasure, and whereas Caesar sometimes spoke of the
Scythians, Difficilius erat invenirc, quam vincere;

These were the over-sights in civil policy, now there were also some in the
conduct of the martial affairs; first, the small handfulls of Soldiers
Druina sent, which came either unseasonably, or ill accommodated and paid.
Then the cold pursuit of the maine design, which like fire newly kindled under
green wood, was often made to flash a little, and so left to go out. So that
for the reduction of this spacious Forest to a perfect rule of obedience,
Druina stood all this while in her own light, and could not see the Wood for
Trees: until there sprung up a notable Virago a Princely female, for whom it
seems the high hand of providence had as it were pointed out, and reservd this
exploit; who besides the suppression of some intestine rebellions in her own
Forest, the raising of Itelia to a free and fair Grove of Willowes, and
reaching her Princely boughs to settle the Crown of Ampelona upon the right
royal Vine, besides the navall wars with Elaiana, and sundry other costly
diversions, yet she made a full and final conquest of Lurana; And this work
was done in a fullness of time, and concurrence of all felicity, when her
royal successor was to bring another Sovereign Crown to aggrandize, and add
to the Imperial and triumphant glory of Druina. Her predecessors in their
course of government did but sometimes cast up the ground, and so leaving it
fallowe, it became quickly oregrowne with weeds; But she like a great houswife
did cast seed into it, sowing therein her own laws, and utterly extirpating
all other; she did ingraffe all upon one stock, making no difference twixt the
Luranian and them of Druina, by which coalition she received all alike into her
immediate protection under the safe shadow of her Royal branches, making the
beams of justice to be equally displayed upon all with like luster. Yet for
all this there was little return of the vast expense of treasure that might
have served to purchase as great a Crown, which was employed to compass these
ends, nor could Lurana though a most copious Country of her self, be brought
by any parsimonious policy to support her self, but still Druina must part
with her very radical moisture, and wast her own vital spirits to preserve
her authority there, until that of late years the royal Oak did light upon
Count Rhodophill (a stout and solid instrument most proper for so knotty a
task, as well for courage as Counsel, and cut out for government and high
affairs) who balancing all matters in the scales of his high and spacious
understanding, has so rectified all obliquities, beginning first with the
vindication of wrongs done to the house of the Almighty; And so regulated the
exorbitant expenses both civil and military, that the old arrearages under
which that Crown had long gron'd being defrayed, he has brought Lurana to
uphold and maintain her self, and return Druina for her protection,
fruitfulness, and reducement to civility, a settled tribute proportionable to
her greatness and plenty; So happy and advantageous it is* for a Prince to
employ an able and idoneous Minister for the conduct of his state affairs; He
has woun'd up the strings of that Musical instrument (which Lurana gives for
her crest) so dexterously, and tuned her Orpheus-like (who in times past by his
melodious strains made the very Trees to follow him) to such a key, that she
never gave a truer note; And indeed the right way was never hit upon, until
now; Druina's Majesty never stood so high a tiptoe, nor shind with a greater
luster; The Sovereign power which Druinas Monarcke uses to transmit for
ruling and regulating that rough Forest, was never so individed and entire in
the person of one, whereas before some of the great ones carried themselves in
that height, as if they had been Colleagues with him: The scales of Justice
never moved more equally, for whereas before matters passed through a large
grate, they may be said to be sifted now through a silken sive: commerce never
flourished more; And the military forces ( which are the finewes, and best
security of a conquered Country,) were never better appointed, more exactly
disciplind, and punctually paid; And whereas before, all places of profit and
honor were either engrossed or forestalld by reversionary grants (the bane and
bug-beares of industry) or conferred upon unwor^hy and ill affected Ministers,
Druinas Monarque may now exercise all acts of grace and bounty with more
freedom and choice; A singular incitement and golden spur to virtuous and
active spirits; Lastly, the royal desmesnes and treasure was never more
improved, for whereas formerly Lurana servd as a goose for every one to pluck,
her feathers go only now to fill the pillow of the Crown: So that putting all
this together, Lurana may say as once that seven hild City which was head of
the last Monarchy (and pretends to be still of the Hierarchy) did say,
Lateritia fui, futura sum marmorea.

But I have wandered too long in this Forest, I will now hoise sail, and
return to Druina, where I shall fix my self a while, but in regard the wind
is not fair, I will stay a little, and spend the time to deduce out of what
has been spoken this short Corollarie.

Touching the relation that Druina with her united Crowns, has to other
states, it is to be considered, that the power of this part of the world, is
balanced between the Oak, the Vine, and the Olive; as for the CEDAR and
others, they shall come in hereafter.

Elaiana has the advantage of both the other in treasure, but she is thin
planted, has diverse nurseries to supply, many irons perpetually in the fire,
wants Corn, her dominions lie scattered, has bold accessible coasts, and the
conveyance of her Bullion from Columbina subject to be intercepted in the
passage; And should Druina break out again into any traverses of War, and
serious Hostility with her, Druina has lately got no small advantage of her,
by acquest of those Islands which lie in the Carreere to Columbina, which she
colonizeth, and fortifieth daily more and more.

Ampelona is thick set, and abounds with stirring Spirits, lies close
together; and being roundish and passable, no one part is far from succouring
each other: She super-abounds with Corn; which is quickly convertible to
Coin; and being the common Mart and Thorow-Faire, lying in the middle of so
many great Neighbors, can never want Money: Insomuch, that if you go to the
intrinsique value of things, she will not, in regard of these Advantages, want
much in weight, of the huge bulk of Elaiana.

Druina being surrounded with the Sea, and having always so many moving
invincible Castles in Centinell, is hardly to be invaded; her King being said
to keep as a Tortoise in his shell, and having many other Insularie
advantages. So that it may be very properly said of the Oak, as the holy
Prophet speaks of another great Tree; That the Waters make him great, and the
Deep sets him on high.

Druina would hardly be able to deal with any of the other single, unless
upon the Defensive; but joynd with Itelia, she can give them both Law at Sea;
and confederating with either of the other two, she is able to oppress the
third.

Now, the only entire Head that confronts Elaiana's greatness, and is the
Remora that stops her progress, is Ampelona: Therefore, that saying carries
with it a great deal of Truth, and no less Caution; That the day of the ruin
of AMPELONA, is the Eeve of the subversion of DRUINA. Therefore, from the time
the Olive grew to be so great, Druina for strong reasons of State, has inclind
ever since, rather to maintain Ampelona, then any way to enfeeble her. And
once, when the adventrous Vine was taken prisoner by the Olive, which was about
the time that the Olive began first to shoot out his branches so wide, the Oak
did contribute to ransom him.

Moreover, in that memorable great Incendium, which raged so long by
intermissive fitts throughout the whole Body of Ampelona; to quench which,
Elaiana, out of pretense of zeal to Religion, sent great Barrels of Water,
though some say they were filld with Pitch and Oil, which did rather increase
and feed the Fire: I say, at that time, when there was a Design to Provinciate
the whole Kingdom; Druina, though offered a Canton, would not accept of it.

So then, this link of mutual conservation enchaining them, the Oak may be
presumd to be a sure Confederate of the Vine and the Willowes also, all the
while they contain themselves within those bounds they are in, at present. But
if they should over-master the Olive in Leoncia, it would much alter the case.

No addition could make Ampelona more dangerous and suspectfull to Druina, then
Leoncia; for so it were far worse then if the Olive had all Leoncia solely to
himself, in regard they would fall into one continued and entire piece.

But to conclude, there cannot be a truer Maxim, for the safety of Druina and
her Confederates, then this of a late great Statesman: Decrescat OLIVA, nec
crescat VITIS.

And thus have I finished the perambulation of Druina, with all her Pourliews,
and Perquisits, together with her next transmarine neighbors, with whom she
has most pratique and necessary intelligence. I should now pass to Rhenusium
(and so over the Mountains, to Bombycina) but that I am afraid to loose my
self in so vast a Forest, before I should begin my promised Story: Therefore
I will defer their Character to some emergent occasion out of the matter it
self, and in the interim resume my subject, and return to my first Epoche.
But before I proceed, I will give the Reader this short touch, that I do not
purpose, by this discourse of Trees, to bring him into a Labyrinth, or
impervious dark Thicket; for I know some, under borrowed Names and Types, have
affected obscurity, of purpose to amuse the Reader, and make themselves
admired for profound Reaches, when oftentimes their Fancies prove flat
Impertinencies, and Nonsense: No; the Woods that I will lead him into, shall
be fair and open (as he may partly perceive, by what has preceded) so that he
may easily distinguish twixt the kinds of Trees; it shall be lucus a lucendo.

And imagine I am now returned to Druina; where I find all things flourishing,
in a rare conjuncture of Peace, Security, Honor, and Plenty, under the
Branches of the stately Caledonian Oak, newly settled in his triumphant Throne,
begirt with Cions of his own royal Stem, and encircled with multitudes of
ancient and nobly extracted Elmes, holy and reverend Yewes, learned Laurels,
stout Poplars, with other goodly Trees; the Lillies and Roses White and Red,
did bourgeon round about him, the Muses and Graces made Festivals, the Faunes,
Satyrs, and Nymphs, did dance their Roundelayes, all the Trees of the field
did clap their hands; and never were seen such Halcyonian days: The Saturnian
times of Gold let none henceforth admire, behold a true Pearly Age.

All the neighboring Forests stood at a gaze, envying this high felicity:
The Vine, the Fur, the Myrtle, the Willowes, sent to congratulate and comply
with Druina; but above all other, the Olive, so shrewdly shaken before by her.

To perform which work, the prime Officer of Honor Elaiana had by Land, was
sent Ambassador, and that in a most high and courtly manner, to present the
newly enthroniz'd OAK with a Branch of Olive, the Emblem of Peace, and
Elaiana's ancient Cognizance: Which being accepted, Druina in correspondence of
State, sent her prime Officer at Sea, her Thalassiarcha, in such a splendid
equipage, that Elaiana rings of the renown of it, to this day. The parts
adjoining to Elaiana's royal Court did so strain themselves to entertain and
welcome him, with his numerous Train, that some years passed, before they
could recover themselves many miles about: for so grateful was his Errand,
being an Embassy of Peace, and so bitter were the resentments and fatal
effects of the former War, that young and old did bless him as he passed;
deeming he had been some Angel descended from Heaven, and that his attendants
were some kind of Seraphins, they so admired their comeliness; which did
unbeguile the vulgar of the odd opinion the Loyolists had formerly infused
into them, by their concionatorie Invectives, That the Druinians, since they
left Petropolis, were transformed into strange horrid shapes; some having Dogs
heads, others Swines countenances, others huge tails hanging behind them.

Such Ceremonies as these being mutually performd twixt Druina and her
Confederates, and some other domestique Triumphs ended; the royal OAK (as well
to express his Princely acknowledgement for his free and peaceful reception
to Druina's Throne, without the least motion of opposition or murmr, which
usually happen at such Changes, (whereat the neighboring Princes, specially
Ampelona's then Warlike Monarch, stood in a kind of admiration) which reception
was accompanied also with unparalleled acclamations of Epidemicall joy, as
also for redress of diverse Grievances, rectifying of Enormities, and enabling
wholesome Laws) sent out Summons for a general Assembly, where his Royal
Majesty, with all the noble Elmes, the grave and learned Yewes, and a selected
number of the choicest Poplars, should meet in one Body, to consult of the
common Good; and here you might behold a goodly sight, the Epitome of all
Druina.

But there preceded a notable act of Princely grace: For whereas some, out of
the motions of a malevolent spirit, and impostumated hearts, had, during the
former universal Exultations of Joy, been detected, to have had a most
Treasonable and dangerous Design on foot against the Majesty of the Royal
OAK, whereof they had been legally convicted and doomed; He merely, out of
his inclination to Mercy, (wherein Kings come nearest to the Almighty) sent a
private Missive, all of his own Characters, to pluck tnem out of the very
jaws of Death; even then, when having made their peace with Heaven and Earth,
the fatal Axe was imminent to fall upon them, and cut them quite off. And as
this first, so were the rest of his whole reign high Acts of Clemency.

But upon the very point, when the forenamed great Congregation was to
re-assemble; behold, a horrid Plot of such a nature, that it seemd rather to
have been a Piece hammerd in Hell, by a Conventicle of Cacodaemons, then traced
by humane invention. A sulphurous Mine it was, prepared and fitted with that
Artifice, that in one Puff it should have blown up to the Clouds, and made
but a Squib of that mighty Assembly, with many thousands of innocent Souls
besides: Druina's Sovereign Monarch, with his Royal Consort, and Princely
Imps, Root and Rind, Stem and Stock, Bud and Blossom, had all been
blasted; the reverend Yewes, noble Elmes, and stout Poplars, had been all
turned to Charcoale; yea, the fury of it had extended to the Embrio in the
Womb; nay, the very inanimate Bodies had not been exempt; the sumptuous
ancient Structures near adjoining, all the Tribunals of Justice, yea, the
prime Sanctuary Druina had, would have gone to wrack; nay, it would have
raised up her dead Princes out of their sleeping Vrnes, to behold this black
Spectacle: My hair stands on end, my heart trembles at the horror of it: The
Trinacrian Vespers, and Bartholomean Massacre, were nothing to this. And
Religion must be the Mask, to cover this Hellish attempt: Tantum Religio
potuit suadere malorum?

Sacred Lady, must thou be the Mantle to cover this infandous Work? Thou which
usest to go clad in the white Vest of Innocence, must thou have a Deianira's
Shirt now cast upon thee, a Robe of Blood? Thou which marchest always with the
Armor of Light, must thou be made accessarie to such a horrible Act of
subterranean darkness? Thou which injoynest subjects indispensable obedience
to their Sovereigns, because they are the anointed and Archetypes of the
Almighty, yea Gods upon earth, must thou be now made a complice to Assassines
and Traitors? In fine, thou to whom the Prince of peace left for legacy his
seamelesse close-woven garment of unity to deck thy self, must thou be
brought to make ruptures and throw the ball of discord twixt Sovereign and
subject? Absit, absit.

For the discovery of this prodigious plot, specially the quality of it, it
seems by some secret supernatural instinct, Druinas Monarque himself, when
all his great Sages were at a stand, hit right upon it, for it being
fore-threatned, and advertisement being fortunately lighted upon, that a sudden
blow should be given, which should be no sooner doing, then a piece of paper
burning, His Majesty entering into the secret Cabinet of his own deep and
freeborn thoughts positively avouch'd, that it must be some project of
nitre, then which nothing is more sudden and impetuous, more violent and
irresistible: and herein he proved as much Prophet, as Prince.

For oftentimes the conceptions of Kings are as far above the vulgar, as
their condition is, for being higher elevated, and walking upon the battlements
of Sovereignty, they sooner receive the inspirations of Heaven.

They which make profession to pry into mysteries of estate, passed diverse
judgments upon this, some gave out, that the warlike Vine had sent advise of
it, and that the then secretst of Druinas Sages, that great instrument of state
had foreknowledge of it, but suffered the fatal thread to be spunne out to
that length for some politic respects, and then to cut it off in the very
nicke.

Not long after a notorious high act of Treason, drawing to a near analogy
with this, for the instrument was led by the same ill spirit, except that the
one was single, yet upon the person of a public person, the other of
multitudes, if you consider the Agents or Patients; The one was crushed in the
shell, as it was upon point of hatching, and so most happily prevented, but
this was fully perpetrated upon the body ot the great Martial Vine which
swayed the Scepter of the then most flourishing Ampelona; And Religion that
holy and harmless Matrone, must be made to sharpen the point of that fatal
steel which did scarifie and penetrate him to the very heart, and suddenly
felled him to the ground; It was done when he had a potent Army so famed and
feared far and near, composed of choice Veteranes upon a great mystical
design in perfect equipage, which continues a riddle to this day: And in the
midst of those triumphs that were prepared for his Queen who had her Temples
newly begirt with Ampelonas royal diadem. And her fancies it seems the night
before were prophetical, having dreamed that those Diamonds wherewith her
Crown were embellishd, did turn to Pearls, which are accounted the Emblemes
of tears.

But most remarkable it is what one of his own Confidents did forewarne him of
twenty years before, who told him being newly come to the Crown, and forced
to comply with the times in point of Ecclesiastical affairs, and being
assaulted and wounded in the mouth by a young Loyolist.

Sir, You see how just and punctual GOD Almighty is in his Judgments, for I
hope you have denied the Religion you were first nurtured in, but from the
teeth outward, so he has struck you there, but take heed your heart go not
from it, for he will strike you there the next time, which proved precisely
true.

Not unlike this prophetique judgment was that which fell upon one of his
predecessors not long before, who being so incensed against the Eusebians, that
he vowed to pluck out one of their eyes to stigmatize and distinguish them
from others; He was thrust the very same day into the eye himself by an
Eusebian, whereof he breathed his last.

A hard fate it was that three of Ampelona's Royal Monarques should fall
within so narrow a compass of time by such mortal strokes. The last the most
accomplished of all the rest, was the most lamented, who out of his cold Vine
seems, me thinks, to send this mournful caveat to the greatest potentats on
Earth.

That they are but weak penetrable things, and though somewhat refind and
kneaded from that courser sort of stuff, which goes to the composition of the
Citizens of the world, yet they are so much the more brittle ware, only they
differ in there office, which nevertheless makes them to have far less to
hope for, then to fear.

A greater example hereof there could not be then in this great Puissant
Prince, a Prince in whom nothing of worth was wanting, a pattern of all
heroique virtues, except that he was transported sometimes too far by that
Sex, which overcame the first, the strongest, and wisest, that ever were of
humane race.

Wonderful he was in acts of peace and war, he had bin victorious in four
maine battles, before he could peaceably wear the Crown, he weeded the
Kingdom of such as were devoted to Elaiana, and manumizd it, from that most
dangerous confederacy which was fermenting many years, weakening it by arms,
but dashing it to pieces by wit.

For his Acts of peace, he inrichd Ampelona with a greater proportion of silk
and wool, he beautified her in many places with sumptuous structures, cut
passages twixt great Navigable Rivers, and was like to do the like twixt Sea
and Sea. And some say he had a design to erect such a spiritual independent
dignity in Ampelona, that his subjects should not need to clammer the hills so
often to Petropolis; he dismorgagd the Crown demeanes, made an increase of
munition, arms and treasure, and left behind a mass of Gold that surmounted
the height of a Lance; And all this may be ascribd to his own activenesse.

For, as for the outward windows of his Soul, he was rarely quick and
perspicacious, so was he inwardly Eagle-eyed, and perfectly versd in the
humors of his subjects. And such a great Artist he was in government, that he
preservd Ampelona (which abounds more then one part of the Earth besides with
boisterous spirits and hot working brains) twenty years together without the
least tintamarre or noise of commotion:

A brave sprightfull Prince he was, composed of such a mould, that though he
wanted but very few years of his grand Climacterique, when the mortal Stab
was given him; yet the Anatomists adjudgd, That if Nature had been sufferd to
have run her own course in him, without this fatal interruption, he might
have doubled his Age.

Never was there Monarch, that Lorded more over his Subjects hearts: Which, as
in many passages of his Life, so after his Death it appeard; when by the
universal Vote, he was eternizd to future Ages with the Title of GREAT, and
that his Statues should be erected in all the Mart Towns of Ampelona. -- stat
Magni nominis Vmbra.

The Martial Vine being thus cut down, Ampelona fell under a Female
Government, (a Female of rare endowments and Princely worth) until the
succeeding young royal Cion should come to maturitie: And they speak of an
old Law, That the Heir of AMPELONA'S Crown is adjudgd then to have passd his
Minority, when he is grown to the height of a Sword. So that during this
Government, it may be said (notwithstanding the contrary Proverb:) Lunae
radiis maturescebat botrus.

Not long after the Vine, the mighty Olive his neighbor fell, who with his
Beads was said to preserve all his time his spacious Dominions, as his
Imperial Grandsire did by the Pike, and his Sire, that great Magus of his
days, by the Pen; who, for some rare virtues that dwelt in him, I cannot
pretermit with silence.

He was the greatest Conqueror of himself, and King of his own affections,
that ever was; being always at home within himself, in an admired equal
temper of humors: No change at all was found in him at good or bad Events, or
any sudden tumultuarie Chance; whereof I will give a few notable instances.

After that memorable great Battle and Navall Expedition against Alcharona,
(when all Bombycina, with the adjacent Islands, were at the stake) was won,
the relation being brought him, what a glorious Victory was got, and with what
difficulty, and how long she fluttred upon the wings of doubtful success, he
was not surpised a whit with any exulting motions of joy; only he said, That
his Brother, who was Generalissimo in the service, had venturd very far: And
it was the first time that he ever daignd to style him Brother, though they
were of the same Stock, but he a Branch of the wild Olive. These were the most
important and gladsomst tidings that possibly could be brought him, both
concerning himself and all the Western world, as the case then stood.

For ill news also, he was the same: For, in that mighty Expedition against
Druina, when the very Virgin news was brought him of the most disastrous
miscarriage of his Fleet, that monstrous Sea-Giantesse, the hugest that ever
spread sail upon salt water, take Bulk and Building together; when all the
circumstances were punctually related unto him, he was not moved a jot from
himself, but calmely said, He had sent them to fight against DRUINA, not
against the Deity of Heaven. And these were the saddest news that possibly
could come. This having been an Enterprise so much ruminated upon, so molded
and matur'd by time, with infinite expense; the Legalitie of the Act confirmd
and animated by a special Benediction from the great Arch-Flamin, and puffd up
with such a certitude and infallibility of hopes and presumptions, that in
Petropolis there were Bonefires already made, in joy of the Conquest of
Druina. Yet, at the said long expected relation, there appeared not in him the
least alteration or resentment in the world, for the miscarriage of this
Mighty Action, and Invincible Fleet, as she was termed; which proved, as one
said, but a kind of Morrice-dance upon Druina's Waves.

Another time, being shut up a whole day in his Closet, to dispatch some
private instructions for Leoncia, about the time of her first revolt; and
bringing them forth fairly written, to be dried, his then Secretary (that
famous minister of State) being with the suddenness of his coming surpised,
poured the Ink-box all over the Writings, and so defaced them, that they were
made altogether illegible: This did not a whit stir him, but calmely called
for more Paper, to rescribe them; showing him the difference twixt the Ink-box
and Sand-box, against the next time.

Thus in Eclipses and Sunshine, in Calm and Tempests, at ill or fortunate
Occurrences, he was immoveably the same; nor could any sudden inexpected
contingencie, were it of never so great consequence, distract, much less
divorce him from himself.

The Philosophers teach, That in natural Bodies, all things decay by the
inward conflict of their Principles, and reluctancie of the predominant
Elements: for, if a Body were eavenly balanced by the four Elements whence the
humors are derived, it would be unperishable.

The manners of the mind often follow the temper of these humors, therefore in
this Prince it seems, there were the sedomst and weakest struglings amongst
them that could be; A serious reservd speculative Prince he was, and could see
far and near without Spectacles or Prospective, and as it was said of one of
Druinas Monarques, he was used to stand in the dark to others, but he made
all the world to stand in the light to him. He would often complain against
his Sister of Druina, in that she fomented the Itelians his own natural
Subjects against him, that she intercepted his Treasure, and countenanced her
Captains to rob him in Columbina, and all this without provocation as he
thought, pretending that he had deservd otherwise of her, by being once the
chiefest instrument of saving her life, and restoring her to liberty, and
having an Ambassador resident then at her Court, when these traverses of
Enmity happened. He was a great example of PIETY in his kind, and that in
so intense a degree, that he was used to say, If he knew the Princely plant
which first sprung out of him did but brandle or haesitat in his Religion, he
would have his breast ripped up, and those thoughts plucked out of him, nay he
would gather sticks himself to burn him.

The cause of the so early fall of that Prince is a riddle to this hour, but
one time in a gay humor he wished in the hearing of his Sire, he had
Elaiana's Crown upon his head but only one day; And this extravagant wish (as
'twas thought) did him no good; for not long after, he was transplanted into
the other World by an immature Fate.

Another Argument, or rather Monument, of the Piety of this Platonique Prince,
was that Work of Wonder, that glorious Structure, which with expense of eight
Millions of Treasure, and twenty three years of Time, (he himself enjoying
the contentment of it twelve whole years after it was finishd) he causd to be
erected, in memory of that famous Battle he got against Ampelona, being then
in Leoncia: And not as much in honor of the day, as of the Martyr, whose day
it was; proportioning the Fabrique to the shape of that Instrument he suffered
upon. The Handle of it, makes a Magnificent Royal Palace; the Body, an huge
Assembly of Cloisters, which make up a Convent, and an Academie. And so
intentive were his thoughts upon this Piece of Piety, that when the long-longd
for tidings were poasted to him, of the miscarriage of the forementioned
Fleet, which sayld at first with the wings of such confidence against Druina;
he then having his eyes fixd upon a Mason, who was fitting a Cornerstone, he
would neither ask, hear, or read one syllable, until he saw that Stone
settled. Such a vast Pile was never reard up by Scaffold: and I subscribe to
them that hold, the World has not the like, in one entire Piece. And built it
is with that unusual solidnesse, and moderate height, that it seems in his
first thoughts he intended to make a Sacrifice of it to perpetuity, and to
contest with the Iron Teeth of Time. It has a Quadrangle for every Month in
the Year: and whosoever will take an exact survey of it, must go above 30000
paces forward, about and backward, within the circumference of the Walls; and
the very keys of this huge Edifice, poise above 1000 weight. This great Magus
being seizd upon by the hand of Death, he said none should carry him to his
own Sepulcher, meaning that mighty Monument, but himself: Where he was no
sooner come, but this huge Olive, which flourishd so long, (though shaken with
many shrewd storms) fell, as they say, of vermiculation, being all worme-eaten
within.

The succeeding Princely Olive, though in profound reaches of Policy he came
short of him, yet in Piety he rather exceeded him. He relied more upon the
Spiritual power then the Temporal, holding it the safest course: And indeed,
it was one of the Cardinal instructions his expiring Sire left him; and the
other was, that he might war with all the world, if he were in peace with
DRUINA. A little after, he yielded to treat with the Itelians as with
Free-States; from which words, they ever since derive their independencie,
though Elaiana deny, that she ever pronounced them positively free, but
retorts the argument upon them: For, if she condescended to treat with them as
with Free-States, the Hypothesis must be, that they were not free: for the
Topique Axiom is, Nullum simile est idem; but whether it will hold in Policy,
I will not determine.

OF RHENVSIVM. AND BOMBYCINA.
ABout these times there arrived in Druina a Rhenusian Prince ( Altapinus,) and
Rhenasium abounds with Princes, yet they are from the beginning but branches
fallen from the Imperial Cedar, whereof some are grown up single, other are
multiplied into a great number of Groves.

Huge is that extent of ground which belongs to the perambulation of this large
Forest, which were she entirely subject to the Cedar, would prove formidable
both to the Vine, the Olive, and the Oak with all other, and would be able of
her self to make head against that huge Giantesse Alcarona; But Rhenusium
being divided between so many absolute Princes, and they of about equal
puissance, (as a great River cut into many Channells grows weaker and
shallower) Rhenusium strives only to counterpoize her self.

Her Trees are well timbred, tall and beutifull, they are all commonly of the
nature of the Plane, or Hortensius his graffs, which love to be watered with
wine, but they use not only to be watered therewith, but to be overwhelmd and
drowned therein, for they drink often passively, which made one ascribe unto
them these two properties. To understand more then they can utter; And drink
more then they can carry. And the universality of this vice, seems to take
away the infancy of it; so that whosoever is temperat there, must needs be
more temperat then any where else, for he must be so, per antiperistasin,
being surrounded, and besiegd as it were about with the contrary habit. The
time was that the Cedar stretched forth his Imperial branches as far as the
Mountains of the Moon, and that the King of Birds nested within his leaves,
thick featherd, and with fullsummd wings fastening his Talents East and West;
but now I know not by what fate or fortune it is come to pass, the Eagle is
become half naked, and the Cedar very thin leavd, so that for many Ages it
has bin a kind of continual Autumn with him. In so much that whosoever will
undertake now the Imperial diadem, must have of his own wherewith to support
and protect it; which I believe is one of the reasons, that it has continued
these two Ages and more years in that stem which is now so much spoken of,
and envyed in the World. And this reason of State sounds well why the
Septemvirate lets it continue there so long, because this Race having its
hereditary territories as Ramparts upon those regions that the huge Eastern
Bramble Tyrannizeth over, is best able to preserve Rhenusium from his Fury.

But to know the true cause why the Cedar has so long warped, and fallen to
this decay, I must lead you over the hills to Bombycina, that great Magazin of
wits, and Minion of Nature, where some places acknowledge no other season but
the spring; and they who abstract Paradise from the Earthly Globe, would have
it to be in that part of the Heavens which is her Canopie.

Petropolis is the City which once awed not only all Bombycina, but signorizd
over most parts of the habitable earth, so far, that her tropheys and
territories were said to know no frontires; yet at first the circuit of her
walls was hardly a mile, and her pomerium and perquisits adjoining where they
stretched furthest, scarce six, and the first number of her plants about 3000.
Yet with time and fortune she so swelled up, that she became 50. miles about,
and her Dominions above 3000. miles long; And the number of Graffs which sprang
at one time in and about her walls, in a famous cense that was made, amounted
to above three millions.

Hence the Imperial Cedar shot out his warlike branches far and near for
many ages, until the Ivy clasping and clinging close about him, suckd out of
him much of his very radical moisture to vegetat and quicken himself, so that
those twinings and embracements of the Ivy proved but as Judas kisses, and
this among many others is one of the causes of the Cedars decay, out of whose
ruins the Ivy did climb up to a monstrous height; And if it be lawful to
pass from Trees to Birds, that memorable comparison which one publicly
preached in the very Court of the Ivy, when he was Residentiarie upon the
skirts of Ampelona three Ages since was not improper, at which time that
renowned Poet Laureat did so bitterly inveigh against the exorbitancies of
Petropolis, calling her the mother of heresy, shop of vice, and forge of
falsehood; which comparison was, that this so high grown Ivy was like that
featherlesse bird, which went about to beg plumes of other birds to cover his
nakedness, they moved with commiseration clad him with part of their own, to
which work the Eagle did contribute much; This Bird having his bareness
coverd with those adventitious feathers, did thrive wonderfully, and grew so
gay that they all turned to Peacocks plumes, into whose nature the Bird
himself did also degenerat, and it is well known what the Peacocke is Emblem
of. He began to pecke at, and prey upon those Birds that were his benefactors,
until he made some of them stark buzzards.

Others have compard the Ivy to the Stagge in the fable, which shrouded
himself under the branches of the Vine in a time of necessity, which being
passed, he fell a browzing, and to eat those leaves which preserved him; Thus
the Ivy is said to use the Cedar, with others of his Patrons, who out of a
high conceit of sanctity they held of him, because he was the great Arch
Flamin, protected him upon all occasions, and would not stand out with him in
any thing: But pity it is, that the fruits of Piety should be so abused; and
that, that high degree of honor, that great Arch-Flamin-Ship which at first
was ordained to be a spur to holiness, should after become a stirrup to
pride.

And as Petropolis at her first rise, when she came to be Mistress of the
fourth Monarchy, and was at her highest flourish, used to clip the wings of
victory, that she should not fly away from her; so she would have done to
Religion also, since the Ivy came to be her Lord, that it should be found no
where else, but between her walls; which made all the World to have recourse
to her, as to the sole Oracle of sacred Truth, the Source of saving Knowledge,
and Consistory of Mercy: and going about to monopolize Religion by these
steps, she made mere Merchandise of holy things, and grew to be an excellent
Chemist, that could transmute Lead into Gold; persuading the silly Client, that
out of that Lead he might make Keys to open Heaven Gates. Thus Religion got
wealth, Piety begot Policy, then the Daughters were said to devour their
Mothers.

Add hereunto, that it was the practice of the Ivy, to su^^itate and engage
the Cedar, with other Princes whom he could get into his grapple, to holy
Expeditions abroad, and sometimes to make them clash their branches one against
the other, at home; whereby he took often opportunity, to seize upon
something toward the strengthening and embulking of himself.

Thus the Ivy clinging so close to the Conscience, brought the Cedar, the
Vine, and the Oak, with all the Western Potentates, to bow unto him, and do
homage to his very Trunk, and in a manner to idolatrize him, and tremble as
the Aspe before him.

He qualified the Cedar with the Character of his first Son; the Vine, of his
younger; and the Oak, of his adopted; though I know no reason, why the Oak may
not challenge the right of Primogeniture above all the rest, in regard his
Crowns were first irradiated with the gleames of sacred Truth; and, as some
great Clerks avouch, before Petropolis her self: and touching that Title,
which does peculiarize Druina's Monarch from all other, it is much more ancient
then the common opinion holds it.

The Olive, this last Centenarie of years, has much complied with the Ivy,
making profession to be his Champion: and indeed, he has more reason then
others to induce him thereunto, in regard he holds most of his Dominions in Fee
of him; and amongst the rest, Hipparcha, which is one of the fairest Flowers of
his Crown, being the most delicious Soil of all Bombicina: and this he
detaines from the Ivy, much against his will, for he should be the true
possessorie Lord thereof: But the Olive dispenses with his Conscience, to
pass it over with a Complement, and a Heriot once every year, though he
incur the thunder of an unavoidable Curse thereby. But it is observd, that
that brave prauncing Courser, which Hipparcha gives for her Crest, being
formerly so full of mettle, that he would scarce brook Bridle or Saddle, has
been so broken and brought low by her, that he will now very patiently take
the Bitt, and bear a Pack-saddle or Panniers, if need require, which they lay
on him once every three years.

The Ivy, by the degrees aforesaid, being led by such another Genius, it
seems, as the first Nurserie of Plants Petropolis had, who varnishd all their
attempts with a singular reverence to the Gods, came from very small beginnings
to a stupendous height. But there is one shrewd brand on it, that his greatest
Patron opened a way to the Empire by a black way of perfidiousnesse and
Treason, in felling down that Cedar, which was his liege Lord and Master; and
to comply with the Ivy, condescended to give him, among other benefits,
Petropolis for his Court. Ever since, the great Arch-Flamin has wonderfully
thriven: for proceeding to domineere over, and captivate the noblest part of
the intellectual Creature, he assumd power to depose Sovereign Princes, to
dispose of their Diademes, and to dispense with their subjects from all ties of
natural obedience. And so liberal he has been, as to give away Druina
(which he tearmd his inexhausted Source) once to the Vine, another time to the
Olive; but with this Proviso, if they could conquer her: wherein they both
soulely fayld, though they employed the utmost of their strength.

And the Ivy came to do these Feats by force and terror, a course very
disagreeable to his Calling: For the Temporal and Spiritual Power should have
an analogy with those two faculties of the Soul, the Will, and the
Understanding: The Will deals with the Understanding by way of power and
peremptory command, but the Understanding, after a sweet way of meekness,
conducts the Will by persuasions and strength of Reason, and so leads him along
in a Golden Chain.

He amusd the World, that the Keys which open and shut Heaven, and let down
to Hell, hang upon his Branches; the threats of his displeasure, came to be as
dreadful as Thunderbolts: but of late years, they are found to be of a clean
contrary quality: For the Thunderbolt is observed to quash and crush those
Bodies, which with their toughness resist, but to spare those which are
pliable and yielding; as often times we find the Body of the Tree crushd to
flitters, when the Bark is not touchd: but those Fulminations which are darted
from Petropolis, are of a quite different nature; for upon them that withstand
and bear up against them, they are as Thunderbolts fallen into the Sea,
forcelesse.

And hereof the Royal Oak (and some hold, That the right Oak, being JOVE'S
Tree, sacra Iovi Quercus, is exempt from the stroke of Thunder) made first
proof of, of any other Sovereign Prince; then the Fur, the Ash, with
others, followed: And memorable is the Answer which one of the Royal Firres
made Petropolis, when she would have exacted a new Pecuniarie Duty of him;
and it was this: That he had received Life from his Parents, the Kingdom from
his People, and Religion from Petropolis, which if Petropolis desired, let her
'take it to her again.

Moreover, this great Arch-Flamin amusd the world, That he was endued with the
Spirit of infallibility, That he was a speaking Scripture; so that, Heresy
was defind to be nothing else all the world over, then an opinion in holy
things contrary to his decision. And easy it was to induce the Poplars to
believe this, who were allowd no other Books but Images; and taught besides,
That Ignorance was the Mother of Devotion; and that in praying, God Almighty
would understand them well enough, though they did not understand themselves,
nor the words wherein they prayed: And in such Orisons, how is it possible that
the heart and tongue should be Relatives?

But strange it seems to me, that He who is mounted to this high Office,
should be quite out of the reach of all Error, (for, commonly when one climbes
very high, his head is subject to turn) considering, how grossly ignorant
some of them were, that they understood not the Language of the Liturgy,
considering also what prodigious Vices reignd in some of them; And Vice,
Ignorance, and Error are commonly individual Mates, ushering in one another.

Their own Secretary, one that was best capable to know their intrinsique
Counsels, Practices, and Humors, has left upon record, That some of them made
way unto this more then humane Dignity, by Murder, others by Poison, many by
Simonie, some by the Sword, and one by tampring with ill Spirits; Adultery,
Incest, and Blasphemy, have branded some of them; Fornication held a
Peccadillo, and Pride became an inseparable companion to it: And one of the
cunningst sleights of the Devil, is, when he cannot fall one upon plain
ground, to lift him up with Pride. Which here grew so visible, that many
believe the power of the Ivy had been long since at an end, had not the
reputation and reverence the World bears to the humility and poverty of some
innocent Graffs, that creep up in holy Orders under him, borne out the
scandal of his Excesses: For it was plainly discovered, that whereas the Owl
was usd to build his Nest in the Ivy, Superstition and Error (which are also
Birds of Darkness) thrust him out, and took his room.

But of late years, that super-politique and irrefragable Society of the
Loyolists have proppd up the Ivy; so that all their consultations and study
tends to aggrandize him, to render him sole and supreme Lord of all the Earth:
And, as for the Spiritual Power they would hoyse him up to be the only Head;
so for the Temporal, they would also have one Lord Paramount. And because it
is most probable, to bring that mighty work to pass by the Olive, in regard
of his spacious Dominions; therefore, all their policy tends to exalt him:
insomuch, that of late years it is observd, of what Soil soever a Loyolist
is, he is half Factor for the Olive. And when at the beginning of the Tumults
in Leoncia, he was advisd to erect Citadels and Forts up and down, to keep
under his subjects, One of his then greatest Sages answered, It would far more
secure the Country, if the Societies of the Loyolists were multiplied for
their Convents would serve for Castles.

Profound Clerks they are, and the chiefest Court Rabbis, and the closest sort
of Intelligencers; for they have a way to scrue into the most inmost Closets of
Princes, and to go between the very Bark and the Tree; though many times they
prove Earewigs and Caterpillars to the tallest Trees. Nor do they make their
Mercuries ex quolibet ligno; for they never admit any Blocks into their
Society, but the best-timbred and choicest Plants, which they rear up for
such uses, as best suits and goes along with the grain of their Genius. And
though it be against their Canon, to receive Money for Alms; yet wheresoever
they plant, they presently grow up to an incredible increase of Wealth.

These Seraphicall Fathers do so under-value all other Orders, that they have
a saying:

The Church is the Soul of the World, the Clergy the Soul of the Church, and
they the Soul of the Clergy.

Amongst other points Petropolis holds, and these Loyolists with their maine
policy labor to uphold, one is, That whosoever they be, though they have the
same primitive Symbol and substance of Faith with her; yet if they grow not
within her enclosure, they are no other then Logges ordaind for Hellfire.
Which Opinion, though it carry with it an hot kind of Zeal, it has little
Charity, I am sure, with it: For, besides those Myriads of Plants which grow
up, and fall, under the Oak, the Fur, the Ash, and the Willowes, and are
thick set with Petropolitans in Rhenusium and Ampelona, with sundry other
Forests, which have long since shaken off the still-encroaching Ivy; that
vast Tract of Earth which Volgania contains, and those numberless multitudes
which are up and down Alcarona; nay, those which are in and about the holiest
of Cities, with that immense Region, which some hold to extend from one
Tropique to the other, Lorded over by Iochan Belul, who terms himself also
the Head of the Church, and Touchstone of sacred Truth, and Tree of Knowledge,
etc. (whom that great Clerk, and late Corrector of Times, would have to bear
another Name, but wrongfully) I say, that huge Territory, which this great
Monarch, with his Abuna, does possess; since all these bear the general
Character of Christians, and have the grounds and exercise of the Rites of true
Piety, though in diverse forms, it is an hard Censure, to judge that they are
naught else but Brushwood, prepared for eternal flames, and utterly incapable
to be made Timber for the enlarging of the Court of Heaven: But I believe this
Tenet proceeds from a kind of Policy, to serve only for Terror.

Let none mistake me, as if, while I treat of Trees, I should go about to make
poysond Arrows of them, to dart at Petropolis: No; I reverence her from my
very Soul, for the first ancient Mother Church: but it has been the practice
of the common Enemy, That where Truth erecteth her Church, he helps Error to
rear up a Chapel hard by.

I firmly subscribe, and submit my self to whatsoever was ordaind and acted
in her, the first four Centurie of years; for, nothing makes more for the
confirmation of my Faith, then her Doctrine and practice then.

For in those Ages, a great many of her blessed Arch-Flamins creeping lowly
upon the ground, yielded themselves to be made Bonefires, for the maintenance
of Truth; and out of their ashes, sprung up more and more innumerable holy
Plants, which did wonderfully propagate, and they were all endued with the
virtue of the Palm; the more they were oppressd and overset with the weight of
Persecution, the faster, stronger, and streighter they grew up.

In those days, the light of Divine Knowledge did stream from Petropolis, in
beams of Innocence, Simpleness, and Humility; but afterward ( helas) it
came to be offuscated and half choakd up with Fogges of humane Fancies.

Some presume to affirm, that if the Almighty would assume a visible externe
shape, it should be compounded of Light and Truth, they are so essential unto
him: Petropolis was once adornd with both these; but long since, the one has
been shrewdly dimmd, the other depravd, though neither quite extinguishd (as
some affirm in her.) So that I believe Druina had never forsaken Petropolis,
had Petropolis stood firm to her self, and not swervd from her first grounds.

But I find, that all the Devices and Crochets of new Inventions which crept
into her, tended either to enrich or enlarge the Ivy. The Bark of the Prime
Apostle was employed to Pyracie, and his Keys to unlock the Treasuries of
Princes; and where they could not do, the Sword should break them open. But
for his imaginary Exchequer, wherein were hoorded the redundancie of good
works, nothing must open that, but Keys of massy Gold; Arguments were turned
to Arms, and Miters to Helmets: which made the World, in stead of being
rectified, to run headlong into strange obliquities of Schism and Confusion.
As much, if not more affiance and conceit of comfort began to be had in them,
who once were sinners, and but yet supposed Saints, then in the Savior
himself: Vows and Orisons were made to them, that knew nothing of the heart;
and amongst such a number of petty Deities, God was half forgotten. Dignities
in Heaven, were disposd of on Earth; and to one of their Modern Saints, that
place is given, which Lucifer lost. And the blessedst of mortal Wights, that
ever breathd the Air of this lower Region, now questionless the highest Saint
in the Celestial Hierarchy, began to be so impertinently importund, that a
great part of Divine Liturgy was addressd solely to her, in such a way that
she questionless detests. They came so far in this point, that to make a
perfect Salve for a sick Soul, they held there must be a mixture and compound
made of Milk and Blood, and that they are both of equal virtue.

Traditions and the Ivies Decretalls were made of equal force, and as
authentical as the sacred Charter it self, and as much obliging the
Conscience; and his Commands observd with more terror, then those which were
delivered by the Voice of the Almighty, in Thunder and Lightning. It came to
pass, that it grew a common thing, for one to plant a Tree, and with one part
to heat his Oven, with the other to roast his Meat, and to make his God of the
third.

And whereas at the beginning, Man was made after Gods image, which must be
understood of the interne graces of the Soul, it grew a common practice, to
make God after man's image in externe gross corporeal shapes, whereas the
incomprehensible Majesty of the Almighty can neither be circumscribd in
place, nor represented in Picture, but darkely describd by an aggregation of
his Attributes.

And whereas He being a Spirit ought to be servd in spirit, and chiefly with
interne worship, and engraven only in the Tables of the heart, most of His
service came now to be externe in shows and representations, His Temples
being filled with certain kinds of Antique faces and great Puppets in every
corner; so that Petropolis became (as a little after her first foundation she
was) a mere Grove of Idols.

Moreover the mind was carried away with such a fond conceit, that Heaven, and
that eternal weight of glory which is reserved there for the Blessed, might be
over-merited by surplusage of works; Whereas there was never any proportion yet
twixt infinity and things finite; nor was this Earth ever held but an
indivisible point, and a thing of no dimension at all in respect of the
Heavens; and there should be always a kind of proportion twixt the work and
the reward.

Thus they thought to climb up to Heaven, upon the Tree of their own Merits,
whereas they should have observed that the Publican was bid to come down the
Tree, before Grace could descend upon him.

After this unlucky brood of errors, there crept in odd Philosophical
subtilties, and forced terms of Art, which did much puzzle Sacred Theology,
and threw as it were dirt in her face, with their classical distinctions,
cavills, quiddities, and so transformd her to a mere kind of sophistry and
logomachy.

Yet all this cannot deprive Petropolis of the Character of a true Church, (I
cannot say adverbially true ( and God is a lover of adverbs) she still has the
essential grounds, with the externe profession and exercise of saving
knowledge. Though Tares repullulat, there is Wheat still left in the Field,
the Foundation is good, though some odd Superstructures have been raisd upon
the first story; And he that pries into her with impartial eyes, will find
that she is not so corrupt in her positions, as in her practice, for many who
have been allured by her Books, have been averted again by her Churches,
and the sight of her ceremonies, and antique forms, which in some places are
such, that whereas Divinity should go clad like a Grave Venerable Matron, she
may be said to be accoutred rather like a Courtisane.

But some there are who do prosecute Petropolis with such a black
irreconcilable malice, that whatsoever has been once practiced in her,
though arbitrary and indifferent in it self, tending happily to decency and
externe Ornament only, they hold it to be flat Idolatry; They think they can
never fly far enough from her, whereby many of them striving to fly from
superstition fall into flat profaneness, holding this hatred of Petropolis to
be a point of holiness; so that they may be said to hate her Religion
rather, then the corruption which depraves it; Nay such is their malignancy in
this kind, that it extends to the very inanimat Creatures of Stone, Wood and
Glass, so far, that had they their wills, there should not a Roof, Wall or
Window stand which was once consecrated by Petropolis. And he was well servd
for his blind Zeal, who going to cut down an ancient white Hauthorne-Tree,
which because she budded before others, might be an occasion of Superstition,
had some of the prickles flew into his eye, and made him Monocular.

Yet for all the specious fruits of sanctity these Dotard Trees outwardly
bear, they are found commonly rotten at the heart, they are like putrified
Wood shinining in the dark; And their fruit like that which is said to grow
hard by the Sodomitique Lake, fair and goodly without, but hanled, crumbleth
to Ashes; So injurious they are to Prayer (being the very Marrow into which the
Soul melts in her Dovotion to Heaven) that the would thrust her out of her
own House (the Temple) at least give her a small room that may be (unless
she prove the extemporall issue of their own shallow brains) harrowed over
with such impertinent Tautologies, and bold Expostulations.

Such a deadly feud they have to hierarchy and degrees in holy Functions, that
they account those high Luminaries which from all times have been appointed
for the Guidance and Government of the Church, to be naught else but Comets, and
ill boding Stars.

In their Conventicles they do commonly bella cum personis magis, quam
peccatis gerere. Seldom do they give their Flocks any Milk, but strong
Meats; they still thunder out Lighning and Tempest, and the dreadful Curses
of the Law, which must needs whoorry many a poor Conscience upon dangerous
Rocks, and doubts, and fits of Despair, and seldom do they apply the sweet,
and Soule-solacing Lenitiffs of the Gospel, wherewith the corresives of the
Law should be tempered, whence it may be inferd, that they think oftener of
Hell then Heaven.

Add hereunto, that some of these great Santons will not stick to expound the
sacred Text, upon the warrant of their own private spirits, as if God
Almighty appeard to them out of a Bush; but hereby they usually work
themselves into some odd illumination of an egregious dotage: For they should
learn,

That in holy things, he that strikes upon the Anvill of his own Brain, is in
danger to have the sparkles fly into his Face, which must needs dazzle him:
nor is he unlike him, who lays together hot burning Coals with his naked
Fingers, in stead of a pair of Tongs.

I could wish, that these sciolous Zelotists had more Judgment joynd with
their Zeal, that they would not run away so far from their Text; it were
well, that they would suffer Reason to persuade them, before she invades them,
as commonly in Argument she does: That they had more of the spirit of
Conformity and Obedience, to the Constitutions and Commands of lawful
Authority; which commonly every ignorant and shallow mechanique spirit amongst
them, will presume to censure or demurre upon, and upon every trivial Cavil
raise Clamours. As in Itelia, where these fanatique spirits most swarm, not
long ago two of their greatest Clerks kept a mighty ado, Whether AARONS
Ephod was of Sea-greene, or Sky-colour: and this disturbd a while the whole
Assembly, there being hot abetters on both sides. And indeed, these
obstreperous Sceptiques are the greatest bane of Divinity, who are so full of
the spirit of Contradiction, that they raise daily new disputes, and multiply
Controversies, so that they are almost without number.

And if the Loyolists on the one side, and they on the other were quite grubd
up ( For they are but Brambles in the Lords Vinyard) or cut down (and there is
a strong warrant that every Tree which bears not good fruit should be cut
down) or that they were sent to plant in Vtopia, it were no great matter. For
with their extremes they blow the Bellows, and are the common Incendiaries of
all combustions wheresoever they come; For the One, they have it from their
first Planter who had been of the profession of blood; therefore they would
propagat Piety as Alcharona does hers, with the sword, and so make Religion to
be Gladij pedissequa, and which is worse, the Mantle, to palliat all their
designs, so that if one should pry narrowly into the carriage of their
actions, it would put him in mind of that damnable tenet of the Atheist, In
nomine Domini fit omne malum.

And between these two, the Western Church, yea, Faith her self, that sacred
Lady, does suffer as twixt two Malefactors, the one disturbing her peace, the
other depraving her doctrine; but the time will come that they shall be both
crushed to pieces, on both sides, and not a bone of hers broken.

But nothing is so natural to the humane Creature, and which he longs after,
and delights in more, then novelty and change, yea in holy things; And as long
as he is compounded of the four Elements, whose very being consists in
mutabilitie, his brain must still fluctuate with new fancies; As long as there
are diversity of Climes, whence the Celestial bodies send down their
influences, and make impressions upon the mind in different degrees of temper,
there must be various Idea's and conceptions of the Deity, as well as of all
other things; And as time does work a revolution in it self, so it does in
all sublunary matters; We grow weary of old things, of Moral and Politic
Laws, of the most exact and regularst Languages, of outward habits, yea the
inward habitudes are subject to this; nay Religion her self is not exempt, but
like the Moon has Eclipses, Changes and Spots; But as some Astronomers
affirm those Specks which are discerned in the body of the Moon to be causd,
by the shadowy reflections of Rocks and Mountains which are upon the surface
of the Earth; So the swelling vain conceits, that arise, and puff up the
mind, are the causes of such blemishes in Religion.

An undeniable principle it is, that there is but one Truth, and one Tracke
which leads to the right notion of the Almighty: And certainly He being a
Spirit and the most simple of essences, they approach nearest this Track, who
serve Him, as I said before, in Spirit and simplicity of thoughts, with the
least mixture of externe Rights and humane inventions: for as in Heraldry, it is
held a rule, that the plainer the Coat of Arms is, the more ancient it is: so
in the blazon of true Religion, the more simple and plain the form is, (yet I
always presuppose decency) the nearer it comes to the old Primitive times.

Therefore, that Religion which has least of the outward object, to avoid all
occasions of Idolatry, but worships the Godhead by a speculative act of the
Understanding, and goes directly to Himself: That Religion which derogates
from the Creature, and ascribes most glory to the Creator: That which
transferres not his Honor, (whereof he is most jealous) or mis-applyeth it to
any other: That which makes the poor peccant Soul rely only upon the Riches
of his Mercy, and so by a necessary recourse to enbosome and endeare her
self unto him; That Religion surely is most agreeable to the invisible and
omniscious God.

And my heart trembles, when I think how few there are of this, upon the
surface of the Earth: For, as one who had conversd far and near with the
Citizens of the world, does avouch, if the Globe of the Earth were divided into
thirty parts, they would hardly make up three parts of thirty.

But whither am I thus transported? I hope to be dispensd withal, for the
quality of the subject, which is the unum necessarium, which made me dwell so
long upon it. I should now post back to Druina; but that before I part with
Bombycina, I must needs salute the amorous Myrtle (and her Metropolis Adriana)
in regard she has been always a true Confederate to the Royal Oak.

A CHARACTER OF ADRIANA.
ANd here behold a thing of wonder, Adriana sited upon an assembly of Islands,
in the very jaws of Neptune: where being planted at the very first a Christian
(a prerogative she worthily vaunts of above all other) she has continued a
Virgin ever since, near upon twelve long Ages, under the same form and face
of Government, without any visible token, or least wrinckle of old Age.

The great Arch-Flamin espousd her once to Neptune; and a Prophecy there is,
That she shall continue a Virgin, until he forsakes her: and he, of late
years, is observd to shrink, and grow weaker about her, as if she had made
him over-labour himself too much upon her. And it is well known, no place
swimmes more in all manner of wanton pleasure; witness those multitudes of
Medlars which make their Beds, and are permitted to grow about the Myrtle, for
which she is so much spoken of all the world over.

Most renowned Adriana has been, for brave exploits up and down the World,
having wrestled with the greatest of Earthly Potentates; She re-establishd the
Eastern Cedar more then once, in his Throne; she restord the Ivy twice in his
holy Seat, being chasd out of Petropolis: which made the great Arch-Flamin of
late years to be foulely taxd of a kind of ingratitude, in offering to cause
her Armories to be defacd in his Court, having so well deservd of him: But it
is thought, since she expelld the Loyolists out of her Territories, Petropolis
has still a grudge to her, which lies yet indigested, and is in her like Lees
in the bottom of a Tub of Wine, which at the least stirring of the Vessel is
ready to rise up.

By the Charter of her Saint, she is to have in her Arsenall as many warlike
Vessels, as there be days in the year; and in the Summer season, as many in
course as there be hours in the natural day, to scour three hundred miles of
Sea, whereof she is Protectresse. And some kind of Vessels she has, which knew
not how to be beaten, until of late years that top of Druina's Cavaliers (one
that has spirit enough to actuate that goodly tall Bulk) receiving from them
some affronts, met with them handsomely, and bangd them to good purpose.

In that dangerous League, when most of the Occidentall Potentates were banded
against her, and in a manner conspird to sink her, she bore up above water,
against them all. But her custom has been, to piece the Lions skin with a
Fox tail, and so to supply the weakness of Force, by wiliness of Art, and
advantage of Treaty. And it is well known, how the Myrtle has taught the
Willowes of late years part of her Cunning; between whom, there is an
irrefragable Confederacy, to bayt Elaiana, and stop the further growth of
the Olive.

Amongst other things, Adriana is much cried up for, her rich Treasure is one,
which Elaiana has often attempted to exhaust: And one of her Ambassadors
desiring on a time to see it, seemd to slight it, in comparison of his great
Masters Treasure, which is perpetually growing, and has no bottom, as that
had: Which made one say, That Adriana, in relation to the four Elements, has
her City in Water, her Treasure in the Air, her Virtue in Fire, which makes
the Earth so to fly away from her.

True it is, that of late years the Myrtle has been at a stand, in improving
the Treasure of her Saint, since Elaiana has crossd the Equinoctial, and
found out a Track by Sea to Levantina; whence Adriana did use to receive, not
far from her own home, and dispense through all the Western world, those
aromatique and dainty Fruits the Indian Trees afford: but she gives out, that
the loss of that Trade is recompensed, by certain singular Immunities she
has through some of the Dominions of Alcarona: So that of late years she is
shrewdly suspected to be a Concubine to the huge Bramble, who has often loppd
her Myrtle, and cut off the only Regal Branch she had: And against him it
must be confessd, she is the greatest Rampart, and best Security all the
Western Princes have any where by Sea.

Thus the Myrtle flourishes still: And truly, a rare and wonderful thing it
is, that for so long a tract of Time, considering the violent storms that have
shaken her so often, she should still continue fresh, and without warping, or
any considerable change, or the least symptom of old Age, as I said before.
Whereas other Political Bodies, of a far greater Bulk, have met with their
Grand Climacterique, and received Changes, in a far shorter Revolution of
Time.

For Political Bodies, as well as Natural, have their degrees of Age,
Declinings and Periods; which I cannot so properly term Periods, as
Successions or Vicissitudes. Commonweals have often turned to Kingdoms, and
Realms have been cut out into Republiques; the ruin of one, being still the
raising of the other; as one foot cannot be lifted up, till the other be down:
Witness those four mighty Monarchies, which were as Spokes upon Fortunes
Wheel, or as so many Nails driving out one another.

And so is it also in Natural Bodies; the corruption of one, is still the
generation of another: so that, it seems, Nature has her Wheel also, as well
as Fortune; and these Changes and Chances, tend to preserve the whole from
decaying. So, that the opinion of that Adrianian, since much enrichd by a
Learned Druinian, is far from deserving to be exploded for a Paradox, viz.
That the Universe does not decay or impair at all in the whole, but in its
individuals and parts.

For, as the preservation of the World, is a continual Production; so in this
Production, as I said before, the corruption of one, fore-runnes the generation
of another: Therefore, to bear up the whole, if there be a decay in one place,
it is recompencd in some other: so that one may say, Nature danceth in a Circle,
and by this Circulation, preserves the visible World.

The Meteorologists observe, that amongst the four Elements, which are the
ingredients of all sublunarie Creatures, there is a notable kind of
correspondencie: the Fire, by condensation loses to the Air; the Air, by
rare-faction loses to the Fire; Water attenuated, becomes Air; Air
thickened, becomes Water; the Earth, by secret conveyances, lets in the Sea, and
sends it back fresh; her Bowels serving, as it were, for a Lymbique. So that
we see hereby, there is a punctual retribution, and a kind of mutual
compensation between them, which, doubtless, tends to the propagation and
increase of all compounded Bodies; amongst which, there is also a perpetual
and restless succession of Individuals, to keep the whole from failing. For,
as a Ship (as one made a very apposite comparison) riding at anchor, tosseth
and tumbleth up and down perpetually, yet cannot go beyond the length of the
Cable to which she is tied, and so in this turbulent motion shows a
constancy: so is it with the Universe, wherein all things hang by the Plummets
of Providence.

Therefore, I cannot subscribe to their speculation, that think the World has
been long since in a Hectique Fever, and so drawing on to a Consumption: That
neither Vegetable, Sensitive, nor Rational Creatures, are in that height of
perfection, as in former times: That Virtue shines not with so strong a luster:
That Invention is far shallower, and Age shorter: That the Modern World,
compard with the Ancient, is as a Dwarf upon a Giants shoulders, or as Noone
shadows compard to the Mornings.

I must confess, Antiquity is venerable; which makes us extenuate things
present, and extol things passd, and make it still the Burden of our Song,
Well fare the old Times; implying thereby, a palpable decay or dotage in all
things.

Yet we find, that the two great Luminaries of Heaven, and the rest of the
Celestial Bodies, have still the same virtue and operation, without the least
imaginary diminution; all Elementarie Bodies receive vigor and strength from
their influence.

Therefore I do not see, how the present can be so far inferior, in point
of perfection, to them of former Ages, considering the virtuall Causes remain
still in the same strength: and as for Invention, Wisdom, and Learning, I do
not see, but the second thoughts of latter Ages, may be as wise as those of
elder Times.

I know, the time must come, that Heaven and Earth shall pass away, and that
there will be a final Dissolution, though no Annihilation of the Matter, but a
destruction of the Old Form, and introduction of a New.

And of late years, some would be so foole-hardie, as to presume to be more of
the Cabinet Counsel of God Almighty, then the Angels themselves, (by whose
ministry, some say, he created the World) as to point at the precise Time of
this Dissolution: amongst other arguments, they fetch down one from Heaven it
self; which is, that the Polar Star, which is in the tail of the lesser
Bear, was in Ptolomey's time twelve Degrees from the Pole of the Equator; this
Star has insensibly still crept nearer the Pole, so that now it is but three
Degrees off, when it comes to touch or make the nearest approach that can be to
the Pole, which may well come to pass in 500 years; Nature her self, they
say, must expire, or some notable Period.

But I have been carried away too far by this Speculation, causd by Adriana;
which, of any Political Body, may be producd for an instance, against a
general decay, and impairing of the Modern World: Though some, which repine
at the Myrtles prosperity, say, That those stout and ventrous Trees, wherewith
she was usd to be fencd, are lately degenerated (in point of valor) to weak
Reeds, for their Pusillanimitie, and too much Caution, when they come to any
Warlike encounter.

And now it is high time for me to shake hands with Adriana, and Bombycina
also; whereof I must not forget to tell you, that the Olive now occupyeth four
parts of seven, if she were so divided: And to his Greatness, and the
apprehension of fears and jealousies they have, that he would fish in troubled
waters, may be ascribd the Concord and Calm of Bombycina's Princes; who, as
once the Mice would have hung a Bell at the Cats Neck, but after consultation,
could not agree who should venture first to put it on; would plot something
still against the Olive. Add hereunto, that besides this Peace, there is
plenty of Treasure, that comes to Bombycina by the Olive, who makes one of her
proudest Cities his Scale, for remitting his Moneys to Leoncia: But that
City, in respect of him, may be said to be as a Partridge under a Faulcons
wings; who can seize upon her at pleasure, but does not, for politic respects.

Bombycina was usd to be most under the Mulberry, the wisest of all Trees; for,
he never puts forth his Buds, till all the cold weather be passd: And so
indeed, the Plants Bombycina produces, are accounted the wisest, politiquest,
and most reserved and cautious of all other. It Is a Rule amongst them:

That he cannot be essentially wise, who opens all the Boxes of his Breast to
any.

They are, for the most part, of a speculative complexion; And he is accounted
little less then a fool, who is not melancholy once a day. They are only
bountiful to their betters, from whom they hope to receive a greater benefit:
To others, the Purse is closest shut, when the Mouth opens widest; nor are you
like to get a piece of Cake there, unless yours be known to be in the Oven.

Yet are they the greatest embracers of Pleasure, of any other upon Earth; and
they esteem of Pearls as Pebbles, so they may satisfy their gust, in point
of Pleasure or Revenge. Here you shall find Love and Hatred, Virtue and Vice,
Atheism and Religion, in their Extremes; for the greatest Wits depravd, are
the most dangerous; Corruption optimi, est pessima: Yet the Character one lately
gave of them, seems to savor too much of the Satyr: viz.

That the Bombycinian is unnatural in his Lust, irreconcilable in his Hatred,
and unfoordable in his thoughts; That with one breath, he blows hot and
cold; and to compass his own ends, he will light a Candle to the Devil.

I know, there is no Country, without her Nick.

As Ampelona, to be a great Bedlam.

Bombycina, a great Bordell.

Rhenusium, a huge Brew House.

Elaiana, Natures Sweating-Tub.

Druina, a Stage of Mimiques.

Lurana, a Fripperie of Bankrupts.

Monticolia, a Conventicle of Hills.

Cardenia, the Vrinall of the Planets.

And Itelia, the Suburbs of Hell, being situated lowest of any other upon the
Earthly Globe.

For my own particular, were I to associate with a stranger, I would single
out a Bombycinian before any other, for my conversation: for, of those twelve
several sorts of Forreners I have had occasion to converse withal, I never
knew any yet symbolizing so much with them of Druina, or complying more with
their humor.

OF THE ARRIVAL OF Prince ALTAPINVS in DRVINA.
But it is high time for me to return now to my Rhenusian Prince Altapinus,
newly arrivd in Druina upon a high design of love, and no less then to the
fairest branch of the Royal Oak, that Mirror of all perfections; The Itelians
and the old Fox of Ardennes, with Druinas greatest Arch-Flamin, did mainely
advance the work, together with the Princely Orange, and the Willowes; but the
Royal Fur of Elatena, and that great Queen from which she sprang, gave but
cold consent thereunto, and it was thought it lessened some part of her
natural affection toward her ever after. Yet Altapinus was admitted a Suitor,
and as he was in hot pursuit of this brave attempt of love, behold a most
mournful accident of fate intervenes; the fall of that brave Standell, which
should have immediately succeeded the Royal Oak, in all his Dominions; This
struck an Earthquake into all hearts for the present, which were affected with
various passions of grief, fear, amazement, and dark suspicions, that in
regard his fall was so immature and sudden, it could not be without some
sinister practice of violent means, nor can some be weaned from that conceit
to this day, imputing the cause of it to a precocitie of Spirit and valor in
him, and that therefore some infectious Southern Air did blast him. But this
is certain that there was intelligence of it in Elaianas Court amongst the
Luranian Loyolists a pretty while before his fall.

This incomparable Prince was so lamented, that all kind of Trees throughout
the whole Forest hung down their heads, and seemd to be turned to Cypresses
for the time, which being expird, the nuptials of Prince Altapinus were
consummated, and when the conjugall knot was a tying, the Princely Bride was
observd to be possessd with a sudden apprehension and eruptions of joy, which
as the iron decree of fate would have it, turned after into many pangs, God wot,
of anguish and sorrow.

For being but a few years settled in Rhenusium, during which time all the
neighboring Princes envied their high felicity; Behold the Cedar, by the
instigation of the Loyolists, fell out with the Homebians who had elected him
to be their King, provided that he would keep their privileges inviolable,
but they alleging he had infringed them, they would continue no longer under
the shelter of his boughs, but shook him off, tore his Seals, and resumd
liberty to choose another King.

Hereupon they made a proffer of their Crown (I cannot say it was the maiden
proffer) to Pr: Altapinus, who consulting upon it, though not so maturely, as
the disastrous events showed afterward, accepted it. Many there were which
animated him thereunto, and amongst other motives of incitement they usd, one
was, that if he had courage enough to adventure upon the fairest branch, and
sole of that kind of Druinas Royal Oak, he might very well venture upon a
Crown when it was tendered him.

Thus he went triumphantly to Homebia where he was inaugurated and crowned
king with many high expressions of joy and triumph.

About these times behold a fatal torch appeared in the Heavens, placed there
by the great Architect of the world, to forewarne Mortals of their miseries,
And the direfullst effects it produced were under that clime:

Those blazing lamps which in this latter age had appeared in the asterismes
of Cassiopaeia, the Serpent and Swan brought not forth such horrid events as
this in the VIRGIN sign.

It were to digress from the scope of this discourse, to make disquisition
whether these unusual lights be hospites or Indigenae, new-come guests or old
Inhabitants in Heaven, or whether they be mere meteorologicall impressions
not transcending the upper Region, or whether to be ranked amongst celestial
bodies; I leave the indagation of this high cause to the Disciples of Johannes
de sacro bosco of John of holy bush, it being not the subject of my Trees at
this time. But these hairie lamps have been noted to have been always the
fatal Vshers of calamity and alterations in states; And as upon earth
prodigious births portend no good, so these new engendered monsters above, point
always at some sad events to follow, either (...) or (...), wars,
pestilence, or famine, all which have most miserably raged through poor
Rhenusium ever since, and cease not to this very hour; and that with such
fury, that in many places the bed cannot privilege the sick, nor the cradle
the suckling, nor the great belly the Embryo, nor the Tribunal the Magistrate,
nor the Altar the Priest:

The chief grounds of all which, was imputed to this revolt of the Homebians,
from the Cedar. For the heavens bright eye had scarce run one whole carreere
through the Zodiake, but toward that season of greatest mirth throughout the
whole year, The Cedar had capitulated with the Elder, (who from that time
forward fell sick of the gall, (a disease incident to old trees) against
Altapinus, though he was the principal branch of his stock) to muster up
certain military forces to his use, for the expense of which service he
engaged part of his Country to him, with which forces, though fewer in number,
and tired with long marches, he suddenly assailed Altapinus his royal army,
and got the day. The Elder pursued his victory to the very walls, where
Altapinus with the Princely Carbasilis raignd, and being surpised were
constrained to fly in confusd manner with half bag and baggage.

Thus the Inconstant goddess turned her wheel about, and for this shadowy
Crown made him loose the substance, viz. his Princely inheritance, the brave
territories of Baccharia. Some there are which thought it much that Altapinus
appeard not himself in the field, the day of this battle, in regard his
newly worn Crown stood upon the fortune of it; And that having good store of
treasure in cash he suffered his Soldiers to be heartlesse, and ready to
mutiny for pay, most of that treasure falling afterward a booty to the enemy.

The unfortunate Altapinus traversing up and down Rhenusium came at last with
the Princely Carbasilis to Itelia, where the martial Orange well-comd her with
high demonstrations of joy, and his first congratulation was, that if she had
been the Masculine Plant, Homebias Crown had never been lost so slightly.

And good reason they had to be welcome to Itelia, for it is more than
conjecturd, that it was she who put Prince Altapinus upon this fatal enterprise
to advance her own ends. For the truce with Elaiana being then upon point of
expiring, she had no hope to draw Druinas Monarke, whose genius was so strongly
bent for peace, but by these means, into military engagements, that so part of
Elaianas strength might fall upon him: but Itelia reckond without her host in
this point.

For the first tidings being brought him of that undertaking, He calls his
sages together, and in a profound sense of sorrow, and a kind of propheticke
spirit (and the Oak of all other Trees is only fatidicall) told them, what a
fearful unfortunate business this would prove; And that the youngest there
amongst them should not see the end of it; which by sad experience has proud
too true, and yet continues. Moreover he was usd to say that the Homebians
made use of Altapinus, as the Fox did of the Catts foot to pull the Apple out
of the fire for his own eating: And from that day to his last, he disavowed the
Act, nor would he afford Altapinus the title of King, alleging that it would
be a dangerous president to justify the tumultuary uprisings of subjects in
that kind against their King.

And as this disastrous business begun with an ominous Comett, so there has
an ill planett, hung over it ever since, for scarce any enterprise has
prosperd in the procedure of it, but one calamity still usherd in another.
Finis unius mali, Gradus est futuri. As if some ill-boding Mandrake had been
found out, and grubd up in Baccharia, at the beginning of this fatal
undertaking. The Cedar having thus debelld the Homebians, to are the labells of
most of their ancient laws, made new ordinances, and put some of them to
exquisite torments, pretending that, that Crown belongd no more to him by
Election, but that he was their proprietary Liege Lord by Conquest. Nor did he
hold this to be an equal reparation for the indignity he had received by
Altapinus, but made his recourse to his Nephew the Olive, whom he partly
entreated as being the strongest of his stock (and therefore should be
sensible of the affront) and partly summond him as being Prince of the
Rhenusian Empire, and holding Leoncia and other territories in homage of him,
to assist him with some auxiliary forces, to vindicat this high disgrace, which
was done him by Altapinus.

Hereupon the Olive lent him his great Captain the Thorn, with the flower of
his forces in Leoncia, who shortly after invaded Baccharia (Altapinus his
ancient patrimony, and Carbafilis jointure) whereof he impatronizd himself
without scarce one stroke given; though at that time the Princes that were his
confederates, had in a ready martial equipage twice the number the Thorn had:
But it seems they all proved stupid unweldy blocks, and they colored their
cowardice with some presumptions they had, that Dolus versabatur in Generali;
that their chief leader was corrupted before hand with Elaianas gold. Thus
that great body of logges disbanded in part, yet some kept still together, as
shall be said hereafter.

The Cedar upon this new acquest, disengaged his own territory that he had
transmitted to the Elder, and gave him part of Baccharia for caution for his
disbursments; And to the Olive he transferrd the tenablest and strongest places
there to hold them as Commissary under him.

While these feats were a doing in Rhenusium, a hardy Cavalier, as he has
given notable proofs both at Sea and shore, was sent from Druina against the
Timauranians at the request of the royal Olive, and this was done by the
negotiation of Mordogan that notable engine of policy; And it was done of
purpose, as it appeard afterward, to weaken and divert the strength of Druina,
while the Thorn invaded, and seizd upon Baccharia.

This Cavalier complaind he was sent to fight with his arms tied behind him,
for his Commission being so strict ( and strength without Commission
sufficient, is like a match without fire) that could not meddle with any thing
upon the land, Elaiana also failing of that kind of supply she had promisd to
join to his, he could not do those exploits which might have bin atchievd
with such a power; yet his attempt before Galeri was brave, had the Heavens
continued propitious, and to speak the truth of any public expedition, Druina
made abroad ever since, this redounded least to her prejudice; For he met with
no passive encounter, at all, but was master of the Sea, and securd traficke
all the while; But as the foresaid attempt in Galeri road for fyring all kind
of bottomes wherein (her offensive strength only consists) was prevented and
dashed, by sudden still perpendicular cataracts of rain: so an Age since when
that restless Martialist Elaianas King and Emperor had an enterprise to
destroy Galeri, being in sight of shore, with a most powerful fleet, one of
her Flamins went upon a rock hard by, and after some kind of exorcising
speeches and postures, he took a long white wand, and struck the waves
thrice, And going thereupon to the Town, he encouraged the inhabitants
thereof with notable exaggerations of confidence, that they should be of good
cheer, for before night there should be Elaianians in Galeri market as cheap
as birds.

Hereupon the Heavens did suddenly change hue, and a most fearful tempest
fell, In so much that the Emperor himself escaped with extreme difficulty;
And it fell true that his Soldiers were sold by multitudes in Galeri's Bannier
toward the evening a little after the shipwreck.

I will not presume to pry into the secrets of the Almighty disposer of all
things whose hand-mayd nature is, how far he lets loose the reins to the
ill spirit of the air, to cause such sudden impressions upon the Elements,
whereof there are daily wonderful examples amongst this crew of Corsaries.

I know Philosophy and strength of art can do much, and by connection of
natural Agents and patients fittly applied can produce such effects that may
seem admirable to those that know not the cause; but for these extemporall
meteors, I believe it is beyond the reach of humane skill, unless the ill
spirit has a hand in it.

But what a foul shame is it, that one base Nest of Picaroons should confront
and daily damnifie all the Western World? Unless the dishonor thereof be
recompencd with this advantage, That the Voyaging Merchant sails with stronger
and better-built Vessels, which may serve the public upon occasion of Wars.

These times were very fatal to Favorites, both in Elaiana, Druina, and
Ampelona.

In Elaiana, that ancient Elm, which bore up that spacious Monarchy like
another Atlas, and servd as a mighty Prop to the Olive, and did what he would
in Petropolis for so many years, was removd from the Helm: but foreseeing
the storm which was like to fall upon him from the Secular power, he wisely
transformd himself into an Yew; and it is well known, what high prerogatives
the Yews have in Elaiana.

His eldest Graff succeeded him a while in Royal favor; but he quickly fell,
by the malignancie of great ones; the apprehension whereof, sunk so deep into
him, that it brought him to his last end. His brave old Sire hearing that, sent
him word a little before his fall; That he understood he was dying like a Fool
(of mere conceit;) for his own part, he feared no other enemies, but his
years.

In Druina also, that high-growne Tree, which had been long fosterd under the
indulgent branches of the Royal Oak, became enamord with the fair Consort of
one of the noblest Elmes in the whole Forest; who having continued some years
fruitless, and fearing a perpetual barrenness with him, articled against his
frigiditie, and so pleaded for a Divorce: He perceiving Majesty to appear in
it, made but cold opposition.

Hereupon it was referrd to the reverend Yews, to determine; and amongst them,
some gave their suffrage for a Nullitie.

A discreet Confident of that great Tree, (which came from a low Plant to be so
eminent) dissuading him from ingraffing upon another right, was taken as a
block out of the way, clapd in Prison, and afterward made away by Poison.

Hereupon He, with his new Consort, being after an exact Scrutinie, found by
the Sages of the Law to be privy to this black Act, were adjudgd to be struck
off by the stroke of Justice: but by the clemency of the Royal Oak (who
never quite forsook any whom he once favored) they were still permitted to
live; but for ever removd, from being any more so near, under the shadow of
his pure and Vice-detesting boughs.

And as in natural privations, there is no recession to habit, so is it
commonly in the favor of Princes; whence if one fall, he is never readmitted
into that fulness and strength of confidence and grace.

But the inferior instruments in this black Act, sufferd: Which gave occasion
to some Critiques abroad, to compare DRUINA'S Laws to them of SOLONS, that
were like Cobwebs, through which great Flies broke out, while the small ones
were entangled.

Nor did the first act of this, do any good to the honor of the Civil Laws
of Druina. Yet a notable piece of exemplarie Justice was acted upon the
Guardian of Druina's prime Fortress; who being found only privy to some of
these passages, was doomd to death, to the terror of others, for betraying that
high trust that belongs to that Office: And his death was the more remarkable,
because he confessed, that Heavens just judgment was fallen upon him; in
regard, that to restrain himself from Gaming, whereunto he was excessively
addicted, he made a solemn Vow, (which he often broke afterward) That if he
played any more, above such a value, he might suffer upon such a fatal Tree.

That nimble Eirenarch (so cried up by Reports) who then stood at the Helm of
the Law, wherein he was so active, that Druina's Monarch was usd to say, He was
like a Cat throw him which way you would, he would light on his feet: This
Iusticer proceeded with that acrimonie to cut down this (now pitied) great
Tree, with his high-descended Mate, and others, that of their sprigs he made a
Rod for himself; for ever after, he went always declining: which some held to
be a deserved judgment upon him, in regard he was often observd to insult upon
misery, and to loose a Life sooner then a Jest, when he sat upon the
Tribunal of Justice.

In Ampelona also, about this conjuncture of time, a politic Plant of
Bombicina's growth, being by the favor of that stately Tree, out of which the
now regnant Vine sprouted forth, made to overtop all the rest of the noble and
Princely Elmes in that Forest, was at the Gate of the Royal Court suddenly
felld, draggd up and down, his privatst parts lopped off, miserably chopp'd,
and the remainder of his body reducd to ashes, whereof part was hurld into the
air, part into the water, to extinguish the very memory of him. While this
Tragique act was a perpetrating, the general Cry about him, was Vivat Rex:
whereby was fulfilld the prediction of a Wizard, with whom he had tampred not
long before, touching the course of his fortunes; who told him, That in short
time they should be such, that he should be carried about the streets of
Tutelia with such a public acclamation of joy.

His Consort, an Enchantresse, as some would have her, ran the same destiny:
But that which made the world speak of it the more, was, that after he had
been thus, as a man would think, quite extinguishd, his Process was formed;
whereby he was found guilty of naught else, that I could learn, which was
actionable, but of Ambition, which like the Crocodile, never leaves growing;
and that being an exotique Plant, he went about to take too deep rooting in
AMPELONA.

The procedure of this business seemd very strange to the world, that the
Royal Vine, having already assumd the Character of JUST, should give way,
that such a horrid Tragedy should be acted in his own Royal Palace, (for
Palaces of Kings should be Sanctuaries) and that the Delinquent was not
proceeded against, by Legal form of Law, till after this violent Death, which
preceded the Sentence of Condemnation?

He that succeeded him in favor, did suddenly make such a flight, that from
vulgar Shrubs, he made himself, and two more which were nearest to him in
stock, to be rankd amongst the tallest Elmes in Ampelona: yet he fell also by a
kind of fatal destiny (Pestilentiall, though not so precipitate) in the first
heat of the Wars against the Eusebians, to which he had incited his Royal
Master.

What will become of Ramundas, who has the Vogue at present, in comparison of
whom, for transcendencie of height and continuance, the other two were but
Mushrumps; I will not undertake to divine: But observd it is, That the ground
whereon Favorites stand, is no where more slipperie, and fuller of Precipices,
then in AMPELONA: Which makes Ramundas to barricado himself with as much
policy and strength as may be devisd, against all shocks of Violence.

OF THE TREATY OF an Alliance with ELAIANA.
THe treaty of an alliance twixt Druina and Elaiana, (a piece long hammered
upon the Anvill of policy, and national wisdom) did now openly appear and
advance it self; To which end the Royal Oak, to remove all blocks that might
lie in the way, rid himself of those places he held in deposito of the
Itelians to prevent any request or proposition that should happily come that
way from Elaiana; And considering the daily expenses Druina was at, and the
vast sommes she was out upon them, and that most necessary dependency of
conservation and community of danger, that was and still must be twixt her and
Itelia, this Act was not such a great soloecisme in policy, as some Critics
would have it, who in regard they were the very keys of Itelia, and her
associated Groves, observd, that while Druina kept them in her hands, she was
more awed and respected by the Willowes then she has been since.

At the close of this business, the royal Oak did an act full of Majesty by
forbearing much of those huge sommes which might have been demanded; And it
was in recognition of those rich presents, Carbasilis receivd, when she passd
through the Willowes to Baccharia.

To negotiat this great business of alliance twixt Druina and Elaiana, Earl
Mordogan a shrewd complying Instrument, was employed, and going to have his
first audience, a piece of the royal palace fell under him which could be no
good omen.

Mordogan had studied the Genius of Druinas Monarke so exactly, that he seldom
departed from him with refusalls, he had such a rare faculty by facetious
ways to dispatch the most important affairs of state; He employed all his
art (and I believe his heart also went along) and left no stone unrolld to
bring this mighty work to pass; yet so unfortunate he was, that his
endeavors proved plausible neither in Druina nor Elaiana: But for my part, I
am clearly of opinion, that he really wishd well unto, and loved the Druinians
next to them of his own soil best of any other, and so much he protested
being arrested, by the iron mace of fate, a little after he had been designd
to return to Druina, when summond to his last end, it was no time for him to
boggle with the world; And the gracious Oak now regnant (to whom the Olive did
churlishly put over young Mordogan for a reward of the manifold services of his
dead sire) did not only resent his fall, but vindicat him from those
aspersions that were malevolently cast upon him to have always played with a
staff of two ends, the one of Olive, the other of Oak. Yet he received diverse
outrages in Druina, and one time when he had been rudely usd and assaulted as
he passd through the streets of Thamisond, and news thereof being posted,
though not by his means, to Elaianas Court, where the Royal Oak had then two
Sovereign Ministers representing himself, yet there was no violence at all
offered them or theirs; which made Elaiana take the advantage to arrogat to her
self more civility in this kind then Druina This causd him to say, that
Druinas bran was very course, but her flower wondrous fine; for the taller sort
of Trees who could look over into the true state of things, highly esteemd
him, though the poplars who see no further then the rind, contemnd and vilified
him, bringing him often upon the stage, and making him the common subject of
their pasquils, wherein he rather gloried, then grew discontented.

Amongst other facetious passages of Mordogan, I cannot omit one which happend
upon his last departure from Druina, At which time being magnificently feasted
by the chiefest Magistrate of Thamisond, In the midst of these jollities, he
askd leave to begin two healths; The first, was to the KING his Masters
mistress, The second to his Wife; the healths being gone round, he thus
expounded himself. That his great Masters mistress was Levantina, and none
are so fond of a Mistress, but if a friend has a private favor of her, he
will wink at it; and such was Levantina, who though she properly belongd to
his Master, yet he suffers the brave adventurers of Druina (whereof many were
there present) to have a bout with her, and he passes it by, and takes not
much exception at it; But his Masters Wife was Columbina whom he desired to
have wholly to himself, and therefore that none should meddle with her; (But
the Willowes of late have gone about to make him a notorious Cuckold, and have
had ready money to lie with her.)

Like to this was that, when a little after the going of Altapinus to Homebia
he was invited to a solemn meeting, where that flexanimous and golden toungd
Orator (then guardian of the Kings conscience) began the King of Homebias
health, he pleasantly pledged it, and passd it over, saying it was the first
time that ever he pledged the Cedars health in Druina.

For his opinion in holy things, he had a charitable conceit of Druina's
Religion, and seemd to slight many things in that of Petropolis, as will
appear by these few instances following. In a serious discourse once of holy
orders, when many things were canvasd pro and con, he said,

That he feared the same doom, and destiny attended the Loyolists that befell
in times passd, another great Religious order of Cavaliers, who were grown so
excessively rich, that they were utterly suppressed with a strange kind of
suddenness every where, and so became a common booty to their Princes. Guic.


Another time when that sappy and fruitful Tree (out of whose stock sprouted
that comely Elm which grevv so high under the branches of the Royal Oak, and
did flourish long in his sole favor) had such a vogue at Court, that she
hoisd up, and tumbled down some great Officers at pleasure, and that
extraordinary recourse was had to her for matters of grace, Earl Mordogan
dispatching a post to Elaiana, sent advise that there were never better hopes
of DRVINAS conversion to Petropolis then then, for they began to worship the
Mother more than the son.

Lastly, when that long flourishing Favorit in Elaiana, had fallen, and to
shelter himself from those storms which he foresaw, would thunder upon him
from the temporal power, did cover himself with a scarlet robe (the highest
of spiritual dignities) Mordogan was askd by Druinas Monarke, whether he had
sent for a benediction from his new elected Cardinal, He answered, There was
once in Elaiana one who had a Plum Tree in his Garden which was wind fallen,
and there being a statue made of the Trunk of this Tree and placed in the
Church for adoration, he was asked why he neglected to worship that statue as
he did others, He answered, that he knew that statue from a plant, and what
kind of fruit the Tree had borne, therefore he thought there was no adoration
expected from him.

Out of these instances you may infer that he was an Anti-Loyolist, and liked
not all things in Petropolis.

Nor was that noble Elm Count Sophronio whom Druinas Monarke employed to
Elaiana to this end, less dextrous and discreet, who although he was not so
nimble and Mercuriall as Mordogan, yet he rather exceeded him in solidity and a
high reach of understanding. He made a rare discovery of certain plants, that
were rotten at the heart, (yet daily servd about the Royal Oak) that were
devoted by pensionary obligations to the Olive. He went bravely attended to the
Cedar's Court, and so to the Eldars, with whom he was not behind hand. He
engagd his own argentry to make up a sum of treasure to preserve those
troops from disbanding, which were then in motion for the recovery of
Baccharia under CAMPANTHROPO, That admired Captain of his time, who was said
to make Soldiers spring up out of the very earth to follow him, though he had
not a cross to pay them salary; And although he had been put many times to
the foil and to extreme exigents, yet he never fell sans resource, but still
rallied his squandred squadrons, and made offensive head again, And most brave
was that Retrait (and honorable retrait is the difficultst thing in the feat
of arms) which he made, when by the point of the sword, he passed through
the very heart of Leoncia to his intended rendezvous, where he caused the
Thorn to burn his tents and raise the costly siege he had then a foot,
before one of the prime towns of the Itelians.

And this was the greatest cloud that ever fell upon the Thorn, since he
entered into Elaianas service, but he dispelld it not long after, and made his
honor to shine with a greater luster then ever, by taking in that Town
whereof the Orange was proprietary Lord, notwithstanding that the Oak, the
Vine, the Fur, and the Ash appeard, some more, some less in that action for
the Willowes.

Some say this sunk so deep into the Princely Orange, that it did accelerat his
fall, which happened not long after.

And he being gone, the Thorn wisely retired to Bombycina the Soil whence he
first sprung, fearing that fortune who being a Female loves Youth best, would
frown, and turn her back toward him now in his declining times.

There was a strong emulation twixt these two great Martialists, And the ORANGE
derogating one day from the THORN, because he was sprung out of a Merchants
stock, and consequently was not capable of competition with him who came of a
PRINCELY Extraction; He sent him word that it was a more glorious thing for a
Merchant to have command over Princes, then for a Prince to be commanded by
Merchants.

A brave quarter-giving Enemy the Thorn was, but the service of the Olive
(unless you throw into the Scales the high honor and fame he purchased
thereby) proud over precious to him, for he spent not only the vigor of his
days therein, but exhausted much of that great estate he brought with him so
far, that his own plants, some of them, are forced to subsist merely by
Pensions from Elaiana. But that which was worse being before a Town in
Bombycina near his own home, which he had so blockd up and stormd, as that he
had her as a Bird in a Cage, he was suddenly commanded by inexpected order from
Elaiana to raze his works, and raise the siege, notwithstanding that the War
continued longer; This they say he resented so deeply, that retyring to his
own natural Soil, he presently after fell. But it is no new trick in
policy, for diverting the least dishonor that should fall upon the State, to
destroy some Instruments, and make them Sacrifices for the public. This great
Captain had so highly deservd of the Olive (and Cedar also by taking in of
Baccharia) that his services seemd to transcend all reward; And by him one may
learn this lesson.

That supererogatory services, and too great benefits from Subjects to Kings
are of dangerous consequence, when they make the mind more capable of merit
then duty.

Those fearful Fires which were kindled through all parts of poor Rhenufium,
had now raged extremely, to quench which, the Royal Oak sent sundry of his
Noble Elmes in many costly legations from time to time, but good King, While he
labored for peace, they made themselves ready for battle.

And herein the Cedar proved very ungrateful to him, considering the
fairness of his proceedings; And touching the Elder, what could be expected
from him but knotty and crooked hollowhearted dealings? Yet by his high credit
with the Olive, he often asswagd the fury of those conflagrations, by
suspension of Arms and cessation of all acts of hostility, and preservd
Baccharia a long time from invading; And he proceeded so far by treaty, that
he was profferd to have the Imperial Ban taken off, of Altapinus upon his
conformity to a submission, that so he might be rendered capable to treat, and
travel through Rhenusium; to have also an entire surrender made of his
possessions to his Eldest Graff, which should be affianced to one of the Cedars
branches, and in the interim to be brought up in Druina's Court. Moreover he
should be restored to his Dignity after that old decayed Elder should fall,
upon whom the said Dignity had been in a shuffling imperfect manner conferrd,
yet with this proviso, that the next Heir should not be prejudiced.

These propositions being sent to ALTAPINVS, he replied, that whereas the
adverse party, requird a Personal submission, and that this should precede all
other things, by natural order usd in like cases, the restitution of his
Country which was a thing material should go before, and then the other which
is but a point of Ceremony, should follow; And whereas he had already complied
with the Cedar to sign an Instrument for the conditional resignation of the
Crown of Homebia, and done other acts of Conformity, and no performance at all
on the Cedars side; If these intentions of his were real, the said submission
might be done as well by a Deputy.

PRINCE ROCALINO'S Journey to ELAIANA.
WHile matters were thus in hot agitation, and no particular assurances yet
had, and because that commonly Dolus versatus in universalibus, the Royal Oak
sent a choice confident to Elaiana's Court (for there was the mill where these
matters were a grinding) to know the truth, and reality of things, who having
boldly acquitted himself of his charge, and brought advise that matters were
still involved in generals, Behold a most rare adventure, Prince Rocalino,
with Villerio, and two discreet confidents well versd in the Olives Court,
post away in private disguise to Elaiana, traversing the whole diameter of
Ampelona, where Rocalino came in so favorable a conjuncture of time, that he
saw the splendour of the Ampelonian Court in a set stately shevve, where among
other rarities, he beheld one of Natures choicest pieces, the Princess
Aretine, sparckling like a constellation amongst the rest, in moving measures.

Little thought he then, that she was predestined for him, by the high hand of
heaven where all marriages are made;

But humane eyes cannot see beyond their horizon, they cannot discern future
contingencies, and in the conduct of worldly actions, what we desire or dread
seldom directly falls out, but something intervenes and concludes we least
thought of, and if what we expect do happen, they come not many times till
after the search, which shows that there is a supernatural alldisposing
power above; Wherefore it is not safe for our minds to stay at second causes,
for this may induce a forgetfulness of the first, but we must pass higher,
and by a speculative act of the understanding observe the disposition,
dependency and subordination of causes to the high will of providence, and then
we will confess with the Poet, that the chief link of natures chain is tied
to the foot of Jupiters chair.

From Ampelona's Court Rocalino flew upon the wings of love toward Elaiana,
and it was in the beginning of that season, that the Lady Flora uses to cloth
our Grandame Earth, with a new livery diapred with various flovvers, and
chequerd with all delightful objects; a season that was usd to be no less
proper, than propitious to lovers. The pretty songsters of the spring with
their various notes did seem to welcome him as he passd, the woods put forth
their blossoms, the earth her Primeroses and daiseyes to behold him, the air
blew with gentle Zephires. But in the Heavens it was observed there was an
inauspicious conjunction between Jupiter and Saturn that dull and malevolent
planet.

Rocalino being come with no less difficulty then danger to the O^ives royal
Court, the first thing he did was to dispatch a post presently to Druina to
carry news of his safe arrival there. That night and next day after there
were dark whispers up and down, but toward the evening Villerio went
privately to the royal palace where he had audience, and whence Chenandra the
sole ingrosser of the Olives favor, did accompany him back to welcome
Prince Rocalino, who magnifying that brave journey, and discovering wonderful
motions of joy,

He said the Olive and the Oak should part the world between them, and that
it should be a match presently, for he doubted not but he came thither to be
of their Religion; whereunto answer being made, that he came not thither for
Religion, but for a Wife; Chenandra replied short, that there must be then a
dispensation procurd from Petropolis.

That night Elaianas Monark himself came to congratulate Prince Rocalino to
Sophronio's dwelling, but he met him half way, and with much complement and
mutual embraces parted for that time.

The next day he brought forth in a solemn stately kind of march the LADY
AMIRA (the jewel which should have been the prize and guerdon of that
heroicke adventure) to be seen of purpose by Rocalino in transitu; But it
being divulgd abroad it was Prince Rocalino that was come, all were transformd
into a kind of amazement, which broake out after into incredible acclamations
of gladness, every one extolling to the very stars, the bravery of the
action, And the general vote was, that it were great pity but the Lady Amira
though she were a goddess, should be thrown into his arms that very night,
he had so well deservd every inch of her; They said further that all the
Angels in Heaven came along with him, for the Country having extremely
suffered by a long unusual drowth, upon his coming there fell down most
wholesome fructifying showers, wherein it was said, the Earth drank healths to
congratulate his coming thither.

The next morning the Royal Olive sent some prime Elmes to attend Prince
Rocalino in quality of Officers of state, and a little after he was brought to
the royal palace in the same state Elaiana's Kings use to be attended the day
of their Coronation. The Royal Olive himself accompanied him, with all the
flower of his Court, and always from that day to the very last he stayed
there, he gave him still the precedence, transmitting to him all petitions and
matters of grace; multitudes of prisoners were releasd, and indeed there wanted
nothing that might be added to the very height of all externe honor and
ceremony.

But let us look a little into the interior carriage of the maine business,
and there you shall find that, Quercus connubium, connubia tractat Oliva.

When Rocalino arrivd, matters were brought to that perfection by the strenuous
negotiation of Sophronio, that there wanted nothing for the consummation of all
things, but a dispensation from Petropolis, which at last came, and before that
time Rocalino was not admitted to speak with the La: Amira in quality of a
Suitor, but a Prince; Now the said dispensation came cloggd with an unhappy
inexpected clause, thrust in of purpose, as it appeard, to retard the procedure
of things, which was, that whereas there were Certain Articles condescended
unto by Druina's Monarke in favor of the Petropolitans that were in that
kingdom, and other Crowns under his dominion, the great Archflamin' demanded
caution for the performance of them; The Royal Oak answered, that he could
give no other caution then his word and oath, and Rocalino should do the like,
which should be confirmd by his Counsel of state and exemplified under Druinas
broad Seal; but this would not satisfy unless some Petropolitan Sovereign
Prince would engage himself for them.

Hereupon all matters were like to go off the hinges, and a buzze went out,
that Rocalino intended to get away covertly.

In these traverses Chenandra steps forth, and said there were three ways to
conclude this business; two good, and one bad; The first good way was, that
Prince Rocalino should become a Petropolitan.

The second was, that as Elaiana was obliged to him for his free coming
thither, so She might as freely deliver him the LADY AMIRA, trusting him
without further conditions.

The ill way was, not to trust Rocalino at all with any thing, but bind him as
fast as they could.

While matters were thus a canvasing, and gathering ill blood, Elaianas King
steppd out, and profferd to engage himself by oath, for the satisfaction of
the great Archflamin, but with this proviso, that he must first consult with
his ghostly fathers, whether he might do it Salva conscientia or no. Hereupon
the business was referrd to a comittee of the learned Yewes; and the state
of the question was,

Whether the Olive might with safety of conscience take an oath in behalf of
Druinas Monarke, and Rocalino, for performance of such and such Articles that
were agreed upon in favor of the Petropolitans, throughout the kingdoms of
the Royal Oak.

This assembly long demurrd and dwelt upon the question, and after a long
protraction of time, they concluded at last affirmatively; And in case the Oak
faild to execute what was stipulated, the Olive was to vindicate his Oath, and
right himself by the sword.

This difficulty being surmounted, there was exceeding great joy, and all the
Capitulations were interchangeably sworn unto both by the Oak and Olive, and
as Chenandra said in Elaiana, so the Royal Oak himself was so confident, that
he said;

All the devils in hell could not now break the match; whereunto a blunt
facetious Knight being by, answered, that there was never a devil now left in
hell, for they were all gone to ELAIANA to help to make up the match.

But matters being scrued up to this height, the great Archflamin, as heaven
would have it, f^ll; Upon which tidings the Royal Olive came to Prince
Rocalino and told him that he had receivd very ill news, which was, that the
holy Sire, who was so great a friend to the intended alliance (who had formerly
writ unto, and sent to visit Prince Rocalino) was taken away by the hand of
fate, and in regard there was yet no contract but a treaty only a foot, he
could not proceed further in this business without a ratification of the
former license by Melissanus the newly chosen Archflamin, which by reason of
his indisposition of health, and the large distance of place, could not be
dispatchd with that celerity that was wishd: But now that his highness was
pleased to stay so many years for a wife, might well stay a few months longer,
and he would undertake to negotiat and procure that dispatch from Petropolis
with all the expedition that might be; And if he pleased to give way that the
La: Amira's journey to Druina might be deferred, until the next ensuing spring,
he would give him a blanke to write his own conditions, touching the surrendry
of Baccharia, which might recompense his so long stay: Prince Rocalino upon
this answered, that he was infinitely bound to his Majesty for all those
transcendent favors he had receivd since his arrival to his Court, and the
reasons that inducd him to undertake so hazardous a journey were two; One to
streigthen the league of amity with his Majesty in his own person; the other
was, to give the world a greater testimony of his love to the Lady Amira to
whom he had already transmitted his best affections; And he had thought the
Sovereign Agents of his Royal sire, had brought matters to that ripeness,
that he needed not to have come thither to treat of a marriage, but to fetch
home a Wife; Now since his Majesty alleadgd that the late holy Archflamin bring
go^e, he cannot proceed further without the approbation of Melissanus the
newly Elect, he desird him to consider that if his Majesty had a spiritual
sire to comply withal, he had a natural sire to obey, which was DRUINAS
Royal Oak, whose top being already periwiggd with snowy age, was sickly and
impotent and subject to many indispositions, therefore he feared that he being
his sole Masculin plant, and the staff and comfort of his age, it had already
wrought some ill impressions in him, that he wanted him so long beyond the
proposed time. Besides the eyes of all DRUINA were fixed upon him, and he
being their next succeeding hopes, this his so long absence might produce ill
effects, and dangerous consequences of state at home; Add hereunto that there
was a Royal fleet already floating on the Seas for his transfretation, and the
season, if he retarded his voyage any longer, would grow rough and dangerous.
Moreover his Majesty was not ignorant, that the Capitulations which his Royal
Sire had signd and sworn unto, and were confirmd by his Counsel of state,
were done with this proviso, that if he be not returned in Druina by such a
time, all that was passd should be pro non facto.

The Olive hearing this, stood a while at a stand, and after said, Since his
Highness had pressd the necessity of his departure with such pregnant reasons;
if he feared any commotion in Druina, by reason of any thing that might reflect
upon these proceedings, he would send an army with him of purpose; And since
matters were so, his Highness might think fit to leave a substitutive power,
with whom he pleased to be contracted to the La: Amira, which should be
precisely done ten days after the confirmation should come from Petropolis;
And if he pleased to repose that trust in him, he would faithfully discharge
it, and esteem it a singular favor, and then he might send when, and whom
he pleased for her, for ever after she should be at his disposing.

Prince Rocalino replied, That touching his first proposition, for an army to
go with him, the remedy would be far worse than the disease, though there
should be tumults in Druina;

For the second, he made semblance to be mightily taken with it, saying, that
of all the Grandezas he had received since his coming to his Royal Court,
this surmounted all the rest, therefore he would leave a power behind in
Sophronio's hands, to that end.

This being done, Rocalino without the least ombrage of coffeehouse,
prepares for his journey back, leaving behind him Gemmes of invaluable
esteem, and such as was confessd, never to have been seen the like in that
Court, as presents for the Lady Amira, which were, I cannot deny, very
honorably returned by Elaiana after the rupture of the treaty, and public
declaration of war.

The Olive himself with the rest of the royal stem, accompanied him a days
journey of, and never were seen streighter embracements, and outward arguments
of love and reiterated endearements between any, then between the Olive and
Rocalino at their departure.

But Villerio and Chenandra parted not so lovingly, Villerio telling him, That
he acknowledged himself unmeasurably obligd, to the royal Majesty of the
Olive, and the rest of the Princely branches in an eternal tie of gratitude,
and that therefore he would mainly endeavor in what in him lay, to nourish and
strengthen still the peace twixt the dominions and subjects of both Crowns,
But for your self Count Chenandra, you have so many ways disobliged me, that
I cannot make any profession of future friendship to you without flattery;
Chenandra answered very short, that h^e accepted of what he had said, and so
they parted.

Prince Rocalino taking his leave of the Lady Amira, was desird by her to see a
Vestall Saint in his way as he passd, who was then cried up for miracles; In
some divine exercises she was reported to be often lifted up in the air, and
appear as fresh as a rose, though she was so furrowd with age, that she lookd
like a spirit kept in a bag by some conjurer.

But he coming thither, and she mingling discourse with him a long time, the
substance whereof was for the most part, that he should be good to the
Petropolitans in Druina, and to bestow an alme amongst her poor vestall
sisters, there could no elevations be discernd, or any sudden changes at all in
her, or any other miraculous feats, though she could have never showed them in
better company. Prince Rocalino being conveniently attended to the Sea side,
and with extreme hazard embarkd, a private instrument was dispatchd in his
name to Elaianas Court with instructions to Sophronio to stay the delivery of
the proxy, till further directions from him; But these instructions were not to
be delivered until the Ratification had come from Petropolis.

In the interim great preparations were made against the celebration of the
nuptials, The Lady Amira applied her self daily to learn Druinas language,
the Sovereign Ministers which represented the person of Druinas Monarke,
carried themselves rather like subjects toward her, then Ambassadors; Many
rich accoustrements and presents she had provided for Prince Rocalino, Her
family was assignd her, her officers distinguishd, And (which weighs much
with me, for the reality of the thing) Sophronio had provided a great number of
brave liveries for his attendants, as rich as any that ever were worn in that
Court, and matters were cried up with such a certitude, that the mart went
twenty to one, the business would take.

At last the Ratification came plenary, and absolute from Petropolis, but a
cunning rumor went out, it had come some weeks before, upon which the private
instructions which were sent in Prince Rocalino's name were anticipated by
Sophronio, who while he remaind anxious and fearful to prefer a private
order to the prejudice of the high Commission of Druina's Monarke under the
greatest seal, which none can countermaund or suspend but the same power that
give's it, he proceeded still until new instructions came from the Royal Oak
himself to stay the delivery of the said proxy;

And that whereas before he treated singly of a match, he should now join the
Restitution of Baccharia with it, for he would not marry Rocalino in joy, and
leave Carbasilis in tears.

Sophronio soliciting the royal Olive upon the new Commission, and not
receiving a satisfactory positive answer, had order to depart that Court, and
so all was dashd to pieces.

Whence I learn, that in political affairs, as well as mechanical, it is
far easier to pull down, then build up; for that structure which was above
ten summers a building, and that by no mean Artists, was destroyed in a
moment.

And the world adjudged Elaiana to be well apayed for the hard measure she had
offered Prince Rocalino, to tantalize him so long with dilatory hopes, and let
him return at last without his errand: For upon the very point, when the
business should have been consummated, and the Lady Amira tendered, the motion
may be said to have been rejected as it were by Druina.

Many obstacles concurrd to hinder this great work.

The maine of all, difference in Religion; for so simple and blockish were they
of Elaiana, that the common voice was, Prince Rocalino came thither to make
himself a Christian; And happy had it been for that business, if he had
never lodgd in the Royal Palace, but had taken one of his own, wherein
Druinas liturgy, and the rites of her Church might have openly appeard to
unbeguile those silly wretches.

The clashings twixt Villerio, Sophronio, and Chenandra, who opposd it as long
as it was safe for him, the exceptions that were taken at Villerios Commission.

But pity it was, that the intendments of Sovereign Princes, specially such
an action as that, which concernd the incolumity and peace of all the Western
world, the quenching of those fires in Rhenusium, the reinvesting of Carbasilis
in Baccharia, which as it was then given out, should be redelivered at the
instance of the Lady Amira after the Match, to ingratiat her self thereby the
more to the Druinians, besides a mighty advantage of commerce, for no Country
is able to do DRUINA more good and less hurt then Elaiana; I say what pity it
was, that all this should be frustrated by private passions and interests.

Another rub in the way, was the disaffection of those Ministers that were sent
last to Druina to finish all things, especially one of them, and he the
chiefest, whose heart did not go along with the business.

It was also discovered that the Luranians (of whom multitudes subsist by the
Olive, who if the business had taken effect had been dismissed, and that
Crown disburdened of those Pensions they received, but they preferring to
stick there rather to a certainty, then to seek new fortunes, and begin the
world again in their own Soil) did no good offices in the conduct of this
business.

Besides 'twas thought the Ampelonian, and the Myrtles Ambassadors, with others
there Resident, were not idle.

Furthermore it had been wished that some had had more Discretion joynd with
their Zeal to this great business, which should have made them more cautious
and reservd in their speeches and behavior, and complied better with the
humor of the Elaianians, against who^ and the poverty of that country, they
would openly inveigh and gibe at, even in the Royal Palace.

Some said, if they had left an eye behind them in Elaiana, they would not
come thither to fetch it again; Others, that they would never return thither
unless it were to Conquer her; Others, that they would never see her again
unless twere in a Map; Others would say, they thought there was no
Resurrection out of her ground.

Which puts me in mind of that boisterous Buffon, who said in the Royal
presence of Elaianas Monarque, that his Master was nearest and likest to God
Almighty of any King upon Earth, and being asked why? He answered that God
Almighty had but only one Son, and He was sent to be Crucified by Jews;
And Druinas King also having but one, he sent him to be crucified by
Elaianians.

But for Rocalino himself, as Elaiana rings of the renown of that heroique
Enterprise, and will do, to all Posterity, so to this day his memory and
fame is fresh in that Court, for his sage and Princely comportment, mixd with
such a becoming gravitie, that it suited with the very genius of that Nation,
where a Prince without gravitie, is said to be like a Peacock without a Tail.
Whence it may be inferrd, that though the maine business took not (which
continues a dark kind of riddle to this day) yet Rocalino gaind much in point
of honor, besides the mighty experience ( which is the great Looking-glass of
Wisdom) he purchased thereby.

Never was Lady so gallantly courted, no not Daphne her self (whom the amorous
god converted to a Laurel) was wooed with that braverie, and strength of
affection, which was showed with that fervor, that Elaiana very poorly made
use of it, to gain time and get stricter conditions; for as I heard one of
them say, Love is like a P^^^e of Charcole, which meeting with the wind its
contrary, makes it turn more ardent; Or like a rapid torrent which jusling
against a damme swells higher; so love meeting with opposition grows hotter
and stronger.

But a most unworthy thing it was, and which all the world cried out at, to
make this his heat of love, and coming thither, two acts which should have
accelerated the business, to turn to his disadvantage. But it has thriven
with them accordingly, for it is observd that their affairs up and down the
world ever since have thriven but very odly.

After his departure it was disputed pro and con, whether that affection
whereof he had showed such brave testimonies, was real or no; howsoever it was
granted by both sides, that Rocalino had purchased a high opinion of honor by
it; for if it was real, he showed himself to be a great master of his
affections, that he could check and call them home so soon; If it was
otherwise, it discovered a high point of wisdom, to act the part of an
Amorist so lively and pathetically* Had that blind Greek, one of the Muses
first Priests, bin contemporarie to this heroique adventure, how proud had he
been of so sublime a subject to heighten his fancy, a subject indeed
adaequate to Apollo himself and his whole quire of Daughters; And I cannot
wonder enough, that none all this while to whom Ex meliore luto finxit
praecordia Titan, have not employed their Talent to this task, considering the
rareness, and richness of the matter.

But to resume my discourse, Sophronio having received that foresaid new
command from the Royal Oak, went to propound the entire and speedy surrender
of Baccharia.

The OLIVE answered, that if a treaty would be commencd with the Cedar, who
was now Lord of it, and He, with the Elder, (but his Commisioners,) if he
came not to terms of conformity, he would join arms with Druina to recover
it, and for caution hereof he would engage that rich City whither his fleet
of treasure arrives yearly.

But this not satisfying, he went to take his leave of Elaianas King, who had
commanded Chenandra a little before to tell him in his name, that he had
receivd advise of his Revocation, and understood also by diverse
advertisements, what clouds were engendring in Druinas Court, and in regard the
envy which was drawn upon him proceeded from the labors and endeavors he
had employed to finish the match, therefore he would hold himself much touchd
in honor, if for this cause any should so prevail against him as to cause his
ruin or disgrace. Therefore he would write to Druina's King, and send a
particular Ambassador, if need requird, to represent the true state of things,
in regard that Sophronio had servd him with that exactness of fidelity which
was well known to the world, and to Elaiana, in particular, that it deservd
not only to be assisted with all good offices, but it was fit to be rewarded,
and published; And that the Royal Olive for the example of his own subjects,
and encouragement of those that did or hereafter should serve other Princes
with that punctuality as Sophronio had done, had commanded him to offer him a
blanke signd by the Royal Olive himself, wherein he might set down his own
conditions, both in point of title and fortune; And this he did in no way to
oblige another Prince his subject, but only as an encouragement to honest and
faithful proceedings, and therefore he would not make these offers in private
but justifiable to the world, and would accompany all he should do, with a
declaration, that this he had done, was for the service he had done his own
Master.

Sophronio replied, that he was much afflicted to hear such language; and that
he desird it might be known and understood, that Elaiana was not any way
beholden to him, for what ever he had done, he did it, for that he thought it
fittest, for his Masters service and his own honor, without having any
relation to Elaiana; And that he servd a Master from whom he was assurd of
justice and due reward: And for those who were thought his enemies, he knew
their power to be great, but he servd so just a Master, that he doubted not,
but his innocence would prevail against any wrong, they should intend him; And
though his own integrity would not give him leave to apprehend any kind of
danger or disfavour from his said Master, and were he assured to run into
eminent danger, yet would he rather go home to cast himself at his feet for
mercy, and thereby comply with the duty and honor of a faithful servant, then
to be the greatest of Elaianas Princes.

So I leave this mighty business for a Riddle (as I said before) both to the
present and all future ages; For the books of Kings are written in dark
Characters which few can uncypher, and their Actions like deep foords, wherein
Elephants may only swim; Or as great Rivers, whereof we see the course of the
stream, but know not the source.

So I leave also Sophronio preparing for his journey, and inexpressible it is,
what a black kind of obstupefaction, and regret all the world was possesd
withal in Elaianas Court, specially the La: Amira, who, we thought, would
have turned into one of the Heliades (those amber weeping-trees) for sorrow.
Many arguments of a real love appeard from her toward Rocalino, amongst
others one was, that she caused many divine duties to be performed for his
safety in his return to Druina; where being landed he fell down and kissd the
very earth for joy; And being come to Thamisond, one would have thought that
huge body composd of such numberless pieces had been all one fire, and turned
to one flame from those huge piles of sacrifices of universal joy,
notwithstanding those huge cataracts of water that powrd down from the
meteors; But greater far, and more ardent were those inward flames of
gladness, wherewith all hearts did burn and sparkle to see their Rocalino
again. All mouths were full with Oken leafs and in the Wood so wide, etc. with
other such songs and catches of airie mirth; The very inanimat creatures as
steeples and walls, did shake with joy, yea the very pavements and channels
pledgd healths for this happy return.

Amongst other foreign congratulations which came from far and near,
CARBASILIS suddenly sent, but with this Complement,

That next to the hand of divine providence, he might thank her, and her
numerous graffs, that he came so safely and freely back, so that I cannot but
deride their shallowness, and poverty of judgment, who think Elaiana had any
design to detain him there.

The Royal Oak summond hereupon a general assembly, wherein by the relations
of Villerio (and indeed he for his own particular had little reason to love
Elaiana ever after for some disrespects that had passd,) the two treaties,
touching the alliance with Elaiana, and restitution of Baccharia were quite
dissolvd by the unanimous vote of that great Assembly, not one dissenting from
it, which made his Majesty say, That he thought they were led by one spirit,
as the seventy Interpreters.

And nothing could be more pleasing to the Druinians then the rupture of these
treaties, as the case then stood, for they were extremely nettled to see the
Princely standell of their Royal Oak return from Elaiana with a branch of
willowes.

Nor indeed did the poplars and coppices and vulgar sort of Druinas Trees,
specially Thamisond, ever affect this match, for they were transported with
such a reasonlesse averseness to it, that whosoever did speak but in favor
of it, or discoverd any good wishes to it, he was presently held a
Petropolitan, and to have swallowed a leaf of the Ivy.

The Petropolitans throughout all Druina were exceedingly dejected and
crest-fallen at these proceedings, and that matters went so cross in Elaiana;
And as it was observed to be an ill favored augury, that a piece of the royal
tarrasse fell under Mordogan at his first audience, when he came Hoc agere,
when the treaty of alliance begun to be in serious agitation; so a little
before this dissolution of it, another fatal accident, or rather tragique
presage fell out in Thamisond: For as the Petropolitans were in midst of divine
exercise, and some say inveighing against the Eusebians, the Oratory suddenly
tumbled down, so that a great number of them were quashd to death by the very
inanimat creatures of stones and rubbish to the consternation of all the world.

And this happened when they were a gogge and building of Castles in the air,
and at the height of their hopes, that by virtue of the said alliance, they
should have a kind of liberty of conscience equal to a Toleration.

The Royal Oak following the advice of the foresaid great Counsel prepared
for a war, which quite turned the match, to powder; Mars thrusts Hymen out of
doors, and Ianus gates flew wide open; Then which nothing could be more
thwarting and opposite, the one to his disposition, the other to his desires
which had been so vehemently carried that way for many years;

They promised to make him belovd at home, and feared abroad as much as any
Prince that was, to which end they gave him round sommes of moneys; A
polemicall Counsel was erected for the conduct of the martial affairs, and
by the gracious condescent of Majesty they were to dispose of the pecuniary
levies that were made to that end.

As matters were reducd to this pass, behold a notable piece of
machiavillianisme, formd and complotted against Villerio by the Sovereign
Ministers Elaiana had then in Thamisond; who in a private audience they desird
to have of Druinas Monarke, undertook to discover unto him a notable
conjuration intended both against his royal dignity and person, which was;
That Villerio with some of the Prime of his Counsel had consulted of the
arguments and means that were to be taken for the dissolving of the
forementioned treaties; And that their consultations passd so far, that if
the Majesty of Druinas King would not accommodat himself to their Counsels
herein, he should have a house of pleasure where he might retire himself to
his sports, in regard that prime Rocalino had now years and parts answerable
for the public government.

The royal Oak upon this imperfect overture, made many instances unto them
that they would give him the Authors of so pernicious a conspiracy; but they
instead of confirming the great zeal they pretended to bear him* all the
answer they made consisted of arguments against the discovery of the
Conspirators. Hereupon his Majesty commanded some of his secretst Counselors,
with others to be examind and sworn, and that such interrogatories should be
propounded unto them that were most pertinent to the accusation; whereby there
was found in Villerio, and the rest who were impeachd a very clear and sincere
innocence, touching these foul imputations.

This being so, new instances were made to the said Ambassadors, that they
should not prefer the discovery of the names of the conspirators to the
security of his royal Majesty, the truth and honor of themselves; and the
hazard of an opinion to be held the tracers of a plot of such malice, sedition
and danger; But the Informers continued in a knobby kind of obstinacy
resolving still to conceal the names of the Authors.

Hereupon Druinas Monarch sent two of his sages to tell them, that they being
the Authors of an accusation so pernicious, had rendered themselves incapable to
treat further with him, and were it not for the respect he bore to Elaiana's
King whose person they did represent, he would and could by the law of Nations
and the right of his own Royal Justice proceed against them with such
severity as the offense deservd, but for the reason aforesaid he would leave
the reparation thereof to the justice of the Royal Olive himself of whom he
would demand and require it.

Hereupon the Sovereign Minister who was then employed in ELAIANA was commanded
to require refaction and satisfaction against the Informers or rather inventors
and forgers of the aforesaid misinformation, which was of that quality, that it
was sufficient to put impressions in him of perpetual jealousies, in regard
that through Villerio, they did wound Prince Rocalino, and the best of his
subjects; for it was not probable, that Villerio would have hurld himself into
such an enterprise without communicating of it first to him, yet
notwithstanding the Royal Oak would not mingle the correspondence and
friendship he holds with the Majesty of the Olive, with the faults and offenses
of his Ministers, but leave them, and restrain them to themselves.

These things being represented to Elaianas King, he seemd then to be somewhat
sensible of them; but when the aforesaid Ministers were returned, they were
only confind for a few days: but afterward instead of reprehension they were
rather rewarded and further employed.

Not long after, the Royal Oak who all his life time had continued in a
constant calm of tranquillity, notwithstanding that all the circumjacent
Forests were often in fearful combustions about him, and had been the
gracious Vmpire of so many Sovereign quarrels (glorying in the attribute of
peaceful (and might be said to have bin the Caducean Rod which composd and
charmd all dissentions twixt other Princes) was feld by the dire hand of fate,
being newly plungd in a war against Elaiana.

From the very time that he sprouted first above ground, he was pursued with
treasonable practices, and his tutelar Angel still mervailously guarded him.

Nor was there ever any Monarke upon earth since his time that writ from the
Cedar to the shrub, of a greater latitude of learned knowledge, which made him
to be termd Druinas third University. Aarons rod never bore more buds then
under the branches of this gracious Oak; Nor did the Groves of the Muses and
common wealth of letters so fructify at any time; so, that in the firmament of
learning he will shine to all posterity a star of the greatest magnitude,
Crescet oculto velut Arbor aevo, Fama. --

Touching his profound reach in holy things, let that pourtrait drawn out of
the sacred Oracle, and the difficultst part thereof, bear the world witness;
which piece he sent the great Archflamin to pay him all old arrearages.

Never any Country flourished more in the Commutative part of justice, as did
Druina in his time, specially the first ten years, in which space, besides
other places, THAMISOND did so enrich her self, that she gathered more than
she had done in thirty years before.

His stately spouse sprung out of the ancient stem of the Royal Fur of
Elatena, was transplanted some years before to the celestial Paradise,
whither it was said she went in Noah's Arc, and He in Elia's Chariot, al^uding
to the quality of their diseases, the one aquatike, the other hot and dry.

In this peaceful Prince there was an admird concurrence of many high
Platonique virtues, only he would sometimes come too near the fire of
passion, yet never in any serious, but sudden trivial passages.

Munificent he was beyond the ordinary custom of Kings; most confident of the
fidelity of his Agents and Instruments; For he was wont ^o say, that when he
employed any servant in a serious business of trust, he would not imbitter the
sweetness he conceavd of his fidelity with any mixtures of fear or
diffidence. Yet if any miscarried, the distaste would not dwell long in him,
nor I dare say did the Sun ever go down upon his anger.

Some there were upon whom the beams of his regal favor reflected more
strongly. And why not? have not the wisest of Earthly Monarques had their
Favorits? For if every Creature is left free to like where he list, it were
preposterous and injurious to deprive Kings of that liberty which the meanest
of their Subjects enjoy, they command multitudes of Subjects as they are Kings,
but they are subjects to their own passions, as they are composed of four
Elements.

The Princely Standell which had been a long time the hopes of Druinas Crown,
became now the Crown of her hopes, and succeeded in the Royal Throne. --
Tandem fit surculus Arbor.

A Prince endued with such a strength of virtue, that he seems to strike
malice dumb; A Prince of whom it may be said, that he hates the very names of
those vices that are incident to Princes, more then other Princes hate the
vices themselves. He was well balancd, and of a growth just ripe for this
mighty burden, having newly taken the vest of virility, and being reard up to a
comely clean timbred strong bulk, wonderful active and patient of toil; And
if foreign travel begets wisdom in regard the eye, which has a more
immediate commerce with the soul, and is a faithfuller witness then the ear;
He is the best traveld Prince by the Sea and Land of any, and therein has the
advantage of his neighbors.

Of a solid and excelling judgment in the hardest and choycest things, but
specially in the service and deserts of his Officers and servants, who in a
Monarchy are accordingly active or careless, as the Prince is capable to
distinguish and judge of their labors; Whereby I hope to see Druina vindicated
more and more of the aspersions the world abroad casts upon her; that she
slowly seeks after well qualified instruments, and more slowly cherishes
virtue in her own plants, but admires any thing in strangers, and is more
ready to employ them, though she have of her own, equally if not better
qualified. Most singularly indulgent he is of his Royal Consort, which is so
acceptable to Heaven, that she corresponds with him, in bringing him forth
many real fruits of his love, sweet Princely Graffes, which I may well avouch,
are the best for alliance and stock that ever the earth had, being as
immediately extracted out of the Oak and the Vine, so are they nearely allied
to the Cedar, the Olive, the Fur, the anciently descended Vine, and all the
best stemmes of the Western world; So that if ever any Plants sprung de semine
Divum, as some Philosophers affirmd, they may be said to have sprung so. He is
inflexibly just in the expiation of the crying sin of murder, yet most
tender of the life of the meanest shrub that grows under his Princely boughs.

Most tenacious he is, of his purposes, when they have been pondred, and layne
long in the balance of mature deliberation, and winnowed by the debate of his
sages. But above all things else (and indeed all things else are but bables to
this) he is most punctual in his piety to heaven; so that take all this
together, this inference will result, that if he were, but one of the ordinary
vulgar plants, they that know aright, would judge him to be one of the
compleatest, and most virtuous of all Druina.

But the Crown which descended upon him was inlayed with so many difficulties,
that it might be justly called a Crown of thorns for many years; For after a
long calm of peace, he was left newly engagd in a war against one of the
greatest of earthly Monarchs, and (as it was said of one of his progenitors)
with a rustie sword, and empty purse, the Crown being fallen into a
bottomless pit or gulf of debt, besides his own former arreares;

The moving fortress which are the chief strength of Druina were in slender
repair, his magazines of ammunition ill supplied; The Lady Carbasilis with her
numerous issue were to be provided for, and he was left to seek for a spouse
for himself.

But by the special favor of heaven, he has surmounted all these
difficulties and brought the glory of Druinas diadem to cast a greater
splendour then ever it did. Touching a royal Consort, the high hand of
providence, reservd for him such a one, that there never sprung up above ground
a more beauteous or approaching nearer some celestial deity; for through those
starry casements of her soul, one may discern in her a kind of divinity
transscending the race of mortals, so that in this Virginian Vine, the saying
of the wisest of Kings may be verifyed, That a good Wife, is a Tree of life.

This young royal Oak being now settled in his throne, he sends Villerio to
visit the disconsolat Carbasilis, and to confirm a league defensive and
offensive with the Willowes his fast friends.

He suddenly sends a mighty fleet against Elaiana, but the Critickes of those
times abroad, said, this fleet so quickly riggd showed rather the power then
providence of Druina, yet she returned without any passive encounter at all.

He employes two of his noblest Elmes to treat of an alliance with that peerles
piece of natures rarities, the Lady Aretine, which great business by their
wise and successeful negotiation was concluded in fewer months, then Elaiana
spent years in her treaty; so that the La: Aretine was entitled by holy rite,
QUEEN of Druina, which she would not accept of, unless she had the title of
Ampelona's QUEEN also added.

Thus the youngest spray of the great martial Vine came to Druina, with a
great mass of ready treasure, and a row of her own Country Graffes for her
first set of servants; But they misdemeaning themselves by some fond fopperies
of superstition in prejudice of the La: Aretine her health, and for other
moral miscariages were suddenly dismissd and sent back to Ampelona with bag
and baggage, all their salaries being punctually paid them to a penny, and
many of them parted with rewards;

Though a very modern Chronicler traduceth Druina in this point, to have
dismissd them without their wages, etc. But as in this, so in many other
relations he takes up things upon trust; and imperfect partial information;

A gross defect in a royal Chronologer, nor indeed can it be judgd whether
his faults in this kind, or flatteries throughout the whole body of his story,
be grosser; And whereas history should be the torch of truth, he makes her
in diverse places a fuliginous link of lies.

The renvoy of the Ampelonians was ill taken by the Royal Vine, and the
suddennes of the action did much aggravate the business, with the quality of
the persons, being for the most part younger Graffes, having parted with what
they had in their own soil to take rooting and grow up in Druina about the
Lady Aretine.

Upon these distasts the voyaging Merchants pillage one another, as they found
advantage, yet the two Kings stirrd not a good while after; For it is with
Kings sometimes, as with Porters, whose packs may justle one against the other,
yet they remain good friends still.

Not long after DRVINAS Monarke convokes an universal Assembly;

To whom, He declard to have called them together for the safety of Religion,
for securing his kingdoms and subjects at home, having two such mighty
Monarkes his actual enemies, for the assisting of his Allies and Confederates
abroad, specially the Royal Fur, who had lately embarkd himself very far in
open war against the Cedar principally in behalf of Prince Altapinus, and was
reducd to wonderful streights, being chasd out of a great part of his
dominions, by the Cedars General.

For these with other important motives he propounded a supply of Treasure.

These things at first overture were well resented by the lower assembly, who
with much alacrity agreed to a good round supply, and indeed it was the
greatest gift that ever subjects gave KING, but before it was brought to any
sound perfection, this good work was unluckily disturbd by a multitude of
questions concerning the privilege of the subject, and prerogative of the
Sovereign; by which delays the reality and reputation of that great Donative
was much lessened, and the foreign actions, the Royal Oak was engagd in abroad
receivd much prejudice. Yet he did formally confirm unto them all their
ancient privileges, and gave two most gracious answers to their petitions
tending to this end: And having complied with them thus to their hearts desire,
as also in two former Assemblies wherein were delivered them as sacrifices some
of the Crown Officers, and done them sundry other Acts of Princely grace, yet
some extravagant spirits given over to fancy, and faction, disturbd the calm
of these proceedings.

They fall like thunder upon Villerio, alleging that he was the cause of the
incongruity in government at home, and of disasters abroad; That he was the
first that deflourd the Virgin honor, making her a kind of prostitut, and
mere merchandise salable for white and red earth, which is too base a price
for her, that should be the prime guerdon of virtue, through whose temple only,
there should be a passage to hers. They complain of his exorbitant power,
having in his hands the privatst and most reposefull offices of trust, by sea
and land, and such as were incompatible and never known in the person of one
subject.

They cry out that none received advancement but his progeny, which they termd
the tribe of fortune, with other high clamours: Thus he who in their former
meetings was a great subject of their commendation, when for dissolving the two
Treaties with Elaiana they said he had done so well, that he deservd to have
his statue publicly erected in the midst of Thamisond, became now the chief
subject of their complaints and grievances.

But the rays of Royal Majesty reverberated so strongly upon Villerio, that
they dispelled all those clouds, which did hang over and thus obumbrat him, and
the rather because Evidence, which is the lantern of of the Law, was wanting,
these accusations having no other proof but public fame.

In these times a warlike fleet was prepared against Ampelona, in regard the
Vine had not performd certain capitulations, that were promised the Royal Oak
in favor of the Eusebians there, besides one moitie of the Lady Aretines dower
was not sent according to Article, with other provocations and secret motives.

The enterprise failing, though the first Invasion (and would heaven had pleased
the retreat had been answerable) was made with as brave a resolution as any
martial attempt could possibly be, and in managing the Soldier Villerio, with
the rest, showed undeniable assurances of valor: yet the Royal Oak was not a
whit daunted hereby, but presently commanded a greater number of vessels of
war to be riggd and made ready in pursuit of the same design, upon which
Villerio was to go Generalissimo again; But being upon point of embarking,
this great Commander having at his beck such a multitude of martial spirits
was suddenly cut off, to the consternation and amazement of all the world, by a
fatal stroke which was given him with a small contemptible instrument, and
with such an admirable advantage, that it was impossible either by slight or
art, or strength of engine, to dispatch one sooner out of this world; And which
made the act more tragical, his noble Consort, then pregnant, beheld him thus
felld, and weltring upon the ground presently after.

Thus fell that procere goodly fair timberd Elm in the fullness of his
strength, who had so long flourished under the gracious branches of two Royal
Oaks, having led half his life in that height of fortune, and affluence of all
earthly pleasure; who being thus fallen, many inferior Trees grew great out of
his boughs, In so much that the saying of the Philosopher, who being askd, what
was a doing in heaven, answered, Magnae ollae franguntur, and ex frustis earum
minores fiunt, might have been not improperly applied to what then passd in
Druina. Out of this sad Catastrophe may be drawn this lesson, That great ones
may secure themselves from guilt, but not from envy, which like the
Sunne-beames beats upon rising grounds, and towering high Trees, when the shrub
is safe. Cernis ut ventis agitatur ingens
Pinus. --


He had a concurrence of all those graceful parts, that might attract Princely
love, and conduce to the accomplishment of a Courtier, and had he containd
himself still in that condition, he might happily have lasted until time had
covered him with hoary moss.

The Royal Majesty which first took him into favor, agenid and traind him up
for his own turn by certain degrees in the most pertinent affairs and
Mysteries of State, observing therein the progress of nature which suffers
no motion to pass from one extreme to another, but by intermediat spaces, as
she uses to pass from Winter to Summer by the interposition of the spring,
and so return to Winter by Autumn: so that Platonike Prince servd himself of
certain pawses to advance and employ him; And he was no improper piece to
work upon, having so pliable and gentle a genius, that he grew very pregnant
and dextrous in the art of government.

Among other maxims of policy he proposd to himself in the conduct of his
affairs, one was to neglect apologies, whereof he said, he saw no other fruit
then to multiply discourse, and humor the vulgar, nor did he ever value any
pasquils that were dropd up and down, so far, as to think them worthy of
his revenge, which questionless was a well settled Rule, for Libels neglected
quickly find their own graves; and dissipat to air.

He was none of those Idolaters that worship the beast with many heads, that
use to burn incense to the vulgar.

And as herein, so in many other things, great abilities appeard in him, for
extraordinary must be the wisdom of him who floateth upon the stream of
Sovereign favor, wherein there is seldom any sistence, twixt sinking and
swimming. A sure friend he was, and a resenting foe, a brave Master to
servants, and a remembrer of the least good office; For his stock; he
transplanted most of them to plentiful soyles. And doubtless he had a brave
soul to actuat that comely composure; And an innated valor appeard in him,
when he put himself upon the Soldiers defense as he receivd the mortal
stabbe. I will conclude with part of a Character that a judicious Cavalier gave
lately of him; He was a great example of Sobriety and temperance, but not of
continency.

The Assassin that feld him found oftentimes strong and strange reluctancies in
himself, nor could he give any other reason that pushd him forward to this
black attempt, but that he was blasted by the great Assembly, and so thought it
an act agreeable to heaven to take away the partition wall between the King
and his people, and make him a sacrifice to the public, though with an
unavoydablenesse of his own destruction, confronting thereby death in the
face; Whereby was verified that saying, that he who is careless of his own
life, is master of another's. But Heaven forbid that this custom which has
such a vogue in other parts, should take footing in DRVINA.

This tragedy being acted, the Royal Oak pursues his design for supporting
of Petrina, with the Eusebians in Ampelona, but this disaster as it bred
confusion for the time, so it causd a stand in the procedure of that great
action, which gave the Vine respit to finish those stupendous circumvallations
and barricadoes he had reard up by sea and land to begirt Petrina; In so much
that when another noble Elm was sent with strength sufficient to have achievd
a greater exploit, he found her passd cure.

This some say went to the very heart of Elaiana, who in regard of that notable
advantage, and addition of united power the Vine got hereby, would have found
some way or other to have relievd Petrina, had she thought Druina would have
missd it.

The great Assembly aforesaid rejoynd, and met again in one body, and now he
that was supposd to be the cause of the tempest being thrown overboard, there
were great hopes a calm should ensue, but the storm continued as furious as
ever, and unlucky passions blustred as much, if not more, than they had done
formerly in Villerios time.

They flew a fresh upon other great Officers and questiond a duty, that for
garding of the seas, and common defense of the realm had been indisputably
granted to so many preceding Kings for a been esse, which they made difficulty
to afford the Royal Oak regnant, unles he would first renounce alright to it,
and so receive it merely from them. Thus they choppd logic with Sovereign
Majesty who movd with these traverses, resolvd though to his unutterable grief
to dismiss this great Counsel, but upon the point when this was to be done in
form, the lower assembly in a strange tumultuary manner adjournd themselves,
before they had receivd his royal pleasure. They denied him his Officers at
arms, violated the prolocutor, being twice sent for, delayed to let in his
messenger, and discontentments turning thus to a strange kind of disobedience,
they broake up in confusion.

Add hereunto that notwithstanding there was another peculiar Assembly of
Reverend Yewes of purpose for the regulating and sweeping clean of the house
of the Almighty, yet the poplars must make it their office to tamper with the
constitution of holy things; And indeed this is one of the greatest scandals
and brands, that not only Petropolis, but other Forreners (who have with her
forsaken Petropolis) cast upon Druina. viz. that her Ecclesiastical Ordinances
are the commands and injunctions of this secular power, and members of this
Assembly, who not only confirm (which may become them well enough, and is
necessary for a general obedience) but take upon them to be Judges herein. So
that one being askd what they did in that lower great Assembly, he was answered
pleasantly, That they were making of a new Creed; Another was overheard to
say, that he could not be quiet in his Conscience, until the holy text
should be confirmd by an Act of theirs. Whence may be inferrd, that some of
them believe, it belongs to them to make sanctions, as well as statutes.

This inducd the Royal Oak, though he be responsible to none for an account of
his actions but to the high Majesty of Heaven, to publish an open protest unto
the world, for the satisfaction of his better sort of subjects, of the causes
of these disorders, declaring that while Villerio lived, he was entitled to
all the distempers and ill events of former assemblies, therefore much
endeavor was usd to demolish him as the only wall of separation twixt their
Sovereign and them, but he now being cut off, no alteration was found amongst
them at all, or calmness in their proceedings.

He was pleased to declare further, that he imputed not these commotions to the
whole Assembly, knowing that there were amongst them, many religious, grave and
well minded Patriotts, but the sincerer and better part of them being
over-borne by the clamours and practices of others, who careless of their
duties, and taking advantage of the times and his necessities, constraind him
to break off that meeting, which had it been answered with like duties on
their parts, as love on his, might have proved happy to all Druina.

These fatal distempers as they did much hurt to the body politic at home,
for they were like humors stirrd in the natural body without evacuation, so
did they produce disadvantagious effects abroad, and better had it been that
the Raysers and fomenters of them had never sprang up in Druina.

The Royal Fur had engagd himself in the quarrel of Altapinus against the
Cedar, and he had proceeded so far as to the imminent and actual danger of his
own person. And expecting from Druina those monthly supplies which were
promised by capitulation, partly for want of them, the one half of his
territories being already over-runne and plundered, he was constraind to
shuffle up a peace with the Cedar (without Druinas privity.)

And it was high time for him, for whereas the Fur was usd to be a dwelling
for the stork, the Eagle was like to build his nest there.

The foresaid great expedition to relieve Petrina did also suffer hereby, and
indeed the whole party of the Eusebians every where up and down the world, who
had their eyes fixd upon Druinas Monarke their defendor. Who so much laboring
to take the old wonted great trodden way, for supplies toward the support of
such public designs, was constraind at last to take the higher road, by
having recourse to his Sovereign prerogative to ballast the common purse of
the state;

And a kingdom is like a Ship at Sea, whose ballast should be the Princes
Coffers; which if they be light and empty, she will do naught but tumble up
and down, nor can she be made to run a direct and steady Course.

About this time fell one of the noblest Elmes in the whole Forest, extracted
of the ancient stock of the Monticolians, that bore the smallest, yet chiefest
staff of office and command in Druinas Court; And his fall was the more
remarkable, because the night immediately before he was discoursing of, and
slighting the art of those foolish Astrologers, and Genethliacall Ephemerists,
that use to pry into the horoscope of Nativities, whereof one had much tampred
with his, and positively affirmd he should not reach 51. years, And now said
he, I have lived (thanks be to Heaven) fifty one years and a day complete,
But the next morning he was taken with an Apoplexy, whereof he presently
died; much lamented he was, for his noblenes, and mervailous candor of
disposition, and other brave endowments, and therefore generally beloved in
City, Court, and Country. And being a long time averse to the match with
Elaiana Mordogan put a shrewd pernicious complement upon him; For being at a
private audience in discourse with Druinas Monarke, he fell to magnify the
greatness, loyalty, and wealth of his subjects; and specially of this noble
Elm, who had such rooting in the hearts of the poplars, that upon any faction,
or tumult, he verily thought he could draw after him all the Trees of the
Forest. But this was spoken of purpose to make some impression of jealousies
in the breast of Majesty.

As these traverses happened in Druina, behold Bumelias King the Martial Ash,
holding himself to be much affronted by the Cedar in that he would vouchsafe
no audience to his Ambassadors, and that he encroachd upon the Territories of
his ALLIES; As also for some preventive reasons of state; He crosses those
cold Seas, and rusheth into Rhenusium like a whirlewind, carrying all before
him though with small numbers at first, not exceeding 7000. Yet like a ball of
snow tumbling down a hill, he still gatherd strength as he passd: and made
Chips of all the Trees he met withal. He restored two of his said Allies to
their entire possessions, and proceeding further, and being dared as he was a
Cavalier by that great Veteran Captain then the Cedars General (who the day
before had shrewdly shaken the plane) to meet him in pitchd field; He answered
that he was something more than a Cavalier, and that he had thousands under him
as good as that General himself, therefore he would not fail to find him
out speedily.

The next day he kept his word and gave him battle, where he carried away as
fair and complete a victory as possibly could be, and thereby he freed the
Planes Country from the impendent dangers that hung over it.

He marchd still on, making his passage by the point of the sword every where,
He crosses the great River that denominates Rhenusium, upon whose banks he
kept his festivals in an admired triumphant manner in one of the chiefest
Archflamins towns, whither Ambassadors resorted unto him from far and
near, as if he had been some Caesar. The Royal Vine being displeasd that he
had crossd that great River, and invaded the Territories of the Church (whereof
he had taken the protection) without his privity, sent to tell him by his
Ambassador;

That if he did not stand to his Articles, he had an Army of 80000. to enter
into Rhenusium when he pleased. The magnanimous Ash answered, that he had not
infringd the least tittle of what was articled, that they aymd at one mark,
and their ends were concentrike, and he knew how to make his way in Rhenusium,
better than he could tell him.

And touching the Archflamin in whose metropolis he then kept his Court, he
had broke promise both with the Royal Vine and him, by ceasing to be
neutrall; As for the menace he sent, if Ampelona had 80000. to rush into to
Rhenusium, be had 20000. and with them he would be sooner at the walls of
Tutelia, then those 80000. could be on the frontiers of Rhenusium.

Afterward he made himself master of Baccharia, but to re-invest Altapinus
there, he would have tied him to hard, and indeed to very harsh terms; first,
That he should make no leavie of Military forces, without his consent. That he
should supply him with so many thousands upon his own charge during these
wars; that he should still reserve two of the chiefest Towns of Baccharia
in deposito, where he might put in garrison to be maintaind by the
contributions of the Country; That he should make no league or confederacy
with any other, without his privity and consent.

That there should be free exercise of the Bumelian Religion throughout all
Baccharia, and an Academy, and Schools erected to that end. That he should
acknowledge, under God, to have receivd his Country from him; with diverse
other such restrictions.

But that noble stout Elm whom the Royal Oak employed at that time in
Rhenusium in a high quality, of purpose to observe his motions, would not
condescend hereunto.

Hence Bumelias King breaks his way to the Elders Court, where he shook him
ill favouredly for the time, ranging through the very bowels of his Country,
and plundring all wheresoever he came, as far as his very cells and clossets.

But as no violent course lasts long, this irresistible torrent of his
tropheys was stoppd by the dire hand of destiny, so that in the throng of his
own victorious troops, this martial Ash was felld, the greatest of his
enemies whom he most redoubted for his valor, falling before in his sight. So
that, as in life, so at, and after his death he proud a Conqueror, falling upon
the bed of honor and victory both at once, in a party colored field Gules and
Argent, but the crest Sable, so that it was impossible for a Soldier to bid
the world farewell, in a braver manner.

His fall for the present struck an earth quake into all minds, nor could the
vulgar be inducd a great while to believe that he was feld, thinking him to
be impenetrable, and above the stroke of fate.

An Heroicke Prince he was, and in such a height, that it was said the soul of
Caesar had entered into him; So that some think he sprung of the race of that
Tree, whereof Achilles spear, and Hercules Club were made, only he was taxd
to be over-ventrous and headstrong; besides there were some, that observd
him, to be somewhat elated by that monstrous course of conquering, but as
Adrianas Ambassador apologizd for him, He had been more than a mortal wight,
if he had not been somewhat altered at the success of such high feats, which
were such, that considering the quality of the Country, Towns, and enemies,
none of the twelve Caesar acts, paralleld his in so short a time.

But I will relate a thing worthy of wonder; amongst others who receivd
contentment at the proceedings of the Warlike Ash, Melissanus the great
Archflamin would be often inquisitive, and well pleased to hear of any
successful encounter of his against the Cedar.

Some think the reason was, in regard the Cedar had a little before disturbd
the peace of Bombicina, and joynd with Elaiana to kindle a new fire in her,
therefore he was well contented to see him a little shaken. Others say, there
was some secret tie, that if the Ash should compass his designs in Rhenusium,
he should assist Melissanus to recover Hipparcha, (which the Olive has so long
detaind from Petropolis) as a reward for his neutralitie: Hereupon when there
was a great Contracto in the holy Senate, at the time when the Cedars and Olives
Ambassadors demanded pecuniary supplies out of the holy treasure for the
support of Religion in RHENVSIVM and preventing the further spreading of the
ASH, the IVY himself answered, That he was satisfied Religion was neither the
subject nor scope of those Wars; And that the holy treasure, was to be
reservd, and issued for holy uses, and not misapplied to any other ends.

Whereunto one of the prime members of that high Senate, replying, That the Ivy
for his coldness in the Cedars quarrel was traducd abroad for half an
Heretic, he was taken up very short, and adjudgd corrigible for such
presumptuous language.

Amongst many others, which had obligations to the martial Ash, the Plane
receivd no small benefit by him; for he preservd his Country three several
times from impendent and actual danger; but it seems he quickly forgot him,
for after his fall he shuffled up a peace with the Cedar in which the
Bumelians were quite excluded: And it had been wishd, that the princely plane,
(though allowed his sprincklings of wine, because as the Arbolists observe it
is more natural to him, and makes him thrive better than any other Tree) had
in these traverses been less wavering, and not suffered himself to be shaken
with such incertaine blasts: for I cannot tell how often he put in, and pulld
out his pin from the stake.

Had the adventrous Ash survivd that fatal, yet victorious, day he fell on,
many think the Cedar was so far shrunk that he had been put to very hard
shifts to have made head against him to any purpose again. For indeed his
progress was such, that both sides stood at a stand, gazing and doubting where
his conquest would terminat. And had he brought his intents home to his aim,
he would have cast the policy of the lower world into a new mould, and happily
have put his own confederates to stand upon their guard; And as for many others,
so had it not been wholesome for Druina, that his acquests had extended
further, which makes me, that I cannot wonder enough at the shallowness and
impertinent zeal of the vulgar sort in Druina, who were still so eager, and
joyful to hear him still go on, and carried away with such an ignorant
devotion for his successes, when it little concernd their religion or security.
Amongst diverse others who rejoycd and triumphd at the fall of the warlike Ash,
the Elder lifted up his hollow boughs, so high, that a little after he took
heart of grace to court one of the youngest sprayes of the Imperial Cedar for
his Consort, though in point of age he quadrupply exceeded her, being cauterizd
in four several places about his body to have vent for his malignant humors,
wherewith it seems he much abounded, specially toward Prince Altapinus, who
was one of the nearest to him in stock; Besides his young Consort was sprung
as close to him, and as near as could be out of his own stem. Yet neither
disparity of years, nor propinquity of stock, could hinder the design policy
had herein, but he carried her clear away;

And what fruit can be expected of this inoculation, but black unsavourie
berries, and Flowers only to make the tartest Viniger, such as the ELDER
naturally bears.

And what fruit also the beech will produce by his late ingrafting upon the
other spray, though in a far ignobler way, (having by letters and
instruments) attempted a Princely Graffe, which as far precels her, which he
has lighted upon, as a Damask Rose does the Couslip in natures workmanship,
quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi,) I had rather expect then
determine.

But these kind of infolliations wresting so far the laws of nature, have
seldom proved prosperous; I know not what they may do upon this modern
politic race, which as she pretends to have mounted to this might and
largeness by these means, so she goes on, to ciment her designs, and
fortify her self still by this course; But some of the best genethliacall
Arbolists observe, that though these unequal imbuddings may flourish for a
time, they will fade away at last by a fate, that unavoydably uses to attend
them.

Before the lowest of the celestial bodies had finishd her monthly course,
ALTAPINVS also fell, who had been a companion to the warlike Ash in many of
his exploits through Rhenusium; A Prince who by a hard destiny, became a
tennis-ball a long while to the blind Goddess; A Prince in whom many virtues
did co-habit. He was free from that vice Rhenusium is so naturally addicted
unto, where the custom is so general that it takes away the conscience to be
peccant therein.

Very sedulous he was in the pursuit of his affairs, parsimonious and
wonderfully indulgent of his young Cions, and the glory of her sex Carbasilis,
who though Homebias Crown was lost, yet by her Princely comportment, she got
then another kingdom which she retains ever since, as may be inferrd out of
her name;

For at the beginning of these unlucky traverses, she wisely turned her self
(though sprouted naturally of the Oak) into a palm, and with a more than
feminine courage took for her motto ever since, -- Sub mole resurgo. For it
can hardly be judgd, whether her various sorts of pressures, or patience were
greater.

Many brave adventrous spirits fell for love of her; amongst others I cannot
forget, the high-hearted martialist Brunonio, who first lost his lands, then
one of his chiefest limbs, and lastly his life in her quarrel.

Nor can I omit here a Noble Elm sprung up in the streets of Tamisond, who
has been a most constant and resolute Adventurer, and conversd with danger a
great while for her, though with extraordinary expense, the late loss of his
liberty, and many traverses of apparent hazard, even to the admiration of the
Ash himself, and envy of others.

Not long before these times, there being interchangeable overtures made on all
sides; The Royal Oak renewed a peace both with the Vine and the Olive, twixt
whom there passd many shockes; for the Olive, the worst that Druina suffered
was, that she exchangd Coals for Sugar.

And now behold a glorious serenity of peace again in Druina, having had two
of her potentst neighbors upon her back at once.

It has been a maxim often verified in policy; That Kings may marry, but not
their Crowns, and never was this more exemplified, then by the alliance of
those Princely sprayes that sprung of the last great Martial Vine, who
notwithstanding that of themselves there were never any in whom sweetness of
disposition, and virtue her self was more resplendent in such a degree, as if
the three graces had contributed their utmost power to make them good; yet I
know not by what fate or fortune it is come to pass, there have fallen out
diverse traverses of War, since the inarching of those graffes, upon the
Olive, the Pine, and the Oak; Which yet continues, and is daily exasperated
twixt the Olive and the Vine, who though at first, they crossd one another
designs by sending auxiliary forces in collateral ways, they do now
directly and in good earnest, clash their branches one against the other.

For the justness of their quarrel, I will not undertake here to debate it;
nor determine whether a just fear without any active invasion or offense be
sufficient grounds to Ampelona for a war, and whether it may deserve the name
of a defensive. I have read that the true cause of the Peloponnesian War
(though they were blanchd with other specious colors) was the over-growing
greatness of Athens, which did as it were impose upon the Lacedaemonians a
necessity of arms; Preventive Wars have been practiced by the best policied
states, they rid the Forest oftentimes of superfluous plants; and are as a
purge for the body politic: And in all ages it has been held a maine part
of providence, to have an eye,

That their confining neighbors, should neither by too near an approach, or
increase of territory, or enfeebling of confederates, nor by engrossing of
trade, or stopping of passage, receive any addition of strength, And in point
of wealth to bear up still in equal proportion, upon the enhancement of the
rates of coin, excrescence of demeanes, or imposition of tolls; This makes the
Vine so Salt his subject, and the Olive pepper his so much.

The lawfulness of war in the general was never questiond, so it have a
Sovereign head, not otherwise. For the Almighty is the God of Hosts and arms,
as well as of peace; And wars well grounded are naught else but suits of
appeal to the consistory of heaven, when there is no superior on earth to
determine the cause: And besides the lawfulness hereof, there seems to be a
kind of inevitableness and necessity in it; Some Philosophers were of
opinion, that the world does subsist by a perpetual strife in some part or
other, I go not above the concave of the Moon, where the celestial bodies,
though in relation to us (poor mortals) they seem to strange, and have their
contrary motions, eclipses and oppositions, yet amongst themselves they are in
a most regular, and constant sweet course of concord; But for the elementary
world, all things are in a kind of restless conflict; The Elements themselves,
which are the primitive ingredients of all bodies, are in perpetual combat,
they still encroach one upon another, and labor to repel each other, but
amongst the rest the fire is most vigorous and ravenous, the earth has
frequent fits of the Palsy, the Sea is never still, the air is agitated with
winds, and new monsters and meteorologicall impressions are hourly engendered;
so in humane bodies composd of this stuff, there is an incessant warfare
amongst the humors for predominancy, and while this natural war lasts, the
earth cannot be without civil and political preliations, the mind following
most commonly the temper of the body.

But a mad tenet it was of the Candian (in that divine and high soaring
Philosopher) that peace is but a naked and empty name, a kind of Chymera, and
that every state expects but its advantage to set upon the skirts of the other,
whence he concludes, that there is always a kind of fermentation of war,
and no kind of real love and league between Princes, but only an impuissance
or inconveniencie to do hurt.

An age there was, and it was the last, when Druina, Ampelona, and Elaiana were
so circumspect, and Eagle eyed, that scarce an acre of ground, could be gotten
by either of the three, but the other two would be sure to do their best, to
set the scales even again. And the like diligence has been practiced in
diverse other Regions, and it seems is now by Ampelona, by reason of the late
new acquests the Olive, and his race in Rhenusium have made; which induces her
to stick more close then ever to Itelia, as also to the Bumelians, who else I
believe had gone near to have quite disbanded long before now.

The Princely Sycomore which stood as a screene twixt Ampelona and Rhenusium
has smarted for this, being fallen just under the same fatal predicament, as
Altapinus; both exulating from their own patrimoniall Territories.

But a hard case it seems to be, that the Princely spray which was of the
self same ancient stock with the Sycomore, being branches of the same Tree,
should in the verdantst season of her virginity, be coupled according to the
true rites of sacred law, with Ampelonas apparent heir, and then, poor Lady,
to be abandoned without the least imaginary fault of hers;

And more strange it seems to the world, that Ampelona, specially that now her
prime Minister of state is of a holy function, should go about to prefer a
particular temporary custom of hers, viz that her Heir apparent should not
any ways dispose of himself to marriage, without the privity and consent of
the State, to the prejudice and flat breach of the eternal law of the
Almighty: And so to attempt the nullifying of that act, and loosning of that
knot which by divine Ordinance should be indissoluble; And so make a kind of
medlar of that Princely Sycomore, she being every way superior to his first
Consort.

It is true, policy is warrantable, yet but as a handmaid to divinity, and
absurd it is to make the Mistress stoop and give place to the servant; Policy
is like the Apocrypha, which is allowed to be digested into one volume, and
read with the sacred Text, but when it thwarts any thing that is Canonical,
away with it.

The ravishing of the Sycomore's Country, happened in an unlucky time for young
Altapinus, for, I believe, it rendered the Treaty for a restitution of Baccharia
more knotty and difficult; In so much that some think they must be put in
Counter-scales hereafter, and move both upon one hinge.

A much famed statist Elaiana had half an age since, was usd to say, that if
Ampelona had three things favorable, she were eternal, viz. Petropolis, the
Sea, and Counsel.

Touching the first, Melissanus who now swayes the great Archflaminship, is
mightily devoted to her, having been so long rooted in her, that it seems he
naturally affects her soil and plants.

And oftentimes we find that nature her self yields to custom, that great
Giant, who is so prevalent, that oftentimes, we shape the discourse of reason,
and course of nature to the inbred notions and preconceptions it has imprinted
in our minds, besides, habitual frequency of conversation is one of the
greatest loadstones of love.

For the Sea, Itelia serves her for her docke and Arsenall, nor was she ever
so improved and potent that way; And I wish Itelia may never have cause to rue
the time she did it.

For Counsel, she has lighted upon an Instrument of a mervailous contriving
and sedulous spirit, as solid as he is subtle, which is rare under that
Clime, In so much that some have termd him the prodigy of prudence, others
have soard higher, and called him the grand Genius, and tutelar Angel of
Ampelona, others fly yet higher, and call him the supreme Intelligence, the
spirit that moves the heavens and the stars, the Phoenix of the earth, and
such like superlatives, and Hyperbole's.

He is so strongly rooted in the opinion of the Royal Vine, that he
post-poseth filial, and fraternall love, to his favor toward him.

Some give other Characters of him, and call him the Incendiary of Ampelona,
that his mind is of the color of his habit, sanguine; That he is endued with
the same spirit, that sometimes a famous Archflamin in Elaiana was, who said
that Gunpowder in the field gave as sweet a perfume, as Incense at the Altar;

This makes him keep such a stir with Drum and trumpet up and down in many
places; yet though that humor suits with the color of his Coat, it does not I
am sure with his calling. Nor because he has got a peculiar title to
distinguish him from others, should he be so far elated with that Eminency
as to expect priority of place of such high Ministers, who immediately
represent Sovereign and independent Majesty, and if he be stout in this
point, he must give them leave to be stately.

But for his intermedling with arms, he is the more excusable, because many
others of his Coat in these times are not only martial directors, but
Commanders and Actors in open field, making Tents their Temples, and singing Te
Deum with the noise of the Canon, so that those Wars which are now in motion,
may be called The holy Wars, being directed and managed most, by such
Ministers.

And here I will insert a late passage of a great provincial Governor, and the
oldest Martialist of Ampelona, who coming to visit a great Archflamin, that is
now a Navall General, He sent to desire him to have a little patience, for
he was dispatching some Captains and other Officers, who were to go
presently to Sea upon a design of consequence. The provincial Governor
staying not, the Archflamin went the next day to excuse himself to him. The
Veteran Governor hearing he was there, sent to desire him to stay a little,
for he was newly entered into a piece of Saint Austin, de Civitate Dei, and as
soon as he had read it over, he would attend his Reverence.

But to give Ramundas this prime Minister of state in Ampelona (for that is his
title) his due, (and I honor him the more, because the first great act he did
when he came to the helm was the alliance with Druina) The Royal Vine has
done notable feats by the strength of his Counsel.

He has debelld the Eusebians who formerly stood upon the strength of their
own guard, having sundry maritime and inland Forts, and places of fastness for
their security, but they are brought to subsist now merely by his mercy,
having no other assurance for their safety, but his pleasure.

And it seems he easily dispenses with himself to perform, what his two
immediate predecessors were bound by sacred tie, and Article to observe. For
he has declard long since,

That what the one did, he did it out of fear; what the other, his great
sire, did, he did it out of love (though he had his ears often stoppd with
Cotton at their petitions) but for his part, he neither loved them, nor feared
them.

And it must be granted, this was one of the greatest weaknesses Ampelona
had, for foren Princes and some of her own Grandees, servd themselves of the
Eusebians, as of matches to set her on fire within doors at pleasure.

The ancient Elmes that lifted up their heads so high in their governments, which
some held as confidently as if it had bin their inheritance, and so lessened
the opinion of the vassal to the Sovereign, he has removed, and placd
therein inferior Trees, not of so ancient a stock, whereof some are
trienniall, others during pleasure.

He has mervailously enhanc'd the revenues, and perquisits of the Crown, to
many millions more than it was, though with a pitiful excoriation of the
poorer sort, so that from 14. they are mounted to 20. millions in the last
estimat that was made.

He has clammerd over the huge neighboring hills, making his way by the swords
point, and settled one of his own vassals, though opposd by the Cedar and Olive
to be one of the Sovereign Princes of Bombycina, and in the passage seized
upon the territories of the Princely Pine who made half resistance, but having
effected his purpose, he freely surrendered it, yet reserving still to himself
a key to enter Bombycina at pleasure.

He has disturbed the passage Elaiana had got through the vale, from
Bombycina to Rhenusium.

He has so scourgd the Sycomore, who had offended him, that he has sent him
to wander up and down for another soil to plant himself in.

He has regaind, though with infinite toil and treasure those Islands
Elaiana had a while rooted her self in near Bombycina.

And lastly, to bring you nearer home, he gave the Olive many smart knockes
when he thought to have planted himself in the confines of his Country, which
proud too hot a soil for the Elaianians, which made one of them to leave
behind this motto upon the walls of a forsaken Fort.

O Ampelonians, if we had been such as the world takes us to be, and you such
as you have been wont to; be our deeds had been yours, and yours ours.

These high feats the Vine has done since he was proppd by this Genius; And
behold lately a mighty blessing droppd down from heaven upon him, and all
Ampelona, viz. a rare masculine branch sprung out of him, and the lovely Olive,
his Royal mate, after twenty three years inoculation, which has transformd
all the world to wonder. So that Ampelonas great Queen may answer her teeming
neighbors as the Lioness did the Fox, who reproaching her of sterility and
such slownesse in breeding said, it is true, I breed slowly, but what I bring
forth is a Lion; the application is obvious; And I hope the Lion of the Tribe
of Judah will be graciously pleased to make this inexpected regal late
offspring a Prince of peace, that his birth may quash all far fetchd reaches
of ambitious policy, and put Christendom in a new mould of peace, least,
besides those parts wherein she is already stuck, she feel in other of her
members, the prickles of that huge Bramble, who has it for the prime part of
his Letany, That intestine wars be still fomented twixt Christian Princes;
And good reason he has to pray so, for the greatest arms he ever usd
against them were their own divisions.

Nor is Druinas Monarch destitute of prudent and strenuous Counsel, though he
need it not so much, for he can see better without spectacles; Nor is his
favor like that of the Vine, and Olive's ingrossd all by one, but every one of
his prime independent Ministers is his Favorite within the bounds of his own
Office; He has an Intelligence to every sphere, amongst whom he diffuseth
his beams, according as they shall move in a regular motion every one in his
own Orb, and stand subordinate to him their primus Motor; And indeed, as the
systeme and symphony of music is not made by one or two, but diversity of
strings and notes, so political harmony consists in the correspondence of the
greatest Ministers, and their unanimous resolution after some conflict of
opinions, for as fire breaks out of flint by concussion, so wisdom and truth
issues out of the agitation of argument.

Tamisond never flourished more with building and bullion, and bravery of all
things. Her great Sanctuary, the greatest take all dimensions together, of any
in the Europaean world, which by the iron teeth of time and injury of the
meteors had so mouldred away, that she was upon point of being reducd to her
first principles, a confusd Chaos of stone and rubbish, is like to look as
youthful as ever she did;

When the Eagle built his nest, every bird brought in a feather; And certainly
a good spirit cannot dwell in him, who grumbles to send a stone toward the
bearing up of the House of the Almighty.

Nor does Tamisond increase this way by houses, Palaces or streets only, but
she has a whole new Town reard up lately to enlarge her skirts; And whereas
before, her walls were of light combustible matter, they are now of a new solid
structure and stuff.

Though some would think, that in regard she draws on in this kind so much to
the West, she is toward her declining times; and they ground this augury upon
the height of bravery and profuseness she is come to, which commonly bring
with them, luxury and softness, and they have been always observed to be
symptoms of a waining state.

For navall strength, since Druina sat in Thetis lap, and had her white cliffs
washd with her waves, she was never so well appointed; Not long since, the
world thought she had been fallen to so low an ebb, that she was not able to
set out a fleet Royal to Sea, which made some so insult over her, that they
questiond her Sovereignty, yea in her own waves; But lately she has appeard
like her self, and put them all to silence, unbeguiling the world of this
erroneous opinion.

The late moving Castle she has built, has already purchasd such renown;
that it is confessd by all her neighbors, there never floated the like upon
salt waters.

She has restord a Foreign Emperor to his right; And it is the duty of
Sovereign Princes, to see wrong vindicated, and right take place though
amongst Barbarians being sought unto* And besides the glory of that action,
there is a special benefit accrues thereby to Druina, for that nest of base
ravenous birds which so much impeachd her commerce is pulld down, and many of
her own plants, who languished in that hot scorching soylein most miserable
slavery, brought home.

They cannot therefore have their hearts well planted in them, who repine at
such contributions which the sages of the law have once avouched legal, since
they daily see such necessary and glorious effects thereof;

And the (legal) leavies the Sovereign raysers of the subject, are as vapors
which the sun exhales up into the middle Region (the womb of the Meteors)
which fall down afterward in sweet silver showers to fructify the earth.

The golden chain of policy has been always held to be, That the defense of
a kingdom is the office of the Prince, the honor of the Peers, the service
of the Soldier, and the charge of the subject, for Qui sentit commodum,
sentire debet and onus.

Add hereunto, that allegiance is an act of reciprocation; as it binds the
King to protect, so it ties the subject to contribute, and by this
correspondence there is a quid pro quo.

But as in Druina, so in all other Forests, it is usual for the Poplars to
clash their branches, and still make a noise at the present times and
soloecismes, in government, though they know neither the disease, nor the
remedy. They think to discern the least moat in the body politic, building
certain fantastic forms of ruling, and soothing their shallow imaginations,
that they could set the state in such frames, the particular application
whereof would prove absurd and gross impertinencies.

Touching eminent or imminent danger, though there be some Arcana Imperii in
every state, which the Sovereign and his sages should only know and not
disperse amongst the vulgar, It was apparently visible, how the fairest flower
of Druinas diadem, the dominion of the Seas was aymd at, and like to be pluckd
off, was it not high time then for her to rigge her vessels, and put her self
upon an extraordinary guard?

Moreover they are far wide who think Druina can join security and peace
together, as long as the Olive with the Cedar and the Vine are up in actual
arms by Sea and Land hard before her, for a peace may be clapd up between
them with that suddenness, that some of those forces which are now in motion
may inexpectedly fall upon her skirts. Touching Ampelona some have been
overheard to say that the late invasion upon her Islands for relief of
Petrina sticks still in her stomach but half disgested, thinking she has
not repaird her honor to the height, nor taken equal revenge according to the
rules of retaliation, by that successful repulse only.

And for Elaiana some hold (though I do not) never yet made hearty peace with
any Eusebian Prince, and the peace she makes proceeds either from disability or
unseasonablenes to hurt. And since she holds the Canons of the last great
Counsel (whither it was said the holy Ghost was usd to be sent in cloake-bagges
from Petropolis) in so much reverence and authority as the sacred Oracles
themselves which were immediately inspird from heaven, of which Canons one was,
that Haereticis (meaning the Eusebians) non est tenenda fides; since I say that
Elaiana stands so readily appointed and so near, it would very ill become the
policy of Druina, to let her vessels lie rotting upon the Carine, and not to be
ready upon a preventive guard, least she re-incurre that aspersion which in
former ages stuck fowlly to her, which was to be wise, a posteriori, after the
blow was given, when Hannibalis Ante Portas.

And now that all the neighboring Forests, which had been formerly shaken,
and riven with the thunderbolts of war, did admire and envy the sweet peace
and serenity of Druina, her Royal Oak being only -- Medijs tranquillus in
undis; Behold an unhappy mist did rise in the North in Cardenia, (and Cardenia
is known to be much subject to mists.) Some say Cardenia has the same
quarrel to her Sovereign, that she has to the Sun for dwelling too far
distant from them: but it was discovered that this cloud was engendered of the
exhalations of diverse discontented spirits, specially some of the great ones,
who did suscitat the inferior sort of Flamins, that depended upon them for
their subsistence to vent seditious doctrine against the Hierarchy, and
chiefest governors in holy things, fearing that by a post-liminous way
something should be re-annexd both to Church and Crown, which had always
been possessd by them time out of mind.

These obstreperous Sermocinators (who in Cardenia sway as much, if not more,
upon the conscience then the Loyalists else where do) make easy impressions
upon the minds of the vulgar, specially the femalls who first broak out into
acts of violence, so that it may be said this sedition came in, as sin did
first into the world, by the female sex, who relying upon the immunity of
their kind, did many unbefitting and strange barbarisms, little tending to the
honor of Cardenia, And with these the meaner sort of mechanikes concurd, and
at last the tallest Elmes appeard, so that the whole Forest was in a fearful
combustion, and the Bells every where rung backward, the Regalia seizd upon, and
government thrust quite of the hinges.

A strange league is made without consent of royal Majesty, point blank
against the laws of Cardenia, and nothing will serve their turn but the utter
extinguishing of the greatest Luminaries of the Church, and the abjuration of
whatsoever the late royal Oak (who they glory to have bin the most religious
and learned Prince that ever wore Diadem) had done in point of
ecclesiastical government. The meaner sort of the dispensers of sacred Oracles
(who of all other, were the greatest monsters of ingratitude to their
Sovereign (who had found out a way not long before to augment and a scertaine
their stipends, and free them from that servile kind of clientele they stood
in to the seculars) in lieu of pious documents and wholesome doctrines tamper
chiefly with matters of state, and out of a fanatique zeal minister more fuel
to increase the flames;

they cried out that the ready way to return to Petropolis, was, to pass by
Druina; that her form of public prayer (though they acknowledge the first
Compilers thereof to be glorious Martyrs) was mere Idolatry.

This little tended to the honor of Cardenia, for all her neighbors cried out
against her, that she should cast such a brand upon the Eusebian Religion, as
to loose all respects of passive obedience, if need had bin, ( for subjects
should be willowes, and not Oaks) and to stand in open defiance and arms
against their natural liege Lord; And where people run together and join in
arms (be it for defense or offense) without a Sovereign head, I know what
term it deserves, all the world over. The sages of Druina consult how to
quench these flams. Some were of opinion, that, all the while they broak not
out into incursions by land, or depredations at Sea, nor took in foreign force,
nor did any externe act of violence; it was not dishonorable for Druina, to
look on a while, yet pinch them in commerce every way, and to be sure to keep
them at the staves end. Bombycina has a saying, That the Prince, who upon
every commotion of the subject, rusheth presently into open war, is like him
who sets his own house a fire to roast his eggs. Kings have many ways to
meet with their people, besides effusion of blood, and profusion of treasure,
they have long reaches. Non nost longas Regibus esse manus?

Nor is Phlebotomy, in the body politic, as well as the natural, prescribed
for all diseases. Some of the wisest Emperors have gone to work with mutinous
subjects by cunctation, as the Sun did to take away the passengers cloak, not
as the ruffling wind; for Royal Majesty like the Sun has her rays also,
which dazzleth the eyes of disloyalty, and glancing upon rebellion, makes it
melt to nothing, like a Gorgons head, or a Bear reard up of snow. But it has
been the fate of the best and potentst Monarchs to have water thrown
sometimes into their Wine by tumultuous subjects, witness the Vine, and the
OLIVE hard by.

But I trust Cardenia will not be so ungrateful to Druina, as to receive
Plummes from her so many years, and now to throw the stones at her.

The Thistle I hope will not offer to clash against the Sovereign Rose,
considering the multiplicity of advantages she has by her.

And the single Lion (though rampant) will be better advisd then set himself
against three, considering how often he has felt their paws: A good
instrument may (by some ill favored accident) be out of tune, but being put in
again, the music will be as good as ever, I hope Cardenia will prove so.

And now will I put a period to this parley, this Iargon of Trees, for I can
find them no further matter of discourse, unless I should make them to
prophecy, and so out-runne their Epoch. Many more things could have been
couchd here (as a discerning Reader may well perceive) which I leave to future
ages, and transmit to the post-Nati, when the times shall be enfranchizd, and
posterity manumitted: For there be some Historical truths, which are like the
Medlar not ripe enough (to be written) till they be rotten: Nor was this shadow
of Trees dark enough for them, it being my intention at first not to pursue or
press this allegory so far as to inslave my matter unto it, and so put it in
a kind of stocks, but that I did obtain leave of my self sometimes by
obvious and easy expressions to comply with the Readers capacity; Otherwise
he might have thought it to have been some senseless phantasticke Romance,
which might have brought him to that pass, that he could not have been able
as he went along to have seen the Wood for Trees; No, it will appear that I
labor to bring him often into the Plains, and that I was very careful to
shun the bogs, for they are dangerous, and there is no state without them.

Wherefore I hope this knotty ill twisted piece, will pass current without
exception, offense or calumny; and that my impartial dealing will serve for a
Pale to fence out the Goats from my Forest, though I must confess there may
some few criticismes or grains of brown salt, and small dashes of vinegar be
found here and there, to make the discourse more sapid, but this tartness is
far from any gall or venom, wherewith the pages of some Modern Authors of
our next transmarin neighbors do usually swell, and are yet exposd to vent by
public authority though they writ flat and plain without any disguise at
all; I presume you have tasted no such bitterness here, albeit I might have
done it with more privilege and good manners, writing under types. No; you
shall find no black satyrs range in my woods; if there be any, they are
white harmless ones, and drawing near to the nature of Fayries.

A VOTE.
FOR Conclusion, my incessant vows and hearty orisons to heaven early and late
shall be, that the high Majesty which is here meant by the Oak, may in vigor,
and strength of constitution (if it be within the possibility of nature)
attain unto the age of the Oak, which is observd to exceed all other
terrestrial creatures in longaevity. May he be to his enemies as the Oak is to
the Olive, which as the Arbolists observe, shrinkes away to nothing, if he be
but near the roots of the Oak; may Honor set up her stand in him, and victory
her tent under his branches; may he be like that blessed Tree planted on the
waters side (as he is already surrounded and strengthened with waters) which
brings forth her fruit in due season, whose leaf fades not, and prospers in
all his undertakings.

Long may his fruitful Vine infolliat and clasp about him with embracements of
Princely love, that their souls may transmigrat into each other: Long may the
dew of heaven distill upon them, to make them bourgeon and propagat amongst
themselves, until they be encircled with a large row of young gemmes, and
cions of their own royal stock, which to the fullness of earthly
contentment, they may see shoot up and germinat, and ingrafted also upon other
Princely scutcheons and shields, and so grow ripe to succeed them here, when
they shall be transplanted to the celestial Paradise, to become true Jerusalem
Oaks, to flourish there for ever with the Tree of life, and behold him who
troad the Wine press, and once suffered upon a Tree, to purchase for them,
that shall be truly ingrafted into him here, Palms of Victory, and
immarcessible ghirlands of glory and triumph to all eternity.

So prays, The loyallst, and lowliest of their Majesty's, VOTARIES and
VASSALS, James Howell.
