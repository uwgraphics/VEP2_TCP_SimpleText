Here begins A short monycyon, or counsel of the cure and governance of
a household / according unto policy: taken out of a pystle of a great learned
man, called Bernarde syluestre.

the foreground cut away (McKerrow 67b)

HEre good and devout Chrystyans / first take most head / and give most
dylygence to order your self / and all youres, unto our lord according unto
the poor lesson that comes after: and than se well unto the substance and
gydynge of your house / and goods. Se first that peace be in the house / and
that you agree all together, for else al your goods will soon goo to naught.
Than (after ye common proverb) cut your thonges: after or according unto your
ledder. Spend according unto your gaynes: gettings or rentes / and not
above. It is also good polycye: to have one years rent / or an years gaynes in
store for chances / which is not contrary unto christy anyte: where extreme
or verey streyte need: is not perceived in the neighbor. A neglygent or
retcheles person may soon set on fine, and destroy great substance. Have
therefore a good iye / and guard unto the dylyge^ce of your servants, for
under them your goods may soon mynysshe and be wasted before you know /
beware or have knowleg thereof. if your goods begin to waste: better is / and
less rebuke for you to absteyne / and withdraw your charges: than to fall in
to nedynes / or danger. An old proverb. Qui plus expendit quam reru^ copia
tendit. Non admiretur si paupertate grauetur. That is. who so done spend
beyond their faculte.
No marvel though with need they grieved be.


It is therefore a great prouydence and good foresyght often to count / and
compare your goods / and your gaynes with your expe^ses. Often to ouerse your
good: shall be necessary. For your beestes may take hurt for defaute of fode
(all though they nothing axe) ne complain. The sleep of ye housbande: makes
a fat dong hylle. And the iye of ye master, a fast horse. That is to mean
that the presence of the master: in every corner: is much profitable.
Sumptuous and costlye weddynges, or brydales, ben damage / without honor.
Expe^ces done upon war / ben more honorable / than profitable. Better is to
suffer some wrong, and to bye peace than to make war / or to keep war. Cost
made upon prodygal persons / is clearly lost. Cost made upon kyn or fre^des /
is reasonable. Feed your household servants with honest common fare / without
delycates. For the servant that is made a gloton shall never after mende his
manners. Glotony is vile fylthy / and stynkynge and will make the neglygent and
careless person soon roten and short life. Mean fedynge with scarcyte: is unto
the dilygent person pleasant and profitable. Upon the holy days and high
festes: give your household plentye of mete: but seldom and few delycates. For
the use of delycate fode / will sone mar a good servant. Let glotonye and
thy purse strive / and go to law together / and beware thou well which part
thou take / but for the most part always hold with the purse. For glotonous
men of law and the witnessers: done speak of all affeccio^. but the purs
brings in plain euydence and proof / the empty barn and the empty bag. But
if very nygardy shut up thy purse / than art not thou an eue^ judge. For
nygardy is a folysshe and nedeles fere / and ever living in pouerte / and
hurdeth and muckerythe up: he can not tell for whom. if thou have plenty of
corn: desire no derth For those persons that of covetous mind done procure
or desire derthe done procure and desire the death of the pore / and shall be
accused: as homicides and mansleers / sell thy corn better chepe unto thy
neighbor (al though he were thy enemy) than unto strangers, For an enemy is
sometime sooner vaynquysshed and ouercomen by a kind deed / than by the sword.
Be never at debate with thy neighbor / but rather study and labor to be at
one. For thou canste have none so sure a castle / or guard of thy life / as is
love and frendshyp of thy neighbor / if thou suspecte the women of thy house:
let other persons rather show yt / than thou should be over busy to try out
the matter. For though it were of thy own wife, or the wife of thy husband: it
were better unknown. For ones known it is never cured / the wound is with
out remedy. if any remedy be / it shall be when like chance is herd of other
persons. The least and most easy way therein is to dissimule ye matter though
it were pryuely known / and pretend yngnoraunce without any quarrel or
countenance / but rather by a dyscrete ghostly father let the parties be
reformed that sin be not co^tynued A noble heart / and high gentyl mind /
will never search of women's matters. Ashrewe will sooner be correctid by smiling
or laughyng / than by a staff / or strokes. The best way to keep a woman good
/ is gentle intrety and never to let her know that she is suspecte / and ever
to be counceyled and informed with loving manner. an old woman unclean of
living (if the law would suffer) should be buried quycke. Let your clothing
or array be in amene / another vile ne precious but always fair and honest / and
of sad and not of wanton fasshyon. A costelye garment beyond: or above the
state and degree of the person / is a sign and token of little wit. For a
woman yt has suffycyent array / to desire new and change / is a sign of
little sadness. Trust him rather for thy friend that so^what does for the /
than him that does offer him self / saying. I am yours in all I can and may.
For in words is great plente of friends a true friend loves at all times and
never fails at need. There is no co^paryson of riches / unto a faythefull
friend. Never repute ne think him thy friend / that does praise / or bost the
unto thy face / or in thy presence. when you give counsel unto a friend / say
this seems best unto me / not thus you must nedely do. For you may sooner
get rebuke or blame for your counceyle if it pryue not / than thank, for
your good counceyle: though it speed well / if mynstrelles / iogulers / or
iesters come to thy house / say thou haste no lodging for such iesters / you
keep nether ynne nor alestake. For if you take pleasure in their pastymes you
ben full like to have another wife shortly after whose name is called pouerte /
or beggry. if you fortune to come where they ben / and begin somewhat to delecte
in their matters: I advise you dyssimule and take upon you that you herd them
not / ne set any thing thereby. For if they perceive and se you but laugh: they
will take that for an ernest to cry largess and to have reward And so
importune will they be / and so shamfully crave: that you shall be yrke and
weary of them / and perauenture they will fall to rebukyng / braulyng / and
scolding / so that you shall be feign / and glade: to give so^what for fere
unto those galowe clapers / worthy in deed to be hanged up. For I tell you /
god is not pleased with yt occupacyon / except it be (as scant tolerable or
alowable) among princes lords / and high estates. Now for your servants /
if you have a servant of high proud mind and stubburne stomach put him away
lest after he do you harm / and so do him that always does praise your
manners in all things. For a flaterer is worse than an enemy / your enemy
cannot lightly deceive you, but your servants or your neighbors that done
praise you: ben surely about to deceive you. If you have a bashful and dreadful
servant, and find him faithful, tha^ love him and cherysshe him as your own
natural child. Make your byldynges rather for need, than for pleasur. For the
appetyte of byldyng for pleasur shall never have end / till pouerte teache wit
some what to late. Be loathe to sell your heritage, and if you must need / sell.
Sell not to great persons / but rather for less unto the lower persons.
Better is to sell than to borow by vsery. For vsery is like a thief yt would
warn you before what harm he would do unto you / If you bye or bargayne / be
not botye fellow with great persons. And though he be under you / yet strive not
with him lest he put his part unto your better / or master. In all things
keep truly and faithfully your bond and promise / according unto your
couenaunte. Due temporaunce is a thing of great honestye in a household / let
therefore your drink wine / ale or bear be temporate. Strong drink is more
pleasant / than wholesome. The wyseman says / that sobre drink is the health
both of soul and body And the wise and learned person, will be right well
content with little drink / and that shall not trouble the stomach, but
rather cause sweet and wholesome sleep / and of the contrary done come many
incommodytes as there does follow. who so ever among many and diverse strong
drynkes / with abundance thereof, is sobre may be called an erthly god / or a
god upon earth / wrestle not therewith if you do my counsel. And if by chance
you be in company / and begin to feel the drink work / arise and depart / a
sleep is more meite for you, than any company. who so by words would excuse
dronke^nes: does openly declare his own disease. The knowledge and judgment of
wynes: does nothing become a young person. If a physycyon or surgyon use to be
drunk / let him not have ye cure of your disease / ne let no ne of them take
experyence / and learn in you: how to cure / or hele another. For though they
be well learned and have not experye^ce / it is no wisdom to let them prove
their co^nyng upon you. Great gay horse / and little pretty dogs: leave you unto
lords and ladies. A bygge labourynge horse / and a mastyfe / or a curre dog:
ben good to keep your house. As for hawks / hounds / and huntyng dogs do
spend more tha^ they do get, they ben mete and according for states: to set
idle servants on work but far vnaccordynge ben they: for busbandes and
ware householders. It is no wysdom to make your own chylder stewardes or rulers
of your household or goods. Foles and neglygente or careless persons: have
many mysfortunes. For that is their common excuse when any thing is wrong,
they say than / that chance or mysfortune was cause thereof. I say not nay but
that chance or mysfortune may fall. But who so does follow wysdo^ learning /
and dyscrecyon, shall seldom accuse mysfortune. For delyge^ce / warenes / and
good head, done seldom company with mysfortune. But yet more seldom shall you
se mysfortune and slouthe or negligence, departed in sondre, for they done
co^munely company to gyther. The sluggard says god will help him / and so
long he trusts there unto, till he be brought unto beggary. For god by ye
wise man does send the sluggarde (for example) unto the ant or pismere, to
learn to labor. For man says Job is borne to labor / as a bird to fly.
Keep you therefore but few idle persons or men. And watch you and take good
head unto every person of your house / and ever ponder / wey / and consydre
your exspences / with your gaynes / or gettings. First get and bring in / and
than spend. For it is no good husbandry to borowe. And when ye wex aged /
trust rather unto god / than unto your chylder / or friends / that you send
before you / you shall be sure to find. No cofre / chyst / ne tower may be
more sure to keep treasure than is heaven. Let not therefore ye poor pass you.
what you give to them, you give unto Christ. And of that you leave behind you,
appoint it unto every person his part. For better were for you nothing to
leave / than that strife and debate should be made / conscience blemysshed / and
god offendyd / for your goods. Trust them best to do for your soul / not
that done love or say they done love your soul / but that you done perceive
and conjecture, done love their own soul. Make your testament every year new
/ and surely sealyd by wytnes. Lay it where (when need is) it may be found /
no man is sure how to end his life. The most sure way, to dye well / is well
to live / which he grant us yt bought us our lord god and most sweet
sauyoure Ihesu christ. Amen.
