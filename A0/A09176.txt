AT HARLEM. Printed with Gylis Romaen. M.D.XCVII.

(...) To the worshipful and grave Cittizin of London / Mr. A. T. with others of
my lovinge acquayntans in the Royal Exchange: grace and peace wyshed to be
compfortablie felt both in life and at the instant of death / through Jesus
Christ our Lord according to Moses / the Psalms and the Prophetts / Amen.
Neither sea particion nor distans of plase cann be any lawful excuse to be
so silent here / as absent there / but rather the bond of love considered /
with remembrans of your gentle favor / I dare no longer refrain my penn / but
as to sum I wrote the last September / so thus printed to you and the rest of
my freynds this December. Whereunto as I am sturred by dent of Christian duty /
and the fullfillinge of the oulde proverb: Better to late then never: so I
trust your approved courtesies will requite that saying with a another as
ancient: foone enough if well enough. Knowinge that you accept as well the
plain and well meaning as of either gloriouse words / or eloquent writing.
Otherwise I conceyve not / how this small valor to yours over valuynge / can
either be soon enough or well enough. By whose acceptance / God grant both
the many writers / and the few readers of this age / no less to abhor the
ticklinge and erringe pe^ne / the ytchinge ear / and flatteringe tongue for
glory or gain / then to be only gladd under assurans the searcher of thoughts
does se so clearly the depthe and intent of hearts: whether guyded by devyne
grace or moved by corrupted nature. Wherefore saying every good gift as /
preachinge writing / edifying speches / or the woreks of charptie procedinge
from learned or unlearned co^mes from the Lord: I wyshe such good instruments
possessing honest life with there rare gyfts / to rejoice and be grateful for
being the mowthe or hand of God / so mercifully chusinge theme to be vessels
for his glory / furtherouse to his church and profitable members for the
commune welthe. And great reason they should do so: saying good teachers and
famous writers on the one side / labor to wynn Disciples to Jesus Christ / and
not to theme selves / vndergoinge there great pains throw love and good
conscyens to beneficte many / and not for the expect of any vain glory. And
on the other side / the godly rytche to rejoice for that by the visible word
and invisible grace they be taught to add St. James worcks with St. Paul's faith
/ co^cording theme to gethers by there words and practys as inseparable
companions / in stead the greater forte by there cowld charity and careless
lyves seem to rent theme a sunder / the which in deed is more impossible then to
devyde heat from the son or shadow from the body. For as the one
iustifiethe before men here on yerthe / so does the other before Gods
trybunall seat in heaven: the which worcks of Gods children of what quality or
quantity soever / are to be considered as the effects from the cause: whether
the hand in gevinge / the tongue in speaking / the pe^n in writing / or the
heart in longinge to do more or better / all which as obedyent daughters do wait
and attend in there degrees on there mother faith / the very apprehe^dinge
instrument of Jesus Christ God and man / and the hydde^ root gevinge joyce and
sapp to the manifould branches of the lords trees far or nere / or whether
more or less / as the provident God has appointed. And yet the least portion
of this faith / dyscearned by her effects is ynouhe to attain to the endless
crown of glory. So graciouse is our God / in acceptinge the readiness of
willinge / where wantethe the ability of doing. My worsipfull brethren /
you know there be many goodlye trees now a days in the wide orchard of this
world / either out / or but only in / and not of Christ his little garden /
who bear grene leaves and fair blossoms / but alack either small fruict or
none at all / and that by a wrong understanding of the compfortable article
of justification of faith / presuminge there by to be that they are not / to
have that they want / and to obtain that they shall not / vnlest they do
better reconsyle St. Paul's faith and St. James worcks to gether / whereby to
reject there saul's hope for to be saved up there naked and bare faith / which
the Apostle compares to a dead corpse wthout the spirit / more fytt for the low
grave / then for the upper grownd. But blessed is that tree planted by the
watersyde of Gods spirit and word / which brings for the her fructe in due
season. As though fruicts out of season / be rather vnsavery / then pleasant or
sauery / as they are in deed / not only the worcks of our present Papists and
Aunabaptists / the one wthout faith / and the other as void of the true
Christ: but such persons as be neither of both: that is neglecters of the
word / absenters from the Sermons / followers of there pleasures / prorogers
of charitable and compassionat duties until there death when they are de
prived of the use of there goods. And yet I grant to sum yt is a seasonable
time by such as were so exercised in there life / and wthout superstitiouse
meaning at there decease. Otherwise question leff it is out of season. For now
is the time under life to help one another by praper / cowncell / gevinge / or
lendinge / but when soul or breathe is gone / neither angels nor Apostles can
geve any help or remidie. The poor may say to sum ritche in these days /
as well as in former times by funeral aulmes / gathamercy death: as the hosts
reckonyng with her gest less willinge to lodge in her hows / then his tired
horse / made low curtesy in the morning to the beast / and seyde gathamercy
horse: foryf thou had not been tired / thy Mt. had not brought me this
money. Luke as these prorogers of well doing having wherwth / are here justly
reproved / so the right users of Gods blessinghs in time oportune are to be
commended / and God for there liberal hand to be praised and magnified.
Wherefore first let Stuards of larger portions make proof to theme selves / and
to others of there savinge faith worckinge by charity and that in due time /
whether yt be in gevinge therefully / or by lendinge to the godly poor in the
pinche of extremetie / or by door aulmes to the commune miserable and hungerie
/ without this could and usual forewell: God help you. Next let men of meaner
degree spare sum excess and un necessary expenses for to follow the good
example of there betters. And lastly the meanest of all wantinge corporal
ability / let theme likewise approve there faith to be moving and justifieng
by the works of the spirit: as true love and zeal to Gods glory / earnest
affection to Gods word and verity / pitiful and merciful hearts / the thyrst
and hunger of well doing / there hatred to herysie and Hypocrisy / or by
gevinge of sownd and good cowncell: and by leavinge a religiouse and virtuous
conversation to the magnifieng of God and there holy profession. These also be
acceptable worcks to the lord / who in mercy will crown theme as his own
gyfts and not as there is. The regard of which promised crown / set before the
eyes of your mynds / will no less mitigate your greifes either in ward or
ontwarde / then kyndle spiritual joy / with the longinge of your liberty from
this terrestiall tabernacle / whereby your noble souls to enjoy the heavenly
inheritans with the invisible and tryumphant church now singinge as the
Isralitishe Virgins sang the song of Moses for there delyverans out of Egypt
and Pharo his bondage: evenso the souls in Heaven do sing to the Lord
everlastinge praises for delyveringe them from the boude of satan and there
worldly miseries: and likewise do singe the song of the Lamb whereby the
virtue of Christ and his redemption is continually magnified. For as the oulde
fathers eatinge the paschal Lamb made a jubilee and gave the Lord thancks: so
those enfranchised spirits / felinge the light and liberty of Gods kingdom /
geve thancks to Christ the Lamb / to the sytter on the throne / and to the
spirit procedinge from both. Opraye for a fore tasie and sum sippinge of this
great supper where with a far of to be sum what acquaynted / for the better
certificate of a more fullnes to ensue / by which to increase your earnest
longinge upwards and to decrease all overlyking here beneathe: that so the more
felingly you may say with David / I shalve satisffied when thy glory appears
/ which will be a greater sight to behowld / then that which Peter and John saw at
Christ his tra^sfiguration on mowne Thabor / even the fullnes of the
inco^prehensible dietie the essens of the gloriouse persons inscrutablie one
God. Let us then be myndfull to say with the Prophett / my soul is a thirst
for God o when shall I appear before his presons. If you Mr. A. do still move
and scur / love and lyve to the Lord / then I mosie heartily salute you / and
the rest so affected: but if otherwise / the spirit in heaven and the body in
the grave ere this be aryved: then God grant us behynd in the battle to geve
glory and thancks to him for his contynuing grace and final mercies here
beneathe to his / and for his everlastinge compforthes a bove to the souls of
his servants restinge with him in peace and iope. That so the Lord havinge his
spirit / I may the bowlder to that conjecture set that oulde father as a glass
for London professors to look in: not alone in his zeal to the gospel / with
his frequent presens at Sermons / and with good further ans to such instruments
/ but to the poor presoners in and about London presons he was known to be
bowntiful and merciful. Again how often and willingly has be Employed his
money for commune profict as well as for private? what pains and travel has
he taken to make peace and to end controversies? how many men of worship and
members of the lower hows in most parlame^t times have been worshipfullie
entertained at his table for there zeal to religion? how many poor scholars
and students in the arts has he no less perely the^ liberally geven unto?
besides his large distributions to Godly and desolate widows. And which is more
/ how many in the country of worr are bownd to praise God for his outstretched
hand so far from London? wherein he procured the knowledge of God for great
ignorans: being such a show toke^ to patrons of benefices / as when he
franckly gave so good a lyvinge to a learned preacher / he reserved neither
leg nor arm of that lyvinge to him self / as all covetous patrons do. God
grant yt be accordingly performed by labor and life as it was of him first and
last intended. For as gyfts blind the eyes of sum Judges: so fatt lyvings
cool the first zeal of many persons and vicars. For inward alterations do
often follow the stayne of strange titles. Now whether this was a tree bringing
forth fructe in due season or out of season / judge you besides the erection
of a schole as I remember in worr. And there fore as St. Paul would him self to
be imitated non otherwise then he did Christ: even so I wish the Lords
Stewards of better degree in that exchange / to follow this their fellow me^ver
as he followed Christ and the worthier examples of his predecessors. Trustinge
you will thinck this report to proceed more for desire of imitation / then of
any intent to tyckle him with adulation / being peradventure gone or at least of
such distans a sunder. To conclude / both hearing and saying such evident
practys of good worcks in this town of Harlem so far short of our monarchall
government by sownde professors and others of erroniouse opinious: I was drive^
the rather to this presumption / as one sorry to behoulde such blind opiniates
so far to outrun very many professors in my natyve country in the outward
worcks of charity and by hearing that the ignorants are so affected unto
theme for yt / where by the rather there might be a quycknyng with a godly
emulation on our side / ere the axe come to the root of the tree. 1597.

Now Gentle Reader.
Like as the great resort to that famous Edifice / are of sundry titles and
degrees: so the complete number walkinge and taulkinge there be as contrary in
mind and disposition / as of trade and caullinge / A plase where God / truth
and Equity / with there direct contraries are sum times spoken of to Gods
glory / and to the service of Satan. For as among diseased and infectiouse
persons / all be not taken with that sickness / but sum do escape and be
scottfre: so I partly know the like fredome from spiritual infection by Gods
mercy in sum members of that populouse assembly. The Lord multiply that
number / and increase his bego^n graces in theme / and also convert or
confownde all perniciouse lurckers preasinge thither so contrary minded. As
you take time and space to make your lawful bargains and co^tracts: so have
you now and then convenie^t leisure to talk and co^ferr between those pillars
of the omnipotent and allseinge God / of religion and good life so necessary
at all seasons / but in especial now when the sweerde of Gods justice semes to
be shaken over you there / as well as us here / threatnyng direful wars famyne
confusion of good order and strange sycknesses: by which the long suffering God
will have his hand to be selt / when his gentle voice cannot be heard / whereby
both proud and dissolute flesh to stowpe and to stand in dread of him so
wilfully refusinge to serve and obey him. The screptures geves no liberty /
nor exe^ptethe person nor plase to be sile^t of Goda^d his glory / much less
to be prophanly occupied: but rather byndethe sum devine exercise in convenient
measure every where. As whether you eat or drinck / or what soever you do /
etc. Likewise in all times and places: the texts you know well ynouge for
knowledge is rife / the lord grant grace and virtue therwth to habownde.

To come now to perticulers: Aldermen.
and first to begin with the right worshipful Aldermen of the city /
repayringe thither with there fellow brethren / as well on city causes / as
for there private. To the which the blessinge of compforthe and happy succeff is
due / if God to those ends be first craved / and his deserved glory advanced by
reyellinge of inturiouse suits / and defe^dinge the poor innoce^ts. Then are
they two fowld rytche and happy / wthin and wthout and most worthy of dowble
honor / as is required of the elders of the church that lyve and govern well.
But no more of that / whose grave and worshipful persons / as they do no less
dignifie that plase and great company / then dutifullie procure the reverens
of all / evenso they addinge there religiouse affections / with there fatherly
indevers to better there well doyngs in due season / yt shall wynn general love
and lovinge hearts / besides Gods perpetual blessinge and favor / and when
they are gone / as general praises to him for there Justice piety / and equity
/ and for there redress of that which is contrary. The which is far more of
valor then all gyfts and bequests they leave behind theme: Solomon says
better is a good name then much rytches / the which St. Paul estemeth as dunge
in respect to wynn Jesus Christ / while he is to bewonne / that is to day /
and therefore he wills to do good while time is. For if there predecessors in
the days of such ignorans were so diligent to draw credit to there popish
mass and idolatrouse trashe? how much more wthout comparison ought those
worshipful elders beget love and credit in this brightness of the gospel /
first to Gods truth professed by theme / and next to there caullings and
persons. And seeing the remembrans of death / does much further the
reforminge of life: I wyshe both the exchange / city and country / to think
often on the wadde^ horse or four foted bear / so suddenly coming from other
men's doors to theires / wthout gevinge of fore knowledge / and to carry the^ a
way for ever and ever / on four men's shoulders / from there warm and
lightsome habitations / to the cowld and clapeshe ma^sions / and from there
pleasant company of wife children and family / to the fellowship of gredie
and crawlinge worms inobscuritie / next to bethinck on the wayters and
attenders on there immortal souls at the departure from there carnal coffyns
/ to a better or worce place / being either the angels of light or the
ministers of darckenes / as yt fell out on Lazarus and dives / to co^ducte
theme to incogitable pleasure / or to tearmless terror. The remembrans of this
tragedy / will verylie instruct the faithful reader to watch and pray / to
be often ner at fructeful Sermons / with purpose of practis / to abate pride and
superfluity / to bestow the more where there is necessity / to be as wary of
the world / as of a familier traitor / briefly to regard better the worcks of
mercy in due season / saying yt is written judgment wthout mercy shall be to
theme that will show no mercy. And here I wyshe you bannishe from your tables
such Atheists and machivells as be the Devils scicophants and trencher slaves
to make men laughe at there tushinge and scoffinge of religiouse matters /
being so empty of the grace of wepinge for there intolerable sins.
Wherefore as your worshipful tables be for a better company: so let your
doors and portalls in life time / and not the church porche after death be
your almeries / and sede grownd for the increase of yerthly and celestial
fructe / and let your gates be known the place where you lend to the lord /
that trusty pay master and most highest threasurer / who repayeth more then
tenn thousand for the hundred: and vouchsafe to look to the poor howshould of
faith in a another place and after a better sort / for that they be a shamed
in there need to come to your doors or to beg in the street: whose prayers
and praises is more odoriferouse and acceptable before the lord / then all
sumpteouse funerals how gloriouse soever coveringe rotten bones and wthout any
avayle to there departed souls. Neither condembninge here nor prevelie
checkinge worshipful and semely order then / according to the degrees of
persons / but the excess and wastefull spendinge of Gods creatures / both in
life and death: the which being not yours absolutely to bestow theme as you
list / but the lords (and that lent you his constituted bayliffes for your
selves and others) you shall surely answer and make accowmpte for the lavess
and msspendinge of your masters goods: as the unrighteous Stuard was put out
of office for the same fault. This abuse amended up the virtue of Gods grace
hereunto a nexed / then by your workinge faith ye provide after death to have
an heavenly habitacion / as that worldly wise Stuard providid for an earthly /
when he should be cast out: for the which providens to instruct others: the lord
commended him according to the manner of men / and not his unrighteous
dealinge. Thus doing / you prove religiouse / and profess religion for
religion sake / and not for sum other thing / as sum persons do the ministry
more for the lyvinge sake / them for Gods glory: then are you right Royal
exchangers / changed from an old into a new nature / and from followinge your
own wylls to obey the will of the lord your God. And for the spedier practys
of such desired duties / I wyshe the preachers in cyttie and country to
forbear for a time St. Paul his sweet doctrine of justification of faith /
and a another while to take in hand S. James and his justification of worcks so
rarely seen: who never the less asmoche confirmethe his fellow Apostles
doctrine in that heavenly article (proper to the greved and humbled soul) as
he terrifiethe the presumpteouse and careless liver / whose faith he compares to
the faith of tremblinge devils / as appears by there destitution of zeal to
Gods glory / or brotherly love and compassion / and yet thinck theme stlves
Christians good enough for there presens in the congregations / for there
thrustinge to the communion / or for there bare taulke of the scriptures. God
bless us from such an hypocritical faith. The possessors where of stand in
more need of the terror of the law / as first a hammer to beat theme down /
then of de gentle voice and hand of the gospel to lift theme up.

The second cumpanie be merchant venturers / and merchant retaylers / who most
rightly bear the name of changers in that reputable exchange / changinge wares
for money / and money for wares. Merchants.
And therefore our sovereign Lady in abolishing the first title (Buss) and
imposinge a new / as there by she had prudent consideration to term yt the
exchange according to the nature of that marchantlike trade: so in great
favor she bare to it and the whole City / she added thereto a regal title /
and then termed it the Royal exchange. God preserve and bless her Princely
heart with his grace and spirit / for the further and more ample advancement of
his glory / both in England / and her wonted help for other troubled
contreys a bowt her. And the lord change there hearts / or cut of there bodies
from the yerthe that wyshe or practys the contrary / to the pleasinge of Gogg
the Pope / and his Catholic king with his spanishe mines the horn of his
strength. Now that your traffyke is hyndered / navigation restrained / and
your former gaynes greatly Impaired: I wyshe you first to acknowledge the finger
of God in all this for synn: and next to wey and consider of the spiritual
marchantdise mentioned of in the gospel / with the hydden threasure not fownd
wthout paynfull digginge / and of the good merchant buyeng the preciouse pearl
/ Implieng thereby that devine rytches cannot be obtained wthout zeal and
earnest affection / wthout search and diligent sekinge / and vnlest they be
redeemed with the best things you affect / and to esteem all other marchantdise
but trifles whether from Turckie or Denice in comparison of that devine
threasure. And marck that no adventurers nor the secure or careless can find
the said hydden threasure. The Kingdom of God must be sought ere yt can
befownde: therefore let the name merchant teacht all to make singular accowmpt
of spiritual and sacred things and of the gospel / Sacraments / readinge
hearing / prayeng / Psalms and songs from the heart. O that we could love and
regard these preciouse pearls / the supernatural threasure hyd from the
worldly heart / and the gospel of Christ as they are to be esteemed / which is the
gladdest news and ioyfullest tidings / the light of the church and every soul
thereof / the preservative of the Prince / and the pyller of her Kingdom: the
which being taken a way / despised or lothed / as manna was of the lothinge
Iscalites yt must needs fall out with us as it did on that full gorged people /
when the ark of God was taken from theme: namely bloddie wars / hunger /
famine / pestilences / and confusions before and behind. If you did but sum
times wey and consider this: then would you be as desirouse of the continuans
of the gospel by due estimation of suehe a threasure for to save and defend
you from Gods wrath / as the elders of Israel coveted the prese^s of the
lords ark (the figure thereof) to save theme from the Philistines / who in there
misery crped out / saying / wherefore has the lord smitten us? let us bring
again the ark of Gods covenant a mongest us / that when it comes it may save
us from the hands of our enemies. And then as dagon could not stand / but fall
down and break his neck at the presens of Gods arck: so can neither the
second spanishe flete / the power of papists / with the indian gould be able to
stand / but rather flee and consume from the Queen of England and her
religiouse subjects / when they put this Evangelicall arck in revere^t and
hearty manner between theme and there adversaries: otherwise then the which love
and reverens / yt will be as meake a buckler at the fierce assault as the arck
of God was to the Isralites when they / there King and priest were all over
chrowen. Secondly remember that you must be changed you know not when / from
your riches / from this vital lijfe and the whole world unto a another place
paynefull or Joyful / none otherwise then the said preciouse pearl and hydd
threasure is of price and valor with you for the present time. Thinck of this /
and on him that exhortethe to be changed and renewed in the inward man /
carefully studienge to change the owld life for a new / even as you tender the
changinge of this mortality / to Immortality / of this drudgerie beneathe to
the felicity above: seeing yt is written that such as shall be burgeses there /
they must be so enfranchised here / as to be made Kings and priests to overcom
and to offer / no less then Prophetts to instruct theme selves and there
family / and al to show forth the virtues of him that has caulled theme out
of darckues into his marvelouse light.

Evil Merchants.
And further understand / that as there be honest and Godly men of your trade:
so the very contrary are both known and felt / who yet march under the
ensign of honest merchants / and would appear as religiouse as they be
covetouse or impiouse: being as great a scandale to that worshipful company
/ as corrupt lyvers and teachers do greyve the Godly learned in the
ministry. These merchants deceyve much by there painted faulshode and lipp
religion / whereby they endamage others to inritche there estate. Such is the
choice that these make of duplicitie and hypocrisy / when they affect so
little the grace of truth and simplicity. These fellows will brave yt out /
how slender so ever they be wthin / and prease to be either equal or higher
then there betters / fleinge the mean estate which is the happiest / and steal
credit by other men's valor / until they become either breakers or banckerers.
God in mercy geve such repentans for borrowinge and dealinge with many / and
to keep towche with few. Exceptinge here nevertheles such honest men as come to
decay / neither by the pride of there backs / wife / nor table / but by
shipwreck on the sea / or by trustinge the untrusty that borrow much / and
repay either little or nothing. But God that never chastises wthout cause did
se yt time to correct / for either being over gredie to aspire / or by
covetouse desire of excessive gaynes / did rather choose to write there bad
creditors names in there books / then to take present pay in there purses of
honest customers: or otherwise / the Lord saw cowldnes and backwardnes in
religion / by nuszlinge to depely in the world / whereby at length to borrow of
three and scarce to pay one. Saying then that God so sharply corrects such
professors as by toils and cares retire from there religiouse affections: yt
is good to pray for a contented mind / to norrishe your first love and zeal
to God by all due means / and not to suffer the world / and desire of
equality with others to quench the same: and to beware of puttinge on the gay
cloak of religion / for any other cause then for religion yt self / which rightly
possessed makes the differens between brute beasts and men or / rather between
devils and saints. And to invite preachers to your table / more to learn of
theme and to be reproved by theme / need so requiringe then to get any fame or
glory thereby. And forasmoche as merchants can hardly keep theme selves from
wrong (spun sticking so fast to that trade as nail in the wall) they must
both pray the more earnestly / and say with Job / I did fear all my worcks:
and not to forgett that you be subject to change and casualties: and next to be
thankful for your daily gettings / lest otherwise in a time unlooked for / you
cry with the rytch merchants of babylon: alas alas for in one hour so great
riches is come to desolation. The anabaptists do well in commendinge manuell
trades / and we confess it worthy of commendacion / because yt is furthest of
from defylinge pitche: but they fowlie err in denyenge merchandise to be Gods
ordinans / saying buyenge and sellinge is one of the legs / whereupon every
common welthe does stand / for the better help of Prince / nobles and country
/ otherwise Abraham / Jacob and the rest would not buy there lauds to bury in /
nor the sale of land in booze his time. Only the Lord requires equity / right
dealinge and else what / which is more commonly known / then practysed.

The third sort be retaylers in the upper shopps: In which place as there be
honest men and ancient matrons that occupy substantial and profitable wares
/ to the beneficte of the buyers: Retaylers.
so is yt otherwise of the rest reported. But because men love better gentle
admonitions / then bitter vmbradings: therefore I wyshe both young men and
reputed virgins there to wynn credit to the hows and to theme selves / by
desert of better fame then is abroad / and to be no less honest and chaste young
men / sober damselles and virgins in deed and in proof / then they are in face
and show / for to stopp the mowthes of such ill reporters: eschewinge levitie
and wantonness / with the pride of heart / gate / and apparel / and not to sit
ydlie and gasinge about / but either havinge leisure to be profitablie readinge
/ or as the Apostle sayethe to labor and worck sum good thing with there hands
for there own behoufe and others. By which yt apperethe that the holy Ghost
allowethe not the making and sellinge of badd and deceytefull things / nedeles
toys for the increase of greater pride / lest God be offended. To conclude God
keye you from the contempt of this short and freyndly admonition / and grant
you his holy fear / the love of true Godlynes / and the hatred of all
wyckednes / with careful watch for the sovereign Judge so hastily coming
to Judge both quich and dead.

Fourthly the french and dutche merchants walkinge in that Royal place.
Strangers.
Most of you be in the church / and I hope of the church / though sum times
the wolf be wthin the fowld / when the sheep is wthout. Many of your company
my self does know to be of as good disposition / as of a sownd profession /
repayringe first to our country from the rage of the enemy for the zeal you
bare to Gods religion. Wherefore as your churches be entitled reformed / so
(according as you be gravely instructed) indever much to refourme your lyves
and manners / your deeds and actions / both husbands and wyves / after the
doctrine and order of a reformed church / whereby to draw credit and more
revere^t estimation to those large assemblies for / the honor of the gospel /
and to avoyde the gevinge of offens to the sla^der of the same / and the
dscredit of the churches in London and else where: otherwise the^ this careful
watch / look for nothing but a more heavy judgment to light on your heads /
then on theme that want the good mean you have. And as for such strangers as
be wthout the zeal of Gods honor and the care to lyve vertuousely / such as
be insatiable rakers of rytches / hynderers of the poor / and servers of there
belly more then of God / the Lord purge the church of such Hypocrites if any
of those be amongst you. And the others that have as little union or communion
with you / but be either papists / anabaptists or open atheists God change theme
from city and country. Wyshinge both prentices / and other youths of the
City bearinge grudge and ill will to religiouse strangers to purge there
hearts of all former malys and to favor theme whom both God and Prince does
expressly so command: as Levit 19. If A stranger dwell with you in your land
you shall not vex him / but he shall be as one of your souls / and thou shall
lobe hyn as thy self.

Fyfthlie sum new Saduces and libertynes / now and then do trepe and walk in
the midst of you: Sadduceans.
as Job says / that satan commes a monge Gods children. The which dead soul
parsons under vital life / proclaymes warninge for all that would lyve with
Christ Jesus to avoyde there fearful estate and dambnable opinions / no less
then our bodies do shunn the poison of spiders. And saying the Lord has
given over such vnbelevers of the general resurrection to the power of satan
/ exceptinge the said vital life reserved longer for a fuller measure of
there extreme iniquity / whereby to be chayned in there hellyshe inheritans: I
wish and exhort every worshipper of God possessinge the hope of our joyful
rysinge again / both to pray and to read much for to be rooted in a present
and lyvely felinge of a greater confidens of that gladsome resurrection: both
to mitigate all worldly greyfes / and the better to seal Gods eternal
election wthin there hearts. And no less to beware of there copartners and
staggeringe disciples / neither wholly with theme nor flattly against theme /
but waveringe between both / because the ladder of there rude reason / is not
long enough to reach to such an high mystery: like the anabaptists
denienge the humanity of Christ to come from his mother / because there
shallow reason can not reach how then he cowld be wthout synn. Therefore as the
one reiectethe the true Christ / professinge another with his flesh from else
where: so our new Saduces blott out from there hearts all manner of thought of
that most terrible and joyful day of the Lord: studienge for no more then to
eat drynck and be merry / until to morrow they dye as the brute ox / though
not so well. To the which myschefe they are come by voluptuouse security / with
the neglect or contempt of Gods word / and so be ensnared with darch and deadly
dowtes in this light of the gospel. These staggerers with there grand Captains
do call Gods provide^s and his regiment over all into question / as well as the
rysinge of our bodies: as thus / how can there be an outstretched providens
from God above to us here beneathe / saying there is such confusions and
distractions in the world / so manyfould hurly burlies / and unspeakable
injuries by one man to another wthout redress: the worce disposed doing all
outrage / in A florishinge and pleasant estate: and such as be esteemed Godly /
to be most miserable / oppressed / vexed and set naught by: all which should not
be if there were any such provide^s. For brevitie sake I must silence the
answer: who might as well say / how cowld there be of God / and his providens
in former times saying not only Abel and John the Baptist Gods special
servants were so sharply rewarded for there holiness and righteousenes / but the
Prophetts Apostles and Christ him self. All this were as much as if the
presidents and so many thousand martyrs were starck fools to suffer such
torments and tortures / vnlest they had parfect knowledge of Gods providens with
a right felinge and hope of the last resurrection: wthout which / the vildest men
in the world were in the liberty of the flesh in far better state then we.
These new Saduces with there staggeringe disciples / seek to comprehe^d by there
pudled reason / that which is inco^prehencible to humayne wisdom: and do marvel
how the bodies so long time putrified in the grownd / mangled by swerds and
weapons / burnt to ashes / torn and eaten of wild beasts and devowred of sea
fisches / how and after what manner all these should rise by again / with the
same bodies and bodily members. Who he like the vnbelevinge Corynthes termed
fools by the Apostle and therefore disputed with only by the similitude of corn
and natural reason. These quaking questioners / labor to throw down faith
beneathe reason: and to attain by reason / that which is proper to the office of
faith. To whom so ever the which faith is not geven under so long time of the
gospel yt is no marvel they dowte and stagger / and become rather curiouse
inquisiters / then Godly learners: and so might demand how the lord cowld
make Adam of claye / and Eve of his ribb: or how they three parsons ca^n be one
God / and one to be three? so daringe to meddle with the mystery of all
mysteries / like the Anabaptists / no less quisitive in effect / to wete how
cowld the Devinitie of Christ assume his flesh of hers that was so stained by
original gilt. Let the Royal Exchange / City and country beware of these
perilouse people / avoydinge there dowtes and devillishe questions: exhortinge
there with that they be frequent hearers and readers of Gods holy word / for
to be daily strengthened in there faith and hope with better regard to the
articles of the Christian faith: especially two of theme so much oppugned by
multiplienge adversaries both here and there: namely the anabaptists English
and dutche / denyeng the two natures of Christ in one gloriouse parso^ / with 6.
more horrible opinions: and the said dowters of the resurrection. Now let all
right belebers in the true Christ from Mopses / the Psalms and de Prophetts /
rejoice and be of good comforth under what cross or distress soever: For assure
as he has taken our flesh / sanctifienge and glorifiengc yt: so surely shall
we be glorified with him / seing^he our head the first fructs of theme that
slept is risen again / assended with our substans the sede of David and has
dignifyed yt on the right hand of his father / as he took yt and sanctified yt
here beneathe. As certainly shall we his members flesh and boane of his rise
again to be partakers of his Joys as we have been partakers of his blessings
here and suffrnigs. That if the husbandman hops the corn sown by his hand
under clodds and stones shall rise again / new / fresh / and with great in
crease: much more ought we to hope that our bodies shall rise again by Gods
omnipote^cie as sede sown with his own hand whether in the grave in the fire /
in these a / or in the feilde renewed and clarified with unspeakable
increasings / and that with no more difficulty then when he made the whole
frame of this world without substans or matter by his very word. St. Paul
would us to remember / that as the corn must first be sown and dye in the
yerthe before yt receyve a new body / a grene blade and ripe ear: so must we
be the lords sedenes before the happy harvest / namely / sown / dead /
buried / and rotten / before we have a gloriouse and Immortal body / even the
same in substants / though in quality yt shall be changed / and then to be
caulled spiritual bodies / differinge in such sort from that they were
before / as the celestial bodies / the son moon and stars do differ one
from another in glory. At which time our hearts / eyes and ears shall feel se
and hear such a marveylouse thang of the use they were here / as neither
toungs nor all the pens in the world are able to Express. And therefore happy
be the penitents for there sins / the studiers for Godliness / and the lovers
of God: and blessed are they that in faith do meditate / and in hope do
rejoice sum times on this Joyful day. Concludinge then that as there is two
deaths the first and second / in yerth and in hell: so there us a first and
second resurrection / that is from sin and from the grave / the partakinge of
the one / is the confirmation of the other: And when our souls do invisiblie
go from the bodies: then that spiritual and Immortal part goethe unto the
heaven of heavens and not down to the grave to sleep there with the corpse
until the resurrection / as our anabaptists of Harlem / and the rest do
miserably howld with the purtenances.

Sixthly the worshipful Gentlemen of all quarters of the land are by occasion
sum times wthin that pleasant Edifice with whom I must be breyffer then I
thought to have been. Gentlemen.
Presuminge likewise that they in courtesy will esteem of this poor pamphlett
/ though wthout fynenes of method / or pullishe of art. You then of the
better sort termed gentle / as gentlemen deryved from gentle condisions:
remember I pray you that as by the word of health you once felt / and I trust
do yet feel / spiritual motions the very inward caullinge from the Lord to
the love and zeal of his truth: so to geve all diligens that you be no
changelings / but dutifully the same / what cownterbuffs so ever do come in
your way to the contrary. Affectinge the good and dislikinge the evell. And
let your fortitude be in sylens and hope / with prayer and paciens: though sum
paradventure on each side of your habitacions do either hault / or be key
could or gonn back from that they were with you / or as stars faullen / there
light under a bushel / other sum choked with the world / and sum of a looser
life then ever you looked for: yet as Helias continued the servant of God
though he saw none to be left with him but all gonn: and Job the worthy servant
of God in so evil a time wherein much ungodliness was in the world / yet stood
he fast in his good life / though he saw few so affected / to gether with
righteouse Lot nothing returned from his holy conversation notwthstanding the
multitude of wicked Sodomites on every side: but the one and the other proceeded
and parsisted in there piety: In like sort stand you fast / quite you like
men / proceed as spiritual soldiers / and so to finishe as true Christians /
and then the garland to come is yours / with the present peace of conscience /
which in this life us the cheyfe reward of true Godlynes. The other part of
gentlemen so naked of the weddinge garment / as they be void of oil in there
lamps / lovinge better to follow the cry of there hownds / then either to
hear the voice of the preacher / or to imitate your Godly example: I wyshe us
all to pity and pray for theme / that make so small accowmpt of religion and
good life / otherwise then of there belly God and lady pleasure: who thereby /
as they seem to be flatt Atheysts and therefore in most woeful case: so the
papisticall gentlemen (as fauls hearted to gospel and Prince as they be
addicted to romish Idols) be as unfit for civil office and authority / as
by want of faith they are yet for the Kingdom of glory: whereunto the Lord
frame and convert theme / in the time of his yourpose and pleasure. But you
good gentlemen must think on the dignity of your profession / of the servant
knowing much to do his masters will / on the brevitie of your days / of the
best exercises to be had therein / and in time of your recreations to glorify
God / and to beware of prophanations / taking great delight in your graciouse
God / not alone for your welthe health / leisure and liberty / but cheyfly for
his illumininge spirit / the fear of the Lord / and for that by grace you
discearne your selves to stand the contreyes in stead / and your good examples
to be as glasses for theme to look in. Then may that circuit be cownted happy
conteyninge so virtuous an examplar / as the congregation most blessed to have
before theme a Godly and learned teacher. Therefore for the better approbatio^
of your state and degrees / to be a warrantable caullings from God (so
myghtelie denied of sum) first as you are curteouse and gentle up the guide of
your names / so in other things to be fownde wthin rule and good order: often
wthin the lords hows / as a sure record you be of the same / lyvinge stones
and helpinge members lovers of the Prince / proctors for her good causes / but
more specially for Gods / and that in good sort with whom you must lyve beyond
the time of all Princes: helpinge gentlemen / but not hurtinge neyghbors of the
poor in the co^treys. Likewise you worshipful of ^yne acquayntans both
discrete and of good carriage of your selves / I pray you prefer the holiness
of religion by being found truly religiouse / that so your fellow gentlemen
may be ashamed to speak evil of your good profession / when they shall se you
hate vice / love virtue / releyve the poor / to bring up your family in the
knowledge and reverens of God / as I have known you to have donn sum in the
city and more in the country: of which number there be to few / and theme over
basely esteemed though of great price before the Lord and his people redeemed.
In the mean time my worshipful freynds I humbly crave the help of your
prayers in this far distans occasioned partly by sum doctorly frowns partly
by my daughters letters and by great boasts to se such en English church
here as nompareille and so yt is par derrriere and finally through rash trust
in sum not so trusty / whereby the oulde man was hither transported / to be of
his God justly and gently corrected.

And further to premonishe both you and the worshipful in the exchange: I
wijshe you beware of the dangerouse opinions of such English Anabaptists bred
here / as whose parsons in part with more store of there letters does creps and
spread amongst you in city and country. The which perilouse herysies wherewth
they be so lately infected / did not only proceed of obstinacy in error / but
of pride and singularity / with the want of love and humility to keep unity
and peace among theme selves when they came over. And as by my private letters
I have forewarned sum particular frepuds: so by this simple and forrayne labor
/ I intended a more general: since I heard that one of this company in
Norwich intends to endure shortly an execution against him. By which
premonishement I would gladly make you more careful and watchefull to prevent
the invisible sower of darnell a monge the good wheat. And so no leff to seek
the right armure of prouffe and shilde of defens for our devine causes / whereby
to foil theme that intend to defyle others then they seek fauls armure by
wrest of scripture / with wyle weapons to make unlawful resistans against the
most holy and ancient faith of the universal church / the which not to
manteyne and defend in sum measure by the O Christian / reader and every true
member of the same / were such and threason to the Catholyke faith / and to
her object Jesus Christ / as the Turcks / Jews / and Papists should be far
better then theye bp reason in there blind zeal they study and labor all
they can to support there fauls religions / and to gaynesay the contrary. And
dare thou of what condision so ever tushe and make light of this as though
yt appartayned not to the? God forbid.

Gentlemen warned of the opinions of the Anabaptists.
First our English and Outche here howld that Christ took not his pure flesh
of the Virgin Mary: and do deny her to be his natural mother. Secondly that
the Godheade was subject to passions and to death which is Impassible. Thyrdly
that the infants of the faithful ought not to be baptized. Fourthly that the
souls do sleep in grave with the bodies until the resurrection. Fyfthly that
Maicstrates ought not to put malefactors to death. Sixthly they condemn all
wars and Subjects in armure in the feyld. Seventhly they denyt the article of
predestination: they deny the L. day. And finally they savor much of the
opinions of fre will / and the merit of works. You se now how needful yt is
for men to be armed / and to be strong in the faith / so wastinge and wthstode
in these latter days / to be more otenpied in prayer and scripture then of
custom / saying Satan now whettens his horns by Gods parmission to goore the
more dyrefully for our further exercise and trial. And in charity foresee as
you may / that such smothe parsons and papers do not infect the poor simple
so unable to wthstand there subtle and and painted reasons. For once stained
therewth they shall as hardly be delyvered / as the entangled byrd from the
lyme bushe / because yt is as a rustie cancker eatinge throw wthout recoverie /
by either gentle ople or the hard stele / no nor by the flaminge fire / no more
then there grand mother Ione Butcher could thereby be reclaymed. And therefore
yt is wyshed that neither tortures nor violence to be used (if authority so
please) to there bodies / otherwise then bannishement out of those contreyes /
by reason our noble Prince / Judges / nor state should not be so reputed of with
such hard terms of Anabaptists and others as I on loath here to express and
allreadie greved to hear what I deareby occasion of report that one of this
Englysh company is shortly like to die / being presoner at Norwych. Besides
that there pertinacie and desperate resolution to suffer for there bad causes
will entice the ignorant / not only to thinck that there outtagiouse zoyle is a
sanctified zeal / proper only to the true martyrs but likewise to dowte the
more of the Christian faith / and so make there diabolical bowldnes to appear
an holy suffringe and right martyrdom / where yt is rather a strong delusion
of Satan who mightily begyleth thereby: for as Christ in these xvj. hundred
peers space has had most holy and constant martyrs in his church: so the
devil as an ape imitatinge every good thing in the said church / has
likewise many fauls and rash headed sufferers in his malignant church in all
ages and now is evident by the bowld Iesuttes / chusinge rather stubbernlie to
die in the defens of there abominations / then to lyve in the Catholyke faith
/ by cravinge pardon of the Prince for there tried threasons. Baulls priests
suffered much in there devillishe zeal to there fauls Gods when they so
lawnced skorched there flesh to the bones with there kuyves. Did not King
Manasses in a wicked zeal / cause his sons to pass throw the fire. Besides
the hardynes of the Iacobins that slew the late. French king / and that
desperate murderer committinge the like to the Prince of Orrenge / who though
his flesh by gobbets was nipt of with burning pyncheons / yet that greved him
not when he was could the Prince was dispatched. The same subtle spirit that
wrought then will no dowre worck the like giddines and self blodshed in the
Anabaptists. But true martyrdom is a witnessinge by voice and death for the
defens of the three gloriouse parsons in one God / and for the mayntenans of
Christ his debinitie and Immanitie in one parson / and for his gloriouse
gospel sake. I esteem such kind of sufferers no better then they that be
aucthors of there own death. St. Peter sayethe / if any man suffir let him
suffer as a Christian and not as an evil doer. I wysh such to thinck on
Hackett his frantyke zeal lately executed in cheapsyde: since whose vilde
death many a good Christian have been no less vmbraded and reproched / then
the sacred discipline mocked and despised. To conclude let us confess the
gospel entierlie in yt fullnes / and to the death stand to / that Christ
has the substans of God and the substans of man / of him self from above /
and of David here beneathe / yet spottless of our gilte. And therefore let us
solace our selves with these words in the tenn of the Hebr. Saying therefore
brethern that by the blodd of Jesus / we may be bowld to enter into the holy
place by the new and lyvinge way which he has prepared for us throw the veil
that is his flesh. Wherein we se that the flesh of Christ does show us his
devinitie as hidden under a veil / which otherwise we could not endure to
behowld that splendour and glory / by the which veil we are directed and ledd
unto God / as he says in John xij. He that seythe me / seythe him that sent
me: Wherefore / o heavy and faithful heart under the burden of synn: chere up
thy self: for asmoche as our heavenly father does graciousely and frelie
Impute Christ his righteousenes unto us for to geve us life eternal / in that
he behowldeth us not in our selves / but in his son: as contrary wise he
strykinge him our redemer for us / and behouldinge us in him / did exempt us
from hell and condembnation. The which imputation of righteousenes commes not to
us by any mixture of his unspotted humanity with ours so spotted / but by the
virtue of his spirit / he is in such sort united so nere unto those that
apprehend him by faith / as he and they be one body / spirituallie Joined:
for the substants of body and soul have nothing commune with this spiritual
marriage / but rather we are made his under the virtue of this vnton by fre
Imputacion: as likewise by Imputacion he and all his threasures are ours / which
is confirmed to the faythefull lovinge and fearinge God in the supper: eat
co^pfortablie of this meat / as also by readinge / marckinge and applieng. And
seek out these texts to strengthen thy self and others: namely how Christ is
caulled the sone of God and the son of man: to have a father in heaven and a
mother in yerthe. A child and a son to be borne and geven us. The word was God
/ and was made flesh. Termed the Sede of David / and the son of David.
Christ descended from the fathers after the flesh. He was in the form of God
/ and in the form of a servant. And in sundry places caulled the son of Mary
/ David his lord no less then David's son: a woman compassed a man. Christ as
a man did eat / drinck / sleep / was weary / and verily died. And he both God
and man / walked on the sea / and caused the dead to come out of the grave /
he is Alpha and Omega: the rote of David / and the generation of David / which is
plain two natures God and man. May I not say now with the Apostle? O ye folishe
and fond conceyted Anabaptists / who has bewitched you? To deny this cheyfe
article the sowndation of our Christian faith and the end of our salvation.
God mollify your hard hearts / and make us heartily thanckfull for his truth
to us revealed being our sovereign happiness / if yt be preciouselie esteemed /
and not slenderly regarded / or cowldly professed. It behooves the Godly both
in the Exchange / city and country to read and to make more estimation of
reading of the scripture and the devine conseque^ces from the same. that as you
take times there / for buyenge and sellinge / walkinge and communing / so in
Gods behaulf and your own / to observe the times of reading / prayenge /
hearing and of praysinge the Lord / consideringe the Apostle says / geve
attendans to readinge / as well as to exhortation and doctrine. And note that
fructeless reading of vain books from profane aucthors is as hurtful / as
necgligent hearing of the word is unprofitable. The right use of which two
virtues is to be traved of God: the one publykely by the office of the ear /
and the other private by use of the eye and tongue: and both to be nothing
wthout the will mind and affection: Better therefore is a short and diligent
readinge now and then with good attencion / then to turn many leaves with small
regard and less apprehe^tion. The holy Ghosts in mercy open our ears /
dispose our hearts and guide our tongs to these ends for Gods glory and our
mutual compforth / Amen. To the which gloriouse parson we must often in these
kinds make special suit unto: for as his graciouse presens in hearing and
readinge does keye from us wrong interpretacion / werynes and tediousenes: so
his absens is cause of the one and the other / with our disprofict and great
anoye. At such times then let us cry / come holy Ghost / enleghten and
support our ignorans and weakness: not that God the thryd parson coeternall with
the father and the son can be comprehended in any man / who is so
incomprehencible of him self / but rather we desire his effects / operation and
working: as we se the manyfould beams procedinge from the body of the son so
far distant from the earth / does yet send down her heat and power to all
the treatures. And as I wyshe you profitablie to read and hear: so in
walkinge in either Exchange / feyld or hows to remember to walk out your race
and the rest of your days more carefully and religiousely to the Kingdom of
heaven ward: for the commandment of God to our father Abraham that he should
walk holilie before him / does also appartayne to you his children by faith
that hope to be with him in glory: and so to practys Hezychia his sacred prayer
/ saying / I beseech the o Lord remember how I have walked before the in
truth and with a parfect heart. A prayer and lesson worthy to be thought on
saying the Lord no less requires this of us then of the Isralitishe church:
saying what does the Lord thy God require of the / but to fear the Lord
thy God / to love and serve him to walk in his ways / and to cleave unto him /
as though wthout which stickinge and cleavinge / he is no nerer God to us then
to his universal creatures. Wherefore as the Apostle says / if we lyve of the
spirit / let us walk in the spirit. And to walk in this sort is to walk
acceptablie and securely. My self in great weakness walkinge sum times in
that worshipful hows: although I made there the best choice I could of
parsons and taulk for our mutual good: yet my heart tongue and ear slippinge so
often besides the due byas with the loss of time wherein to have been better
occupied / makes me now to crave pardon of God / and thus publykely to confess
yt a fault unto the world. And therefore good brethren of such loving
acquayntans: as I am hartelie thankful for your courtesy and gentleness: so do
I wish that you occupy or spare that populouse place / none otherwise but as
caullinge and necessity requirethe.

The Apostle exhorts all to apply our selves to the time: the brevitie
whereof considered / yt will hasten us to Employ the best exercises therein.
Time.
For as nothing is more preciouse then the time: so of many nothing is more
vyldlie abused / and every thing more certain then the continuans thereof. It
lacks but a little of xvi. hundred years a go / since St. Paull said / the
time is but short: then yt must needs be so much the more short now by so
many years / where upon as all Godly changers will be the more quickened and
awakened to Exchange there unprofitable use of the time to a better: evenso / I
exhort all misspenders / abusers and voluntary necglecters of the time in
that royal Exchange / so to change or cast away that great fault in theme /
as there right usage of the time from this readinge forwards may be a
testimony of there true faith and repentans: for time is so preciouse that yt
must be redeemed and stryven for. And thus Christian reader I wyshe you to
esteem much and to devyde the time for several exercises therein / both for
God / and for your selves / for Prince city and family. No dowte the devil
persuades sum carnal and viciouse parsons that there time is well spent /
being usual in the tavern and that there Impiety is closely covered when
they do babble out a few cowld prayers / and come once a weke to the church
wthout regard of other duties. As a daplie dronckard in Billeter lane /
answered one requiringe his hasty rysinge the next day: I must said he have
a time to put on my clothes / a time to pray / and a time to set mine how
should in order. By whom we se that as all heritikes thinck theme selves to
have the best religion and to be nerest unto God: so common dronckards and
carnal lyvers / by sum show of civilitie esteem theme selves as honest and as
truly religiouse as the best / and both by a subtle prompt of the divill. Who
has fair painted hypocrites in the church in the alchows / and tavern
dronkards / besides adulterers / blasphemers and robbers / all these will make
show of religion / and seem to love the church and sermon: but none otherwise
then as sum gay professors (kepinge secret minions) do love there wives / more
for fame and to a void shame / then for any right affection they bear to the
one or the other. These miserable people will also come bowldly to the Exchange
/ and be no more a shamed to be there / then a frayed in the church at the
hearing of Gods judgments denownced against theme: because for the time /
they have no less adamant hearts wthout felinge / then brazen forheads wthout
blusshinge. Nevertheless being in the compass of this freyndly exhortation: I
beseech you / as brethren by creation / although not yet by regeneration to
take sorrow and greyf to heart / with syedie and unfeigned repentans: that so you
may be changed both in church hows / and in the Exchange from that you have
been to that you should be / tremblinge at Gods judgments / and so hartylie to
crave mercy and grace. Estemynge now a most dangerouse thing to think on to
morrow / and to neglect this days conversion. Wyshing you to forgeit no longer
what is written: except you be borne again you cannot enter into the Kingdom
of God. For if you beleyue in Christ crucified / then must you be in better
forte crucified with him / that is to slay and mortify those enormities /
whervy to have the similitude of his death by kyllinge such gross sins /
and also the similitude of his resurrection by rysinge again in to the newnes
of life. The which the Lord grant for his mercy sake. Generally then all do stand
in need to beg and entreat that the fear of the Lord be graven and grownded
wthin our hearts: the which as yt is the spiritual bytt to curb us back from
such execrations: so is yt a devyne spurr to quicken us forwards to all
Christian actions. The which being absent / is surely the death of all virtue /
the increase of all vice / the shipwreck of conscyens / and all confusion in
life. Therefore blessed is the man to whom the fear of the Lord is granted /
because yt is glory gladness / reioysinge and the Joyful crown / as Sirack
says / and that as well of the ritche and noble as of the mean and poor.
Understand not here such a fear as the bondsman is of a tyrant / or a
condemned theyfe of the Judge / but as of a graciouse child / in fear and
love to obey / that is in being loathe to offend our good father and lasting
lover / and also in fear of his rodd. So myxinge hope and fear to gethers as
to feel an humble reuerens in our hearts / to the God of correction and of
merry / being Joyful and thanckfull when by grace we cease to do evyll / and
to do the good / and sorry and fearful / yea pemtent and tearefull when by
weakness we be drawn to the contrary. And as every Christian ought to crave
and covet this singular virtue: so to lament to se such turpitudes and
myscheyfs about us in the world / throw the want of this fear. Let us then
fear and serve the Lord with all our hearts / as many as intend to be partakers
of his glory: I speak to theme unto whom God has geven right ears to hear.

Again sum times the proud and lofty do walk there to be seen in there
beyght and braverie / as well as others of good degree both men and women spend
an hour there for necessity of recreation. Proud.
And therefore they walkinge and wearinge in that common place agreeable to there
caullinge and state / are not to be adjudged among such proud and lofty so
over stately lokinge. Wyshinge all infected parsons with that great and
capital synn changinge angels into devils hastily to discern that infection
/ wherbie in time to seek and find the remedy / and to esteem there hawtie
heart as a certame dronckennes / be witchinge or dullinge the same / so as
neither precept from God / nor duty to man is regarded: and yt proceeds from
the aucthor of pride / and by a fauls imagination of theme selves: the
possessors whereof can neither pray rightly to God / nor effectually hear the
word / nor lyve quietly and familierly with there neighbors / much less to
guide there hearts and tounges charitablie and orderly. God grant you then to
hate and abhor pride and to laugh yt to skorn / saying there is nothing more
against true Godlynes and your salvation then the same / by reason yt besotteth
men and women / thrustinge theme to rashenes / unruliness / and to take
overmoche head and bridle. And here let the best regenerat keep in mind /
that this pride will incrediblie lurck and be hydd in theme to there hurt /
wthout good head and watch / for that yt is hard to be known in all things
and at all times. I for bear to speak much of this subtle sin: but only
towch such dreggs and remnants thereof as remain in Gods children to keep
theme in battle / to strive and wrestle against yt / being to theme such a
stinge as yt prycketh and pyncheth / wowndeth and heals (where the said
health by grace must consequently follow) like fire expellinge fire / or one
synn healing another / as poison geves remedy to poison. Wherefore the better
to know sum subtlety of that lurcking syun even in the Godly / whosoever is so
styffly opiniated as to stand in there own conceit / or loathe to be justly
and freindly reproved for there fault / or trusts more in there own ways /
then ruled vy advice and cowncell / or that glory excessively for there well
doing / or that contend more for victory in disputacion or resoninge / then
to yield to the plain truth: they undoubtedly are stained with this pride and
had need with the aucthor to pray for a contrite / humble and lowly heart. We
shall never hate and shunn pride / love and imbrase humility to practis yt /
before men narrowly visit and ransike there own hearts: whereby the better to
know theme selves. At which time behowldinge the storehows and heap of synn
wthin us / we shall the sooner stowpe and abase our gap plumes / and check down
the proud heart so previlie sckinge to mownt a lofte / and cry o dust and
ashes cum back stay thy self / and clymbe no higher: by which consideration we
will at length confess / that as pride is the Capital and head vice in
wicked men: so humility is the chifest virtue in the Godly / wthout which
fowndation all other virtues be blown a way with the blast of vayneglorie / as
dust or feathers with the wind of the air. But as for the gross and common
proud (who as Job says look up to the son) so proud as the pecock and as
stowt as the lion / exaltinge your selves and castinge down others / the
Prophet Esaye cries against you / saying the day of the Lord shall be on such
as be lyfted up in there hearts / upon the high Cedars of Liban / and on the
great oaks of Basan. Down therefore / and be thinck that as waters stand not
on high mownt aynes / but sekes down to the low valleys: so the graces of
Gods spirit abides not in the lofty heart / but goes into the humble and
lowly. The which God in merry grant to the writer and reader / to teachers and
learners.

The poor though they be neither walkers nor dealers amongst you / yet they
pass to and fro through the Exchange / both the Godly poor / and profane
poor / the one under Gods blessing and favor / the other under his frown and
displeasure / who though they be rude and lewd / and as void of disposition
to learn / as of common knowledge amongst men: Poor.
yet as the creatures of God / they are not alone to be corrected and forced to
labor / but to be pitied releved and helped / especially the syck lame and
aged among that sort: assuringe your selves that we are none otherwise the
children of God / then by doing good to such as be unworthy thereof by Gods
own example causinge the son and rain to show there needful efferts upon
both just and unjust. For where the Apostle byndeth a special good to be donn
to the nedie in Gods hows / he excludes not but commands the like to those
miserable people notwthstandinge they with others seem to begin there hell
here / until the Lord towche there hearts with repe^tans and conversion: yet in
the mean time we are to show theme pity and compassion. Most worthy
examples of this dutiful regard to all sorts of poor I se in this town of
Harlem / even multitudes provided for every Lords day / besides hospitalls for
men women and children with sick howses for the diseased / never none seen to
dye in the street or starve under stall. The other kind of poor be in and of
the church / our brethren and susters / as well by the second as the syrst
birth / gevinge your selves to prayer to labor and travel as you may for your
mayntenans / and are ashamed to be seen beggynge or cravinge in street or
door: there up your selves / howld out and parsist to the end with paciens
under Gods cross / wthout either envyenge the ritche or grudgiuge against the
Lord / consideringe Jesus Christ has sanctified the poverty of his poor /
in that for there sake he became poor him self. But se that you feel the
inward poverty of the spirit / to be joined with the outward / whereby to have
the blessinge pronownced in the gospel Blessed are the poor in spirit. The
which noble virtue ought to be desirable to Lords ladies / and the greatest
Threasurers in the world. That if by grace thou haste the rytches of the soul
be never ashamed nor greved / but rather humbled at the poverty of thy body.
For thy head and Captain was poor in his birth / in his life and death / and
previe to thie base estate because he in wisdom ordained yt so: saying by his
servant St. John / I know thy tribulation paciens and poverty. And you
worshipful ritche / yt is rather Christian honor then any dishonor to your
degrees for to have now and then such Godly poor at your tables to be made
partakers of Gods creatures with you / as havinge sum interest in theme / and so
to distinguish between the Lords special poor and the profane poor / and
both to be succored for his sake.

Sum Printers and stacioners at certain times have there meting there / and
therefore are wthin the compass of this freyndly gretinge. Prynters.
First I acknowledge the Art to be most profitable / excellent / and
necessary for church and common welthe / and God highly to be praised for
revealinge that synguler knowledge unto me^ / and also to be prayed unto for
less abuse and more right use of the same / by Printinge and fellinge such
good books grownded on scripture as in crease knowledge / virtue and the fear
of God / no less then for the mayntenans of laws and civil order. But as the
great number of Printers have compiled more books then men have brains to
conceive / memories to retain / or money to buy: so the multitude of there
worcks over dulleth and burdeneth / and is a great stopp to the best and
fittist readings. And therefore for the better vttera^s of so many idle books
in shopps and stalls / me thincks (in good policy) the wise and worshipful
sort of that compame might do well to procure a stay and sum rest to be had
for there over werped presses / but especially for men's weak memories. For
many unhappy wytts practys to follow good writers / and to the great hurt
of the church do make huge heaps or cartlodes of fond and folyshe books /
from the which fault I esteem the Godly Printer to be free / and therefore he him
self is to be well esteemed of as his good travel and labor to be commended.
But such of that caullinge in my natyve country as have neither care nor
conscie^s to print and publishe vain and unprofitable / profane and hurtful
pamphletes to the offens of God and men / fillinge the peoples heads /
emptieng there purses with the abuse of there eyes and ears / by there fables
or skossinge devices / are both to be reproved and restrained. For as God
has his holy and learned servants in cities and contreyes / that study and
pen forth worthy worcks for his glory and to the benefirt of his church:
so the devil / has his seducing secretaries or pennslaves in secret corners
to serve the humors of such had instruments / and the affections of rude
readers. I have known in Powles church yard sum perilouse as well as popish
and supersticiouse books sold previly to the ill disposed by such as I pray
God to give theme true repentans.

Shipmaisters and maryners of good interest in the exchang / you also be
needful members for Prince / people and state / venturinge your ships goods
and lyves by transporting of commodities from sundry contreyes and nations /
behowldinge more plenty of Gods wonderful worcks / his corrections and
deliverances / his help at a pinche to sum / and his sudden and corporal
Justice to others / and therefore the more bownd to dread and fear him as a
Judge and Lord / to obey him as our sovereign master / and to love him as a
favorable father / who returninge you saufe to country / wife / and
acquayntants: Marytiers.
then as Noye escapinge the great flod did buyld an alter and offered to the
Lord: so you to offer hearty thancks / to rejoice and to lyve in good order /
to stand still on your watch and to remember that you must to the Sea again to
abide all tides and weather. For they that serve the Lord / and avoyde riot in
the quiet haven / shall surely be heard and helped in the time of storm. In
all my time on seaboorde (the Lords great schoule house) as I have known
no^bers that were of another disposition: so I trust the time has not changed
you yet lyvinge / as yt has donn sum others changinge like the moon. The Sea
was the first correctinge preacher / for the space of xvj. years / which caulled
me from much folly / and that gave sum entrans to know and fear the Lord:
and therefore amongst so many learned and lyvinge preachers / blessed be his
name for the Sea my dumb and fearful teacher: in which navigable art I spent
the pryme of mine peers when schole had been more firt / if ability had
served: which will not suffer me to forget that which I would you ever to remember
/ namely that God is merveylouse in all his worcks and worthy to be much
thought on / in your Sea storms / swellinge waves / cross tides / dangerouse
races / long travers in contrary wynds / the ship on hull / the heline on lee
/ full hawse in tumbling roades / when shipwreck is fearedwthout fast howld of
cable and aricker / stepeless and fearful nights / four beer and beans
often times in stead of byskett / cowld watches and wett clothes paynefull and
pumpinge leakes / hale bollinge to double the point / a luff from the rock /
rowmer from the sand / steer at an yuch / or miss the haven / a fogg / at the
entrans / storm and bellow on poope / beside mine acquayntans with your sprung
masts / torn sales from the parde and such like quicknings to draw all
maryners nere unto God / or to harden theme further of to the devil / as
scholars either bettered or made worce by correction: for as sum root of
Godlynes draws the Godly to be more Godly / so that begone root not being
norrished as fire with wodd / yt becomes weaker and vanishes at length till
they be sylthie and more fylthie / yea a traitor to all goodness as Judas to his
master. Wherefore lovinge mates and brethren / bethinck that the crown of
glory is set forth unto us neither in the beginning nor in the midst / but
in the end of the race. Satan and flesh cast many blocks in our way not alone
to hinder us from the holy parseverans / after we have runnthe greater part of
the way / but sumtymes to break of suddenly men's good begynnings. Our cheyfe
stryving must be for parseverans / and the same with good courage / for the
crown that we strive and labor for / is worthy of running. The Apostle to
Timoth. says / continue thou in the things which thou haste learned. And the
Hebr. says / that we are made partakers of Christ if we keep sure unto the
end that beginning / wherewth we are vpho wlden. Let us then learn to
complain against the burden of our corruptions / for that they hinder our
marchinge forwards unto goodness. For the pithe and substans of our Christian
race is to persevere in the fructes of repentans and in the effects of our
holy profession. Let us wthall look well on the compass point directinge to the
haven / that so we may steer right and howld on our course thither wards / and
though now and then we make paws against our wills / yet let us not therefore
geve over / but to the helm again and take better head of our sterage /
puttinge on more bonets and to hoyse up the sails / for to break against the
strong and contrary tide.

Now and then valiant Captains and Gentlemen soldiers come thither to take
there pleasure among you / whose valor and venturable servys for Prince and
state / deservethe the favor and good will of all true subjects. Captains and
Soldiers.
For who but they under God (endowed with courrage and Captaynely knowledge) that
must stand between court / city / and country / and the cruel force or
desperate assault of the enemy? who but they do take there lyves in there
hands / and runn on the point of the pykes for the love of our Soverainge and
commons / sustayning the deadly strokes of the bullet / and do thrust in a mydd
the flashinge swerds and pykes? who but they cowld abide such hunger and cold
/ watch and be wett / abide the roringe canons and thundering culverins / with
the downfall of there terrible shotts on there pates and sum times throw there
breasts or bowels / besides the linger of pay sycknes and mortality? These
are the bowlde bullwarcks that fight and fast / when you be quiet and merry at
your diversity of meats and drincks: who must wake and moyle / when you sleep
and walk at pleasure / and gladder of the courfest bread and the runninge
water / then many ritche be thanck full with the finest diet / and best wine or
beer. Wherefore let all states and degrees esteem of serviceable Captains /
Gentlemen soldiers / and there trained inferiors according to there valor
and demeanure under military discipline / and likewise willingly wthout grudge
to yield to such taxations and payments / which must be levied for there
mayntenans to defend all against the proud and bloddie spaniards / intendinge
to make ryvers of English blodd if they might: But I trust the Sea shall first
devowre those ships and cruel company. Now you worthy servitors both on sea
and land / of such resolution to dye under the said combatts and conflicts: I
beseech you set before your eyes / the most honorable causes of your
adventures / whereby to be the more magnaminiouse and constant / and for your
better felinge of inward compforthe at the hour of your quick dispatche: to
were that you fight for the true honor of your most marveylouse and merciful
God / for the glory and mayntenans of the heavenly gospel of his son Christ /
for your Sovereign Lady defendrix under God of the same / and for your native
and noble contreye her Maces dominions. All these famows respects being
graffed in your hearts / with faith and repentans for sins / then may you
valiantly march / under the helmet of salvation / and the armure of prayer /
after dromme / fyfe and trompett that pleasant and warlyke music / and that
with courrage and joy / with sure trust and confidens that the Lord of hosts is
with you and on your side because you fight under the Lords banner / against
Antichrist and his bloddy band. In the mean time / you worthy Captayned /
Leyvetenants and other Gentlemen of servis / se that you magnify God and his
true religion / by being studiouse to be religiouse and Godly in life / wthout
yeldinge to whoredom dronckennes / blasphamie / quarrellinge or such like: and
to restrain those vices asmoche as you may in others. For as the strength of
the soldier consistethe in the wisdom of the Captain / so the right carriage
of souldyers / is much drawn from the good behavior of there Captains and
guydes. And in using of military correction on your poor soldiers / let
clemency and good discreation be joined with Justis / sekinge rather to remove
the causes of there mutterings / then to use severitie up sudden parturbations
/ studieng no less to be favored and loved then to be bread and feared of
your companyes / and finally (for to bring honor and good fame to your Princes
pay / as well as credit to your selves) yield the poor creatures there due
wages to buy theme victuals for there more stowt standinge in her Maiestis
service wthout could quakinge / or compulsion of stealinge through want thereof.

And you that be common soldiers / love your Prince / obey your Captains / be
contented with your wages / avoyde filthinge and robbinge: and consider what
baddnes and lewdnes is laid every where to your charge / so as by your ill
behavior the worthy name of a soldier is both lothed and shunned. For what
vyldnes and wyckednes is not fownd in many of you? being cownted the skumm and
dross of the world / by your fornications chrietie / tearinge of the body of
Christ / your stealing and murderinge to come by your pray. O my country men I
pray you wax weary of these horrible qualities / ere the shot of great or
small ordina^s tear in pieces your wretched carkases to make spedie passage for
your impenite^t souls to be suddenly partakers of hellishe torments. Repent
therefore and learn to know God / in stead you be thought Godless / spare and
save your wages to serve your pinchinge necessities / and not so horribly to
waste your money / to the destruction of body and soul: that so God may be
merciful to you in Christ.

And although wars be the ordinans of God / and therefore is caulled the Lord
of hosts / or the God of batteyls / being one of his plagues due for our
sins: Of Wars.
yet we are to pray heartily to God for our deliverans from war / and to
obtain peace and concord in stead of it: the terror whereof should make us to
groan and to pray with great longinge for the spedie coming of our redemption
/ as well for our seasing to sin / as for the eternal felicity laid up in
store for us. By the which lawful and happy peace / our lands to be tylled /
our feylds and cattle to flourish / our sede for provision to be sown / our
vyneyards planted and then to enjoy the reapinge and merry harvest with the
pleasant vintage: In short all to lyve under orders and laws / in amity and
unity: where contrary wise wars and discentions forrayn or civil is most
hydeouse and fearful / full of wrath blodd and slaughter / the feylds lyenge
covered with dead carcasses / cities and towns sacked and ruyned / corn and
graff trampled and wasted / famine and hunger / cryenge and lamenting on every
side virgyns and wyves horribly ravished / laws and religion nothing set by
/ the slave and the rascal to raynge and to triumph over the civil and
worshipful. All which terrible skourges considered / yt should make all to look
to our lyves / to repent the misuse of the same / to crave pardon / and to say
Da pacem Domine. Seeing now that God does send wars / and famine / sickness and
mortality for our punishements / and that no such afflictions can come into
the city wthout the Lords sendinge. The Anabaptists are outrageouse by there
rash sensures to condemn wars and warrlyke affairs / or the soldiers
obediens to Princes therein / whether offensive or defensive / and that under
collor that we in the gospel should not war as the Isralites did: wherein they
neither respect the providens and ordinans of God in this / nor the great
desert of there sins with ours procuringe the sword. Besides that they do
greatly abuse these words / law and gospel seperatinge theme further a sunder
/ then they ought / forasmoche as the gospel was in the law / and the law in
the gospel / saying the gospel was from Abam. Secondly they deceyve theme
selves in this use of wars by a fauls understandinge of Christ his
reprehencion to Peter drawinge forth his sword / whereupon they conclude that
Maiestrates ought neither to war / nor to punish malefactors with death.
Surely Princes and all Estates are smally behowlde^ to such fauls teachers and
erroniouse people for maynteyninge those dangerouse opinions against
Maiestracie in these spanishe wars / as well as notoriouse herisies against the
articles of the Christian faith: Princes and States spendinge there threasures
and people in the defens of theme and there goods as well as in ours / otherwise
both clamerouse Anabaptists and Papists should no less be swallowed up of the
enemy / then us the professors of Christ his religion. God make theme less
contemptible and more thankful with us for the Lords Leyvetenants upon yerthe.

Now to the spiritual war / wherein we must be all exercised soldiers / if
we look to be partakers of Gods Kingdom / whereof our savior Christ the Lord of
true peace speaks / saying I came not to send peace in to the yerthe but
war: Spiritual war.
in which kind of war he appointed none other weapons then thus / he that takes
not up his cross and follow me is not worthy to be my disciple / ordayninge
the chefest point of this war to consist in suffringe injuries / and not in
doing theme. Well we must become spiritual warriors and fight under Christ
his ensign with the complete armure mentioned by his worthy warrior S. Paul:
saying put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to refist in the
evell day: remember that in baytysme we bownd our selves so to become Christian
soldiers / as continually to fight against such mighty enemis / as never
cease the crafty assaults but ever seek to scale the walls of our poor souls
/ with whom to take peace / is to break the truce and covenant between us and
our heavenly Captain to our utter destruction. Let us not then snarle and
entangle our selves with over much toil and care of the world / that so we may
the more easily please him that has chosen us to be fyghtinge soldiers.
Christian reader note well this / saying by slender footing in the Lords feylde
many on every side / do take such foyles and deadly wownds / as they depart
from there souldierly rank / by necglect of armure and by faynines of fight in
the time of assault: but let us be ready to say with the Apostle / at the
surre^drie of our last gasp: I have fought a good fight / I have finished my
course / kept the faith and then the crown of glory shall be ours.

Musers on Gods provides.
There us another sort walkinge there between the ordinary hours of the
Exchange / who be great musers on Gods longs suffringe / and on his high
providens by weakness of faith and knowledge / being racked and troubled to be
howld sum egregious wicked men to have the fairest show and greatest florishe /
and therefore do marvel on Gods long suffringe. At with common block many
weakelings do stumble / when they se the Lord one while to delay his
punishements / another while hastily to execute the same / and next in that he
putts of the fuccouringe of his church / or sum distressed member thereof: not
consideringe the words in Tim. 5. sum men's sins are open before hand / and go
before unto judgment / and sum sins follow after. We must bear with that which
the Lord thinks not good by and by to correct / nor to geve the remedy or
succor when we lift / but when he him self will. Again sum men's enormities are
discouvered and come unto judgment sooner then men looked for: and others be
revealed and punished alonge time after / as though yt slept. But albeit Gods
gentle chasticements or heavy judgments do not hasten theme selves / yet they
come on / though sayre and softly after. Simon the sorcerer his sins came
before hand / while Saul / Judas and other hypocrites there finnes came after
/ and were detected at length / though for a time they deceyved many / evenso
Godlynes holiness and virtue have there times limited of commendation and fame /
and although it be long first by reason of sum cloud obscuringe theme for the
time / yet in coming they come and bring the greater joy / therefore
standfast and faint not. And further to answer fuche weak parsons so ready to
stumble at this point: the 13. of Esaye speakethe of the destruction of the
Babylonpans / as though it were presently to be donn when in deed yt fell out
more then 200. years after: saying the day of the Lord is at hand / meaning
the time of the Babylonicall extermination vy Eprus so long time ere it came:
the which scripturely phrases of present speches / for things to come is to be
understand / first that the events and decrees of the Lord do not pass beyond
the time of him prefixed and limited / but shall as certainly come to pass as
of they were already. For that which was don from Adam almost 5600. years a go /
and that which shall be from hence to the worlds end yt is present before God /
because S. Peter says / one day before the Lord is as a thousand peers: and
Abacut 2. says / the vision is yet differred to a cectayne time / speakinge
of that which he will finish wthout any fail / sapenge though yt tarry / wait
/ for yt shall come and not stay. With is both a compforth and a terror to
dyvers sorts of parsons: quayle not brother vnd thy cross / for the 8. of No.
says I esteem that the afflictions of this time are not worthy of the glory
that shall be showed on us / and 4. of the Cor. for our light affliction which is
but for a moment causethe unto us a far more excellent and aneternall wayght
of glory. Wherefore cease thy admirations on Gods louge sufferings and providens
/ neither mervell any more why God delayeth his help or succor sum times from
his people: for in Esaye his time the faythefull behowldinge Senacharib to be
victoriouse over dyvers people in Judea / and parceyvinge the church of God
upon the point of utter ruym / they in like weakness thought thus in effect:
Esaias has promised us ease and deliverans / but when shall this come to pass?
the Prophet intendinge to remidie such a temptacion in the 18. Chap. does
consent that there shall be sum delay: but wthall he promises two things in
Gods behaulf / first that the church shall be preserved / in the myddest of
the greatest danger / next that yt shall surely be delivered / and so sayethe
that the church will make a solemn reknowledginge of Gods goodness toward yt.

Ministers.
I have many times beheld certain ministers resort to that common plase /
though very seldom seen there any learned preacher / whom I know to be as
careful and dutiful / as the former careless and unprofitable / and therefore
the more need of this freyndly warninge / for to be less in the Exchange / and
of tener in the pulpet: rather in there studies to prepare sownd doctrine for
men's fowls / then among merchants to use tongue and ear about uncertain
news. Your standinge / and mayntenants is to be more watch full and paynefull
for your several flocks / who as they yield you large portio^s of there
te^porall things: so ought you be as liverall to theme in devine and spiritual
things / which can not be but by your better attendans on Godly studies. Be not
like such dumb and idle loyterers in the contreys as think the readinge of
there service to be as sufficient a discharge for theme as meat good enough
for there people: rather resemble such studiouse laborers / as premeditate
for doctrine and exhortarion / and as careful for good life and conversation.
I wyshe you made more conscience / in taking so much for so small pain / and
in that you buyld either little or nothing upon the fowndation mentioned by S.
Paul: upon the which sum do lay gould / silver / preciouse stones and timber /
and you either hay stubble or worce matter. The Lord quicken such that they
may be fownd buylders and furtherers / and not destroyers or hinderers / with
Vrim and Thumin / knowledge and virtue for to lighten and hely forwards ignorant
fowls to the Kingdom of heaven. Consider the better on your mutenes or base
handlinge of the text / by hearing in many pulpetts the swear sownd of learned
doctrine from the young and forward youths but pester day out of the
Universities / which should rather make you emulate to be nerer there good
begynnings / then either to envy the same or to continue at a stay. Wherefore
pray to the holy Ghost first to pardon your former negligens / next in mercy
to awaken you / whereby to offer unto God more quyck sacrifices and chasts
Vyrgins to Christ by your diligens and vigilacie / lest otherwise you lie more
open to Gods displeasure / first for bearinge the name to be that you are not:
next for kepinge out of those lyvings such good scholars and Godly men as
would be more paynefull and gayneful to yourpoore flocks compelled as sheep to
leap over your great hedges from the hard fallow to grene and better Pasture.

Now must I make you previe of a subtle and crafty deceyver amongst you /
both merchants and others: Deceyver.
who as he will take interest in the Exchange / not mussingz his lurckinge and
walkinge in that plase: evenso to often he prevayleth and gaynethe. Being once
a chayned flave / next / set at livertie and is such a conning Iuggler as
wthout much a do you can not escape his legerdemain: I mean the devil so
invisible and proud an intruder / as he dare walk not a lone among merchants
/ but in Princes courts / and a midst the best occupied assemblies in your
city. This fellow begann his prybe and envy in heaven / retaynes it in hell
/ and foweth it abroad in the world / who so powerfully worcketh as the Apostle
terms him the God of this world / by reason his kingly regiment (by
permission of the true and righteouse God) is among yerthlie and worldly
minded men more like the blind mowle in the low grownd / then the pleasant
lartk a lofte in the sky. This wily feynd geves not his onsect after his
ugly and terrible manner / but by fine fatches and angelical insinuation / so
experimented of men's dispositions by long continuans / as like the fisher he
has a contrary bayte for sundry hooks a slaight for every sin / and a
temptacion for all sorts of people. And whom he once gettethe with full fange
into his gripinge clowches he howldeth faster then catt the mowce norrishing
and fittinge theme for his pallase or dungeon / as the holy spirit frames Gods
children for the Kingdom of glory. Now to discribe further to my friends of
this invisible changer: Understand that the devil is an Angel separated from
Gyd by pride / a very nere and provokinge companion of the flesh / stirringe
it forward to wyckednes / and drawinge it back from goodness: the aucthor of
murder / threasons and envy / the root of malys / and the head of all
mischeife / so expert in his trade and proceeding in all arts as he ca^ make
great enormities to seem but light / and fools to think theme selves wise /
the greatest danger to appear none at all / and bitter things to taste sweet /
making herysie to appeee verity / obstinate standinge to be true martyrdom /
and the proud parson to thinck him self humble. Agapne note that he rather
intycethe the consent of the mind / then enforsinge or constrayning the same /
and yet he is cruel subtle / most spiteful and enviouse. In all which good
brethren I trust yon will rowse up secure nature and take a fresh occasion to
add prayer to prayer / to redeem the time / to apply your selves to the same /
and to esteem better of your spiritual armure / to make resistans rather in
the first then second assault / especially when that conninge Cook goes
abowte to sweten sin and to make it dulce and pleasant in the taste / as men
cover ratts bane under sugar or honey / so that this compaffer can most finely
sauce sin / and make rank poison to seem a pleasant morsel / as he did the
fair apple to our great grand mother Eve / and the sacramental bread and
wine / to be thought food of life to the unworthy receyver / as to Judas and
such like. This fine cook us busy every where to make sweet morsells as his
alluringe baytes to his hydden hooks. For example / whoremongers and such
carnal parsons / suffering theme selves wthout the first resistans to be chafed
by there lusts / thene Satan comes with his tempered sauce and conninge
compownds whereby he makes that sytute of concupiscens to seem so delightful as
they affect and imbrase yt to there lyves and / what thundringe soever the
scripture sownds against yt / with the like to common dronckards / whose tossed
cupp is so spiced and tempered with there masters art / as they dare defy
both laws devine and humane / despise Sermons / wife and freinde reprovinge
theme for there fault. Of the which sathanicall soldiers there be dyvers sorts /
as night dronckards / raylinge and strykinge wretches of there wyves / children
and servants / who are feign to runn into corners and hoales to avoyde there
madd dronckennes. God geve such repentans. In fine let us all be warned that
Satan's wyles / forged in his own shopp be infinite / and therefore yt behooves
changers / Cytezins / and country to stand on there guard / saying this
mercyless lion under Angelical show lies in previe wayt to catch and intrapp
at every turn. But thou tremblinge and fearful Christian thrown down by
the felinge of thy sin / no less desirouse to be freed from the burden thereof
then afraid to offend the Lord thy God / be thou of good chere wthout
tormenting of thy felinge conscience / forasmoche as by faith and grace Satan
has no part nor portion in the / hating and shunninge sin / but rather / on
theme that love and frequent sin / saying Jesus Christ wthout all stayne of
synn became synn for the / that is took on him thy sinnfull deserts / even
vndergoinge the torments of hell and death in his blessed body and soul for
thy sake and thy most happy deliverans from both / therefore be not only
daily and heartily thanckfull for this expiation of thy sin / but butifully
watch and pray against the dreggs and remnants of sin left in the for to
stryve and fight to the end: Although the strength and forte thereof was broken
I say by Christ and fastened to his cross to the everlastinge compforthe of all
such as love and fear the Lord / and be loathe to offend him by there sin.

Husbands and wyves of all sorts / likewise have there pleasurable walkinge
there at convenient times / whose honorable estate so dignified by the Son of
God / I must not forgette but put you in mind of that famous union ordained of
him / that is two in one flesh / and therefore to be of one mind in the Lord
and for theme selves. Marriage.
And generally yt must putt all the faithful in remembrans of the more happy
union and most blessed marriage between Jesus Christ and his church / and
every soul of his elect therein / being an inseperable bond / and knytt
faster then all bonds among men / and a love beyond all loves / for so
gloriouse and Princely a spowze / to take and imbrase so poor and mean an
espowzes / even the highest to abase him self to the lowest. O memorable love
and humility deservinge all praise and obedyens in all faithful parsons both
married and unmarried. And as neither water nor any flodds are able to quench or
to drown this love: so let neither carnal love in the one / nor love of the
world in the other be ever able to quench or to drown there love and lovely
hearts / to this our true lover / the fowntayne of all love. St John says he
that loves not / knowth not God: for as the ignorans of God is the cause / why
he is not loved: so the knowledge of God producethe love to him / and therefore
so far do we love God / as we know God / whereby yt is plain that they who
seek not to know God / can neither truly nor rightly love him. And I have
noted sum times in men and women who never opened book / that the love of God
was more shed abroad in there hearts / then in many that are puffed up with wind
knowledge. Heartily wishinge married folks no less to mark and digest / then
to read the words of the Apostle / in caullinge on man and wife to love one a
another / by example of Christ his incomparable love to his church in that he
gave him self for yt / cleansed and sanctified yt. Then would yt in crease there
affections and abate there discentions / and generally make both theme the
better to love one another and all others of that mystical body to rejoice
and be tenfowld more thanckfull for that spiritual conjunction / namely that
beggars bratts of no reputacion to be married and cowpled to such a heavenly
husband: whom the 45. Psa. terms a Queen / saying upon thy right hand is
the Queen in a vesture of gould / and the canticles speaking of Christ his love
to his church and people / says his left hand is under my head / and his
right hand does imbrase me / which mariageable terms by the holy Ghost /
teaches all / but more specially husbands and wyves to be so lyncked in love
as to lyve and love to gethers most affectionatly and lovingly wthout either
separation of bodies / disjunction of mynds or to lyve under iarrs and
contencions to gethers to the separation of God and Christ from sum such hearts
and howses in London / as my self and others have been weryed and greved in
laboringe for peace. But you Christian yokefellows of a contrary disposition /
I wyshe you by discreation and good watch to beware of such fearful
discords / doing your best to love still and to increase in love. For as love
is the capital affection in men and women / so the effects thereof is most
vehement / as is confirmed by Christ his words: where a man's threasure is there
is his heart / that is if God be our heavenly threasure / then is our love a
bove with him / if married folks be corporal threasures one to the other / then
the love and affection spreads accordingly / as we se perthly minded men have
there love on yerthly things. You that be married parsons / Iplie as that title
by the holy Ghost is termed honorable / so let your love / yeace and unity
to gethers / honor and dignifie that lawdable estate. For as Christ cowld not
choose any creature more apt to express our spiritual mandutation of his flesh
and blod / then bread and wine: so the holy Ghost could not find a more apt
similitude to express the spiritual bond between Christ and every faithful
soul / then the conjunction of two parsons by the knott of matrymonie.
Wherefore as marriage is a most compfortable and blessed estate to theme who are
graced to use yt well: so is yt a most bitter and tormentuouse estate to such
as love not to gethers / and as crave not for grace rightly to use yt. Now
both worshipful and commun assembly / ordinary and extraordinary changers
in that Ropall hows / I beseech you to remember / that as your life here is
uncertain and never in one stay / but like to the moon subject to chang and
alteration and in the end to death: evenso think that you must shortly cha^g
this life for a another / like your predecessors walking with you as yesterday /
and now gonn and forgotten: which must put you in mind to be so changed in
affection and conversation / as when the Lords change bell is runge to make
spedie change of the place where you are / to a another wthout any nayt / that
so you may find the happy and better Exchange for this miserable and worce /
throw the same Jesus Christ here after descrybed by a learned father / worthy
of marchinge in this time of fauls Christ's.

Yt is needful sayethe he to understand how God was borne / and how God dyed
according as the tongue of the scripture does use to speak: God-man.
which speech of Christ is dybersly before and after his incarnation. For since
that happy and miraculouse conception by the holy Ghost / we must remember
that in this unity of parson (by the which the son of God is also the son of
Marie / and by consequent the very Son of man / that the two natures remain
distinct with that which is proper to theme / and yet to be but one Christ /
being him self God-man that is Man-god / and yet notwthstandinge his Deity is
not his humanity / nor his humanity is not his Deity. This being most true
it followth / that the proprieties of the humanity (as to be borne / to eat /
drinch to die and to be buried) ought to be attributed to God / I mean the
second parson: and yet not simply according to his Devinitie / but in asmoche
as he is God-man: and on the other side / that which is proper to god / may be
attributed to this man / as to be the Son of God / eternal / almighty / and
to be ever all not simply in his humanity / but in asmoche as he is Man-God.
The which scripturely speech S. Paul uses thus that the God of glory was
crucified: again that God redeemed the church by his blodd: and S. Luke says
/ that which was conceyved in the womb of the Virgin / was the Son of the most
high: and therefore yt may be said that Marie was the Mother of God / in
asmoche as he was Man-god. That if he which was so conceyved and borne were not
very God / how should he be our savior: and if the same were so spoken in
regard of his Deity / what manner of Deity should that be to take his Deity
in the Virgins womb. As on the other side all the sufferings attributed to the
only Son of God / ought to be also understood in asmoche as he is God-man /
and not simply after his Deity distinctlie considered / in which regard the
Apostle does not barely say that God was visible / but adds in his flesh.
And S. John confesses not simply to have seen the glory of the word / but
thereto adds / the word was made flesh. S. Peter speakinge of his fuffrings
/ says not simply / for as much as Christ has suffered: but addethe in the
flesh / which was needful for our salvation / because he is Man-god that
suffered / and not simply God. For a conclusion / yt is God-man that has
fought and suffered in his humanity: and yt is the Man-god which has conquered
by his Devinitie.

To the Anabaptist T.M. prisonner at Norwch.
Some loving brother signify unto him. First he so soddanly stepping from his
spiritual mother to a new stepdame / rejecting the sweet food of the one /
and lickinge up the poison of the other / that therefore his suffringe is as
compforthless as yt is wshe and perilouse / not only in regard of his badd
opinions / but (in iustifienge his horrile errors and ill cause of bare 80.
years continuans) he condemnethe the universal church / consistinge on the
faithful Sede of Abraham in all quarters of the world / frustratinge the
preachinge of the gospel and Sacraments in all congregations before and after
that time / and deprivinge all martyrs since the coming of Jesus Christ
from the hope of there salvation / by grace and martyrdom. Wyshinge that as
he ought to distinguishe between true martyrdom and fauls: so to discern
between the seared conscience from the malignant spirit / and the salutiferous
conscience from the holy Spirit: the one gloriousely paintinge an evil cause by
his subtle elippinge and wrest of scripture / throw the which he eubowldeneth
the erringe and presumptuouse heart to suffer for error: and the other
revealinge the simple truth by plain record of the word of truth / no less
rightly illumininge / then as truly sanctifieng and compfortinge / humblinge
and mekeninge / until Joyful and constant suffering / the voice of Gods people
/ being the voice of God crieng Amen to the same. I am in fear that he and
such of my contreymen / be more infected with arrogant knowledge / then by grace
sanctified with faithful humblenes. And let him learn a lesson of the penitent
theyse suffringe with our savior: for as the one in his desperate howldnes capled
on Christ: saying if thou he that Christ / save thy self and us: so the other
humbled and fearinge God rebuked him / and there with made such a lyvely
confession of Christ to be God and man / as those herpticks may tremble at Gods
great judgments for coming so short / or rather to be contrary to the
same. First he caulled him Lord / and prayed unto him as God the bringer of
souls to his Kingdom: and next he caulled him man / saying this man has donn
nothing worthy of death / which was as excellent a confession / as yt was a
miraculouse conversion. A rude ignorant theyfe of so wicked a life / as much
unacquainted with learning as with virtue / to make such a sownd confession as yt
may beseme you and your betters to esteem him a holy Pattern to follow /
being therein nothing behynd Peter and the rest of the Apostles / so long
time taught of there master. Wherefore two fowld presoner / and the rest in
like bonds here at liberty (advowchinge that the corporal eyes and hands of
the Apostles / saw and felt the incomprehencible Devinitie / and that the same
was dead in yt self and buried) I pray you tell me first in the parson of a
man consistinge on a terrestiall and spiritual substans: could ever his soul
be either seen or felt in the handlinge of him: and will you not much more
confess that the Apostles cowld neither se nor feel the gloriouse Devinitie of
Christ / so with houlding yt self under the tabernacle of his body? next tell
me what glory / Majesty / brightness / or Kyngly estate did this poor theyfe
se with his corporal eyes / in one so base and so vildly crucified at that
time? he neither saw that splendour and glory as the Apostles did at his
transfiguration / nor the heavens open as John did / when Christ was baptized:
and thridly tell me / how be saw him to be his Lord and God / able to further
him to his Kingdom and glory / who was in the same reproach and ignominy with
him and his fellow? surely he had other clerer eyes to se God under the veil
of his flesh / then yet is granted to you Anabaptists / even spiritual eyes
and the inward sight of the heart. Deceyve not your selves in saying that you
confess Christ to be God and man / when yt is nothing so in averitie / but
rather under a clowd: because yt is with this addition / that he is the
celestial Sede of the father / or as may destone says / a man come from
heaven. If a fauls Christ be not fownd among the Anabaptists / I know not
where else. And what true peace of conscience can you have in suffringe for
such a forged Christ / as the true Christ fore warnethe us to be ware of / and
not to beleve. Dare you confess that the soul of a man (when the body is
dead and buried) is a lyve as yt is in deed and yet will blasphemousely say
that the God head of Christ dyed when his humane nature only was subject to
death? when a man hanges on the geobet / we comprehend both body and soul /
in saying the man is hanged / the man is dead / or thus the man eats /
drincketh / slepeth / all which is true towching the parson of man: but when we
speak distinctly of the natures / then neither does the soul dye / nor is
buried / neither eats / drincketh / nor slepeth. Further way and consider you
Anabaptists / whether you be the only spowze of Christ and the spiritual sede
of Abraham specifyed to be like in number to the stars of heaven / or to the
dust of the perthe? or whether to you alone and to uone other churches the
graces and gifts of the holy Ghost were first and last geven sythens
Pentecost? or whether so many thousand martyrs since Christ his assention
dyed in the Anabaptisticall faith / or in ours? and whether yt was you that S.
John beheld so great a multitude / which no men could number of all nations that
stood before the Lamb? if you so thinck / you arrogantly err with the papists
and arrians / and asmoch deceive your selves / as maliciousely accuse us and
the whole church of God reiectinge you and your vilde opinions sythens the
first hatchinge thereof by your grandsire Storck. You seek to enclose the church
with in your straight corners / as a child that would lathe the whole sea into
a little hole / or as the papists that impryson Christ his Royal body in
there wafer cake. God open your eyes.

Likewise you my contreymen / of another kind and company / removing from
campion to Norden / and from thence to Amsterdom / and now miserably rent /
divided and scattered here and there: Nordeners.
who though you howld the fundamental points of our faith with affection to
good things: yet yt is with an untempered zeal / under much weakness /
contencions and discentions joined with overwening and wrangling / whereby you
have bruised the tender reeds / quenched the smoking flax / and driven sum
into labarinthes and others into foul errors. God touch your hearts to be
warned by there perrylls / and not by singularity to fall with them into such
errors: to be less lofty / and more lowly: to esteem better of Gods churches
abowte you and to bragg less of your own / wthout Pastor and sacraments for
these 3. peers. And the Lord geve you repentans / for the want of love / year
concord and humility / the lack whereof is the cause you rather destroy then
build / mar then make scatter then gather. Wherefore you se what your busy
and vnskyllfull meddling with the discipline commes to: So that as yt is not fit
for little children to handle sharp edged tools: evenso as unfit for
unexperienced youths / to deal with the h^^es of opening and shutting / of
byndinge and loosinge / and with the sharp sword of excommunication: a worck
more beseminge grave and wise heads under more stayednes / then you of such
rashenes and vnadvysednes / mowntinge above all churches. I spare
particularities.

The Lord bless you and us all with wisdom and grace. Amen.
FINIS.
