The Causes for which the most high and mighty Prince and Lord, LORD GVSTAVUS
ADOLPHUS Of the Swedes, Goths, and Vandals King, Great Prince of Finland, Duke
of Esthonia and Carelia, and Lord of Ingria, Is at length constrained to move
with an Army into Germany.
It Is an old saying, No man has peace longer than he please his enemy. How true
it is, his Majesty of Swedeland these late years has had experience, and yet
daily has, to his great damage. For although since his reign, he has not been
more careful of any thing, than to conserve love and amity with all his
neighbors, and specially the States of Germany, whereby peace and tranquillity
might flourish every where, commerce and other Trades in time of peace be put
in use for the benefit of each Nation, yet could he not obtain any thing, but
that greater treacheries were plotted against him year by year, by those
disturbers of the common Peace, which had with fire and sword wasted almost all
Germany. His Majesty indeed was long since advised, and that not by a few of
the States of Germany, that he should look to himself betimes, while the fire
was yet burning in high Germany; and should not expect they would be ere a whit
more friendly to him if they came nearer: but that he should presently take
arms, come into Germany, and by a joint power help to quench the flame: being
assured, his own house was in danger, if his neighbors were on fire. Neither
did his Majesty want then, either a good occasion; the imitation of the
inhabitants, the instigation of forraigners: or a just cause; his friends and
confederates oppressed, who so earnestly required his aid and succor. Yet
because he always hoped, they would at length be more moderate, than so madly
to insult on his poor harmless neighborhood; measuring their actions by his
own disposition, he chose rather to commend his own welfare awhile to Gods
goodness, and the uprightness of his own conscience, than to do any thing
rashly or unadvisedly.

But when Anno 1626. in those wars between him and the King and Kingdom of
Polonia, he went into Prusia a province of that Kingdom, and began more
nearly to observe, what he might promise himself of those Incendiaries of
Germany: he then found the advice of his friends was true, and the nearer his
enemies came to the provinces bordering on the Baltique Sea, the more and
greater every day occasions of quarrel were still picked against him. For first
the same year against the law of Nations, they intercepted and broke open his
Majesty's packet to the Prince of Transylvania, put the Messenger in prison,
and to get his Majesty's ill will, published his Letters in a forged
translation. Then, when there was good hope of composing those long
controversies between Sweden and Poland by friendly treaties; Commissioners of
each Kingdom meeting year by year: yet those turbulent spirits so wrought by
their Letters and Messengers, again and again into Poland, that there should
be no peace with Swedeland, till they had workt their own ends in the Empire;
hoping that the Princes of Germany being brought in subjection, the Pole would
entreat their help for the subduing of Swedeland. And that they might be as
good as their words, and by all means possible, weaken Swedeland and
strengthen the Pole, they did not only hinder his Majesty of bringing men and
munition out of Germany, and yet gave way to the Pole for the same, being his
enemy: but also, when this seemed too little (for elsewhere and out of Germany
it self in despite of them his Majesty had soldiers enough) presently the next
year 1627. they sent the Duke of Holsteyn with a great Army against him into
Prusia: and that not under his own or the Poles, but under the Emperors
Standard.

Nor yet were they content with this hostitity, but to deprive the Kingdom of
Sweden of all commerce with men, they not only unjustly spoild his Majesty's
poor subjects coming on the German shore to trade, taking away their
commodities, and confiscating their Ships: but also did the same too by their
agents at Lubeck and the other Hans-townes, under color indeed to reserve
those commodities for them only; but indeed, that they might take them from
the subjects of the Kingdom of Swedeland, and so by this means get a Navy
together, whereby they might belch out their venom upon the Baltique Sea: as
the next year following they more openly made known under those monstrous
titles of General of the Seas, and by possessing themselves as well of the
inland places of strength, as of the Sea coast and ports of all Mechleburg and
Pomerania.

All which let a man, that can, think should have been put up, and to avoid
meddling in other men's matters, might have been past over, as long as they kept
themselves in the Continent: but after that they made choice of the Soundt for
harbor of their Pyracy, and spread themselves upon the Sea: by how much it was a
greater prejudice to all States that any way traded in those parts, by so much
the less was it to be endured by the Kings of Swedeland: specially since the
guard of those Seas have anciently belonged to those Kings.

Now when his Majesty grew so much the warier, as well by the consideration of
these injuries, as the former advises of his friends, and the next spring
again passed over into Prusia, thinking of nothing more, than to accommodate
these inconveniences in a fair course: It happened that there came
Ambassadors to his Majesty into Prusia from the Town of Stralsund, who
grievously complained, that although their poor Town had committed nothing
either against the Emperor, or Empire, or any State of the Empire, for which
it was so far from being ever cited or accused, or convicted, or condemned,
that it was declared innocent by the Imperial decree, and assured of the
raising of the Army that lay before it, notwithstanding such was the villainy of
the enemies army, that in derision of its innocence, in despite of the
Imperial constitutions and privileges, in contempt of Arnheimbius truce made
with those of Pomerland, in neglect of many other treaties of former times (by
all which they thought they were most safely provided for) nor yet considering
the unjust exaction and payment of so much money, gifts and presents, nor the
breach of both religious and politic peace: notwithstanding all these, the
said Army principally wasted the Country adjoining, built forts about the
Town, surprised the Island Dehnholm lying over against the harbor, without any
denouncing of hostility, and fortified it to their prejudice; blockt up all the
passages forward and backward from the Continent into Rugia, from the Town
into the continent; deluded the Citizens with many mock-treaties, commanded
them Garrisons when they had been exhausted with huge payments, required their
harbor and Ships and Ordnance: and when at length they were denied all these
by the free City, they closely besieged the Town, and most unworthily
persecuted it with fire and sword even to the last.

When as then the Emperors edicts took no place, the Duke of Pomerland
forsook them, and they were given for lost by the Hans-townes: by the law of
Nations, by virtue of their liberties, and after the example of their
Ancestors, they being forced to entreat help from a foreign power, till
this sudden tempest was overpast, they entertained, and but a while, the
troops of the King of Denmark, being ready at hand, for the withstanding the
furiousness of this first assault. And lest this afterward might prove
prejudicial to them, as if they had joined with the Emperors enemies, they
had no other fairer or readier course, than to put their liberties under
protection of the King of Swedeland as an indifferent and confederate Prince.

His Maje. therefore of Swedeland, considering specially, that his friends could
not now promise any good to themselves from the vast projects of so hostile an
Army: with all observing that the request of this afflicted Town was grounded
both on God and man's Law; and upon that bond of observance and neighborhood,
of the same religion and liberty, and free trade, wherein they were always
devoted as to his predecessors the Kings and Kingdom of Swedeland, so unto
himself: and lastly, in what danger not only himself, and the Kingdom of
Swedeland, but all the neighboring States be, if any private man's ambition
should set up a Rendevous for Pirates in this harbor: He could not by any
mean refuse, but send aid to the oppressed, that so earnestly desired his
helping hand, both for his friends and neighbors sake, as also for his own
safeguard and the public peace.

By which resolution of his, though it came to pass, that both Caesar's edicts
had their full authority; and the Baltique Sea was yet safe for all Nations
that had any commerce with it; and the Town of Stralsund by means of
Majesty's friendly mediation, was freed from the Garrisons of the King of
Denmark (at that time being enemies) and was restored both to his own liberty
and the Roman Empire (as those treaties with the City concerning this matter
do plainly manifest) yet was it so far from obtaining that these disturbers
of the Peace would remit any thing of their hostile attempts and designs, that
they were the more afterward enraged, and set upon its utter ruin both by Sea
and land. For when they saw themselves put beside that harbor, they set upon
Wismar and other ports: nor were they content with their own, but called a
Navy from Dantz enemies of Swedeland, to join with them, and began so to rob
on that Sea, that his Majesty at last was forced, if he would have his Sea and
trading safe, to block them up there with his own Navy at his great cost and
damage, until that year were safely past.

And that his Majesty of Swedeland might not remit any of his care and study
of the peace and quiet of these nations, but try all means to bring them to a
friendly agreement: as soon as he heard of a meeting appointed at Lubeck in
the beginning of the year 1629. for treating a peace between the Emperor and
the King of Denmark, he thought fit also to send his Ambassadors thither, who
might both accommodate this business of the Town of Stralsund, and compose
other jealousies hence arisen; and withal what they could by their mediation
bring the treaty it self to a good end. For he thought with himself, that
since most of those jealousies grew by occasion of the war between the
Emperor and the king of Denmark, there could be no peace concluded with the
King of Denmark, if Stralsund were excluded, nor yet that City bound to any
conditions, if it self were not comprehended; by reason of mutual treaties
with that town of that matter.

But though the K. of Denmark willingly admitted of this Embassage, and the
other party was as friendly desired to do the same, yet was his Majesty's
fair carriage so requited, that his solemn Embassage was not only received,
or vouchsafe any answer so much as by letters, but withal had the repulse
with a strange affront: and was commanded upon peril of what might befall them,
to forbear not only Lubecke, but the whole continent of Germany also.

Which one affront, though it has ever been esteemed by all nations worthy of
the highest revenge, and there was no cause but that the sharpest remedies
should be used: yet seeing the Emperors Commissioners, in March after, the
King of Swedens were called home, took notice of his Majesty's letters of
Embassage by other letters, wherein by way of excuse they seemed to mollify
the harshnesse of their former sentence his Majesty also was willing to think
it proceeded rather from some bad Counselors than a public resolution: and
would not yet think it sufficient, though laid to the former, to put two
States in a combustion of war. Specially since the Commissioners withal
signified that they had no commission to treat with any but the King of
Denmark: although they certainly knew, that if the matter might be referred
to the Emperor or Duke of Fridland, they should receive such an answer as
would give satisfaction.

And now his Majesty thought it not fit to let his patience so many ways
wronged, he farther abused by such scornful proceedings; withal considered
whether or no, and how the party injured might refer the business to the
Emperor (between whom and the Emperor there was not formerly wont to be any
such correspondence) all the passages in the Empire being stopped, and the
meeting at Lubecke now drawing to an end. Yet lest any labor might be spared,
or difficulty hinder the public good, all considerations to the contrary laid
aside, his Majesty was at length so far persuaded by the Parliament of
Swedeland, that presently in April he should not only write to the College of
Electors, (the maine pillar of the Roman Empire, whom such proceedings with
foreign Princes was thought much to displease) and wish them to advise of some
convenient remedies, but should also consent, that there should be one sent
from the same Parliament to the General of the Army, to try whether those
controversies which were risen between the two Armies might not be taken up
by a meeting of both. Presently there was dispatched his Majesty's Chamberlain
the Lord Steno Bielke, Lord Baron in Krokenem, with Commission that if he
found the adverse party inclined to peace, he should cause a cessation of
Arms for the City of Stralsund, until further preparatives for a treaty
being dispatched more Commissioners should follow, which should make a final
end of the whole matter.

But when at the beginning of the Spring he came to Stralsund, and found all
things worse: former hostilities not only not laid aside, but daily increased
with new ones: Stralsund oftimes since assaulted, all the Ports ready provided
to rob the Sweden Sea: and that which is most detestable, a complete Army,
without any denouncing of war sent a second time into Prusia, and that under
the conduct of Arnhembius, the Emperors Marshall of the field. This sudden
change as it was fit, stopped his farther proceedings. Yet that he would not
altogether neglect his instructions, he wrote to the Duke of Fridland, for
what cause he was dispatched, protested against the injury of the Army, and
required both it and other hostilities might be stopped, if the answer of the
Commissioners of Lubecke should go for honest.

But the Duke of Fridland was so far from recalling his Army, or showing any
readiness to treat; that for greater scorn, he made it good that the answers
of his under-commissioners were but plain mockings: contending that he could
not call back his Army, chiefly because the Emperor had so many soldiers,
that he was feign to disburthen himself by this Army of Arnhembius, and
therefore sent him not without cause to his friend the King of Poland against
Swedeland. Neither beside this would he answer any thing more to the purpose
to the iterated demands of the Ambassador: But made the said Army hasten
their journey, who fought so eagerly all the last Summer in Prusia against his
Majesty and kingdom of Sweden, that except God the just avenger of all
villainy, had turned their wicked designs on their own heads, his Majesty and
kingdom of Swedeland with all their friends had been in no small danger.

Can yet any man doubt whether his Majesty had cause enough to lay aside all
thoughts of peace, and take up Arms, and prepare himself for battle in his
own and his confederates defense?

There is one thing yet which might seem a little to hinder the hastening of
this war, and that was the expecting an answer from the College of Electors
to the Kings letters, and also the mediation of the King of Denmark (upon his
Majesty's intimation) who had already begun as soon as Winter was past to
press this matter for a treaty. For as long as by treating their could be any
satisfaction made for injuries past, or caution had for the future safeguard of
the neighboring territories: his Majesty was never so thirsty after revenge,
but that out of his zeal to the common good and public peace, he would
willingly suffer the cause to be ended by Treaty rather than by Arms.

But seeing from the beginning of April 1630. what time a day was appointed at
Dantz in Prusia* even to this month of June, there has been no signification
of a treaty made by the party injuring to the Commissioner of the party
injured (who was there present, and sent his readiness and commission to treat
as far as Dantz by letters) how truly the public peace is desired, may hence
undoubtedly be gathered. Specially, since the affronts of former times and
these which they have offered since the sending of their Commissioners to Dantz
(by possessing the strongest places and passages in Germany, and more fiercely
providing themselves to war than before times) do plainly tell us, with what
safety such a treaty is to be trusted.

As for the College of Electors, it might have done very much in this cause,
and his Majesty is persuaded it would have done, had the ancient liberty of
the States of the Empire been preserved, and the power of some Malcontents
not taken so deep root, that it seems willing to refuse all remedy at home.
It commended indeed in their late answer (which was intimated at Stockholm this
last April) the peaceable designs of his Majesty of Swedeland, and his
offering a dispatch of the cause, and they for their part offered the like
friendship. But when they did not so much as in a word touch at the remedies of
those injuries, which his Majesty's Letters specially required, did they not
leave a necessity on his Majesty to provide fit remedies for himself?
Wherefore since so many and so great indignities have been really offered his
Majesty, his packets intercepted and broke open: his Subjects, Ministers, and
soldiers spoiled and taken captive: common natural commerce interdicted: the
Pole his enemy so often dissuaded from peace: a full Army conducted into Prusia
for his Majesty's overthrow: On the other side; No passage granted his
Majesty, though he did no hurt nay his friends, his neighbors and Allies for
his sake have been oppressed, turned out of their Dominions only not quite
rooted out: his Ambassadors for peace have more than barbarously been
scornefully rejected: and lastly, a furious Army twice sent against him, and
that without the least cause or color. Are not all these, nay any of them by
the consent of Nations, by the rule of reason, and instinct of Nature
sufficient enough to take just revenge, except full satisfaction be made?
Since in contempt of all the Baltique ports, yea and sea it self, so many
threats, such stirs, such preparations, are yet on foot, whereby all
counsels actions, designs, both by sea and land seem to have been wholly
laid for his ruin. Do they not force men though unwilling to a just defense:
at least that by the law of Arms and all Nations he should in some measure
provide for his own safety?

Since after so much trial of fair means, there is now no legal remedy
left, nay nothing but hostility offered: Does not nature it self require to
try it out by the Sword? Since therefore there is no other way for his
Majesty to provide for his own safety, but in Gods name to capitulate his
own and his Allies security by Arms, he would hereby leave it to the whole
Christian world to judge into what streights he is brought, both without
desert and unwillingly. That which is objected chiefly by covetous and
ambitious men, is the protecting of the Town of Stralsund: Our defense whereof
yet they themselves caused by so many former hostile incursions: and which
afterward both in point of Honor and for many other reasons his Majesty was
persuaded would be much for the common peace of Germany, and the good of the
Empire also, as has been said.

Had indeed his Majesty any way aided either the Emperors or the Empires
enemies, had he made any truce with their foes, without just respect to them,
or had he put in execution any design tending to there prejudice, no man could
have wondered at their suspicion, if happily it should have occasioned the
retaliation of any such revenge. But now seeing his Majesty has been always
so constant to his intentions of Peace, that not only during the wars in
Germany he has inviolably kept friendship and stood Neutrall: but neither
before not since has given any just color of offense, no not in the least
matters, he cannot but with grief complain to the whole world of so great
indignities.

Wherefore seeing his Majesty protests he enters not upon this war for any
prejudice of the Empire, (between whom and his Majesty there is no enmity)
but only for the maintayning of his own and his Allies, and the common
liberty, until such time as his friends and neighboring confederates shall be
in the same state, wherein before this war they peaceably and of along time
flourished, and that the City of Stralsund, the Baltique Sea and Kingdom of
Swedeland may for hereafter promise themselves more security So he doubts not
but the indifferent Reader, nay the safety only of these Nations, will abhor
and detest the unjust proceedings of the adverse party, as they truly deserve
and is confident, that the more indifferent of the German Nation, yea all
Christendom will favor his upright and just way of proceeding by Arms,
directed only for a fair suppressing of so unjust a persecution.

FINIS.
