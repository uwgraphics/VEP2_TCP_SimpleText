PRACTICES touching the state of FRANCE, discovered by an ITALIAN, a gentleman
of FLORENCE.

Printed. 1575.

To all Princes, Lords, Gentlemen, and all other good and legitimate
Frenchmen, as well of the one as of the other religion. etc.
IN the Month of May this last year. 1574. trauayling from Florence toward
Millan, I by chance met with a Florentine gentleman, who, after certain
embrasinges and acquaintance taken by reason of some former knowledge both at
the court and at Paris, used such courtesy and honesty toward me, that of
force I was compelled not to leave his company, before I had visited his
mansion house, whereas having for the space of two days enterteyned me with
very good cheer, I having pulled on my boots, determining to return whither
as especially my way lay, and being ready to take my leave of him, he brought
into my chamber a pourse, containing by estimation (considering the greatness
and weight of the same) a thousand or xii. hundred crowns, desiring me to
take so much thereof as my self thought good, for the which, (notwithstanding
I had thereof great need,) yet determining to make of necessity virtue
according unto my duty I thanked him, persuading my self tha^ at Millan I
should meet some friend who would lend me so much. But he having showed me, yt
knowing from how long and tedious a journey I now was returned, he was not also
ignorant how sore it had consumed my coin, wherefore he earnestly entreated me
not to conceal my necessity, but willed me in any wise to take my commodity
of his store as him self in like case would do with mine, whereupon doubting
least some of my train had revealed unto him my estate, as in very deed the
next day I learned who had committed this offense) I made him answer that
seeing he would needs do me such a pleasure, I would willingly borow of him two
hundred crowns, I had scarcely said the word but presently he told me out
three hundred pistolets upon my own band which I delivered unto him sealed and
subscribed with my own hand, which with great dificoulty I forced him to
take, and besides that he used toward me so much verteous and honest
communication with such thanckes for that I had so much pleasured him as to
come and visit his house, and so largely opened my self unto him, that if the
opinion of Pithagoras were as certain as in deed it is false, I should have
occasion to think that the soul of some Frenchman of the former time,
reteyning yet the tas^ of his former Adam, had been lodged in the body of this
man, even from the day of his birth. Whereupon I am so greatly bound unto him,
that I doubt I never shall be able sufficientlye to discharge my self, and yet
is it but small, in respect of that wherein all Frenchmen are bound to him
generally, and my self perticulerly, in that after large communication of the
miseries of France, with the water in his eyes, he drew out of a small box two
leaves of paper written in Italian speech and letter, and delivered them unto
me to read, wherein I satisfying his expectation, and being come unto the last
side, not giving me leave to finish the same, he desired me to keep and
translate it into French, to the end I might send the copyes unto my friends,
because he knew it most necessary to publishe the contents thereof. Oh how good
a man he was, I would to God that all Italians which be in France were like to
him, and that they were as good Christians as I know him to be: Wherefore
seeing that although the promise which I made unto him, yt in this his request,
I would not fail him, touched no other but him self only, yet could I not be
quiet* before I had accomplished his intent, so highly do I find my self
bonnde unto him, with much more reason the^ ought I now to proceed in the same,
least I should to greeuouslye swerve from my duty toward my country, in as
much as indifferently it concerns all frenchmen in general, also because the
effect of the publishing of the same, may stop the course of the most cruel
and tirannous practices that ever were conspired in Christendom, as all men
may perceive in taking so much pain as to read my translation of the before
named two sheets of paper. The which to the same end I have dedicated unto
all my Lords the princes of the blood, other Princes, Lords and gentlemen,
and unto all other good and legitimate Frenchmen, of what estate or condition
soever they be, as well of the one religion as of the other, according to the
counsel of this honest Florentine, with most humble supplication unto all such
as I do owe the same, and most earnest request unto all other, that they will
accept the zeal and good will as well of the Florentine, as of the translator
hereof with as good a heart, as the translator does pray unto God long and
blessedly to preserve the^ in health and prosperity, attendyng his own
opinion hereupon, which he will place in the end of the aforesaid discourse.

The preface of the Florentine.
SInce Saint Bartlemewes day, at what time the most cruel and detestable
murders which ever were committed had driven me out of France, by reason of
the simple safety which I perceived that honest men should in time to come
enjoy in those countries, I have diverse times thought upon a discourse, which
once I heard given in the presence of the King, the Q. mother, my Lord the
Duke* since K. of Poole, and now King of France, and the County of Re^z, being
at Bloys in the year. 1572. a little before the Q. of Navarre lately deceased
came thither, and it was made by a gentleman, named the Knight Poncet, whom as
I have since learned, the County of Retz had sent for into Germany, for that
he had heard him accounted to be a man of great forecast, judgment, and
discourse, who also had lived eight or nine years in Turquye, and now having
sundry times with my self weyed the said discourse, I perceive that out of
the same might be spronge the original of the aforesaid murders, rather then
of any other thing. And therefore because that by diverse things which since
the same discourse have cha^ced, all men might more assuredly judge of the
same, unless my opinion deceives me, I thought my self bound to put the
same in writing, and to the end that I might shake of all name of
vnthanckfulnesse, for such great courtesies, favors, and benefits, as in the
space of 18. years which I spent in that country, I had received of the good
and myld French nation, to give the same unto some such person as might
admonish them thereof, to the end that fynding my judgment not to be far
amiss, they might take heed unto them selves and look better to their own
affairs, then hitherto they have done, and so to prevent such pernicious
practices as might be put in execution against their persons and estates. The
said Knight Poncet, in his discourse did first let them understand in how
many Countries, Principalities, Kingdoms and Monarchies he had been, then that
in any of the same he could never find any perfect obedience unto the
sovereign, except in Turquy only, and that the same there proceeded principally
of the causes which hereafter shall be expressed.

First the Turk has no prince or great Lord throughout his Empire but such as
him self have created and made of his own liberality and proper cost, neither
suffers he any such to ascend so high, but that he may pluck down and
dispatch them at his own will and pleasure.

Secondly, he permits no other nobility to be in estimation through out his
empire, but his Ianissaryes, who being from their chyldehood by him brought up
and enterteyned as his own creatures, are so bound to his devotion, that by
their means and by the auctority of his ministers and officers, all kind of
obedience is presented unto him, as well by the mean man as by the welthy
person, neither is there any kind of account of preeminence, by reason of any
antiquity or greatness of houses and families, nor any excuse for any man not
to obey him whom the Turcke puts in office.

Thirdlye, he never permits throughout his own dominions any other
religion then him self does exercise, except in those countries which he has
lately conquered, whom he will not constrayne to alter their profession,
because by such means he may the more easily enlarge his limittes, and yet
there, no man is permitted to dispute of religion. Moreover in all the
countries of his dominions, are no Lordships nor seigniores, for all the lands
belong to himself, and those does he by his officers, ferme out unto his
subjects for a few years, which being expired, the farmers or possessors are
driven to purchase a new grant, and the same to acknowledge from five years,
to five years, insomuch that no man can say, that that which he possesses is
his own, and so every man endeavors more and more to show his obedience, to
the end that thereby he and his children may continue in possession in the said
farms, and by this means the great Turcke is continually so well stored with
riches, that upon no kind of occasion he ever is forced to raise taxes or
subsidies of his subjects.

Moreover, there be neither fortresses, neither any wauled towns in the heart
of his Empire, nor in any other places, but only on the borders and a few
other, in the which his officers and Cap- (...) pleasures of Kings, whereby
the said Princes and great Lords may rightly be termed controulers and
hinderers of the Kings wills, and this proceeds of the unity and agreement
of the said three estates, and therefore it is said that Kings be chief
Lords and masters in outward appearance, but in effect they are as it were
subject to their own subjects, in that they can not accomplish their own
desires, and that their own mocions and reasons for the most part be never
accepted, notwithstanding diverse times they tend to the augmenting of their
living, and sometimes to the aid of the necessity of their affairs, and
therefore the sooner to dispatch himself of the said Princes and great Lords,
with the rest of the nobility, to the end by that means the straightlier to
subduce the rest, and so to dispose and alter all things after his own
pleasure and will, it were necessary to use the troubles for religion, for that
they be the best instruments that might be wished to murder and slay on all
parts, and yet not to reject such means as the peace might minister, and
which might be executed as well by the parties grieved, as by such as be
engaged and bound to his majesty's service, as the affairs may best minister
occasion, also that hereof, they shall find choice of devises and inventions
enough among the ashes of debate and hatred, which the said troubles and
deuisions have brought forth. In the mean time to labor by all means
possible for the deminishing of the said Princes, Lords, and nobility, as
well in persons, as in goods, and not to grant them any thing whereby to
obtain greater numbers of servants and bondslaues to them at his majesty's
charges, it is necessary that his majesty absteyne from giving any rewards
and recompenses at the suites of the said Lords, or of any other then of such
as shall be found trusty, and whom his majesty myndeth to prefer unto
their dignities. Also yt if it were possible, it were good that such as receive
any liberality should come to his own presence, to the end they might
perceive unto whom they were principally bound, and this ought especially to be
observed among those unto whom his majesty shall commit any public offices,
who also after their dispatches should be brought to take their leaves of his
majesty, whereby he might let them know, him self to have been the only
motioner of this honor and commodity, also that he might command them
whatsoever his majesty should thinck good, for this be aling would greatly
bind them unto him and be very profitable. Moreover that the decayed and
ruinous castles and charges should be given to ye said Princes, Lords, and noble
men which should remain, until the time were come that they might be
dispatched. Also that in the mean time none of their estates, pentions, or
wages, should be given to any other of them, then to such as his majesty
should see good, and that so by all means possible, their commodities might be
taken away, or at the leastwise hindered, for that by those means he might be
the better assured of them, and keep them from practicing any great
enterprises, but all must be wrought artificially and under fair prete^ces.
Also that his majesty should not permit any assembly of estates to be holden
either generally or perticulerly* for that they serve only to bridle Kings
more and more, but rather he ought severely to punish all procurers of the
same, whereby the Kings shall never be without occasion to dispatche such as
should be odious unto the^^ and thus after that his majesty be dispatched of
all his Princes, Lords and nobility as is aforesaid, he may easily atteyne
unto the rest, when as all the chief force and principal part of the said
estates shall be void, and that his majesty has with the time, made and
created others to his own mind, for the common people of themselves dare not
practice any thing, unless they have some great Captains which will either
bear them out in their doings, or egg them forward to their practices.
Likewise his majesty having made a peace, should in any wise punish, and for
the smalest occasion that might be, put to death all such governors and
officers of towns, as during these troubles, have been contrary to his
service, for because at the first blast of any contrary wynd, they will not
fail but revolt, to the end to exempt themselves from such pain and
punishment as they should fear to have justly deserved for their former
follyes and offenses. Also at such time as his majesty has reduced his
subjects to this obedience, the people dare not with stand the beating down of
fortresses, and vnma^teling of walled towns in the heart of his kingdom, or in
any other place where his majesty shall think them hurtful: For assuredly
the great number of Castles and walled towns, do especially encorage
seditious and evil disposed persons, to the practices of such enterprises, and
do make the inhabitauntes of the same more haughty and less obedient: And
doubtless the great number of towns in France were in times paste, built by
sundry Lords, Princes, and common wealths, which enjoyed several dominions,
and then served for bulwarckes and defenses to the one against the others,
neither were they gotten and incorporate unto the crown as presently they be,
insomuch that that, belonging now to one only, which was wont to serve diverse,
we must needs confess that, in that the pluralityes and diversities of the
grauntes of the said towns does cease, consequently such of them as are
situate in the heart of the realm, and far from the borders, are not only to
no use, and unprofitable, as touching the defense and conservation of the
kingdom, but contrariwise, stand in election to be occasions of diverse evil
demeanures and dealinges.

As concerning religion, at what time his majesty has atteined ye commodity
and profit aforesaid, then may he easily force all men to receive either his
own, or any other that his majesty shall think good of, and so not to permit,
but one only throughout all his dominions and countries, which will be far
more assured and strengthened, in case his majesty would forbid all
disputations of his said religion. Hear upon the time drawing on to go to
mass, the assembly brake up, and the said Poncet was entreated to set down
these means which he had discovered and discoursed upon, with such addicions
as him self should think good, and that not without great promises and hope of
wonderful commodity and reward.

The translatours opinion.
COnsidering and with my self conferring this brave discourse, with such
things as I know have passed in France within these few years, and yet daily
do continue, I find the same to be diligently kept, and in all points
observed, without omitting any parcel thereof, as plainly and openly I could
declare and represent to all men's view, were it not that I fear through my
discontinewing of a courtiers life in France, I should forget and ouerslippe
some of the principal and most necessary occurrences, which especially might
procure a more assured judgment, which such men may better understand and
know, as more ordinarely be resident at the court, either in Paris, or in any
other part of France, then I: among whom it cannot be, but that there is some
one, who will in part discharge his duty unto his country, parents and
friends, and to the rest of his posterity, if he does consider the
weightinesse and dangerous consequence of the said discourse, the which
whenever there be any talk of peace, all such as are deputed to the same,
should continually remember and wisely consider.

Fare ye well.
