TO MY VERY KIND AND LOVING UNCLES, Mr. NICOLAS CRISPE And Mr. ELLIS CRISPE,
with theirs.
BEloved in Christ Jesus; that which was preached sometime at the request of
the one of you, unto A meeting of the Worshipful Company of Skinners.

jointly to you both* (and well to you both, by (...). Chrysostom. in Romans hom. 19

far severed in abode, and combined sweetly in the holy band of true Love. The
maine subject Matter of it is nothing in effect, but a Motive or incitement
unto that, which it stands us all upon, in the first place, and with our best
care and endeavor, as well to seek after, as to seek into: To seek into,
that we may know it, and learn it; to seek after, that we may be possessed
and seized of it. Since it is that alone wherein Psalm. 84.4, 5, 10, 11, 12.

not the bare notice of it, but the owning and enjoying of it, that can make
men truly and eternally happy. That we may therefore know and understand what
it is, wherein it consists, and by what means it may be attaineds (And
Praeparatio enim rerum cognitio est, Bern. ibid.
till we be thus acquainted with it, we can never come to be possessed of
it) we must make diligent (...), Ioh. 5.39.

Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom here propounded; together with the
Conditions and Capitulations required on the part of all those that are to
partake in it, and the royal Privileges and Prerogatives annexed thereunto;)
if we desire or expect ever to have part and portion therein. But because Ar^

on all such our courses and endeavors either public or private, that he will
be pleased with his good Spirit to second and assist his own Ordinances, that
thereby Psalm. 119.18.
the eyes of our minds may be opened, and Ephesians. 1.18. Luke 24.45.
our understandings so illightened, that we may be able in some due measure to
see and discern this estate what it is, and to conceive and apprehend the
Mysteries appertaining unto it. Again, because it will little avail us to know
it, unless we have our share in it* to be well seen in the Statutes and
Ordinan^^^ of it, unless we have part in the Immunities and Roialties that are
therein to be enjoyed: (It is but a double misery for a man to know what is to
be had, if he have it not himself:) Our next endeavor therefore must be (for
the effecting whereof also Psalm. 86.11. and 119.33, 34, 35, 36. Ephesians. 3.14 -- 19.
the assistance of Gods Spirit is humbly and instantly to be craved) to have
that which we have learned, or do learn, out of Gods word, concerning this
Royal and blessed estate, to be effectually Iam. 1.21, 2^. 1 P^t. 1.23.
wrought into us: (and indeed till it be so wrought into us, it is Io^. 6.45.
Ephesians. 4.20, 21, 22, 23. Vide (...). ^ez. ibid. 1 Io^. ^.3, 4. ^ 4.7, ^.
never truly, sou^dly, or effectually learned of us:) That is, we must strive
and labor to have true faith, repentance, and other spiritual graces surely
James 1.2^. Ephesians. 3.17.
settled in our souls; whereby we may both have a right and title to this
Kingdom, and be in some good sort and measure also possessed and seized of it.
The rather since that Apoc. 20.6. Matthew. 19.28. John 3.3, 5.
after this life none shall partake in it, but those only that in some d^gree or
other were possessed of it, while they lived here. As it is with us therefore
in regard of worldly possessions; so should it be in regard of this heavenly
Inheritance. For worldly possessions, we will get, if we can, a title to them;
when we have it, we will be sure that our title be good, and use all means to
make it sure: and when we have so done, we are not yet then at rest neither;
we cannot be quiet, till we be seized and possessed of it, yea til we be in
an absolute, quiet, and peaceable possession, not of some part of it, but of
the whole. In like manner should it be with us for this Hebr. 3.1. 1 Pet. 1.4.
heavenly Inheritance: we must first labor to get a (...), Ius, Bez. John 1.12.
right and title unto it: which by Ibidem.
faith must be procured: for it is that alone on our part, that by Romans 3.23,
24, 28. and 5.1, 2.
Justification and free Galat. 3.26.
Adoption gives us a title thereunto. In the next place we must endeavor to
get some 2 Pet. 1.10.
good assurance that this our title to it is good: that which must by the 2
Cor. 13.5.
trial of our faith be effected* For See the Signs of Sincerity on Psalm.
97.11.
(to omit, that by seeming titles many often are deluded) though our title to it
be never so good, yet we may not be aware of it, and so miss may we of much
comfort, until we have taken some due trial of it. And lastly, we must strive
and contend to get our selves more and more possessed of it: which must be done
2 Pet. 1.4 -- 8.
by the 2 Timothy 1.6.
exercise and Luke 17.5. 1 Thessalonians. 4.1, 10.
growth of our faith, and other the graces of God in us, and by 1 Thessalonians. 5.19,
20
a constant usage of all good means whereby the same may be 2 Pet. 2.1, 2.
nourished, Ephesians. 3.16.
corroborated, and Ephesians. 4.15, 16.
increased. For Romans 6.6, 14. Col. 3.5, 8, 9, 10.
the more spiritual grace spreads and grows powerful in us, the more
ground get we of our corrupt nature: And Romans 6.11, 22.
the more conquest we make of this our inward corruption, the further proceed
we in possession of this our Ephesians. 2.5, 6. Philip. 3.20.
heavenly Inheritance. Now because so long as we live here in Philip. 3.12.
an estate of Imperfection, (for Philip. 3.13. 1 Cor. 13.9, 10, 11.
no perfection is to be had, or to be hoped for of us while we are here) we can
never fully be acquainted with the Rules and Rights of this Kingdom, or the
parts and parcels of this Inheritance: For so long as 1 Cor. 13.9, 11.
we know these, as 1 Cor. 8.1, 2.
all other things, but in part, Maxima pars little quae scimus, est minima eorum
quae ignoramus, Aug.
we cannot but of some part of them remain ignorant still: Nor can we attain to
such a full and plenary assurance of our right to it, but that some doubt and
scruple about it will be sometime troubling us: For since that as our other
parts, so Mat. 6.30. and 8.26. and 14.31. and 16.8. Luke 17.3, 4.
our faith also is imperfect; and our notice of it as weak ordinarily, as our
faith it self is; and that where faith is so imperfect, there must needs be
some Mark. 9.24. Idem simul, qui nondum perfect crediderat, and credebat, and
incredulus erat, Greg. in Ezech* 15.
infidelity more or less mixed with it; it can hardly be avoided but that some
Fides vera cum dubietatis aura, Idem Mor. l. 10. c. 8.
wavering should be: especially considering that we have to deal with a most
wily Adversary, that is wont often to be questioning of this our right and title,
and by many subtle quirkes, and fallacies, and colorable pretenses,
endeavoring to shake this our assurance: And much less can we attain to any
full and absolute; (while but Romans 8.23. and 7.25.
in part as yet we are sanctified, and but Romans 5.2. and 8.24.
in hope only glorified;) yea or quiet and peaceable possession of it* Romans
7.17, 20.
the enemy being and abiding yet within our gates, and Romans 7.23. Gal. 5.17.
daily working our disturba^ce: For this cause therefore, and in regard hereof,
is our Seeking of this Kingdom, not to be practiced for a spurt, or taken up
for some time, and then to be let fall and laid down again, as if no further
need were of it, but Psalm. 24.6. and 27.8. and 105.3, 4.
last it must, and continue Apoc. 2.10, 26.
so long as this life lasts. Still Prove. 2.3, 4. Romans 12.2.
searching we must be into it, that we may 2 Pet. 3.18.
grow better acquainted with it: and still Apoc. 32.
strengthening our assurance, that we may take Apoc. 3.10, 11, 12. 2 Thessalonians. 2.15.
faster hold of it: and still striving to Phil. 1.9, 10, 11. 2 Pet. 3.18.
grow in grace, that we may 2 Pet. 1.11.
get further possession of it: And a principal part must it be of our daily
Prayer, that Matthew. 6.10.
This Kingdom may come; that not only it may Luke 17.21. Vt in nos veniat,
Ambr. Dion. de Sacr. l. 5. c. 4. Et in nobis maneat, Tertull. ad Marc. l. ^.
come into us to take possession of us, but that Matthew. 25.34. Ne forte veniat,
and nobis no^ veniat. Multis enim non est obventurum, quod est tamen venturum,
Aug. hom. 42.
we may come at length also to a full fruition of it, 1 Pet. 1.9.
attaining to the Romans 8.22.
end of our faith, and hope, and sanctification, the eternal 2 Thessalonians. 2.13.
salvation of our souls and Romans 8.23, 24. Philip. 3.21.
bodies. This is the course that in this discourse you are encited unto; which
I doubt not but that you have also made both an happy entrance into, yea and
good progress in already; yet if any spur may be found therein, that may
help to prick you on (or any of you, or any other that have more need than
you) to a more eager (...), Phil. 3.13, 14.
pursuing, putting on, and pressing hard (with the Apostle) to the marke-ward,
for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus; or if any rub may
thereby be removed, that either has been, or hereafter may be cast into your
way, either by the World, or John 12.31. and 16.11.
the Prince of it, or any homebred confederate of his, whereby you might be
(as the people were by 2 Samuel ^0.12.
Amasaes corpse) either stayed, or turned aside, or disheartened, or slacked in
this your religious course; a plentiful recompense I shall esteem it of my
pains therein taken, and I beseech God to that purpose to give his blessing
thereupon. I have unto the Sermon annexed a short Catecheticall Sum, which
may help, though not your selves, being now past such helps, yet your younger
ones, that are 1 Cor. 3.1, 2. Hebr. 5.12, 13.
not past the breast yet, (for which sort in mine own Family at first I
contrived it;) in the enquiry after, and discovery of the way to this Kingdom*
wherein from the grounds of sacred Scripture is briefly declared, how at first
we were Constituti.
possessed of it* how we came to be Destituti.
deprived of it, and by what means we may be Restituti.
restored again to it: As also it may help to fit and prepare them for the
participation of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Commending both to Gods
Blessing, and my self to your Prayers, I take leave, and rest

Yours in the Lord Jesus, THOMAS GATAKER.

THE CHRISTIAN MAN'S CARE.
MATTHEW. 6.33. Seek first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness: and all
these things shall be added unto you.


IT is the wonted manner of Physicians, Erumpens sanguis vena secta s^stitur.
Fernel. method. med. l. 2. c. 6.
when blood issues out immoderatly one way, to open a vein elsewhere, and so

addicted unto, and carried after the things of this world; he endeavors in
this place to withdraw them therefrom, and so to cure them of this running
disease, by diverting and turning the tide and stream of them another way.
Drift.
And as the Apostle would have us turn al our worldly grief into 2 Cor. 7.10.
godly grief, into sorrow for our sins; and our Savior elsewhere, all our
worldly fear into godly fear, into Matthew. 10.28. Timor^ timore pellit, ut
clavum clavo
fear of offending and displeasing God almighty; so here he wills us to
turn all our worldly care into godly care, our care for this life, Sum.
and the things of this life, into care for the things of another, of a better
life.

Branch 1.
Seek first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness.

Now because many Lu^. 12.29.
doubts and distrustful thoughts might hereupon arise in weak or worldly men's
minds, how they should be provided for, and furnished with meat, drink, and
apparel, and other necessaries of this life; that they may beg or starve, if
they look not after the world: Our Savior for the better strengthening of
their faith herein and further encouragement hereunto, assures them that upon
their due and diligent pursuit of the one, God himself will be mindful of
them, to supply them with the other; these things that they now thirst after,
and take so much thought for, shall upon their so doing, without their further
care be cast in upon them, and Non ait, (...), dabuntur; sed (...), addentur,
(...), velat add^tamentum: Metaphora ab eis qui poma, pyra, etc. emunt. Piscat.
(...). Chrysostom. in Matthew. 22. Non ait, dabuntur, sed, adj^cientur. Aliud est
enim quod principaliter datur, aliud quod superadditur. Greg. Moral. l. 15. c.
20.
added as an overplus or an advantage thereunto.

And all these things shall be added unto you. Branch 2. Division. Parts 2.
Part 1. Part 2.


So that the words, you see, divide themselves into two General Parts; An
Exhortation, And a Motive to induce thereunto.


But for further light and help we may subdiuide them into these four
Particulars; Members 4. Member 1. Member 2.
1. An Act, what we must do, Seek: 2. The Object of this Act, what it is that
we must seek, Gods Kingdom and his righteousness: 3. The Order and Manner,
Member 3.
how and when these things must be sought, in the First place: 4. The Benefit
that thereby will accrue unto us (...). Chrysostom* in Mat. hom. 22.
And all these things shall be added unto you. Member 4.



To begin with the First, Seek.

Spiritual things must be sought.

Coloss. 3.1.
Seek the things that be above, says the Apostle Paul. And, Member 1. Act.
Observat. 1.
Romans 2.7.
To those that by continuance in well doing seek glory, and honor, and
immortality, says the same Apostle. And, Matthew. 13.45.
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a Merchant that seeks precious Pearls, says
our Savior.

Sought thus they must be in two respects,

Ratione difficultatis.
In regard of the Difficulty, Respects 2.


And Ratione d^gnitatis.
in regard of the Dignity of them.

First in regard of the Difficulty of obtaining them: Respect 1.
Prius est quaerere qua^ acquirere.
because Without seeking they will not be had.

1. Things must be sought, Reason 1.
that cannot easily be compassed; such (...). Plato Cratyl. and Hippia maj. and
de rep^b. l. 4. Plut. de Paedag. Difficilia quae praeclara. Sine studio et
ardore quoda^ me^tis in vita nihil qui^quam fit egregium. Cic. de orat. lib. 1.
all things of worth and weight are ordinarily, and such also these are. They
are compared to a Kingdom both here, and often Mat. 3.2. and 5.3. Iam. 2.5. 2
Pet. 1.11. Apoc. 1.9.
elsewhere: And a Kingdom, we know, is not easily conquered: a Crown is not
ordinarily compassed with ease. It is not won commonly without battle; nor
bought but with blood. They are compared to Matthew. 13.44.
treasure, and matter of 1 Timothy 6.6.
gain. And worldly Wealth, we well know, (and the heavenly much more) will
not be gotten but with labout and travel.

2. Things must be sought that are not natural, Reason 2.
that come not by kind. So (...). Aristot. Ethic. Nicom. l. 2. c. 3.
Arts and Sciences, (because Nemo nascitur artifex. Nemo nascitur sapiens. Sen.
de Ira, lib. 2. cap. 10.
no man is borne an Artist) must by study and industry be attained. And much
more then this Ars artium regimen animarum. Gerson. de Recid. pecc. Ars est
bonum fieri. Ad hoc, sed non cum hoc nascimur. Sen. ep. 9.
Art of Arts; this Ars regnandi.
Art of reigning; this Ars been beateque vivendi. (...). Epict. Arian. l. 3.
Ars vitae. Cic. Tuscul. l. 2. Ars vitae recte agendae. Sen. ep. 94. Ars been
vivendi. Idem ep. 90. Virtus ars est been vivendi. Aug. de ciuit. l. 4. c. 21.
Art of happiness. Rowse.
Art of living well and happily, yea of living everlastingly, Non dat natura
virtutem. Non contingit virtus animo nisi instituto and edocto, and ad summum
assidua exercitatione perducto. Sen. ep. 9.
will not without much study and industry be learned: especially lighting
upon such blocks, as we all are naturally, being borne Job 11.12. Psalm. 73.22.
Prove. 30.2. Ier. 10.14.
stark idiots, and of our selves wholly 1 Cor. 2.14. (...).
incapable of ought in it.

3. Things must be sought, that are not every where to be had: as foreign
commodities that must be far fecht. But such is 2 Pet. 3.13. Mat. 13.45.
(...). Macar. homil. 38. Praeclara rara.
the Righteousness spoken of in this place. Reason 3.
It is a simple that every soil will not bear: a rare drugge that every
country or climate will not afford. Eccles. 7.29.
It grew once in Paradise. But upon the fall of our first Parents, -- Terras
Astraea reliquit. Ovid. Met. lib. 1. Neglecta terras fugit Astraea. Memor.
Octav. 2.1. -- ad sup^ros Astraea recessit. Iuven. sat. 6. Terra cessit, in
coelumque migrauit. Lact. Instit. l. 5. c. 5.
it left this world; and it is Job 28.13, 14.
not now to be found here on earth, in the land of the living. It must be
fetched again, as ( Hesiod. Oper. l. 1.
they say) fire was by Prometheus from heaven. Iam. 1.17.
Every good giving, and every perfect gift, says S. James, comes (...), ut
Act. 14.17. vel (...). Mat. 21.25. i. a D^o. Drus. in prove. and q^aest. l. 2.
c. 61.
from above.

4. Things lost must be sought ere they can be again found. So our Savior
says, Luke 19.10.
he came to seek what was lost. And Luke 15.8, 9.
the Widow in the Parable, by seeking found her lost Dram enim valebat 7.
denarios cu^ dimidio. Breerwood de number. Iud. cap. 1.
test^r. Such are these, we had them once, but we have now lost them. Our first
Parents were (...) i. in ostro nati: uti Claudian. nup. Honor. and Mar.
borne, as I may so say, with this Genesis 1.26, 27. Eccles. 7.29.
royal robe; Reason 4.
they were created with this Psalm. 8.5.
imperial Crown. But the Devil stripped them of it; P^rrexit pomum, and
surripuit paradisum. Bernard. de Grad. humil. 4.
he cheated and coosened them of this Crown, as we use to do Children, with
Genesis 3.5, 6.
the Apple, or Ficum vult Moses Bar-Ceph. and Theod. in Genesis quaest. 28.
Mal^granatum Machmed. in Alcoran. Malum Medicum alij, alij Persicum, quod Pe^^e
G^ll. Alij pomum Paradisi, prout fructum quendam Syri indigetant. Sed and Malum
ex Hebr^i^ quidam ex Cant. 2.3. vide Perer. ad Genes.
what ever fruit it were, that he tendered unto Eve. So they lost it: and their
posterity must recover it, ere they can enjoy it; they must win this Crown
again, before they may wear it.

Thus you see then that these things must be sought in regard of the hardness
and difficulty, because otherwise they cannot be had. Respect. 2.


Now they must again be sought in regard of the dignity of them. Which worth
and dignity of them appears in the next Point.

Uses 2.
But before we pass to that, the Use of this in a word.

Use 1. Confutation.
And the First use hereof may be for Confutation, to control the vain conceits
of those that think that these things will come without seeking; Credunt
dormientibus sibi haec co^fectur^ Deum. Ter. Adelph. 4.5. Non cura^t quaerere,
quae tame^ desiderant invenire: cupiunt co^sequi, non and sequi. Bern. in Cant.
2.
that hope to have them though they never once look after them, or the means
whereby they may be attained; that make account that heaven and happiness will
drop into their mouths, if they do but gape when they lie a dying, and say,
Lord have mercy upon me, or, Lord help me to Heaven. It were to little purpose
for our Savior to incite us here to seek thus after them, if without such
seeking they might be had. No, Prove. 2.4. (...). Menand.
If thou seek for it, says Solomon, as for silver, and search for it, as for
treasure, etc. And God, says our Savior, will have us Matthew. 7.7. (...).
Sophocl. Plut. de fortun.
ask that we may have, and seek that we may find, and knock that it may be
opened unto us. And as he adds there, that Matthew. 7.8. (...). Idem. Nil tam
difficile, quin quaerendo investigari possiet. Ter. Heaut. 4.2
He that seeks finds: so Illud desperandum est, posse nobis casu bonum
tantum contingere. Sen. ep. 50.
certain it is, that he that seeks not, is never like to find ought.

Use 2. Conviction.
Another Use hereof may be for Conviction, to convince many Nemo in sapientiam
incidit. Nulli sapere casu obtigit. Sen. epist. 76. Et cui credere contigit?
Bern. de Consid. lib. 3.
not to have what they profess and pretend to have. For how many pretend title
to, and claim interest in this Kingdom, that never took pains or labor
about the compassing of it? How many profess themselves to be possessed of the
Righteousness here spoken of, that never traveled or labored in the
searching out of it, or in the seeking after it?

He would be d^emed a most vain man, that would boast and bear men in hand
that Quomodo Caius Caesar Gall^^ Graecisque aliquot un^ c^ndemnatis,
Gallograeciam se subegisse g^oriabatur, cum pedem Italia non e^tulisset. Et
Occanum ipsum deuicisse, cum legionibus signo dato imperasset, ut conchas per
otium in litore l^ger^n^. Sueton. C^io. cap. 29. and 46. Et Domitianus qui
falsum a Germania triumphu^ egit, emptis per commercia, quorum habitus and
crines in captivoru^ sp^ciem formarentur. Tacit. Agric. Ac si quis de
certaminibus gloriose peractis gloriaretur, qui nec oleum quidem quo ungi
solebant athletae, oculis unquam usurpasset, ut Theocrit. idyl. 4.
he had been at the East Indies, conquered a great part of the Country, and
brought away much treasure and rich commodities from thence, who yet had never

And no less vain are they, that would have men believe them, that they have
made conquest of the Spiritual Canaan, and possessed themselves of much of the
wealth and treasure of it; when as they never yet stirred once out of the
mystical Egypt, never so much as enquired the way to it, much less ever
traveled toward it. He would be deemed most ridiculous, that would profess
Acsi eruditum se quis jactaret, (...), qui nec Aesopum unquam didi^isset: ut
Aristoph. avib.
to have rare skill in the Mathematickes, or some other abstruse Science, when
he had never spent day or hour in the study thereof. And no less ridiculous
are they that will seem to have gotten much skill in this spiritual Art

Orat. l. 1. (...). Greg. Naz. Apolog.
King-craft, (if I may so term it*) and yet never beat their heads, or busied
their brains about it; never studied Euangelium Regni. Matthew. 4.13. and 24.14.
the Gospel of this Kingdom, the only Book out of which it may be learned.
Yea in this regard is this Spiritual Treasure rather like learning than
wealth; in that Pecunia veniet ultro, honor afferetur, gratia ac dignitas
fortasse ingerentur: virtus in te non incidet, ne levi quidem opera, aut parv^
labor cognoscitur. Sen. ep. 76.
worldly wealth and Honors may be had without labor or study by the donation
of others, or by succession and descent; this, Philosophia non est res
beneficiaria: non obvenit. Sen. epist. 90.
not so; each one must seek it for himself, and must seek and labor in it
himself, or else the seeking of others, and their endeavor for him, will stand
him in little stead.

It is a pithie speech, indeed, that Bernard has, and in his sense not
unsound. Speaking of those words of the Prophet, Lament. 3.25.
The Lord is good to him that trusts on him, and to the soul that seeks
him; Si tam bonus quaerenti, quid invenienti? (Quomodo idem in Cant. Si ta^
bonus sequentibus, quid consequentibus?) Sed in hoc mirum est, quod nemo te
quaerere valet nisi qui prius invenerit. Vis quaeri ut inveniaris: vis inveniri
ut amplius quaeraris. Bern. de dilig. Deo, cap. 3.
If God be so good, says he, to him that seeks him, what will he be to him
when he finds him? But a strange matter it is; That no man can seek God
before he have found him; nor can a man sin seeking of him, when he has once
found him. God will be sought, that he may be found of us; and he will be
found, that he may further be sought of us. Men cannot seek him, says he,
until they have found him: and certain it is that they have not yet found
him, that never sought him, or that do not still constantly and Psalm. 105.4.
continually seek him.

Yet for the better explaining of Bernards meaning in the words before recited,
and the assoiling of some scruple that thence might arise, as also for the
reconciling of some Luke 11.10. and 13.24.
speeches of our Savior, that may seem the one to cross the other: we must
understand, that Esai. 65.1.
there is never any seeking on our part, before some proffer on Gods part: for
Potes quaeri and inveniri: praeveniri non potes. Bern. de dilig. Deo, c. 3. Ad
bonum assurgere perfect non possumus, nisi nos spiritus and praeveniendo
excitet, and subsequendo confortet. Greg. in Ezech. 10. Nolentem praevenit ut
velit: volentem subsequitur, ne frustra velit, Aug. Enchir. cap. 32.
man can by no means prevent Gods work. Now to pass by those Romans 1.20. and
2.15.
common lights and helps of nature by God generally afforded unto all, of
which the Apostle Paul to Act. 17.27.
the Athenians, and Act. 14.17.
the Lycaonians in the Acts; because 1 Cor. 1.21. and 2.7, 8, 9.
they never prove effectual in this kind to any purpose ordinarily in any:
and to confine our selves to those aides that he offers and affords
usually in his Church; which alone in ordinary course are effectual to this
end: There is as a twofold vocation; so a twofold diquisition: As Vocatio
duplex; externa, interna: s^ve generalis and specialis: vel communis and
peculiaris* Vide Aug. de Corrept. and Great. c. 7. Drus Miscell. lib. 2. cap. 2.
and Calv. Institut. l. 3. c. 24.. 7.
a twofold vocation on Gods part; an external vocation, in the offer of the
means, which does not always take effect; of which our Savior, Matthew. 20.16.
and 22.14.
Many are called, but few chosen: and Quae and vocati^ secu^dum propositu^*
Romans 8.28. 2 Timothy 1.9.
an internal vocation, in the blessing accompanying those means, which cannot
be without effect; of which the Apostle, Romans 8.30.
Those that he calls, he justifies; and those that he justifies, he
glorifieth. So there is Disquisitio duplex.
a twofold diquisition or seeking on our part; an outward seeking (if I may so
term it) in the use of the means, the study of them, and pains taking
about them, which yet is not always effectual: For, Hosh. 5.6.
They shall go to seek the Lord with their sacrifices; but they shall not
find him, says the Prophet: And Luke 13.24.
Many shall seek to enter, but shall not be able, says our Savior. The
other inward, Ier. 24.7. and 30.21. and 31.18, 19. 1 Ioh. 5.20.
when those means by the gracious assistance of Gods Spirit, have wrought
thoroughly upon the heart: of which the Psalmist, Psalm. 119.2.
Blessed are they, that seek him with their whole heart: and God by the
Prophet, Ier. 29.13, 14.
They shall seek me, and find me; because they shall seek me with all their
heart. And this is that seeking that Bernard speaks of, which is ever
effectual; and of which our Savior therefore, Matthew. 7.7, 8. Luk^ 11.9, 10.
Whosoever seeks finds. For none so seek but such as by effectual
vocation are found of God before: none so seek, but such as by effectual
conversion (the inseparable effect and fruit of such vocation) have Ierem.
24.7. and 31.18.
returned unto God, and so found him in part already. But as none are called
ordinarily in the latter sort, but those that are called first in the former:
so none seek ordinarily in this latter sort, but those that have diligently
Prove. 2.3, 4, 5. and 4.19 10, 20. and 8.33, 34. Io^. 5.39. Luke 10.39, 42. Act.

sought first in the former: which seeking our Savior therefore inciteth
hereunto, and by which we may hope to attain to the latter, if we continue
constant therein, through Gods blessing thereupon. But without it there is no
hope ever to attain to it, or to find that, that in some sort may be John
7.34. Romans 9.31, 32.
sought and not found, but Psalm. 119.155.
cannot be found unless it be sought; and when it is once found, is so far
from causing men to give over their seeking, that it makes them, Sirac. 24.23,

But are they worth the seeking? may some man say. There are indeed some (...).

toylsome toys, hard to come by, but of no use or worth when a man has them:

either: And the very wealth, yea and the Latrunculis ludimus. Jn supervacuis

learning too of many consists much in such.

But these are not so: Answer.
The things here propounded as they are (...).

excellent. And therefore as they must be sought ere they can be had in
regard of their difficul^ie; Respect. 2.
so they may be sought that they may be had, in regard of the dignity, the
worth, the excellency of them; yea in regard of the use to, and the necessity
of them.

For first, here is a Crown, a Kingdom, Member 2. Object. Branch 1.
the highest pitch of ambitious men's aims. (...), Eteocles apud E^rip.

If for any thing a man should break his faith, it should be for a Crown, for
a Kingdom; says one. And the Devil hoped, if by any means, by the proffer
of Matthew. 4.8.
a Kingdom, to draw our Savior to his impious and devilish desires. If such
reckoning then be made of 1 Cor. 9.25.
a corruptible Crown, of Psalm. 68.33.
an earthly Kingdom, Dan. 5.21.

Kingdom, the Kingdom of God; of (...)* Heb. 12.^8.
a Kingdom, says the Apostle, that cannot be shaken, of ^sal. 45.6.
a Throne that stands firm and immovable forever?

Secondly, here is Righteousness, Ephesians. 4.24.
a principal part of Gods Image, Genesis 1.27. (...), Greg. Naz. i^ Matthew. 19.
Haec antecedit animalia; Deos sequitur, Sene^. epist. 76.
wherein Man at first was made: Branch 2.
that whereby man excels the beasts; Quic quid longa ser^^s, multis
laboribus, mul^a numinis indulgentia stru^it, ^d (...) dies spargit and
d^ssipat, Senec. e^ist. 91.
and that makes him 1 John 3.7. 1 Pet. 1.15, 16.
like God; yea without which man is not only no better, but far worse than a
beast; and whereby men do as far excel men, as men themselves do beasts.
For Ipsis best^is bestiali^r est hom^ ration^ (...), and ratione non (...),
Bernard. in Cantic. 35.
a man endued with reason, without this righteousness, that is, without
religion, is (not only as bad as, but) far worse than a b^ast. And Ratione
homines jum^ntis, religione homines hominibus antistant. Vltra homines prove^it
probitas sola, infra hominem detrudit improbitas, ^oct. Consol. lib. 4. Pros. ^.
Religion makes some men excel other some that want it, as much as reason
makes them excel brute beasts.

It was the saying of an Heathen Man, that Nihil est virtute formosius, ni^^l
pulchrius, (...), Cicer. de Not. De^r. lib. 1. and 2. and de Amic. Quae si

Moral virtue was so beautiful, that if it could be seen with bodily eyes,
it would make men to be wondrously enamoured with it. And yet was that, says
Lactantius, but a bare Vmbra quaedam and imago j^stitia, Lactant. Jnstitut. l.

of? Tanti Vitrum, qua^ti margaritum. Tertul. ad Martyr. Tanti vit^u^, qua^ti

If they made such account of their glassie bugle, says Jerome after
Tertullian, how ought this rich and precious Pearl of ours to be esteemed of?
This to that is as (...), Homer. Iliad. (...)* V^lius arge^tum est auro.

Gold to Brass, says Bernard; and a little of Melius est pallens aurum quam
fulgens aurichal^u^. Bern. in Cant. 61.
the palest and coursest Gold is far better than much of the finest and
brightest Brass.

But let us consider them a little severally.

In the First place then, here is

A Kingdom propounded to all Christ's followers anf favorites.

Seek Gods Kingdom, says our Savior.

Concerning which, Branch 1.
it shall not be amiss to enquire; Observe. 2.
1. What Kingdom this is; Points 3.
2. Wherein it consists; Point 1.
3. Why it is so termed.


The Kingdom then here spoken of, is not so much the Kingdom of God ^ver us,
as the Kingdom of God in us: not the Kingdom whereby Psalm. ^03.19. Luke 19
27.
he reigns over us; (and yet it is no small privilege and preeminence to be
subject and Psalm. 18. and 36. Title. (...), Man. Pal^ol. praecept. 7. Romans 1.1.

happy that were in Salomons service, then are they much more Psalm. 84.4, 13.
blessed that dwell in Gods house and court, that have dependence upon him:)
but the Kingdom whereby he reigns in us, and wherein we reign with him:
Luke 12.32.
It is your Fathers will, says our Savior, to give you a Kingdom. And, Apoc.
1.6. and 20.6.
He has made us Kings and Priests, and we shall reign with him Apoc. 22.5.
for ever. And, Apoc. 3.21.
To him that overcommeth I will give to sit on my Throne, as I overcame, and
sit on my Fathers Throne.

Now of this Kingdom there are two degrees.

Point 2. Degrees 2. Degree 1 Branch 1.
There is first Regnum gratiae.
a Kingdom of Grace; wherein Romans 5.21.
we reign here in grace by Christ, whereby we have power here;

our natural corruptions, our lusts and concupiscenses within us, our

16. Non eunt, sed feruntur, Sen. ep. 23. Turpe est autem non ire, sed ferri,
Ide^ ep. 37.
wherewith worldly men are led captive, enslaved and enthralled, and which Romans

He is a King that dreads naught; he is a King that covets and desires
nothing. And, Immane regnum est posse s^ne regno pati. Senec. Thyest. 3.1.
It is a wondrous great Kingdom for a man to be able to contemn a Crown, to
set light by a Kingdom, as Hebr. 11.24, 25, 26.
Moses did, that preferred afflictions with Gods people before it; to tread,
not the Earth only, but the very Apoc. 12.1.
Moon too, and all sublunarie things, as Philip. 3.8.
dross and Trash under his feet.

2. To prevail against, Branch 2.
and triumph over all the enemies and adversaries of our salvation without us,
and all such outward evils as they are able to raise up against us. To which
purpose it is that the Apostle having spoken before of persecutions the sword,
f^mine* and nakedness; Romans 8.35, 36, 37.
In all these things, says he, (...), Sicut Soph^^l. Elect. (...).
we are more than Conquerors, (What is that? even Triumphers.) through him
that has loved us. For, 2 Cor. 2.14.
God makes us always to (...), Theophyl. triumphat, i. tri^m^hare facit

He is a valiant Champion indeed, says Ignatius, who though he be beaten, and
receive many blows, yet will not give over till he have vanquished his
adversary. Apoc. 12.11.
They overcame him, says the Holy Ghost, Apoc. 13.7.
that warred upon them, and overcame them, by the blood of the L^m^e* (...) by
the word of the Testimony, and by not thinking much to lay down their lives
unto death; by setting light (as Act. ^0.24.
the Apostle of himself) by their lives. The Spirit of God may seem to
contradict himself when he says in the one place, Apoc. 13.7.
He made war upon the Saints and overcame them; and in the other again,
Apoc. 12 11.
They conquered and overcame him. But the one is spoken (...).
according to humane conceit, the other (...).
according to the truth of the thing. And certain it is, that as Gods Tunc
enim non ex malo uno, sed ex omn^bus simul and s^m^l liberantur, Aug. in Psalm.
34.17, 19. Ita liberantur, ut liberari amplius o^us non habeant, B^rn. in
Psalm. 91.15, 16.
Children are never better delivered out of their troubles, than when they
seem not to be delivered at all, when they are delivered out of them by death.
So (...), Oecum. in 2 Cor. 2. (...), Chrysostom. in Romans hom. 15.
they never more prevail against, and triumph over their adversaries, than
when those their adversaries outwardly seem most to prevail against, and to
triumph over them.

But because this their Psalm. 45.13.
Majesty is most inward, and 1 John 3.2.
the world cannot so well see it: there is secondly therefore Regnum gloriae.
a Kingdom of Glory, whereby those that Romans 5.21.
reign now in Grace by Christ, shall one day Romans 5.17.
reign in Glory with Christ. For, Coloss. 3.3, 4.
our life is now hidden with Christ in God; says the Apostle: But when Christ,
who is our Life shall appear, then shall we also appear in glory with him.
And, 1 John 3.2.
We shall at his appearing become like unt^ (...), Degree 2.
because we shall see him as he is. As Ephesians. 2.6.
We are now glorified in him, so 2 Thessalonians. 1.10.
he shall then be glorified in us; what time we shall hear from him that
blessed and joyful sound, Matthew. 25.34.
Come and receive the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.

Now further this Kingdom is called the Kingdom of God; Point 3. Reasons 4.
Reason 1. Reason 2. Reason 3. Reason 4.
1. Because Matthew. 20.23.
he has prepared it; 2. Because Luke 12.32.
he conferreth and bestows it; 3. Because Apoc. 4.10.
of and under him we hold it; 4. Because Apoc. 20.6.
with him we reign in it; for from him we receive it, and together with him
we reign in it.


Is it a Crown and a Kingdom then, and such a Crown and a Kingdom, Uses 4.
that our Savior here makes offer of?

This serves first, as to discover, Use 1. Reprehe^sion.
so to check and control the base-mindednesse of most men in the World: Who, as

they profess themselves to be, not to be Christians indeed and truth, though
they bear the name and title of such. For Christianity is a Kingdom. Use 2.

But are they so indeed? And are all Christians called to a Crown, Use 3.

to a Kingdom? Then let them learn hence how charily and warily it behooves
Christian men to walk of all others.

ones. It stood not with Themistocles his state to stoop down to take up of
the spoils, that the enemy had thrown from them in flight; but, (...), Plut.

many things may well beseem a worldly man, as Mat. 6.32.
to be greedy of the world, and to Phil. 3.19, 20.
mind earthly things, which will in no wise become a Christian.

Besides that, (...), Dion. Chry. orat. 1.

therefore are such worse, says Salvian, though they be no worse, than others,
because they ought to be better. Use 4. Exhortation.


Lastly, is it no less matter than a Kingdom, that we are here invited unto?
This may serve to incite us, if there be any mettle in us, to the diligent and
industrious seeking after it. Perp^ssi sunt exercitus in^piam rerum omnium,
vixerunt herbarum radicibus, and dictu foedis tulerunt famem. Haec omnia passi

Who would not put hard for it, to win a Crown, to gain a Kingdom? Here is
fit matter for our ambitious thoughts and desires to be working upon with
warrant. For, as Augustine observes, that there is a kind of lawful and
religious Qui vetat te esse foeneratorem, idem jussit te esse foeneratorem, et
dicitur tibi, Foenerare, Aug. in Psalm. 36.

kind of holy (...). Romans 15.20. 2 Cor. 5.9. 1 Thessalonians. 4.11.
Ambition, that our Savior Christ not allows only, but enciteth also, and
exhorts us hereunto. (...). 1 Cor. 12.31.
Affect, says the Apostle, the best, the chiefest things. And, Let even a
Kingdom at least, a Crown, and no less, says our Savior, be your aim. It
is enough for earthly Princes, their followers and favorites, if they can
attain to some Titles of inferior Honor, to be Dukes and Marquesses, or the
like. But if they begin once, Legatur Dio Cass. hist. lib. 57.
with Seianus, to have an eye or aim at a Crown, Nulla fides regni so^^j^,
omnisque potestas, Impatiens consortis erit, Lucan. lib. 1.
that will in no wise be endured in them. But it is not some Vsque ad regni
dimid um. Ester 7.2. Mark 6.23.
inferior Honor, some petie place in a kingdom, but the Crown and Kingdom
it self, that our Savior Christ here would have us shoot at, and seek after.
And who would not seek after a kingdom, if he had any hope to attain it? We
see upon what uncertain hopes ambitious persons in such cases lay Jmperia
pr^tio quolibet constant b^ne, Polyni^es apud Sen. Theb. 4.
all at the stake, and hazard loss, not of living only, but of life. And
certainly our Savior would never encite us to seek after it, if (...).
it were not to be had. Yea he gives us assurance, that if we seek seriously,
and so as we should, we shall find it. For Luke 11.10. Solus Deus nunquam
frustra quaeritur, etiam quum non invenitur, Bern* de Cons^d. l. 1.
Every one, says he, that so seeks, finds: he is as sure to find, as if
he had found already. 2 Timothy 1.17.
One siphorus sought me diligently, says the Apostle, and he found me: And so,
Prove. 8.17.
I love them that love me, says the Wisdom of God, that Apoc. 19 11.
has the disposing of this Crown, Apoc. 2.26. and 3.21.
of this Kingdom; and all those that seek me early, 1 Chronicles. 28.9.
shall be sure to find me. The Kingdom of this World, as the Aurum
quaesiturus es, and ^orte non inventurus: quisquis me quaerit, cum illo sum.
August. in 1 John 10.
Wealth of this World, may be sought, and not found; this Kingdom we shall
not miss of, if we seek it as we should. Amaturus es honore^, and ^ortasse
u^ perventurus. Qui^ me amavit, and n^^s ad me pervenit? Ib.
He that sincerely desires it, has in part attained it already.

But a Crown, a Kingdom? may some say. Objection.

Who would not have heaven and happiness? Who would not reign in heaven
eternally with God and Christ? Unless it be some wretched and accursed
Atheists, that think there is no such thing to be had.

Subjection.
Yea but there is somewhat more than so in it. Matthew. 19.28.
We must begin to reign here, if we mean to reign there. We must partake
with Christ here in the Romans 8.23.
first fruits of Grace, if we desire hereafter to partake with him in John
1.14, 16.
fullness of Glory.

Observe. 3*
There is no access to this Kingdom, but by Righteousness only.

Branch 2.
Seek Gods Kingdom and his Righteousness, says our Savior Christ here.
And, Romans 5.21.
That Grace may reign through Righteousness; says the Apostle elsewhere.

Questions 3.
Now concerning this Righteousness, three Questions would be discussed; 1. What
is meant by Righteousness here; 2. Why it is called the Righteousness of God;
3. Why no part in this Kingdom can be had without it.


Question 1.
There is therefore a twofold Righteousness; and every true Christian (it is
the constant Doctrine of all our Divines; and Legantur quae Mortonus noster
adducit ex scriptoribus Pontificijs, Apolog. Cath. par. 1. l. 1. c. 24.
our Adversaries wittingly wrong us, when they charge us with the contrary)
has his peculiar share in either. There is Iust^tia imputata, Romans 4.6.
a Righteousness imputed, and there is Iustitia impertita, Ephesians. 5.9.
a Righteousness imparted; the one Ierem. 23.6. and 33.16* Romans 10.4. 2 Cor.
5.21.
inherent in Christ, and imputed to us; the other 1 Cor. 1.30. Ephesians. 4.24.
imparted by Christ, and In nobis, non ex nobis, Aug. ep. 143.
inherent in us. For that Esai. 61.1.
spiritual Oil that was powered upon Christ our Head, and wherewith Psalm. 45.7.
God anointed him above all his fellows, when John 3.34.
the Spirit was given him beyond measure, like Psalm. 133.2.
the Ointment that was powered upon Aarons head, is shed forth and diffused in
some measure, more or less, unto every living member of his mystical Body.
John 1.16.
Of his fullness have we received all, even grace for grace. 1 Cor. 6.11.
The former is the Righteousness of Justification; the latter is the
Righteousness of Sanctification.

Some understand here the former: Answer.
I rather the latter.

1. Because the word is so taken every where else throughout this whole Sermon:
Reason 1.
as where it is said; Matthew. 5.6.
Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: And, Matthew. 5.10.
Blessed are they that suffer for righteousness sake: And, Matthew. 5.^0.
Unless your Righteousness go beyond the Righteousness of the Scribes and
the Pharisees, etc. Which very passage these words seem to have reference
unto.

2. Because it is that Righteousness that does properly, peculiarly, Reason 2.
and immediately make us actually Kings, and puts us in the actual 2 Pet.
1.4. Men's regnum bona possidet, Sen. Thy. 2.2. Qui recte faciet, no^ qui
dominatur, erit Rex. Auson. Monofyll.
possession of this Kingdom: the former meriteth it, this enters us into it:
the former purchases it for us; this prepares and fitteth us for it. Romans
4.5, 6, 7, 8.
Our justification acquiteth us of the guilt of sin: Romans 8.1, 2.
Our sanctification freeth us from the power of sin, Rom^ 6.8, 17, 14.
enabling us to quell it, to subdue it, to prevail against it, that ruled,
conquered, and kept us under before: and so causes us Apoc. 20.6.
to reign here as spiritual Kings over it: yea Ezekiel. 36.25. Ephesians. 5.26.
it cleanses us also of the soil and filth of sin, and so by eating our
corruption out of us by degrees, it prepares and fitteth us for that Kingdom
to come, 1 Cor. 15.50.
which flesh and blood cannot enter, nor corruption inherit. But whether of the
two be here meant, is not greatly material; since that 1 Cor. 6.11. and 1.30.
Romans 8.29, 30.
they never are severed the one from the other: And where the one therefore is
expressed, there the other ever is implied.

Question 2. Answer. General.
Now this Righteousness is here called the Righteousness of God;

Generally, in opposition to Luke 18.9.
that counterfeit Righteousness that the Scribes and Pharisees so much bragged
of, and gloried so much in; and which our Savior had discovered, taxed, and
rejected before Chap. 5.20.
in this Sermon.

Answer. Particular. Reason 1.
More particularly, in diverse respects:

1. Because it is given of God. For, (...). Nullum bonum, quod non a summo
bono, Aug. de diverse. 3.
All good is of God. And, (...), P^ndar. Olymp. 9. Nemo absque numine aut est,
aut fuit bonus. Bonus vir sine Deo non est, Sen. ep. 41. Nulla sine Deo (...)
est, Idem ep. 73.
No man ever was or is good without God. Job. 3.27.
No man can have ought, says S. John the Baptist, unless it be given him from
above. And, Iam. 1.17. (...)^ Marc. de L^g. Sp^^. p. ^0.
Every good gift, says S. James, is from above, and comes down from the
Father of lights. As Matthew. 19.17.
none is originally and essentially good but God: so no man is in any kind or
degree good without God. Nemo bon^^, qui non ex mal^ bo^^s, Aug. in Prosper.
Sent. 155.
There is no man good, says Augustine, but that of (...), is by God made good.
And, Qui n^mine^ bonum ^^venit, nemin^m salvat, nisi que^ praevenit, Bern. de
Great. and lib. Arb.
He, says Bernard, that Psalm. 14.2, 3.
finds no man good, saves none but such as by preventing grace he makes
good.

2. Because it is approved of by God* Reason 2.
which that other of theirs is not. It is said of Zachary and Elizabeth, that
they were Luke 1.6.
just in Gods sight. Whereupon says Ambrose, Multi hominibus justi videntur,
pauci Deo. Aliter enim hominibus and aliter Deo. Hominibus sec. externam
specie^ and fac^^m: Deo sec. internam veritate^ and virtutem, Ambr. in Luc.
It is one thing to be just in man's sight, and another thing to be just in Gods
sight, An outward show and semblance, is enough for the one: but inward power
and truth is required unto the other. And Luke 16.15. Mat. 23.27, 28.
that that makes a glorious show in the eyes of man, is most abominable many
times in the sight of God; Aurum hominibus, l^tu^ Deo. Greg. Mor. l. 34. c. 13.
Gold in man's eyes, dirt in Gods sight; says Gregory.

3. Because it is conformable to the Law of God; It makes us 1 Ioh. 3.4, 6, 9,
10, 24. and 5.2, 3. Romans 7.25.
conformable to it in part here for the present, Reason 3.
and it will make us Eph^s. 5.27.
fully and perfectly conformable to it hereafter. Whereas that other of theirs
does nothing less. Tota vita infidelium peccatum est. Et nihil est bonum
absque summo bono, Aug. in Sent. Prosper. 81.
The whole Life of such, says Augustine, is nothing but sin: and their best
actions, no better than Splendida peccata: Et vitia potius qua^ virtutes, Idem
de Civit. l. 19. c. 25. Sine Christo siquidem omnis virtus in vitio est, Hier.
in Gal. 3. Incassumque quis laborat in acquisitione virtutum, si aliunde eas

nisi semine verae Exoritu^ fidei, peccatum est, inquereatum Vertitu^: and
sterilis cumulat sibi gloria poenam, Prosper. de Ingrat.
glittering corruptions.

4. Because it is and shall be rewarded of God. The Crown expected is called 2 Timothy 4.8.
the Crown of Righteousness. And, Romans 2.7.
To those, Reason 4.
says the Apostle, that by well-doing, and continuance therein, seek glory,
and honor, and immortality, will God give eternal life in that day. And,
Matthew. 6.6.
Thy Father, says our Savior, that sees thee in secret, will reward thee
openly. Yea there is Mat. 25.34, 35, 40. Luke 14.9.
no action so mean or slight proceeding from this, even to Matthew. 10.42. Mark^
9.41.
the gift of a Cup of cold water, that shall pass unregarded, or unrewarded
with God. Whereas that other Righteousness of theirs has no reward promised
it. Matthew. 6.2.
Verily I say unto you, says our Savior, not barely, (...).
they have, but they (...). Quod Theophylact^s observavit.
have all, their reward: they have Matt. 23.5, 6* 7.
all they desire, and all they deserve, and all that ever they are like to
have: they may make their (...). Quo mod^ Paulus Phil. 4.18. (...). De quo
argutius Paulo D^naeus noster ad Chrysostomum Savilianum.
acquittance; for such kind and manner of discharge does our Savior there
allude unto.

But why may a man without this Righteousness have no part in Gods Kingdom?
Quest. 3.


Answer.
For dive^^ ^auses and reasons;

These among many others:

Reason 1.
1. Because the Chief Commander in this Kingdom, is Hebr. 7.2. (...) ( ex
Hebr. (...) Genesis 14.18.) (...). Frustra ergo est author Etymologici, qui (...),
inquit, (...). Imo (...) ad quod Salem alludit, est (...), uti and Apostolus,
ibidem, Etymologico ducente alucinatus est and Meurs. animadv. Miscell. lib. 1.
cap. 11.
a King of Righteousness. The Scepter of this Kingdom is* Psalm. 45.6.
a Rod of Righteousness. The Throne of this Kingdom is Psalm. 9.5. and 97.2.
a Seat of Righteousness: And the Kingdom it self is Romans 14.17.
a Kingdom of Righteousness: And, 1 Cor. 6.8.
No unrighteous therefore can inherit this Kingdom; that has nothing at all
but Righteous in it. Esai. 60.21.
The people of it, says the Prophet, are all Righteous.

2. Because Romans 5.17. Apoc. 20.6.
none but those that have part here in the Kingdom of Grace, Reason 2.
may hereafter partake in the Kingdom of Glory. But by Righteousness we
become members of the Kingdom of Grace. Romans 5.21.
That Grace, says the Apostle, may reign through Righteousness. None but
such therefore have any part in the one; none but such shall ever have share in
the other.

3. Because this Righteousness is the Royal Roabe. Psalm. 132.9.
Let thy Priests, says the Psalmist, Reason 3.
(and the same Persons here are both 1 Pet. 2.9. Apoc. 1.6. and 5.10. and 20.6.
Kings and Priests) be clothed with Righteousness. And, Isai. 61.10.
He has clad me with the Robe of Righteousness. And, Apoc. 19.8.
To the Bride it was given to be arrayed in fine Silk: and (...).
the fine Silk is the Righteousness of the Saints. As no man then might come
into the Wedding-house Mat. 22.11, 12.
without the Wedding Garment; so may no man enter into this Kingdom without
this Royal Robe. Hebr. 12.14.
Without Holiness, says the Apostle, shall no man ever see God. And Psalm.
132.9, 16.
those alone that are clothed with Righteousness here, shall be clothed
everlastingly with Salvation hereafter.

4. Because Apoc. 21.27.
No unclean thing can come within the walls and compass of this Kingdom:
Reason 4.
nay, Esai. 35.8.
no unclean person can set foot into the Way that leads to it. But this
Righteousness, and this alone is that, that can truly and thoroughly cleanse,
purge, and purify us, and that not Psalm. 24.3, 4. 1 Timothy 2.8.
our hands only, but our Matthew. 5.8. Act. 15.9.
hearts too; as well the Romans 7.22. 2 Cor. 4.16.
inward man, as the outward; as well 2 Cor. 7.1. Ephesians. 4.23.
the Spirit as the Flesh. Whereas that other Righteousness Matthew. 23.25. Luke
11.39.
cleanses the outside only, but leaves the inside as foul still as ever it
was. And therefore no marvel if our Savior tell us, That Matthew. 6.20.
unless our Righteousness exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and the
Pharisees, we shall never get into the Kingdom of God.

Use 3. Use 1. Information.
First then, do we desire to have part in this Kingdom?

Are we ambitious of a Crown? and that such a Crown, as is not Inest imperio

a Crown of thorns or thistles, but such a one as may c^re and rid our heads
of all carking care? as hereafter we shall see. Learn we here the way to it.
The Way to this Crown, to this Kingdom, is by Righteousness. Seek ye,
says our Savior, the Righteousness of God; and that will bring you to the
Kingdom of God. For, Romans 14.17.
The Kingdom of God is Righteousness. This Kingdom of God is not like the
Kingdoms of this World: that are Scelere part; s^^iere r^tenta: De quibus
Sen. The^. 4. -- regna cu^ scelere omnibus sunt exi^ijs graviora. --

unrighteousness often reigns. There is no way to rise in this Kingdom, there
is no way to attain to this Kingdom, but by Righteousness. Prove. 21.21.
He that follows Righteousness and mercy, shall find Righteousness, and
Life, and Glory; says Sal^mon. For it is the ^ust, says the Psalmist, that
Psalm. 11.5*7.
God loves and regards, that Psalm. 5.12.
he gardeth and protecteth, that Psalm. 17.15.
shall behold his face, that shall Psalm. 140.13.
dwell ever in his house; and that Matthew. 13.43.
shall shine as the Sun, says ou^ Savior, in the Kingdom of God their
Father Dan. 12.3.
for ever and ever.

Secondly, Use 2. Eviction.
observe we hence how cross and averse the corrupt heart of man is naturally
to all goodness and godliness; that, though a Crown, a Kingdom, an
incorruptible Crown, an everlasting Kingdom be propounded to this
Righteousness, and annexed unto it, yet will rather lose this Crown, rather
leave and forgo this Kingdom, than condescend to accept of it upon such a
condition; At ^aris ut vivat regnetque ben^us, Cog^ posse ^egat* Horat. epist.
^.
will not be constrai^ed to live happily, and to reign everlastingly, unless
he may do so upon some other terms* will choose rather not to reign, than to
be righteous. If this Crown indeed might be compassed by fraud and deceit, or
by oppression and extortion; not a few would be sure to have a share in it,
that are now never like to have any interest therein. Or if it might be held
with looseness and lewdness of life, we should not need much Rhetoric to
persuade many to accept of it. It is (...), Plut. ad (...)* indoct. (...)
potentiae suae magnitudinem metiuntur, Vell. hist. l. 2. Idque esse regni
maximu^ pignus putant. Si quicquid alijs (...), Sen. ^gam. 2.2. (...) qu^^^ibet
(...), ill esse Regem esse, (...) Hoc principat^s (...) putant, (...). hist. 1.
one maine end, for which many men desire authority and greatness, that they
may thereby gain liberty to live and do as they list; Sceptoru^ vis tota
perit, si pe^dere justa Incipit. -- Luca^. l. 8. Vbicu^que tantum honesta
dominanti licent, Precario regnatur. -- Atreus, Sen. Thyest. 1.2.
and without which they esteem power and authority naught worth. When Matthew.
3.1, 2.
John the Baptist preached the Gospel of this Kingdom, Mark 6.20.
Herod would willingly have had it, if he might have held his Herodias, his
Harlot with it. When Matthew. 4.23. Mark 1.14.
our Savior Christ published it, John 12.42, 43, and 3 1.
the Pharisees would feign have had it, if with their Matthew. 23.6, 7. John 5.44.
pride, Luke 16.14,
covetousness, and Luke 12.1.
hypocrisy, it might have been had and held; or if such Matthew. 5.20. Luke
18.9.
a specious show of Righteousness would have served the turn for it, as they
dazzled the eyes of the simpler sort with. But when this Matthew. 5.20. and 7.13.
Righteousness of God, this strictness of life, comes to be propounded
together with it, and to be exacted of all those that will have any share in
it; now Mark 6.17, 18.
Herod flies off, and will none of it, Luke 7.30.
the Pharisees keep aloof off, and reject it; and every natural man's
perverse heart thinks it held at too high a rate, if Mica 6.6, 7, 8.
without change of his corrupt course of life it cannot be compassed.

Use 3. Exclusion.
Thirdly, this serves to exclude many from it, that would yet seem to have,
yea and persuade themselves, that they have a good share in it. They have no
share in the former, because they have no part in the latter: They have no part
in the Kingdom propounded by Christ, because no part in the Righteousness
annexed unto it; because they remain still as they were naturally, 1 Cor.
15.32, 33, 34. 2 Cor. 12.21. Tit. 1.10, 12, 15, ^6.
unrenewed, unsanctified, unholy, unrighteous, wholly impure and profane both
in heart and in life; or if they have some show of holiness, it is 2 Timothy 3.2,
3, 4, 5.
in outward semblance only, there is no inward substance or power of it. Such
they are; and Psalm. 58.3, 4, 5. and 36.1, 2, 3. Ier. 9.2, 3, 5, 6.
other they refuse to be. They like well of this Kingdom; but they cannot away
with the Righteousness: Number. 23.10.
They are desirous to reign; but unwilling to be righteous. Jmpius and foelix
sic simul esse cupit, Vt nolit pius esse, velit tame^ esse beatus. De Macrin^
nescio quis apud Iul. Capitolin.
Happy they would be; but holy they will not be. And yet they hope, they say, to
do as well as the best. A thing that Quod natura negat, nec ratio patitur,
Ibid.
neither Religion, nor natural Reason admits. For God has lincked these two
together with an indissoluble bond, Apoc. 20.6. (...). Bonus beatus omnis, et
malus miser, Socrat. Plato. Greg. and Cic. Tucs. l. 5.
Happiness and Holiness, Reigning and Righteousness; the one as the Crown,
the other as the Robe, which cannot be had or worn therefore the one without
the other. And Matthew. 19.6.
what God has conjoined, man, do he what he can, shall never be able to
dis-joyne, and to sever. Whosoever refuses Romans 8.12, 13. Gal. 6.7, 8, 9.
Vivite itaque been, ne moriamini male, August. de verb. Dom. 24. Id age ut
bonam vitam habeas, and quacunque occasion a vita exieris, ad requiem, ad
beatitudine maeternam exibis: merces enim vitae bonae, ^terna est. Idem

to live as a Saint with Christ here on earth, shall never reign as a Saint
with him hereafter in heaven.

we be not so for the present, yet intend we, and purpose one day to be such;
we hope to be so ere we die, when we lie a dying at least. As there is no
wretched miser almost, no miserable worldling, no griping cormorant, no filthy
leacher, no debauched hell-hound, unless he be Ierem. 2.25.
desperately bent to destroy his soul, and be wholly given up unto Romans 1.28.
a reprobate sense, and to Ephesians. 4.19.
a senseless estate, but will say, that he means yet one day to do
otherwise; Ier. 8.5, 6.
he goes far, they say, that never turns; and he hops he shall have time
enough so to do ere he die. But they must follow the world, or their own lusts
first a while, and then they will take time at last to look after these things.

Subjection. Member 3. Order.
To meet with this slight that Satan is wont to suggest, thereby to cheat men of
their souls, our Savior here admonishes us to seek Gods Kingdom and his
Righteousness, not in the last, but Sive aliquid habes; o jam* philosophare.
Sive nihil, hoc prius q^aere qua^ quidqua^, Sen. ep. 17
in the first place.

Spiritual things as they must be sought, so they must be sought in the first
place:

Observe. 4.
(...), Nigrinus apud Lucianu^.
They must be sought instantly, without longer delay; Ab hoc incipiendum est.
Nihil prius quam hoc parandu^ est. Quid tu differs and post ^aetera paras? Sen.
epist. 17.
they must be sought first, Prou. 4.5, 7.
before and above all other things. Seek ye first Gods Kingdom, and his
Righteousness, says our Savior. And, Prove. 8.17.
He that seeks me early, says Gods Wisdom by Solomon, shall find me.

Reasons 8.
And great reason there is, why it should so be.

Reason 1.
For first, Merito poscit studia majora pars melior, Euc^^r. ad Va^^r. Prior
pars (...). Vt qu^ (...) prior est, non ^it con^ideratione post^ri^r, Ibidem.
The better part justly claims the principal care, and to be provided for in
the first place. Other things concern our bodies; these our soul and its
welfare. And as our Savior says, Matthew. 6.^5. Luke 12.^^.
The Body is better than raiment: so (...), Plut. cont. Epic. (...), Idem de
Tranq. (...), Aristot. Polit. l. 7. c. 1. Nostri melior pars animus est, Sen.
quaest. Not. (...). Greg. Naz. ad Cledon. 1. (...), Idem de Nupt. (...), Post
Euripid. Ide^ in I^^. 1. (...), Idem Apolog.
the Soul is better than the Body. Besides that, The Soul may do well
without the Body; but the Body cannot do well without the Soul. Our (...),
Chrysostom. tom. 8. ser. 17. Pr^^^ animi bona, Iu^en. Sat. 8.
first and principal care therefore should be for our soul, and those things
that concern it; and for these therefore in the first place, because they
principally concern it.

Secondly, Aeterna momentaneis praef^ren^^^ (...).
Things eternal should be preferred before things temporal. 2 Cor. 4.1^.
While we look, Reason 2.
says the Apostle, not on the things that are seen, but on the things that
are not seen. For the things that are seen, are temporal; but the things
that are not seen, are eternal. And, John 6.27.
Labor, says our Savior, not for the meat that perishes, but for (...),
Plut.
the meat that endures unto life eternal. But (...), Euripid. M^^talium
m^rtalis est foelicitas. Mortal^ est omn^ mortali^m* bonum. Metrodorus d^ ^is
loquit^r bo^^ ad qu^ concurritur, Sen. epist. 98.
all other things are temporal and transitory; Certum est sempiter^^mque
virtu^ bon^^. Hoc unum contingit immortale mortalibus, Sen. epist. ^^.
these only that our Savior enciteth hereunto, are eternal. And what
comparison then between the one and the other?

Thirdly, Supe^^ac^^ n^cessarijs pos^ponend^ s^nt, Sen. epist. 49. and 109.
Things necessary ought to be preferred to the first place. Reason 3.
But these are the only necessary things. Vnicum nec^ssarium, Luke 10.42.
There is but one thing necessary; says our Savior to Martha. Which Psalm.
27.4. (...), Chrysostom. tom. 8. S^r. 17.
one thing therefore only David desired; and Paul made his Phil. 3.12, 13.
maine aim, counting all but as dross and trash unto it: to wit, this
Kingdom, and the Righteousness of it. The old Proverb here holds, Aut
Caesar, aut nullus, (...), Gregor. Naz. in Pentecost. Omnis homo aut est cum
Christo regnaturus, aut cu^ diabolo cruciandus, Aug. de Temp. 85.
Either a King, or a Caitiffe. The greatest King in the world, if he miss of
this Kingdom, is as miserable a wretch as may be.

Fourthly, Indignum est dare Deo, quod dedignatur homo, Hier. in Malac. 1.
Great. Decret. Did. 49., c. 3.
It is a most unworthy thing to deal so with God, Reason 4.
as no man would endure to be dealt with. We will serve God, forsooth: but
when? when we are now good for naught. When we have served our selves of the
world, and satisfied our own lusts, are glutted with the one, and have
surfetted of the other, and are unfit and unable any longer to follow either;
-- Postquam lapidosa cheragra Fregere articulos, veteris ramalia fagi, Pers.
Sat. 5. Cum omnibus me^bris extorti and fracti, ne in lectulo quidem queant
nisi ab alijs moveri; uti de Domitio Tullo, Plin. epist. 18. lib. 8.
when we are scarce able to turn our withered bodies, and wearied bones in our
bed, then will we offer and tender our service to God. Malac. 1.8. Non pudet
te reliquias vitae tibi reservare, and id solum tempus bonae menti destinare,
quod in nullam rem conferri possit? Sen. de Brev. Vit. c. 4.
Offer it to thy Prince, says the Prophet; and see if he will accept of it.
Yea make proffer of thy self then, say I, to any mean man. And it is an
unworthy usage of God, for a man to offer that unto God, that any man would
think scorn of.

Fifthly, Non omnis ^^as ad perdiscendum sat est. Plaut. Truc. 1.1. Nullum non
ta^ magnis re^us te^pus a^gustu^ est, Sen. q. Not. l. 3. Non cu^ vacaveris,

terminos vita prote^ditur, Ide^ ep. 72.
All man's life is little enough, were it never so long, as for the learning, so
for the attaining of these things. Reason 5.
And (...); Epicu^. Stob. c. 16. Nihil in diem, nihil in horam permittitur,
Sen. ad Marc. c. 10. Nihil ne in totum quidem diem certum est, Idem ad Poly^.
c. 29*
we have no surety of any time, no not of an hour. Psalm. 31.15.
My times, says David, are in thine hands. Our times are in Gods hands, who
Qui promisit p^nitenti veniam, no^ promisit poenitendi horam. Qui poenitenti
misericordiam promisit, peccanti crastinum non promisit. Aug de verb. Dom. 59.
and homil. 11. and 13. and in Sent. Prosp. 72.
as he has promised pardon, says Augustine, upon our repentance, so he has
not promised us, so much as an hour for repentance. And when Apoc. 2.21, 22.
he has given men space, but they have no grace to turn, it is a just thing
with him Apoc. 10.6, 7.
to deny them further time for turning. Maximum been vivendi impedime^tum est
expectatio, quae pendet ex cras^ino. Perdis hodiernum: quod in man^^ alterius
positum est disponis; quod in tua dimittis, Sen. de brevit. vit. c. 9.
It is a fond thing therefore to let go and lose the time that we have, in
hope of, and building upon that that we may never have; to let that go that
is in our own hand, relying upon that that is in another hand. Reason 6.


Sixthly, Durus valde, imo potius, quod molestius est, valde mollis capitur,
consuetudine mala and diutina fractus, qui vitij^ simul and emarc^^t and
induruit, Sen. ep. 112.
The longer we defer it, the more unfit shall we find our selves for it. Qui
non est hodie cras minus aptus erit, Ovid. Remed. l. 1.
He that is not fit for it to day, will be more unfit for it to morrow.

no blessing there, where Peace and Unity is not. So that there is nothing
more delightful, more behoovefull than Peace. In regard whereof, it is that
the Apostle Paul so often, and so instantly enciteth unto it. Ephesians. 4*1. -- 6.
I therefore Paul, the Lords Prisoner, beseech you, that you would walk worthy
of the Calling whereunto you are called; with all humbleness of mind, and
meekness, with long suffering, supporting one another through Love;

if Peace be not joined with Piety, better no Peace than such Peace; Sine

if agreement be not joined with justice and equity, better no agreement at
all than such. As it is Conciliabulum, sive Conventiculu^, non Concilium.
no Council, but a Conventicle, wherein Truth is not aimed at: so it is (...),
Act. 23.13. (...), Chrysostom. in Matthew. hom. 35.

others; (...), Chrysostom. in Mat. 35. Pax cum bello sub Sylla de crudelitate

such agreement and concord is worse than any discord or disagreement
whatsoever. And Vt pernitiosum est, si unitas desit bonis: ita perniciosius

the more strongly men in such case are united together, the worse they are,
the more evil they may do; yea the worse it is for themselves too. For the
more they are united and conjoined either with other, the more are they
dis-united and dis-joined from God.

But to leave this Digression, though not altogether impertinent, which I was
that morning admonished, that somewhat of this Argument was of course by the
Doners desire required and expected.
the present Occasion in part required of me; and to return to the maine Point
that we are principally to pursue.

Therefore, lastly, are Gods Kingdom and his Righteousness first to be
sought, Reason 8.
because

The seeking thereof will be the most Compendious Course for the Compassing of
our own Desires.

For why do men neglect to look after Gods Kingdom? Moratur me res
familiaris. Sic illam disponere volo, ut sufficere mihi hoc agenti possit, ne
aut paupertas mihi oneri sit, aut ego alicui. Quantu^ sat est, no^dum habeo. Si

Forsooth, because they must build their houses, they must feather their nestes
first: they must get something that may be a stay to them hereafter, that they
may be able to defend the world withal. To remove therefore this rub,

Amph. 2.5. Est tanti laborare, omnia bona semel occupature, Senec. epist. 76.
This one thing will bring all with it, it will help us to all things, Observe.

that our heart can desire. Psalm. 37.3, 4.
Trust in the Lord, says the Psalmist, and do good, and thou shall assuredly
be ^ed. Delight thy self in the Lord, and he will give thee thine ^wne hearts
desire. Psalm. 84.11.
He will be Deus Sol et Sc^tum, debit grati^^ and gloriam.
thy Sun and thy Shield; he will give thee grace and glory: and he will deny
thee no good thing, so long as thou leadest a godly life. As 1 King. 3.9 -- 13.
2 Chronicles. 1.11, 12.
when Solomon asked Wisdom, it pleased God so well, that he gave him Wealth
and Honor together with it; so upon the seeking hereof, we shall not only
find it, but we shall have all other good things cast in upon us together with
it.

Nor indeed can it be otherwise. Reasons 4. Reason 1.


For first, we shall have thereupon our right to all things restored us in
Christ. 1 Cor. 3.22, 23.
All things, says the Apostle, whether present, or future, this world or the
next, all things, I say, are yours; and you Christ's; and Christ Gods. As Hebr.
1.2.
Christ, so all Christians are Gal. 3.26. Romans 8.17.
in Christ Apoc. 21.7.
Heirs of all things. And for Aud^cter Deum roges, nihil illum de alieno
rogaturus, Sen ep^st. 10.
God therefore to deny them ought, were to deny them of their own.

Secondly, they that thus do, Reason 2.
are John 1.12. Gal. 3.26. 2 Cor. 6.17, 18.
Gods Children in Christ; and John 14.13. and 16.23. 1 John 5.14, 15.
may have for the asking what they will at Gods hands. For, Matthew. 7.11.
If you that are evil, says our Savior, use to give good things to your
Children; how much more will your heavenly Father give you good things, if you
ask him? Psalm. 147.9. Mat. 6.26. (...); etc. Epictet. Ari^^. Dissert. l. 3. c.
26.
He seedeth the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the field: and he that
is careful to provide for his hounds and his hawks, will he suffer his
Children to beg and starve, that must one day be his heirs?

Reason 3.
Thirdly, he has prepared a Crown, a Kingdom for them. Luke 12.32.
Fear not, little flock, says our Savior; it is your Fathers will to bestow
a Kingdom upon you. And, Qui dabit regnu^, non dabit viaticu^? Aug. de verb.
Dom. (...), Chrysostom. in Matthew. 22.
will he deny them a Crum, that will give them a Crown? Will he deny them a
bit of bread, or a cup of drink, ( 1 Chronicles. 29.11, 12.
all the wealth in the world is no more with him; he can as easily give the one
as the other) that purposes one day to make them Kings.

Reason 4.
Yea lastly, he has bestowed his own, his only Son on them. John 3.16.
He so loved them, that he gave his only begotten Son for them. And, Romans
8.32. (...), Chrysostom. in Romans hom. 15.
He that spared not his own Son, but gave him up to death for them, how can
he but give them all things together with him? Qui misit unigenitum, immisit
sp^ritu^, promisit vultum, quid tandem tibi negaturus est? Bern. de Temp. Nihil
ei negaturus creditur, quem ad esum vituli hortatur, Hieron. de Fill. Prodig.
He that 1 John 4.9, 10.
sent his Son to die for them, has Galat. 4.6.
put his Spirit in them, and has Matthew. 5.8.
promised them the fruition of his blessed presence for ever; how can he
refuse to provide for them, and confer upon them whatsoever good thing they
shall stand in need of, while they live here?

Uses 4. Use 1. Admonition.
Now this first serves to admonish all Christian men, yea all men in general,
both what they should first and most, and what they should last and least care
for. Optimum est curam principalem anima impendere. Eucher. ad Valor. Vt primas
apud nos curas, quae prima habentur, obti^^ant: summasque sibi sol^citudinis
parts, qu^ summa est, salus vendicet. Omnia vincat eo studio, quo praecedit
omnia, Ibidem.
Their first and principal care should be for the principal things, that is,
for spiritual things, for Gods Kingdom and his Righteousness, for
sanctification and true holiness. Quis extruendi, nisi cum fundamenta jeceris,
locus est? Superaedificare caeteras utilitates destinanti salus fundamentum
est. Caeteru^ quomodo quispiam sequentia addat, si nec prima possederit? Ide^
ibid.
These are the things that most nearly concern them; and without which they
can have no benefit of ought else. And these are the things that God would have
them most to look after: As for other things, when we have so done, he would
have us leave the care of them wholly to him. Psalm. 55.22.
Roll thy burden upon the Lord, says the Psalmist, and he will maintain thee.
1 Pet. 4.4.
Cast all your care upon him, says S. Peter; for he takes care for you. And,
Philip. 4.6.
Take you no thought for ought, says S. Paul: but let al your wa^ts be made
known unto God by prayer. He Matthew. 6.32.
knows what is fit for you, and he will supply you. What a deal of trouble,
and distraction might we free our selves of? How great quietness and sweet
tranquillity of mind might we procure to our selves, if we could do thus?

But alas how contrarily (and let that be the next Use) are most men affected
to that that God would here have? Use 2. Reprehe^sion.


God would have men take care for spiritual things, Error 1.
and leave the care of temporal things wholly to him. Whereas most men take a
clean contrary course. (...), Chrysostom. in Matthew. 22.
All the care they take is for temporal things, and as for spiritual things,
they say, they will leave all to Gods mercy: They will take to themselves Gods
part, and they will leave God their part. What he would do himself, they will
do; and what he would have them do, that they put off and refer wholly to
him. Temporal things they will be sure to look for, they will not trust God
with them: But for spiritual things if they will not be found without seeking,
for their parts they are never like to be sought after.

Error. 2.
Again, Spiritual things God would have to be esteemed as the (...).

reckoned of as (...), Chrysostom. in hunc locum.

generally take a direct contrary course. They (...), Lucian. Terpsion.
set the cart, as we say, before the horse. They Si caro famula anima domina,

Take most pains in that, that God would have them to take least in; and take
least pains in that, that God would have them to take most in. First Gods
Kingdom and his Righteousness, says Christ, and then Riches or those other
things, Verse. (...) cives, cives, quaerenda pecunia primum est. Virtus post

once furnished of the former.

Yea Gods Children themselves are oft-times too much faulty in this kind: Too
slack and (...) in seeking after the best things; and ^ore careful tha^ they
should be, for the things of this life. Not so diligent in attending as they
should be, with Mary, that Vnicum necessarium, Luke 10.42.

troubled about many things, and those many times such as they might very well
be without; much perplexed and distracted with care and thought about
provisions for the body, for the back and the belly, for meat, drink and
apparel; (that which our Savior here Mat. 6.25, 28, 31. Luke 1^.22, 29.
had reproved in his followers before) as if either they wanted Matthew. 6.26.
a Father to provide for them, or Matthew. 6.32. Luke 12.30.
their Father were ignorant of their wants. Perkins alicubi.
If we see a young man grow worldly, full of care and thought for the world;
we are ready to say, Sure his Father is deceased, and his Friends gone; he
has lost those that should look after him; he has no body left to take care
for him but himself; else (...). Aristot. Rhetor. l. 2. c. 12.
he would never sure be so worldly, so full of care as he is. But our heavenly
Father is not dead: (he 1 Timothy 6.17. Apoc. 15.7.
lives for ever to do for us:) nor does or can Esaias. 49.15.
his care die for them, whom he has once vouchsafed to undertake the care of.
And it is a great wrong therefore, that Christian men offer to this their
careful and provident Father, when they are so full of care themselves.

But does no care at all then bec^me Christians* Question.
may some man say. Or is all Care utterly condemned? Should Christian men be
like those of Judge 18.27.
Laish, a sort of careless people; to live looking after nothing, but Qui
finxit alas papilioni, is curabit omnia. Luxurioso^^^ (...). Sc^lig. de Subtle.
put off all to Gods providence, and so let things go at six and sevens, as we
say?

Answer.
Not so neither. We must wisely distinguish here, that we neither wheel into
the whirle-pit of distrustfulnesse on the one hand, nor wrecke our selves
against the rock of retchlesnesse on the other. There is a twofold care, yea
or carfulness, if you will: there is Solicitudo dilige^tiae, (...).
a carfulness of diligence; and there is Solicitudo diffidentiae, (...).
a carfulness of diffidence: the one is approved and commended; the other is
disallowed and condemned: we are Prove. 27.23. and 22.29. Phil. 4.8, 9. 1 Timothy
5.4, 8.
enjoined the one; we are Philip. 4.6. 1 Timothy 6.8, 17.
inhibited the other; nor does the one necessarily follow the other, or the
expulsion of the one exclude also the other. Conceive it by a plain and
familiar instance. A Father places his Son in a Farm, furnishes him with a
stock, bids him play the good husband; and further assures him, to put him
out of all fear, that, if things fall out otherwise than well, so that it be
not by his own wilful neglect or default, he will supply him and set him up
again. The Son in such case, though he may well be the less distrustful,
yet ought not to be the less diligent, for this his Fathers kind offer, and
the assurance given him of such supplies. Nor ought Christian men therefore to
be the less careful of Prove. 6.6, 7, 8. et 12.11. et 28.19.
walking diligently and industriously in those places and callings whereunto
God has assigned them, or in following the affairs and doing the duties that
do thereunto appertain. (They 2 Thessalonians. 3.6, 11.
walk inordinately, says the Apostle, that 1 Thessalonians. 4.11.
follow not their own work, and as well 2 Thessalonians. 3.10.
earne, if they be able, as 2 Thessalonians. 3.1^.
eat their own bread;) because God has graciously promised, and undertaken to
provide for them. (...), Phil. 3.16.
Walk they must each one carefully 1 Cor. 7.20, 24.
within the compass of his calling, and expect Deuteronomy. 28.8. Psalm. 128.1, 2.
Gods blessing upon their labors and endeavors. But for the issue and event of
them, they must not be troubled and distracted about it; but Psalm. 37.5. 2 Samuel 10.12.
leave that all to God, Hebr. 13.5, 6.
assuring themselves that he will not see them to want, howsoever things fall
out, but will furnish them ever with what is fit.

And so in the third place, Use 3. Prevention.
this serves to meet with a conceit that keeps many from looking after the
things of Gods Kingdom, because they fear that they shall want necessaries,
if they shall so do. For, to omit that true Fides famem non formidat, Hieron.
ad Heliodor.
Faith, as Jerome speaks, fears not Famine: and again, that he is
unworthie this Crown, this Kingdom, that prefers worldly trash before it,
or Mat. 13.44, 45, 46. Luke 14.26, 33.
that is not content Philip. 3.7, 8, 9.
willingly, yea and Hebr. 10.34.
gladly, Omnia relinquas, ut hoc habeas, Sen. epist. 76.
to forgo the one, for the attaining and compassing of the other: Such fear
is wholly superfluous; it is a groundless fear: Since that God the Father by
Jesus Christ his Son and 2 Cor. 1.20.
his Surety, has here given thee assurance; that so long as thou seek it as
thou ought, At necessaria decrunt. Deesse non poteru^t, Sen. ep. 17.
thou shall never want ought; all other things shall be from God himself
supplied to thee with it. And Psalm. 34.10.
the Lions themselves therefore, says the Psalmist, (and the Lion is the Prove.
30.30, 31. Rex ferarum, Isid. Orig. l. 10. c. 2.
King of beasts,) shall hunger and starve; those that are likeliest to be fed:
But those that seek the Lord shall want nothing that is good. He Psalm. 78.24.
Pluviam escatile^. Tertul. de Patient.
will rain bread from heaven, and Psalm. 78.20. and 114.8. Petram aquatilem,
Ibid.
set the flintstone abroach, and turn Psalm. 107.35. 2 King. 3.17. Esai. 43.19,
20.

perish.

Yea this rather should enduce, encite, and encourage us to seek, Use 4.
Encouragement.
as the more carefully, so the more cheerfully after these things, considering
that so gracious a promise is annexed thereunto Psalm. 34.9.
Fear, that is, Sicut, 1 King. 17.32, 33. and alibi.
serve the Lord diligently, ye his Saints, says the Psalmist: for there shall
nothing be wanting to them that fear him. Parare unde vivam volo. Simul and
parare disce -- Sen. ep. 17. i. vis parare? Parandi rationem disce, Lips.
Would thou then be cared for? Would thou be provided for? Would thou
need to take no more thought or care for ought? Get thee into Christ's Court;
get thee a place in Gods Kingdom. Men think they shall be well, they shall be
safe, they shall be made for ever, when they have got some place, so it be at
least some gainful one, about the King, or belonging to the Court: such an
office could they compass, they should never need more to fear want, or to
take further care for the world. Yet we know and see that such places often bring
Desere palatia: na^ Curia Curis, imo crucibus and mortibus Semper est obnoxia.
Petr. Bles. ep. 57. -- dum excelsus steti, numquam pavere destiti. -- Sen.
Thyest. 3.1.
a world of cares with them, and Pauc^s ^eavit aula, plures perdidit: Sed hos
quoque ips^s, quos beavit, per didit.
area means often to bring men to want. But he that has a share in this Kingdom
of God, shall never indeed need to take further care for ought, shall never
need indeed to fear any defect. Ierem. 17.7, 8.
Blessed is the man, says the Prophet, that depends upon God: for he shall
be as a Tree planted by the water side, that spreads her root along the
river, and does not feel when the scorching heat comes, but continues ever
green, and takes no thought for the year of drought, nor at any time cease
to have fruit on her. Forbear not therefore the following hereof for fear of
want; but follow these things rather if thou would not fear want.

In like manner for your Children, would you have them so provided for, that
you should not need to take any further care for them in that kind?
Distrustful care, I mean still, and of uncertain event; for otherwise 2 Cor.
12.12.
Parents ought to be careful to provide for their children; and 1 Timothy 5.8.
he is worse, I say not, than an Infidel, but Nahum. 2.13. Thren. 4.3. Ipsae
fera savissimae f^^^us su^^^^vent, enutriunt* milvi pullis circumvolantes
rapinis prospiciunt, Aug. de Civit. l. 19. c. 12.
than a brute beast, that does otherwise. But would you so do for them, that
they may be sure not to want? which otherwise, Eccles. 4.14. Amplae and regiae
^pes, ubi ad malum dominum pervenerunt, mome^to dissipa^tur, Sen. de Brev. vit.
c. 1. Irus and est subito, quid modo Croesus erat. Ovid. Trist. 3.7.
though you leave them never so much, they may do. Do the like for them, that
you are exhorted here to do for your selves. A poor man when he has gotten
his child once into the Hospital, how glad is he? he thinks he need take
no more care for him, whether he live or die, whether he leave him ought or
no; (and yet he will do his best to get somewhat to leave him;) he knows
there he shall not want. But get your Children, say I, not into Christ's
Hospital, but into Gods Kingdom of Grace, and they shall then be sure indeed
never to want, you shall need to take no further thought for them. Let this be
thy first care, and thy principal care, as for thy self, so for them, nor how
to make them rich, but Genes. 18.19. Deuteronomy. 6.6. 1 Chronicles. 28.9.
how to make them religious, how to work the sincere Prove. 24.21. Ephesians. 6.4.
fear of God, and 1 Timothy 4.6. 2 Timothy 1.5. and 3.15.
faith of Christ into them. This when thou have once effected, thou need not
be troubled to think what will become of them, if thou be taken away from
them; or what thou shall be able, when thou die, to do for them: thou shall
leave them Gods blessing, if thou have nothing else to leave them; (where
Religion and Righteousness runs on in a race, there Psalm. 115.13, 14.
Gods blessing is also hereditarie with it:) and if thou leave them that,
though thou leave them naught else, they shall be sure to do well, they shall
never want ought. For, Psalm. 37.18, 19.
The Lord knows the days of the upright, or the righteous; says David: and
their inheritance shall abide for ever. They shall not be confounded in the
evil time: and in the days of famine they shall have their fill. And he
confirms it further by his own experience, both concerning them and their
issue. Psalm. 37.25, 26.
I have been young, and am now old; yet (...), Clem. Alex. Paedag. lib. 3.
cap. 7.
never, either in my younger or elder times, have I seen any righteous man
forsaken, or his seed driven to beg their bread. But though he be merciful and
ready to lend, (a means many times to lessen and impair men's estates) yet
his seed after him inheriteth the blessing.

Objection.
Yea but we see even Hebr. 11.37.
godly men many times in want, may some say.

I answer in a word. Psalm. 37.10. and 64.11.
They never want what is good, Solution.
what is necessary, what is Sicut contra de malis Chrysippus apud Plut. de
commun. not. (...). Ai^ sapientem nulla re indigere, and tamen multis illi
rebus opus esse: contra stulto nulla re ^pus est; nulla enim re scit uti, sed
omnibus eget. Egere enim necessitatis est. Nihil autem sapienti necesse est
quod non habet* Sen. epist. 9.
needful and behoovefull for them to have. And whatsoever is not good and fit
for them, it is (...), Di^gen. Laert. l. 6.
better for them to be without it, than with it; to want, than to have it. Do
we not see, I say not, the Sons of Kings, but even Kings and Princes themselves
often by the Physicians direction (...), Dion. Chrysostom. Orat. 14.
imprisoned in their own Palaces, confined to, and cowpt up in their chambers,
restrained of their wonted full and delicate fare, and held to hard meat, as we
say, tied to a strict and spare diet; yea and glad too to observe it, because
(...), ibid.
it would otherwise be worse with them? No marvel then if the godly sometime
in like manner, though Kings and 2 Cor. 6.10.
Lords of all things, are for their spiritual health and further good,
restrained of some things that are not so fit for them at the present. Such
want is no want, when a man rather Aliud enim non habere, aliud carere, Cic.
Tuscul. l. 1.
is without, than wants that, which to be without then is for his good.

To end where we began; let us by any means take heed, Conclusion.
lest our immoderate care for the things of this life, expel and justle out
our care for things belonging to a better life: Congruum no^ est in honor^
solicitudinis nostrae praestantioribus pej^ra subjicere, Eucher. ad Valor.
Let that rather yield to this, and Philip. 4.4.
this then will discharge us of that: let our maine and principal care be for
Gods Kingdom and his Righteousness, and for other things we may then boldly 1
Pet. 5.7.
cast our care upon God, who will be sure thereupon Psalm. 23.1. Luke 22.35.
sufficiently, yea 2 Cor. 9.8. (...), etc. Chrysostom. in (...) l^cum.
abundantly to furnish us with whatsoever Matthew. 6.32.
he shall see to be needful and fit for us.
