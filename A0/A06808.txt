Haste of this new treatise / to purchase acquayntaunce
For no manner ^reatyse / can be more pro^^^a^^e Sanctius: vtilius ho^ nihil

It teaches what things / besemeth to be done
Enduryng man's life / as most expedient

And prudently to puruey / all things for to come
All ordryng in season / according to wisdom
It teaches to temper / dysorder and malice
To mytygate rancoure* and percyalyte
Without fear or favor / to execute Justpce
It teaches in troubles / strong magnanimyte

No coin it requires / as pryse sufficient

And note when thou redest / than is it well content
But if any purpose / of mind beniuolent
With a little money / to bye this small treatise
He surely possesses / no thing of gretter price
Nor his house contains / no thing more profitable Sin verba: and sensus me
mo^^ sub pectore co^da^ The sauros magno^ intus habe^^ p^tet.

So may he well believe: with ^^yte assurance
But such as indeuoyre / with study ferme and stable
Both words and sentence / to close in remembrance
Than has he a jewel: which much shall him auaunce
And closed in his heart / a singular treasour
All transytory treasour / surmountyng in valor
No marchandyse better / in martes may thou find
Than this little book / within it does contain
No better thing brings / the merchant out of Inde N^^ meliu^ ^a^ijs por^at

From D^^^as or Turkey / from Damyane or Spain
From costs of Italy: from Naples or A^mayu^
In all other nations most forayne / far and strange
Can man find no better marchandyse not change
No shop in rich Cite / has better marchaundyse
No grocer / no mercer / nor other merchantes all
Can saty^^ye the minds / with ware of such price
As this book / which profreth the virtues cardynall Nil qu^^^ meli^ biblio
^ol^ tenet.

The book prynter sells* no better thing at all
Who this we^^^ ^^mprys^^h / sure in his mind and though^
Let hymth^^^^ ^^^^rtayne / naught better can be bought
The prologe of Alexander Barclay upon the four Uertues cardynall / to his
right honorable master Gyles Alyngton knight / Translate of the preface of
Domynyke Mancyne by him written / to Frederyke Seueryne bishop of Maleacence.
BIght honorable master / ye me required late
A lovers confession / abrydgyng to amend Dominici Mancin^ in libru^ de
quattuor v^^tutibus ad Federicum Seuerinate^ episcopu^ Maleacensium praefatio
incipit.

And from corrupt English / in better to translate
To your request would I / right gladly condyscende
Were not / that some reders / my warke would reprehende
As to my age and order / much inconvenient
To write of thing wanton / natsad / but insolent
And though many passage^ / therein be commendable
Some processes appear / replete with wanto^nesse
And also the labor / great / long / and importable
Unto my weak wits / my minds might oppress Non mea fert aetas ^uue^les
aedere lusu^:

For age it is folly / and ieopardy doutlesse
And able for to raise: bad name contagyous
To write / read or comon^ of thing venerious
The first reason.
Mine age will not suffer / to write of sport or game
Whereto: wanton iuuent / most wyllyngly intend Quo^que soler vulgus ci
memorare ^oros*

To scoftes and iestes / mine age will not frame
Nor dissolute bourdes / which commons most commend No^ etenim salibu^ cani
sunt mollibus apti*

Hoar age to young bourdes / should not it self extend
A man with hoar heeres / vncom^^y does inclyne
To mystramed fables / or iesture femynyne
An old man decrepite / laded with locks gray Nec deceat iuuenu^ tela mouere
senem. Qua^ turpe est cano su^ gunt cui vellera me^to: Si pueris mixtus fact^^
et ipse nuces.

And with berde like brystels / dependyng on his chyn
With young men's wepen / besemeth not to play
To ga^baude nor florysshe / small praise so shall be wyn
And certesse mesemeth / his wit is very thyn
Which myngled with children / and he a man of age
Would play with cherystones / or nuttes by bota^e
To Caton or Curious / how ill would it agree Qua^ male co^ueniat^^^ neros si
ludat amore^ Vel Cato: vel Curi^: (...) bri cuiusue grauis? No^ homini ceruix
aliter concrescit equ^^a: Quam si no^ proprium sumpserit osticium.

Or to sad Fabricius / the Romayne most famous
Forgettyng their honor / wisdom and grauyte
To write of thing wanton / vain / or veuerious
To man reasonable / is as contraryous
To take on him labor / or business not mets
As to be a monstre / with asses head and fete
Not well he presents / the wower in a dance Non been salta^tis personam
sustinet ille:

But very ill he plays / the volage amorous
Which fettered in a give / would ga^balde / leap / and prance
Attached to a chain / of lynkes ponderous
So faint crooked age / frail and oblyuyous Compede q longa / conprimiturque
graui.

Aggrauat with years / as lynke joined to lynke
Of love venerious: should neither speak nor think
If the crow or cuckowe / pryuate of melody Qua^ merito volucres cornici
illudere certe^t

With swan or nyghtingale / in synging would compare
All birds might them scorn / and not unworthily
What should an premo^ger / mell with a grocers ware Si cantat cygno / vel
philomena tibi?

Or salter with sylkes / full symply could fare
As youth shows sportes / frail lust and vanyte
So meddell should men aged / with thing of grauyte
The second reason.
Ferthermore / the order holy and commendable No^ etiam sanctus quo ascr^bo^^
postulat ordo Et vo^u^ fidei: religioque facra. Me: nisi res sanctas:
^sc^^b^^c: tum meditari

To which: god of mercy has me associate
My faith and profession / should be inviolable
Comaundyng my writing / to be intemerate
These three will none other / but after mine estate
My style and my writing: insuyngly to sound
On thing that on goodness: and virtue has the ground
And utterly to write / of thing of holiness Deque fide sancta / catholicaque
loqui. Cur etenim quisque sacris caeloque dicatus: A sacris mentem dimouet
vsque suam?

And on the same to muse / with pure and clean intent
To speak of holy faith / of virtue and goodness
What should a man sacred / to god omny potent
By god having power / of every sacrament
Since god by such gifts / so greatly does him bind
What should he from goodness turn / or with ora (...) his mind
A warrior or captain / disposed for to fight Militiae ascriptus vir* semper
cogitat arma. Mercator cupidus me^^e volutat opes. Praesbyter at debet vitijs
indicere bellum:

Thinks on his wepyn / his harness and armor
Horse / harness / and spear / are musyng of a knight
The covetous merchant / in mind tourneth each hour
His marchandyse / changes / and fraudulent treasour*
But the prestes musyng / labor / and exercise
Should be in proclaymyng / plain war against vice
And in abydyng battle / daily against syn Et populum summo co^ ciliare deo.
Debet et exempli^ re^ocare: et voce tue^tes I^^^ suo stantes consolidare gradu.

Deuisyng and musyng / with all labor and pain
To reconsyle sinners / and people for to win
By word and example / he ought him self constrayne
Men fallyn / and erryng / to lift and call again
And brefely this ought he / to comfort ignorance
Exhorting good lyuers* unto perseverance
And busely to watch / about our lords told (...) lans arcere rapaces* Et
circum semper aduigilare gregem. Foedius haud quicque quam si sit scurra
sacerdo^. Aut si praedu^^ militi^ arma gerat.

The wild wolves chasyng / from pore and simple sheep
As ready at all season / to soucour young and old
Them chefely attendyng / whom he has cure to keep
But no thing is vyler / nor mouyng more to weep
Than a priest a rayler / dysdaynyng his honor
Or clothed as a courter: or cruel Soudyout
With weapyn or armor / as one ready to fight Sed non foeda m^nus res est: si
moribus ips^^ Fabula sit vulg^ / ^^d^culumque caput.

Usurpyng wrong honor: to lyueng repugnant
And where he by order is called christ's knight
Te be a worldly rybaude / the name is dissonant
And thing not less vyler / is to be ignorant
Of manners uncomely: agey^st all honest
As fable or laughyng stock / of lewdest co^monte
Contemned / dysdayned / and without reverence
For dissolute manners / or wantyng of connyng Aut si continuae ^^^ae*
violentia: ^^te^^ Iurgia: v^^^ ^audes fu^ ta rap^na placent.

Or of his chief pleasure / be set in violence
In dyscord: theft / surfeit / fraud / malice or braulyng
To repyne disposed / or lusts insuyng
And with all these vices / have words rybaudyous
What is more uncomely / or more contagious
Wherefore it not seems / a priest only to keep
His fame and his lyueng / from vices fre and quyt^
But also him seems / for hurtyng of his sheep
Naught soundyng to folly / to common nor to write
Though word be tolerable / what thing one does indyte
If it be infected / by foul contagion
By long time red often / it hurts many one
The third reason.
And certainly I know / while year wont to read Sed neque te quicquam mul^et
Federice legentem Quod procula sancti^ moribus esse v^des Nil etia^ docta
iucu^diau^e capescis Qua^: tibi quod sancta charta ministrat opus.

No thing count ye pleasant / to virtue repugnant
Or that to bad manners / mynystreth any sede
And well I consider / your mind is so constant
That to your prudent ears / naught sounds more pleasant
Than treatise conteynyng / in evident process
The form of good lyueng / and ground of holiness
To this be ye moved / of your nature benign Sic etenim mitis tua fert natura:
be ^^gno Sydera co^^^ncta: sides ^a si qua valent* Sic studia exposcu^t* iu
uenis quae semp amasti Et quae nunc doctus vel vehementer ama^.

Helped my mylde planete / and constellacion
If planetys have power / or may help any thing
So in tender age / your conversation
In virtue and lernyng / and like occupacion
Besemyng your nature / your blood and your lynage
Causes you love virtue / more veruently in age
Also conuersacyon / of wysemen and connyng Sic etia^ comitas porto rum ^uncta
virorum Admonuit lateri nocte di^que tuo. Hortantur veteru^ sic te monumenta
viroru^: Aedidit in^umeros quos seuerina domus

With whom ye joy daily / to be in company
Ercyteth your spyryt above all other thing
To the love of virtue / and of philosophy
The fame and remembrance / of your auncestry
By manyfolde virtues / excyteth you also
From virtue to virtue (as they have done) to go
For certesse the lawdes / renome / and worthy fame Demqueies gestae quo^da^
laudesque pattern: Semina virtur sunt quoquam magna tuae. S^d ^mo^ quae gessit
dux belli et pacis amator. Virtutem saciunt illa virete magis.

And noble interpryses / of old progenytours
At left as bright sparcles / young minds to inflame
And as sede prouokyng / their minds to honors
Not by ambycyon / nor heapynge of tresours
Nor rentes augmented / without law or measure
But by godly virtue / and manners clear and pure
So as in vere veruant / when Phoebus is shynyng Increme^ta velut ^sta^t plant
aribus imbres. Acre cum verno sole tepente cadunt. Sic tu dum spect as vir
tutes ipse paternas / Fo^^entu^ magnu^ das F^dericetuis.

Sweet showers descendyng / with dropes christallyne
End with the dry ground: causyng the plants spring
Rygbtso / ye regardyng the hye virtues dyuyne
Of your old forefaders / shall leave unto your line
Example of good manners / as fruitful nutryment
To dew them in virtue: as plants to augment
But if I would purpose / here seriatly to write Si quis gesta velit nu^c sci^e
^ecentia patris: Hoc ego dicturu^ me ratione negem. No^ etenim possim paucis
concludete verbis. Tum neque narra^di commodus iste locus.

The acts auneient / of your progenitors
My reason repugneth / for wantyng of respyte
For things lately done: by your predecessors
Excytyng noble hertes / to sewe them in honors
To write were long process / and not expedient
Unto this my purpose / but inconvenient
But again to purpose / now to revoke my style Na^ propero ^mos quos cepi
intendere cuisus. Vt dica^: quare non ego scribe iocos. Scilicet haec causa:
est humer* quam sarcina niis:

Where as I first began / this plain is mine intent
Wherefore I not purpose / vain tryfyls to compyle
For to mine age nor order / it is not congruent
Nor to your prudent ears / no thing convenient
Wherefore / me besemeth to write of grauyte
Which to both our states / more comely may agree
Which a priest may write / not hurtyng his estate Nec digna est sanctis
auribus illa tuis. Propterea quamtum potui grauiora petiui: Quaeque tuo possint
aptius ore lege.

Nor of honest name / obumbryng not his light
And that a knight may read / after like manner rate
To this I prepare me / after my simple might
For long have I mused / and studied day and night
What matter I might write / to your auctoryte
To testyfye my love / and my fydelyte
In which two I knowledge / my self unto you bound Quippe quam ardeba^ nostra^
te noscere mente^. Praestate and fidei in te monumenta meae: Quatuor en scripsi
vi: tutum munera versu. Quae deceat hoies: qum probit ipse deus.

Wherefore / to recompense your deeds lyberall
At last / long time musyng / mete matter have I found
That is the four virtues surnamed cardynall
Which comely to be used / are unto man mortal
For them and their suers / god does always commend
Wherefore to my power / to write them I intend
To you these accords / these unto you are dew Haec tibi co^ueniu^t: haec
sunt tibi debita: tanquam Nuper de sancto font profecta tuo. Tu / velut
exe^plar scriptoru^ / and forma mcou^: Quod been conscripsi before ipse facis.

Of you late procedyng / as of their heed fountain
your lyse as example: in writing I ensue
For more than my writing / within it can contain
your manners perfourmeth / and does thereto attain
So / to wchyng these virtues / ye have in your liueng
More than three my meter / conteyneth in writing
My dytyes indyted / may counsel many one Haec alios / no^ te poteru^t mea
scripta mone^ Scripta monet alijos: tu mea scripta mones.

But not you / your manners surmounteth my doctrine
Wherefore I regard you: and your manners alone
After whose lyueng / my process I combyne
So other men instructyng / I must to you inclyne
Conformyng my process: as much as I am able
To your sad behauour / and manners commendable
But though your bye courage / belongyng to a knight Et maiora licet sacra sub
pectore verses: Nostra tame^ legito: cu^ datur ipsa quies* No^ aquila aertas
semper petit ardua nubes. Proxima sed terris illa aliquando volat.

Muse on gretter matters / than I intend to write
yet all things ended / at morning or at night
Read this my rude meter / at layser and respyte
The Egle at all seasons / has not her most delight
To fly to the clouds / nor hyer in the Air
Some time nere low feioes / her pleases to repair
And often has she pleasour / in steyng nere the ground Sic tu: cum cessant gra
uiores pectore cura: Praesta aliquid musi^ carminibusque meis. Laetabor: ta^to
si nostra legantur ab ore. Et fia^t lima s^ meliora tua.

So / when greatien cures / will grant to you respyte
And when your mind from them / for season is vnbou^de
Grant than to our muses some pleasure and delight
That gladly forto read / which gladly I indyte
My spyrit shall rejoice / to here that in effect
My works ye shall read: And them mende and correct
Forthouh in rude metter / my matter I compyle
Men shall count it ornate / when ^e (...) lust to read Prima canenda venit
matter prudentia reru^.

Your tongue shall it polisshe / garnysshe adorn and ^yl^
But this thing omitteyng / I purpose me to speed
To show in what order / I purpose to proceed
First of all in meter / intend I for to shue
Oi sayre lavy prude^et / mother of all virtue
Of whom lady Justyce / draws her holy light Iusticia hinc lume^ mex trahit
alma suum. Post animus magnus / dura oi^a far paratus: Scribitur in fine men's
moderata mihi.

Of whom next ensuyng / I write with brcuyte
Than thyrdly I purpose / for to discrybe the might
Of a valiant courage / or magnanymyte
Ready for to suffer / all hard aduersyte
And than last intend I: by the deuyne suffraunce
To describe the manner / of lady temperaunce
These four are four wheles: to charet of virtue Quattuor cae cuiru^ to^dem
fecere rotarum. Quem si quis scandat: magnus et altus erit. Nec minus a cu^ctis
spectabit ille triump^a^s. Qua^ toto si quis victor in orb soret.

To which / who ascends / is great and glorious
And as a conqueror / himself plain shall he show
To all manner people / triumphant and famous
And shall be reputed / much more victoryous
More eurouse or happy / more strong or fortunate
Than if the hole world / by him were subiugate
Few kings / few princes / or worldely governors Hunc curru^ rari reges
egere ducesque Rara etenim virtus ec^ quaterna solet. Ergo recognoscas tete mea
scripta lege^do. Te tanquam in speculo / du^ legis ipse vide.

Have into this charet / ascended perfytely
For many in the world / have been great conquerours
And them self have suffered / subdued of folly
But again to purpose / my matter to apply
Consider ye your self / in redyng my writing
And as in a myrrour / contemple your lyueng
Now be yemy Juge / in writing / if my band Ce^sor adds: nu^ quid propero
du^ fingere forma^: Men's been quod vidit est imitata manus. Sediam virtutum
serie^ netremus ab ortu. Principi is not; omnia clara magis.

Shall these four images / forge as they ought to be
Or if the handefulfyll / that mind does understand
This thing to determyne / have ye auctoryte
Now will I here begin / to write with breuyte
Whereof these four virtues / have their orygynall
For when the ground is clear / the warke is clerer all.
Here follows / the four fountayns or wells of honest / which of natural
reason / have De quatuor fontibus honestatis: qui a ratione habent originem.
their beginning orygynall / and of whom the four cardynall virtues spryngeth.
AT the first beginning / our lord omnypotent Principio omnipoten^ caelu^ /
terramque creauit: Et staruit proprijs cu^cta elementa locis. Hinc caelu^
ornauit stel lis: et gramine terras. Era pennatis: pisce re pleuit aquas.

Fourmed heuyn and earth / as witnesses scripture
And in their proper places / set every elyment
Than garnysshed the heuyn / with sterres bright and pure
And the ground with trees / and grass of (...) sshe verdu^e
And beestes in their kind / than filled he the air
With manyfolde byrdes^ of feathers bright and fair
Than stored he the sea / with fysshes in their kind Inde hoiem faciens
simile^: sibi subdidit illi Omne animans: terri^ impetiumque dedit.

All things thus ordered: and plesantly ornate
Like him self he fourmed man of most noble mind
And all lively things / to him made subiugate
At his will obeyng / while he kept his estate
Thus made were all beestes / to man obedyent
And man only subject / to god omnypotent
Than god him exalted / to have dominion Hu^c et participe^ ratio nis fecit vt
illa Differat a reliquis dissociante ferts. Hic igitur: ta^to ro^nis munere
fretus: Scrutari incepit oi^a mente sua.

Over the broad world / and thereto did him able
Of his goodness: mankyng him partner of reason
Whereby he dyffereth: from be unreasonable
Wha^ man had this treasour / and gift incomparable
By reason he began / to compase in his mind
And search the secrets / of thing of every kind
Of the oryginall of prudence.
So mankind aduertyng / and pondryng by wysoome At: dum praeteritis quae sunt
praesencia: nectit Qualia sunt certa: me^te futura videt. Proptereaque parans
illis quodcu^que necesse est

Things gone and passed / and also thing present
He sees for certain / what seems for to come
And against it happyn / is not improuident
But makes prouysyon / for all impediment
Of things necessary / wantyng nothing at all
But him self preparyng / to chau^ces or they fall
Himself so disposyng / by reason president Prude^tis meruit: nome^ liabere
viti. Atque eade^ ratio multos coniunxit in vnum Colloquij causa / praesidijque
simul.

Thing passed to consider / thing present well to frame
And for things coming / well to be prouydent
Thus of a prudent man / deserves he the name
These things consydred / than reason is the same
Which joins man to man / for love of company
For co^munyng / comfort / and socour necessary
Of the orygynall of Justice.
And so / when much people co^^oyned is in one Impulit and coetus cogi parere
iubenti: Vrbibus and positi^ viu^ re lege viros,

Reason has them moved / to be obedient
To such as excels / in wysdom and reason
Whereby the common well / of cite excellent
Has first chief beginning / and greatly does augment
Than reason requires / to ordeyne right wise law
Transgressors to chastise / and to keep under awe
To socour and defend / the weak and Innocent
And proud rasshe rebellers / with reason to chastyce
Thus: each state them byndeth / to be obedient
By instinct of reason / to laws of Justice
And each in his order / him self to exercise
For dread of correccion / not presumyg to do
But like as he him self / would gladly be done to
This same law of nature / engendered bath of kind Praecipuu^ in sobole^ pa
tribus generauit amore

In fathers and mothers / a leave most pryncypall
Anenst their dear children / And after that does bind
Them to their Progeny / In love most special Inque alios: sicut sanguinis
ordo inbet.

To such / as of their blood / they know nerest of all
Thus love in degrees / by nature should agree
After the degrees / of consanguynyte
And therefore the Parents / endeuoyr with all art Hinc patres curant na tos
omni art tueri. Hinc nati patres pro pie rate colunt. Haec iubet officijs
homines certare vicissim

Their children to defend: to conforte and maynteyne
The children in likewise / of nature do their part
For pytie to worship / their dear patent again
This Justyce commands / this nature does constrayne
So reason toyneth man / as brother unto brother
To contend in kyndnesse / and doing one for other
Each other to comfort / when is necessyte
Thus reason contoyneth / the bonds of concord Inque vicem aduersis rebus
adesse iubet. Haec inter populos: et reges foedera nectit. Haec inter raros
iungit amicitias.

It peace reconseleth: love / faith / and charity
Betwyxt king and king / and between lord and lord
Thus reason by Justyce / excludes all discord
For while every parsone / by justice has his right
It is a brutall fury / in battle for to fight
But such as in riches / and reason does habounde
By the gift of god / to them granted of grace Plus in^ officijs certa^t /
opibusque ferendis. Qui: donante deo: plus rationis habent. Sic hoim comitas
firmata / and viribus auctae^,

With riches and reason / these strive as they are bound
Must the pore to socoure: in every needful case
Thus gentylnesse of man / augmenteth with solace
Thus manners augmenteth / thus chastesed is vice
And virtue auaunced / by reason and Justyce
Emperes thus augment / by Justyces reward
And most sovereign gydyng / Thus is benygnyte
From man to man showed / Thus manners go forward Sic aucta imperia munere
iusticiae.

And branches delateth / of peace and unity
Thus chastised is sin / and all enormyte
And all thing reduced / to right dyrectyon
By mean of Justyce / procedyng of reason.
Of the orygynall of magnanymyte / or strength of mind.
FErthermore: by reason: grows in man's mind Praeterea innata est ex hac
ratione cupido. Mentibus: vt semper ab dita nosse velint, Vt ve^: simplexque
bonu^ depre^dere cure^t. Et postquam notint / id vehementer ament.

A natural desire / always with besy cure
Chynges hyd and secret / to search / know and find
Oftre we and parfyte good / the knowledge to procure
Which knowledge obtained / when they thereof be sure
Of natural instynct / this reason does man move
Such treasour obtained / much fervently to love
Reason also moves / man: greatly to labor Quippe: quam est ho^i mayor non
vlla voluptas. Illa: qua discit / continueque sapit.

To search and have knowledge / of troth and verite
For certainly to man / can be no more pleasour
No more iocunde pastyme / joy nor felycyte
Than daily for to learn / and more prudent to be
To sauer and perceive / by reason what is right
Than clered is his mind / with perfyte in ward light
Wherefore often it hapnith / wha^ man the troth has found Saepe igitur very
sic ser uet amore reperti Men's nihil vt duri res puat illa pati. Casibus haud
vllis / no^ vllo victa labor: Pro vero est morti nes cia terga data.

His mind is so fervent / for to defend the same
That for the love thereof / he cares for no wound
No hard thing nor grievous / can him subdue nor tame
No chance / nor no labor can myttigate this flame
No tyraut / by turment by death / nor other pain
From mayntena^ce of troth / can him move or co^strayne
Thus is his bold spyryte / in manner inuyucible
In hard chance he cou^teth no great dyffyculte
No labor nor travail / he counts impossyble
In the troth defending: Thus clearly may we se Tertia sic virtus men's alta /
and magna vocata est.

How of reason spryngeth hye magnanimite
And boldness of spyryt / which troth for to defend
Both blood / life and goods / refuses not to spend
This third noble virtue of magnanimite
Thus rysynge of reason: some men call fortitude Quae semper custos
simplicitaris adest.

Protector of the troth / and for symplicite
Renouncing no rigor / nor no solycitude
Called is it strenght / of common people rude
Or boldness of spyrit / but no we let us auance
Our style / to descrybynge / the ground of temperance
Of the beginning of temperance. Nec parua illa quide^ vis est ro^nis habenda:
Per qua^ nos nimiu^ cer nere pulchra iuuat. Quantus inest ordo rebus: vel
qua^ta venustas Solus homo solers perei pit: atque videt.

yet reasone has one might: not to be counted small
Whereby: it excyteth / man to felycite
For to behold things / fair pleasant and formal
And to take great pleasure / aduysynge their beawte
Man: only by reason / perceyueth and dothse
How good^ an order / and what beawte ornate
Is in worldly things / of god almyght create
Therefore when the wise man / this beat does behold Hanc igitur facie^ mu^di
/ formamque decoram Cu^ sapiens spectat: di ligit / atque probat.

Co^sy derynge this shap / and pleasant form mundayne
He prayseth the fayrnesse / with lauds many fold
And knows by this form / the form sovereign
Than reason reduces / unto his mind certain
That than is thing decent / and synguler beauty
When all thing proceeds / in order and degree
When man this reuolueth / delytynge in his mind Tu^ secu^ loquit^. Qua^tores
pu^chrior esset Si tantus nostris moribus ordo foret. Propterea exe^plo terum
co^ponere mores

Than says he to him self: O lord eternal king
If so goodly order / in manners of mankind
Were dueuly observed / it were more plesau^t thing
Wherefore he contendeth / by reason him gydynge
After such example / of outward thing mundayne
His own life and manners / in order to constrayne
And such inward beauty / to give unto his mind Ni^itur atque aio tradere
tale decus. Ergo nil sordis / nil and co^mittere inepti. Prouidet: et nullam
prorsus habere nota^.

As in outward things / he does behold express
Wherefore he prouydeth / as reason does him bind
To conform his manners / to so fair comlynesse
Sufferynge in him self / no foul vnclenlynesse
No vice nor disordre: nor other spot at all
In wordys dysolute: nor warkes special
So that no manner fault / nor blame in him be found Ne quid vel nimiu^ sa
^acia^ / vel po^dere ma^cu^ Sirque deus ^ebus te^poris / atque loci.

By passing / in his deeds: due order or measure
In doing over much: or less than he is bound
Or not in dew season: repugnynge to nature
Therefore does he study / and muse with busy cure
His deeds to redress / and do in every case
According as requires / the season time and place.
Thus tyseth in the mind / the fourth noble virtue Denique sic animo virtus
moderatio su^git Ordie quae quarro co^ numeranda loco est. Quattuor has igitur
pertes co^prendit honestum. Quas omnes ratio co^^icit ipsa tibi.

Called Moderacion / or else Temperance
Which virtue auanceth: and vices does subdue
Condutinge mankyde / in goodly governance
So: these four conjoined / shall their hauer auance
To the sure prosession / of perfyte honest
And first upon reason: all four grounded they be
Which reason is granted / by god unto mankind
As most sovereign auctoure / and gouerner most sure Sed deus ha^c homini
ro^nem co^tulit auctor Nature vulgus dictitat esse deum.

All if common people / dull / ignorant and blind
Ascrybeth this hye gift: some times to nature
It taking / as god: against just scripture
And simple creature / exalting with honor
Which only belongs / to god our creator
But favorable redar take thine eleccion Sieve igit^ place at: naturae numera
dici / Sieve dei: arbitrium sector habeto tuum. Hoc ego p^stabo distin cte vt
singula tractem.

Whither thou wylt call / these virtues cardynall
The gifts of nature / procedynge of reason
Or rather the gifts / of hye god immortal
As touching my dute / this thing perfourm I shall
Of these four distynctly / to fynysshe this treatise
Unto the laud of virtue / and reprouynge of vice
And first shall I begin / at virtue of Prudence
First grounded on reason / of whom the other three
Proceeds as branches / of hye preemynence Primu^ and prudentia or dine munus
erit.

But favorable redar / where thou shall here orse
Ought soundynge in my warke / against grauite
Ornat comely ordered / in meter or substance
Correct I require the / my simple ignorance.
Of the first Cardinal virtue named Prudence. De prudentia.

THe first place and party / longyng to honest Primus honestatis loce^
disquaerere: quid sit Veru^ / vel falsum: quae mala / quidue bonum. Hoc adeo in
hois naturae / et viribus aptu^^

Is the noble virtue / which called is Prudence
This teaches for to sertche / the clear dyuersyte
Between good and evil / or virtue and offense
Between treuth and falshed / it sertcheth dyfference
And this inquisicion / to man is natural
And more convenient / than other things all
No thing is more propre / nor apter to mankind Nil magis vt proptiu^: nil
deceatque magis. Ducitur ois eni mortalis amore sciendi: Prorsus vt ignotu^ nil
velit esse sibi.

Than to have clear knowledge / of things natural
For of every man / this is the will and mind
To love to have knowledge / and perceive things all
Except some blind wretches / not humayn but brutall
Only in the womb / as beestes delytyng
Man would have vnknowyn / to him plain live thing
Al things he sertcheth: al thing consydereth he Omnia vestigat solers et
mente volutat. Na^ labi / et falli turpe malumque putat. Est aute^ prude^s:
quisquis disquirit honestu^ Aturpi: vt tantu^ possit honesta sequi.

In mind them reuoluynge / with perfyte dylygence
For he counts it foul: ill / and dyshoneste
To err / as ouersene in wrong / by negligence
But that man is called / a man of true prudence
Which tries forth the troth / dyscerninge good from ill
Honest from dyshonest: and does the best fulfill
But no man is able / this perfytely to try Hoc no^ discernet: nisi qui
meritur idipsum. Vt natura sua iudicat et ratio. No^ qui quisque prouat:
prudens ea recta probabit.

Nor dyscerne thing honest: from bad and dyshonest
Except he it measure / and ponder perfytely
By natural reason / iugyng within his breast
Nor the parfyte wyseman: allows not that best
Which most is commended / of people imprudent
Or unstable commons / of v^ylful Jugement
But that thing he demeth / honest and commendable Sed: quae iudicio comprobat
ipse suo. Hoc sed iudiciu^ ratio dominata gubernet.

Which he himself iugeth / in his intencion
But this same judgment / may not be disceyuable
Nor wandering at pleasour / but subject to reason
To whom the apperyte / in like condycion
Must be obedient / and will / as seruitour
Reason always regent / chief gyde and governor
As the child obeyth / his master him teaching Pareat and se^sus: vt puer
atque comes. Ve^u^ / quo leuius rectu^ digno scere possis: Hic quasi perspicies
singula lector habes.

And as pilgrims follow / their gyde to fly dangers
So will and appetyre / to reason in all thing
Must obey and follow / than judgment is dear
But that this same virtue* more plainly may appear
And lyghter to knowledge / here reder thou shall find
Each party dyscrybed / distynctly in his kind
Two fautes to be exchued in prudence.
Therefore / who requires to purchase honest Imprimis igitur quisquis
perquirit honestu^* In vita agno^cat ee^ ca uenda duo. Est vnu^: ne scire
putet: quae nescit: et illis Haereat / vt certis: credulus ipse sibi.

And laudable life / by virtue of prudence
Ware of two things / in lyueng must he be
One is / that he count not / him self to have science
Of thing whereof he has / plain none experience
Nor knowledge / as cleuynge to his own fantasy
And pryuat opynion / mentaynynge hardely
Him self countynge certain / of thyngys incertayne Plurima na^que late^t
caecis abstrusa latebris: Quae neque de facili ^sque videre potest. Ergo illis
temere tu consentire caue^o. Ne capiat sacti te cito poena tui.

And lightly beleuynge / what falls to his mind
For many things be hyd / and not clear nor plain
But with obscure knowledge obumbred of their kind
Which of a wise person / are not easy to find:
Wherefore beware / rasshely to these soon to consent
Lest thy hasty deeds / soon cause the to repent
In such obscure things / requires great study Hic opus est studio: hic cura
/ et te^pore longo. Hic quoque p^eptor for ^e vocandus erit.

Great cure and compasynge / long time and dylygence
And here parauenture / man must him need apply
To call for a master / experter inscyence
Of such secret things / having experyence
And in such hye things / does profit farthermore
Experience and proof / of things done before
And the faitfull hertes / of friends sure counsel Proderit in multis simul
experientia ^e^u^. Proderit and fidae pectus amicitiae Rebus in ambiguis par
tes scrutaberis amba^ Vt ^quaecunque venit: res tibi tuta cadat.

In such things doutfull (if thou to them resort)
Shall greatly the profit / and troth unto the tell
But in such things doutfull / it is to man confort
To search both parties / To reason to resort
Both wisely dyscussynge by search dyligent
That what so ever fall* come not vnprouydent
As well as for the good / provide thou for the ill Non satis est istam pat tem
munire* vel illam: Altera si restat debili^ atque vagans.

As well one as the other / may fortune for to fall
To provide one party / it is not parfyte skyll
Thou must before danger / ymagyne dangers all
And than for them puruay / by wit substancy all
One party provided / an other neglygent
And lame / this not seems / a wise man and prudent
It is not f^ll enough / when serpents men assail Non been prouidit: ta^ tu^
qui a dente colubri Cauit^na^ pariter cauda cauenda fuit. Sic age: quod nunquam
dicas* non ista putaram. No^ sine dedecore fertur id ore viri.

Al only for their mouths / to make prouysion
Man must in like beware / both of the toth and tail
For though the toth trencheth / the tail bears poison
Wherefore so behave the / in every season
That thou say not after / I thought this should not fall
For without dysworshyp / thus says no man at all
Nor suffer not this thing also / the to dysceyue Nec te decip^at / quosda^
quod decipit illud: Du^ quaecu^que sua recta* and honesta putant:

Which many has dysceyued / debowtyng from honor
In their own co^ceytes / while they chief plesour have
Led blydly as beasts / in brydyll of error
All thing countynge honest / which is to them pleasour
Whose lust is their law / from such thou must declyne
Lest thou them ensuynge / fall heedlyng to ruin
Such only ensuynge / their pryuat judgment Iudicio addicti proprio^ seruique
suorum. Errorum* credunt s^ nihil esse supra. Auelli nequeu^t vlla ^a tione /
vel art. Iudiciumque omni plus ratione vale^.

To their own errors as vile servants subject
By leave naught above them / can be more excellent
And naught can them alter / nor move to good effect
No counsel nor reason: their minds can correct
Above all good reason / reigns there judgment
And obstynate purpose / as asses imprudent
As fathers have / custom often times to commend Vt solite patres natorum
crimina sepae. Laudare. et bonis credere digna suis. Vt: qui fecit opus
sculptor / ca^^^nque poet^.

The vice of their children / product in error blind
Ready in all crimes / their fautes to defend
A^ paynters and grauers / or poets having mind
In payntynge or grauynge / or fresshe meter to find
Commends their works / and thinks them pleasant
So ioyeth in folly / blind foles ignorant
An ouersene poet / dare great Maro despise Saepe is phidiacu^ spernit: and
arma virum: Sic isti proprios mores venerantur: adora^t. Quaeque alij. faciu^t
vt viciosa: premunt.

His own art delytynge / indyted folysshly
The paynter despyseth / Apelles in like wise
And Phedias / dispyseth the grauer semblably
So some dotynge foles / in error led blyndly
Commend their own manners / and praise above althinge
All other men's warke / extremely deprayuinge
What causes such folly? what moves this error? Quippe:quam a reru^ fallu^
^u^ a^^o^e suarum. ^ec (...) ipsos pror(...)ant. Quicquid ^^^t ipsi ge^mas:
auru^que licentur.

Forsooth this is chefely / the ground original
In their own conceytes / most rests their pleasour
And save their own minds / they love no thing at all
Their own wisdom count they / much clerer tha^ crystal
Above precious stones / and praise it above gold
As able for to teach / and govern young and old
But other men's reason / they count as fylthy clay Tanquam vile lutum cu^cta
aliena serunt. Is ratio explosa e^: atque omnis quaestio viri. Ii minime
dista^t a pecore: atque feris.

This namely does asses / set in auctorite
From such is all reason / and troth driven away
And prudence subdued / brought in captyuyte
Such wretches in living / much dyfferent not be
From vile brutall beestes / which lyuenge in their den
Co^temneth virtues manners / and co^nynge of all men
What man of thing common / belonging to nature Quisquis / naturae quae sunt
co^munia no^ vult. An parte^ e proprijs pbeat ille bonis / At: si te talis casu
subted serit error: Vt nimiu^ tribuas partibus ipse tuis:

Dispyseth to depart / as reason does require
Of his propre goods how can a man be sure
To have some small parcel / if none of need desire?
But if like blind error / do set thy mind on fire
To thine own opynion: to give to sore credence
yet leave this and lean thou / to men of more prudence
And in mind endeuoyre / to consider and se Tu^c videas: quaecu^que tene^t
sanctique / bonique. Atque ea tu credas ee^ tenenda tibi: Plus oculi cernu^t
multi sub luce serena: Qua^ videt in tenebris vnus ocellus iners.

What wise men observes / whom virtue does inflame
And what men observed / of wit and grauyte
Than think it necessary / for the to do the same
Thus may thou wyn wisdom / laud / honor and good name
For diverse eyes sees / more clearly by day light
Than an one yed blynarde / dark wanderyng by night
Thus first in all deeds / required is counsel Atque / cu^ consilio co^stabunt
omnia certo. Tunc age mature: sit procul ipsa mora.

But when all thing stands / determined cert^^^^
Than all faint delayenge / thou must from the repel
And soon do thy purpose / and deed / with have sudden
When counsel is taken / delayenge is but vain
For often man abides / time more convenient
While chau^ces / and causes / fall less expedient
For many be / which counsel before with perfyte head Su^t multi segnes: and
le^ ti pondere facti: Co^sulte^t quamuis optima quaeque prius. Ii neque
ce^cendi pruden tes na^que relinquunt. Partem: quae prima est officijque caput:

Prouydynge all chances / which may by fortune fall
And when they at endyng / should come unto the deed
Than by sluggysshe sloth / they do no thing at all
Such count I not prudent: none wise / so will they call
For that part omyt they / whereto they should proceed
As chief and pryncypall / that is the very deed
If naught be reduced / to purpose and effect No^ aliter virides florescunt
arbore ^ami Si nequeant proprio te^pore poma legit.

Without deed concluded / what valor has counsel?
When to faint cowardyse / wise counsel is subject
Than far from effect / does all prudence expel
What should the gardyner / with ympe or graffynge mell
Or grene bows b^rgyn / with leaves and blossom^
If no fruit in season: shall on the trees come
What should a man of war / or subtle capytayne Nec secus inmedijs se
^actant agmina ca^pis. Si conserta manus nulla trophea resert. Sic etia^ cultis
ma^dan tur semina fulcis: Ni segetes ^ostas falce sonante meta^.

Assemble a great army / she wynge his pomp and glory?
And mustre in the field / crakyng all day in vain
Without wise entreaty / or fighting for vyctory
What should the husbandman / in land or terrytory
Commit sede / or labor his feldes even or morn
Except the in season / may of the same reap corn?
All things are used / for profit of the end O^s enim sua lau^ virtutis
facta requirit. Na^ sine re prodest con suluisse parum. No^ tame^ ille caret
vit tutis laud perenni:

The fruit and auantage / is conforte to labor
And in warke all wysemen / use virtue to commend
Thus counsel without deed / is but of small valur^
But this not withstanding / he deserves honor
Whom virtue by counsel / to good deed does inflame
All it he want power / for to perform the same
For many have wise counsel / dyscrete and prouydent Qui bona consultat si
gerere illa nequit. Na^ prohibet multos morbus: nam saepe fac^^ tas. Co^silijs
rectis no^ sinit esse locum.

But their will is let / by faint infyrmyte
Other some have counsel / and find impedyment
By wantynge of riches / and weight of pouerte
But all such as worthy / commended for to be
For all if their power / may not the deed fulfill
yet ought we the^ to laud / for their good mind and will
Philosophers also / and other of wisdom Philosophi pari^ laudem / ^ama^que
mere^tur: Qui been scribe^do secula longa monent. Secundum vicium i^ prudentia.

Which have by wise writing and endless memory
Infourmed and clered / long time for to come
And taught us blind wretches / from troubles tra^sitory
These also deserve not / a little laud and glory
But clear fame immortal: sith by their good doctrine
Right many to good order / ar called fro ruin
The second fault to be excluded from prudence
Est aliud vitiu^ lo^gum consumere tempus: Et nimis studijs ardua quaeque
sequi. Difficiles etenim res quaedam id aginis altae. Quae tamen haud aliquid
vtilitatis habe^t.
There is yet in prudence / another fault and crime
And that is / when people against good reason
Wastes and spends / in vain study / long time
Searching thing / exceeding / their dull dyscression
For some things hard be / in inquisicion
Requirynge great study / long season and respyte
Yet grant they no profit / no pleasour nor delight
For all if they trouble / the minds day and night Na^que nihil fini pro^unt
not moribus ipsis^ Solicite^t animos nocte / dieque licet. Aut si vl recto
possunt conduce^e fini: Haec / plusquam finis: sola petita iuuant.

Of such as them study / yet this one thing is true
Their ending is fruytles / they known: give no light
Their students to gyde / to manners nor virtue
Or if they could do profit / ill manners to subdue
Or to purchase virtue / yet less is their aueyle
Than they give in searching / of labor and traueyle
And pleasour more they give / in serchyng them only Quid prodest varios stel
la^u^ inquirere cursus? Quid res / and causas no scere inepte pet^^?

Than profit or pleasour / proceeds consequent
What profyteth it man / to search busely
The courses of sterres / hye in the fyrmament
What helps this study: here is the time myspent
Un Wise man: what wylt thou? bestow thy daily cure
Superfluously to know / the secrets of nature
Or causes of things / above reason humayne
Which ar more laborious / and hard than profitable Quid cupis inumera^
disce^do a^plectier arts Et toto veros orb te far situs?

Whereto doste thou study / to purchase and obtain
The sciences of arts / or crastes innumerable
Or to recount the countries / and lands varyable
Over all the world / where both the land and nation
Had their first beginning / and situacion
Whereto do rejoice / thy wits to apply Quid gaudes nodis cuctos vicisse
sophistas?

To resolve or argue: with words superflue
The knottes intrycate / of babbling sophystry
In subtle conclusions / the wysest to subdue Aut verbis totum deti nuisse
forum?

All these / if thou wise be: are scantly worth a kewe
What profyteth to study / in glosynge of the law
Sith law without good life / is scantly worth a straw
If thou be wise / of these / naught longs unto the Si sapis isto^ nil
qui^quam pertinet ad te. Simplicius multo est: quod didicisse decet vt recte
viuas: discas: moriareque recte. Haec duo sunt nr^a vi^imus et morimur.

That thing which to learn / to man is more comely
Is greatly more easy / and more symplycyte
That is / well to live: and to dye ryghtfully
These lo^geth to mankind: we live and we shall dye
These two well to order: to gods hye pleasour
And health of our souls: we namely should labor
It is a plain study / pleasant and profitable Est simplex studium: vt recte
versemur vtioque: Et facile est: quod nos numera^e vtroque beet.

In these both our study / to exercise and use
And light is that learning / iocunde and delectable
Which sygneth to virtue / and vices to refuse
Wherefore / we should chefely / both study think and muse
What may make us happy / and to good endyng bring
And certainly this study / is but a easy thing
Than / on this point ground the / heron prefixe thyrie heart Ergo ptius
discas: quid te praestare beatum Possit: et id toto pecto re fige tuo. Disce

And learn the plain passage and way to this wisdom
But when thou art entered / again do not depart
But keep it / until thou to parfayte virtue come
Follow not the manner / of many / whose custom
Is all their life days / co^tynually to spend
In lernyng of this way: unto their latter end
But as myndlesse wretches: never enter they the same Nempe via^ multi
perdiscunt tempore toto. No^ tamen ame^tes ingrediuntur iter. Quid didicisse

Usyng barayne labor and frutlesse sore travail
Aias / man abused / how much art thou to blame?
In lerning of this way / what profit or avail
Fyndest thou / or pleasour / but great cause to bewail
To learn well and live ill / of reason thou must grant
Thou / for all thy co^nynge / art worse than ignorant
Some foles offendyng / are some what excusable
By reason not parfyte / and simple ignorance
But thou having science / thine error is damnable
What lernest thou wisdom / by long co^tynuance
Still blyndly perseueringe / in thine mysgouernance
Art thou called master / go thou so long to scole
To be in thine lyuyng*moche leuder than a fool
What profyteth to learn / that way is so busely Anne via^ mo^stres alijs tu

Wherein / thy leude custom: not suffers the to go
Do thou to teache other: the path and way plainly
And thy self in error: still wanderyng to and fro
Say / is it not a folly: and blind furour also
The fair way to heuyn: to men to preche and tell
Thy self wa^deryng heedlyng: and wylfully to hell
What warnes^ thou other*that thou wylt never do Quam stultum e^ to^^^ noctes

Alas / how great folly it is: to take such pain
Both night and day watchyng: from study not to go
That at last thy labor / be frutlesse and barayne
Certainly / in lernyng / we spend the time in vain
Except the deed follow all / parfytely to bind
Which we at beginning / conceived in our mind

And many / joy the fruit / which have no sede atall
And also sith the end / of learning is the deed
Than seek to do wisely / much chief and princypall
Rather than the scyence*of arts lyberall
Better an idyot / untaught and well living
Than a vycious doctor / ill manered and co^nynge
Wherefore / with good reason: and according to right Iure igitur miles

The philosopher old / loud in the scole cryenge
Was under this manner / reproved of the knight
Said he / wortely master: assure me of this thing
What means this clamor / what means this brauling
What mean all these words / all this dyscord and strife
As between an husband / and a fell froward wife
Ye braule and ye babble / from morning unto night A mane ad nocte^ miscetis

Dyscordynge / One affyrmeth / another does deny
The sage philosopher / than answered to the knight
O son / we endeuoyre and daily us apply
In seeking of virtue / and troth / thus busely
No man has been able / in times without mind
I noughe these to sertche / nor perfytly to find
The knight in scorn smyled / and to the sage thus said
Now art thou gray hered / and tournyng to the ground
And ready for to dye / and as a man dysmayde Es neque du^ virtus ipsa rep^rta

Haste thou not yet virtue / with all thy study found
What time shall thou use it? to live as thou art bound
What time shall thy study / the with the same endue
Sith now in later age / thou sekest for virtue
What thing is thy purpose / what thynkest in thy mind Disce igitur quamtu^

In another world / this virtue for to use
A straw for thy study / thy reason is but blind
To waste time in words / and on no deed to muse
But again to purpose: Therefore reder refuse
Superfluous study / and care superfluous
And turn thy chief study / to deeds virtuous

Is not obscure / secret / dyffuse nor pallyate
But clear / plain / and opyn: It self ready to show
To such as it sertcheth / or will inuestygate
The tree of this science / with branches deaura^e Ordo serua^dus ne minus

Extends not itself / in altytude so hye
But that man may gather / the fruit right easily
The order of things requisite in prudence.
Praeterea officiu^ prudentis noscitur illud: Ordis vt serves inter agenda

FErthermore / this longs unto the man prudent
To pondes al his deeds / and warkes in balance
Of reason: with due order / mete and convenient
Endeuoyr first thy self / to make chief purueyance
For most weyghty things: and greatest of substance
And than lyghter matters / of less dyfficulte
Provide in due order / as they are in degree
It is not thing le full / from mind to set a side Non decet: vt spretis ca^a
cu^ co^iuge natis* De pueris cures: m^^i pijsque tuis. Nec licet: vt vitam: si
mul a^pe^ner^ salute^: Du^ nimio studio quaeris au^rus opes.

Thy dear wife and children: without aid co^fortlesse
And for thy friend / folk / and servants to provide
And certain that person / well may we call wytlesse
Which with to much study*faste seeking vain richesse
As a covetous wretch / commytteth wylfully
His soul / life / and body / to mortal ieopardy
Nor man should not commyt / unto perdicion Non a^am pe^da^* du^ vis te reddere
saluum Corpore: plus a^a nam preciosa tua est. Quid ta^ti facias a^am quo
perdere spernas. Quae merces animae ^ queat esse tuae.

His soul / while he seeks / with mind voluptuous
To pleas his frail body / with delectacion
For more than the body / the soul is precious
What thing should man repute / so dear orsumptuous
For love thereof / to lose his soul: whose great valor
Surmounteth and passes / all temperall tresour
What profit is to man / the world hole to win Quis sibi ^pona^ memento
viuere paruo. A^^e^^^^ demens vt (...) ille mori* Nec nis^ momentu^ dici tua
vita mo^^^u^: Secula si spectes* and sieve fine dies.

And to suffer in soul: sore deedly detryment
To hell pain adiuged: for vile pleasure of syn
What man should be so mad: for this short life present
Eternally to dye / and bide endless tourment
For naught: but one moment: is thy short life unstable
If thou have respect / to time interminable
A sone fading shodowe / is this life temporal
Consumed as a cloud / chased before the wind
But after comes life / or death perpetual
After thy deseruynge / thy merit shall thou find
Wherefore prudence warns man / this to call to mind
And duly him to gyde / in order and measure
Of soul than of body / having more parfyte cure
Another point belonging / to virtue of prudence E^^ cui plus debes cu res

The straytly commands / and charge this to do
Him chefely to regard / with mekest dyligence
And for him most to do / whom thou art most bound to
And chefely beholdon / reason commands so Ante tame^ gratus omnia pone deum.

But if thou be gentle / and kind of dealing
Than must thou thy maker / pre^^^ above all thing
It is not sufficient / to call unto thy mind Non licet officij me^or vt

praesentis gaudia vitae. Sed videas: qualis vita futura tibi est.

To do thy full duty / to every man on ground
And to christ thy maker for to be found unkind
To whom: thou by reason / most specially art bound
For these cadu^ke pleasours / not only should be found
Prouysion in life / but this charge wysdom
To make provision / for life after to come
What longs more to man / than wise and ware to be Quid magis est hoi^s /
quam voluere mente futura. Ne quoth co^tigeat: quod grauitate premat.

And to reuolue in mind / or often before to cast
Al things for the come / that no perplexyte
Inuolue him in troubles / or his wit ouercaste
We know things coming / by things gone and paste
And men us procedynge / abyden have no care
But such may We suffer / than ought we to be ware
As other have dyed / in like manner shall we At ve^tura quide^ mors est: atque
altera vita: Quae premet: aut nobis pmia grata dabit. Quae veniet: nullas
habitura e^ te^pore metas Sic mala perpetua / vl dabit illa bona.

And outher life or death / us after does remain
To reward good lyuers / with great felicyte
Or sinners to reward / with woe / and endless pain
This life is transytory / but life coming certain
Has none end nor mesure / but is interminable
Gyuenge endless pleasour / or pains perdurable
But this short life present / as shadow fugytyfe Ast velut haec vmbrae /
^e^erique similima vento est. Sic bona / sieve mala dat: peritura breui. Hic
locus est veniae ta^tu^ du^ vescimur auta. Ius summu^ nobis altera vita feret.

And varienge as fanes / erect in to the wind
Has no stable pleasure / joy / nor prerogatyfe
Nor permanent sorrow / but sone palsynge mankind
Here may man oftrespas / both grace and mercy find
And of syn remission / if he be penitent
But after is naught else / but right wise judgment
Here / is it much better: more light and tolerable Est satis placidos ad
te^pus far labores. Supplicia aetnis quam tol le^are rogis. Molle iugu^ collo
est: si quod suscepimus vltro. Inuiti grauius sed pa ^iemur onus.

For short time to suffer / light labor of penance
Than after to bide pain / offyer intermynable
And tourment eternal / for our mysgouernance
Alyght wylful burden / is no pain / but plesaunce
Where a weyghty burden / to man's mind contrary
Is grievous sad / heavy / and tedyous to carry
Here / christ is a leche / meke and beneuolent Hic medicus Christus medicat
tristibus aegris Illic vt iudex fro^te ve rendus erit.

Ready for to comfort / alsuche as them amend
Here / is he fesician / to syke and pacyent
Ready salve of grace / and mercy for to send
But in another world / when this life shall have end
As a right wise judge / he shall to man apere
Of sentence in flexyble / and reverend of chere
Terrible to fynuers / and dredefull of sentence
To right wise men joyful: all danger set a side
Wherefore man aduertyse / this counsels prudence
For this day most dredefull: dyscretly to provide
Than of thy disordre / naught can thou close nor hyde
But thy self / heuyn / earth / and hell / shall the accuse
Wherefore on this countes / man specially should muse
Count thou nothing caduke: dayne / frail / and te^porall Non tu magna putes*
quaecunque caduca videbis. Id pete: quod du^a^: perpetuumque manet.

To be great in valor: or lyftyng man to glory
But seek that thing namely / most chief and pryncipall
Which dureth eternal / not vain nor transitory
And prudence the charge / to have in thy memory
On transytory treasour / not much to set thy mind No^ etiam serves: quae
sunt tibi mox peritura

Which thou / without profit / at last shall leave behind
Use temporal treasour / while thou art lyuenge here
In charytable deeds / on poor people that fail
Lest after thy partynge / when thou art laid on bear
Thy good superfluous / may little the avail Ne tibi non prosint: si qua
supersuerint.

Provide for hard chances / which after may assail
And make sure prouysion / in most pleasour and rest
For after fair season / often falls fore tempest
Look always that thou live / constant and ^yght wys^y Fac just semper vi^^^
and iunct is iniquis: No^ te commutes: quin magis aptus erit.

Change not thy living / from virtue till offense
All if thou be tangled / with wretched company
But dress the to suffer / all pain with patience
For time: for bear foles / this counsels prudence
When obstynate wretches / by doctrine will not amend
Again them / is folly: with words to contend
But ever more beware / and se thou namely fear Tunc vero aptus erit: cu^
iustu^ te^dis ad illud: Semper: et ad tempus scis variare vias.

That their corrupt manners / not after thy living
Dyspose the / them rather / to suffer and forbear
And part to conform the / as asks their dealing
As now full of sadness / now merry co^munynge
Uaryenge thy manners / to place / person and time
But always concludynge / on virtue and not crime
Thou feast diverse ways / often leadynge to one place Saepe via e^ duplex: quae
ad metas ducit easde^. Altera nunc clausa est: altera aperta paret. Vt manus in
palma^ modo se distendit: and aptat In pugnu^ rursus: and tamen vna manet.

The One sometime opyn / th^ther close and shyt
The hand is extended / sometime under like case
And sometime together / again closed is it
But one manner of hand / still it remains yet
And many other things / often vary of figure
Not changynge in matter / in substance nor nature
Right under like manner / uses the prudent man Sic prude^s semper iustus
permanserit idem Sed sumet vultus: quos monet ipsa dies. No^ leuis / vt ve^tus:
sed pro re mobilis assis.

Persevere in his goodness / right and symplicite
But as time requires / his chere vary he can
In fair moderat wise / to mirth or grauyte
A wyseman not seems / light as the wind to be
Now in and now out / in certain and unstable
But as the case requires / at certain time mouable
Be constant and constable / not hard and obstynate Co^stans: no^ durus: pro
positique tenax. Nec cito credideris: fuerint quecu^que relata Discutias omne
quod secus esse potest.

No wyseman him shows / selfwylled intretable
Nor in his opinion / all season indurate
A man of such manners / uneath is tolerable
Think not that all tales / ar just and veritable
But wisely discuss thou / such things as may vary
And from the first report / prove afterward contrary
Often is he disceyued / and often disceyueth he Fallit^^et fallit: faciles qui
co^modat aures. Esse a prudente debet vtrumque procul.

Which to fleing tales / to light is of credence
The wise man not seems / a dysceyuer to be
And to be dysceyued / is sign of necl^gence
Excluded should be both / from man of clear prudence
O how many princes / have fallen to ruin
Which would to vain tales / to light ears inclyne
Often thing seemed feigned / has been certain and true Saepe suit verum: quod
res co^ficta videtur. Visaque res vera: ficta re perta fuit.

And thing true and certain / seemed vntre we and feigned
Whose color has caused / right many sore to rewe
For their honor wasted / their name and fame distayned
Let such hasty credence / therefore be refrayned
And or thou give credence / all thing wisely discuss
Prudence: for thy profit / the straytly charge thus
O how often has hyd treuth / and simple veryte Delituit veru^ quoties sub
imagine falsi^ Et falsum viri imagie delituit? Non proprios vultus seper
mendatia gestant. Saepe and simplicitas cre ditur esse dolu^.

Lurked under image / of falshode nubil^te
And how often has falshode / semynge symplicite
Lurked under image / of t^enth so palyate
Whereby symplicite / often time is vyolate
Often lies ar cloked / aperynge treuth somwhyle
And often symplicite / believed fraud and gyle
As faynynge flaterer / presents outwardly Vtque assentator fro^tem sibi
sumit amici: Sic^qui recta manet / sae pi^^ hostis habet.

In word and in vysage / afrendes countenance
So sometime a true friend / seems an enmye
While he sharply blames the / for mysgouernaunce
yet would he by counsel / till honor the auaunce
Be circumspect and ware / for much better it is
To bide a friends anger / than a foes kiss
In hyd things doutfull / give not sodeyne sentence Non tibi de dubsjs sen
tentia certa ceratur. Sed suspensa quidem reddere verba potes.

And certain Jugement / in things incerteyne
To callers importune / of words be suspense
Redoublynge delays / till treuth be tried plain
Better so than Juge / and than revoke again
In sentence remyse / is lesser injury
Than in heedlynge sentence / pronounsed hastily
When thou shalt ought do / of inexpert or new Cu^ quicquam facies / impri
mis mente voluta: Quantum est / and male quod queat inde sequi Nil tibi sit
subitum nil aggrediare repent: Si res est durans: est pa tiensque morae.

First ponder in thy mind / reuoluynge busely
What manner / and how great thing / may thereof ensue
Attempt nothing weyghty / in haste nor suddenly
If things may bide / tarry / begin thou not rasshely
For enterpryses rasshe / hasty and repentyne
Ar chief things bringing / great warkes to ruin
Therefore in all doutes / use moderate delay Quod dubitas: differ: melius
suspe^de parumper. Quod gerit: donec / te^pore certus erit. Praetere a quicquid
noscis non sure fuisse Inceptum debes defer uisse cito.

And that is to be done / best is / a while refrain
Inquerynge and searching / with wisdom day by day
Till by contynuaunce / at last thou be certain
And thing not well begone / leave of lightly again
For better is be counted / somewhat presumptuous
Than negligent / obstynate / wylfull injurious
Be not to suspecyous / in all thing misdemynge
And if this fond error / within thine heart arise Si tibi suspitio fuerit sub
pectore nata. Illa quidem cesset: sed tamen omne cave.

Constrayne it for to cesse / for to mysdeme all thing
Thou causest the fautlesse / often frauds to deuyse
And after thy sore damage / also the to dispyse
Thus fly thou suspection / yet gyde the by wisdom
To be ware / and puruay / all things for to come
Use in thy comunynge / other men to tell In sermon tuo vl quae sunt recta
mouebis:

What things be ryghtwyse / what way is most laudable
Them warning and mouynge / to good / by thy counsel
Or to thine own person / se thou be profitable Aut rectu^ quaeres quod
latuisse solet.

Seeking the way of troth / as much as thou art able
Which oftyn time is hyd / and not light to dyscerne
Thus always employ the / to teach or else to learn
To rude and unlearned / endeuoyre the to show Ignotum rudibus mitis monstrabis
honestum: Praecipies illis: quos tua cura regit. At: si solatus fueris sua
damna dolens: Non tibi virtutis pars mediocris erit.

With all manner meekness / love and benygnyte
Such things most honest / as they before not knew
Command to the good manners / such as belong to the
Committed to thy cure / but if thou list to be
A conforter to mourners / and wretches miserable
It is a great virtue / and labor commendable
Commend thou in measure / him whom thou do believe Laudabilis parce: que^
credas iure probari. Parcius and da^nes: que^ neque iure probes. Qui nimiu^
laudat: bla^ diri nempe videtur Qui nimiu^ da^nat: credita lingua mala est.

Worthy to be praised / and of lyueng laudable*
But much more in measure / and scarsly do repreue
Him / whom thou reputest / by myslyueng culpable
Who laudeth ouermoche / though man be commendable
He seems a flaterer / mayntayner of error
And to sore a blamer / is like a detractour
Prefer thou veryte / and treuth before thy friend Quod verum est: caro
praeferri debet amico. Sit very species inuiolata tibi. Discute quid possis /
cu^ vis promittere quicquam. Postquam promissum est: before ipse dabis.

Set more by supportyng of treuth / than amyte
Keep treuth in vyolate / as well in deed as mind
Thy dear friend for sake thou / rather than veryte
Dyscusse or thou promise / if thon may able be
To perform thy promise / when ones made is it
Endeuoyre to fulfill / more than thou did promyt
Take heed to time passed / consider time to come Praeteritum specta tem pus
praenosce futuru^. Vt prude^s petagas: no^ sine laud quod est. Co^moda
praeuideas simul and quae da^na sequa^^ Vt leuius / quicquid ve nerit inde:
feras.

That thou may well order / thing present as is best
To thy laud and honor / according to wisdom
With dew aduysement / consider in thy breast
That all thy busynesses / conclude on one thing honest
And what hurt may follow / or things profitable
So what ever follow / shall be more tolerable
Benat always busy / in warkes corporal No^ tu semper opus sacies: sed certa
laboris. Sit requies animi part erit illa tui.

But sometime release the / of worldly business
Than occupy thy mind: musyng onthyng moral
While thy body rests / and is at quietness
Some pastyme of body / is worse than ydelnesse No^ tamen in requie lu dat tua
dextra fritillo

As tables contynuall / the cards and the dyse
But leave these and study / frequent and exercise
While the body pauseth / in study and pastyme Sed stuij cures te satiare
cibis. Segniciem fugias qua^ do tu cunque quiescis. Versa aliquod mente tunc
pietatis opus

Convenient for minds / as very gostely fode
From mind is expulsed / blind mocion to crime
While the mind is musyng / on thing honest and good
Beware sloth / though labor has sore chased thy blood
Though thou resort to rest / beware of ydelnesse
In mind always muse thou / on goodly business
Or cast ^n remembrance / what labor does remain
What business rests / or remains behind Aut animo tractes quae cunque
negotia testant. Plus etenim semper men's requieta videt.

For as man's shadow / shows more clear and plain
In stremes not troubled / by muddell grave / or wind
So most clear parceyueth / a cawme and quiet mind
It hastes a dullarde / him mouyng to desire
To do some good labor / which virtue does require
A quiet mind sees / all dull perplexite Accelerat tardum perplexu^ digerit
omne.

Determynyng doutes / by wit and reason clear
To light warke it turns / all hard dyfficulte Et durum mollit aspera plana
facit.

And makes hard labors / pleasant and plain appear
Mollifyeng hardness / lyghtnyng the mind and chere
And brefely / who thinks all troubles to oppress
Let him his mind reduce / to rest and quietness
At no time it seems / the mind of man prudent Nunquam prudens mente^ decet
esse solutam: A gestis quamuis dextera fesla vacet. Quid peccent alij non sit
tibi maxima cura Discere quid pecces sit tibi cura magis.

Unoccupyed to be / solute in ydelnesse
Nor from meditacion / remise / or negligent
Though hands be vacant / from worldly business
Let other offense / not much thy mind oppress
And greatly regard not / another negligence
But ponder and repent / thine own fault and defense
Love thou always to learn / and ponder thou nothing Discere semp ama: dimittas
quaerere: ^s sit: A quo per discas: sit didi cisse satis. Consilium alterius de
rebus concipe gestis. Ex minimis eteni noscere magna potes.

Of what man thou lernest / do not the person spare
Demand not his manners / so thou may have co^nynge
Ense we his doctrine / where ought does swerve beware
Of other men's warkes / to take counseyll have care
And by their misfortune: take wisdom and doctrine
By small thing known / great does escape ruin
Learn by small things / greatter to provide
For oftyn by the small / the greatter shall thou know
But if thou list intend / youth prudently to gyde Aetas pma monet: qu^lis sit
quisque futurus. Et reliqua^ vitam iudi cat vna dies.

Consider first in age / how nature does up grow
For after / though manners / often alter / ebb and flow
Oftende and beginning / accorde^h without fail
None makes two hand sword / often plyant cowes tail
To make a straight Jauelyn / of a crabbed tree
Thereon must great labor / travail / and art be laid
Soon croketh the same tree / that good cramoke wylbe
As a common proverb / in youth I hard this said
Wherefore ought our iuuent / be prudently conueyde
With sharp byt of reason / refrayned from wild rage
For sooner break than bow / great trees of long age
When custom and use / is turned to nature
And when young minds / long time rotyd is in vice
It is no small labor / to leave I the ensure
Wherefore / begin tymely / virtue to exercise
And so / still persevere / excludynge all malice
And to sovereign good / and life perfect contend
Remember that all things / are praised at good end
Regard not the doer / nor auctour of the deed
To say or do like him / for his auctorite No^ dicti aut facti quis quam te
mouerit auctor. Sed tantum motus sis ratione rei.

But to the thing itself / with good reason gyne head
If it be laudable / and sound to honest
Than follow thou the same / or elsse thou it fly
Better sue a beggar / in good thing laudable
Than baron or burgays / in things reprouable
All if thou please many / though many the commend Nec tibi plus placias: quia
multin forte placebis. Id specta potius: qualibus ipse places.

Stand in thine own co^ceyt / therefore nothing the more
But what men thou please / aduert and well entende
If they be laudable / than may thou joy therefore
That good men / count the good / be they rich or poor
If ill men commend the / it is nothing laudable
But evident token / thou art to them semblable
Of ill men / it is praise / dispraysed for to be
For plain it apereth / by their malice and ire
Their life and thy living / in one does not agree
But ar plain repugnant / as water again fire Illud fac quaeras: quod no^
repcrire negatu^ est Et tenta: vt discas: quod modo scire licet.

Require thou that co^nynge / and that knowledge desire
Which is not denied / to knowledge of mankind
And learn that is lefull / and profit for mankind
Nor coueit naught in mind: in wysshyng secretly Illa etia^ exoptes: quae
eoram optare licebit. Turpe e^ quod nequea^ concupi jsse palam. Alta nimis
caueas: vbi sit test^te treme^dum: Aut: si desce^das: multa timenda putes.

But that thou with reason / might openly desire
It is thing dishonest / and folysshe certainly
Things impossible / to coueit or require
And than if they come not / to bren in wrath and ire
Of things over hye / se thou always beware
Where unstable standing: often troubles with great care
The tops of mountayns / with lyghtnyng ar brent
More often than low valeys / small stremes ar most pure
So highest degrees / have troubles and tourment
And minds unquiet / vexed with diverse cure
Where simple poverty / is glad quyete and sure
Than coueit not to hye / and to mind se thou call
Much is to be feared / if thou by fortune fall
He slepeth most surely / which is nerest the ground
But namely in tempest / when stormy wyndes blow
The formest in battle: is nerest deedly wound
The ground is in quiet / while sees ebb and flow
Some troubled with tempest / with wawes hye and low
But planly for to speak / who would assende to his
Is weary of welfare / and seeks mysery
Who wadeth to power / or clymmeth till honor
He clymmeth to danger / as blind / led by a line
Of error / vnte thought / dread / envy and dolor
Having for one pleasour: displeasours. viii. ornyne
Honor is a castle / still manacynge ruin
With smoke / sound / and peril / having more grievous fall
Than a simple lodge / or cottage pastoral
Wherefore on suffysance / set thy pleasour and joy Illuc intendas neruos
cunctosque labores: Quo si peruenias: sit tibi parta quies. Sunt quaedam merito
quae perquisisse probere: Sed cum sat fuerit: est retinenda manus,

And coueit not to clyme / since low rowmes are best
But all thy chief study / labor / and thought employ
To come to such rowme / where thou may find sure rest
Some rowmes to purchase / may be counted honest
For honor is duty / of wysemen and prudent
But measure is mean / which ought the to content
When thou haste suffysau^ce / cesse and with draw thy hand
A man may ouerlade / a mighty strong camel Cu^ tibi pro vita fuerit quaesita
facultas: Id quaeras: per quo vita tributa tibi est.

That under such burden / he shall not go nor stand
Wherefore / in this matter / do thou by my counseyll
When thou haste sure substance / for life provide well
By prudence in measure / and nothing excessyue
Than seek that for whose sake / god gave to the life
God gave the not thy life / to gather vain richesse
To win nor yet to waste / this treasour transytory
But to purchase virtue / fair manners and goodness
And by such merit / to come to joy and glory No^ opibus mutis fueris
famulatus auarus. Sed vitae famulas semper habebis opes.

Than serve not dome riches / which blyndeth ye memory
By couetyse to riches / se thou not subject be
But use it in thy life / as subject unto the
^yue thou upon hill / as thon would live in hall
What thou would not do / in opyn company Quicquid non saceres si praesens
arbiter esset. Non magis id facias: hoc quia test cares.

That do thou not aloue / note that god sees all
He sytteth and sees: when thou art solytary
Wherefore in all places / fly every vilany
Of deeds of words / of small thoughts be pure
Till laudable custom / be turned to nature
When fortune shall flatter / with painted countenance
And she we the^ smylyng chere / by faint prosperity Cum tibi redibit vult^
fortuna secundo: Vtere consilijs tu^c magis atque magis.

Than specially beware / make surest purueyaunce
For next in course / comes care and aduersyte
Note fortune is volage / having no certente
Men wise / count low fortune / wore sure and tolerable
Than prosperous fortune / unsure and variable
As after hard fortune / succedeth ease again Na^ velut in lubrico ne queu^t
co^sistere plantae. Sic solet and felix perde re saepe modum.

After pain is pleasour / who can the same abide
So after great pleasour succedeth we and pain
As on a slypper ground / often man does fall or slide
So prosperous fortune / is very hard to gyde
Seldom where is wealth / can virtue long endure
When man is fortunate / often loses he measure
As a ship is tossed / and driven in tempest Nec magis a falsis na^^s gemit
acta procellis. Qua^ ratio i multa pro speritate gemat. Propterea placide du^
spirant flatibus aurae.

Out of course and compase / from place where it should be
So tossed is reason / from ryghtwyse course and rest
By wealth in habundau^ce / and great prosperity
Therefore in cawme season / and sure tranquilyte
Apoynt the for tempest / nor wander not at will
But draw the to sure port / where wyndes are more still
Often under cawme sees / ar perils many one No^ quocu^que lubet: sed loca tuta
pete: Saepe mari placido sco puli latuere sub vnda^. Saepeque perscopulos lae
sa carina fuit.

As swalons / quycksandes / and fordes perylous
Hyd banks of gravel / and great rocks of stone
So lurketh great danngers / in fortune prosperous
Often fall sodeyne storms / and tempest ieoperdous
While under full sail / in cawme wind and pleasant
The shyppesdrely fleteth / no danger attendant
As the ship is bruised / by course improuydent Aequore tra^quillo du^ curru^t
carbasa plena: Improuisa venit saepe procella surens.

By such secret dangers / in most tranquilyte
So wealth / of man causes / to wander negligent
Foreseyng no peryls / nor none aduersyte
So great is the blyndnesse / of vain prosperyte
Wherefore man / advise the / with wit substancyall
In wealth to provide the / for peril that may fall
One thretned (as is said) half armed is and sure Fallere te nullus vult: qui
tibi dura minatur.

And may make prouysion / his enmy to defy
He will not disceyue the / which is of that nature
With hard crakyng words to thretten opynly Sed magis / vt caueas: turbidus
ille monet. Fallimur a placidis verbis / vultuque sereno.

But rather he warns / the to be ware thereby
Fair words us deceive / with smylyng countenance
Such seek after season and time of vengeance
A counterfayted friend / with painted speech ornate Cu^ sapido capimus saepe
venena cibo. Sic soelet arride^s multis fortuna nocere: In quos turbata non
fuit illa potens.

By false feigned favor / disceyueth worst of all
As man takes poison / with meats delycate
And with drink delicious / some venym and mortal
Right so / fortune smylyng / disceyueth under pall
And many one she greueth / in most prosperyte
In whom she had might / in hard aduersyte
Seek after company / as much as thou art able
After thy behauour / thy manners and degree
Often study and desire / unto thy self semblable
If thou such frequent / thou have tranquilyte
But for lack of knowledge / if the fortune to be
In company of such / as ar to the contrary
By malice or envy / yet do not shortly vary
Persevere and assay / by long contynuaunce
If thou may by doctrine / reduce them from malice
From beestyall excess / and wylfull ignorance
To virtue and lernyng / from disorder and vice
But after long labors / if such the dispyse
And if for thy doctrine / displeasour thou do wyn
Than fly and forsake them / enuolued in their syn
And rest not till thou find / a place where as is rest
For where envy reygneth / is no tranquylyte
By many ignorant / one learned is oppressed
Proud and blind ambicyon / gapyng for dignyte
Suspectath a lover / of wylfull pouerte
And ydelnesse conte^neth / study and diligence
For like unto like will / or ought so / by prudence
What should an hardy knight be fellow till a knau^
Or with a tryflyng tyncarde / a clerk companyon
A mason with masons / most sure pleasour shall hau^
A paynter with paynters / is best comparyson
And of other crafts / in like condicyon
A dyamant in donge / is not fair to behold
It loses the beauty / except it be in gold
Therefore / now concludynge / such man as thou wylth^
Endeuoyre thou thyselfe / with all thy dylygence Vir pat^it p^ude^st sed iam
nu^c munera dici. Iusticiae per qua^ nectitur orbis amo^.

With such to resort / to such draw thou the
Than shall thine exercise / have laud and reverence
Thus have we discribed / the person ^fprudence
Now write we of Justice / and her gifts pleasant
By whom the world / in love / is joined constant.
Thus ends the description of the first Cardynall virtue called Prudence: And
begins to be treated of the Second Cardynall virtue named Justyce.
Of Justyce.
Justice / is a certain decre / or ordinance Iusticia est quaedam na turae
sanctio: multis Quae iubet: vt prosis: auxiliumque feras. Inter mortales sic
mutua vincula nectit Humanu^ vt seruet sola vel illa genus.

Ryghtwyse and holy / belongyng to nature
Co^maundynge man to love / to profit / or auaunce
To help and socour / each humayne creature
This justice conioyneth: bonds of love so sure
Between all men mortal / that it only certain
Does preserve in order / or keep lynage humayne
Demand not if that be / thing of vtylyte Vtile no^ quaetas: an sit quod
iusterit illa. Nam quicquid iubeat vtile sempet erit. Iusticiae primae parts
sunt reddere honorem Christo: qui nobis oi^a / seque dedit.

Which Justyce commands / for certesse without fable
Nothing it commands / but right and equity
What ever it does charge / is always profitable
The pryncipall parts / of Justyce most laudable
Is for to give honor / and lauds: as is due
Above other things / unto our lord Jesu
Which of his great mercy / meke and beneuolent
Has given us him self / to be our savior
And all other things / for us co^uement
Wherefore we be bou^dyn / of right him to honor
Without comparyson / before all vain treasour
And who that perfytly / fulfylleth not the same
Of a ryghtwyse person / deserves not the name
What man will enjoy name / of a ryghtwyse man Ergo si quis erit gau^ens
cognomine iusti: ^lle deu imprimis religiosus amet. Sic amet ille deu^:quam
co^tra dignus amari: Quod sibi sit merito gratia part dei.

Must first love / and honor: devout and constantly
Our savior (as is said) as much as ever he can
And so must he love god / with spyryt fervently
That he of gods love / again may be worthy
And dygnely deserve / by favor to purchase
Of our lord and maker / his mercy and his grace
Thus shall our love and service / be to god acceptable Esse deo gratis poterit
quicunque nocere Vult nullitet cunctis vtilis esse cupit. Sic de^est homini qui
nulli lumina solis. Denegat in tris sit licet vsque malus.

If we to no person / do wrong nor injury
But be to all people / just meke / and profitable
Forso / god to man is / of infynyte mercy
Which the sons bryghtnesse / to no man does deny
But suffers it shine / both on good man and ill
Not yeldynge mystyuers / after their fro ward will
The duty of one ryghtwyse / that man does not fulfill Non plene officiu^ iusti
co^pleue^it ille: Qui nulli prodest: qui neque prorsus obest. Quippe requirit
opus quam sit laudabile virtus: Non habet illa satis abstinuisse malis.

Which is to no person / helping nor profitable
Though he do to no man hurt / another good nor ill
For virtue requires / some warke or deed laudable
It is not contented / man not to be culpable
Of man is required / and asked of virtue
Both to do good deeds / and all vices eschew
We be not borne only / for our pryuate profit No^ sumus ad non^a ^p^^ tantum
co^moda nati. Far alij grata^ quisque tenetur opem. Nati hoies hominum ca^
sunt (test Platone) Vt sese faciles vltro: ci tio^ iuuent.

But each man is bound / another for to socour
For as prudent Plato / plain does record and write
One man for another / is borne every hour
And time to be ready / refusing no labor
To confort / to counsel / and socour one another
Both true / glad / and ready / as brother unto brother
Unresonable beasts / often times do the same
Than much more should man: to man be profitable
Or else: if he be not: he greatly is to blame
That is a foul villayne / and chorle abhomynable
Which to his own person / is only charitable
And on his only profit / does only muse and think
Carynge for none other / whether they flete or synke
But one manner reason / nor yet one manner way Nec ratio est simplex^ aut oibus
vna iuua^di. Auxilij cuique propria causa data est. Si nequeas opibus que^ quam
rebusque iuuare: Ast opera salte^ ^ consilioque iuues,

To help one an other / is not common to all
Each man has his manner / and power to puruay
And help / other nedy / by confort frateruall
Some man has great riches / he mar be lyberall
The strong man has power / weak wretches to defend
The wise man has cou^syell / that should he wisely spend
In redressynge errors / informynge ignorant
And opening the passage / to virtue and goodness
If thou can not socour / with wit / nor might puyssan^
At least way be ready / to confort with richesse
Or if thou want riches / yet may thou nevertheless
Confort the poor careful / with counseyl or labor
By one mean or other / so may thou give socour
Or if thou fail counseyl / or have no good to spend Quinotia^ poteris sortis
prohibere note^tes: Ne laeda^t grauius vi^ dolisque bonos,

At least thou have courage / audacyte and might
From ryrannes extorcion / good people to defend
And to bestow thy blood in mayntenaunce of right
This point most conserueth the person of a knight
For right / faith and Justice / fatheries / wydowes good
For maids / king / and country / boldly to spe^dy his blod^
To dye in such quarrel / is honor fame and glory
Such death is mort immortal / and entering in to life
To him and his lynagel perpetual memory
Should a valyant knight / for bread of spear or ^^yle
Lose so great tryumphe / fame and prerogaty^e
Who dare not for Justyce / poor / fame / and glory tyght
Ought certesse be counted / a cowarde and no (...)
Beside all these points / yet ways be there^o Necmin Fiortado solando tumque
monendo: ^urg^do and multos ^pe iuuare potes

To socour and to help / the sick / sorry and poor
As careful confortynge / them easynge of theyr^o
And when hurt apperteth / warning a man before
And some for their vices / blaming with words sore
And some fair exortynge / thus none is excusable
Who none of all these has / is wretched and miserable
But in doing duties / or being profitable Sed gradus ofiici^s dan dis
serua^dus: and ordo est Ordine na^ cuncta sple^didiora nitent. Quippe deo
prime^ debes persoluere cultu^. Pone deum poscit patria prima locum.

Most chefely beholden / due order and degree
For order obseruerd / all thing is more laudable
More comely and pleasant / that they should else be
First do thou thy duty to god omnypotent
Next god: to thy cout^ey / be true and dylygent
To counseyll / to socour / and the same to defend
So doing: thou helpest thy self: ye and all thine
For thy land and country / all these does co^prehende
And all these ^o the pery sshe / if it go to ruin
Than next help thy children / and other of thy line Hic natoacarosquetuoa
tueare parents. Post: tibi quos sanguis quos quoque iu^xit amot

But namely thy parents / most lefe and dear to the
Than kynred and lovers / each after their degree
And when thou have proved / a friend feythfull and stable
Which hard is to be found / yet such one y^thou find
Also be thou faithful / sure / and not varyable
Tohym / as to the one part / and kepar of thy mind Nec quos pauperta^* quos
morbus quosue senectus: Oppressit: spernas: sed misere magis. Inter (...) ho^
si quos mo ru^ co^mendat honest 26

Naught may be compared / to friend loving and kind
Thy chief friend / is Jesu / which put for the his life
So would not thy father / sone / daughter / nor thy wife
Despise not such friends / but have thou most pity
Ofsicke and aged / or opressed with need
And pouerte: sith such have most necessite
Therefore thou should namely / them comfort / clothe and feed
Thou must among these / consider and take heed
If any sometime flowynge / in welthe and honestely ^e
Be fall to poverty / living in care pensyfe
With thine own eyes / behold such pytie Hos oculis proprius intueare tuis.
Sunt etia^ / qui te quon dam iuuere: iuuandi. Sed re^era^t foenus tu^c in amore
vices.

And in thy ^roper person / them conforte and restore
To their old estate / as mothe as is in the
Such as in time passed / have helped the before
Restore thou them again / not less / but rather more
For their one good deed / with two them recompense
This longs to largess / and hye magny sy^en^e
Hesyodus the greek gave this commandment Vt iubet Hesiodus: eam pos imittere
feraces: Semina qui dn^o multiplicata serunt.

If thou wylt be counted / gentle and lyberall
Follow fulsome feldes / abundant of frument
Or a soil well bearyng / fruitful and fair with all
Which always be gentle / in manner prodigal
For one little measure of sede / or else twain
To their lords re^dryng / a score doubled again
yet rests one error / which must be noted here Est tame^ vt caueas: nedum
sis vtilis vni: Id damno alterius fecer is atque malo.

Whereof thou must be ware / if thou be commendable
Uncouer not the church / there with to mende the quere
Spoil not a multitude / of people miserable
To one or two persons / for to be profitable
No virtue is lauded / which ground is on vice
Of thing stolen / accepts our lord no sacryfyce
Provide thou in like wise / that while thou do entende Prouideas parit du^
vis nimis esse benignus: Ne tibi res desit: atque aliena petas. Saepe etenim
censu co^sumpto prodigus omni* Aut rapit: aut turpem co^trahit ipse notam.

Over gentle lyberall / benygne / courteyse and fre
To many men to be / and all thy good thus spend
Lest thy self beg of other / by hard necessyte
For often in the world / this thing provided wese
That when the prodygall / and waster has all spent
He beggeth or steleth / by ways fraudulent
Or if he shame to beg / or fear to rob or steal
Than tourneth he to fraud / and crafty cheues aunce No^ etiam vt magnus fias:
te deed rapinae. Nam neque quo regnes ius violare licet.

Of all men borowynge / on surety / oath / or seal
At last / him with other / so bryngyng to vtteraunce
Give the not to rapyne: thine honor to auaunce
Thou should not vyolate justice / in any thing
Though thou know thereby / for to be made a king
It is not full enough / for one loving justice Nec tantu^ a iusto violentia
longius absit. Sed fraus: atque dolus debet abess^ procul. Vulpeculae fraus e^
via est innata leoni. Vtraque sed justice e^ aliena viris.

For from his mind to cast / wrong and extorcyon
But fraud and gyle / must he in like manner dispyce
Fraud longs to the fox / and might to the lion
Let bruyt beasts follow / beastly condycyon
Gyle / fraud / nor extorcion / belongs in no wise
To men loving virtue / good manners or Justyce
But among all people / no man is more damnable Qui populo ex om^i nullus
capitalior illo. Qui lupus e^ intus: pelle videtur ouis: Nec solum facto sit
saepe iniuria verbis: Obiectes si cui crimina falsa reo.

Than he which resembles / a sheep forth in the skyn
But by cruel purpose / and manners desceyuable
He is in very deed / a ragyng wolf within
A man does not only wrong* injury / and syn
In deeds: But in words / is also injury
Accusyng or slaundryng / the gyl^esse wrongfully
Therefore refrain thy self / from wrong in word and deed Quod veru^ est:
semper prosert semperque tuere S^c nihil vt vero tu ve nerere magis. Nec veru^
credas viola ri posse negando: Quin sic religio est: tu^ violata sides.

And speak that is ryghtwyse / plain troth and equite
In troth still defendyng / great is thy laud and mede
So that thou naught worship / so much as veryte
Nor think thou not / that troth vyolate may be
But that in like manner / both faith and conscience
With troth delyted / and suffers vyolence
In troth / though to witness / man do not call our lord Na^ licet in testem
non (...) deus ipse vocatus: Attamen is custos / vltroque testis adest: Et si
qua^do licet mentiri: sort licebit: Ta^tulum: vt vera sint manifesta magis.

yet is he defender of troth and wyllyngly
And thus is he wytlesse: of his own accord
So / the troth despised / our lord is semblably
And if it be laufull / at any time to lie
Or contrary the troth / parchaunce it so may be
More openly to try / the troth and veryte
And he parauenture / is worthy of pardon Quique fide^ vt seruet ^ue ^it non
vera locutus: Forsitan est venia^ dig nus habere suam. Est serue^da ^ides sic:
vt constantia semper Aisit pollicitis: practaque sancta velis.

Which to keep his promise / forbereth to say truth
As if he constrained / before to some person
To keep some thing secret / has bound him self by oath
Man to break his promise / most commonly is loathe
For sure oath and promise / requires great constaunce
And couenauntes require / troth and perseueraunce
I grant that often time / such chance and time may fall Saepe tamen fateor
te^pus contingere posse: Quod neque da^nandu^ sit violare fidem: Vt quia
promitta^ tibi: quod non vtile fiat: Aut mihi plus nocea^ / quam tua facta
inuet.

That to break thy promise / by oath affyrmed stable
Is not to be dampened / nor blamed naught at all
But rather aloweth / of wise men reasonable
As thing promised / to none is profitable
To the little avail / and great dommage to me
No syn if such promise / not parfourmed shall be
Theseus should have / desired that Neptune Theseus op^asset Nep tunum pacta
negare: Cum taxit miseru^ curribus hippolytum.

Would have broken promise / and made his word unstable
When he with wild horses / for cause not oportune
Drew Ipolytus / to death most miserable
Accused of Phedra / and not being culpable
As innocent Joseph / in Egypt was some time
Of a queen accused / herself in all the crime
If ought be committed / to the in pryuete No^ co^missa sibi iustus secreta
loquatur: Sed taceat: quicquid no^ licet ore loqui: Vocibus ambiguis litis non
semina iactes: Iudiciu^ certu^ sed magis ore feras.

Or in secret counsel / do not the same dysclose
As thy self would have / one secret unto the
So thy self order / in mind and tongue purpose
Do not doutfull words / within thy mind co^pose
Which vttred may be cause / of anger or dyscorde
But plain common langage frequent at every word
Speak so / that none constrerthy words frowardly Aut potius tacias cu^ no^
sit causa loquendi. Saepe sibi atque alijs: gar ^ula lingua nocet.

Or if thou have no cause to speak / than keep scylence
For a chattryng tongue / and bablyng busely
Has often time raised / great inconvenience
Again it self and other / co^myttyng great offense
By words superflue / a fool is known plain
Where wise men by reason / their tongues can refrain
If thou have committed / at any time to the Publica si qn^ tibi sit co^ missa
potestas: Aut si turba tuae sit numerosa domi: Corrige: que^ facinius: quem
reddit culpa nocentem. Non laus e^ leuis quam reputere nimis.

Cure of a common well / to chastyce every vice
Or if thou have household / or meyny in plente
Be bold transgressors / for fautes to chastyce
And among them always / to gyde the by justice
For it is no praysyng / to be to favorable
Nor yet to be counted / a tyran intretable
For while thou have till one / immoderate pity
By love or negligence / or parciall favor Na^ peccare facit multos: qui
ignouerit vni: ^u^ vni ne prodest pl^^ibus ille nocet: Quicqd peccabu^t mul ti:
te dante fauo^em:

Thou causyst many syn / by wild and acyte
yet / naught do thou profit / that one in his error
But many do thou hurt: Thy cause is hard and sour
For what many syuneth / by thy remyse sufferance
Thy self art in fault / and worthy vengeance
And for all their fautes / by right / art thou culpable Cu^cto^u^ iu^e es
^riminis ipse ^eus. Sed fauet is: si qu is no^ punit crimina praeses Iudicis e^
nimius virga benigna favor.

And for their offenses / shall bide punicion
But heed officers / to such are favorable
Whom they not will chastyce / for their transgression
Favor / is a mylde rod of execucion
Of law / right and justice / some iuges mankyng blind
That they seeing justice / will it not se nor find
Often justice is closed / and captyue in prison
Within three fold doors / that no man may he^se
Mede favor / and fear / denies her raunsom
So keeping her oftyn / still in captyuyte
And often these by favor / set her at lyberte
To wander at her will / in places reprouable
Her eyes blyndfeid: by means disceyuable
More plainly to pronounce / law has no lyberte
Without mede or money / or favor parcyall Sub^ubit ille hominu^ coetus: and
subruit vrbe^ Per que^ iusta malis poe na remissa fuit.

But fear / often her keeps / in wrong captyuyte
Instead of true justice / these govern ouerall
For soth he subuerteth / great cities pryncipall
And co^panyes of men / which blyndly spares vice
Not scourgyng mysdoers / by law / right and justice
As he soon subuerteth / old towns of great name Subruit and flamma^ qui
multa^ spargit in edes. Aut remouet portis host premente seras: No^ erit hic
lenis ciuis princepsue vocandus. Sed dici potius pestifer ille potest.

Which opyneth the gates / to foes vyolent
And casts on houses / great fire lyghtnyng in flame
So iuges forgyueng / deserved punysshment
Subuerteth great towns / and cities excellent
Such ought not be called / princes nor cytyzens
But most mortal foes: and mayteners of syns
yet is it not laufull / in pain to pass measure No^ tame^ in poenis me^suram
excedere sas est Est pulchru^ rebus omnibus esse modum. Suppliciu^ sumens: no^
sis immitis and asper^ Laetus vt alterius tu videare malo.

Or rage in punysshment / as tyran intretable
Sith frail unto trespass / is all humayne nature
A fair mean is measure: in all thing commendable
Wherefore in chastysyng / be not to vngeable
Unmercyfull and sharp / as ioynyng in thy rage
Of another ruin / confusion and dommage
But punysshe as one pensyfe / not wyllyng / but dolent Sed plecte inuieus
veluti sis tactus ad illud Officiu^: et doleas tanta patrasse reum. Qui^ quoque
si plures: ea de^ dat causa noce^tes. No^ illu^ absoluas hunc retinere velis.

As both for to punysshe / constrained to the same
And sorrow that sinners / deserve such punysshement
With so great transgression / hurtyng their soul and name
If many trespassers / be all as one to blame
And in one cause and crime / be all in like culpable
Let not one eschape the / another bide in stable
Let thou not one go fre / an other pay for all No^ poena afficias hos dum tu
munere donas Illos: quod facinus arguit illud idem.

Or these less trangressour / have greattest punysshment
Murder not one wretch / of wit and substance small
Promotyng another / strong thief / more vyolent
This is no good justice / right / law / nor judgment Improbitas eade^ poena^
patiatur eandem.

Let one faut or forfaytethaue punysshment semblable
Be egally to all / right wise, or favorable
Show the not to some / in manner of a mother Nec (...) cuius illius (...).

To some as a enmy / or foe most vyolent
Though thou this day judge / consider that a another
Parchaunce shall to morrow / sit on thy judgment
Endeuoyre the therefore / to be indyfferent
Be not to regorous / nor yet over remys
But judge thou with mercy / like as the matter is
Murder not small thieves / lettyng greatter thieves go Sic fert^ solers quas
nectit aranea telas. Solum pro minimis fila parata feris. Si veniat scrabro
ma^orts ponderis: illas Perfringit telas: dilaceratque leaves.

Without execucyon / for feere / favor or mede
So men say / the spyder / has custom for to do
With her webbes framed / of artyficyall threde
To tangell little flies / only she takes head
But if their come a hornet / a door or greater fly
They break the light webbes / and so for the pass they fre
Her webbes dependant / only inuolueth in Inuoluu^t minimas pe^dentia retia
muscas: Quaru^ cu^ misero murmr vita perit. Sic solet and paup puniri lege
seuera: Si peccat dives lege so lutus abit.

The small little flies / as daily we may se
Whose lives does perysshe / with murmur and small din
Right so the simple wretch / lyueng in pouerte
Has rygour of the law / with most extremyte
But the rich tyran offendyng / passes equity
Fre loused by the law / of wrong custume and ryte
O custom execrable / and grievous preiudyce
So these three fell tyrans / fear / money / and favor
Often times use to break / the balans of justice
The rich fyndyng ryghtwyse / to poor gyueng rygour
These three blideth justice / which thing is great dolor
Which causes poor wretches / their wro^ges to be wayle
While the rich is correct / scant with a fox tail
What dyfference between / a great thief and a small
Forsooth no more but this / to speak I dare be bold
The great sytteth on benche / in costly furs of pall
The small thief at bar / stands tremblyng for cold
The great thieves are laded / with great chains of gold
The small thief with iron: chayned from all refuge
The small thief is iuged / often time the great is judge
If any have trepased / again the wyllyngly Si tibi deliquit quisque non vltio
mayor Delicto fuerit: sufficit esse parem. Si tame^ ignoscas: vindictaque nulla
placebit: Iustior es multo / gratior atque deo.

Be not over hasty / by cruel punysshment
Let not the punysshment / excede the injury
If it be so grievous / it is suffycient
But the faut to pardon / if thou can be content
Than art thou more ryghtwyse / benygne and charitable
And to god thy maker / more dear and acceptable
Mercy makes ma^hynde / to his maker most semblable In famulos etia^ iustu^
seruabis and aequum: Iis iusta impendas: nec nisi iusta petas. Hos credas:
fr^es nobis natura crearit: Vt saeuite ne fas latius esse putes.

And also to thy servants / which lives under the
Be ryghtwyse and equal / in manner reasonable
Give them their duty / and right with all pity
And naught of them require / but right and equity
Think servants be made / our brethren by nature
Wherefore right requires / to treat them in measure
And not without reason / again them for to rage
Them treatyng as beasts / sith they be men as we Abijce: si grauiter tibi
peccant vel miserere: Si leuitir: sapie^s quis queat esse satis?

If their fault be grievous / and done of ill courage
Or of froward malice / cast them away fro the
Or if their fault be small / than of them have pity
Their long faithful service / se thou do not despise
What man is so dyscrete / which always can be wise
But now comprehendyng / all Justyce in one so^me
And breuely concludyng / the bonds of justice
If thou wylt be ryghtwyse / as requires wisdom
Than must thou thy lyueng / order in this wise
Give god laud and glory / and let thine heart arise
Most clefely in his love / contynually brennyng
Avoid his displeasour / do after his byddyng
Next to thy neighbor / or every christen man
Do thou no otherwise / than thou would have gladly
Get goods ryghtwysely / and when thou have the^: than
Love them not over much / but them bestow wisely
To reason of thy soul / make subject thy body
Let him with his lusts: be subject seruytour
Refrayned from folly / by reason governor
Now have we dyscrybed / the bonds of justice Iusticiae postquam fines
referauimus ipsos. Dicamus forte^: magnanimumque virum.

Much thing omittyng / because of breuyte
Which asks long process / in meter to compryse
Wherefore / now procedyng / endeuoyre us shall we
For to dyscrybe a man / of magnanimite
And wryttyng / for to give cure / and solycytude
To show what belongs / to strenght or fortytude
Thus ends the dyscrypcion of the second cardynall Virtue / na myd Justyce /
And begins to be treated De magnanimitate.
of the third Cardynall virtue / called fortytude or magnanimite / or strenght
of mind
Of magnanimite or strenth of mind.
THat man ought be counted / of magnanimite Magnanimum sateor: q: quo teneat^
honestu^: Vltro dura subit q neque saeua pauet: No^ timer hic hoies no^ and
discrimina mortis.

Or of an high mind / and courage valyant
Which in the defendyng / of right and honest
Al hardness indureth / glad / and with mind constant
Wyllyngly submyttyng / himself to death instant
Rather than to recule / from the defense of right
No cruelte dredyng / of tyran / king / nor knight
Such one fears no man / his mind so constant is Quicqd contingat: ser re
paratus adest. No^ aim magnu^ possu^t tormenta: mineque: Vnica sed ratio sancta
monere potest.

He boldly contemns death / and danger mortal
Deuyse the tyran / Nero nor Falaty
Nor all other tyrans / can him naught move at all
He pressed is to suffer / what ever thing does fall
Bold mind is not moved / by thretnyng nor turment
But only by reason / is moved his intent
yet a manly courage / desires not rasshely No^ tamen exposcit te mere
discrimina: quamquam Effugiat timidi nome^ habere viri. Stultius haud quicquam:
quam sese offerre periclis. Cu^ poscit tuto non minus illud idem.

To presume without cause / on doutfull thing and harne
How be it every person / for most part commonly
Would not bear gladly / the name of a cowarde
No thing is more folysshe: than one to ren forward
To do that with danger / with peril and distress
Which myche without peril / be done in quietness
That man is over mad / found / and not worthy rest Est nimiu^ demens:
tra^quilla si quis in vnda Spumiferos aestus optet habere freti.

Which being on the sea / in caume tranquylyte
Desires and prays: for vyolent tempest
For roughe wawes / or fomyng fervor of the se
Not less oursene / but much madder is he
Which may have his pleasour / and mind with patience
yet rennyng to danger / by hasty vyolence
A tyran presumyng / for to subdue justice Qui patria^ i^sultat: vso sat qui
publica ^u^^. No^ vir magnanimus ille putandus erit. Est audax potius:
temerarius: impius amens.

Inuadyng his country / by mad rebellyon
Is not of hye courage / nor valyant in no wise
But traitor and rayser / of insurreccion
A rasshe and bold brybour / sekyng confusion
And while in his quraell / foles their lives spend
His life and his purpose / comes to shameful end
How may a clerk descrybe: a wretch so pestylent Et quicquid possit lingua
refer mali.

His mind has no mercy / but rasshe audacyte
His mad mind amassed / by purpose imprudent
Of his natyfe country / seeks captyuyte
His own shame and friends / extreme calamyte
Such ought not be counted / partyner of fortytude
But tyrannes / trayterours / presumptuous and rude
Nor he is not manly / nor of an high courage Nec vir sortis erit qu^ re^s sua
co^moda sed qui Vim prohibet patriae nec facit ipse suae.

Which suffceth great labor / and peril of this life
For his singular well / and pryuate auantage
But that man / which fights / for his country natyfe
No vyolence doing / to maiden child nor wife
Nor ageyn his country / not being vyolent
Such one has hye courage / and mind magnificent
The mind has no praysyng / nor laud worthy doutlesse Nulla animi laus e^

Nor that deed is counted / of no preemynence
Where justice is not gyde / where wants ryghtwysnesse
Where health of our country / is voyded from presence
And where the common well / fyndeth not sure defense
Only a ryghtwyse man / of just and plain intent
Ought to be called strong / of mind magnyficent
No man save a lover / of just symplycyte Magnanimi* et fortis nome^ habere

Without fraud or faynyng / boldly supportyng right
Ought for to have the name / of magnanimite No^ te facto^^ delectet fama

Let not thine own deeds / be pleasant in thy sight
All if the common fame / them laud with words light
Consider well thy self / if they be without blame
Trust more to that try all / than to the common fame
Let that only please the / and only the delight Sed per se placita sit been
facta tibi. Magnanimus claris in gestis ponit honestum. Et populi voces
respicit ille parum. No^ magni e^ animi: qui vulgi pendet ab ore.

A man of bold spyryt / consydereth honest
And in honest deeds / which many does profit
Them self clear co^mendyng / has he felycyte
Right little regardyng the voice of co^monte
He has no bold courage / which only does depend
On mouth of the commons / his deeds to commend
But he is most manly / which in his deeds can Sed dare qui potuit* quod cupit
ipse sibi.

Give surely to himself / all that he does require
Not caryng the praises / of woman / child or man
Who that ouermoche / does great names desire Qui nimiu^ tribuit tiltulis* et
queritat illos: Ille nimis vanus: and pue ^ilis homo est.

Orcoueyteth vain tytyls / of honor to conquyre
He should not be counted / a man of granyte
But a chyldysshe person: ensuyng vanyte
It namely belongs / to man of bold courage Est animi iprimis magnites
spernere cunctas Externas: nimiu^ quas rude vulgus amat. Res humilis spernens
animus petit ardua magnus. Quicquid habet tellu^ se putat esse minus.

All vain things outward / to despise utterly
Countyng all thing mundayne / incertayne and volage
Which rude common people / most loves commonly
Thus a valyant mind / all way mounteth on hye
Despysyng low things / thing erthely in no wise
Can content his courage / nor noble mind suffyse
All erthes contents / what ever is here on ground
Is less than his courage / nor can not content No^ oculus quicqd cer nit vel
dextra tangit / Sed que me^te capit: ar dua: et alta putat.

Such treasour as his eye / beholds here abound
Or whateuer he touches / is not suffycient
yet seeks he in mind / for thing more excellent
Thing endless reuoluyng / and castyng in memory
Conteynyng these tryfels / of things transtytory
I count him much greater / than emperor or king Qui spernit ^ras: ai^o
coelestia tangens. Illo non vullus (vt puto) mayor erit. Atqui magnus homo est
quisqs versat^ in ^m^s? Et neque de terra tollit ad alta caput?

Which in mind atteyneth / to thing celestyall
Utterly dyspysyng / caduke and erthly thing
Though he in this world / possess no thing at all
But on the other party / what man would great him call
Which only reuolueth / low thing and tra^sytory
Not lyftynge his reason / from ground to perelesse glory
What person would deny: but it where worthy thing Quis negit esse hois magni
virtute me^e^i: Dignum cu^ summo rege tenere locum? Ergo non magnus: sed
maximus ille ^eretur: Qui summi meru^t a^ licus esse dei.

And a great man's deed / by virtue to purchase
A great room or office / with emperor or king
Than is he much greater / which has the gift of grace
With the king eternal: to purchase him a place
With angels for to reygne / hye in the heuynly hall
Where is endless solace / and joy perpetual
What man would deny him / both bold and valyant Quis negit ee^ viru^ for tem:
qui viribus v^be^ Et lo^ga magnas obsidione capit? Ergo no^ ^ortis: sed erit
fortissimus ille: Qui sistet capta victor in arce poli.

Which by long siegyng / strength and audacyte
Takes great Cytyes / well peopled and puysant
Well stored of riches / and armor in plente
Than much more valyant / mighty and strong is he
Which as an ouercomer / and mighty co^querour
Has won (by his merytes the hye and heavenly tour)
No travail nor labors / what so ever they be No^ homine^ magnu^ te^ rent
quicu^que labores: Vt ta^de absoluat quod been cedit opu^.

Can move a bold courage / by fearful fantasy
Thing laudable to leave / but that boldly will he
Persevere and proceed / concludyng finally
Warkes well attempted / and first begin wisely
The bold naught abides / till all wisely be done
For well he consydreth / that the end gives corone
And naught can be surely praised before the end Sic te no^ pigeat pulsa re
palacia coeli: Vt referet faciles iani tor ipse fores. No^ quenquam tenuit
pulsantem ^anitor altus. Et nulli no^ dat: si modo iusta petit.

Therefore he there unto / contendeth constantly
So / be not thou weary / but busely entende
At the heuynly palace / to knock perseuerantly
Than shall the porter opyn / the gates finally
For none he repelleth / which bide knocking with might
Nor none he denies / which asks thing of right
Wherefore have ye done cesse not / persevere knock and stand Quare age: no^
vnquam tu brachia fessa remitta^ Quando quide^ mox te praemia certa manent.
Palma^ fine feres: ad finem pergito namque.

Remyt not thine arms: by knocking fitigate
Abide? for thy meryt / anon is sure at hand
Thy reward is instant / thou shall not be frustrate
Before the vyctory / no man is laureate
At endyng shall thou have / palm / vyctory: and mede
Than have in thy voyage / persevere and proceed
Proceed unto the end / in storms and tempest Aequore decurso: digna corona
datur, Nec fine^ nimium tibi credas esse remotum. Cu^ minime reris: saepe
propinquus adest.

Ron over the streams / with sure ship and constant
Thou shall after travail / com to the haven of rest
And sure port of pleasour / and glory tryumphant
Nor think not that the end / or port is far dystant
Let no such suspeccion: of long delay the grieve
The port is often at hand / long or thou would believe
A great mind dysdayneth / in bondage for to be No^ animus magnus ser uit: sed
liber ab omni Est vitio recti: perpe^unsque comes.

But from all manner vice / and inconvenience
It self it preserves / at lyberte and fre
As soon as first mocyon / of vile concupiscence
Attempteth him in mind / for to commit offense
Anon he dysdayneth / such vile temptacion
His lusts refraynyng / with brydell of reason
The very first mouyng / or temptyng unto syn
He chaseth from his mind / and does the same subdue
By reason well nothing / that if it entered in
And rests any space / soon after might ensue
Some pleasour or consent / or deed again virtue
Therefore he rests / beginning with all might
And always for gydes / takes reason and right
He suffers not vile lust / nor blind lascyuyte Nec patit^: luxus superet
turpisque libido. Sed superat sensus for c^or ipse suos. Seruitiu^ maius no^
est / nec turpius vllum:

To subdue his reason / wit / or intellygence
But boldly he brydleth / all wild enormyte
Much strongly subduyng / carnal concupyscence
For certesse no bondage / nor vile obedience
Is fouler to mankind / first fourmed reasonable
Than to be subdued / to vices detestable
And lie as outlawed / in mind and in reason Quam quo sub vitijs: men's
religata ^acet. Libertas animi vera e^ que^ nulla voluptas Imperio cogit:
seruitioque premit.

Under grievous yoke of vice / or syn unkind
His carnal lust reigning / above dyscresion
But certainly there is / no lyberte of mind
Save where no vile lusts / nor vice does reason bind
Where no lust oppresses / the reason in bondage
There is true lyberte / not subject to seruage
A man thus endued / with so great liberte Nil admirat^: nisi quod videatur
honestum: Nil: nisi quod semper: quod propri^que manet.

Commends no pleasour / unstable nor volage
That only which sounds / to laud and honest
He prayseth and laudeth / of his most hye courage
He forseth not favor / of iuuent nor of age
But that which abides just / and contynuall
He laudeth and prayseth / or else naught at all
A bold mind is constant / one manner man always Casibus aduersis co^sta^^
subcumbere nescit: Tanquam si semp res sua salua foret.

Not shrynkyng for sorrow / nor hard aduersyte
But boldly he bears / troubles of every fray
With stout port and stomach / in manner / as though he
Felt none aduersyte / loss / nor necessyte
No chance can him chang / so bold is his courage
Dysdaynyng for to feel / mysfortune or dommage
That bold worthy courage / which thinks for to have Sed nihil aduersi
ce^sebit maximus ille: Oia qui in me^te credit habere bona.

His hole treasour in heart / and all his good in mind
And not in his body / as in a mortal grave
Such one in cernall troubles / can no dyspleasour find
Nor none adverse fortune / reputeth he unkind
These chaungeable chances / of mysfortune mundayne
Are to him assured / no dyspleasour nor pain
He only contains / all goodness in his mind Ille aute^ solus co^plectitur
omnia mente. Pectore cu^ Christus nocte dieque sedet. Aspectu^ seruat: grauitas
que^ vestit: (...) o^nat. Nec trepidat verbis: La^gu^diusque so not.

Which bears in his heart / christ Jesu day and night
This man has grauyte / naught can his reason blind
So christ has inclered / his mind with inward light
His countenance is one / in every man's sight
No more faint nor fearful / is he / of his langage
In most grievous chances / than in chief auantage
He shows no semblance / in word nor countenance Non magni est toruo^ oc^os
vultusque minace^ Sed magis e^ mitis ^ro^tis habere decus.

Of inward dysplesour / his courage is so sure
And certesse / it not seems / a great man of constaunce
To show cruel eyes / or look again nature
But rather with vysage: and countenance demure
These grym thretnyng lokes / betoken no fortytude
But rather a proud heart / unkind boystuous and rude
The strong is nattryed / nor proved by iesture Non eteni fortis gestu
vultuque probatur: Sed facito: atque aia sit mihi magnus homo.

By face nor countenance / but one may try and find
What man has hye courage: and boldness of nature
By his worthy deeds / and stablenes of mind
Many one is fearful / and cowarde of his kind
Counterfaytyng outward / a lions countenance
Unstable in his deeds / without perseueraunce
If thou be in office / or great auctoryte No^: quia tu populi verearis far
repulsas: Propterea res e^ publica agenda minus.

Be not more remyse / do not thy duty less
Anenst the common well / all if thou fere to be
Soon after deposed / by commons unkindness
The nature of commons: is roted in rudeness
And very hard it is / to please a multitude
yet for the common well / fly not solicitude
Leave thou not thy country / when battle is instant No^ datria^ liquas quia
sit tibi pugna futura.

But boldly prepare the / for it to bide and fight
Extreme need best proves / a courage valyant
Thou can not better dye / than fyghtyng for the right
Than: need most requires to show thy force No^ ali^ fortis noscier ipse
potes.

Thou can not be known strong / nor of bold courage
Save in bydyng danger / and peril of damage
How no covetous wretch can have the true virtue of magnanimite.
A wretch / whom the fassion / and hunger execrable Praeterea / que^ facra
fames: et forma monetae Ceperit: haud magnus imo pusillus homo est. Torme^^et
quamuis scelera ta pecunia paruos: Esse tame^ magnis illa molestia inquit.

Of gold or vile money / has blinded in intent
May not be called great / but small and miserable
For though this cursed coin / small wretches does tourment
yet can it not trouble / a mind magnificent
A bold mind consydereth it / gotten with great pain
Saved or kept with fear / with sorrow lost again
No man is more simple / vile / nor of base courage Nil minuu^ est a^o: nil est
angustius illo: Qui seruit nu^mis: cui domina^tur open. Ille aute^ est fortis:
qui scit contemnere pauper: Diui^ias animo no^ cupiendo suo.

Nor no mind more pynched / or drouned in dolor
Than he / which of money / is kept under bondage
Of whom wretched treasour / is lord and governor
But that simple person / is worth a conqueror
Which can despise riches / content with pouerte
Coveting no riches / nor vain prosperyte
Such one / in beholdynge the vain solicytude
Of covetous catyfes / and wretches of the ground
He laugheth unto scorn / their life and manners rude
Aduertyng to what care / and labors they be bound
Which does all the judgment / of their reason confound
Of rest them bereuyng / of treasour while they think
To sleep thy entende not / nor yet to meat nor drink
Thus while they get riches / false / frail / and fugytyfe
These wretches to them self / than tyra^nes more unkind
Lose rest / fame / and frenshyp: and also the sweet life
All this / a bold courage reuolueth often in mind Aut si dives habet: qui sic
partitur amicis:

Wherefore no such furour / can his hye reason blind
But if he have plente / of riches and treasour
He parts it a broad / to needful with honor
Unto his poor fryndes / which have necessite
He parts and spredeth his treasour ioyously
Delytyng for to have / such prossybylyte
To many men to be / socour and subsedy Subsidio vt multis gaudeat esse viri^.

He studyeth with treasour / eternal bliss to bye
And lovers in this life / as thing more commendable
Than all Cresus riches / of gold innumerable
How common is the clause / and sentence of Pyrrus Qua vulgat viros ite^
sententia Pir^hi est* Cu^ redimit captos sau cia roma suos. Inquit enim Pyrrhus
p^ciu^ numerari vole^ti.

Of most famous auctours / counted of dignyte
Which unto the romans / made noble answer thus
When they came to him / with treasour in plente
Their captyues to redeem / which in prison had he
While thynbassadours told / their rau^sone in gold
Pyrrus thus aswerde / with courage fre and bold
your gold I demand not / no silver will I feel Non auru^ posco: non mihi
dona dabis: Ce^^emus ferro no^ auro cauponantes Contractare auru^ / nos decet
arma viros.

No gift shall ye give / your treasour I dispyse
Contend we with armor / of yren and of stele
Not with gold nor gifts / as tauerners have gyse
Merchants / and other / ensuyng couetyse
Icsemeth vile wretches / to handell coin and gold
Bright armor besemeth / / men valiant and bold
For certain this answer / seemed so noble a king Dignu^ rege quide^ verbu^
genus aeacidarum: Ostendit magnum viri bus / atque animo: Nec minor ipse animo
Curi dentate fu^sti Cum tibi samnires aurea dona darent.

Of Eacus / worthy to come of hye lynage
Of whom this said Pyrrus / had his birth and spryng
This word / well him proved: strong and of bold courage
And thou also Curious / both sad sober and sage
Thy self well declared / of mind / as strong and bold
When the samnytes / presented the with gold
As thou syttyng ydell / was dryeng by the fire
Small rapes / as man simple / by riches setting naught Torrebas modicum (...)*
pas tu lentus ad ^gne^: Explicuit samnis cum sua dona clien^.

One of the samnytes / subject to thine empire
Laid forth goldy gifts / which he had to the brought
By signs which he saw / reputyng in his thought
By such manner gifts / the greatly to content
By cause thou resembled / as poor and indigent
But what answer gave thou? forsooth a wise and bold Malo equidem dixti fi
guli coenare catino / Quam fuluis: tecu^ mu nera missa refer. No^ auru^
volumus: potius sed habentibus auru^

Saying / I had leauer thus homely for to dyne
In an erthyn platter / than in a dysshe of gold
Return with thy gifts / naught I demand of thine
What need I thy gifts / since thou thy self art mine
Of governors of gold / we wylbe governors
Rather than of gold: or other vain treasours
This answer besemed / a mind magnificent
And a man establed / in magnanimite Esse super volumus: hoe ^upimusque magis.

But again return we / unto our first e^tent
A bold mind in labor: most diligent must be Corpore sunt etia^ sub^unda
pericula rerum. Sunt res difficiles: im^ probiorque labor.

In thing of most peril / and most dyfficulte
Where things be most h^^o / there must thou to prevail
Chefely put thy body / to labor and travail
yet though the thing be needful / go not thereto ra^hly No^ tamen haec temere
sed rectius ante vide^ du^. Quid ratio asse^tit quoth fieri ve negat. Non etenim
te^tet sese ma^ora fuitque Vi^ibus vt coeptu^ turpe relinquat opus,

But before consider / what way is right and sure
What reason affermeth / and what it does deny
Attempt nothing passing / thy wit / might / and nature
Nor whose end and process / is unto the obscure
A wise man by reason / consydereth well this same
But foles often begin / and leave again with shame
And namly some trustyng / in them self to greatly Saepe nimis fidens sibi
magna negotia sumit: Quae neque cum perigat: dedecus inde refert. Attamen and
caveat: nimiu^ du^ prouidet omne: Ne visus trepida^ quaerere velle fugam.

Begin often great things / wenyng to win them name
But when all their purpose / proceeds fro wardly
Instead of co^mendyng / they get them rebuke and shame
Another thing beware / which also wynneth blame
So long do not all thing / before provide and cast
That thou seem to leave all (as co ward) at the last
Better dye with honor / than live in worldly shame Nempe mori praestat: quam
turpe^ viuere vitam: Seruitio mors est ante ferenda viris. Non certes armis:
nisi cu^ certare necesse est. Namque ferum nimis est conseruisse manus.

And lead the life dishonest / and foul / till utter age
A bold noble courage / desyryng worthy name
Would much rather dye / than live in vile bondage
Contend not in battle: if thou be sad and sage
Without need constrayne the / or hard necessyte
To shede bold is brutall / and beastly cruelte
It seems not mankind / but cruel beasts wode
Which of noble reason / parteners can not be Nunquam suscipias bellu^ nisi
pacis amore. Sed pax nil fraudis / nil habeatque doli.

To delight in shedyng / echone of others blood
Begin never betayle / as much as is in the
But for to love peace / concord / and unity
And when peace is compact / and sure confederate
Let no fraud nor trayson: nor gyle it vyolate
Nothing in a great man / can be more commendable Dignius in magno nihil est /
quam darcere victis. In quo naturae co^uenit ille dei. No^ tantae est laudis vi
debellare superbos: Quantae est eleme^tem se: placidumque dare.

Than to spare his foes / brought in obedyence
To great god eternal / this man is most semblable
Less laud is to subdue / by force and vyolence
Than to show thine ennemy / thy mercy and clemence
More laud is to pardon / and spare wretches subject
Than proud great rebellers / by battle to correct
Among all the virtues / ascrybed to Caesar Inter caesareas virtures prima
refertur: Quod placidus victus ciuibus ille fuit, Magnanimum mitem fecit natura
leonem Prostratis: pueris exiguisque feris.

This one is renomed / most chief and pryncypall
That he was merciful / not more in peace than war
Sparyng the Cytezins / to him subject and thrall
All if the bold lion / be cruel and brutall
To such ^s be prostrate / of nature is he mylde
And under like manner / both to small beast and child
Thou should not co^tende / nor fight against thy fo No^ nisi praemonito du
du^ conflixeris hosti: Na^que animos timidos indicat ipse dolus. No^ odio
quenquam: nec sis liuore secutus. Hoc eteni angustis me^ tibus esse solet.

Except thou have somewhat / plain warned him before
For gyle proves a mind / co ward and faint also
A false fearful heart / by naught is proved more
Than fraudfull assautes / and vengeance tosore
Purse we non with hatred / with malice / nor envy
These bind thyn own mind / most straight in mysery
If any have grieved the / with outher word or deed Si qs te verbis: vel factis
laesit iniquis. Hu^c tecum reputa nil nocuisse tibi. Sed tantu^ mentem dicas
habuisse nocendi: Et mente^ optatum no^ habuisse suum.

Against right or reason / as oftyn time may fall
To such a wretched parsons / lyueng take good head
And count thy self by him / nothing grieved at all
But say thus / as seems / a man substancyall
This man would have hurt me / but god is good and kind
Not grauntyng him power / nor might after his mind
His mind was to grieve / now has it none effect
Unto his own tourment / now tourneth his delight
And more cause have other / his malice to suspect
And certainly to sleep / that man has small respyte
Which tourneth and wakeneth / when every fley does byte
Many grefes happen / whom pacyent scilence
Much better subdueth / than open vyolence
For certain no person / is greatly hurt in deed Na^ nisi se laedat: certo
non laeditur vllus. Namque alius mente^ tan gere nemo potest. Cumque vlcisce^di
fuerit tibi facta potestas: Hoc pro vindicta sit potuisse satis.

Without he hurt him self / by faint thoughes unkind
Dispyse / though thy body / in diverse parts blede
Without thine own consent / no man can grieve thy mind
Thy wrongs to revenge / when thou shall power find
Let this full suffice the / to have thy foe subject
And to have such might / his malice to correct
Take only such power / for utter punysshment Vltio nulla quide^ ma^ori cedet
honori Quam tibi quae spreta quaeque remissa fuit. Occulto quenquam no^ carpes
ipse susurro. Sed / si quem argue^is: aggrediare palam.

Thou can not revenge thy wrong / in nobler wise
Than when of thy foes / thou may have thine intent
To pardon their trespass / and their malice dispyse
Of secret detractours / ensue thou not the gyse
Blame thou no man absent / why speryng secretly
If thou have cause to blame / assail him openly
A mind only grounded / on right and equite Magnanimu^ faciet ta^tu^ men's
conscia recti. Men^ pura: and simplex / intemerata sides.

And it self perceyuyng ryghtwyse and innocent
Of spyryt may bebolde / with magnanimyt^
These things make namely / a mind magnyficent
A pure mind and simple / a right and plain intent
With just faith and lyueng / defiled at no time
With none enorme manners / nor grievous spot of crym^
But vile and foul sins: and vices of lyueng At trepidu^ facient sor des and

torpet sermidine tristi. Na^ quicu^que sine est cri mine: quid metuat?

Makes man be fearful / sad: heavy and pensyfe
For that wretch suspecteth / and dredeth every thing
Which is hard oppressed / with his own sinful life
A pure heart and clean mind / have this prerogatyfe
Never to be sluggysshe / by heavy dread or fear
Who is without trespass: what can him hurt or dear
Or what has he to dread: no manner thing be sure An morte? munus sibi quam
natura parauit? Per qua no dubious regna beata subit? An vel suppliciu^? cui,
non ille dolorem Sentit: du^ sanans vul nera: Christus adest?

What should he dread of death / it is ineuytable
The general dotye: and trybute of nature
By whom he has passage: to life intermynable
What should he dread tourment / of tyran intretable
Of whom he not feleth / displeasour / hurt nor grefe
Sith our lord is ready / his wounds to relefe
What matter should he dread? what can him fear or move Quid time at que
Christus amat? quem virgo tuetur? Numina cui coeli cuncta benigna fauent?

Whom no true troubles / nor vices can oppress
Whom Christ his dear master / does both defend and love
Whom the glorious vyrgyn / eternal empress
Defends / and is ready / to help in all distress
Whom all heuynly spirits / does favor and defend
With his foes ready / all season to contend
Who could in time passed / these holy martyrs fear Martyribus potuit qui^
quo^da^ infer timore^* Vincere ta^ magnos q potuere viro^? No^illos reges

Or move their great constance / from faith and true believe
They princes ouercam / but no prince couoe them dear
No king could them change / overcome / nor remeue
No tyran nor tourment / coud them in minds grieve
All if their frail bodies / often suffered utter pain
Cherat / their mind constant / had utterly disdain
Accused of peoples / and false rulers were some Praesidibus cora^iuuenes
puerique senesque ^t tragilis mulier non hab^ere metum.

Some cast to wild beasts / in pieces to be rent
But no manner manace / nor pain could them overcome
Weak women / children / old fathers / and Juuent
Before cruel prouostes / standing at judgment
And with them young vyrgyns / seeing their wounds blede
Of tyrannes nor tourment / had nouther fear nor dread
No bows nor darts / nor other like atmour Non arcus: non arina: neci
districta / togufque / No^ ^aculis saeue / verbi busque manus. No^ carcer no^

Nor bright swerdes drawn / to their deedly tourment
No spears nor fyers / kyndled them to devour
No prison no scourges / no pytche of lothly sent
No thretnyng of prison / nor utter punysshment
No hunger nor thurst: nor fetuenty oil brennyng
Could move them to change / their faith nor pure lyueng
No thretnyng nor suffraunce / of waters vyolence Munera / nec regni parts:
promissaque regum. Coniugia: in turpe^ no^ pepulere fugam.

Could change their sad purpose / establed by wisdom
No gifts nor treasour / of greatest opulence
No promise of part / of empire / nor kingdom
Nor kings marriage / could these martyrs overcome
Nor their holy purpose move / nor inclyne to flight
In mind were they stre^ghted / so sure with heavenly sight
Not only the parents / saw their children in flame
With chere glad and ioconde / in heart and countenance Nec tantu^ natos laeti
valuere parents Spectare in fla^mis* erucibusque suos

But many their own children / exorted to the same
And for no short tourment to fly from their constau^ce
O marvelous minds / great perseueraunce
The mother has often times / with voice magnificent
Exorted her young children / to peynes and tourment
The wife has exorted / her husband in like wise Quin magis infantes genitrix
hortata tenellos. Et frater fratre^: sponsaque cara virum. Quis possit scto^s
morientes dicere victos? Victores potius morre fuere sua.

And one brother another / strenghted to martyrdom
And for our lords cause / all tourment to despise
But what man of lernyng / of virtue / or wisdom
Would say that these martyrs / thus dyeng were overcome
But rather in the mids / of all their tormentours
They stood not overcome / but lyker conquerours
The Juge or tourmentour: by cruel tyranny
Might subdue the body / sometime unto tourment
But the mind perseuered: establed constantly Fortius aut maius nihil est qua^
vincere mu^du^.

In the faith and lauds: of god omnypotent.
Thus were they by peynes / and mind magnyfycent
And by death subduers / of their own corpse carnal
Of tyrans / tormentours: and fendes infarnall
The world / and bayne pleasours / subdued they also
Dispysyng all pleasour / of things transytory

On earth can no man find / more worthy vyctory
In over coming earth / they wan eternal glory
And where men supposed them / to have been overcome
They ouercam / both men / earth / and the hye kingdom
For certain lord Jesu / who thus may dye for the Nil parit selix homini
pariter que beatum: Nil pariter dulce quam tibi Christ mori.

To him can nothing be / of more beatytude
Of more parfyte swetnesse / of more felycyte
More ioconde / more joyous / nor yet more gratytude
Alas we blind wretches / are we not dull and rude
Seeing our redemar / endure for us such pain
And no pain nor dolor: to endure for him again
Not only may we dye: and suffer martydrome Nec ta^tum gladio* sed viui
possumus ipsi Hoc tibi conte^pto cor pore Christ mori. Qui gladio mori^ tantum
semel occidat ille. Occidit hic saepe: q sua membra domat.

By tourment of tyran / by sword / water or flame
But lyueng we may dye / if we our self overcome
This vile corpse dispysyng: and lusts of the same
Who dies with sword / but ones him self does rame
By death / but who tameth his members corporal
Is daily mortifyed / by death contynuall
Nor this death is granted / not unto every man Nec datur ha^c cunctis gladij
co^tinger^ morte^ Qui cupiunt: gladius gratia summa dei est*

Which coueyte for to dye: for Christ our savior
Some would feign be martyrs / by sword / but they ne can
That is a specy all grace / of our dear redemptour
But this said other death / to vanquysshe all error
To tame this frail body / and lust to mortyfy
To every one wyllyng: is granted co^mouly
But whom Christ vouchsaueth / to dye by martyrdom Quem fuerit Christus
dignatus morte perire Co^stmile / certe e^ proxi ^usille deo.

Of tyrannes tourment / no doubt is / but he is
Next joined unto god / above in his kingdom
In endless fruicion / of his eternal bliss
And next them innocents / which have not done a mysse
But not without merit / and endless joy is he
Which him self subdueth / by magnanymyte
Wherefore have done redar / address the to virtue
In whose cause and quarrel / be bold to stand and fight
Thy blind carnal lusts / of frail members subdue
Be ready for to dye / for Justyce / treuth and right
Dispyse all injury / so seems Christ's knight
Subdue this false world / it is but vanyte
Than think thy self stabled / in magnanymyte
What are these passions / of troubles transytory
But clouds consumyng / and means for to call
Man from worldly folyes / to bliss and endless glory
Make not double damage / of one displeasour small
Be strong trust no tempest / can last contynuall
After sorest storms / most clerest air wese
After aduers fortune / shyneth prosperyte
Who can not abide the one / shall not attain the other
The sour sauce is served / before meat deynteous
Joy sauced is / with pain / remember this my brother
Myxt with mysauenture / be chances prosperous
This life is resembled / a byldyng ruynous
Now shaked with the wind / again now reparate
So fares by troublesi and chances fortunate
The children of Israel / passed first the reed see
And thyrty year wandered in savage wilderness
In land of promyssion / or they / in rest could be
And long time of battle / endured hard distress
At last were they stabled / in rest and quietness
So god will his servants / here in this life chastyce
Before he receive them / to rest in paradyse
Than have done / take confort / be of stout courage
Have hope / that these troubles / are ernest (trust to me)
Of solace and confort / in endless heritage
Make light thing of labors / by magnanymyte
Aduert all thing mundayne / has mutabylyte
Save virtue / well roted / within a stedtast mind
Nothing is here constant / all tourneth as the wind
Nothing is here constant / naught permanent at all
Ever: perils passed / are pleasour for to tell
A man on ground restyng / can much lower fall
Let hope and bold spyrite / all mysery excel
Aduert what is written / plainly in the gospel
He must trauers troubles which will our lord ensue
Renounce the frail world / and his own self subdue
Our muse has remained / enough as thinks me ^ a^ satis in magnis ais
versata thalia es: Nu^c reliquum propera sancta re^erre pede.

In the shape / descrybyng / of stout perseverance
Or payntyng the pycture / of magnanymyte
God gydyng / our style: now let us forth auaunce
To discrybe the virtue / of comely Temperaunce
But favorable redar / think not pain / but delight
Read forth / for I promyt / both pleasour and profit.
Thus ends ye description of ye third Cardynall ver tue / named Magnanymyte
or fortytude / or strenghte of De Temperancia.
great mind: And here after enseweth the description of the fourth and last
Cardynall virtue / called moderacion or Temperaunce.
Of Temperaunce.
BEfore have we treated / of minds inuyncyble Diximus inuictas me^te: nunc
far modestas Et locus: and tempus: pro positumque monet. Qui cohibet motus:
and mi seruatque decorum Dictis: and factis: is moderatus erit.

Now place / time / and purpose exorteth our scripture
In meter for to write: as plain as is possible
Of minds temperate / well manerde and demure
Who brydeleth his lusts / well orderyng his iesture
Keeping comeliness / in deed / word and countenance
Such one ought be counted / a man of temperaunce
Therefore / that thou may be such one: of governance Ergo / vt sis talis:
tecu^ tua vota tependas. Et po^lia persequere: caetera missa face.

By comely temperance / thy deeds to dispose
Thy mocyons of mind / note well in remembrance
Whether they be honest / or nothing to purpose
If they be laudable than after them compose
Thy manners and lyueng / if thy desires be
Repugnant to reason / than utterly them fle
Those only be good desires / clean and sure Su^t bona: quae simplex tantu^
natura requirit. No^ ea: quae fastu^: ambicioque iubet.

Which nature requires / obeyeng to reason
Not they / whom haute purpose / making reason obscure
Desires of proud mind / end blind ambicion
One having him own self: in his possession
Him rulyng by reason / does not much require
Such him self possessyng / naught forther will desire
For much he not needs / which of himself is lord Non eget hic multis: q
se possiderit ipsum. Qui se possideat: se putat esse satis. Omnibus et rebus
praedictes semp abundat: Esse vel absque opibus dicet ille nequit.

But himself he counts / riches sufficient
Who can himself govern / in deed / in thought / and word
Abundantly is ever: great / rich / and opulent
In all needful treasour / and never indigent
What man / would afferme / such one without treasour
Which of all his deeds: is lord and governor
Thus every man may make / himself full of riches Na^ se quisque potest per se
praestare beatum / Si modo possideat omne quod intus habet: Cui sua no^ sat
su^t: aliud sed quaeritat extra:

Replenysshe him with wealth / joy / and felycyte
His own inward gifts / if he can well possess
Stablyng his desires / on thing of honest
But miserable / careful and ever nedy / is he
Which can not welde himself / subduyng all error
With himself not content / sekyng outward treasour
Which thinks not enough / the treasour of his mind Ille miser semper:
semper egenus erit. Na^ numero quamuis habe at sibi plurima dives: Plura tame^
multo semper habere cupit.

But of outward riches seeks / himself for to store
For certain / the rich / is so gredy and blind
That though he have plenty / himself he cou^teth pore
And evermore in mind / does coueyt much more
As his coin increases / and treasour temporal.
His gredy appetyte / increases still with all*
Forsooth he possesses himself / most parfytely Sese ante^ totu^ (ni fallor)
possidet ille: Qui sane e^ me^tis: quique videnda videt. Corpore ceu totus
ce^setur: et integre esse. Omnia q validus integra membra gerit.

And each part to reason / is due obedient
Which is of hole mind / beholding inwardly
All things to be seen / to right expedynt
Such one himself rules / by parfyte Jugement
And is called parfyte / as men him perfyte call
Which has his hole members / and pertes corporal
But contrary wise / this part to understand Contra: no^ totus cense tur
lumine cas^us. Nec si cui nasus: pesque: manusque deest. Si etia^: si cui
caligant lumina mentis: Mersus in errores non sibi totus ad^st.

That man is not parfyte / which is noselesse or blind
Or wants any part / as arm / leg / foot / or hand
In like wise that person / is not perfyte of mind
Which one thing parfourmeth / another left behind
Or whose light of reason / is drowned in derknesse
Or whom sundry errors / inuoluyng does oppress
Enough can it not be / the to defend from ire
And to be subdued / of beastly glotony
What vayleth to avoid / frail Uenus ragyng fire
And overcome to be / with malice and envy
What helps patience / where reygneth lechery
Or what helps meekness / where reygneth couetyse
An hole mind and parfyte / subdueth every vice
And stryueth to vaynquysshe / all error crymynall Ergo te habe primum necres
perquir^ remotas. Pars tibi cu^ desit ^xima quaeque tua est:

From his mind excludyng / all branches of myssyueng
For this cause overcome / thy desire first of all
And thy self possess thou / as was my first byddyng
Than care not / nor seek not / for no farther thing
It is not a tokyn / of man discrete nor wise
To seek outward things / and inward to dispyse
The prudent man spares / no treasour temporal
To drive from his body / sickness / and every sore Vt sese prude^s habeat^ de
corpore morbos Pellit: and assidue noxia cuncta cauet.

To have in possession / his lymmes corporal
That keeps good dyete / when he is hole before
Than should thou dispyse / vain treasour mykell more
And all outward things / utterly dispyse
Thy treasour of virtue / to put in exercise
Behold what abusion / subdueth frail mankind Quisna^ co^sulto sumit
potatque venenum? In foueam quis se praecipitanter agit? Quin si quis biberit
c^ su: vel fraud cicutam. Antidotu^ medicos pro tinus ille petit.

All seeks for socour / of peynes corporal
But very few or none / regard the soul or mind
Let se / who receives with will poison mortal
Or in a pyt profounde / wyllyngly wyllfall
But rather / if he take a drink in toxicate
Soon does he seek for physyke / and aid investigate
If any brake his leg / by sudden adventure Sicui crus fractu^: subi^ to
conducit aliptem. Quin oculis lippis et medicina sua est. Quod magis est dicam
claudus si icedit ac^li^ Continuo fabrum tu proprio or^ vocas.

Anon abone setter / he hyreth suddenly
Or if his sight him fail / or gynne to ware obscure
Nature him constrayneth / to seek for remedy
But yet shall I touch / one thing more largely
If an ass go lame mentary not a weke
But straight to the smyth / for remedy they seek
This cure thou co^mittest / for help of the body Cut quoque: si mo^bus sen
sum mente^que grauauit: No^ adh^bes cura^^ resti tuisse quae tibi^

If disease have grieved / thy reason and thy mind
Why sekest not socour / for help and remedy
Namely sith the same / so easy is to find
Alas man thou slepyst / thy reason is to blind
Thou sholdest of thy mind / have much greater cure
Than of thy frail body / a sack of vile ordure
Now much more the mind / excels thy body Ho^ etenim cura e^ mayor tibi
me^tis habe^da: Quo superat corpus nobilitate sua.

In noblesse of nature / and emynent valor
So much more thou sholdest / for it find remedy
When it by thy folly: is wounded by error
Consider of thy soul / the excellent honor
It has shape and image / of god omnypotent
Thy body is mortal / as beast / or vile ^ument
Than puruey for thy soul / thy vile body dispyse
Why have thou such plesour / to lose so great treasour Quid iuuat in ta^tos
illam mersare labores: Semper vt ancipiti se rotet illa malo* Cur illa in
fla^mis noctesque: diesque fatigas*

In so great vain labors / drownyng thy mind this wise
It tournyng as a well / in vices every hour
And in doutfull damage / inuoluyng and error
What meanest to tourment / it night and day in fire
And most fervent flames / of thine unclean desire
Say / what delight have thou to lose without profit
Thy dear inward jewel / and pryncipall treasour Et perdis melius: quod
potiusque tenes? Impius e^ nimiu^: nimiu^ crudelis: et asper: In ^e qui
propria^ ^ij^i^ ipse manus.

Unkynde is thy pleasour / O vain is this delight
Unpytefull art thou / and cruel tormentour
Which / thyn own proper mind / thus drownest in error
If he be much cruel / which does his body quell
Who kylleth his own soul / is much more cruel
Wherefore do thou co^tende / tynuolue and wrap thy mind Quid tanti^ certas
inuoluere retibus illam: Scilicet vnde vole^^ ex plicuisse nequis? En quatitur
vigila^s cu it is: quatiturque quiesces

In snares and great nets / of thought / labor / and pain
From which at thy pleasour / thou shall no means find
The same to lyberte / for to get forth again
Behold it is troubled: wakyng with cures bayne
And nyghtly when nature / demands quyete rest
Thy mind most with cures / is tossed and oppressed
As a ship is tossed / in vehement tempest
So prycked is the mind / inquyete by furour Acta velut stimulis irrequiet^
furit. Tu tanqua^ tor^or: tan qua^ Bellona flagello: Persequeries s^uus illa
misella fugit.

Thou chasest / it fleyth / in ragyng without rest
Thy mind is miserable / thy self art tourmentour
With (...)ge it persuyng / and lasshyng with ^ygour
As cru^^l Bellona / the goods of battle
So thy woeful mind / thine own self does assail
To lose from thy body / a foot or else an hand No^ne foret satius de cor^ore
perdere dextra^^ Qua^ parte^: cuius viribus ipse sapis? Qua^ pars perte^: e
su^mo: quae e^ tibi tradita coelo Qua sine cu^ reli^s annumere^e feris?

Were it not less damage / and loss more tolerable
Than to lose that part / which makes understand
And makes man dyffer / from beast unreasonable
This is our soul or mind: which is incomparable
Given us from heuyn / without whose gouernyng
From wild and brude beasts / we dyffer little thing
But well might be counted / with them unreasonable O tibi quam falsa e^ spes:
vi uo: and funere ^uncto: Si vitae: and mortis dux tuus aeger abest? Su^t ergo
iprimis morbi de mente fugandi:

O / what hope disceytfull / have thou both quick and dead
If thy mind be from the / sick / blind / and enable
Which both in life and death / is granted the to lead
Wherefore here what counseyll / of reason does the read
First clens all disases / out of thy mind and thought
Than art thou sure and safe / and fail thou can naught
than art thou sound and hole / than art thou hole perfyte Quo tibi sis totus:
deficiat que nihil. Hanc tu per salubres / et rectos dirige calls Sana tibi
officiu^ ^ste^ vt ipsa suum. Sed ne ^e longu^ tenea^ ca^issime lector.

If thy mind and reason / be pure and without vice
So that thou gyde thy mind / right unto thy profit
In ways good and wholesome / and ryghtwyse exercise
Than shall it to the do / just duty and office
But brefely to show the / O reder^ere and kind
Think this is the duty / of perfyte and hole mind
An hole mind and perfyte / desires that only Officiu^ sanae mentis id est
puta: Vt ta^tum speret: quod prosit tempore in omni. Quodque sit immensum vel
sine fine bonu^. Vt timeat: quicqd pos sit sine fine nocere.

And that only hops / which lasts perdurable
Which all time does profit / the mind to fortify
And good without measure / or joy intermynable
On the other party / it dredeth pain damnable
And all things noyeng / with endless dolor
Wherein none assysteth / with confort nor sorour
More brefely to declare / the mind desires blys In quo no^ assit qui ferat
vllus opem. Omnibus vt studijs ^o lers ea gaudia querat. Quae nullus morbus
fra^ gere. visque potest. Vt soleat solu^ damnu^ quod nulla voluptas.

And would fly that tourment / which is interminable
With all crafty study / and means / glad it is
To seek that sure glory / and joy incomparable
Which non infyrmyte / to vyolate is able
It only does sorrow / those losses and damage
Whom no joy succedeth / nor pleasant advantage
But by whom life endless / and souls health is lost Consequi^ / vel quo vi^
ta / salusque perit. Caetera nil pendas nis^ quantu^ penditur vsu^ Hospicij
vnde parat. Hospes abire cito.

This dredeth an hole mind / and fears inwardly
In other erthely pleasour / it fares like and host
A short time soiournyng / and flyttyng by and by
Thing erthly and caduke / dispysyng utterly
Than use the like a ghest / take riches in like case
As one not long wyllyng / to tarry in one plase
Consider this moreover / and steadfastly believe Quin ea tu po^dus credas
morbosque graua^tes Quae te vel perimunt / vel remorantur iter.

That temporal treasour / of frail mu^dayne richesse
Is naught but a burden / the soul and mind to grieve
And in sundry troubles / blind wretches to oppress
With thought / labor / sorrow / care and heaviness
Which burden does outher oppress / fale thy mind
Or else in thy journey / hinder the far behind
Away faryng parsone / ought gladly to avoid Debet onus: morbu^que si mul
vitare viator. Vt peregat coepta^: qua^ cupit ire via^. Est via: qua gradimur:
vita haec erit alta vita: Patria perpetuum vel dabit exiliu^.

Both ponderous burden / and all disease also
Whereby in his journey / he might soon be accloyde
This life is a passage / or way / wherein we go
Circundate in compass / with mysery and woe
But the life ensuyng / is country permanent
Of rest / joy / solace / or else endless tourment
Thus outher he grau^teth / sure rest or exyle Si patria ad caros pro auo^:
carosque parents, I^mus: vt constet omni bus vna quies

If it grant us rest / than endless joy is ours
Among blyssed lyuers (in this life counted vile)
Among our forefaders / and old progenytours
Were filled with gladness / and void of all dolours
We shall all together / have rest interminable
And one like fruicion / in bliss in estimable
But if the life coming / put us in banysshment Sin vero exiliu^ capiet nos
vltima labes. Accipiet fletus: perpetuusque rogus. In patria^ redeunt: qui
freti munere sanae: Menti^ ab aduersis se explicuere malis.

Than extreme distruccion / shall us wretches oppress
In endless perdicion / fire: mournyng and tourment
And all manner kinds: of dolor and distress
But such shall in ^urete: the land of life possess
Which ruled by the gift / of hole mind have been feign
To ryd them from sins / and vile pleasours mundayne
But on the other part: such enters in exyle Exiliu^ contra subeu^t: qui
erroribus acti: Vtere se ad verum non potuere bonum. Men's errat: quoties ratio
no^ imperat: et cum Quae bona sunt: cernit deteriora sequens.

Which driven in errors: to their confusyon
Could find in their hertes / to turn no time nor while
To virtue and goodness / from blind abusion
The mind blyndly erreth / as often as reason
Not rules / but seeing / clearly what thing is best
The worst it ensues / by frowardness oppressed
But over long digression / we make as I suppose Sed nimiu^ fuimus digressi:
iamque redire: Causa monet nostrum: propositumque sequi In coeptu^ fuerat nr^m
moderatio motus. Quodque nitet tebus: co^ spicitur que decus.

The matter requires us / forward to auau^ce
And brefely to return / again to our purpose
To speak of the virtue / of worthy Temperau^ce
Of well ordered manners / and goodly governance
And what order shyneth / and worthy comlynesse
When men list their deeds / discretly to redress
In this thing our speech / hole writing / and our style Hac in re noster sermo
versabitur omnis. Tam liquido: qua^tum nostra thalia potest. In primis igi^
studeas seruare decorum. Vis magna officijs eius inesse solet.

Or co^municacion / shall hensforth proceed
As plain as our ingyne / us grants to compyle
Wherefore / first and namely / endeuoyre and take heed
To keep comely order / in every word and deed
In all deed and duyte / most of effect doutlesse
Is to rule thine acts / in ordered comeliness
This comeliness rests / in dew conuenience Dicitur id duplex cum quodda^
sit moderantis Quodda^ common quod generale magis. Quod common seru^t^e^ quod

And semely proporcion / orderyng thy deeds all
Of whom to reduce the / to clear intelligence
One comeliness is called / proporcyon special
Another comeliness / common and general
The first one belongs / to man's own body
The other to behauour / with outward company
Of outward comeliness in behauour.
This outward comeliness / common and general Hoc magis appa^e^^s oculis
simul auribus extat. Hoc sine nil ^ectu^: nil reor esse bonum.

Is so sure annexed / to life of honest
That without it / honest / can be nothing at all
So is it aparent / and opyn to the eye
Opyn to beholders / both for to hear and se
Without this behauour (after my judgment)
No life can seem honest / right nor convenient
This comeliness called / naught ^ls ought to be No^ aliud fuerit: quam
conuenientia rerum: Quas hoies recte: ve^ sapienter agunt.

But of men's deeds / adewe conuenience
That is / when their words / and warkes well agree
Well syttyng and semyng: by wisdom and prudence
Naught done without measure* nor without prouydence
This wise upon prudence / is granted Temperaunce
As next unto reason / gyde of good governance
And as form and beauty / is in the hole body Et velut ^ toto co^^usa est
corpore forma. Nec tame^ est corp*sed magis id: quod inest: Sic etia^ recto
censetur inesse decorum: Quod rectum exo^nat quodque videre ^uuat.

yet is it not the body / but joined thereunto
Right so is comeliness / comoyned semblably
To man's behauour / the same adornyng so
With order / look: iesture / and cyrcunstances mo
That men takes pleasour / joy and felycyte
Thing right and well ordered / so semely for to se
And like as the fayrnesse / and corporal beauty Sic mouet hoc animo^ oculos
vt forma venusta: Corpotis oblectat: detinet: atque mouet.

Delyteth and moves / with pleasour to behold
So comeliness of life / with great felycyte
Rejoices to man's mind / much more a hundred fold
For good men count virtue / more pre^yous than gold
And well ordered manners / surmou^tyng all richesse
And namely adourned / with pleasant comeliness
This common comeliness / or order general
More plainly appears / and shows more persyte
By the light of reason / and in his mind one shall
More plainly perceive it / than any pen may write
Or that man with words / is able to resyte
Wherefore this omyttyng let us our style address
Compendiously to touch / the second comeliness.
Of the second comeliness in behauour.
The second comeliness: concerning honest Sed neque desidiae ded^^int se

Belongs to mankind: in proper governance
To temper his mocyons: that all they well agree
In habyte: voice / iesture / in look and countenance
In shamefastness / measure / time / place / and cyrcu^staunce
So that all thy manners / in word / look and iesture
Is the time requires / be ordered by measure
Such manners shall the make / pleasant and acceptable Aut leget aut scribit cum

Whether a multitude / do the commend or blame
The judgment of many / is grievous to dispyse
And often common rumor / is troth: I the promise

Unto the common voice / of people to obey Nec cures sensus si no^ percepit ad

Some manners uncomely / by their dyfformyte Na^ spersum in ^ra ^^emen producere

By their ill example / or unkind injury
Offends men's minds / and wou^deth as we se
How vyolent weapyn / often wounds the body
But such of vile manners / are called commonly
Uyle persons vnmanered / and wretches without shame
Them hurtyng the body / unright wise may we name
Nor think it not enough / nor thing suffycient Cui tacito vires subge ^i^

All only for to keep / order: and comeliness
Of iesture / of body / as is convenient
Also thou must study / with gretter business
The comeliness of mind / inward to redress
And inwardly to keep / that beauty most of all
Much rather than hauour / or iesture corporal
This comeliness is kept / and good order of mind Ast animu^ poterit com

When clear reason rules / as regent sovereign
Or if it be subject / against nature and kind
Than soon to his power / it to restore again
And still in holy trone / it after to mentayne
For where reason rules / or is sure rep^rate
By no lust uncomely / can mind be vyolate.
Of ire to be eschued.

This foul vice dysfourmeth / both countenance and mind
The tongue it distayneth / brynnyng the heart on fire
What can thou consider / more lothely in mankind
Than a wrathful vysage / raygne as tyran blind?
Often grynnyng / often gnastyng / and fomyng in furour
Or gapyng as a bear / poor wretches to devour
As a bore assailed / with dogs round about Sic dispumat aper: cin ctus

Or as a proud pal^ray / chafed with spur or byt
From their mouths casts / white fomyng strem^ out
So fares this blind wretch / ragyng for want of wit
As ready in his furour / all meschefe to commyt
No man would suppose him / a man of wit laudable
But turned to fures / like be unreasonable
And as one furyous / mad / ragynge without mind Consilium perdit tanquam
furia sus. et amens Poenitet hu^c facti protinus inde sui.

He loses all counsel / and ryghtwyse tugement
His reason subdued / his wits all made blind
And often he commits / hasty and vyolent
That deed / which long after / him causes to repent
He suddenly stryketh / with word or else knyfe
And wenyng to correct / depryueth name or life
Than straight he repents / and pensyfe is therefore
And without remedy / his wrath turns to woe
For neither name nor life / can he again restore
Thus losyng another / himself is lost also
And by his occasyn / often diverse other mo

Long sorrow and bewail / one hasty wretches syn.
How man may retrayne and beware of ire.

Or ire take his enter (consider well this clause)
That if inflame the / thy reason is accloyed
Therefore at beginning / resyst a space and pause
Well ponderyng and musyng / what is the ground and cause
And whether by rasshe anger / thou remedy may find
If not / than refrain the / and mytygate thy mind
Like as wise warryout / sygneth a sowdyour In specula tanquam vigilat ^

Beholding forth a far / from wyndowes of a tower
So watch thou for wrath / and anger semblably
Consider his assautes / and wisely put them by
Resyst at beginning / ponder that pacyence

Draw nere the thine armor / as wise and prouydent
At the first mocyon / when ire shall the assail
Stand stoutly resyst him / strongly incontinent
Like as thou would withstand / thy foes vyolent
Or as if thou feared / thieves approchyng nere

Than suffer not thy self / therein long to remain
But rise thou as quyckely / as from a flaming fire
To fall / less rebuke is / so man soon rise again
But in the mean season / while ire does the distayne
Take not rasshe punysshment: of any crat^re
For ire has no manner / no mercy nor measure
At all time abhor thou / to much cruelte Sae^iciam nimia^ tu detes^abere

affligis alumnos Cu^ modica i natos poe na sit apta patris.

For great offenses / take little punysshment
Revenge thy wrongs / with mercy and pity
But namely thou father / be meke and pacyent
Anenst thy dear children: and not to vyolent
For small punysshment: does sore and great appear
Of a tender father / against his children dear
While men think by rygour / folly to myttygate Ac venia^ pronum cum te natura

Often time the transgressour / correct beyond measure
Is proner unto syn / more hard and obstynate
Since prone unto mercy / the fourmed has nature
Follow not in manners / a beastly creature
Blast not after blood / by cruel vengeance
Thus art thou commanded / by worthy Temperance.
Of to much bourdyng or sport to be eschewed.
Another wild mocyon / to ragyng ire contrary Est quoque vitandus mo tus
contrarius trae: Qui semper ludo vertitur / inque ioco. Non nos ad ludos genuit
natura: iocusque. Sed multo graui^ illa requirit opus.

As dyssolute sportes / and wanton game or play
Also must be voyded / as thing not necessary
Mankind is not borne / to sport and bourde always
Though lust this requires / yet reason will say nay
Of nature to tryfels / product none of us be
But to sadder pastyme / and work of grauyte
Be rather in words fruitful / and profitable Vtilis in dictis sis plu^ quam
voce sacetus. Seria sint crebro: ratior ipse iocus. Non tn^ illa vetat nos
ludere. nonque iocari. Sed iubet in rebus omnibus esse modum.

Than iocondly jesting / with word of wanto^nesse
Men iugeth the lycour / to the vessel semblable
And often time the words / does man's thought express
Use syldom time bourdes / but often use sadness
yet temperance charge not / sportes to refuse
But in time and measure / all things for to use
Neither it seems / to use the in that wise No^ decet: vt tanque durus
fugiaris: et asper. Nec quoque co^temptus sis leuitate tua. Gloria no^ ludo
tibi sit quaesita: iocoque: Vt tota fias ludius vrbe vagus.

That all men forsake the / for solemn grauyte
Nor to be so wanton / that all men the dispyse
For companable sportes / and famyliaryt^
Seek not to get glory / nor lauds unto the
Of a common iester / or bourder having name
Thou countest this worship / but certesse it is shame
Like as it is lefull / to people fatygate Vt licuit fessis vites re perate
quiet: Sic salibus raris te recreate licet: Cumque iocu^ misces sic: sic
moderabere dictis: Ne facile ex ipsa tu grauitate cadas.

And weary with labor / their bodies to comfort
And some time them restyng / their strenght to recreate
Right so is it lefull / to bourdes to resort
And sometime the spyrytes: to recreate with sport
But mengle so in measure / mirth and ^o^undyte
That men not repute the / forgottyn grauyte
Use mirth with good manners / and moderate measure Sit iocus i^genuus:
moderatus: sit verecu^dus. In quo vel multum luceat ingenium. Ergo vbi te^pus
erit no^ tanquam scurra volabis. Sit salibus po^dus gestu^ et ipse grauis.

With honest shame fastness / and not outragyous
Or else in such words / of mirth thy self inure
Whereby thou may appear / quick and ingenyous
Not ragyng in iestes / as rybalde vylla^ous
But when thou see season / and fellows like to the
Than season thy bourdes / with prudent grauyte
And under iocunde iestes / close wysdom and substance
Not gyglyng nor laughyng / for others vain pleasour Vox tua no^ nimio fuerit
clamore soluta. Neccitus icessus: cuique tumultus inest.

As the time requires / after thy countenance
And after thy matter / not to wanton nor sour
Exalt not thy words / in dissolute clamor
Nor in speech superflue / in going and iesture
Be not rasshe nor hasty / but sober and demure
Hurt no manner person / with thy iestyng words No^ laedant quenquam eaueas
tua verba iocosa. Contristent nullu^: sint sine dente sales.

Gyueng them occasyon of anger or sadness
Avoid of all checkes / se that thou use thy bourdes
To move one to malice / another to gladness
It ought not be lauded / but reproved doubleness
Though many by thy mirth / be iocunde in an hall
One checked and hasty / soon trouble may them all
And brefely such bourdes: are little of valor
Which purchase dyspleasour of any creature
In causyng one to laugh / another for to loure
Nor no man forbyddeth / our writing or scripture
To laugh / so it be done / in manner and measure Nec ridere veta^t que^quam mea
scripta modeste. Sed nimiu^ risum forma decora vetat.

But comeliness of chere / and shape of countenance
By laughyng superflue / is grieved of semblance
Of over much laughyng to be forborne
Over much laughyng / is foul and dishonest Turpis enim risus nimius nam
fusus vbique Quid pueri: and fractus quod mulieris habet.

Unto the face and figure / not small dyfformyte
One always loud laughyng / at every toy and jest
Makes his hyd folly / plain euydent to be
One every where laughyng / as is a child to se
Loud gyglyng and laughyng / is but a folysshe sign
And euydent token / of manners femenyne
Gryn not in derysion / with feigned countenance Est odio dignus: q furt^m
riserit: et qui De da^no alterius soluerit ora iocans.

A fair iocunde smylyng / is counted commendable
Who laugheth at myschefe / therein having plesance
Of hatred / is worthy / as leude and reprouable
To laugh at vice committed: is grievous and damnable
As theft or auoutry / or others loss or grefe
Such seem by their laughyng / menteners of myschefe.
Of over much and dishonest play to be eschued.
Fly gamnynge and plays / as rote of sundry crime In ^udis vites: quo quae
stus quaeritur. et quo Iactura^ nimiam te^poris ipse facis.

And most namely such / where lucre is damnable
Or where loss ensues / of goods name and time
And falshod committed / by means dysceyuable
Where is murder / perjury / and oaths abhomynable
And other his conclusyon / theft / strife / and beggary
Or goods falsely gotten / by fraud and treachery
Of fresshe lusty iuuent / if thou be in the flour Si fueris iuuents: ludu^
tibi quaerere laboris: Qui ca^m praestet: quem moderate tamen.

Than get the to sportes / as is to the semyng
Thy strenght to exercise / in pastyme of labor
But use must thou measure / and order in all thing
With time and company / as seems best syttyng
Observe these circumstances / and gamnyng is laudable
Or else it is folly / and thing bytuperable
Age never saw I play / and without loss of time Ludere non vnquam vidi / nec
perdere tempus: Egregium: et digna cu^ grauitate senem.

For gamnyng and age / does very ill agree
A small fault to youth / in age is grievous crime
None old man can play / and keep his grauyte
Of death the remembrance / his gamnyng ought to be
It is a fond fury / and very blind dotage
To have chyldysshe pleasour / in cold decrepyte age
Age wise and great player / never saw I in my live Nec iuuene^ vidi nimio se
dede^e ludo: De quo praecipui spes sit habenda boni.

Nor a young man given / to greatly unto play
Which in time to come / was lykely for to thryue
Or come to great honor / but rather soon decay
Wherefore youth refrain the / con^yder this always
Well may thou recover / riches and honest
But time past and misspent / revoked can not be
Of wise men and learned / frequent the company Sit tibi co^gressus cum doctis:
cumque peritis: Cu^: studio lassus te recreare cupis. Ingenij vires auget
meditatio gressus. Incolumes artus non minus ille facit.

When thou art dysposed / thy mind to recreat
After weary watchyng / and labor of study
Of such company / if thou be clean pryuate
Muse than on some pleasour / not hurtyng thine estate
Mebytacyon augmenteth / the wits semblably
And quickens / as walkyng does comfort the body
Of lust of Uenus to be refrayned.
Be not beastly ready / thy iustes to fulfill
Let Uenus fell brydell / her pleasours to refrain Sentiat and frenu^ Veneris
sibi adesse voluptas Ne qua^tum libuit: sit spaciata procul. Qui nimis indulget
ve ne^i paretque palato: Re pecus est: tantu^ nomine dictus homo.

For if thy carnal desire / a broad wander at will
Thy foul name and body / it greatly shall distayne
Who to much on Uenus / fixes his mind and brain
Or leans to his belly / is beastly of nature
Of man only bearyng / the name / shape / and figure
Naught lykeneth more mankind / to pass unreasonable
Than glotony and sloth / and lust without reason
These three confederate / in workyng agreeable
To virtuous manners / are venomous poison
Both wit and dyscresyon / keeping in dongion
And who that perseuereth in any of these same
He loses / soul / body / life / riches / and good name
What remedies are against body lust.
Who would of vile Uenus / alay the fervent flame Quisque cupidine as poterit
co^pescere fla^mas. Qui some^ta rogis abstulit apta suis. Quique nihil volue^s
any mo quod concitet igne^ Nec nisi seruata sobrietate bibit.

Or quench in his body / the nutryment of ^nstes
Must take away / the fyry brondes from the same
Remembryng it shall turn / to caryon and dust
Naught kyndlyng for this flame / in mind reuolue he must
And soberness observed / he must avoid excess
Naught kyndleth more Cupide / tha^ beastly dre^kenesse
Wha^ fair flateryng Cupyde / shall the with dart assail In pugnam dubij nol^
prodire duelli. Cu^ venere: and me^sa pr^ lia in fre cave.

Abide not the byckeryng / stand not to strive and fight
It is a stryle doutfull and dangerous battle
And most for a vantage / it is to take thy flight
Avoid place and presence / fly words fly the sight
Fly bed / board / and chamber / trust not to thy wisdom
Else art thou made subject / and wrechedly overcome
Nor be thou not in purpose: to prove or to assay Nec te^ta^e velis / qua^
sobrius atque pudicus Cum Thais: and me^sa sit tibi structa prope. Difficile
est fla^mam no^ se inclinare repent. Proxima cu^ rapido sit sita stupa rogo.

How thou can inchastyte / and soberness abide
When the table charged / and Thays decked gay
To tempe and provoke the: be ready by thy side
But fly and withdraw the / beware and stand a wide
Conioyne not fire to flax / the one hot / the other dry
It hard is to keep both / flaming suddenly
That thou may overcome: the vices beastyall Turpia quo vicas: fac certes
eminus illis. Fac tua ne subeat tecta petulca cohors.

Fight with them aloufe / and never approach nigh
Of the sort of Thays / suffer thou none at all
In the house to enter / far fly their company
The gorgious dispysyng / regard not utterly
Their peakes nor pappes / their glystryng painted skyn
Advise not / for these are / hyd snares unto syn
Their false hear inuolued / in nets intrycate
Their breasts vnbrased / their smerkyng painted chyn
Of iouth and co^fusyon / and the fyndes bayte Ne veniant intro: cum vestibus
obstrue portas No^ tutum est illis con seruisse manus.

From god to Lucifer / yo^ge people for to win
Therefore bar thy gates / let none of them come in
A void them as fures / issued out of hell
It is extreme peril / with any of them to mell
For if they ones enter / and ones thy heart inflame Non sine te victo: credas
in fine: recedent. Ipse triumphatus: et spoliatus eris.

Believe / they depart not (so come they for the nones)
Till they have overcome the / to thy rebuke and shame
And till thou be spoiled / and gnawen to the bones
Therefore fly their claws / fly and a void at ones
For it is but folly / to trust thy wit and might
For here in is gotten / sure vyctory by flight
And that is more wonder / and much more maruayle Quaeri^ hac in resolu^
fugie^do triumphus / Quid mirere magis* est data palma fugae

The palm here is given / to such as will not fight
But flies in all haste / and will not abide battle
Resemblyng a cowarde / and auoydyng out of sight
Trust not thy wysdom: thy grauyte nor might
These femenyne flateryng / and weeping faynedly
Subdueth all co^stance / and might they molle^y.
Of means to redeem ye from bondage of Uenus.
If thou to vile Uenus / or blynd^ Cupyde volage Denique captiuus si forte
cupidinis ires. Te propere redimas: quam minimo aere potes.

Be led as subget / bound in captyuyte
For as small as thou can / thy self ryd of bondage
Have the by some train / out of prison to be
Sone fyle of thy fetters / get the ^oly^erte
If small things help not / no pecy^^^e thou spare
Use vyolence or strenght / to break thy deedly snare
Shake of thy color / from thy necks miserable Excute de miseris laqueos
ceruicibus ipsos Vim facias: sugias: est mora plena mali. Na quicunque fuit
Vene ri blanditus ab illa. Durius affectus ignib* esse solet.

In tarry is no trust / but ioperdy mortal
As old roted sores / appears incurable
So is it hard to fly / old lust veneryall
Who flattereth blind Uenus / has most bondage of all
And while man prolongeth / to leave his wild desire
Him Uenus most flameth / with feruenty deedly fire
Sith thou art man fourmed / to gods own image Cumque homo sis certe divine
mentis imago: Vt deus arcane est: sic procul esse stude. Quamuis clam pecces
semp tn^ es tibi testis. Cur alium quam te: tu vereare magis.

Preserve gods figure / from beestly vylany
Follow not thy lusts / as rennyng in outrage
But from carnal pleasoure / a void the utterly
Remember thou not can / offend so secretly
But that thine own person / is witness present there
Tha^ why should yt other more / than thine own self fere
Thou would not offend / before a king present
Nor any other person / which loves honest
Than art thou not aferde / of god omnypotent
So foul deed to committee / before his mageste?
Do thou not consider / that god all thing does se?
Alas / whether wylt thou fly / to perform thy lust
But god there is present / and se the needs must
Fly up to the clouds / or hyde the in the ground
Enclose the in tauernes / or place inuestygable
In heuyn / hell / and earth / or in the sea profounde
Our lord all beholds / O catyfe miserable
Consider this in mind / and live as reasonable
If thou would abasshe / before a lord or knight
Than fear thou more greatly / to syn in gods sight
Wherefore / sith our lord / does every thing espy Qui latitant intus mo tus
compone deco^os. Nec minus id cure^: ij quia sort latent. Namque parum refert
quam memo perspicit illos. Quos tacito tecu^ nocte: dieque vides.

And sercheth the secrets / of thine heart and mind
Order and dyspose well / thy manners inwardly
And thine inward mocyons / in comely order bind
And though they be secret / yet leave them not behind
For though none perceive them / ye thing forces but small
Sith thine owyn conscience / and god beholds all
Though vile lust of Uenus / in all men be damnable Omnibus est vitio Veneris
damnosa libido. Sed nihil in senibus foedius esse potest. Praeterea senibus
nimirum conuenit illud. Exemplo vt iuuenes: consilijsque regant

yet is it most loathsome / and vile in crooked age
In age can no thing / be more foul and reprouable
Nor thing more resemblyng / to frensy or rage
For this thing belongs / to fathers old and sage
By their good example to govern wild iuuent
And not to enduce them / to work insolent
And so behold men aged / in co^munycacion Se praestent tales cora^ sermonibus
illis: Vt possint multo: semper honor coli. Hoc solo quo^da^ fuerat veneranda
senectus. Hoc solo antiquo^ ij voluere patres.

Before youth begaue them / fyled with none offense
That their good example / of conuersacyon
May reduce frail iuuent / to virtue and prudence
Whereby they may till age / have greatter reverence
For such good example / and hauour commendable
In old time men aged: were greatly honorable
And for such example / sad fathers ancient Sed co^tra iuuenes semu^
venere^tur: adore^t. Sint comites lo^gae: sub sidiumque viae.

Were honored of fathers / more young of their lynage
Again this belongs / to duty of iuuent
To worship and honor / old fathers sad and fage
To sustain and confort / their life and feeble age
To gyde and assyst them / in church / way and street
Gyueng them stead and service: where ever they them mete
And whether court or maket / require / or solemn day Curia seu poscat: seu
sacri festa dei: Haerebit senibus officio sa cohors. Ex quibus optabu^t cui*
precepta sequantur Gesta simul cuius sint ^^itanda magis.

This longs to duty / of young men commendable
To f^lowe sage fathers: and cleue to them always
With trusty attendance / and waytyng seruyable
Of whom youth shall desire / sad doctrine profitable
To know whose example / them seems to ensue
Whose iesture to follow / and whose they should exchue
For truth a great token / is in him of virtue Est (fateor) magnu^ signum
virtutis in illo Obsequio gaudet q celebrare senem.

Which glad is with service / to honor feeble age
For his good example / shall many mo ensue
And honor shall he have / after of his lynage
But one young dispysyng / old faders sad and sage
Is lykely in his age / to be of small valor
And not worthy service / love / worship / nor honor.
Of temperance to young men belongyng
young men should dyspose them / always to business Confirmet iuuenu^ labor and
patie^tia corpus. A^cendi a venere sunt nimioque m^ro.

And laudable labor refusyng for no pain
And therein them custom / auoydyng ydelnesse
From excess of wynes / they must them self abstain
And vile lust of Uenus / by soberness refrain
For ydell youth disposed / to beastly glotony
Ren heedlyng to riot / vile lust and lechery
Therefore ought their meats / be common and homely Sineque cibi viles positi
vulgataque mensa Nam tantu^ venture: no^ saturanda gula est. No^ epulas iuueni
mit tat famosa popina. Sed: quas decoxit parca coquina patri^

Not over abundant / costly nor deynteous
To content their body / and not for glotony
Serve thou not iuuent / with dysshes sumptuous
From the costly kychen / of taste delycyous
Small thing pleases nature / let them content yt womb
With scarce meat in measure / of poor kychen at home
Conforted is nature / by meats in measure Aptius id cernas interno lumine
mentis: Quam verbo aut cala mis id reserare queam

Man's life is lengthed / by dyete temperate
By meats immoderate / confounded is nature
Complexion corrupt / and life is breuyace
The clear wit obscured / and reason vyolate
And with sluggysshe sloth / the body hole oppressed
For when belly full is / the bones would have rest
Thus temperate diet / labor / and exercise Sed decus e^ aliud / quod partem
spectat honesti Que proprios motus te^perat / atque regit. Hoc habitu: gestu:
me^sura: voce / pudore. Est positu^: in cultu: te^pore tumque loco.

Belongs unto youth*to bate their hye courage
And wtdrawe their minds / from leude pleasour of vice
In likewise is labor / belongyng unto age
It seems not old men / them self reputyng sage
To give them unto sloth / what wise man can deny
But that to many things / men aged may apply
After they at morning / at sons first rysyng
Have served devoutly / our maker first of all Hoc facit: vt placeas: gratus
sis omnibus vnus* In populu^ de te fama perennis eat.

Than may they write or read / or do some other thing
Of light easy labor / as be does them befall
But children ought to learn / and rulers on them call
To close in their minds / lernyng as chief treasour
For youth soon is moved / to burthyn of labor
Soon is youth compelled / the yoke strongly to bear Nec spernas populus de te
quid sentiat ois. Est grave cu^ctorum spernere iudiciu^. Iudicio inserui populi
na^que esse superbus Creditur is: solus q sua facta probat.

Therefore let them learn / and render busely
And as for this matter / have thou no care nor fere
All if they conceive not / each sentence parfytly
Though they diverse books / can render by and by
For sede is not sowyn / into the ground in vain
Though it spryng not up / incontinent again
For it certain season / is hyd within the ground^ Offendu^t ai^os hominu^
deformia quaeda^: Vt viola^t corpus spicu la missa manu. Qui tn^ offendunt: ho^

Dyfferryng for to spryng / yet ryseth it at last
But in the mean season / it rests and is bound
Norysshed in the ground / and rotyng it self fast
As in the mothers womb / but when that time is past
And it has received / hyd / nutryme^t / and strenght
To hundred fold fruit / it spryngeth at the length
So under like maner*a child tender and mylde Corperis haud tantu^ ser uandu^

What thing he has learned / in his frail tender age
Shall find thereof the fruit / when he passed child
And come to man's estate / with double auau^tage
Therefore first record thou / as bird within a cage
In thy joyous iuuent / thy tunes tempryng long
And than at man's estate / forth with thy pleasant song
Becomely in clothyng / as seems thy degree ^^^ tibi conuenie^s cul^us
grauitateque dignus Ne retegat vestis quod tibi cord latet. Vestis eni multos

Mete unto grauyte / to wysdom and sadness
Fly pomp apparayle / list outward vanyte
Might show thy hyd thoughts / and inward folysshnesse
For often proud apparayle / does opynly express
Light manners mysordred / hyd in the mind within
As inward complexyon / appears in the skyn
A reed byle or blyster / apperyng outwardly Que rupit in summo carnis: vesica
pusilla Est index infra sangui ni^ ill^ mali.

Is token that ill blood: corrupt and putryfyed
Is closed in the flesh: or veins inwardly
Right so / by the clothyng / ill manners are espied
Such euydent signs / are hard to be denied
Thus dyssolute clothyng: wanton / and varyable
Declares wild manners / and rasshe minds unstable
Such wanton apparayle: and dysgysyng delicate Delicias potius credas
mulieribus aptas: Qua^uis nec nimias in muliere probem.

Belongs to women / light / volage / and unstable
And much it repugneth / to man's sad estate
yet is it in woman / not greatly commendable
Save only that foles / rejoice in their babble
And frail creatours / of reason vnparfyte
In outward dysgysyng / have special delight
Wherefore / if such pleasours of pompose vanyte Quate deliciae si sint. non
mollis inbaete. Nec si no^ fuerit: anxi^ ipse pete. ^oemineos sultus: and
gestus sumere molles. Vir pu^et indignu^ ridiculumque simul.

Come to the by fortune / do not to them apply
If fortune deny them / as contrary to the
Than likewise dispyse them / nor seek them not greatly
A man ought to count it / indigne / and unseemly
To cloth him repugnant / to custom of nature
In woman's apparayle / or femenine vesture
Such manner is worthy / scorn and dyrysion Quid magis est contra ^^tura^ /
sine decorum / Qua^ sub foeminea vi^^^e vest virum? Sorde tame^ cateas nec
(...) videaris ag^estis: Mollicie^ pariter: duri^^emque fuge.

What is more uncomely: repugnant to nature
Than man to lead his life / in frail condition
Under fond dysgysyng / of femynyne vesture
But yet in thy clothyng / be not vile and impure
Lest some man repute the / a rude rural vylayne
From excess and contempt / in like manner abstain
Go neither in clothyng / to wanton nor to vile Sis paup quamuis / tu munde

In all thyngys measure / is counted commendable
Though nedy pouerte / all wealth from the exyle
yet go clean and clenly / as much as thou art able
For though thou be poor / yet honest laudable
Will that thy poor clothyng / be not fylthy / but clean
By poor clean apparayle / god life is outward seen

yet do I not counseyll / nor moves to rudeness
But measure I commend / which keeps honest
Between tender clothyng / and rygour or hardness
Penury not praise I / nor yet commend excess
Extremyte in all thing / is very ill syttyng
But mean and measure / is lauded in all thing.
Of temperau^ce / in lyueng and diet to be observed.

(non art paratae) Quae possit tantum tol le^e pa^ca famem. Sufficie^s victus

Nor seek not for meats / costly nor exquysyte
Prepare not by connyng / sweet meats varyable
To slake thyrst and hunger: have only thy delight
Let fode be sufficient / to slake thine appetyte
Garnysshe not thy board: for lust and glotony
But only for nature / and need of thy body
Let hunger be thy sauce / thy meats to season Excitet ipsa fames ieiunum
longa palatum. No^ sapo^ iuue^tus mul ceat art gulam.

Provoke thine appetyte / by wholesome abstynence
Care not if thy dysshes: or meats be gheason
Where one dysshe suffiseth / can be none indyg^nce
Enough is a banquet / and plesaunt opulence
By savor of sauces: the stomach to excyte
Is sign of glotony / and bestyall delight
Reken not thy dysshes / but wholesome meat desire Fercula no^ numetes of cas sed
posce salubres. Et placeat: quae olim coena placebat au^s.

Content the with diet / of fathers ancient
Which whylom were called / from plough till an empire
To rule all the world / for lyueng excellent
Cold fruytes for their fode / thought they sufficient
Than what pleasour have thou / so costely to procure
So deynteous disshes / of them to make ordure
Think it not great glory / to get thy self a name Nec magni esse puta: quod
gloria pta culina Sit tibi: sed potius sobrietate stude.

By smokyng of kechyns / like as the smoke does waste
So lightly with the smoke / does vanysshe such fame
And thy laud forgotten / when hungre is ones paste
While the rich is replete / uneaths at the last
Is one simple morsel / set to the wretched pore
Which in cold and hungre / forth stands at the door
Say what is thy glory / for meats this wise spent
It is for vain glory / thy meryt is right small
If thou wylt make feasts / for god omnypotent
Than feed gods servants / pore people first of all
Herin is sure merit / and lauds special
And right path dyrectyng / to laud and ^oye endless
Wherefore thus behave the / or use thou soberness
Of all ^hynges beware / o^ ^ea^ya^ (...)
For it man defyleth / with most deformyte
And does not for the time / much differ from madness
When it is inflamed / to rasshe audacyte
By madness it kyndleth / all vile enormyte
It discloseth counseyll / and casts to the ground
Most famous old Cities / the fame does it confound
It febleth the body / abrydgyng mann es life
It moves debates / and kyndleth lechery
Thousands it murdreth / without wepen or knyfe
It breaks louedayes* and causes robbery
The wit it confounds / with hasty frenesy
When these vile dronkard^ / are ingorged as swyne
What seek they but braulyng / lust murder and tapyne
No counseyll nor conforte / no grauyte / no grace
None order / no manners / no law / nor honest
No wealth / strenght / nor riches / can rest where it has place
But all it confounds / by bestialyte
Reioysyng in mischefe / and all iniquyte
Alas wretched dronkard^ / aduert thy beastly syn
Consider in what state / and blyndnesse thou art in
While thou wastest drynkes / the drynkes wastes the*
While thou wine consumest / by lust insaciable
Thy self art consumed / in thine enormyte
Before our lord art thou / counted abhomynable
Of angels dispysed / as beast unreasonable
Of men art thou scorned / and hated of most part
And of all virtues: plain destytute thou art
The fendes infarnall / also does the confound
Thy reason is blinded: and drowned in ordure
And as a wytlesse beast / all tredde the to the ground
Alas / grace thou losest / and confoundest nature
Finally / abhorred / of eurry creature
In blasphemyng oaths / is thy delectacion
And head^yg thou rennest / unto damnacion
Wherefore this consider / and ponder in thy mind Nec tamen parc^^rie subeas
quam nome^ auari.

What mo diverse peryls / proceeds of dronknesse
In bounds of measure / therefore thy lyueng bind
And purchase the virtue / of wholesome sobrenesse
But though I give counseyll / to fly and ^oyde excess
yet give I not counseyll / to be so scarce and hard
That men may repute the / a covetous nygarde
And use in all places / of thy manners to babble Et fias vulgi fabula trita tui.
In minimis rebus ne cures figere leges: Laeticiae vt nullus sit datus vsque
locus.

So that thy lyueng / to strayt in nygardnesse
Among common people / be as a common fable
Also in small things / use not so great hardness
That no place be granted / to pleasour and gladness
Fire thou no laws / between other and the
But that sometime gladness / may confort grauyte
For often of small things / comes great dishonor

Our manners to vary / and deeds to redress
To time / place / and causes / according as they fall
One self thing is not done / honest / in times all
Our deeds must alter / and vary / be thou sure
As monstrous protheous / often varyed figure

Such things as thou did / being of simple name Ia^que magistratus modo quod

Without room or office / lauded in diverse wise
When thou art in office / thou must vary the same
And of thine old manners / the greatest part dispyse
In court or in City / thou must not use that gyse
In roughe speech and cruel / which thou had in battle
There / tygour auaunced / here meekness does prevail
If thou waxing aged / use youths business Si stuijs ageris iuueni libus ipse

Know thou for certain thou passest thy nature
Thy duty and bounds / excedest thou doutlesse

Was to live till age / but when thy self art old
A new manner a life / thou needs must require
Where thou in youth lived / rasshe / negligent: and bold
A gain age requires / wise manners / sad and cold
And old men and chyldysshe / of manners ought certain

So much let thy manners / from lay men disagre
How much more thou passyst / in great auctorite
In myter or order / in office or prebende
So much look in virtue / and manners to ascend
And as thou procedest / as regent honorable
In virtue and manners / like wise be president No^ facias vt qui sque facit:

And though none about the / to the be comparable
yet be thou not more proud / more haute or negligent
Nor trust not more greatly / to thine own judgment
But do in due order: what longs unto the
Not following the life: nor sect of co^monte

Of manners like a mouse / no longer may thou be

And watch well thy foldes / as ought a good pastor
A pastor well watches / by night / dredyng rapyne
Lest vyolent wolves / might his weak sheep devour
It can not be enough / for merit and honor
Thine own pryuate parsone / in saue^arde for to keep

Their duty they challenge / and never are content
Though they in their duty / be never neglygent

As the cause requires / after thy time and state
Dyfferre long / assay all / or thou be varyable
Be constant discretly / not hard nor obstynate
It is a sign of mind / light / and infatuate
The manner of thy lyueng / to change suddenly
And great fault and folly / if it be done rasshely
By little and by little / therefore thy lyueng change
For sudden mutacions / repugneth to nature
And among acquayntaunce / as well as among strange
Such changyng / not wants / suspecion be thou sure

An old tree tranposed / shall find small advantage

And unkindly served / such bird loses her song
But young fetherles fowls / straight takyn from te nest
Naught knowing of pleasour / may more suffer of wrong
An hawk fed unkindly / can not contynewe long
What should a child do playeng / with syngyng bird or foul

A vyllayns subicte / a iolous boys wife Tu^ quoque paulatim mu tes: nam facta

And a chyldis bird / are woe and hard bested

Else may thou mourn to death / as wretch unfortunate.
Of the duty and hauyour of men in great room and office.
If thou be auaunced / to room of dignyte
Than void and exclude thou / thine old and pryuate mind Ipse magistratus

Seek not as before / thine own vtylyte
Remember how thy charge / and office does the bind
To seek the common well / leauyng thine own behind
Consider / thou art set in place of great labor
To serve a multitude: as head and governor
And rather have thou name / of labor / than honor Per te nu^c populus
loquitur: sentitque videtque Vtile quod fuerit oibergo vide Publica priuatis

In this wise promoted / to troublous dignyte

Therefore / note that people / feel / se / and speak by the
Than holy dispose the / for their vtylyte
Prefer common profit / before profit pryuate
For pryuate behauour / besemeth not astate

Before his own profit / should set Justyce and right

Observe comeliness / manners / or majesty
In word / look / and habyte / as seems thy degree

Much thing is forbidden / not comely nor semyng
Which are not prohybyte: but sound to honest
To a pryuate parsone / or man mean lyueng
Also the time and place / refuses many a thing
For in one time and place / a thing may be laudable
Which after and elswer done / were inco^mendable
Therefore the sage father / renomed Sophocles Iurgauit merito Sophoclen collega

Steadfastly beheld: and praised the beauty
Of a goodly stryplyng / of stature excellent
Which was that time present / in time of Jugement
If this same Sophocles / had after done the same Si fecisset idem campo
mediaque palestra Causa fuit iurgi nulla pericle tibi.

In a place of sportes / in field or wrastlyng place
Perycles should have bad / no matter him to blame
Thus time is of sadness / and time is ofsolace
And place is of sadness / and pleasour in like case
The chief point belongyng / to manners and reason
Is ever to consider / place / parson / and season
For like as in an harp / men uses commonly Ergo velut cytharae co^ cordant

Dispyse nor disdain not / thy pore inferyour
And honor thine elders / to them beseruysable
Namely if their lyueng / be worthy of honor
Nor dread not over much / their lokes nor rygour
For what man is fautlesse / what needs him to fear
Often blame may he bide / but nothing can him dear
Therefore / O how greatly: should thou awayte all time O quantum debes turpitu

And with all thy wits / intentyfely give head
That thou may be fautlesse / and clear of syn and crime
For this same thing only / delyuereth man from dread
Love thou not discord / nor stryfes for to feed
But love common concord / as much as is in the
Slake strife and love peace: and fair tranquillyte
Such as in time passed / have taken great labor Qui been gesserunt ia^

To gyde the common well / without diserued blame
Them se that all season / thou worship and honor
And such as now present / also entende the same
Such as of just lyueng / and virtue have clear name
Honor them also / for great is the pleasour
For children to behold / their fathers in honor
And often time young hertes / are kyndled with desire
To deserve like honor: by lyueng virtuous
Like wise as a candell / in flamed is by fire
So youth which of honor / is always desirous
In hope to win honor / does arts glorious
So virtue commended / ryseth to great flame
And young noble hertes / are kyndled with the same
How a ^orayne^ ought to behave him in a strange cyt^e.

Or as thou would esche we / assymy slypper brynke
For like as ill sauers / hurts the heed and brain Na^ quod olet: nare^ lae
dit via lubrica plantas Sed leedunt mores turpia verba bonos.

And as slypper patthes / cast men often to the ground
Right so such vile words / does good manners distayne
And persuyng quyete minds / with hyd and secret wound
Both thought / words / and lyueng / utterly confound
And brefely to conclude / the life of every age
May clearly be iuged / by iesture and langage
How every man ought to medyll on his own faculte.
De qua nil didicit quia quam non art loquatur. Na^ saepe est praesens: q sua
dicta neget.
None ought with any craft / nor science intrem^t
To be busy bablyng / and arguyng the same
Without he have it learned / and be expert in it
For often some is present / not much known by fame
Which in the same science / is worthy have name
And might well such foles words / plain deny
Or here him with silence: and scorn him pryuely
If thou be somewhat expert / in true latyne Graeca paru^ doctus no^ disserat
ore la^^nus. Virgili^ interpres nec quoque graecus erit.

What should thou do bablyng / of strong words of greek
Or if thou have in greek / had all thy discyplyne
To dispute in latin / what needs the to seek
And surely thy lecture / shall scant be worth a leke
If thou take upon the / a comment to compyle
(Knowing little of latin) on Duyd or Uyrgyle
What should a lawier / dyspute of medycyne Qui studu it leges: dimittat de
medici^s Dicere cu^ tantum nescia credat a nus.

Scant would an old wife / to him give audience
A merchaunt to dyspute / against a dyuyne
Were a thing unseemly / and sign of insolence
Let every wyseman: mell with his own science
For who that will meddyll / with every faculte
Is outher a stark fool / or peuysshe proud is he.
Of manners to be kept in going.
Ferthermore in going / a man ought be dilygent Praeterea incessu sua debet
inesse venustas Cum pateat semp omnibus ille palam.

To keep honest manner / and orded comeliness
Sith the same is outward / to all men euydent
And oftyn time the ga^e / does man's mind express
The gate she weth constance / or rasshe unstableness
Men judge sore the pace / for by the same we se
A wild mind unquiet / or prudent grauyte
And brefely the goinge / often does the mind declare Saepe etenim incessus
grauiter cencet ab illo Na^que animi mores saepe videre potes. Non igitur
lentus: no^ sit festinus ametu^ Quem neutra in part dicimus esse nimis.

And plainly expresses / the manners and nature
Wherefore go not dreamyng / nor yet flyenge be ware
Of much hasty or slownesse / both are again nurture
Wherefore bitwene these both / love temperate measure
It is gate uncomely (as does a crane) to stryde
With countenance a lost / which is plain sign of pride
It seems not to iette / with roulyng countenance
With legs and arms: shaking on every side No^ placet: incedas: sicut ^
fercula portant: Nec sicut solita est tra dita sponsa viro.

It seems not in street / as pal^ray to prau^ce
Nor solemly proceed / as we behold a bryde
Led stately to the church / on her chief day of pride
Nor thy pase to temper / I count it not laudable
As men bearyng dysshes / unto a lords table
Nouther is it comely / to ren so hastily No^ tame^: vt nimio cut su defessus:
anheles. Aut capite ^curuo prae cipitatus eas.

That thou pant / as weary / faynted / and fatygate
Nor yet to go droupyng / in manner of a spy
Nor gasyng on the ground: as one infatuate
As in other things / is manner temperate
So in going requires / manner and honest
For by outward iesture / hyd thoughts opyn be.
Of temperaunce in spekyng.
Like wise / as in going / is laud and comeliness Nec minus in verbis
specie^: forma^que decori ^nuenies: laude^ far loquendo potes. Du^ loqueris
socios inter carosque sodales Tu^c insit sermo pressior ore tuo.

So soberly spekyng / with semely grauyte
Thou may find great lauds / and praysyng not the less
Pronounsyng thy words / with humble honest
Among old companyons / if the fortune to be
Or dear faithful friends / proved steadfast and sure
Pronounce than thy speech / low: merry / and demure
But lohan thou must need speak / before a co^monte At cum verba foro facies:
contentio maior-Nis^bus inque aures vox tua missa fluat.

Exalte than thy words: with more contencyon
Or thy right defendyng / speak with audacyte
That men may more plainly / here thine intencyon
Beware / by rasshe words: to raise dissencion
Though thou speak with stomach / pronounce plain and clear
That all may perceive / which shall thy words here
If clear voice to the / be denied of nature Verba tame^ studeas ^clara
expromere voce. Claram natura: tu^ tua cura dabit* Seria si tractas vultus
(...) ^e seueros. Si: leuis quicque: sit tibi front lepos.

By cure and exercise: than do thy self auaunce
If thou speak of sadness / look sadly and demure
If thou speak of sportes / take merry countenance
Use sadness in deeds / and other circumstaunce
Rather than in words / and rather let thy life
She we forth sad grauyte / than countenance pensyfe
Season thou thy speech / with wisdom and prudence Iuditio sueris: plusquam
sermon seuerus. Sit tibi: qua^ vultus: vi ta ^^uera magis. Sit sale conditus
sermo^cedatque libenter C^sortio: and vinci saepe purato decus.

Give place to thy fellow / and harken his wysdom
Sometime is less honor / to speak / than keep silence
And often may thou count / great praise to be overcome
Say troth: nor gloss not* flatter not as do some
With none cory fauell: if thy party be sure
But in thine opinion / observe always measure
Maintain none opinion / in manner obstynate Veridicus fueris: nulli tua verba
secundent. Sed tame^ hac in re deber inesse modus. Nam satis est certe te
dissentire fateri. Cui no^ consentis: desine turpe loqui:

Contend not in words / with such as thou shaltse
Of words superflue / froward and indurate
In co^municacyon / enough is to show the
To contrary party: in mind to dysagre
And where as two other / the list not to consent
yet speak no rebukes / nor words vyolent
When thy self have spoken / here thy companions Ausculta socios: cu^ sis tua
verba locutus. Te solum turpe est o^a velle loqui. Si qs conte^dat (vel sal
sum) cede proterno Iurgia ne forte sint in eunda tibi.

It is against manners / thy self to speak only
Without suffryng any / to thine opinions
To make any answer / to reason or reply
If any keep opinion / contendyng frowardly
Give place for the season / all if his part be wrong
Lest both fall to braulyng / or some strypes among
When any thing is said / not pleasant unto the Non ideo turbes alios audire
volentes: Hoc: quia delectent te re ferenda parum. Quin patiens alios au di:
quecunque loquentes Exeat et seimo ratio^ o^e tuo.

yet trouble thou not other / wyllyng to here the same
For some men has pleasour / and great felycyte
To here that / which other dispyse / refuse / and blame
If thou wylt be counted / of manners and good name
Here other men gladly / what ever they will say
And speak thou as syldom / and little as thou may
Men often have repented / of words superflue
But syldom ofscilence / does any men repent
Wherefore scarce of words / is counted great virtue
And a fool is known / by speech negligent
And to busy babelyng / in words imprudent
If a fool were able / to keep him in scylence
He should be reputed / a man of sapience
Where man is disposed: to words superflue
Not forsyng what he say / but spekyng all by chance Si iuuat aut tristem te
fro^te. vel esse saeue^* (...). No^ damnes illos: quos iuuat esse hilares.

And is full of words / they can not all be true
If thou lust be heavy or sad of countenance
As thy kind requires or used governance
Observe thine own manner / but while thy self art sad
yet blame thou none other / disposed to be glad
Dispyse thou no parson / all if thou purer be Sit iibi co^temptus nemo: quia
purior illo es Co^silio et facto sed ma gis ipse iuua. Dum loqueris: caueas ne
sermo lapsus ab ore Indidet idmorbi: quod tibi cord latet.

Of clothyng / of connyng / of birth / of eloquence
Of riches or ought else / oportune than is he
Rather help him with deed / and counsel of prudence
And while thou art talkyng (give head to this sentence)
Beware that no words / vuwarely fro the start
Dysclosyng hyd fautes / and secret in thy heart
Blame thou no man absent: as detractour unkind Non que^ quam carpes absentem
na^que videris Proditor inca^ti cede re terga viri. Sed spectes eti^: ne sis te
carpe^e visus Du^ damnas illos: quos imitare viros.

For in thy so doing / I the repute semblable
Unto a cowarde teaytour / assaylyng one behind
When his wretched power / in presence is naught able
Beware / lest thou blame thine own self / as culpable
While thou blamest other / for fault that is in the
Whose life thou do follow / in all enormyte
Be no tale berer / use not detraction
Sow not vile seeds / for mayntaynyng discord
Nor paynt not thy langage by adulation Quo scunque alloqueris ^ac vt digneris
honor Nec minimum e plebe spernere visus eris.

Dyspers thou no slanders / in tokyn nor in word
Wysper no new tales / in church / street / nor board
Dispyse no pore parson / with words of rigor
To all men in spekyng / use reverent honor
But rather endeuoyr: thy self in co^munyng Qui potius studeas: omnes videaris
amare. Na^ vere id fertur: non nisi amarus: amat

To seem unto all men / loving and amyable
And prove thy self loving / for proved is this thing
Except him that loves / no man can find love stable
For true is this saying / and oftyn found probable
If thou would find favor / or love: first sow the sede
Show thou love to win love / in word / heart and deed
With fair plesaunt words / wyn favor of all men Cunctoru^ placidis ineu^da
est gratia verbis. Et serua^da vetus semper amicitia est. Non quenquam
interoges acri nec voce minaci. Respo^sum mitis: tu facilisque dabis.

And use thou no words / to break old amyte
With speech win the favor / and so demean the then
To maintain that favor / with true humanite
A friend sone is gotten / kept with difficulte
Demand no question / with words rygorous
And answer / with words demure: and amorous
Commend none ouermoche / with words excessyfe No^ nimis extollas que^ quam.
nec presseris vllum. Laudibus: and vitijs assit vtrisque modus. Sic lauda / aut
da^na: ne possit dicere quisqua^. Iudicij nimiu^ vel boni tatis habe^.

But that thou may after / again him disco^mende
If he fall by fraylnesse-or turn to badder life
Nor none beyond measure-blame nor reprehende
Let not laud nor blamyng / beyond measure extend
But in both use measure-and do that none the call
In any of both parts: to greatly parcyall
Ferthermore in langage-vsurpe thou no delight Insuper idcirco no^ delectabere
lingua: Vulnus in absentes vt iaculere viros. Quisque quam absentes car pentem
signat: and odit: Du^ putat absenti non secus esse sibi.

To wound any person / with words in absence
Nor any out of sight / to slander nor backebyte
For all such as here the / than being in presence
If they have clear reason / wit or intelligence
Shall think that by them / thou shall commyt the same
And when they are from sight / them so backebyte and blame
For as thou do till one / so wylt thou do till other
And that all men marketh / and does thy manners hate No^ tibi bla^diri quenquam
patiare nec vlli Tu blanditus eris: error vterque grauis.

And none shall believe the: all if he were thy brother
But that thou in absence / shall serve him in like rate
Again new I warn the / like as I did but late
Let no man the flatter / nor no man flatter thou
For both is like error / which wysemen dyssalowe
How none should wyn him friends by flatry. Bla^ditus caueas: quam tu merceris
amicos Sed neque blanditus te magis vllus emat. Non plus esse putes: si te quis
landat iniquus Qua^ tibi si causa laudis iniqua foret

Beware / wyn no friends / by mean of flateryng
Ill won and inconstant / shall be such amyte
And such as the flatter / with fair words glosyng
Are not more sure friends / nor more lovers to the
In such feigned frenshyp / is little certaynte
If any wicked person / praise the / set naught thereby
For leude wretches praysyng / is shame and villainy
Therefore count their praysyng / and commendacyon Ascribe ad laude^ vera^
maledicta malorum Summa etenim laus e^ displicuisse malis.

As if thou were not worthy / but as rebuke and blame
Dispyse of ill lyuers / their adulacion
And if they disprayse the / to blame ascribe the same
Their disprayse is praysyng / their praise rebuke and shame
No token can be better / of honest men laudable
Than for to be hated / of vile wretches culpable
When false adulation / with fair words does gloss Difficile est bla^dis ver
bis occludier aures. Egregiu^ imprimis idque refertur opus.

And flatterers does troth: with painted words pall
It is dyffyculte: thine ears than to close
And counted a maistry / and labor princypall
These are the mermaydes / whom men Serenis call
And merueylous monstres / by song and melody
Blind people inducyng: to deedly ieoperde
These flatterers / by whom the world is acloyde No^ puto Syrenas alias quas
spreuit Vlixes Qua^ blandas linguas: sunt ea monstra satis: Semper blanda magis
quam tu maledicta timebis Na^ vitia ostendu^t hac magis illa tegunt.

I count the same monsters / whose gylefull armony
Ulixes dispysed / and manly did, avoid
Him self so preseruyng / and all his company
In flatterers than chyders / count gretter ieoperdy
For chyders and braulers use vices for to blame
But false glosyng flaterers / are wont to cloak the same
A pacyent perceyuyng / his malady and sore Que^ sentit morbu^: me dicari
enititur aege^ At: quem no^ sentit: negligit vnde petit.

Can keep him from danger / of meat co^tagyous
And busy is to puruay / some medecyne therefore
But a sore unknown / is namely ieoperdous
The seek man suspecteth / no matter perylous
For hyd sore prouydyng / no cure nor remedy
Till at last he perysshe / atones suddenly
What sore forth appears / in woman child / or man
Anon is regarded / and lightly is curable Quod patet exterius: facile e^
curabile vulrius Philiriden fallet: quod latet interius.

But hyd sore disceyueth / a wysesurgian
So: found is a blamer / often season profitable
But sweet glosyng flaterers / are always disceyuable
Better to be blamed of friend: that faithful is
Than of a flateryng foe / to have a Judas kiss
Study thou not outward / among the co^monte No^ aliud / quam sis stude as in
plebe videri: Sed neque / quod non est / finxeris esse tibi Non eti a^ referas
tua fortia facta / genusque / Et proauos: quicquid nobilitatis habes.

To seem any other / than thou art inwardly
Nor in thine own conceyt / suppose thou not to be
More better than thou art / for both are like folly
Nor custom not thy self / to bost and magnyfy
Of valyant deeds of kyndred / or richesse
For such vain words / are sign of folysshnesse
It folly is to boste / of kyndred or lynage
The laud is in thy kyn / perchance naught in the
Or to boste of riches / sith fortune is volage
And folly is to boste / of strength or beauty
When sykenesse assayleth / both are but vanyte
It folly is to boste: of such caduke thing
Man only is noble / by virtue or co^nyng
It seems none to be / proclaymer by bostyng No^ decet / vt laudu^ qsquam sit
proeco suarum Nec decet alterius ste mata voce premat Alterius famae dictis no^
liuides obstes Cantator facti sis minus ipse tui.

Of his proper lauds / his precony or name
Nor it is not comely / but very ill syttyng
Another man's deeds / or lynage for to blame
Resyst not with words / another laud and fame
By malice or envy / nor yet in case semblable
Sing not thine own lauds / both are in like culpable
For like as the wise man / dyscloseth not his fault Vt sapie^s nullus populo
sua crimina vulgat. Sic neque virtutes predicat ille suas.

Nor his vice bewrays: before the co^monte
Right so he is well ware / with words proud and haute
To preche forth his virtues: exalted for to be
For this is a proverb / soundyng to veryte
Of thy proper mouth / thy laud is not laudale
But other men's praise: is greatly commendable
Such bostyng besemeth / a braynles soudyour Na^ laus (vt fertur) pro prio
sordescit in ore / Praesertim falsa: milite digna leui.

Which scarsly durst reaue / young chykens from an hen
Such crakyng declares / an heart of small valor
For the greattest crakers / are not the boldest men
Some think them good enough / to fight with. ix. or ten
But if one scoldyng queen / fought with him hand to hand
He were not so manfull / he dystaffe to withstand
Therefore / cesse thy crakyng / and order thy lyueng Sed magis id facito / quo
tu referaris ab oi^ / Ductus in exemplu^: posteritate tua. At / sua ^ ^atuus
diunigat crimina multis Omnibus hic iure creditur esse furens.

In doing manly deeds / according to virtue
That such as come after / and all thy hole offprynke
May se good example / thine acts to ensue
But certainly that fool / which does his fautes show
To many / as bostyng / or ioyeng in the same
Of all may be counted / a madman without shame
(...) wh^ver such a role / (...) him o^ (...) ^^ seu falsa ferat de (...) seu
crimina vera: Dignior est poena dignior ille cruce.

Always is he worthy / of utter punysshment
For if his life be such / as bostyng he does show
Than well he deserves / the galous for tourment
But if he boste of vice / yet be Juge innocent
yet the wretch is worthy / of punysshment and care
For who sclaundreth himself / whom other can he spare
How man may laufully manifest his own virtue: without arroga^s or pride
But this not withstandyng / unknown if thou be Si tame^ acciderit quam fi^
ignotus: et ipsa Sint tua: tunc parcue illa refer potes. Fac nosca^t hoies:
fuerit tibi siqua faculta^. Ne tame^ ijs fiat illa molesta: vide.

And if people know not / thy con^yng and science
Thou may the same show forth / if it be true in the
But beware (in showing) of pride and insolence
Of any faculte / if thou have experience
Do that men may know it / but ^e well as thou can
That the same be noisome / or grievous to no man
By bostyng of the same / or other business Nemo etenim accens^ posuit sub
cord luce^nam. Aut oculos propius* quam decet esse locat*

Unto their displeasure / or quietness contrary
As by this example / thou may perceive express
Non closes in a corner / a kyndled lumynary
Nor over nere the eyes / the same / again does carry
Between both is measure / so hyde not thy connyng
Nor show it not to much / by crakyng or bostyng
yet such as inhabyte / among neighbors unkind
May praise his own gifts / and his own part defend
For envy and malice / so many wretches does blind
That else should non at al / his virtues commend
But beyond his bonds / he should not him extend
Lest his gifts known: heap / and augment envy
And cause him live after / much more unquietly
Of vain glory not to be coueted.
Sith all worldly glory / is small and transitory Gloria nam studio non est
tibi vana petenda* Non sapit is: sicui gloria vana placet. At vana est oisquia:
quicqd gessimus ipsi / No^ nos sed su^mus dux suit ipse deus.

And all holy lyuers / the same / in heart dispyse
Therefore thou ought not / to study for vain glory
What man it desires / ought not be counted wise
But vain is all glory / now have I told the twyse
For what good we wretches do / any time or tide
Our self it perform not / but god which is our gyde
And therefore all glory / all praise / laud and honor Propterea e^ omnis coe
lesti debita patri: Gloria sic Christi dice responsa docet. Immeritis igi^
nobis est siqua tributa: Haec poterit vana dicie^ atque leuis.

As dew to the father / hye and celestyall
So teaches holy church / spouse of our savior
Wherefore if glory / or honor temporal
Be given here in earth / to be people mortal
Such honor and glory / may well be called vain
As waynyng and fadyng / not able to remain
(...) At Ti que obiur^^^: cura ne percitus ira Sis visus: sed quam ductus a
more facis.

If thou be constrained / any person to blame
Do that thou not seem / for wrath him to reprove
But with all demureness / behave the in the same
As not led by malice: but rather of good love
Often time a great blamer / is little for behoue
But rather makes worse / by to great cruelte
Where as a merry blamer: is great vtylyte
To the frail offender / by countenance demure Saepe nihil prodest ni^^^
reprehe^ for acerbus Plus prodest hilaris: na^ magis ille docet. Errori veniam
facilis donabis: et illi Non dandam dices: si repetitus erit.

So glad chere does profit / when ire rages in vain
Be light to forgyuenesse / and bid gylty be sure
Not to have like mercy / if they trespass again
If thou love the sinner: and word can not constrayne
Him to cesse his folly / than vs^ thou more rygour
As fetters or prison / to sober his furour
Better is to suffer / him for a time to smerte Si neque verba valent: and
carior ipse reprensus: Vtere carceribus: conpede stringe pedes Non nimiu^ long
fueris iurgando profectus Inter di^iu^ctos acrior esse cave.

Than wander vncor^ect / to manyfolde error
And after se him end / with sad and woeful heart
To his own confusion / and friends dishonor
Nor go thou not to far / blamyng with words sour
Or ragyng and chydyng / for any crime or sin
Namely against such / as are not of thy ^ynne
If thou be wise / follow the manner what thou can Si sapias: medicos iu^^ gans
imitare peritos Qui tantum: vt ^anent putrida me^bra secant. Sic tu quo prosis:
prudenter corripe car^^. No^ odiu^ queras: dum male facta refers.

Of a wise phesician: or leche experient
For deed flesh they cut out / of woman child or man
In most easy manner / only for this intent
To restore unto health / the paynfull pacyent
So blame thou with wisdom / thy friend above all thing
Lest thou wyn but hatred / by rygorous chydyng
Aduert glass is brytell / but yren stele and brass Ergo si^ hoc caro: ^u^que
est^iniu^ia cesset. Sit tu^c: cu^ melior nulla relicta via est.

Endures great strokes / or they receive figure
But the cryspyng yren / suffyseth brytell glass
So man must be treated / as seems their nature
Some roughly / some myloly / with fair words demure
Therefore blame but seldom / and without injury
And that when thou see: none other remedy
How he which is blamyd for his fault / ought behave him self.
Again / if another the blame or reprehende Si qs te co^tra moneat patiare
monentem. Qui monet vt pro^it: non grave dicta feras. Na^ si te metito iurgauit
profuit ille. Sin min^: is voluit vti lis esse tibi.

Or warn the of thy fault / endure him pacyently
If he warn thy profit / to his words entende
Bear not his rebukes / nor words heuely
For if thou haste mysdome / of blame art thou worthy
So did he the profit / if thou be not culpable
yet thought he unto the / for to be profitable
This wy^^ / (...) and (...) h^^ good mind
And not worse art thou / reb^^^e^ innocent
And certesse it is better / sharp words and unkind
To suffer of a friend: spoken for good intent
Than of a fo to have / fair speech and fraudulent
The one would thy profit / all if he seem not so
But often glosed langage / cloketh a mortal fo
How man ought behave him self anenst his enmyes. Te siqua^do procax in^
micus dente lacessit: Vtere et aduersus hu^c grauitate tua.

If any testy foes / joined as burre to burre
Assail the by malice / to wrath prouokyng the
Grynnyng and gnarryng: as does a butchers curre
For get thou not suffrance / nor thine old grauyte
Disdain thou such wretches / outher to here or se
Sith such want good manners / all reason and wisdom
One (shall) them dispysyng / in best manner overcome
O / how much has grieved / a subtle for mortal Heu qua^tum nocu^t sine
ferro callidus hosti^ Si facit: vt solita tu grauitate cadas No^ quicqua^
indignum sancto tibi decidat o^e Qua^u^^ ille canis improba verba latet.

Without sword or weapen / yfhe by words fell
From thy wont grauyte / constrayne the to fall
Wherefore / if thou be wise / work after my counsel
Here not that scolder / and braulyng hounde of hell
Though his mouth by malice: braulyng do foam and blede
Let no word unworthy / out of thy mouth proceed.
Of manner to be kept in spekyng. Praeterea intendas. ne sermo longius erret.
Digressus propera / luce reuerte domum Prospice / ne quis^ dicat ia^ luce
propinqua: Iam ta^dem ad causam propositumque redi.

Further more intend thou / that thou in co^munyng
Err not from thy purpose / to far / in words vain
If thou make digression / go not so far wandryng
But that thou may to purpose / by light return again
Lest some in derysion / warn the in words plain
Saying / sir consider: it draws fast to night
At last draw to purpose / return while it is light
Now brefely concludyng / when thou shall fel^ and se Denique / cum sentis
socios sermon grauari^ Desine ne pergas longiu^ esse grauis.

Thy long speech tedyous / to thy fellows present
Cesse / and proceed no more tedious for to be
For short song and pleasant / is most convenient
And short tale commended / is best of men prudent
As small meat provoke / a gredy appetyte
So short speth? gives / to herers most delight
Of measure to be kept in curyosyte of mancions.
Desyr^ thou not to dwell / in curyous buyldyng No^ habitesoedes: pictu ra / et
marmore culta^ Sed salubrem cures it coluisse domum.

Of marble and pycture / or grauyng curyous
Such buyldyng besemeth / an emperouror king
But before all other / it seems gods house
Often time the house shows / proud mind glorious
Wherefore / seek in housyng / wholesome co^modyte
Rather than proud buyldyng / or curyosite
And wheder thou shall bylde / hit other hyre thy house (...) seu tu fabricas
pcio seu suscipis empta^. Aspice: quale^ vsus exigit ipse tuus. Nam domus
humanos cum solum fiat in vsus Assit dumtaxat vsibus apta tuis.

Mark if it be needful / and competent to the
Seek more ease and profit / than grauyng glorious
Sith houses are builded / for man's necessyte
And only for man's use / and co^modite
Prepare thine abydyng / and habytacyon
After thy need / thine use and occupacyon
Nor seek thou not pleasure / in comely apparayle Nec tibi decult; domibus
quaere^da voluptas Sed magis e cella est interiora tua.

In deckyng thine houses / with costly ornament
In outward ornament / is pomp and small avail
First garnysshe and cleanse / the house of thine intent
Than cleanse thy bedchamber / from all displesant sent
In a little parler / clean / and of sweet odor
Is room sufficient / and plenty of pleasour
Ha^c si mu^dabis: miros tibi fundet odores Sum voluptates: quod cupis inde
tibi. Cu^que domo verses no^ toto tempore vitae In cella maneas noctibus atque
die. Propterea assyrio cures ha^c spargere odore Haec cures: omni quo decoretur
open*
For in thine outward house / thou seldom do frequent
In chamber thou restest: often time both day and night
And therefore / it garnysshe / with herbs redolent
And with fragrant odours / thy spyryte for to light
Make it sweet in odor / and comely unto sight
That this thy pleasant cell / adourned in best wise
May declare the clennesse / and fulfill the suffyse
Therefore / the householder / and master of the house No^ igitur dominus
pulchra noscatur ab aede. Sed domus a domino sit celebrata suo. No^ decet: vt
totus tibi sple^dor ab aede petat^. Sple^dorem domini sed iuuet ipsa domus.

Ought not to be noted / by sumptuous buyldyng
Nor by outward grauyng / or warkes curyouse
But let the house be lauded / more after his lyueng
Unto thy laud and honor / it is but little thing
That on thy fair buyldyng: thy name should hole depede
yet the buyldyng somewhat: the master may commend
Let not this old sentence, which people often frequent No^ queat illa freque^s
in te sentencia dici. Qua^ dispar dominus est tibi prisca domus* Saepe ego
dicentes audiui tempore nostro. Heu antiqua domus: quam tibi dispar herus.

Against the be spoken / which is this to record
O noble mancyon / O house most ancient
How greatly unto the: discordyng is thy lord
For often in my time / my self have hard this word
Alas noble buyldyng / house of antiquyte
How much is thy master / and lord unlike to the
All things here spoken / of buyldyng curyous No^ etia^ condas maiora palacia
tuti: Qua^: modo praescriptus ^ictet in aede modus.

Concerning the City / thou must them understand
In likewise forbyddyng / great buyldyng sumptuous
And houses superflue / in country or vplande
For of many folyes / this one I count most fond
To build costly cages / in forest / park or wode
Which not to no man nor be / can finally do good
Of manner to be observed in iesture and cou^tenau^ce. Sic manuum gestns: sic
os: oculosque gubernes: Indiciu^ vt prestes: qua liter intus habes. Quos aute^
gestus aliorum ducis ineptos: In te creed illos posse placere minus.

So govern thy iesture / of body foot and hand
Of countenance / eyes / and mouth / with fair semblau^ce
That who the beholds / may se and understand
Thine inward behauour / by outward countenance
And where thou see other / of fro ward governance
And iesture dyshonest: against nurture and skyll
Consider that like iesture / should the beseme as ill
And whom thou reputest well maneted dispose the At / si quid dubitas: fidos
tibi co^ sule amicos Vt: quic quid peccas te monuisse velint Sic faciu^t docti
pictores / sicque poetae. Interroga^t alios: quale videtur opus.

Their manners to follow / in manerly iesture
And if thou in norture / dread of incertaynte
Take counsel of friends / proved loving and sure
So poets and paynters: in verses and pycture
Take counsel of other / inquyryng their sentence
To their own co^ceyte / before they give credence
Of honest occupacio^s to be used convenient to man's state.
In like wise behave the / and this in any wise Sed neque tu cupidus tur pes
sectaberis arts: Multarum vt dominus e^^ciaris opum. Sed pariter f^gias quae
sordida lucra para^tur: Na^que odij causas / inui diamque parant.

I warn the to beware / of arts of vileness
Or foul occupacyon / to haunt or exercise
By wretched couetyse / to gather great richesse
Fly lucre dishonest / by frauds or falsenesse
Uyle lucre is lothsom / both unto good and man
And causes the getter / often ryme his purpose ban
For thereby is the soul / in danger for to spyll
And the same defiled / with name of vylany
And man wynneth hatred / hyd rancour and ylwyll
Therefore / namely fly thou the spot of symony
And all manner branches: of cloked vsery
By frauds and falshod / do not thy good extend
For goods falsely gotten / come syldome to good end
Wherefore be no toller / catchepoll / nor customer Quare non custos portus: no^
foenoris auctor No^ lanius: caupo^ sordet id omne genus.

No broker nor botcher / no somner nor sergiaun:
Be thou none Inholder: hosteler / nor tauernet
No bryggyng exchetour / nor yet baylyf erraunt
An Offyciall or Shirife / are honest but right skant
The most of this number / lives by double tollyng
By cloked extorcyon / by frauds and by pollyng
Wherefore / these and other / unto them semblable Et sordent omnes / quo ^um
non artis emetur Ingenium / sed opus: id genus omne fuge.

Ar vile business / hurtyng both name and thought
And all such crafts are vile / and skant laudable
Whose warke (and not co^nyng) is used or yet bought
In shoppes or insale / of good co^nyng is naught
Nor yet wit nor wysdom / but g^le and subtylte
Where dysc^yte is wysdom / there is no honest
Nor naught is praise worthy / in crafty cokery Nil habet ingenij: gequid
vulgata taberna Exposuit: quaeque e^ pro^p ta popina gulae. Alea: saltator
servant nil prorsus honesti.

By saved equity / and meats prodigal
Kyndlyng carnal lusts / by mean of glotony
The dyse are damnable / and fury infernal
Uayne daunsyng is noryse / to vile lusts carnal
Uyle ioglers and pypers / by wanton melody
And songs excyteth / youth often to rybaudy
A poor pety merchant / or peddler is but vile Mercator tenuis: sordi dus ipse
quoque est. Quisquis emit merces illas subitoque reuendit Periurus / vanus
semper is esse solet Nil autem vano: and per iuto turpius extat Na^que homines
fraudat negligit ille deos At si market or magnus sit mercis opimae: Vt puto
no^ magno ver titur ille probro. Hic quoque laudari poterit si plenus: ad agros
Se tantem verte^s: agri cola esse cupit.

And such as now being / retayle anon again
These comely frequent / fraud / perjury / and gyle
And hard is from lyeng / their tongues to refrain
Than a vain periurer / nonght is more vile certain
For him self forsweryng / by wretched couetyse
Both men he defraudeth / and god does he dispyse
But a famous merchant: great / rich / and habundant
And ryghtwysely dealyng / is not vituperable
But worthy with great rulers / for to be conversant
As to court and Cite / needful and profitable
But yet such a merchant / is counted more laudable
To leave court and City / when he has full enough
And to be an husband / to gyde the wayne and plough
For among all crafts / and worldly business Nil melius cultu tertae nil
dignius illa Quae pauca accipiens: plurima donat hero.

No thing is more lauded / than tyslyng of the ground
Whichefor little labor / yeldeth great richesse
And small sede receyuyng / causes the lord abound
In plentye / wherewith all / both he / and his are found
And holsom unto body / is this same exercise
And also to the soul / quenchyng the rote of vice
Whylom the great Romans / most mighty conquerous
To whom all the world / was made subject and bound Hanc quondam mundi
victores / ture modesto Vtere / cu^ propria non rubuere manu.

Were nothing ashamed / to take the same labors
With their propre hands / to turn and dygge the ground
And often such fathers / were in the fyldes found
That diverse were called / from plough to the empire
At princes requests / and commons great desire
Some of homely plowmen / just / simple / and rural Curia conscriptos patres
cogebat ab agris.

Made over the hole world / most worthy emperors
And some other called / to diguyte royal
As Dictatours / Consuls / and prudent Senators
Which after great acts / and deserved honors
Have left their great lordshyp / and after were right feign
Unto the quyete fyldes / and plough to turn again
Thus the romayne laws / constrained men rural
For sober behauour / and wise frugalyte
From ploughe to be princes / in rowm imperyall Qusque hodie est consulante
bubulcus erat.

So some / the one day / lyfted to great auctoryte
Was yester an heerd / content with pouerte
Thus of all labors / and every exercise
The tylmanes labors / is counted of most price
Among artyficers / the wysesurgian Artifices inter medicus laudatur: et archi
Tectus: qui fabros aedificare docet,

Is lauded not a little / and for necessyte
And not less is lauded / the good phesician
And lawier which leans / to right and equity
Masons / carpenters: and other such as be
For man's life needful: and greatly profitable
May welbe admytted / as crafts commendable
But no manner science / no craft nor exercise
Can be in it own self / so good and necessary
But that may be blamed / and obscured by vice
If the same be used / wrong and to way contrary
In all thing discression / is gyde and lumynary
It weke thing susteyneth / and lyghtneth obscure
And all thing derecteth / in order and measure
Desire thou none office / nor cure in any wise Officij exactor no^ sis: si
redditur vltro Gratia: no^ segnis ipse receptor eris No^ cito credideris vul go
quaecunque feruntur. Saepe fuit falsum quod mala lingua refert

If it vnrequyred: be given unto the
If thou think the able / do not the same dispyse
And thank thou the gyuer / with dew humanyte
Give thou not sone crede^ce / to voice of co^monte
For often time ill tongues / confederate apply
Of customed malice / to flatter or to lie
And leude under color / of plain simplicite Saepe mali queru^t sub nomine
simplicitatis: Du^ referunt falsa: praecipitare bonos. Artibus istoru^ /
quantu^ potes ipse resist Despice / quae dicu^t: despice quae faciunt.

Composyng their lies / often times craftily
Supplanteth good people / and men of honest
This is their chief study / and fendly polycy
Resyst thou such wretches / and their words de^ye
Dispyse thou what they say / and their deeds dispyse
For all is but flattery / or gyle that they deuyse
Show thy self most humble / most deboner and mylde Te placidu^ studeas
rebus praestare secundis. Nam magis id debes: quo magis ipse potes. At / si
sint tenues tibi res solatia quaeras Nec fueris visus omni bus esse miser.

When most wealth and riches / shall unto the abound
Than be thou most curtayse / to man / woman / and child
For the more thou may / more straytly art thou bound
And though thou have but little / yet fall not to yt ground
Take comfort to thy self / in hope of better speed
Nor let not all men know / thy mysery and need
When thy self be waylest / thy need and mysery No tua cu^ doleas: alio rum
co^moda narres. Ne videare suis inuidus esse bonis. Discere semper ama: nec sit
tibi maxima cura. A quo tu discas: sit didicisse satis.

Common not of others / wealth / ease / and quietness
Lest thou seem to murmur / by malice and envy
Against others fortune / health / honor / and richesse
Love ever for to learn / ware wysdom and goodness
Nor of whom thou lernest / thou nedest not discern
Let it full suffyce the / good manners for to learn
And what thou have learned / teache thou the same again Quod nosti: doceas
alios: id scire volentes Sis memor ex alijs te didicisse prius.

To such as lernyng cou^teth treasour and store
On obstynate dullardes / break not thy wit and brain
In apt minds / co^nyng / declared / waxes more
Remember of other / thy self learned before
So let other of the: So learned may delate
Nor make not fre science / to many subiugate
Now my muse Thalia / assyne me to conclude Iamque operi fine^ nostro
praescribe Thalia. Tempore: quae supera^t co^mediore canes. Da venia^ lector si
sum nimis ipse profectus Na^ nisi prodesse: nil mea musa cupit.

This my present labor / and instant business
And what thing remains / with moresolycytude
In time more oportune / I gladly shall express
But good reder pardon / my tedyous rudeness
For only my purpose / is iuuent to profyce
And young tender minds / to manners to exyte
For as a rased table / with white coler alayde
Is ready to receive / all manner of pycture
So youth is disposed / as commonly is said
To all good or ill manners / as men put them in ure
But though unto the worst / youth leans of nature
yet a erthen vessel / is ever sweet or sour
And after still keeps / taste of the first lycour
Which men at beginning / for season put therein
So wild youth abused / first with frail plesours blind
Long after his proner / and redyer to syn
For folly by custom / often turns unto blind
That none holsom doctrine / can raze it fro thy mind
Wherefore: O tender youth / look on this small treatise
And leave barayne balades / mouynge the mind to vice
Read this little treatyce / O iuuent of England
As myrour of good manners: ye chefely of London
And when ye it redyng / shall perfyte understand
Give ye laud and thanks / to Gyles Alyngton
Knight / at whose precept / this treatise was begone
If this do you profit / that shall my mind excyte
Of mo fruitful matters / after this to write.
Finis.
Thus ends the right fruitful matter of the four Uertues cardynall:
Imprynted by Rychard Pynson: pryn ter unto the kings noble grace: with his
gracyous pryuylege / the which book I have prynted / at the instance and
request / of the right noble Rychard yerle of Kent.
