TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL AND WORthy Gentleman, Sir JOHN LEVINTHORPE Knight
perpetual Happiness and Content.
IT is not unknown unto your well deserving self, Right Worshipful, that not
long since I took my Ultimum vale, with a resolving in my self, never to
publish any works of the same Nature and Fashion, whereupon I betook me to
the ease of my Pillow, where Somnus having taken possession of my eyes, and
Morpheus the charge of my senses; it happened me to fall into a Musical
dream, wherein I chanced to have many opinions and extrauagant humors of
diverse Natures and Conditions, some of modest mirth, some of amorcus Love, and
some of most divine contemplation; all these I hope, shall not give any
distaste to the ears, or dislike to the mind, either in their words, or in
their sever all sounds, although it is not necessary to relate or diuulge all
Dreams or Fantasies that Opinion begets in sleep, or happens to the minds
appar^tion. And continuing long in this my dreaming slumber, I began to awake,
and upon my eyes vnclosing, I bethought my self, being full awaked, aduising
in my mind, whom to elect and choose as a Patron for the same, I was easily
invited to make choice of your Worship, as one to whom I necessarily ought
both love and duty, And howsoever I might fear that you will not acknowledge
it, yet in that Nature has enriched you with more then ordinary knowledge in
this Art, being a witness of that Love which you have always afforded to
Music, I emboldened my self the rather to present it unto you. Accept it
then (good Sir) as a Token of unfeigned Love, and a debt worthily due unto you
for your many favors done to him that is

At your Worships command. ROBERT JONES.

To all Musical Murmurers, This Greeting.
THou, whose ear itches with the variety of opinion, hearing thine own
sound, as the Ecchoe reuerberating others substance, and unprofitable in it
self, shows to the World comfortable noise, though to thy own use little
pleasure, by reason of uncharitable censure. I speak to thee musical Momus,
thou from whose nicetie, numbers as easily pass, as drops fall in the shower,
but with less profit. I compare thee to the hie way dust that flies into men's
eyes, and will not thence without much trouble, for thou in thy dispersed
judgment, not only art offensive to seeing knowledge, but most faulty false
to deserving industry, picking moates out of the most pure Bisse, and smoothing
the plainest velvet, when only thine own opinion is more wrinckled and more
vicious in it self, then grosser soil, so that as a brush infected with
filth, thou rather soylest then make perfect any way. I have stood at thine
elbow, and heard thee profane even Musickes best Note, and with thy vntunde
relish Sol Fade most ignobly. I am assured, and I care not greatly, that thou will lay to my charge, my whilome vow, Never again, because I promised as
much: but understand me thou vns kilfull descanter, derive from that Note of
Plain Song charitable numbers, and thou shall find harsh voices are often a
Note above Ela reduced by truer judgment, which I bereave thee of, knowing thy
Rules, are as our new come Lutes, being of many stringes, not easily used,
unless in adventure, till practice put forward into deserving Division. This
my adventure is no deed but a dream, and what are dreams, but airie
possessions, and several airs, breathing harmonious whisperings, though to
thee discord, yet to others indifferent, I will not say excellent, because it
is an others office not mine, but let them be as they are, others profits and
my pains, set forth for pleasure, not for purposed poison to infect
imagination, no, but as a shower falling in a needful season, so I flatter my
self at least, and will say so ever by any other, whose labor shall vplift
Musical meditation, the only wing of true courage, being the most pleasing
voice of man, whose sweetenes reaches unto heaven it self. It is hard if all this pains reap not good commendations, and it is water wrung out of a Flint
in thee, since thou never think well of any, and were in thy self so
unskillful ever, as thy Tutor from the first hour could never make thee sing
in Tune; be as thou art a lump of deformity without fashion, bredde in the
bowels of disdain, and brought forth by bewitched Megaera, the fatal Widwife
to all true merit.

Give me leave to depart, or if not, without it I am gone, careless of thy
censuring, and fully persuaded thou can not think well, and therefore art
cursed in thy Cradle, never to be but cruel, and being borne with teeth in thy
head, bitst every one harmeles in this or what else honest industry, makes thy
earegossip too.

Farewell if thou will in kindness, or hold thy self from further carping.
A TABLE CONtaining all the Songs in this Book.
THough your strangenes frets my heart, 1 Sweet Kate of lateranne away, 2 Once

You Will swear I hold your heart,
Whilst my rival close does stand,
And I sit far apart,

Hid in your bosom as you say,

4
Would a rival then I were,
Some else your secret friend,
So much lesser should I fear,
And not so much attend,
They enjoy you every one,
Yet must I seem your friend alone,

But their hopes attaind,
They bewray they faind,
And their oaths are kept at leisure.

Her words
Like swords,
Cut my sorry heart in sunder,
Her floutes,
With doubts,
Kept my heart affections under.

Stands in awe of once denying,
Cause I had enough,
To become more rough,
So I did, O happy trying.

She who knew that backward dealing,
was a foe to forward longing,
To avoid her own hearts wronging,
with a sigh loves suit revealing.
Said locky sweet when you would dally,
Do you cry sweet, shall I shall I.

Iocky knew by her replying,
That a no is I in wooing,
That an asking without doing,
Is the way to loves denying.
Now he knows when he would dally
How to spare sweet shall I shall I.

Confusions mase,
A flouring grass,
Temple of treachery,
Soul yoke to misery,
Storehouse of hell
Farewell, farewell.

wish I could not see or from my self might flee. ^

Mine eyes for refuge then with zeal befixe the skies,
My tears do cloud those eyes,
My sighs do blow them dry,
And yet I live to die,
My self I cannot fly,

Heavens I implore, that knows my fault, what shall I do,
To hell I dare not go,
The world first made me rue,
My self my griefs renew,
To whom then shall I sue.

Alas; my soul does faint to draw this doubtful breath,
Is thereno hope in death,
Oyes, death end my woes:
Death me from me will lose,
My self am all my foes.

Those eyes two pointed Diamonds did engraue,
Within my heart the true and lively form,
Of that sweet Saint whose pity most I crave,
Whose absence makes me comfortless to mourn,
And sighing say (Sweet) would she knew my love,
My plaints perhaps her mind may somewhat move.
3
But if she knew, what if she did reject,
Yet better twere by her sweet doom to die,
That she might know my dear loves true effect,
Then thus to live in unknown misery,
Yet after death it may be she would say,
His too much love did work his lives decay.
