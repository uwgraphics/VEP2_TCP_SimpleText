TWO SERMONS upon 1. Peter 5. verse. 8. and 9. Wherein is showed that the
devil is to be resisted only by a steadfast faith, how soever he comes either
against soul or body: and that whosoever has once attained the true and
lively faith, it can never be utterly lost, but he is sure to get the victory.

LONDON, Printed by Felix Kingston, for Thomas Man. 1597.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL M. Joseph Bainham Esquire, and to Mistress Ione
Bainham his Wife.
SIR, when J call to mind the reverent and holy memory of that godly Martyr
both of your name, country, and house, M. James Bainham, who died most
constantly for the truth of the Gospel, as we have his story at large
described in M. Fox, page 1030. and consider withal the great mercy of God,
in continuing still unto that Worshipful name and stock, the same light of
faith, and zeal of the truth, and holiness of profession: J nothing doubt to
say unto you, as sometime the holy Apostle wrote unto Timothy, When I call to
remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy
Grandmother Lois, and in thy Mother Eunice, and am assured that it dwells in
thee also, 2. Tim. 1.5. So it cannot be but a great joy and comfort to those
that fear God, to see the posterity of Martyrs, to retain still the holy
faith and profession of Martyrs: not only to be of their earthly lineage, but of
the spiritual kindred also: not to be next them only in generation, but to
follow them in regeneration. And this example of your own cloth, as it is unto
us an occasion of rejoicing, so to you it must serve, not as a spur to prick
you, but as a star to direct you, and a line to lead and draw you forward to
al holy increase of faith and zeal. That holy man, as he was virtuous in his
life, devout in prayer, sound in faith, patient in his afflictions; so most of
all was he constant and cheerful in his death: who in the midst of his
torments, and out of the raging flames of fire, thus spoke with a comfortable
and heavenly voice: O ye Papists, behold, ye look for miracles, and here now
you may see a miracle, for in this fire I feel no more pain, then if I were
in a bed of down: but it is to me as sweet as a bed of Roses. How ought we
now to honor the memory of this blessed man, and how much are you to praise
God, that has given you out of your worshipful house so worthy an example
and encouragement to all Christian proceeding? J say again with the same
Apostle. Wherefore I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God
in you, etc. 2. Timoth. 1.6. And J doubt not, but that as it is true generally
in the Church: Sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiae: the blood of the Martyrs is
the seed of the Church: so more especially in your family, that it has been
blessed of God, and made fruitful, being seasoned as it were by the blood of
so holy a man. Saint Ambrose says, Passio Christi sufficit ad salutem, passio
Martyrum contulit ad exemplum: Christ's death sufficient to salvation, the
Martyrs death is effectual for example and instruction. You have both Christ's
holy passion to save you, and this Martyrs worthy example and confession to
instruct you. The memory of this excellent man gave me occasion to present
this Sermon unto you, which came to my hands, which contains a profession of
the same faith for the which he dyed, in you reuerencing his remembrance, and
honoring his faith: God grant us all the like zeal and holiness in our lives,
that we may have the like comfort and cheerefulnes in our end.

Your Worships welwiller in the Lord, Thomas Man.

TWO SERMONS UPON THE 1. Peter 5. verse. 8. and 9. Wherein is showed that the
devil is to be resisted only by a steadfast faith, how soever he comes either
against soul or body: and that whosoever has once attained the true and
lively faith, it can never be utterly lost, but he is sure to get the
victory.
The first Sermon.
Be sober and watch: for your adversary the devil, as a roaring Lion walks
about, seeking who^ he may devour: whom resist steadfast in the faith. 1. Pet.
5. verse. 8.9.


BLessed Peter an Apostle of Jesus Christ, 1. Pet. 1.1
wrote this Epistle to the Christian Jews which dwelt as strangers dispersed
here and there in sundry countries, as in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
and Bithynia. For the ten tribes were scattered of old time, and had dwelt long
among the Gentiles in many kingdoms, being carried away by Shalmaneser king of
Ashur, out of their own land, as we read 2. King. 17. And of somewhat later
times many of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin were also dispersed among the
heathen: so that S. James wrote his epistle in like manner to the twelve tribes
which were in the dispersion, James 1. ver. 1. These dispersed Jews came up
out of all lands at certain solemn feasts, unto Jerusalem for to worship
there according to the law of Moses and there had they heard the Apostles
preach Christ, as ye may see by that which is written Act. 2. and believed in
him: and unto them that so believed S. James and S. Peter directed their
Epistles. Touching the matters handled in this Epistle of Peter, we are to note
that the holy Apostle deals principally about the duties of christian life:
as namely, the times being then full of troubles and terror of persecutions,
he labors to make them bold, patient, constant and cheerful in all
afflictions and sufferinges, which they were to pass through to come to the
partaking of the heavenly glory with Christ. Also he uses many grave and
forcible reasons to move them unto true holiness, even to walk in the
virtues of the spirit of grace, and to bring forth fruits worthy of so high
a calling. But first of all he opens as it were the fountain and beginning
of all good actions in man, that is, how God of his great mercy had chosen
them, and begotten them in Christ to be his children and heirs of glory.
Among these persuasions, admonitions, and exhortations of the Apostle, this is
one which I have read unto you, and which I am now to handle. It may be
divided into three parts: Of which the first is an admonition, or an
exhortation, whereby he stirs up all the faithful unto sobriety and
watchfulnes, in these words, Be sober and watch. The second part shows what
cause there is to moan all men unto this sobriety and watchfulnes, or how much
it stands them every way upon, seeing they have so terrible and so cruel an
adversary, who continually seeks their eternal woe and destruction: which
is in these words: For your adversary the devil, as a roaring Lion walks
about, seeking whom he may devour. The third and last part does teach how
we shall withstand him, overcome him, and put him to flight, that so we may
escape from his cruel tyranny: which is in these words, Whom resist steadfast
in the faith. All men may easily see, that the matter which we have here to
deal in, is of the greatest moment. If a man have lands or goods, and
perceive that he has an adversary which lies in wait, and seeks to deprive
him of the same, it will move him to take heed, and it will set him on work,
to seek all the ways and means he can to learn how he may defend and hold
his right. If a man do know that his enemy does continually seek all
opportunity and all occasions how he may set upon him unawares, and with the
greatest advantages he can, to take away his life: will he not watch and take
heed? yea will be not be glad to learn how he may so arm and strengthen
himself that he may withst and his said cruel enemy when he comes? Here
is a far greater matter, not the loss of goods or lands, or of this frail
life, but the destruction of both body and soul in eternal damnation, which
is sought by a very mighty, subtle and cruel enemy. I know therefore that
so many as have any spark of true wisdom, will be very attentive to hearken to
this exhortation of the Apostle, and willing to learn how they may be kept
safe from so great a danger. For how soolish a thing is it, that we should be
so careful to beware of men, that they may not harm us, which is but in
lighter matters, and in the mean time have no regard how to beware of devils,
which seek our eternal woe and misery? Hearken therefore (beloved) unto this
wholesome instruction: for now will I come to handle every member by it self.

Be sober and watch. Watching to this end that we may keep our selves out of
danger, is the chief and principal matter of this exhortation: and because no
man can be fit to watch unless he be sober, he joins them both together,
and says unto us, Be sober and watch. It is in vain to call upon drunken men
to watch, for sleep will soon oppress them: he that is sober, he may watch:
Be sober therefore (says the Apostle) and watch. For our further instruction
in this point, we are to remember, that there be two kinds of drunkenness,
two kinds of soberness, two sorts of sleeping, and two sorts of watching,
the one of the boby, the other of the mind. He that with excess and ryote
powers in wine and strong drink until he be drunken, his senses are then
oppressed, drowsmesse comes upon him, and he falls into a sound sleep, his
adversary may come upon him and do unto him what he will: this we all know to
be true. He that keeps himself in sobriety, and is not overcome with wine
or strong drink, but uses them moderately, he can, if need be, watch for to
eschew and withstand perilles and dangers. Now as the body is made drunken
with wine, or strong drink, so is the mind oppressed and made drunken with
earthly cares, with carnal pleasures, with evil lusts and vain delights,
which bring a drowsinesse upon it and a dead sleep, so that the spiritual
enemy may come unto it at pleasure to do what he will. On the contrary part
he that keeps his mind sober touching those cares and pleasures, so that he
is not oppressed nor drowned in them, he can watch, to avoid the spiritual
dangers. This then is the thing which Saint Peter does exhort unto, that we
cast out cares and vain pleasures out of our mind, that they make it not
drunken, and cast it into a sleep, and so into extreme peril, but that it
may continue sober and fit to watch against all spiritual dangers. Our Savior
Christ does teach that the heavenly seed is choked with cares and pleasures of
this life, Luke 8 verse 14. And if any shall now demand, Does S. Peter exhort
here only unto that sobriety of the mind? or is it his purpose to exhort unto
sobriety in drinking also, together with that other? I answer that he
requires both: in as much as a man cannot have a sober and watchfall mind
which does follow the drunkenness of the body. For such as be given to
gluttony and drunkenness, or to take pleasure in pampering the flesh, their
mind is drowned in all lusts and carnal pleasures, and then cares do also
enter, how they may provide for the filling of those insatiable lusts: and so
their mind is also drunken and in a dead sleep, so that they cannot watch for
to eschew any spiritual danger. This is the extreme misery of such as do
flow in vain delights, that they be drunken and asleep, the devil may put
into them almost what he list. And therefore our Savior Christ warning his
disciples to watch for his coming to judgment, wills them first to beware
least at any time their hearts should be oppressed with surfeiting and
drunkenness, and with the cares of this life, and so that day should come
suddenly upon them, Luke 21. verse. 34.36. Where we see plainly that our
Savior joins both the bodily drunkenness, and the drunkenness of the mind
together, as making men utterly unfit to watch. Then beloved, let us give good
heed, and follow this wholesome counsel which the holy Ghost does here give
unto us by this Apostle. If we watch not, we are utterly undone, we are utterly
cast away, as it shall appear by the next words. We cannot watch unless we
keep our minds from the drunkenness of cares and carnal pleasures, and our
bodies from excess of wine and strong drink, and continue them sober. And thus
much touching the first part.

Now to the second: For your adversary the dinell, etc. If we be not
senseless, and void of all care, yea even as stones almost or blocks, if we
be not like mad men, this may move us unto all sobriety and watchsulnesse of
mind, here is so fearful and so horrible a danger set before us, if we do not
watch, namely, that our cruel enemy the devil seeks about continually,
and lies in wait greedily to devour our souls, yea even to swallow us up
unto eternal damnation in hell. Is it a light matter (beloved) to be devoured
of the devil? Is it nothing to go to hell? we are sure to fall into his
hands, we are sure to be devoured and swallowed up into the wosull gulf of
hell, if we do not learn to be sober and to watch, and so to avoid him: for
if we be drunken and so asleep in mind, he comes upon us, and there is no
help nor any way to escape him. Behold here, what the cares and pleasures of
the flesh do bring men unto, that is to say, they cannot watch, but their mind
is drowned and cast into a deep sleep, so that the devil comes upon them,
and takes them as a pray, swalloweth them up unto eternal captivity. But
there is great force in every word to express unto us this danger, and
therefore I will handle them particularly. Your adversary. Saint Peter
propounds unto us an adversary: and what do men look for at the hands of
a deadly adversary, but all the harm and mischief that he can work them,
and therefore each man has an eye to his adversary, to beware of him, that
he catch him not at any advantage. Now this adversary which is here
propounded does so burn in extreme hatred and malice against God, and against
all mankind, that it is given unto him as a proper name: for in the Hebrew
tongue he is called Satan, which is as much as to say, an adversary. For he is
the adversary, as I may say, of adversaries, or the chief of all other. There
is no way of reconciliation to be sought with him, there is no truce to be
made, nor yet any mitigation of his cruel fury to be looked for, but we may
be sure of all the mischief and harm that he can any way do unto us, make
full account of that. There is no pity or mercy with him, neither is he any
way to be trusted, for he is a liar, he is a deceiuer, he is a Devil. Your
adversary the devil. As he is called Satan in the Hebrew tongue, so is he in
the Greek tongue called Diabolos, which we call Devil, it is as much as to
say, one that does accuse, one that with cauillation does deprave and lay
crime. Look what is best done, that does displease him most: he is nothing but
falsehood and lies: as I said, here is no trusting here is no way or hope of
mitigation of his cruel rage. But it may be objected, seeing the multitudes
of nations and people upon the earth are so many, how can one Devil put all in
danger? for Saint Peter speaks as it were but of one Devil. While he is in
one country, he cannot be in another, and while he is dealing with one man,
another then goes free. For answer unto this, we are to understand, that S.
Peter speaks as of one devil, not because he is but one: for the holy
scriptures do teach that there be multitudes, and as it were Armies of Devils
which do compass us about seeking our utter destruction; we read in the
Gospel of a legion of Diuelles which did possess one man; as it is said, they
were many: But S. Peter here speaks as of one, because there is but one
kingdom of Satan, and one prince of darkness, that kingdom is not divided,
Satan is not divided against Satan, as our Savior teaches, Mat. 12. They do
all deal in one business, one does not envy another, one does not hinder or let
another, but further what they can: and so they join all together, as if they
were all but one Devil. The bond which does tie them together in this consent,
is that cruel malice and hatred wherewith they burn both against God and man.
So God may be dishonored and blasphemed it pleases them by whomsoever it be
done: so men may be brought to damnation, they care not which of them prevail
most. If one of them do as it were half prevail to cast down a man to
perdition, and another do finish it up, they contend not who has done most.
There needs no praise or commendation in that kingdom to prick any forward;
neither any threatening to the negligent: all are carried with a vehement heat to
do their uttermost. There is no man free then from the assaults and temptations
of Devils: they seek to devour every soul. Let no man imagine that he can
be drunken in mind, and so lie asleep; and yet be free from danger: He that
will escape must be sober, and watch, for a multitude of Diuelles compass us
about. It is said further, As a roaring Lion. We are very fast asleep if this
roaring cannot awake us, and cause us to be sober and watch, especially if we
consider why he is said to roar. It is written Psalm. 104. verse. 21. The Lions
roaring after their pray, do seek their meat at God. Whereby it does appear
that the Lions being very hungry and greedy, they roar after their pray: and
therefore to express how greedily Satan does hunt after the souls of men, how
hungry he is for to devour them, he is likened unto a roaring Lion which
seeks his pray. This comparison shows that he is very terrible, for a
Lion is a mighty beast, and being so hungry and greedy that he roareth for
the pray, it much increases the terror. The devil then is here set forth unto
us to be mighty, in as much as he is likened to a Lion, and very hungry and
greedy in devouring the souls of men, in that he is likened to a roaring Lion.
Who then that is wise will make himself dru^ken in mind with cares and
pleasures, and lie sleeping when such a terrible enemy seeks to devour him?
And now it may be demanded, what is the cause that the holy Ghost does set him
forth unto us to be so mighty and so terrible? the cause is manifest, we are
secure, we are negligent, we are ready to sleep, our minds are overwhelmed and
drowned in all lusts and carnal pleasures, as if there were no danger at all:
such is our extreme madness. And that is the cause why the Scripture in other
places also describes the devil to be so horrible. Saint Paul calls the
Devils Empires and powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and
spiritual wickedness in the high places. And shows that the Diuelles have
their fiery darts with which they seek to pearce through and slay the souls
of men. Ephe 6. ver. 12.16. What a dreadful monster is he set forth to be Reu.
12. He is not only likened to a dragon, but also a most huge great one, yea so
monstrous great, that he casts forth a flood of waters out of his mouth, and
his tail casts down the third part of the stars of heaven. He is not only a
most monstrous great Dragon, but also fiery red, burning with hatred, with
cruelty, and blood. Full of deep subtilties, for he has seven heads. Very
mighty, as having ten horns. One that has as a victorious Prince often
conquered the nations of the world, for he has seven crowns. What a terror is
set forth in all these, a hungry roaring Lion, mighty powers with fiery
darts, a most monstrous fierce Dragon, full of subtlety, cruelty, and power?
Is here any place to be drunken and to sleep? does it not stand us upon to be
sober and to watch? unless we account it a small matter to fall as a pray
into the paws of this roaring Lion, to have our souls pierced through and
wounded to death with his fiery darts and to be swallowed up into the belly
of this Dragon, and with him to be cast into the lake of fire, which is the
second death. Revel. 20. ver. 14. O beloved, let us not be so dull hearted,
when the Lord does warn us of such an adversary, as to make no reckoning, but
be as careless, as if we had no enemy at all that sought our woe. Men in
deed do naturally fear and tremble at any signs of the presence of devils;
if he show himself in any ugly form, they be terrified: and yet nevertheless
most carelessly make their own minds drunken with cares and carnal
pleasures, falling into a dead sleep, so that he utterly spoyleth them, and
wounds them to death, and they feel it not. This is even the course almost
of the whole world. O lamentable and wretched estate! who can bewail it
sufficiently? How many thousand thousands have drunk themselves stark
drunken with the delights of this world, and as merry as they be, are by
this roaring Lion devoured as a pray, and swallowed up by the Dragon? Drunken
persons, especially when they be fallen into a deep sleep, have no
perseverance of their miseries: Be they in debt, or condemned to death, they
feel it not, but can laugh: and so plays the drunken world. O how necessary
a thing is it then that we be sober and watch, to the end that we may escape
such dangers? But it is added further that this adversary goes about seeking
whom he may devour. This does much yet further increase the peril, and ought
so much the rather to move us unto a most careful sobriety and
watchfulness: this adversary does continually seek all occasions, and lies
in wait to epsy all advantages, how he may devour us as his pray. If a man
have a strong adversary, and one that hates him so deadly that if he could
catch him, he would take away his life: and the same his adversary be a far
off in another country, and does not lie in wait for him, he may be the more
secure, he may sleep quietly. But if he be always at hand, and do in all
places dog him, to epsy his fit opportunity to do him mischief, does it
not stand him upon, if be make any account of his own life, to keep himself
sober and watchful? shall be drink himself drunken and lie down to sleep?
The Devil our adversary goes about, he is ever at hand, he seeks all
occasions how he may devour us, is it now safe for us to sleep? Men when they
seek about and travel, do wax weary, and must have times to eat, and to
take their rest: it is not so with the Devil, he is very swift, he is never
weary, he needs no food, nor yet any sleep, he cease not day nor night
for to work our destruction. When we travel on the day he observes us,
when we lie upon our beds in the night he deals with us, there is no time
that we can be free from him. If he cannot prevail at one time, he wayteth
for another: if he cannot overcome a man in one sin, he tries him in
another: and most carefully he watches his fit occasions, and then he
tempts strongly.

To bring a man unto drunkenness, riot, and excess and to spend his time in
vain exercises, he has his instruments, even riotous persons, which are wholly
given that way, for to draw and to persuade. Woe be to that man which lights
into the familiarity of such sinners that will so allure and intise him. What a
wonderful force there is in company for to draw men unto evil, cannot
almost be expressed: and therefore when Satan has found such instruments for
to set upon a man, he has gotten great advantage. When a man is in place
where he may secretly commit some foul sin, as theft or adultery, and the
occasions offered, then Satan lays in hard. And so is it in other sins. What
should I enter into particulars, seeing he has a thousand ways, a thousand
occasions, yea ten thousand sleightes and crafty means for to wind in
himself. Alas what shall we do? Our Savior says, Watch and pray least ye
enter into temptation. Mat, 26. verse. 41. And as he said to Peter, Simon,
Simon, behold, Satan has desired to sift you as wheat, Luke 22.31. so let us
al be assured, that he has many ways to sift us, and to make trial what is
in us. We are taught to pray, Lead us not into temptation: and this place does
show how necessary a prayer it is: for if the Lord give scope to this enemy
and leave us to our selves, he will find a thousand means utterly to spoil
us: he will even devour us as his pray, and we shall not perceive it, for
therein lies the greatest danger, that he blinds the eyes of the mind, and
hardens the heart, when men feel not his working, nor imagine any such
thing. He that is sober and does watch, feels when he sets upon him, and
what harm he does unto him: where as on the other side, he may do what he
will unto those that are drunken and asleep, and they know it not. Thus much
touching the second part: now let us come to the third and last part.

Whom resist steadfast in the faith. If a man's adversary be too strong for him
by many degrees, what is he the better that he watches, if he can not avoid
but that he will find him and come upon him? will be not kill him for all his
watching? The like objection may here be made, namely, that the power of
Devils far exceeds all power of man: as we see they be described to be
mighty and terrible: and there is no way for a man to hide himself from them,
but they find him out, and come upon him: what is he then the better that he
does watch? Saint Peter does answer unto this: that although in our own
strength we are nothing to this mighty roaring. Lion yet there is a power in
which we shall resist him, put him to flight, and overcome him, and be armed
against al harms: and that is the power of faith: Whom resist (says he)
steadfast in the faith. Let it not seem strange unto any, that this power
should resist him, and keep us in safety, for it is the power of God. The
Devil is strong and mighty, but what is he unto God? God is above all his
power is infinite, there is no power that can stand against it. He that is
steadfast in the faith, he is armed and stands in the power of God: for faith
apprehends the power of God and armeth us with it. He that stands in the
faith, stands as it were in God, compassed about and covered with his power.
And as it is impossible that Satan should prevail against the power of God,
so is it impossible that he should overthrow that man which stands steadfast
in the faith: for so long as God cannot be overcome, faith cannot be overcome.
Is not here a most singular comfort and consolation unto us in this battle?
Let the Devil be never so mighty, never so subtle, fierce and raging, we
have a rock of defense, a safe tower to fly unto eue^ the invincible power of
almighty God, which we stand armed withal through faith. This is it which S.
Paul teaches where he speaks of the battle which we have with the devil:
My brethren (says he) be strong in the Lord, and in his mighty power. Put on
the whole armor of God, that you may stand against the assaults of the Devil.
For we wrestle not against blood and flesh, but against rulers, against powers,
etc. Therefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to
resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand. Ephesians. 6. verse.
10.11.12.13. Now it is faith that puts upon us the whole armor of God, and
makes us strong in his mighty power. It is faith, as he shows in the same
place, by which we shall quench all the fiery darts of the devil. Likewise S.
John sets forth this matter, saying, Whosoever is borne of God overcomes
the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.
Who is it that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the
son of God? 1. Ioh. 5. ver. 4.5.6. By the world he means the whole corruption
of sin, or whatsoever is against the commandementes of God, and so the Devil
the Prince of the world is included. He that overcomes the world, overcomes
the prince of the world: for all the power of Satan's kingdom is in darkness
and in sin. Then when Saint John says that faith is our victory, and that by
it we overcome the world, he teaches that it is says by which we are armed
with the power of God, in which we stand safe, and overcome the Devil.

Heerby it is manifest what a wonderful precious thing faith is. There is no
force that can overcome it, he that has obtained it cannot be poor, he cannot
be unhappy or wretched: all the devils in hell cannot preuail against him. They
that trust in the Lord are as mount the Sion, which cannot be moved, but
stands fast for ever. Psalm. 125. verse. 1 If it be then the most excellent
thing that is, to stand steadfast in the faith: then are we above all other
things to seek after it For wisdom teaches to seek most for the best
things. Gold, pearl, and precious stones do excel in price, and therefore
they be greatly sought after: and men do much rejoice when they find them.
They be more then dross being compared with faith, by which we put devils to
flight, and obtain eternal glory. Shall we not then seek for faith? Shall
we not make account that if we find it we have found all? for what can a man
have more then God? And if we miss of it we have lost all: seeing without it
nothing can defend us from the assaults of the Devil.

But when we are willed to resist the Devil steadfast in the faith, is it so
that we have faith in our own power, or when we will? Can we of our selves
be steadfast in faith? Or is it a matter so easy to obtain a strong faith?
Saint Peter has no such meaning. For goodly things are hard to be attained
unto: and faith is the most precious and excellent of all other, and most hard
to be come by. It is not in man's will or power to believe and to believe
steadfastly at his pleasure. But Saint Peter's meaning is, to move all men to
seek it where it is to be found, and by such means as be ordained for to come
unto it by. For there is no man almost but will acknowledge that a strong faith
is a most rich jewel: but when it comes to the matter they deprive
themselves for the most part, either deeming that they have it or can have it
in their own power resting in a vain shadow, not knowing at all the nature
of the true, lively, and powerful faith: or if they do acknowledge it to be
the gift of God; yet they never seek it by those means which he has ordained
to work it in men, and to nourish it up in them. When we are therefore willed
to resist the Devil steadfast in the faith, it is as much as to say, give all
diligence, and use all the ways and means that may be to increase and
strengthen your faith, that you may overcome the Devil. If you be diligent
that way, happy are you, and if you take not that course, then are you utterly
undone: for what way can you then escape the power and tyranny of the roaring
Lion?

But it will be said, S. Peter does not here show how men shall come to this
steadfast faith. No, for his whole doctrine tends to that point, in all this
Epistle, and therefore he needed not to put them in mind particularly: yet it
shall not be amiss for me to note somewhat.

He that will attain to the true, lively, and justifying faith, which armeth
a man with the power of God, must first of all know for certainty, that he has
not so much as any spark thereof of himself: we are all of us by nature shut
up under unbelief, and in miserable blindness: which while many do not know
they rest and content themselves in a certain dead image of faith, and are
utterly seduced, for that faith has no power. He that knows this indeed,
beholding the depth of the calamities which he is in, will look up to God who
is the giver of faith. He is desirous to know what the promises of God are
which he is to believe, and what the way is in which he must walk to
perform the duties of a Christian life: for the true faith works by charity
(as Paul says) and cannot be without good works. He searches the Scriptures
(as Christ wills, Ioh. 5.) he does with all diligence bend his ear to
hear the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ preached, feeling therein the power of
God to work faith. He does cry and call unto God day and night for to teach
him, to lighten him, to give him understanding, and to increase his faith: He
finds ye blessing of God in these means, and therefore applies them. But now
on the contrary part, he that rests in this, God gives faith, and if it be
his will. I shall have it, and so despises all means, not considering how God
gives faith, is utterly awrie, and out of the right way. From hence it is
that there be so many commendations of the word of God, and of the lively
power that it has to save our souls. From hence it is that we are often
called upon to give ear to the voice of God, to hearken to his counsels.

Thus shall we obtain the holy faith. And he that has faith, and feels the
power of God in him, if he will have it increase, is to consider the abundant
kindness of God who has bestowed so great a gift upon him, he is from the
bottom of his heart to give all praise and thanks and honor unto him for so
great kindness and mercy showed. Moreover, he is to take heed that will be
steadfast in the faith to resist the devil, that he be rich in good works, and
that he abstain from committing those vices which nature does lead unto. For
in the time of trial, in the hour of temptation, or when Satan does assault,
it will greatly shake the mind, if a man when he does look for the arguments
of a true faith, and finds that he has been fruitless: but if his
conscience do accuse him not only of a slacknesse in good works, but also of
foul sins committed, then will he cry out that all his former profession of
the faith was but in show or in hypocrisy.

This Apostle in the first chapter of his second Epistle teaches, that if we
join virtue with our faith, and with virtue knowledge, and with knowledge
temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godliness, and
with godliness brotherly kindness, and with brotherly kindness love: we shall
make our calling and election sure, we shall if we do these things (as he
says) never fall. 2. Pet. 1. verse. 5.6.10. We shall perceive assuredly if
these things be in us, that God has called us effectually, and that he has
chosen us. And therein does consist the stedfastnes of faith, even when we are
sure that God has chosen us in his son unto life eternal. If this assurance
of Gods love and favor toward us were not to be attained unto, how could he
say, Whom resist steadfast in the faith? Can there be any steadfast faith without
that? I beseech ye let us think well of these things: let us use all care and
diligence, yea all the holy means that God has appointed to increase our
faith, that being armed thereby, we may resist and overcome our enemy the
devil.

But here it may be demanded, whether the devil be to be resisted only by
faith, or some other things to be used? I answer, that Saint Peter does set
down the only way by which we are to resist the devil: we have nothing
whereby to withstand him but faith: and that is sufficient alone to withstand
him, whatsoever way he sekeeth to hurt us. I suppose that the reason heerof is
evident unto all men. The power of God alone is sufficient (every man will
confess) to shield us from the Devil, and no power indeed but the power of
God. Faith only armeth us with that power of God, and makes it as it were
ours. He that stands and lives (as the the Scripture speaks) by faith,
stands and lives not in himself, but in the power of God. If we think it
lawful to seek help to resist him, and to put him to flight any where but in
God, then may we use some other way to resist him besides faith. We are to
resist him by prayer, will some say. That is true, for prayer is a special
fruit of faith: the lively faith does bring forth true prayer. And if the
prayer be not of faith, it cannot help to deliver us from the tyranny of
Satan. Faith sends up prayer, yea with fasting strong prayer, which draws
down the power of God upon us, which shieldeth and defends us from the rage
of the fiende. All other means that have been devised to put devils to
flight, are vain and frivolous, yea mere illusions of Satan's own devising,
which wickedlie deface the power of God. For when men cannot resist by faith,
then do they fly unto those other means as more sure. Woeful is the state of
the world in this thing: that when men will not learn of God to resist the
devil: they learn at the devil himself. But that this thing may be more
evident, we are to see how many ways the devil seeks to devour us. I do
not mean that we should in particulars see those ways by which the Devil
deuoureth the souls of men: for who is able so to express them? surely not
any mortal man. For he has manifold sleightes, subtilties and crafts: yea
even ten thousand devises of all sorts to snare, and to entrap the souls
withal: He has also his forces and fiery darts of terror to wound
withal. It is no dealing in particulars: but to be armed strongly to resist
him howsoever he comes. My purpose therefore is but to touch certain
general heads which contain the rest. So that this cruel adversary, this
roaring Lion the Devil may catch the pray and devour it, he cares not which
way it be, for that is the end of all, if he may carry souls to hell. And
therefore according to the several states and conditions that men be in, he
frames himself to set upon them.

There is no man (I suppose) which will make any doubt that the devil coueteth
to plunge al men as deep as he can into all evil: but according as men are apt
and incliued, he is feign to deal as he may, with some one way, with some
another. Such as be ignorant, and in darkness, with them he deals that he
may keep the pure, clear and heavenly light of the Gospel out of their
hearts, and so hold them still under the power and in the kingdom of
darkness. Touching these Saint Paul says, If our Gospel be hid, it is hid
to those that perish: in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds
even of the infidels, least the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ,
should shine unto them: which is the image of God. 2. Cor. 4. verse. 3.4. To
bring this to pass this enemy uses special means, by which he may diffame
the Gospel and the profession of it, as a doctrine not to be suffered,
breeding and drawing with it so many enils As namely, he sows errors,
heresies, and wicked opinions. He is the father of al such things. He raises
up the heretics and Schismatickes, and then suggesteth to the hearts of men,
which be his chief servants, that the Gospel has bred them, and they
proclaim it with open mouth. Behold and see (say they) what a doctrine is
this, yea this new learning, that has brought forth so many foul heresies
and divisions. The devil (say they) the devil goes with it. How can it be of
God? how can it be good doctrine which brings forth such fruit?

Satan did practice this while the holy Apostles were alive upon the earth: as
we read how the false Apostles did seek almost every where to pull down that
which S Paul had built. S. John in the Revelation mentions the
Nicholaitanes, and a woman which said she was a Prophetess, that taught and
seduced the servants of the Lord, that they might commit fornication, and eat
of things offered unto Idols. And the same Apostle says that in his time there
were many Antichrists (for so he calls the heretics which then were) 1. Ioh.
2. S. Paul said to the Elders of Ephesus. I know this that after my departure
there shall enter in among you grievous Wolves, not sparing the flock, and
there shall rise up of your selves that shall speak perverse things to draw
Disciples after them. Act. 20. When all the Apostles were taken out of this
life, then was this prophecy fully accomplished, for then did the devil send
forth even routs of wicked heretics which did seduce many, and greatly
trouble all Churches. Then had he those which cried out: Behold what a
Gospel is this which has brought forth so foul and monstrous opinions? Thus
cunning lie did Satan work to keep many still in their former blindness. And
in like manner in these days, when the light of the gospel again brake
forth, he raised up horrible heresies and sects, and then sets his
servants a work to cry out: See what fruits this new Gospel brings forth?
This has made many so much offended at it, that they will not hear it: and so
the Devil holds them still in their former blindness, and deuoureth them as
a pray. Also he raises up lies and slanders to diffame both the doctrine
and all that profess it. This has been his ancient practice: Christ was said
to have a devil, to be a raiser of sedition, and an enemy to Caesar. His
Apostles were deemed to be raisers of faction and disturbers of the common
peace, enemies to the state of princes, and the Christians ever were accused to
be men which secretly among themselves did commit most foul and abominable
sins. True it is, that in all times he had many which were hypocrites that
professed the truth for a time and then falling into notorious offenses, all
the professors were said to be such. Thus has he in all times held many in
darkness, by making them out of love with the doctrine of salvation. And as
when Christ was risen from the dead, Satan did raise and spread a lie, namely
that while the watchmen were asleep, the disciples of Christ did steal him
away, and then said he was risen, and this lie was believed (though it were
most absurd and had no show of liklihood) so look what lies and slanders he
raises up now, many do believe them. For as S. Paul says 2 Thessalonians. 2.
Because men receive not the love of the truth, God sends them strong delusion
to believe lies. Now for a man to resist the devil in these practices, that
he be not seduced and held in blindness, it is necessary to have knowledge of
the truth and a lively says. For if he come once to that, he shall find that
the Gospel is the pure and heavenly light, even the power of God to salvation
as S. Paul says, to every one that believes. Romans 1. And that these sects
and heresies and troubles that follow it, are raised up by the devil himself,
even of purpose to diffame the truth, that so men may abhor to hear it
preached. Such as have received the knowledge of the truth and are lightened,
in them he seeks how he may quench the light, or take the power of it out of
their hearts, and so devour them as his pray.

He has diverse ways and means to effect this. To such as be the weaker in
knowledge, even as babes in understanding of the heavenly mysteries, he lays
stumbling blocks and offenses, that he may cause them to stumble and fall, or
to turn aside out of the way into which they have entered. He raises up
terrors, troubles, and perilles to abash them. He tempts and leads into
despair, shooting his fiery darts. To avoid these perils, there is no way,
but that as S. Paul prays for the faithful at Colossa, that we be filled
with the knowledge of the will of God in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding: that we may walk worthy of the Lord in all pleasing being
fruitful in all good works, and increasing in the knowledge of God:
strengthened in all might through his glorious power, unto all patience and
long suffering with ioyfulnesse, Coloss. 1. verse. 9.10.11. Some others that
have received more knowledge he seeks to cast down through pride and
presumption, he tempts them to be puffed up, and to swell, and so leads
them into sects, errors, and heresies, as his fit occasion serves, one part
into one, another into another.

Here is need of sound knowledge of heavenly things, and of that sincere
faith which purges the heart, and emptieth it of pride and human
presumption, leading men to rest only upon God with fear and trembling, even
with true humility. Also as he perceives men's inclination, he tempts and
leads them into grievous and abominable sins, and such as God is highly
displeased withal, some into one, and some into another, and so casts them
down. And in this he is wonderful subtle, and can find what sin a man
may most easily be brought into. If he be inclined to vain mirth and
lesting, he seeks to fit him with companions for that: that when he has
received the touch of heavenly motions, that vain mirth may put it out. If
he be inclined to unclean lusts of fornication, he will find the means (if
it be possible) to set as it were the bait before him, where he may be
intised. And so is it in all other vices: so that men had need watch and pray
least they enter into temptation. They need to be armed with a steadfast faith
to renste, that by their faith, all the fiery darts of this horrible enemy
may be quenched. His subtilties to keep men in blindness, his lies and
slanders to drive men from the Gospel, his assaults to lead into despair,
his stumbling blocks and terrors to turn men out of the way, his temptation
to lead into heresies and sects, or into any foul sin, or whatsoever
darts he shoots, there is no way to resist him, and to be kept safe, but by
a true, a lively, and a steadfast faith. Therefore (beloved) seeing this enemy
is so vigilant, and does so cruelly seek our destruction night and day, even
to swallow us up into the gulf of hell: and seeing he has so many sleightes,
so many trappes, so many baytes and allurementtes, so many fiery darts to
wound unto death: and seeing we are so ready to be seduced, having no power
of our selves; let us seek to be strongly armed with the power of God, that
so we may get the victory. There is no way for us to be armed with the power
of God, but by faith; so that the end of all is this, that men labor for the
increase and strengthening of their faith: use all good means and that
continually for the furtherance of the same. If upon such a danger we will not
be admonished by this wholesome admonition of the Apostle, we are more then
foolish or mad.

It may be some man will say that the devil is to be resisted only by faith
when he comes to hurt the soul: but is it not another case when he comes
to hurt the body, the cattle, or the goods of a man? Is he then also to be
resisted only by faith? Or is it all one when he comes to do those things
of himself, and when he is sent to do them by witches and sorcerers? Is there
now no means to resist him but by faith? To answer to this question, first it
is to be granted that the devils do indeed delight to torment and to hurt
man any way. And withal we see it plainly taught in the scriptures that he
has had powwer and leave sometimes granted unto him so for to hurt: As it was
granted unto him to destroy Jobs goods, some by fire, and some taken away by
robbers: to kill his children, and then to plague him in his body with most
grievous sores. We read of many in the Gospel whose bodies were possessed
with diuelles, and whom he did torment in very grievous manner.

And we must know withal that when he does hurt in the body or in the goods,
his chief drift and practice is thereby to destroy both body and soul, and so
he may make it a mean to win the soul, he will cease for to hurt the body,
seeming as if he were expelled. We read in the Gospel of two possessed with
devils, and Jesus casting forth the Devils, they besought him to give them
leave to enter into an heard of swine, he gave them leave, they entered, and
carried the whole learde of swine headlong from a steep place into the sea, and
drowned them, Math. 8. What was the purpose of those Diuelles, what was their
desire? Was it no more then for to destroy the poor dumb beasts? Yes verily
they had a further reach, and a deeper practice. This it was, they sought to
bring Christ into hatred with the men of that region among whom he was now
come: and why? but even that they might not hear him bringing the word of
life. They knew that those men were worldly minded, and that the loss of
their hogs would grieve them sore, and that they had rather be without
Christ, then that he should bring them such loss. And so it came to pass,
for the men of that city came forth and entreated him to depart out of their
coasts. Here was a crafty conueyance, and so Satan, whenever he obtayneth
power to hurt the body of man, his cattle or goods, it is not without some
great subtlety of a further and a greater mischief which he seeks to work.
Then further we may be sure that it is all one whether he come of himself, or
be sent by a witch. For I take it, none will be so simple as to imagine that if
he have power to hurt, that he will lie still and not hurt unless he be sent
by some man or woman. And if he have not leave granted him from God, no mortal
creature can give him power to touch the body or cattle of a man. Howsoever he
comes, we must know it is the Lord GOD of heaven that has sent him, even
as he gave him leave to deal with Job.

Then it must needs follow, that there is no power for to resist him withal,
but the power of God: and there is no way to be armed with that power, but
only by faith. If there be no way to withstand Satan but by the power of God
(as it is most wicked to deny) and through faith only man is armed with that
power, what other way or means can there be to resist him? There was a child
possessed with a Devil: the father brought him to the Disciples of Christ,
that they might cast him out; but they could not: Jesus cast him out. Then the
Disciples did ask him why they could not cast him out? He said unto them,
because of your unbelief. This kind (says he) goes not out but by prayer and
fasting, Math. 17. Where we see that the devil torme^ting the body, is to be
cast out by faith, yea by a strong faith, which is to be assisted with fasting
and prayer. But what if the devil (say some) afflicting the body, or
destroying the goods cannot be removed by faith or withstood, shall not men
then seek to remove him, or to withstand him some other ways? As we are
taught by experience, that the devil possessing the body of some man, woman
or child, and tormenting the same, prayer has been used, and that very often,
and yet no remedy has been found, but by other means he has been expelled.
Yea, some have been of that mind that God having given Satan power to touch
their bodies, their children, or their goods, they would seek no further but
to God, saying, that as he had given him power, so when it should please him
he would restrain him, and thereupon they would rest: but in the end they
have been glad to use other means. God has appointed means, and they tempt
God that refuse them. If a man be fallen into a ditch, and lie still praying,
God help me, Lord help me, and does not stir to clime out, he may he long
enough. If there be means by which the devil is driven out, why should not
men use them, seeing we may suppose that God has appointed those means? To
answer unto these things, we may first consider, that the Lord God for the
trial of their faith and patience, does give leave to Satan to afflict his
children. This is for their good. What should I use any proof for this, but
the exemple of Job? He was thoroughly tried. Now seeing it was the will of God
that he should so be tried, both for his own good, and for the instruction of
many others, though his faith were a right strong faith, yet in this thing it
did not repel Satan, but he had power given him to touch his goods, children
and body. And so we may hold it undoubtedly, that if God will give power or
leave unto Satan to touch the body, the children, or the goods of any
faithful man, for such a purpose as this was in Job, faith does not remove
him from so afflicting: but faith in those so for a time afflicted does resist
him, so that he does not nor cannot prevail against the soul. That is enough
for us. Such a man is to submit himself to the chastisement of God for his
trial. If Satan cannot be removed from hurting him in those outward things
which are of less value, let him hold fast that he resist him by faith, so
that he win not his soul and he is well: the Lord God will in his good time
deliver him from that other calamity. Let him know it is for his good that he
is so chastised.

The woman of Canaan, Math. 15. was a woman of a wonderful faith, for Christ
says, I have not found so great faith in Israel, and yet the Devil did
torment her daughter. She did not seek any other means, but sought out
Christ, and obtained of him to have the Devil cast out, which did so
grievously torment her child. This was for her trial, and she did for the time
endure it resisting the devil so mightily by faith that he could not prevail
against her soul.

Moreover, the devil has power given unto him to afflict some, and to plague
them in their bodies or in their goods, because of their sins. They have
despised the laws of God, they be careless to know the way of salvation.
When this scourge is upon them, they are to weigh and to consider how
grieuouslie they have offended, and how much they have provoked the Lord to
wrath, who has therefore given leave to this wicked enemy so to plague them.
They should now seek unto the Lord and entreat him to have mercy upon
them. They should lament and bewail their sins, and turn from their wicked
ways unto the way of righteousness: and then should this their calamity be a
mean to bring the^ nearer to God, to the salvation of their souls. They are
to entreat the Lord upon their repentance to remove the plague from them. And
if it be not removed, they are still more and more to be humbled, they ought
to fast and pray, yea they are to use all good means to come to the true
knowledge of God, and to a sound faith, that they may escape from being
devoured by this enemy unto eternal damnation. If the Lord do not deliver
them by and by, but that they be tormented in their own bodies, or in their
children or goods, let them know it is because they do not so thoroughly
repent, nor so thoroughly seek the Lord as they ought to do. Let them
therefore yet humble themselves further, and seek more earnestly to know the
way of God, and to be armed with true and lively faith.

There was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was
bowed together and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up her self:
Jesus healed her, and said, that Satan had bound her eighteen years. Luke 13.
ver. 11.13.15. If the Lord shall give Satan power so long to afflict, let us
not fall from God: let us not seek to resist him any way but by faith. Ye say
it is known by experience, that where the devil has tormented some, prayer
and all holy means have been used, and yet no help at all, until other
means have been sought. Then belike there be means which are stronger against
the devil then faith and prayer. And there is some power mightier against him
the^ the power of god: for those means which some men fly unto, when as they
cannot prevail by faith, are such as they which are afflicted have learned
either by a prescriptio^ from the devil himself, saying, let such or such a
thing be don, and there shall be remedy; or else they have them prescribed by
some wise man, or wise woman, who have them from the devil. These be very
paltrie things (as there be a number, I need not to repeat them, they be too
well known, and too much practiced) and yet they be more sought unto then
faith is, which armeth us with the power of God. What a dishonor is this to the
high Majesty of the Almighty? What an infidelity is it? Shall men run to the
devil for help? Is he fitter to teach them or of more power then God?

But ye say, we see the thing is wrought by those means which could not
otherwise be obtained, Satan is expelled, and ease has followed. Has Satan
expelled Satan? or has he taught how he might be expelled indeed? Is the
devil become so simple? Will he hinder his own kingdom? Are men so foolish as
to believe that he is by such things in very deed driven out? A man tormented
sore in his body, he fears that it is some witch that has done it. He is
advised by his neighbors to send unto some cunning man. Word is sent back,
that indeed he has bad neighbors: let him do such or such a thing, and he
shall have ease. Well, he does it and has ease. What shall we think that the
devil is driven out? A woeful driving out. He does cease from tormenting the
body for a time, that he may enter deeper into the soul. He wins by this
driving out. The like may be said where he has power given unto him to destroy
men's cattle. They be taught many things how to resist him: among other to
offer some burnt offering unto him, they must burn somewhat alive. Well he
comes no more: there is a power above faith that has put him to flight. And
where as you say that some have been of the mind that they would not seek any
way or means, but only to God, and would rest until he should restrain the
devil: but have been glad in the end to use other means. It is a lamentable
hearing, that the faith of any should so far fail: that in steed of approaching
nearer to God by strong repentance, they have turned to the counsel of the
devil. If they could not find help by prayer, they might be assured that the
Lord would yet afflict them further, and that with all humblenes they ought to
submit themselves under his mighty hand: yea they ought to have considered the
weakness of their faith, and the grieuousnes of their sins, and so have
sought by all means possible to get a steadfast faith, and unfeigned repentance.
This their affliction by Satan should have been a warning unto them, to make
the^ cleave more firmlie to God, and to look better to themselves, and see how
it has driven them to run back from God to the devil. But you say God has
appointed means, and he that refuses the means tempts God. As for
example, shall a man cry, Lord help, and not stir? Indeed if you could prove
that God had appointed such means to drive away devils where faith cannot,
your saying were true. But where can you prove in all the whole word of God
that any such means are appointed to put devils to flight? If those means be
not in the holy Scriptures, they be not ordained of God, they be not of faith,
it is not the power of God that expels Satan, but it is his own slight
that seems to be repelled and vanquished, when he is not; they be means of
his own devising, which he has taught by those that have familiarity with him.

The holy Scriptures do condemn it as a most wicked thing, that men should
have any dealing with devils to be taught at their hands. We are to be taught
of God, Christ Jesus is our only Doctor: shall we then learn at the mouth of
Devils? A man is taken lame, he suspecteth that he is bewitched, he sends to
the cunning man: He demaun^deth whom they suspect, and then shows the image
of the party in a glass. When this is done he shows and prescribes what
the lame man shall do for to get remedy: how he shall cause the old witch
to come unto him, and how he shall use her. Here all is done by the direction
of the devil: are these means then appointed by God? Also there is one whom
Satan does as it were possess and does torment the body: there is seeking
unto god, but not like the Cananitish woman that came to Christ to have the
devil driven out of her daughter, who with the strength of her faith would not
be denied, Math. 15. but like to king Saul, who receiving no answer from God,
gate him by and by unto a Witch: for not finding help by faith and prayer, or
by those ways that God has appointed, they then begin to hearken to the
devil, and he tells them that if they shall do such a thing, such a devil
shall depart. Here be the means, which some do hold to be appointed by God.

But is not this a wonderful blindness that Satan can set up himself to be a
teacher, and men learning of him, shall think that they learn of God? Well
say some, we are glad to have ease, we find that the devil is expelled, we
may think that God does allow it. Shall a man be glad for to buy ease so dear?
May we call that ease, when the devil cease to vex the body for a time, to
the end that he may torment soul and body in hell for ever? If a man be sick
of a burning ague, and take that to cool the heat and to give ease for the
time, which will afterward cause it to be more burning, is that a good
remedy? Is that a good remedy, which for a little while does seem to
mitigate, but afterward does increase the disease? Even so the blind people do
imagine that Satan is expelled by those means, by which indeed he enters more
deep into them. For tell me but this, wherein does the kingdom of the Devil
consist? Is he not called the prince of this world, and the prince of
darkness? This his kingdom does consist in infidelity, in darkness and in
sin. He that is under the power of sin, so that sin has dominion over
him, he is under the power and working of Satan. Sin is his kingdom, there
is his throne, ye cannot separate them, he cannot be cast forth, and sin
still remain in force. If pride, envy, covetousness, hatred, malice,
self-love, fornication, or any other such sin do reign and rule in the
heart of man, there rules the devil: for these be the works of the devil.
Hereupon our Savior said to the Jews, Ye are of your father the devil: ye
do the works of your father. Ioh. 8. He that will then cast forth the
devil, he must cast out those works. For he that commits sin is of the
devil, as Saint John says in his first Epistle chap. 3. He that still
commits sin, and therefore is of the devil, is the devil expelled or
driven from him? I suppose that there is no man so void of reason, that he will
imagine, that the devil is driven away from that man in whose heart he has
his throne and power. A man is ignorant of the word and ways of God: with his
ignorance of necessity goes unbelief: with unbelief there go the
unfruitful works of darkness. There is much vanity of mind, there is much
profaneness, there be foul errors and abominable vices.

This man has some of his cattle destroyed by the devil: he would have the
devil expelled, he has not faith which armeth men with the power of God: he
has not the faith which overcomes the world, 1. Ioh. 5. or which purges the
heart. Act. 15. or which quenches all the fiery darts of the devil. Ephesians 6.
or (as Saint Peter says here) resists him: And seeks some other helps to
resist him, yea, to be delivered from him, and never does consider that he is
first to have him removed out of his heart. He should consider that the devil
(as Saint Paul says) works in the children of disobedience. Ephesians. 2. verse.
2. And therefore so long as he is disobedient to God, Satan cannot be cast
forth of his heart. If those things can resist Satan which men do learn and
practice here in the world, as there be a thousand devises, by which he
persuades the world that he is resisted: then it skilleth not whether a man
be godly or ungodly, faithful or unfaithful, touching the resisting and
putting diuelles to flight. If when a man's cattle are plagued and destroyed by
the devil, it will deliver the rest if he burn one alive: this way may the
Jew, or the Turk, or the heathen cast him out as well as the Christian. And so
it may be said in all other their wicked means. They tend wholly therefore to
this end, that men may be held in infidelity, in blindness, and hardness of
heart, even void of repentance for their sins, that is the craftiness of
Satan. For if devils can be put to flight and overcome by such means, men
will never seek to be armed with faith, they never care for true repentance:
they be persuaded that the devil has nothing to do with them. And therein
lies one of the greatest subtilties of Satan that he may devour men when they
dream of no peril, and therefore seek not to God, to be armed with his
mighty power through faith. For when men do know that there is no way to
escape but by faith (as Saint Peter says here, whom resist steadfast in the
faith) if they be not mad, they will have a care to attain to that true faith.

In the Popery there were many things devised to drive away devils. Men were
persuaded that the sign of the Cross did put him to flight. They had their
coniured holiwater to sprinkle upon the men, and in their houses, and thither
the Devil might not come. Likewise if a man had a piece of holy bread in his
purse, or any where about him, he was armed, he might go safe in the darkest
night that was. There were hallowed candles, and within the light of them the
wicked Prince of darkness could not approach. But there was yet a stronger
thing and a more terrible unto the Devils, then all the rest, even to hunt them
out of the country.

The Lord sends lightening and thunder, and mighty winds: he does thereby
declare his majesty. When these tempests do arise, the devil would gladly
make men believe that he has raised them: he would be as a God of power: and
therefore he coueteth to show himself in those tempests, and so does come with
terror. To meet with this mischief and to repel him, the Papists had their
hallowed belles, their Saints belles, and those they did ring out when any
terrible tempest did approach, trusting that the sound of them would repel him,
and put him to flight. O how the Devil was skared with these things! S. Peter
forgate himself that he did not tell of these, and not speak of resisting him
by nothing but by faith. Such ready helps for to defend men, and so easy,
and not one of the Apostles would tell of them: but speak only of faith to be
our victory. Well (beloved) know for certainty that all these are but
sleights of the Devil: which were used in the popery, and which many at this
day do use when they suppose that they are bewitched. Leave all such ungodly
ways which the Devil teaches, and hearken to the holy Ghost, which wills
you to resist the Devil steadfast in the faith. Let all your study, and
industry, and care be, to be armed with a strong and lively faith. That
shall cover you, and compass you about with the almighty power of God. Ye
shall be as the mount Sion (says the Prophet in the Psalm) that cannot be
removed. All the infernal powers (or as Christ says, the gates of hell) shall
not prevail against it. If you have that faith, the roaring Lion shall not
devour you: but all his fiery darts shall be quenched. He will do what he
can to hold you in blindness, to lead you into sin, and into heresies, he
will tempt you to despair, but your faith shall prevail. He will seek to hurt
your bodies and goods, resist him by faith. Blessed be our Lord that has given
us such a tower of refuge. Amen.

FINIS.
THE SECOND SERmon upon 1. Peter, chap. 5. verse. 8. and 9.
Whom resist steadfast in the faith. We have heard the exhortation or warning
which Saint Peter gives unto all men to be sober and watch. We have also in
the second place seen the cause why it behooves us to be watchful. There is
an adversary that does seek to devour us both souls and bodies unto eternal
destruction. Your adversary the devil (says he) like a roaring Lion walks
about, seeking whom he may devour. In the third place we have been taught how
to withstand him and to get the victory over him. Whom resist steadfast in the
faith. Where it has been showed that faith armeth a man with the power of
God. The power of God is invincible and cannot be brought under, but gets
the victory over all the terrible might of Devils: so that it is not possible
that he should be overcome which has faith. It conquereth all the infernal
powers, and triumphs at all times most gloriously over them. Whereby it is
manifest what a wonderful rich and precious jewel faith is. It preserves us
safe from diuelles, and therefore is to be coueted and sought for above all
treasures. It is to be sought for at the hands of God, he is the giver of it,
and it is not a thing which is in man's own power. Moreover, seeing God does
give it, and nourish it by means, he that will be steadfast in the faith, must
use those means that be ordained. Also it has been declared, that faith is
the only thing by which we are to resist the Devil: in as much as faith
alone armeth us with the glorious power of God. Satan has many ways whereby
he seeks to devour and to swallow up into hell the souls and bodies of men:
as to hold some in blindness and ignorance, to lead others into sects,
errors and heresies, to draw men into vices and abominable sins, to plague
the bodies and the cattle of men? but which way soever he comes, faith does
quench all his fiery darts arming the soul of man, covering and compassing it
round about with the mighty power of God. Al those vain, yea those most wicked
means by which men seek to repel Satan, are to be renounced as mere
illusions. Men are to be taught of God, and not to learn of diuelles: but
Diuelles have devised those means, and by such as have familiarity with them
have delivered the same to be put in practice. As there be such devises among
the Sorcerers which Satan has craftily conueighed in: so also in the Popery
they did not seek as Saint Peter wills to resist him by faith, but invented
other ways. Thus far we proceeded in handling this Scripture: And now it
remains as a principal question to be handeled, whether this faith, by which
the devil is to be resisted, can be overcome in any? that is, to speak more
plainly, whether any man that has the true and lively faith, by which the
devil is resisted, can utterly loose it, and fall from God finally? whether
his faith may utterly fail and be vanquished, and so having resisted Satan for
a time steadfast in the faith, yet in the end he may be overcome and devoured by
him?

Touching this question, the Papists do hold that a man may have the true and
lively faith, and so fall from it, as that it be utterly and wholly quenched in
him, yea finally. And so by their doctrine such as do stand in this faith
which Saint Peter requires, and with the same do resist the devil, may by the
devil have that same their sound and true faith overcome, and so perish
eternally. Others there be, who will seem to differ somewhat from the Popish
sort about this matter, and they do hold that the very reprobate (some of them
at the least) are partakers for a time of the true, lively, and justifying
faith, which is afterward wholly and finally extinguished in them. Moreover,
they do hold, that the same true and lively faith may be wholly extinguished in
the elect, but not finally, because it is impossible that the elect should
perish, and therein they differ indeed from the Papists, which make election
conditional. If this doctrine of theirs be true, then is there no man that
can be certain of his salvation. There is no man that is sure he shall stand
to the end, no man can resist steadfast in the faith. For he that to day does
get the victory over the devil by a true and lively faith, to morrow may
utterly loose his faith, and be overcome by the devil. If it be so, then has
not Saint Peter here taught how we shall have undoubted victory: if he will us
to resist by such a weapon as may be broken or destroyed, or plucked away from
us, we are then but in a very weak case.

It may be they will say, there is undoubted victory so long as a man does
resist steadfast in the faith: and that Saint Peter has no further intent. That
is the thing which we are to enquire of. And this shall be made manifest, that
whosoever has the true and lively faith, shall undoubtedly get the victory
over Satan: that it is impossible that his faith should be wholly extinguished,
it is impossible that he should perish.

This is it which we affirm, that whosoever does attain unto a steadfast faith
(which is the thing which Saint Peter here requires) that faith can never be
overcome: for if it be overcome, it is not steadfast. It is the purpose of
Saint Peter, not to teach that so long as a man is steadfast in the faith, so
long he shall resist the Devil, and get the victory, taking this, so long, as
if it were uncertain that he which is once steadfast, shall continue to the
end: but this is his full meaning, that so many as attain to be steadfast in
the faith, shall undoubtedly vanquish Satan, and never be vanquished by him.
Hitherto then tends his doctrine, even to show, that as we are compassed
about and beset with devils, who like most greedy devouring Lions do seek
continually for to swallowe us up: so if we seek so far as to be armed with a
steadfast faith, we attain to that estate out of which we can never be cast.
It is as much as if he should say, the Devil can never overcome a steadfast
faith: obtain that and you are sure to stand to the end.

Beloved, we are not then to labor only for faith, but if we will be sure
to overcome the devil, and to stand to the end, we must labor to obtain a
steadfast faith. But how can we be sure that this is the mind of the Apostle,
to warrant men, that they shall get the victory over the devil, even to the
end, if they attain unto a steadfast faith? I answer, that he agrees with
himself, teaching here the same thing which he exhorts unto in the first
chapter of his second Epistle: Here unto (says he) give all diligence, in your
faith minister virtue, in virtue knowledge, in knowledge temperance, in
temperance patience, in patience godliness, in godliness brotherly kindness,
in brother he kindness love. For if these things be among you, and abound,
they will make that you neither shall be idle nor unfruitful in the knowledging
of our lord Jesus Christ. For he that has not these things is blind, and
cannot see a far off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old
sins. Wherefore brethren give rather diligence to make your calling and
election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. For by this
means an entering shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting
king dome of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2. Pet. 1.5.6.7.8.9.10.11. In this place S.
Peter does most plainly affirm that they which have such a faith as goes
with those fruits, they come to an assurance that they be called of god, and
chosen unto life and glory: and he does assure and warrant them that they shall
never fail. He adds as a reason that they have an entrance into the kingdom
of Christ, which is everlasting. If the true lively faith may fail and be
wholly lost, what assurance can any man have that he is called of God and
chosen to life eternal? Or how could the holy Apostle say, If ye do these
things ye shall never fall? Do not they fall which loose the faith, or in
whom it is wholly quenched? Christ reigns in all those which have the lively
faith, and if his kingdom may be broken down again where it once takes
place, how can it be said in every respect to be eternal?

Now to join these two places together, that man has the steadfast faith
whereby he does resist the devil, which does those things which S. Peter
mentions, and thereby is sure he is called and chosen, and that he shall
never fall. He is firm and steadfast in the faith which comes unto this: and
such as have proceeded no further in the power of a fruitful faith, but that
they be still uncertain whether they shall stand to the end, how can they be
said to resist the devil steadfast in the faith? When S. Paul tells us that
the shield of faith does quench all the fiery darts of the Devil, it is to
give courage and comfort, that such as have once gotten that shield, shall
never be overcome: for if the faith be overcome, then it does not quench them
all. The like courage and comfort Saint Peter does here minister, by showing
that being steadfast in the faith Satan is resisted. Where a man is sure to get
the victory how valiantly he does fight, what assaults he will endure, and
with what comfort and consolation of mind. But if the battle be made
doubtful, that although he have so lively a faith which woorketh by charity,
yet he may loose it, he may be overcome, it daunteth and discourageth, it
takes away the comfort and consolation. And this is to overthrow that which
the Lord of special purpose has allotted to his children, namely, that in all
the trials, and afflictions, and temptations which they pass through, they may
have strong consolation. For it is written, Wherein God willing more
abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the stablenesse of his counsel
confirmed by an oath, that by two immutable things in which it was impossible
for God to ly, we might have strong consolation. Heb. 6. ver. 17.18. If God
has confirmed his promise by an oath, that all they which believe in his son
shall have eternal life, why is it, or to what end is it, but that we should
come to the assurance of salvation, without which assurance there can be no
strong consolation? If men be condemned for high treason, and then some hope
of pardon follows, it somewhat comfort that they may suppose it may be
they shall escape the torments of death, and not be executed; but so long as
there is doubt they have no strong consolation: but when they know assuredly,
and have it confirmed unto them that they are set free by pardon, then is their
consolation strong indeed. We are all of us for high treason against God
condemned to hell to endure eternal torments: A covenant and promise is made,
that so many as do believe in the son of God shall have free pardon, and so
not only escape from those endless miseries, but also be lifted up into
eternal glory. So many as do wisely and sensibly consider this woeful and
miserable estate, in which all are in by nature, cannot but be touched with
great horror and fear. For is it a light matter to be cast with the devil and
his Angels into eternal fire? Is he not more then mad which can be merry so
long as he is subject unto so horrible damnation? Well, there is hope of pardon,
that so he shall escape, in as much as God has not only given his son to
be a redeemer, but has promised and bound that his promise with an oath,
that every one which believes shall be saved. He feels that he has a
faith, and it does comfort him: but until he feel that the same his faith is
the true and lively faith which gets the victory over Satan, and which can
never be vanquished, he cannot have strong consolation. Eternal woe with the
diuelles in hell is a most grievous thing, and impossible it is that any man
should have strong consolation, unless he be sure that he shall be delivered
from it: Whereupon it follows, that feeing the blessed Lord God has ordained
that his children shall here in the midst of the battle against Satan have
strong consolation, that he does also give unto them assurance of faith, yea
such a faith as they do know can never be overcome. Take away the one and
take away the other. Whereby we see that they which do hold that the true and
lively faith may be wholly lost, overthrow the stablenesse of Gods covenant. If
they will object that many have great gladness and consolation which have not
any true says, I answer, that the blind world is drowned in a carnal
consolation, they do not soundly believe, nor sensibly consider what estate
they be in. They be but as drunken men, who through exceeding drunkenness
passing toward horrible torments, do not perceive it nor regard it, but are
merry and laugh and sport themselves: For they which are so merry and do sport
themselves so much in sin and in carnal pleasures, if they did know or
advisedly consider whither they be going and what remains for the^, it would
dampe all their mirth. It is not the strong consolation which the holy Ghost
speaks of, that they have. Theirs is but a drunken madness. Such only as by
a lively faith do feel the power of Christ in them mortifying and slaying
sin, and quickening them unto righteousness and true holiness even to walk
in the light, and to bring forth the fruits and virtues of the spirit, have
the strong consolation. They be assured that they be delivered from hell, and
made heirs of eternal glory: in as much as they know that God does sanctify
none but those whom he does glorify. But they do allege sundry testimonies
of the holy Scriptures, by which they undertake to prove that the very
reprobate have the true, lively and justifying faith, which they do utterly
loose: and likewise, that the elect do so fall, that the same true and lively
faith for a time is utterly quenched in them. if it be so, then all assurance
is gone, and with it there vanishes away all strong consolation. For if the
true faith be in the reprobate, then cannot any man thus argue, I have the
true, lively and sanctifying faith, therefore I am chosen of God and sure to
be saved. Neither can he say thus, If I fall, I shall rise again: for what is
it that can assure him that he shall rise again, if some that have the same
true faith which he has, do fall and never rise again? Let us therefore
consider what their proofs be, or testimonies upon which they stand, to
prove that the true faith may be utterly lost. In the old Testament it is
thus written, But when the righteous does turn away from his righteousness,
and commit iniquity, and does according to all the abominations which the
wicked does, should he live? all his righteous deeds which he has done shall
not be remembered: for his transgression in which he transgresses, and for his
sin in which he sins, for these he shall die. Ezech. 18.24. The Lord
Jesus says, that there be some which do believe for a time, and in time of
temptation go away. Luke 8.1^. Thou stand (says S. Paul) by faith: be not
high minded, but fear, Romans 11. ver. 20. Also the same Apostle speaks of
some that made shipwreck of the faith 1. Tim. 1. verse. 19. He that thinks
he stands, let him take heed least he fall. 1. Cor. 10. ver. 12. Christ
says to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus. Thou have left thy first love,
Reave. 2. ver. 4. Take heed least any man fall away from the grace of God,
Heb. 12. verse. 15. And S. Peter does speak of such as are like the dog that
returns to his vomit. 2. Pet. 2. There be other places of scripture which
they do also allege to prove that men that have the true and lively faith,
may wholly loose it, I will not stand to answer every one particularly, but in
general, and thus, that whatsoever the word of God speaks of falling from
grace, of turning from the way of righteousness, or loosing the faith, it is not
to be understood of the grace of sanctification or of the true lively
justifying faith, but of that other faith which the holy scriptures do speak
of, which the wicked may have, and of those graces which they also are after a
sort made partakers of. For this is sufficient for me to show, that whosoever
is once partaker of the lively faith, he can never loose that faith, he can
never perish: for that being proved it must needs be confesled that all the
scriptures which they allege are to be understood not of that lively faith,
or of those that be sanctified. I am (says Christ) the true vine, and my
father is an husbandman. Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes
away, and every branch in me that bears fruit he purges that it may bear
more fruit. Ioh. 15. verse. 1.2. Christ is the vine, and they which profess his
name be the branches. These branches be of two sorts: the one sort bears no
fruit, the other sort bears fruit. Now let it be demanded what are they
which bear fruit? It must needs be answered, they be such as have the true and
lively faith, they be ingrafted into Christ and do receive as it were the sap
or juice of life from him. Their faith is that, which Saint Paul says,
works by charity, and therefore every one that has that faith bears fruit.
Then who be those branches that bear not fruit? They be Christians in name
and in profession; otherwise he would not say, Every branch in me that bears
not fruit. They be after a sort grafted also into Christ in as much as they
have been baptized, and do profess to believe in him: but their faith is but
a dead faith; otherwise it could not be said, that they bear no fruit. By
this we see it is evident that there is a difference of faith, there is a
fruitless or a dead faith, and there is a faith which is lively, and cannot
but work. Then see how we are to argue out of this place. Every branch that
bears fruit, that is, every one that has the true and lively faith, shall be
purged, that it may bear more fruit: therefore not any one of the reprobate
have the lively faith. This consequence is clear, if we consider that he
says, Every branch that bears fruit he purges, not to take it afterward
away, but that it may bear more fruit. For will they be so bold as to say thus,
Some branches that bear fruit shall be taken out of the vine, as well as the
branches that bear no fruit? Or thus, Some branches that bear fruit shall
be purged that they may bear more fruit: but yet in the end they shall also
be taken out of the vine, were not that a strange speech? What difference, or
what a vain difference were that which Christ makes of the branches, touching
perseverance in the vine if the fruitful branches, or any of them could be
separated from it, as well as the unfruitful? how do they make Christ to
speak? It may be they will say, that the holy scripture speaks sometimes
vnsuersally, when as yet exceptions in particulars are for to be admitted: and
so his saying does stand true although some branches that have born fruit, be
taken out of the vine and do perish. I answer, that this cavil is of no force
here because ourSauiour does so speak universally, that he also speaks
singularly. He says not all the branches that in me bear fruit, but every
branch in me that bears fruit, he purges that it may bear more fruit. So
that we may conclude, that there are none of the reprobate that have the true
and lively faith: for if they had, they should bring forth fruit and so remain
for ever in the vine. Again, whosoever knows that he brings forth
fruit, he may be assured that he shall continue in the vine for ever, he
shall never perish. Also Christ says, I am the bread of life, he that
comes to me shall not hunger in any wise, and he that believes in me shall
never thirst. This is the will of him that sent me, that every one that sees
the son and believes in him may have everlasting life: and I will raise him
up at the last day. I am that bread of life, your fathers did eat Manna in the
wilderness and are dead. This is that bread that came down from heaven, that
if any man eat thereof, he should not die. I am the living bread which came
down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever. He
that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life: This is that
bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers did eat Manna, and are
dead: he that eats of this bread shall live for ever. Ioh. 6. ver.
35.40.48.49 50.51.54.58. From these Scriptures we may draw most firm
conclusions, that not any one of the reprobate ever have or can have the true
and lively faith: but that whosoever believes he is assured of life eternal:
Christ teaches that he is the bread of life, and that whosoever eats of
that bread he shall live for ever. It is not possible that any man should eat
of that bread, and yet not live for ever. Every one that believes in him (I
speak of that lively faith which as the hand apprehends Christ, and by which
we receive him and his benefits) does eat his flesh, and drink his blood. He
that believes in me (says he) shall never thirst: for let any man show a
reason why some that believe in Christ do eat his flesh and drink his blood
and other some, having the same lively faith, do not. What will they say that
the reprobate and damned, so many of them as ever come to have the true and
lively faith (according as they imagine) do indeed eat the flesh of Christ and
drink his blood, and so for a time be made lively members of Christ, even
flesh of his flesh, and bones of his bones, as the Apostle speaks Ephesians. 5.
ver. 31? If they do not eat his flesh and drink his blood, then have they not
the faith: remove that effect, and the cause is removed. If they will not
abhor so wicked a speech, but affirm indeed that the reprobate do eat the
flesh of Christ, so many of them as have the lively faith: then let the^ see
how they overthrow also the whole force of the argument of Christ, by which he
proves that the Manna was not the bread of life; but that he himself is the
bread of life. Your fathers (says he) did eat Ma^na in the wilderness and are
dead. If any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever. How stands his
argument, consider of it I pray you. Your fathers did eat Manna in the
wilderness, and yet are dead in their sins: they are dead in the spiritual
and eternal death (for of that death he speaks, seeing they also which eat
the flesh of Christ do die the natural death) therefore Manna was not the
bread of life that comes down from heaven. For that which some did eat of,
and yet did die eternally, is not by any means the bread of life. And how
does he prove that he himself is the bread of life? I am the bread which
came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever.
Thus stands his reason. Whosoever eats the flesh of Christ, he shall live
for ever: therefore the flesh of Christ is the bread of life. If they shall now
say, some of the fathers in the wilderness did eat the Manna, and yet died in
their sins: it cannot be denied: and thereupon Christ does affirm that Manna
was not the bread of life that comes down from heaven: and then add their
own saying, which is this, some do eat the flesh of Christ, and yet do die
in their sins: what will then follow? if this reason do stand in force; Your
fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness and are dead: therefore Manna was not
the bread of life. Then shall not this also follow, Many do eat the flesh of
Christ, and yet are damned: therefore the flesh of Christ is not the bread of
life. Thus it is evident that such as do affirm that any of the reprobate have
the lively faith, do gainsay Christ, and overthrow the force of his argument.

To proceed, what can be more firm to prove that the reprobate cannot have
the true, lively and justifying faith, then that which Saint Paul has written?
Where this ground is first to be laid, that whosoever he is that has the
true justifying faith, he has the spirit of sanctification, the spirit of
adoption: for thus the Apostle conioyneth them: wherein also after that ye
believed, ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest
of our inheritance, unto the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the
praise of his glory: Ephesians. 1. ver. 13.14. Is there any so absurd as to hold
that a man is a lively member of Jesus Christ (as every one is that has the
lively justifying faith) and yet has not that holy spirit of promise, that
spirit of adoption, that scale, and that pledge? If they will say that the
faith which the reprobate do attain unto is without this spirit of adoption,
or without this seal or pledge: then do we hold with them, and then does it
follow, that the faith of the reprobate is not the true justifying and
sanctifying says which purges the heart, Act. 15. But if they shall say that
the reprobate are for a time partakers of the spirit of sanctification, even of
that spirit of adoption: then will there diverse right wicked consequences
follow, which are to be banished far from christian religion. For first
touching the spirit of adoption, see what the Apostle says; As many as are
led by the spirit of god, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received
the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of
Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father. That same spirit bears witness unto
our spirit that we are the sons of God. Romans 8.14, 15, 16. If any of the
reprobate be led by the spirit of God, or be at any time sanctified, then has
not S. Paul here said true, that as many as are led by the Spirit of God,
they are the sons of God. Some of the reprobate indeed do taste of the
heavenly power, but they are not led with the spirit of God: they be not
sanctified, they walk not after the spirit. Moreover, the spirit of adoption,
the sanctifying spirit which is in all that have the true, lively and justifying
faith, bears withes with and to the spirit of the believers, that they be the
children of God. This is the lively faith when a man believes that the Lord
God is his father, and that he is the son of God. And this faith is not
separated from the spirit of adoption, for it is upon his testimony that they
do believe, and by him they cry Abba, Father. Is not this spirit a true
spirit? and is not his witness most firm andtrue? If it be as those men say,
that the reprobate are partakers of the spirit of adoption, then is not his
testimony firm and true. For then that spirit of adoption teaches some man
to call God Father, and witnesses to his spirit that he is the son of God,
when as he is the child of the devil: for having that faith, and that
testimony of the spirit in him to day, to morrow he does by their saying,
utterly and sinally lose that faith and that spirit. What an opinion is this to
say that a man has the true faith, that is to say, believes by the testimony
of the holy Ghost, that God is his father, and yet he is indeed the child of
the devil? And moreover, does not the Apostle say, that after they believed
they were scaled with the holy spirit of promise? This is more then the bare
testimony of the spirit, if I may so speak, that he seals. Can this seal
be disanulled or broken, or made frustrate? Is this seal untrue? If it be
ever set upon the reprobate, it is deceivable. If their opinion be true: no
man can then say thus, God has sealed me with his spirit, therefore I do
belong to God: For a reprobate has that seal, and it fails him: then who
can say that it is a seal, which is true and infallible? Saint John showing
upon what testimonies faith in Christ is grounded: says, There be three that
bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Spirit, and these
three are one. And there be three that bear record in earth, the spirit, and
water and blood, and these three agree in one. If we receive the testimony of
men, the testimony of God is greater: For this is the witness which he
testifies of his son. He that believes in the son of God, has the
witness in himself. 1. Ioh. 5. verse. 7.8.9.10. Why are all these witnesses
but to give asrance of faith? And if these witnesses do testify unto a man
that he is the child of God and shall be saved (for every one that has the
true and lively faith, has it upon the testimony of all these witnesses) and
yet he is a reprobate: then is not the witness of God greater then the
witness of men. Then also to what end should be mention all these foresaid
witnesses? They give an absolute testimony that every one that believes has
life everlasting.

By these places it is manifest that the reprobate cannot be partakers of the
sanctifying faith, they be not led at any time by the spirit of adoption, they
be not sealed up with the holy spirit of promise, they have not the witness of
God within them: whosoever therefore has these things, let him be assured he
shall never perish but if he be sanctified, he is justified, he shall be
glorified. Romans 8. ver. 32. And this is it which the holy Scripture in many
places proclameth, that whosoever beieeueth in the son of God, he shall never
be confounded.

But what if the reprobate never have the true faith, nor the spirit of
adoption? yet do not the elect so fall and sin sometimes, that there is no
spark of true faith left in them for the time? This is the great cunning of
the devil to root up as it were the siablenesse and foundation of the truth.
But the word of God meets with it, and teaches, that whosoever is regenerate
and borne of God in the new and spiritual birth, as every one is that has the
lively faith, seeing whosoever is in Christ, he is a new creature: the same man
cannot so fall that this new birth should be extinguished in him. For this we
have the testimony uttered by Saint John, in these words, Whosoever is born of
god sins not, for his seed remains in him, neither can he sin, because
he is borne of God. 1. Ioh. 3. ver. 9. Also, we know that whosoever is borne
of God sins not, but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that
wicked one does not touch him. chap. 5. verse. 18. In the former of these two
sayings, there be two members, and unto either of them, there is annexed a
reason to confirm the same. As whosoever is borne of God sins not: for his
seed (this is the reason) remains in him. And then the second member,
Neither can he sin: the reason, because he is borne of God. Now see if they
do not directly gainsay the holy Ghost, which hold that a man regenerate
may loose the faith, and be utterly void of the spirit of sanctification. For
first, whereas S. John says, that whosoever is born of God, he sins not.
They say, a man has his faith vtterhe quenched, and is wholly deprived of the
spirit of adoption. What sin then is it that he sins not? He that falls in
such sort as that he becomes void of the true faith, and of the sanctifying
grace of God, what is he other but as an infidel for the time, and what sin
is it that he commits not? Shall it be said of such a man, he sins not?
It may be this poor cavil will be used, He that is borne of God sins not
so long as he continues in that estate, so long as he continues borne of God.
A vain and most foolish speech, for if a man that is unregenerate and borne of
GOD through a true and lively faith, do so fall, it is sin that casts him
down, then he does sin while he is in that state. For does he first cast
away his faith, and the grace of the sanctifying spirit, and then commit sin,
and not before? What greater sin then the falling from the faith, and casting
forth utterly the grace of sanctification? But see how Saint John meets with
all cauilles, in the reason which he annexeth to confirm that first member.
Why does not any one that is borne of God, sin? For (says he) his seed
remains in him. What is the seed of God which remains in all that are borne
of God? The word of God is called the incorruptible seed by which God does
beget his children, 1 Pet. 1.23. That word is but an instrument, the holy
Ghost is the worker of the new birth: and therefore our Savior teaches, except
a man be borne again of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God. Ioh. 3. verse 5. The seed of God then is the graces of the
sanctifying spirit, and the lively word. Those men that say, a man may lose his
faith, and the spirit of sanctification, do in flat speech contrary that
which the holy Apostle here speaks. The seed of God (says Saint John)
remains in all those which are borne of God, and therefore they do not sin,
that is to say, they do not sin that deadly sin of falling from God, or of
being separated from Christ: which is not true if their saying be true: for
there remains no seed of God in those that do wholly lose their faith, and in
whom the sanctifying graces are utterly extinguished. It may be they will here
again add their vain cavil, that the seed of God remains in them so long
as they be borne of God, and hold the faith, and stand in grace. As it Saint
John should say thus, the seed of God remains in them, so long as the seed
of God remains in them. Is not this a very wise speech to be ascribed to the
holy ghost? He speaks absolutely, that whosoever is borne of God, the seed of
God ever after does remain in him: and therefore he sins not. Let them go
with their ridiculous distinction, the feed of God remains in them, so long
as it remains in them: for that speech they must be forced to utter, unless
they will confess, that when he says his seed remains in them, we must
take it remains in them for ever. If the seed of God remain for ever in the
regenerate, then does says and the sanctifiing spirit remain in them for
ever. For will they separate these? But to put all out of doubt, and to
minister sound comfort, or (as the holy ghost speaks) strong consolation to
all that have the true and lively faith, even to let them know indeed, and
understand for certainty, that they can not perish, that they cannot be
overcome by Satan in the battle: he adds, Neither can he sin: confirming it
with this reason, because he is born of God. What can they say unto this? How
will they avoid this? Will they say that Saint John meant here some other
matter? Is it not clearer then the Sun, that the regenerate cannot wholly be
deprived of faith, nor of the spirit of sanctification, when he says, they can
not sin? Can they wholly loose their faith and all the sanctifying grace, and
yet can they not sin? O how happy and blessed is the state and condition of
that man which has attained to the true and lively faith, who has the spirit
of sanctification, by which he is led, even the spirit of adoption that
bears witness with his spirit that he is the child of God, seeing he may be
tempted, and sundry times be led a wrie into some sins, but it is impossible
that he should fall from God? And what is the reason by which he proves that
he cannot so fall: Because (says he) he is borne of God. Consider where the
force of this reason lies. Men are mortal, their seed is corruptible, and
that which is borne of man is corruptible and mortal. God is incorruptible and
immortal, and so the seed of God is called incorruptible seed and immortal:
whereupon it does follow that the birth which is of God is incorruptible and
immortal. Where the life of God is, it cannot be be extinguished. Think it
not strange then that Saint John says, he cannot sin, because he is borne of
God. Except they will deny the manifest and clear testimonies of the word of
God: except they will affirm that the seed of God is corruptible and so
decays, and does not abide in those that are begotten of God: except they
will also make the testimony of the spirit of adoption deceivable and false:
finally, except they will make the seal of God and the pledge which he gives,
of none effect, denying that men are to make their calling and election sure,
and so to have strong consolation. Let them renounce this Popish error, that
the true and lively faith, and the sanctifying spirit may be in the reprobate,
and that the same lively faith and quickening grace may be wholly put out for
a time in the elect. It may be demanded that seeing the word of God is so
evident, that men are to resist the devil steadfast in the faith, as being fully
assured that he which has once attained the lively faith can never be overcome
nor perish: what should be ye cause that some do hold that true faith and the
spirit of adoption may be had and lost again? What should cast them upon such
rocks, or drive them into such absurdities? Surely they be driven into these
while they do (as they suppose) eschew more dangerous rocks, and greater
absurdities. They would have it to be somewhat in man's own will and power to
receive faith and the whole work of regeneration. They would have it be in the
power and will of man to retain the same faith and sanctifying spirit and to
lose the^. Why are they of that mind? Is it because they envy, that god should
have the whole praise and glory of man's salvation, as man being not able to do
any thing the grace is wholly of God? We cannot say so. But it is another thing
that drives them hereunto: and that is this: they take it that unless it be in
man's will and power to receive and to retain faith, it will follow from an higher
cause, and that is this: namely that such as God has chosen unto life, to
those he gives faith and works in the^ by his spirit the new birth. Then the
other sort (if there be no power in man) cannot attain to the faith and
regeneration, they be before ordained unto eternal destruction. The^ will it
follow that there is predestination, eue^ an eternal decree of God, by which he
has chosen and ordained some to life everlasting, and appointed others to
eternal destruction. This doctrine they say charge God with injustice and
with cruelty. For what is more cruel then of purpose to create and make any
of his works or creatures to be condemned unto eternal torments? Where is
then (say they) the infinite mercy, justice and goodness of God? To charge the
Lord God with any cruelty or injustice, is most wicked, blasphemous and
abominable. And therefore they hold this the most safe course for the defense
of the justice and mercy of God, where the word of God speaks of election, to
take it thus, that GOD has chosen unto life eternal all those whom he did
foresee would receive the faith, walk in obedience and continue to the end,
and so their faith, good works and perseverance which God foresaw, is the cause
that moved the Lord to choose them. On the other side, that he has not
reprobate any, but he has foreseen that they either would not receive the
faith at al, or else after they have received it, of their own wickedness fall
from it utterly and finally, and so he has before ordained them in his
foreknowledge unto damnation. This they say stands with reason, the other
they hold to be repugnant to reason. What shall we say to this? shall we here
enter for to discourse at large by the scriptures touching election and
reprobation? I have no such purpose. But only so far as agreeeth with our
present matter, namely to make it appear, that the steadfastness of our faith,
and the full assurance of our salvation, depends upon the knowledge of our
election. As namely, if we find in us the true and lively faith, which goes
with the spirit of sanctification, we may then rise up to that high cause, and
be assured that the Lord has in that his eternal and unchangeable decree
chosen us in Christ to be his children, so that we cannot perish.

To come then to an answer to those men: Is not this a strange thing, that
they will comprehend by reason how God could decree the choice or election of
some of his creatures unto life, and the reprobation of others unto eternal
destruction for their sins, and yet not unjust? If we allege the sentence
of the Apostle, But who art thou O man that pleadest with God? They answer
that they do not plead with God, but they stand for the defense of the
justice and mercy of God, least that should be imputed unto him which is unjust
and cruel. No? Is not this to plead with God, or against God, when he shall
be just, he shall be good, he shall be merciful, no further than thy
reason can comprehend? He must yield a reason unto thy understanding and
capacity, with what right or equity he could do so, or so, or else thou will
reject it? Is not this I say, to plead against God? Saint Paul after he has
disputed of the rejecting of the Jews, and the calling in of the Gentiles,
breaks forth into this exclamation: O the deepnesse of the riches both of
the wisdom and knowledge of God: how unsearchable are his judgments and his
ways past finding out! Romans 11. To this agrees the Prophet in the Psalm,
saying, Thy iugdments are as the great deep. Let it be demanded, what
judgments of God are those which be unsearchable, or which be as the great
deep? Are they not those judgments which he executes upon his creatures, and
especially upon his chief creatures, Angels and men? If these his judgments be
as the great deep, even unsearchable and inco^prehensible both unto men and
Angels, then is it so in the highest matter, namely that he has ordained by
his eternal decree to bestow eternal life and glory upon some, and to appoint
other some unto eternal ignominy and torments, which they shall endure justly
for their sins: For if any judgments of God be unsearchable, or any
where, it is in predestination. It may be rightly said, that if the counsels,
and ways, and judgments of God be not unsearchable in that eternal decree;
then is there no judgment of god unsearchable: which is to deny not only the
saying of the Apostle and of the Prophet, but also after a sort to deny God,
for he that will make his judgments to be searchable, makes also God himself
to be searchable. Will thou measure and comprehend the counsels, the decrees,
and the judgments of God by reason? Then measure and comprehend God himself,
even that eternal and infinite majesty, with thy reason. Now if it be so,
that God has chosen some for this cause that he did foresee that of their own
will and power they would be faithful, do good works and continue to the end.
And on the other side, that he did foresee who would be unfaithful, wicked,
and rebellious even to their death, and those in his foreknowledge he saw to be
justly damned. Here is nothing incomprehensible in these judgments. For thy
reason does find out, and thy understanding does comprehend all causes, and
thou can show a reason how God has done every thing, and yet is just: yea
all the causes of his counselles he open unto thee, if it be so. Why then did
Saint Paul cry out. How unsearchable are his judgments! Why faith the Prophet
also. That they be a great deep? The Prophet was dull of conceit (it seems)
and so was Paul: for thou have entered into this great deep, and have with the
light of thy reason searched out all things, and whatsoever is not agreeable to
the same thy reason, thou doubtest not to dash it out of Gods decrees. Thou will have nothing to stand higher then thy reason can reach unto and
comprehend. Thou say that whatsoever is contrary unto reason is absurd.
Well, but take heed that thou do not extol reason too much. It does indeed
comprehend the principles of logic: but that it will from thence rise up to
comprehend God, and his eternal decree, it is extreme folly. If we look a
little in particulars, we shall find it to be so. We do believe and confess
that the Lord God by his eternal power and infinite wisdom created heaven and
earth, and al things which are in the^, both visible and invisible. Of the
invisible creatures in heaven, the Angels, some sinned and fell, whom he has
condemned unto eternal fire: they be now devils. Others (whom the holy
Apostle calls the elect Angels) never sinned, neither shall ever any of them
sin, as they be well assured, but shall remain very glorious and blessed
for ever.

Tell me now, were not all these the creatures of God, and created in the same
estate and condition? How comes it that some of them stand, and others do
fall? Will ye not say that of his infinite goodness and love, he had decreed
to stay up the one part, so that they should never sin, nor be in danger of
falling: and that he had also decreed to leave those other to their own will
and power? why did he not show the same goodness and love toward all? why
did he set so glorious creatures in such estate, as that they should fall from
the heavenly glory into devils torments? was he not able to support them, and
to retain them in glory with the rest? He created man in great dignity, even
after his own image; why did he not keep him in that estate? why did he
suffer the devil to enter in unto the woman and to tempt her? why did he not
forewarn the man and the woman, that such an enemy would set upon them? or
why did he not give the^ strength to get the victory in that temptation? O
will thou say, God did only suffer those things to be done by the devil: he
did not ordain that any such matter should fall out: for that cannot stand
with equity or justice: it agrees not with mercy. Well, thou have a child, and
when it is in thy power to let, yet thou wittinglie do suffer a terrible
Lion to enter in unto him and to devour him: who will say that this is a
sufficient excuse to clear thee from cruelty: to say that thou did not
decree it, but only suffer it to come so to pass? If this be no excuse to
defend thee, how foolish art thou in using it to defend the justice and mercy
of God? VVilt thou thus call the justice of God and his mercy under the
account of thy reason, that thou may by thine own wit comprehend it, or else
it cannot be justice? O how much better is it that thou should cry out
with the Apostle, How unsearchable are his judgments! And where thou can not
comprehend by reason how God should in justice either decree or suffer the
fall of Angels and men; yet to rest in this, that howsoever we cannot
comprehend those things, yet we are sure that there can be no unrighteousness
with God: but whatsoever he decrees, it is most holy and just, for his will
is the perfect rule of all righteousness.

To proceed, when man was fallen, and had cast himself and all his posterity
into endless misery, a redeemer is promised. All are lost alike, there be
none which are in themselves better or more worthy than other, why then is not
the redeemer sent unto all? If any shall reply and say he was sent unto all:
that is untrue: for God chose the seed of Abraham, the nation of the Jews, he
separated them from al other nations of the world, he gave them his laws and
ordinances, even the lively Oracles for to teach them. The other nations he
left in the dark, to walk in the vanities of their own mind, subject to the
manifold illusions and sleightes of diuelles, and that for many ages together,
among whom there were so many famous wise men, Philosophers, Poets and
Orators. Yea there were among them infinite thousand thousands which could never
hear of Christ, and of infants dying and perishing in their native corruption,
that is, in original sin. Who can search out and comprehend the judgments
of God in this? were they not the work of his hands? Yet there is no hope
offered unto them. But at the length Christ Jesus, the only light and salvation
of the world, is preached to the Gentiles. Why did he not now open the eyes
of all? why did he not give that effectual grace of his spirit unto all as to
believe in his son unto salvation? When he opened the heart of Lydia, why did
he not also open the hearts of the rest that heard Paul preach? Some will say
they would not. Yea but he of those that were most unwilling made willing
where it pleased him: As we have a perfect example in Saint Paul, who was a
cruel persecuter. Christ says, No man comes unto me, except the father
which sent me draw him. Ioh. 6. Why did he not draw Herod, and Pilate and
the high Priests, as well as Paul? We see in these latter days that there
be great Nations, as the west Indies, which had never heard of Christ until
of late time, and then by a most cruel and idolatrous people which have
murdered them most wickedlie, so that they have been made to stumble and to
be further from Christ. Who is able to comprehend the depth of these
judgments? Shall not we lay down the pride of our own understanding, and
say with the Apostle, Has not the Potter power over the claie, of the same
lump to make one vessel unto honor and an other unto dishonor? Or shall the
thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have thou made me thus? O beloved,
let us lay aside all such vain and curious presumptions: and let us, as the
holy Scripture directs us make our singular comfort of that eternal decree
of God. Thus we are with it to fortify our selves against the Devil. God of
his own good will has chosen in his son Jesus Christ, even before the
foundations of the world were laid, those whom he will save, as the heirs
of eternal glory. He has in his prefixed time redeemed them, not with gold
or precious stones, (as Saint Peter says) but with the blood of his son, as
of a Lamb immaculate and without spot. He does also call them, he does
sanctify them. This decree of God is unchangeable, it is impossible that any
of his elect should perish. Who can pluck them out of the hands of Christ?
Then in the next place we are to be assured that none can have the true faith
but the chosen of God. Not any do receive the spirit of adoption which
witness unto their spirit that they be the children of God but the elect. The
elect are only regenerate and borne of God, and sealed with the holy spirit
of promise.

Then come down to thy self: If thou can truly say, I have the lively
faith, I have received the spirit of adoption, which does witness with my
spirit that I am the child of God: I am regenerate, I have the true
repentance, I am sanctified: Satan does tempt me strongly many ways, but I
am sure, though he often as it were foil thee, and cause me to go awrie, that
he shall never get the victory over me. Is not this a singular comfort to a
man? If any that has the spirit of adoption may lose him: then where is the
steadfastness of faith which Saint Peter here requires, in resisting the
Devil? If it come once to lie in our selves, we cannot be undoubtedly sure
and steadfast: we may well waver and doubt: but when we know that we are kept
by the power of God, as it is written, 1. Pet. 1. Then have we a rock whereon
to rest: then do we stand steadfast armed with the power of God.

This faith may be tried, and seem oftentimes to be sore shaken, but it can
never be overcome. Yea, will some man say, but every man cannot come to know
that he has received the true and lively faith, or the spirit of adoption, we
see many go far in the profession of the gospel, and think that they have
the true faith, and the sanctifying spirit, which yet fall quite away. It is
true that there be many which embrace the gospel and profess it with such
feeling that they suppose God has called them as his children: there is for
the time such a touch and such a moving in their hearts, and yet in time they
manifest themselves not to be of God. One occasion or other drives them awrie,
so that some of them become heretics, some of the^, although they fall not
into heresies, yet they fall into vices, and become so irreligious, that all
the former graces which they had tasted of, do vanish and are lost. And this
is the cause we are willed by Saint Peter to make our calling and election
sure. For seeing the reprobate receive a kind of faith and zeal, which yet is
not the true and lively faith, we are willed to be diligent and careful to see
that we rest not in that faith. We must labor to attain to that testimony of
the spirit of adoption: we must seek to be confirmed and even sealed with the
holy spirit of promise, and so come to that full assurance of faith and hope
which never confounds. And that is it which Saint Peter teaches the way to
come unto, in the place before alleged, where he wills us to join virtue
with our faith, with virtue knowledge, etc. For if we follow that rule which
he there prescribes, we shall be sure never to fall, we shall then with a
steadfast faith resist our adversary the devil, and get the victory over him.
It is a matter of great importance, I pray and beseech you, as you tender the
happy estate of your own souls, look unto it. Set your hearts upon the
lively Oracles of God, and seek day and night after the knowledge of holy
things, and how to please the Lord your God. Then shall you be blessed for
evermore, Amen.

FINIS.
