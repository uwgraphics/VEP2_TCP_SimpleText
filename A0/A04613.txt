TO THE HONORABLE AND VIRTUOUS GENTLEMAN SIR ROBERT SIDNEY, KNIGHT GOVERNOR
UNDER HER MAJESTY OF THE TOWN OF VLUSHING, AND THE CASTLE OF THE Ramekins IN
THE LOW COUNTRIES, AND OF the forts of the same appendant, with the garrison
therein placed as well of horse as foot.
YOUR great love and favor Honorable Sir, ever manifested to all worthy
Sciences, has imboldened me to offer up at your Lordships Shryne, these the
unworthy labors of my musical travels. And though in respect of their
weakness, they may perhaps seem untimely brought forth, and therefore the
vnlikelier to prosper; yet doubt I not but if tenderd by you, they shall
happily find gentle cherishing, which may be a mean to make them more
stronger, or else miscarrying, to encourage my endeavors to beget a better: for
as no arts wincks at fewer errors than music: so none greater enemies to
their own profession then musicians; who whilst in their own singularity,
they condemn every man's works, as some way faulty, they are the cause, the
art is the less esteemed, and they themselves reputed as selfe-commenders, and
men most fantastical. Wherefore if this one censuring infirmity were removed,
these my airs (free I dare say from gross errors) would find every where
more gracious entertainment. But since even those, who are best seen in this
art, cannot vaunt themselves free from such detractours, I the less regard it
being so well accompanied. Howsoever if herein I may gain your Honors good
allowance, I shall think I have attained to the better end of my labors
(which with my self, and the best of my service) restes ever more at your
Lordships imploiment.

Your Lordships devoted in all dutiful service. ROBERT JONES.

TO THE READER
GENTLEMEN, since my desire is your ears should be my indifferent judges, I
cannot think it necessary to make my travels, or my bringing up arguments to
persuade you that I have a good opinion of my self, only thus much will I
say: That I may prevent the rash judgments of such as know me not. Ever since
I practiced speaking, I have practiced singing; having had noe other quality
to hinder me from the perfect knowledge of this faculty, I have been encouraged
by the warrant of diverse good judgments, that my pains herein shall at the
least procure good liking, if not delight, which yet for mine own part I must
needs fear as much as I desire, especially when I consider the ripenes of
this industrious age, wherein all men endeavor to know all things, I confess
I was not unwilling to embrace the conceits of such gentlemen as were earnest
to have me apparel these ditties for them; which though they intended for their
private recreation, never meaning they should come into the light, were yet
content upon entreaty to make the encouragements of this my first adventure,
whereupon I was almost glad to make my small skill known to the world:
presuming that if my cunning failed me in the Music: yet the words might
speak for themselves, howsoever it pleases them to account better of that,
then of those. Of purpose (as it should seem) to make me believe I can do
something; my only hope is, that seeing neither my cold airs, not their idle
ditties (as they will needs have me call them) have hitherto been sounded in
the ears of many: they may chance to find such entertainment, as commonly
news does in the world: which if I may be so happy to bear, I will not say
my next shall be better, but I will promise to take more pains to show more
points of music, which now I could not do, because my chiefest care was to
fit the Note to the Word, till when, I must be as well content with each man's
lawful censure, as I shall be glad of some men's undeserved favors.

CANTVS
^ A Woman's looks are barbed hooks, that catch ^ ^ by art the strongest heart,
when yet they spend no breath, but let them speak ^ ^ and sighing break, forth
into tears, their words are spears, yt wound our souls to death. ^ ^

2
The rarest wit
Is made forget,
And like a child
Is often beguild,
With loves sweet seeming bait:
Love with his rod
So like a God,
Commands the mind
We cannot find,
Fair shows hide foul deceit.
3
Time that all things
In order bringes,
Has taught me now
To be more slow,
In giving faith to speech:
Since women's words
No truth affordes,
And when they kiss
They think by this,
Us men to ouer-reach.

CANTVS
^ FOnd wanton youths, fond wanton youths ^ ^ make love a God, which after
proves ages rod, their youth, their time, their wit, their ^ ^ art, they
spend in seeking of their smarte, and which of follies is the chief, they ^ ^
woo their woe, they woo their woe, they wedde their grief. ^

2
All find it so who wedded are,
Loves sweetes they find enfold sour care:
His pleasures pleasingst in the eye,
Which tasted once, with lothing die:
They find of follies it is the chief,
Their woe to woo to wedde their grief.
3
If for their own content they choose,
Forthwith their kindreds love they loose:
And if their kindred they content,
For ever after they repent.
O it is of all our follies chief,
Our woe to woo to wedde our grief.
4
In bed what strifes are bred by day,
Our puling vviues do open lay:
None friends none foes we must esteem,
But whom they so vouchsafe to deem:
O it is of all our follies chief,
Our woe to woo to vvedde our grief.
5
Their smiles we want if ought they want,
And either we their wills must grant,
Or die they will or are with child,
Their laughings must not be beguild:
O it is of all our follies chief,
Our woe to vvoo to vvedde our grief,
6
Foul vviues are jealous, fair vviues false,
Marriage to either binds us thrall:
Wherefore being bound we must obey,
And forced be perforce to say*
Of all our bliss it is the chief,
Our woe to vvooe to wed our grief.

CANTVS
^ SHe whose matchles beauty stayneth, what best judgment ^ ^ fairst
maintains, she O she my love dis- dai- neth, she O she my ^ ^ love
disdaineth. ^

2
Can a creature so excelling,
Harbor scorn in beauties dwelling,
All kind pity thence expelling?
3
Pity beauty much commends,
And th'imbracer often befriendeth,
When all eye contentment ends.
4
Time proves beauty transitory
Scorn; the stain of beauties glory,
In time makes the scorner sorry.
5
None adores the sun declining,
Love all love falls to resigning,
When the sun of love leaves shining.
6
So when flower of beauty fails thee,
And age stealing on assailes thee,
Then mark what this scorn auailes thee.
7
Then those hearts which now complaining,
Feel the wounds of thy disdaining,
Shall contemn thy beauty waining.
8
Yea thine own heart now dear prized,
Shall with spite and grief surprised,
Burst to find it self despised.
9
When like harms have them requited,
Who in others harms delighted,
Pleasingly the wronged are righted.
10
Such revenge my wrongs attending,
Hope still lives on time depending,
By thy plagues my torments ending.
ALTVS.
^ She whose matchless beauty stay- neth, what best judgment ^ fairst

CANTVS
^ ONce did I love and yet I live, though ^ ^ love and truth be now for-
gotten. Then did I joy now do I grieve, that holy ^ ^ vows must needs be
broken, that holy vows must needs be broken. ^ ^

2
Hers be the blame that causd it so,
Mine be the grief though it be little,
She shall have shame I cause to know:
What it is to love a dame so fickle.
3
Love her that list I am content,
For that Camelion like she changes,
Yielding such mistes as may prevent*
My sight to view her when she rangeth.
4
Let him not vaunt that gains my loss,
For when that he and time has proved her,
She may him bring to weeping cross:
I say no more because I loved her.
ALTVS.
^ ONce did I love and yet I live and yet I live, though love and truth be now
^ forgotten, then did I joy now do I grieve, now do I grieve that holy vows

CANTVS
^ LEd by a strong de- sire to have a thing un- ^ ^ seen, nothing could make
me tire to be to be to be where as I had been, ^ ^ I got her sight which
made me think, my thirst was gone because I saw my drink. ^

2
Kept by the careful watch
Of more then hundred eyes,
I sought but could not catch
The thing she not denies:
It Is better to be blind and fast,
Then hungry see thy love and cannot taste.
3
But lovers eyes do wake
When others are at rest,
And in the night they slake
The fire of days unrest:
Me thinks that joy is of most worth,
Which painful time and passed fears brings forth.
4
Yet husbands do suppose
To keep their wives by art,
And parents will disclose
By looks their childrens heart:
As if they which have will to do,
Had not the wit to blind such keepers to.
5
Peace then ye aged fools
That know your selves so wise,
That from experience schools
Do think wit must arise:
Give young men leave to think and say,
Your senses with your bodies do decay.
6
Love rules like a God
Whom earth keeps not in awe,
Nor fear of smarting rod
Denounced by reasons law:
Give grave advise but rest you there,
Youth has his course, and will, and you youths were.
7
Think not by prying care
To pick loves secrets out,
If you suspicious are
Your selves resolve your doubt,
Who seeks to know such deed once done,
Finds perjury before confession.
ALTVS.
^ LEd by a strong de- sire to have a thing unseen, no-thing could ^ make me
tire, to be to be to be to be where I had been, I got her ^ sight which
made me think, my thirst was gone, because I saw my drink. ^

BASSVS.

CANTVS
^ LIe down poor heart and die a while for ^ ^ grief, think not this world
will ever do thee good, fortune fore- warnes y^ look to ^ ^ thy relief, and
sorrow sucks upon thy living blood, then this is all can help thee ^ ^ of this
hell, lie down and die, lie down and die, and then thou shall do well. ^

2
Day gives his light but to thy labors toil,
And night her rest but to thy weary bones,
Thy fairest fortune follows with a foil:
And laughing ends but with their after groans.
And this is all can help thee of thy hell,
Lie down and die and then thou shall do well.
3
Patience does pine and pity ease no pain,
Time wears the thoughts but nothing helps ye mind,
Dead and alive alive and dead again:
These are the fits that thou art like to find.
And this is all can help thee of thy hell,
Lie down and die and then thou shall do well*

is the tongue forced to prolong, and smother up his suite, while that his smart ^
^ while that his smart, like fire suppressed like fire suppressed, flames more in
every part. ^ ^

2
Who dares not speak deserves not his desire,
The Boldest face,
Finds most grace:
Though women love that men should the^ admire,
They slily laugh at him dares come no higher.
3
Some think a glaunce expressed by a sigh,
Winning the field,
Makes them yield:
But while these glauncing fools do roll the eye,
They beat the bush, away the bird does fly.
4
A gentle heart in virtuous breast does stay,
Pity does dwell,
In beauties cell:
A woman's heart does not though tongue say nay
Repentance taught me this the other day.
5
Which had I wist I presently had got,
The pleasing fruit,
Of my long suite:
But time has now beguild me of this lot,
For that by his foretop I took him not.

CANTVS
^ HEro care not though they pry, I will love thee till I die, ^ ^ Ie- lou-
sie is but a smart, that torments a ielous heart: Crows are black ^ ^ that
were white, for betraying loves delight. ^ ^

2
They that love to find a fault,
May repent what they have sought,
What the fond eye has not viewed,
Never wretched heart has rew'd:
Vulcan then, proved a scorn,
When he saw he wore a horn.
3
Does it then by might behoue,
To shut up the gates of love,
Women are not kept by force,
But by natures own remorse.
If they list, they will stray,
Who can hold that will away.
4
Jove in golden shower obtained,
His love in a tower restrained,
So perhaps if I could do,
I might hold my sweet love to:
Gold keep out at the door,
I have love that conquers more.
5
Wherefore did they not suspect,
When it was to some effect,
Every little glimmering spark,
Is perceived in the dark:
This is right, how lets kind,
See by night, by day be blind.

CANTVS
^ WHen love and time and measure makes his ground, time that must end ^ ^
though love can never die, it is love betwixt a shadow and a sound, a love not in

down now ^ ^ down, a mornings favor and an euenings frown. ^

2
Sweet looks show love, yet they are but as beams,
Fair words seem true, yet they are but as wind,
Eyes shed their tears yet are but outward streams:
Sighs paint a sadness in the falsest mind.
Looks, words, tears, sighs, show love when love they leave,
False hearts can weep, sigh, swear, and yet deceive.

2
Farewell, farewell, since this I find is true,
I will not spend more time in wooing you:
But I will seek else where,
If I may find her there,
Shall I bid her go,
What and if I do?
Shall I bid her go and spare not,
O no no no no I dare not.
3
Ten thousand times farewell, yet stay a while,
Sweet kiss me once, sweet kisses time beguile:
I have no power to move,
How now, am I in love?
Will thou needs be gone?
Go then, all is one,
Will thou needs be gone? oh hie thee,
Nay, stay and do no more deny me.

Once more farewell, I see loath to depart,
Bids often adieu to her that holds my heart:
But seeing I must loose,
Thy love which I did choose:
Go thy ways for me,
Since it may not be,
Go thy ways for me, but whither?
Go, oh but where I may come thither.

What shall I do? my love is now departed,
She is as fair as she is cruel hearted:
She would not be entreated,
With prayers often repeated:
If she come no more,
Shall I die therefore,
If she come no more, what care I?
Faith, let her go, or come, or tarry.

By making mountains of a mouse:

Poor women are too credulous.
To think that we admiring stand,
Or foot, or face, or foolish hand.
