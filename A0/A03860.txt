The Muse to her Author.
W WHy fear thou this gift to give,
though gift of gifts be small?
I If love and zeal thy gift surmount,
No cause of fear at all.
(...) Let love with guist the trial make,
and so it shall appear,
I If troth be foreman of the quest,
wi^ (...) i^ passes clear.
A And w^y to whom the gift is given,
such one as love does hold,

Where spring is small, great streams may not be ^ail,
Yes as it is, do make the owner glad,

The Creation of the World.
How Heaven and earth the light and sky
The Sun, the Moon, and stars so hie:
How beasts and fowls, how Fish and Man
Created was of God, and when.
The work of the first day.
He^ God which no beginning had,
the heaven and earth began frame, The spirit God mo^ on the wa^

^d void and empty it beheld,
^ith darkness on the same.
and on the waters which he made, God sa^^^ the light (...) go^ did c^ the

between the waters so,
As part above * the same did rest,
the other part * below.
And gave a name thereto, and said
it heaven * shall called be:
The evening and the morning ek^
the second day you see.
The work of the third day.
THe third day at his holy hest,
the waters underneath
Compelled were together go,
in one place of the earth.
And then the land appeared dry,
which * Earth was called tho,
And bad it should bring forth gr^
ingendring seed to gro. (* h^
And fruitful trees of sundry sor^
that seed might still retain,
And bring forth fruit each after ki^
that on the earth remain.
Thus every thing came so to pass,
as God before did say: (fruit,
The earth brought herb and tree with
that still engender may.
The work of the fourth day.

God bad that in the firmament,
there should be placed * lights. These ligh^ were the (...) (...) and (...)

which should remain from tim to time

The sun he made the day to rule,

and shining stars in heaven he set,
whose light does aye abide.

God* blessed both and bad them gr^
the fish the sea to fill:
And feathered foul upon the earth,
their kind increasing still.
The work of the Sixth Day.
Now let ye earth bring forth said Go^
each living thing by kind:

Thus when God saw his handy wo^
was good and pleased him well:
Let us make man like us, said he,

The hallowing of the sabbath day,
The four floods of Paradise gay:
How in the same man had his seat.

How Adam named Creatures al,
How Eve was made that first did fall:

Between them twa^ne yer they did sin.

a living soul became,
By breath of life that God did breath,
in nostrils of the man.
And from the first god planted had,
a garden fair to see:
Wherein he set this man he made,
the keeper for to be.
And from ye earth god made to spring
all fruitful trees so placed,
As both might well the eye delight,
and please the mouth in taste.
Two trees amid this garden grew,
by power of sacred skill:
The one of life, the other was
of knowledge good and ill.
From Eden went a river forth,
to moist this garden than:
Which afterward divided was,
and in four heads became.
And Pishon is the first of four,
which round about does go,
The golden land of Hauilah,
where the Onix stone does gro.
The second head is Gi^on calde,
which compasses throughout.
The land of Ethyopia,
with water round about.
The third is named Hidekell,
that passes down along
The east side of Assyria,
with mighty stream and strong.
And Euphrates the fourth is called,
which fruitfulness does show,
And in the same does many gems,
and precious stones forth grow.
Almighty God this Adam took
and in this garden set:
The same to dress, the same to keep
and of the fruit to eat.
Of every tree that therein was,
God bade him eat his fill,
Except the tree that is in the midst,
of knowledge good and ill.
God said, ye day thou eat'st thereof
thou for the same shall die:
Therefore see that thou touch it not
the taste thereof to try.
It is not good (said God) that man
should be alone I see:
I will an helper make to him,
companion his to be.
Out of ye ground did god the^ mak^
each beast upon the earth,
And every foul in the air that flies
and all that draws breath.
And God did bring al beasts and fowls,
to view of Adams eye,
which was to see what kind of name
he then would call them by.
And Adam called every beast,
and every soul by name,
^s we do use at this same day
to nominate the same.
In slumber then was Adam cast,
and God a rib did take
^om forth his side, and of the same
a woman did he make:
and filled the place with flesh again
and when he did awake:
This is said he, bone of my bones,
and flesh of mine I see:
^rago, shall she called be,
as taken out of me:
And for this cause shall every one
his parents dear forsake,
and cleave unto his wife alone,
and both one flesh shall make.
FINIS.
Adams banishment.
The person of God. IAm, and will be, as I was,
before the world was wrought:
I made the heavens, the earth and
^and all therein of naught. (sea,
^nely for thy use (O man)
these mighty works did frame,
^d made thee Lord, and governor,
^and ruler of the same.
^ae't thee here in Paradise,
^and gave thee will to choose,
^ether my word thou would obey
^or else the same refuse.
^t thou unkind, and most unkind,
through infidelity,
^dst taste the fruit I thee forbad,
of good, and evil to be.
^d yet by death I threatened thee,
that thou therefore should die,
^hou presumdst the fruit to eat,
that I did thee deny.
^ere did thou show thy unbelief,
and thoughtst my words untrue:
And thereupon did pride arise,
and foul ambition grew.
Ungrateful wast thou found thee^
for that thou couetdst more
then I thee gave: yet for the sam^
not thankful wast therefore.
Do thou the son of slime and eart^
think it a thing but small,
To make thee like unto our self?
but would thou therewithal,
Be like to us in Deity,
to know what we do know?
This moved our wrath from heaven
our angels down to throw. (bo^

The person of Adam. O Lord give earth and ashes le^
with fear to speak to thee:
Thou knewst before that I should (...)
yer time was known to be.
And yer the angels kind were mad^
thou knewst the fall of man:
And of all things did see the end,
yer thou the same began.
Thou might ye same prevented ha^
if so had been thy will:
And I in great felicity,
might have continued still.

GOD. ^as my foreknowledge then ye cause
of this thy wilful fall?
^r dare thou yet so proudly think,
as me the causer call?
^hou art thy self both fault and cause.
and thou the same shall find,
^o be thy disobedience,
and proud aspiring mind.
^hou had my law for to observe,
which law if thou had kept:
^here had bin no transgressio^ made
nor sin in thee had crept.
^ost true it is, I see the end
of every thing I make,
before it was: as proof there is,
when I did undertake,
^o fashion thee, and creatures all,
in heaven and earth that be,
^ho then could tell, but I alone,
and other twain with me?
and where thou say, I might thy fall,
have helped to the best:
might not with my justice stand,
nor with my glory rest.
^or I am truth, and truth I speak,
and truth shall witness be.
That thou shall die for eating fruit,
of the forbidden tree.
What can thou say now for thy self
thou should not judgment have
And die the death for thine offense,
as I thee warning gave?

Adam. O Lord my God, I sorry was,
when I my fault did see:
And was surprisde with shame and fe^
for so offending thee.
I hid my self among the trees,
ne durst I be so bold,
Before thy presence to appear,
nor yet my self behold.
Such shame and fear had co^past (...)
about on every side:
I knew not where my self bestow,
nor where my self to hide.
If sorrow mine, if shame and fear,
may not thy favor win:
Alas, what else to think or speak,
I know not to begin.

GOD. SVch sorrow, fear, and shame as thi^
but agrauates mine ire:
^ou shuldst have feared before ye seltst
the fruit thou did desire.
and yet before thou did it touch,
thou had committed sin:
^cause thou couetdst in thy self,
more higher to have bin.
^nce in thy will and choice it lay,
to leave or else to take,
and ye have taken thou shuldst have left,
I must for justice sake,
^ue sentence on thy sinful deed,
as I before have said.
^st thou ought else more for to say,
why judgment should be staid?

ADAM. O Lord my God, what shall the pot
unto the potter say?
^ou have me made of filth and slime,
of brittle earth and clay.
^d as the potter turns his wheel,
with lump of clay in hand,
^ereof to shape a vessel pure,
before his eye to stand:
the end that vessel should be used,
with juice of grapes the best,
(...) thense to drink, such thirst to (...),
as bideth in the breast.
So Lord, if that abused be,
and filth therein remain,
Yet can the potter when he please
the same make clean again:
And being clean may be imploy^
unto the potters will,
To eat or drink in, as shall please
the cunning potters skill.
Yet with all meekness I confess,
with no less fear I speak,
If pot the potter he mislike,
may soon in pieces break.
But if it would the potter please,
to prove his power withal,
And see how weak the vessel is,
the conquest were but small.

GOD. THe greatest conquest I do man
my truth is to maintain,
I am the truth, and only truth,
for ever to remain.
The word I speak is verament,
and may not be denide:
As I by truth, and thou by fault,
shall judged be and tried.
Adam, Adam, hold up thy hand,
this is thy judgment day.

Adam. O Lord vouchsafe to license dust,
a little more to say.
^ehold how prostrate I do lie,
before thy blessed face:
^ehold my fearful quiuering heart,
most humbly craving grace.
^ehold the sobs and grievous groans,
my inward soul does make:
and let not perish thou have made,
for thy great glories sake.
^f needs thou will thy justice show,
by judgment to proceed,
^hen let the party made the offense,
be punished for the deed.
(...) was not I the fruit first touched,
nor plucked it from the tree,
(...) was the woman thou me gave,
my helper for to be.
^he plucked it off, and tasting it,
she gave it me, and said,
^ehold how fair and sweet it is,
to eat be not afraid,
^he first did eat, and after, I
did eat thereof also.
^raue with all humility,
thou will no rigor show.

GOD. And would thou now thy self ex^
and put on her the blame:
Whereas you both offenders be,
and guilty of the same?
When she a rib was in thy side,
I gave the charge to thee,
And bad thee eat of every fruit,
save only of that tree.
And now is she bone of thy bone,
and flesh of thine also:
Not fleshes twain but both one fl^
together for to go.
So both are guilty of the crime,
whereof thou art Accusde:
And offspring yours shall in like for
thereof not be excusde.
But woman, why did thou this d^
your selves with death to greeu^

WOMAN. O Lord, the serpent me deceived,
whose words I did believe.

GOD. The Serpent ^ursed.
THou subtle guilfull serpent the
because thou thus have don:
Thou art accursed above all beasts
that in the fields do won.
Upon thy belly thou shall go,
and dust shall be thy meat:
And all the days thou have to live,
no other thing shall eat.
Twixt thee and her of enmity,
I will the seeds forth sow:
As that between thy seed and hirs
continual strife shall grow.
The seed of her shall crush thy head,
and tread in pieces small:
And thou shall tread upon his heel,
but not prevail at all.
The Woman's Judgment.
But Woman unto thee I say,
thy judgment shall be this:
Because thou have intised man,
by sin to do amiss,
Thy sorrows will I multiply,
when thou conceived art:
and thou thy children shall bring forth,
with dolor, pain, and smart:
and underneath thy husbands power,
shall alvvaies subject be,
and he shall have the charge and rule,
and government of thee.
ADam, Adam, hold up thy hand,
this judgment shall thou have,
Because thou have transgrest the law
that I unto thee gave:
And bent thine ear unto thy wife,
to harken what she said,
And taken and eaten, of the fruit,
that I to thee denaid:
I curse the ground even for thy sake,
and cursed shall it be:
In sorrow shall thou eat thereof,
while life is lent to thee.
Wild thorn also and thistleweed,
it shall bring sorth and yield:
And thou shall feed upon the fruit
that grows in the field.
With painful travel great and strong
with sweat upon thy face,
Thy bread shall eat, till thou return
to earth thy former place:
For of the earth, and from the earth,
thou earth do still remain:
And from the earth, unto the earth,
thou earth shall go again.
TO think what pitious more they (man
what clamors and what cries,
Such time as God the^ both drove forth
from heavenly paradise:
What wringing hads, what folding arms
what tears from blubbering eyes:
How often they set them down to weep,
how often again they rise,
How often their heavy heads they rear,
and faces to the skies:
How often each other could embrace,
in lamentable guise,
How often deep sighs the heart se^ds forth,
where all the sorrow lies:
Might urge us all from them that sprang
to wail with them likewise.
Again to think how every beast,
and every foul withal,
Which heretofore obedient were,
and came at Adams call,
^oo now from Adams presence fly,
as fearful of his sight,
and in the woods and deserts wild
do take their whole delight.
^o think whereas he was before,
each thing did grow by kind.
which he as then might take at will,
to pleasure of his mind.
^e tree of life to be his meat,
by death no time to fall,
And every creature that was made,
to solace him withal.
How he likewise deuoid of shame,
might children there beget,
And woman to bring sorth the same,
without all grief and let:
Must now with painful travel sore,
go dig and delue the earth,
Yer it can yield him any food,
wherewith to feed his breath:
To think how many hundred years,
his travel did him grieve.
And how each day brought sorrows (...)
the time he had to live:
Might move with ruth a marble mind,
it self to mollify,
But even to think or hear of this,
poor Adams tragedy.

Christ his Crib.
WHat fury haunteth us,
that we so much delight,
To stand and gaze on momuments,
of ancient former sight?
Of pleasure what find we,
in sumptuous buildings new:
^uch as our ancestors before,
the like nere saw nor knew?
^ehold the time is such,
vanity bears sway:
and fancy fond the wit does rule,
till both come to decay.
^or every private man,
a modull takes in hand,
^here wit and will, and wealth do meet,
are many platformes scand.
^ome costly buildings rear,
and pull them down again:
and othersome altar and change,
as fancy feeds the brain.
and some foundation lays,
and yer the work be done:
Does take his leave and goes his way,
and leaves it to his son.
The son does much mislike
the work the father wrought,
And yer his fancy can be fed,
consumes himself to naught.
Of other some there be,
having of treasure store:
Which when a work they finished have,
yet still deuiseth more.
What pleasure now have such,
in lieu of cost and pain,
For only but to seed the eye,
is vanity most vain.
But if you feign would see,
a monument indeed:
Then go with me, and run apace,
the better shall we speed.
I will you show a sight,
more worth to view and see:
Then all the buildings on the earth,
what ever so they be.
And such a sight it is,
as all the fathers old:
And ancestors before their time,
the like did nere behold.
And all that live this day,
and on the earth remain:
Nor any after age that comes,
shall see the same again.
Behold lo here it is,
a Cabin poor God knows:
Beerent and torn, a rustie thing,
unfurnished with shows,
Of outward sight to see,
a simple thatched cot:
Where ^leet and snow, and rain drives in,
a ruynde place God wot.
And yet within the same,
a blessed babe does lie:
Which yields sorth as insants do,
many a tender cry.
This babe, even at whose beck,
the thunder makes to quake:
The earth beneath in trembling sort,
and lofty sky to shake.
Even here this insant does
(being a mighty prince:
And sovereign ruler of the world,
that shall his foes convince)
Suck milk from tender breast,
of blessed Mary sure:
Being his mother and a wife,
and yet a virgin pure.
(...) am no whit afraid,
comparison to make:
This homely Cabin to prefer,
for this sweet Babies sake,
Before the buildings great
of stately Temples all,
And sumptuous courts and palaces,
of princes great and small.
This stable does surmount,
the costly Temple wrought,
With curious work by Solomon,
which (as of right it ought)
Must yield and base it self,
and stoop this place unto,
In which was borne the son of God,
as was his will to do.
So must that glorious court,
of that high potentat,
King Cresus he of Lydia,
stand back to this estate.
And let the Capitols
that dedicated were,
In old time past with Idols theirs,
Unto Dan Jupiter.
Which though they garnisht were
most magnificentlie:
With fine and curious workmanship,
of marble imag'rie:
Now yield this stable to,
as subjects bond and thrall,
As no whit to compared be,
to this in ought at all.
Let Lady Rome strike sail,
and under hatches go,
With stately turrets of defense,
her walls and gates also.
And let her capitol,
with glass and gold araide:
And temple Olauitrium
now shake and be afraid.
And let her house of gold,
bedeckt with precious stone,
Give place with all humility,
to this poor cot alone.
^or now is fallen to ground,
the Image made of gold:
^n likeness to king Romulus,
which should together hold,
And stand for evermore,
until such time a child
should forth proceed and so be borne,
of virgin meek and mild.
The image made o^ brass,
in woman's portraiture:
^o high, so great, and hugie was,
for ever to endure.
Which now is likewise fallen,
even at the artsman said:
Yet still shall stand until a child
proceeds from a maid.
ALl Hail most rovall house,
possessor of all grace:
That was so highly dignifide,
to be the only place
Of such an holy birth,
whereby thou art to see,
More happy then the heaven it self
by this Nativity.
And neither may this cot
be thought a whit the less,
Meet to receive the Savior
of all our trespasses.
For that the walls thereof,
were broken or berent:
Subject to wind and weather such,
as storms and tempest sent.
Neither for that it was
without all furniture:
As sheets and other-needfull things,
as daily be in ure.
Having but only this,
which there by chance they found,
Offtebble rough, and thistle hay,
that lay upon the ground.
And notwithstanding this,
as you have heard beforne:
Did yet receive this little babe,
so soon as it was borne.
For such an homely crib,
and stable poor and thin,
Did well become our savior Christ,
for to be borne therein.
As he that to the world,
came hither purposely:
To give example unto us,
of great humility.
And to condemn dame pride,
and thrust her under foot:
Which is of sin and vices all,
both branches, tree, and root
In this poor thatched house,
here is no rich array:
As hangings fair of purple hue,
nor cloth of arras ga^e.
In this poor silly cot,
there is no stus^e at all,
No chamber great, nor parlor sruas,
no kitchen, ne no hall.
Within this homely cell,
there was not to be seen,
Of any fuel, wood or cole,
a ^ier for to teene.
There is not in this cooch,
expected for to see,
Of delicates and iunkets fine,
nor dainty cheer to be.
Within this cabin poor,
ye shall not here behold,
Great troops of men for to attend,
in silver, silk, ne gold.
Nor yet the childwife lie,
in soft and stately bed:
With quilts of silk to keep her warm,
nor pillow for her head.
No, no, but here does lie,
in manger hard and cold:
An amiable in fant sweet,
more sweet than may be told.
Bewrapt and lapt in clouts,
both poor and bare God wot,
And swathed in such swathing clothes,
as then there might be got.
And though that he now borne,
in homely sort thus lay,
Yet was his divine majesty
declared that same day.
For to the Shepherds came,
that watched their flocks by night,
The angel of the most high God,
shining with beams so bright,
As made them so afraid,
they stood in doubtful stay,
^till the angel of the Lord,
^hus wise to them could say:
^re not, behold, I bring
^o you such gladsome news,
(...) all the world shall joy thereat,
^eaue off therefore to muse.
(...) unto you this day
(...) savior Christ is borne:
^u shall him find in manger laid,
^he walls be rent and torn.
^orthwith with th'angell was
(...) maru'lous multitude
^heauenly fouldiors praising God,
^n this sort to conclude:
^orie to God on high,
and peace on earth below,
^d unto men rejoicing great,
that this believe and show.
after came to pass,
When the angels went away,
(...) into heaven from whense they came;
^he shepherds then did say:
(...) us to Bethleem go,
^hese tidinges to behold,
^d so went out, and when they came,
^hey found as th'angell told:
^e babe in manger laid,
and Joseph that good man,
Was hard him by who prostrately,
this work of God to scan:
Began with a lowly heart
and humble spirit most mild,
Fall on his knees, and worshipped
his newborn softer child.
The shepherds seeing this,
did publish unto all,
What th'angell said, and they had se^
each thing as did befall:
And back again they went,
and praised God on hie,
That they had seen the son of Go^
in manger thus to lie.
Then with their warbling pipes,
they wont to play upon,
Before their several flocks of shee^
together as they gone.
Do chaunt it now aloft
with sound of shepherds lay,
And thus with joy solemnise they,
this blessed babes birthday.
The virgin so likewise,
that Jesus mother was,
Which first was brought into a mus^
how it might come to pass:
That she a child should bear,
and knew no man at all:
(...) now agnize the work of God.
and let her eye down fall
^n her little babe
which God to her had sent,
^e her savior, and of all
^ho ever do repent.
(...) then she took her babe,
and dandled it a while:
^ther while she gave it suck,
^is crying to beguile.
(...) many kiss it gave
(...) it lay in her arm:
(...) the^ with clothes, such as they were,
^elapt it well and warm.
(...) while the breast she gives,
^e quieter to keep:
^ther while she lulleth it,
^d husheth it asleep.
(...) thus in most sweet guise,
^d amiable sort:
(...) time they pass with mirth and joy,
^d many another sport.
The lost Sheep.
Since that the heaven of heavens
where God and angels be,
Is made the seat whereon I sit,
by mightyest power decree:
^d that the Earth beneath,
where herb and grass does grow,
^ere men and beasts and living things
do creep thereon and go:
^or my foot the stool,
ordained long before,
^r world was wrought, or angel made,
or ought else less or more.
^th I am Lord thereof,
and all these things be mine,
^en tell me man what moves thee,
from me thus to decline?
and seek other ways,
these things for to obtain:
(...) fond and frantike is thy wit,
so feeble is thy brain.
Which way thou car'st not how,
rather than come to me:
Being the well and fountain spring,
of all good things that be.
I also ready am,
on thee for to bestow,
Each good that is, if thou but ask,
I must my kindness show.
Such is my love to thee,
not changeable, but sure,
I loved thee before thou wast,
which love shall still endure.
When thou a sinner were,
and wickedness did use,
To give my blood and life for thee,
the same did not refuse.
Thou art now iustifide,
by shedding of my blood,
And reconciled by my death:
wherein thou art made good.
For I that knew not sin,
was yet made sin for thee:
That thou might be the righteousne^
of th'onlie God in me.
And I do thee assure,
it did me greatly please,
To bear thy sin and wickedness,
thy weakness and disease.
^ou but trust in me,
^d steadfastly believe:
^re shall no torment, pain, or smart,
^r any sin thee grieve.
(...) through my special grace,
and mercies great in store,
^omise thee I will henceforth,
^inke on thy sin no more.
(...) in the deep allow,
and bottom of the Sea,
^ue all thine iniquities,
^or ever thrown away.
^y do thou toil and moile,
and after shadows run?
^d shun'st the way that leads to me,
which am Gods only son?
(...) the giver sure,
^f true felicity:
^d yet for it be very few,
that seeks unto me.
^utie allureth much,
and rauisheth the mind:
^d draws unto it flocks of men,
that loving seem and kind.
^dlo, behold and view,
nothing more fair to see
^an I, and yet not one there is,
will be in love with me.
In honorable styles,
do many take delight,
And of ancient nobility,
do claim descents by right.
And yet nothing there is,
of ancient high degree,
In title, style, or chief descent,
that goes before me.
For while I am the son
of God most glorious,
And mother mine a virgin was,
and my name is Jesus.
Which name was given to me,
not unadvisedly:
Nor at adventure, and by chance,
as names are commonly.
Nor was it given by man,
but by an angel sent
To tell of my Nativity,
the purpose and intent.
And under heaven there is
none other name but this:
Given unto men their souls to save
from all their trespasses.
How happens it therefore,
that scarsely on the ground,
Can any one that willing is
to join with me be found.
^his society
which I so much desire:
(...) not for me, but for your good,
that I the same require.
(...) the Monarch cheese,
of heaven, of earth, and all,
^y then are you so loath and shamde,
to come when I you call?
^m most rich indeed,
and ready for to give
^th great and many benefits,
to all in says that live.
^reatly do desire,
and very feign would have
^titions made, that I might give,
to such as on me crave.
^t now alas behold,
not one that understands
^ow for to ask nor come to me,
to crave ought at my hands.
^m the wisdom called,
of God my father dear:
and so I am in very deed,
and yet for love ne fear,
^ill any mortal wight,
vouchsafe to seek me out,
^o ask me counsel of that thing
whereof he is in doubt,
I am the brightness great,
of fathers glory mine,
And of his heavenly majesty,
the image most divine.
And yet no man thereby,
of what estate or gree,
The more to honor moved is,
nor yet to reverence me.
I am a pleasant friend,
a trusty friend also,
To him that willing is to be
my friend, and with me go.
I do bestow my wealth,
my riches and my store,
On them I love with willing mind,
what can be asked more?
And yet none goes about
to enter in with me:
To this sweet amiable league,
of friendships high degree.
I am the only way,
that unto heaven does lead,
And yet but very few there be,
that use my paths to tread.
Why do the ignorant
b^tred people blind,
Not trust in me, seeing I am
the only truth to find?
(...) then do thou refuse,
^y promise to believe:
^e is so saithfull as I am,
^d none may more thee grieve.
(...) sith I am of life
^e author, and of breath:
^t mean you then, by leaving me,
(...) follow after death.
(...) your only light,
(...) darkness is in me:
(...) yet will wilful foolish men,
(...) darkness rather be.
(...) the perfect rule
(...) living righteouslie,
(...) then do thou seek other forms,
(...) square thy life thereby?
^ely am alone,
^e pleasure sweet and true,
^hout all gall or bitterness,
^iected yet of you.
(...) the peace of mind,
and comforter likewise,
^ll afflicted consciences,
^hen stormy troubles rise.
^y then do not these men
that vexed be in mind,
^e unto me for their relief,
which they are sure to find?
If Lions wild and dumb,
themselves can thankful show
To such as any benefit
upon them did bestow.
Or if the Dragons fierce,
have grateful learned to be,
Or mastife curs their masters know
and fawn when they him see.
If Eagles love return
to such as keep them well:
And Dolphins likewise kindness (...)
as you your selves can tell:
If other beasts likewise,
depri'ud of reasons sense,
Can to their benefactors use
both love and reverence:
Why will thou then (o Man)
thy self set forth to be,
More brutish than the savage beast^
denying love to me?
Seeing that to thy use,
and only for thy sake,
All things that be, yea thou thy self
of nothing did I make.
And with my precious blood,
redeemed thee have I,
From sin, from death, from hell and p^
and that most willingly.
And if the ox does know,
his owner that him sed,
The ass likewise his masters crib,
that stands him in stead:
Why do not thou unkind,
and churlish man to me,
Acknowledge me to be the same,
that has redeemed thee?
am alone to thee,
all things that thou would have:
And I alone will furnish thee,
with all things thou can crave.
Why runnest thou about,
gadding from place to place,
To seek elsewhere thy benesit,
distrusting of my grace:
Why busiest thou thy self,
in many needless ways,
And do frequent the company,
of skornefull wicked straies?
As I am merciful,
so easy to entreat:
Thou wretched man seek unto me,
despair not though I threat.
Yea since I am the just
revenger of thy sin:
Why therefore art thou not afraid,
me to offend therein?
I can even with a beck,
cast down thy soul to hell,
And yet my judgments searest not,
nor all the thrents I tell.
Wherefore thou foolish man,
if thou so wilful be,
Headlong to run unto thy death,
by thy forsaking me:
Blame but thy selse therefore,
and blame not me at all,
For thou thy self the author art,
of thy decaie and fall.
For what can I do more?
seeing th'excessiue love,
That I thee bare with tender care,
can no whit thee remove.
O flintie hearted man,
with rockie stony breast:
Which cannot be with love reclaimed,
nor mercies mine expressed.
Nor will persuaded be,
with such an hope assured,
Of heavenly joys and riches great,
ready for thee procured:
Nor can awaked be,
with promises divine:
Not any whit be terrifide,
with severe sentence mine:
Nor be admonished,
with any shame of sin:
But rather so egregiously,
persevere stiii therein:
That thou do sar surmount,
the savage beasts in kind,
And do possess an iron heart,
more hard than steel to find.
What can pity prevail,
alas, in such a place,
In such a perverse froward heart,
becankred void of grace?
To save one against his will,
and rid him from distress,
Does neither stand with wisdoms law,
nor yet with righteousness.
The complaint of Old Age.
IN search of secret such,
as is beneath the sun: find)
Each thing by kind his course does
by natures skill to run.
We see the stricken dear,
has caught a bleeding wound:
And yet by eating of an herb,
becomes whole and sound.
The hound a hurt receives,
that greeueth him with pain
By only licking with his tongue,
himself does heal again.
And if he sickly be,
with inward grief or sore:
He eats grass himself to purge,
which does his health restore.
The merlings and wood doves,
the Partridges and Iayes:
Do purge their superfluity,
with only herb of Bays.
The Pigeon and the Hen,
the Turtle Dove also:
Themselves does cure with pellitor,
that on the wall does grow.
The wild and savage Bore,
by eating Cedria,
Do help themselves, and so do bears,
with herb Mandragora.
The loathsome Snake with age,
both feeble is and blind:
Who slowly slides from place to place,
some narrow straight to find,
Through which he strains himself,
thereby his skin to cast:
And so new health with strength and sight,
he purchases at last:
The Lizard in his age,
does change and cast his skin:
And sits open eyed against the East,
the sun may enter in:
The heat whereof does dry,
the humor of his eyes:
By which his sight again he takes,
in corner where he lies.
The Eagle being weak,
much grievous moan does make:
Because his bill is grown so long
he can no sust'nance take:
Yet nature has him taught,
some rock or stone to find,
Against the which his bill beats off,
and so gets health by kind.
When as the Pelican
behols her birds late slain:
(...) poison that the Serpent shed,
tormented is with pain.
and then does with her bill,
her tender breast berent:
and so her birds reuine again,
by blood upon them sprent.
^he Lapwing being old,
to see nor fly she may,
^ntill her birds such feathers pluck
as causes her decaie:
and then with juice of herbs,
her eyes do rid from pain,
and hide her underneath their wings,
till she be whole again.
^he Swallow in like sort
perceiues her yonglings eyes
^o be deprived of their sight,
forth from the neast she flies,
and finds out an herb
that Celedoni hight,
and does return, and with the same
restores to them their sight,
^hus do we see and know,
that nature bears swaie,
(...) creatures such as reason wants,
to help them what she may.
But now to you my friends,
that Physic do profess:
Which by your skill and learning gre^
do many greefes redress.
And with the same we know,
you often bring to pass,
Sweet health again for to restore,
where dangerous sickness was.
Ofhealth to write the praise,
I wish he could that can:
Health is one of the goodlyest gifts,
that God has lent to man.
Health lists up the mind,
and makes the body light:
Health does bedew the face with blou^
that fresh is to the sight.
Health makes the sinews strong,
more travel to endure:
And health unto the man that is wise,
great comfort does procure.
What profit health does bring
to those that students be:
No tongue can tell, but such as suck,
the Nectar from the tree.
By health the husbandman
both tils and sowes the land:
Without the which no prince may say,
he able is to stand.
And every man besides,
that lives in common wealth,
As some by skill, and some by strength,
through power of noble health,
The same likewise supports,
in order as they ought:
And but for health all governments
to ruin come and naught.
If health be done away,
then life is worse than death,
For death makes end of sorrows all,
by stopping of the breath.
Of earthly treasures all,
health is to be preferred
Before all things that eye has seen,
or ear has ever heard.
A Question would I ask,
thereby not to offend:
What is the cause that physics art,
cannot old age defend?
By cunning and by skill,
great cures ye do each day:
But age will not removed be,
nor yet kept at a stay.
No physics art ne drug,
nor potion can ye make:
Can force old age for to exchange,
the place that he does take.
Age steals on us so,
yer ye can do us good:
That suddenly it quails the strength,
and does forestall the blood.
Whereby the humor fresh
is brought unto decay:
And gallant vigor of the mind,
is forced to fly away.
And look what lusty age,
in yoonger years brought forth,
The same old age has clean defaced,
and made it nothing worth.
A thousand maladies
upon old age depend:
Which peecemeale wise away do pluck^
what fragrant youth did send.
Beauty is worn away,
fresh blood is turned to black:
Wit is made dull, the memory lost,
and liveliness does lack.
Age makes our sleeps unsure,
our eiesight for to fail:
Our courage and actiuitie,
our strength and all to quail.
The vital heat is cold,
delights are driven to shore:
Nourishing juice and breathing sweet,
are gone for evermore.
All merriments and sports,
conceits, else what ye will:
and to be short, man from himself
age takes and wastes still.
^ge leaves unto man
only of man the name:
^r what man was in times forepast,
now nothing like the same.
^en tell me this I pray,
whether it may be called
^ld age: or rather living death,
that thus man's life has thrald?
O Who is he can tell
the thing that deals thus:
^at with such posting speed can steal,
our chiefest time from us?
^d that so hastily,
can taint our golden years:
^ith groaning greefes and great annoy,
provoking bitter tears?
that dealing may this be,
it is unequal sure,
^at flouring age so so one should end,
no longer to endure?
^d that before we know,
the goodness of the thing:
^ey ready are us to forsake,
by flight of speedy wing.
And sooner than we knew
or felt the life we crave:
We are forbidden by and by,
a longer life to have.
Yet beasts of sundry kinds,
and fowls aloft that fly,
Above two hundred years do live,
before that they do die.
The stag, the bucke, the Raven,
the Elephant also,
So long do live in lusty plight,
and healthfullie do show.
But man, alas poor man,
before that he may clime
To fifty years, his bodily strength,
does very much decline.
And if that he may reach
to threescore years or more:
His waining wit and memory
is weaker than before.
The Thebans held a law,
who threescore years did live:
If after that he then fell sick,
none might him physic give.
That age obtainde, say they,
himself ought not to bend,
Longer to live, but hasten forth,
unto his iournies end.
Experience does confirm,
and proves this too true:
That lately such as lusty were,
in valor, strength, and hue,
Are now through age become,
all crooked to behold:
Their heads with white bespeckled are,
their heat is turnde to cold.
The frost their beards has caught,
which makes them to think,
How that the spring of their green age,
is past and still does shrink.
OFlitting youth adieu,
age makes all things decline:
O too too short a fading flower,
of transitory time:
Which by no way nor art,
can be repaired again:
The winter cold the heat has nipt,
and ransackt every vain.
O green and sprouting years,
o gallant youth that is past:
What sweet and pleasant merry days,
were spent while you did last?
O happy time of life,
how slily does it pass:
And steals away making exchange
for purest gold but brass.
How closely is it gone,
and not perceived at all:
And glides away as do the streams,
which down a river fall?
More swift it may be said,
than empty clouds that fly
By force of winds that toss them roun^
in compass of the sky.
Like dreams that pass away,
within our sleeps we see:
When we awake nothing there is,
of that we dreamt to be.
The sweet and fragrant rose,
now delicate in sight:
Within short time all withered is,
and turned as day to night.
And so likewise of man,
from child to man does grow:
From man again a child becoms,
old age will have it so.
WHile that the little boy,
with top and scurge began plaie^
And while the stripling goes to school^
his grammar part to say.
While those of further years,
phylosophie do read,
And cull the bloomes of Rhetorike,
and figures finely spread.
While they themselves delight,
(...) in poets fables vain:
and while they range in arguments;
(...) which Logic can maintain.
^hile they the time imploie,
(...) to publish matters small:
though of no weight) by eloquence
(...) to show their skill withal.
^hile like the be they skip,
(...) from bloome to blossom blown:
and for their purpose suck the fruit,
(...) by sundry authors sown.
^hile they disposed so,
(...) by study to attain,
^e knowledge of the liberal arts,
(...) no labor do refrain.
^d while that without end,
(...) their troubled brains they beat,
(...) find out every faculty,
(...) grafted in science seat.
^ile they the Greek translate,
(...) in Latin for to go:
^d Latin into Greek likewise,
(...) their cunning forth to show.
^ile foreign toongs they seek,
(...) their knowledge to maintain:
^d fear not to transfret the seas,
(...) and Alps to clime with pain.
^ile they themselves acquaint,
with countries that be strange,
With forre^ courts, with things vnkn^
and other things of change.
While they thus busy be,
stifle age comes stealing in,
And lays his crutch upon their bac^
and does the maistrie win:
So much that they be driven,
to marvel and to muse:
How that their strength so suddenly,
should them fail or refuse.
And though the same they feel,
yet not persuaded are:
That lusty gallant youth of theirs,
should be remoou'd so far.
ALas why should we then,
so carefully appear:
As to consume our golden age,
with search of trifles here:
As pearls and gems of price,
of gold and silver pure:
Of scarlet, silk, and cloth of gold,
which may not long endure:
And wast fully consume,
and wilfully to spend
Our golden years in vanities,
and all to no good end?
Again, if that those things,
which transitory be:
^re lost or stolen or burnt with fire,
there is a mean we see.
^e same may be in time,
recovered again:
^hou as poor as Codrus were,
^or Irus did remain:
^t hope to be as rich,
^as Crassus heretofore:
(...) that thy substance and thy wealth,
may match with Croesus store.
^t as for creeping age,
when Clotho has begun:
^on her clew thy thread to wind,
that Lachesis had spun,
^n never be reuok't,
again to be vntwinde:
^no enchantment, charm, or force,
that wit of man can find.
NOt Circes with her charm,
nor Mercury with his rod:
^or yet Medea with her drugs,
can stay this work of God.
Jupiter himself,
thy belly full would fill,
^ith Nectar and Ambrosia,
which some of learned skill
^aue writ that by such things,
youth still they might maintain:
And banish old age in exile,
for ever to remain.
No, no, it will not be,
though that Aurora fair,
Would day by day thy body bath,
with deaw of heavenly air.
No, though ten thousand times,
sweet Venus for to please,
Thou pain thy self as Phao did,
to ferry Chyos seas.
No, though Chiron himself,
should unto thee apply,
All sovereign herbs that spring or (...)
on earth beneath the sky.
Nothing there is can stop,
the course of years that slide:
Nor keep them from our weary back
but must the same abide.
In deed of tales we read,
and fables have been told:
How Orpheus and Amphion,
with other poets old,
Have by their magic art,
made rivers still to stay:
And to return unto those springs,
backward another way.
Diana stopped her coach,
Phoebus his steeds so staid:
^ade his chariot still to stand,
(...) listen what they said.
(...) let these idle tales
(...) thought upon no more: (wroght
^f they could such things have
(...) (...) is said before:
(...) might they bring,
^e age thou once possessed,
keep thee in the age thou art,
^ile life is in thy breast.
(...) yet the sun goes down,
^d takes his beams away:
does arise most gloriously,
^e next ensuing day.
moon a waining has,
^t afterward a change:
(...) does receive her former light,
^d revolution strange.
^er grows young again,
(...) frostie cold once spent:
^er turned into a spring,
^at does us well content.
yet the state of age,
^at flits away so fast:
(...) when the summer time thereof,
(...) once consumed and past:
(...) that the winter sharp,
^th horie frost and cold:
(...) the head and withered face,
with snow has taken hold:
No hope is then at all,
for any spring to cry,
Nor yet for any Ver to come,
where root and stock is dry.
THere rests now but this,
of remedies the best:
Which is, that death those evils shall
and set the soul at rest.
We learn for to be wise,
too late when youth is gone:
And do begin to muse thereof,
when remedy is none.
We then bewail our life
in vanity misspent:
And do detest those wilful ways,
we did in youth frequent.
We curse that now in age,
which youth delighted in:
And that which then most sweet did^
is now most bitter sin.
The thoughts thereof torment
our guilty conscience sore,
With grief and pain we do lamen^
our youth abusde before.
And to our selves began say,
what treasure have we spilt:
And reapt thereby unto our selves,
(...) sorrow, death, and guilt?
life God knows is short,
^certaine of the same:
^inke on time so vainlie spent,
^ight make us blush with shame.
(...) sleep let us awake,
^d rise from sin at last,
(...) time it is for to repent,
^r former follies past.
youth has taken horse,
^d posteth day by day,
^ite and summon pale face death,
^th speed to come away.
^th is the true refuge,
^e only perfect health:
does deserve to be embrast,
^fore all worldly wealth.
^th is the thing most dear,
^e best thing to be had:
a thing that God has given,
^herewith to make us glad.
^an with his estate
^ntented is we see:
(...) those that lie asleep in grave,
^ey well contented be.
grave is a strong fort,
^herein our selves we shut,
(...) the assaults of yrkesome life,
^d broiles of Fortunes cut.
The dead we know do rest,
as in a haven of ease:
Where those that live do sail in^
of rough and raging seas.
Death is unto the evil,
a whip of smarting pain:
And to the good a sweet reward,
of everlasting gain.
THe common custom is,
to flatter them that live:
And of the dead reproachful words,
and ill reports to give.
But sure the fault is great,
to speak ill of the dead,
Who harm them not but quietly,
do rest within their bed.
As no man is so good,
but better might have been:
So no man lives that is so bad,
but worsser name might win.
For as there is some cause,
a man for to dispraise:
So in the same some virtue dwells
that his renown might raise.
And therefore of the dead,
I wish to speak the best:
And praise the virtues which they (...)
and let their vices rest.
^s our course direct,
^ile perfect mind we have:
set our compass toward Christ,
^o only must us save.
^im from henceforth now
^r only study be,
pleasant muse, our cheese delight,
^r joy and liberty.
^s not care at all,
^r worldly matters vain:
for the body, so the soul
^th Jesus Christ remain.
^e soul and body both,
^ll at the judgment day,
^ed be and sentence hear,
^ich Christ himself shall say.
^h grant o father dear,
(...) Christ his sake thy son,
^e unto our endless joy,
life that is to come.
Amen.
FINIS.
