The History of Cleomines and Juliet.
Lord Martial chief of Cretans Coast,
thus does he them erect:
To hono^rs stately Stage of truth,
and nothing does suspect.
That malli^^ was the ground and cause,
to bring unto ^^^ay?
Claudes^^^es, that constant Lord,
to Prin^e a (...) stay.
Such thought was far of from his mind,
he dearly did them love:
Which afterward, against his grace,
a misch^^^e great did move.
Amb^^ious minds were not content,
wi^h this estate no doubt:
But from the Prince the Diadem,
to r^aue they went about.
Aspyring minds, still toil to clyme,
to to^ of Honors stall:
But ^asty clyming often times,
does catch a sudden fall.
Yet ^^aue I them with Prince in Court,
as f^wning friends to stay:
And to Claudestines again,
in C^ll, I must my way.
Whose playntes surmounting seem to show,
his tears like Ryuers run:
And often he blames the froward fates,
that s^ his fyle have sp^nne.
They little mind Claudestines,
has notyce of their guyle:
They little think he is content,
to wander in exyle.
Amyntas he is occupied,
in glistering cups of G^lde:
And eke Argastulus does (...),
his Jewels to behold^*
The one is telling of his C^yne,
the other looks for shar^.
Thus moyling stands their merry mynds
as mates deuoyde of care.
But darkesome night Aurora (...),
to coutch in dimm^^ Den:
And ^itan vanntes in Ethrall clo^des,
whose glimmering beams as th^n
Commaundes them rise, from stately bed,
and Sophor sweet to shoon:
And much they bless the Gods about,
that dawning day is won.
Then up from bed, to Prince the^ ^ace,
and humbly him salute:
And as his friends, Cleomines
the King does them repute.
And gives Amyntas Knight the place,
and Office as his right,
Of Stewardship, and did create,
Argastulus false Knight.
