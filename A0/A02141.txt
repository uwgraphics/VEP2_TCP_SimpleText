THE SECOND PART of Connie-catching.


TO ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN, merchants, citizens, apprentices, yeomen, and plain
country farmers, Health.
WHen Sceuola, Gentlemen, saw his native city besieged by Porsenna, and that
Rome the mistress of the world was ready to be maistred by a professed foe to
the public estate: he entered boldly into the enemies camp, and in the Tent
of the king (taking him for the king) slew the kings Secretary, whereupon
condemned, brought to the fire, he thrust his right hand into the flame burning
it off voluntary, because it was so infortunat to miss the fatal stab he had
intended to his countries enemies, and then with an honorable resolution,
breathd out this. Mallem non esse qua^ non prodesse patriae. This insta^ce of
Sceuola greatly has emboldened me to think no pains nor danger too great
that grows to the benefit of my country, and though I cannot as he mannadge
with my courtlax, nor attempt to vnleager Porsenna: yet with my pen I will
endeavor to display the nature and secrets of diverse coosenages more
prejudicial to England then the invasion of Porsenna was to Rome. For when
that valiant king saw the resolution of Sceuola: as one dismayed at the honor
of his thoughts, he sorrowed so brave a man had so desperately lost his hand,
and thereupon grew friends with the Romans. But gentlemen these
Conny-catchers, these vultures, these fatal Harpies, that putrify with their
infections, this flourishing estate of England, as if they had their
consciences sealed with a hot iron, and that as men delivered up into a
reprobate sense, grace ^ere utterly exild from their hearts, so with the deaf
Adder they not only stop their ears against the voice of the charmer, but
dissolutely without any spark of remorse stand upon their brauados, and openly
in words and actions maintain their palpa^le and manifest coosenages, swearing
by no less then their enemies blood, eue^ by God him self, that they will
make a massacre of his bones, and cut off my right hand for penning down their
abominable practices: but alas for the^ poor snakes, words are wind, and
looks but glances: every thunderclap has not a bolt, nor every Conny-catchers
oath an ^xecution. I live still, and I live to display their villainies, which,
gentlemen you shall see set down in most ample manner in this small treatise, but
here by the way, give me leave to answer an objection, that some inferred
against me, which was, that I showed no eloquent phrases, nor fine figurative
conueiance in my first book as I had done in other of my works, to which I
reply that (...) a certain decorum is to be kept in every thing, and not to
apply a high style in a base subject beside the faculty is so odious, and the
men so servile and slavish minded, that I should dishonor that high mystery of
eloquence, and derogate from the dignity of our English toonge, either to
employ any figure or bestow one choice English word upon such disdained
rakehels as those Conny-catchers. Therefore humbly I crave pardon, and desire I
may write basely of such base wretches, who live only to live dishonestly. For
they seek the spoil and ruin of all, and like droanes eat away what others
labor for. I have set down diverse other laws untouched in the first, as their
Vincents law, a notable coosenage at bowls, when certain idle companions stand
and make bettes, being compacted with the bowlers, who look like honest minded
citizens, either to win or loose, as their watch-worde shall appoint, then the
Prigger or Horsestealer, with all his ginnes belonging to his trade, and their
subtle cawtels to amend the statute, next the curbing law, which some call but
too basely hookers, who either diue in at windows, or else with a hook, which
they call a curb do fetch out whatsoever, either apparel, linen, or woollen,
that be left abroad. Beside I can set down the subtlety of the black Art,
which is picking of locks, a coosenage as prejudicial as any of the rest, and
the nature of the Lift, which is he that steals any parcels, and stily takes
them away. This (Gentlemen) have I searched out for your commodities, that I
might lay open to the world, the villainy of these coosening caterpillars, who
are not only abhorred of men, but hated of God, living idly to themselves,
and odiously to the world, they be those foolish children that Solomon speaks
of, that feeds themselves fat with iniquity, those untamed heifers, that
will not break the yoke of labor, but get their liuinges by the painful
thrift of other men's hands. I cannot better compare them, then unto Vipers, who
while they live are hated and shunned of all men as most prejudicial
creatures, they feed upon hemlocke and Aconiton, and such fatal and impoisoned
herbs, but the learned apothecaries takes them, cuts off their heads, and
after they be imbowelled of their flesh, they make the most precious
Mithridate: so these Conny-catchers, Foists, Nips, Priggars, and Lifts, while
they live are most improfitable members of the commonwealth: they glut
themselves as Vipers upon the most loathsome, and detestable sins, seeking
after folly with greediness, never doing any thing that is good, till they be
trust up at Tiburn: and then is a most wholesome Mithridate made ofthe^, for by
their deaths others are forewarned for falling into the like enormities. And as
the Gangrena is a disease incurable by the censure of the Chirurgians, unless
the member where it is fixed be cut off: so this untoward generation of loose
Libertines, can by no wholesome counsels, nor advised persuasions be dissuaded
from their lothsom kind of life, till by death they be fatally, and finally cut
off from the commonwealth, whereof spoke Ovid well in his Metamorphosis.
Immedicabile vulnus,
Ense resecandum est ne pars sincera trahatur.


Since then this cursed crew, these Machauilians, that neither care for God nor
devil, but set with the Epicures gain, and ease, their summum bonum cannot be
called to any honest course of living: if the honorable and worshipful of
this land look into their lives, and cut off such vpstarting suckars that
consume the sap from the root of the Tree: they shall neither loose their
reward in heaven, nor pass over any day wherein there will not be many
faithful prayers of the poor, exhibited for their prosperous success and
welfare: so deeply are these monstrous cooseners hated in the commonwealth.
Thus Gentlemen I have discovered in brief, what I mean to prosecute at large:
though not eloquently, yet so effectually, that if you be not altogether
careleffe, it may redownd to your commodity: forewarned, forearmed: burnt
children dread the fire, and such as neither counsel, nor other men's harms
may make to beware, are worthy to live long, and still by the loss. But
hoping these secrets I have set abroach, and my labors I have taken in
searching out those base villainies, shall not be only taken with thanks, but
applied with care: I take my leave with this farewell. God either confound, or
conuerr such base minded Cooseners.

Yours R. G.

THE SECOND PART of Conny-catching.


The discovery of the Prigging Law or nature of horse stealing.
TO the effecting of this base villainy of Prigging or horse stealing, there must
of necessity be two at the least, and that is the Priggar and the Martar. The
Priggar is he that steals the horse, and the Martar is he that receives him,
and chops and changes him away in any Fair, Mart, or other place where any
good vent for horses is: and their method is thus. The Priggar if he be a
Lance man, that is, one that is already horst, then he has more followers
with him, and they ride like Gentlemen, and commonly in the form of Drouers,
and so coming into pasture grounds or enclosures, as if they meant to survey
for Cattle, do take an especial and perfect view where Prankers or horses be,
that are of worth, and whether they be trameld or no that is whether they have
horselocks or no, then lie they houering about till fit opportunity serve, and
in the night they take him or them away, and are skillful in the black Art,
for picking open the tramels or sockes, and so make have til they be out of
those quarters. Now if the Priggars steal a horse in Yorkshire, commonly they
have vent for him in Surrey, Kent, or Sussex, and their Martars that receive
them at his hand, chops them away in some blind Faires after they have kept
them a month or two, till the hue and cry be ceast and past over. Now if their
horse be of any great valor and sore sought after, and so branded or ear
marked, that they can hardly sell him without extreme danger, either they
brand him with a cross brand upon the former, or take away his ear mark, and
so keep him at hard meat til he be hole, or else sell him in Cornwall or Wales,
if he be in Cumberland, Lincolnshire, Northfolke or Suffolk, but this is if
the horse be of great valor and worthy the keeping: Marry if he be only
colored and without brands, they will straight spotte him by sundry policies,
and in a black horse, mark saddle spots, or star him in the forehead and
change his tail, which secrets Iomit least I should give too great a light
to other to practice such lewd villainies. But again to our Lance men
Priggars, who as before I said, cry with the Lapwing farthest from their nest
and from their place of residence, where there most abode is, furthest from
thence they steal their horses, and then in another quarter as far of they
make sale of them by the Martars means, without it be some base Priggar that
steals of mere necessity, and beside is a Trailer. The Trailer is one that
goes on foot, but meanly attired like some plain gran of the Country,
walking in a pair of boots without spurs, or else without boots, having a
long staff on his neck, and a black buckram bag at his back, like some
poor Client that had some writing in it, and there he has his saddle, bridle
and spurs, stirhops and stirhop leathers, so quaintly and artificially made
that it may be put in the slop of a man's hose, for his saddle is made without
any tree, yet has both cantle and boulsters, only wrought artificially of
cloth and bombast, with foulds to wrap up in a short room, his stirhops are
made with vices and gins that one may put them in a pair of gloves, and so are
his spurs, and then a little white leather headstal and raines with a small
Scottish brake or snaffle, all so feately formde, that as I said before they may
be put in a buckram bag. Now this Trailer he bestrides the horse which he
priggeth, and saddles and bridles him as orderly as if he were his own, and
then carries him far from the place of his breed, and there sels him. Oh will
some man say, it is easier to steal a horse then to sell him, considering that
her Majesty and the honorable privy Counsel, has in the last Act of
Parliament made a strikt Statute for horse stealing, and the sale of horses,
whose Prouiso is this: That no man may buy a horse vntould, nor the toule be
taken without lawful witnesses, that the party that sells the horse is the
true owner of him, upon their oath and special knowledge, and that who buieth
a horse without this certificate or proof, shall be within the natue of
Felony, as well as the party that steals him. To this I answer that there
is no Act, Statute, nor Law so strickt conveyed, but there be straight found
starting holes to avoid it, as in this. The Priggar when he has stolen a
horse and has agreede with his Martar, or with any other his confederate, or
with any honest person to sell the horse, brings to the touler, which they
call the rifler two honest men either apparelled like citizens, or plain
country yeomen, and they not only affirm, but offer to depose, that they know
the horse to be his, upon their proper knowledge, although perhaps they never
saw man nor horse before, and these periurd knaurs be commonly old knights of
the post, that are soisted off from be ing taken for bale at the kings bench,
or other places, and seeing for open periuries they are refused, there they
take that course of life, and are wrongly called Querries, but it were
necessary and very much expedient for the commonwealth, that such base
roagues should be looked into, and be punished as well with the pillorie, as the
other with the halter. And thus have I revealed the nature of Priggars, or
horse-stealers briefly, which if it may profit, I have my desire, but that I
may recreate your minds with a pleasant history, mark the sequeale.

A pleasant story of a horse-stealer.
NOt far off from Tenro in Cornwall, a certain Priggar, a horse-stealer
being a lanceman, surueying the pastures thereaboutes, spied a fair black
horse without any white spot at all about him, the horse was so fair and
lusty, well proportioned, of a high crest, of a lusty countenance, well
buttockt, and strongly trust, which set the Priggars teeth a water to have him:
well he knew the hardest hap was but a halter, and therefore he ventered
fair, and stoll away the prancer: and seeing his stomach was so good as his
limbs, he kept him well, and by his policy seared him in the forehead, and
made him spotted in the back, as if he had been saddle bitten, and gave him a
mark in both ears, whereas he had but a mark in one. Dealing thus with his
horse, after a quarter of a year, that all hurly burly was past for the horse,
he came riding to Tenro to the market, and there offered him to be sold, the
Gentleman that lost the horse, was there present, and looking on him with other
Gentlemen, likte him passing well, and commended him: insomuch that he bet the
prise of him, bargained, and bought him: and so when he was told, and that the
horsestealer clap him good luck: Well my friend quoth the gentleman, I promise
thee I like the horse the better, in that once I lost one as like him as might
be, but that mine wanted these saddle spots, and this star in the forehead.
It may be so sir, said the Priggar, and so the Gentleman and he parted: the
next day after, he caused a letter to be made, and sent the Gentleman word that
he had his horse again that he lost, only he had given him a mark or two, and
for that he was well rewarded, having twenty mark for his labor. The
gentleman hearing how he was coosened by a horse-stealer, and not only robbed,
but mocked, let it pass till he might conveniently meet with him to revenge
it. It fortuned not long after, that this lanceman Priggar was brought to Tenro
Gayle for some such matter, and indeed it was about a Mare that he had stolen:
but as knaves have friends, especially when they are well monied, he found
diverse that spoke for him, and who said it was the first fault: and the party
plaintiff gave but slender evidence against him, so that the judge spoke
favorably in his behalf: the gentleman as then sat in the bench, and calling
to mind the Priggars countenance, how he had stolen his horse and mocked him,
remembered he had the letter in his pocket that he sent him, and therefore
rising up, spoke in his behalf, and highly commended the man, and desired the
judges for one fault he might not be cast away, and besides, may it please you
(quoth he) I had this morning a certificate of his honesty and good behavior
sent me, and with that he delivered them the letter, and the judge and the rest
of the bench smiled at this conceit, and asked the fellow if he never stoll a
horse from that Gentleman: no quoth the Priggar, I knew him not: your honors
mistakes me, said the gentleman he did but borrow a black horse of me, and
marked him with a stare in the forehead, and asked twenty mark of me for his
labor, and so discourst the whole matter: whereupon the quest went upon him,
and condemned him: and so the Priggar went to heaven in a string, as many of
his faculty had done before.

The Vincents law, with the discovery thereof.
THe Uincents Law is a common deceit or cosenage used in Bowling-allies
amongst the baser sort of people, that commonly haunt such lewd and unlawful
places: for although I will not discommend altogether the nature of bowling, if
the time, place, persons, and such necessary circumstaunces be observed: yet as
it is now used, practiced and suffered, it grows altogether to the maintenance
of unthrifts that idly and disorderly make that recreation a coosenage. Now
the manner and form of their devise is thus effected the Bawkers, for so are
the common haunters of the Alley termed, apparelled like very honest and
substantial citizens come to bowl, as though rather they did it for sport then
gains, and under that color of carelesnes, do shadow their pretended knavery:
well to bowls they go, and then there resort of all sorts of people to
behold them, some simple men brought in of purpose by some cosening companions
to be stripped of his crowns, others, Gentlemen or Merchants, that delighted
with the sport, stand there as beholders to pass away the time: amongst these
are certain old sokers, which are lookers on, and listen for bets either even
or odd, and these are called grypes: and these fellows will refuse no lay if
the ods may grow to their advantage, for the Gripes and the Baukers are
confederate, and their fortune at play ever sorts according as the Gripes have
placed their bets, for the Bawker he marketh how the lays goes, and so throes
his casting: so that note this, the bowlers cast ever booty, and does win or
loose as the bet of the Gripe does lead them, for suppose seven be up for
the game, and the one has three and the other none, then the vincent, for that
is the simple man that stands by and is not acquainted with their cosenage, nor
does so much as once imagine that the Bawkers that carry such a countenance of
honest substantial men, would by any means, or for any gains be persuaded to
play booty. Well this vincent, for so the Cooseners or Gripes please to term
him seeing three to none, begins to offer ods on that side that is fairest
to win: what ods says the gripe? three to one says the vincent, no says the
Gripe it is more, and with that they come to four for none, then the vincent
offers to lay four to one, I take six to one says the Gripe, I lay it says
the vincent, and so they make a bet of some six crowns, shillings, or pence as
the vincent is of ability to lay, and thus will sundry take their ods of him:
well then, the Bawkers' go forward with their bowls, and win another cast
which is five, then the vincent grows proud, and thinks both by the ods and
goodness of the play, that it is impossible for his side to loose, and therefore
takes and lais bets freely, then the Bawkers fortune begin to change, and
perhaps they come to three for five, and still as their luck changes, diversity
of bets grows on, til at last it comes to five and five, and then the Gripe
comes upon the vincent and offers him ods, which if the vincent take he loses
al, for upon what side the Gripe lays, that side ever winnes how great soever
the ods be at the first in the contrary part, so that the cosenage grows in
playing booty, for the Gripe and the Bawker meet at night, and there they
share what soever tearmage they have gotten, for so they call the money that
the poor vincent loses unto them: Now to shadow the matter the more, the
bawker that winnes and is aforehand with the game will lay franckely that he
shall win, and will bet hard and lay great ods, but with whom, either with them
which play with him that are as crafty knaves as himself, or else with the
Gripe, and this makes the poor vincent stoop to the blow, and to loose all
the money in his purse: Besides, if any honest men that holds themselves
skilful in bowling, offer to play any set match against these common bawkers,
if they fear to have the worse or suspect the others play to be better then
theirs, then they have a trick in watering of the alley to give such a
moisture to the bank, that he that offers to strike a bowl with a shore,
shall never hit it whilst he lives, because the moisture of the bank hinders the
proportion of his aiming. Diverse other practices there are in bowling te^ding
unto coosenage, but the greatest is booty, and therefore would I wish al men
that are careful of their coin, to beware of such coseners, and non to come
in such places, where a haunt of such hel-rakers are resident, and not in any
wise to stoop to their bets, least he be made a vincent, for so manifest and
palpable is their cosenage, that I have seen men ston-blind offer to lay bets
franckly, although they can see a bowl come no more then a post, but only
hearing who plays, and how the old Gripes make their lays: seeing then as
the game is abused to a deceit, that is made for an honest recreation, let this
little be a caveat for men to have an insight into their knavery.

THE SECOND PART of Conie-chatching.


THe professors of this Law, being somewhat dashed, and their trade grcatlie
impouerished by the late editions of their secret villainies, seek not a new
means of life, but a new method how to fetch in their Connies and to play
their pranckes: for as grievous is it for them to let slip a Country farmer
come to the term that is well apparelled, and in a dirtie pair of boots (for
that is a token of his new coming up, and a full purse) as it was for the
boys of Athens to let Diogenes pass by without a hiss. But the country men
having had partly a caveat for their coosenage, fear their favorable speeches
and their courteous salutations, as deadly as the Greeks did the whistle of
Poliphemus. The Conie-catcher now no sooner comes in company, and calls for
a pair of cards, but straight the poor Conie smokes him, and says: masters,
I bought a book of late for a groate that warnes me of Card-play, least I fall
amongst Conie-catchers: What, do thou take us for such, says the Uerser? no
Gentlemen says the cony, you may be men of honest disposition, but yet pardon
me, I have forsworn cards ever since I read it: at this reply God wot, I have
many a cosening curse at these Connie-catchers hands, but I solcmpnly stick
to the old proverb: the Fox the more he is cursed, the better he fares: but
yet I will discover some of their newest devises, for these caterpillars
resemble the nature of the Sirens, who sitting with their watching eyes upon
the rocks to allure Seapassengers to their extreme prejudice, sound out most
heavenly melody in such pleasing cords, that who so listens to their harmony,
lends his ear unto his own bane and ruin: but if any wary Ulisses pass by
and stop his ears against their inchauntments, then have they most delightful
jewels to show him, as glorious obiectes to inueagle his eye with such
pleasant vanities, that coming more nie to behold them, they may dash their
ship against a rock and so utterly perish. So these Conie-catchers, for that
I smoakt them in my last book, and laid open their plots and policies, where
with they drew poor Connies into their haie, seeking with the Orators
Beneuolentiam captare, and as they use rethoricall tropes and figures, the
better to draw their hearers with the delight of variety: so these moathes of
the Commonwealth, apply their wits to wrap in wealthy farmers with strange
and uncouth conceits. Iush, it was so easy for the Setter to take up a Connie
before I discovered the cosenage that one stigmaticall shameless companion
amongst the rest, would in a bravery were parsley in his hat, and said he
wanted but Aqua vitae to take a Connie with but since he has looked on his
feet, and valed his plumes with the Peacocke, and swears by all the shoes in
his shop, I shall be the next man be means to kill, for spoiling of his
occupation: but I laugh at his brauadoes, and though he speaks with his Enuches
voice, and wears a long sword like a morris pike, were it not I think he
would with Batillus hang himself at my inuectiue, his name should be set
down with the nature of his follies: but let him call himself home from this
course of life and this cosenage, and I shall be content to shadow what he is
with pardon, but from this degression again to the double diligence of these
Connie-catchers, whose new sleights, because you shall the more easily
perceive, I will tell you a story pleasant and worth the noting.

A pleasant tale of the Connie-chatchers.
NOt long since, certain Exceter merchants came up to London to traffic such
wares as their City commodities affoords, and one of them whose name I
conceal called master F. having leisure at will, walked about the City to
visit his friends, and by chance met with two or three conny-catchers?
amongst whom was one of his old and familiar acquaintance. This gentleman at
that time taking the Setters office upon him seeing such a fat Connie so fit
for his purpose began to pitch his haie with this courteous and clawing
gratulation. What master F. (quoth he) welcome to London, and well are you
met; I see time may draw friends together, little did I think to have seen
you here, but since opportunity has granted me such a favor to meet with
such an unlooked for ^an, well at the next Tavern drink a pint of wine
together, to your welcome, and the health of our friends. The Merchant hearing
the gentleman ply him with such plausible entertainment: stoopt as a poor
Connie, and granted to take his courtesy, and with them went the Uerser, a
lusty fellow, well apparelled, and as smooth toonged as if every word came
out of an Orators inckhorne: this jolly squire that played the Uerser, when he
came at the Tavern door, would needs drop away, and offered to be gone*: but
the Setter said to him, nay I pray you sir stay, and drink with this friend of
mine, for I have not a more familiar acquaintance in Exeter: The Merchant
simply also entreated him, and with few words he was satisfied, and as three
of them went in together, and asked for a rounie, the boy showed them up into a
chamber, and as soon as they came to the Uerser, having a pair of Cards in
his pocket, for they thought it too suspicious to call for a pair, stepped to
the window, and clapped his hand on the ledge, and laughed, ^ogs wounds (quoth he)
a man can neither come into Tavern, nor Alehouse, but he shall find a pair of
Cards in the window: Here has been some praying, and have left their books
behind them. Boy (quoth he) throw me a couple of fagots on the fire, and set a
pottle of Secke too, and burn it, and sir he says to the Setter, thou and I
will play at Cards who shall pay for it. Content says the Setter, so you will
play at a game that I can play at, which is called Mum-chance. I know it
well, says the Uerser: have with you for a pottle of burnt Secke, and so to it
they go, as before in my first part I describe it unto you: the poor Merchant
the simple honest Connie, calling the Card* well the Uerser lost, and at last
they reveal the policy to the Conny, who wondered at the strange devise, and
solemnly swore it was impossible for him either to loose, or the other to
win: As thus they sat drinking the Setter showed him diverse tricks at
Cards, to pass away the time, because their Barnacle stayed over long, who at
last, attiered like a Seruing-man, came and thrust open the door, and said,
masters by your leave, I look for a greyhound that has broken my slip, and
is run into this house. In faith friend, quoth the Setter, here is none, nor
did we see any: Then by your leave gentlemen (quoth he) and sit you merry, I
had rather have given forty shillinges then have lost the dog: Nay stay sir
(quoth the Uerser) and drink a cup of Secke with us: at that the Barnacle came
in, and courteously took it of them, and made sore lament for his dog,
saying, he durst scarce look his master in the face: but I hope (quoth he) he
is run to the farmers house, where he was brought up, and therefore I Will seek
him no where to day, with that he called for a pint of wine, to requite their
courtesies withal, and the Uerser answered that they would take none of him as
a gift, but if he would play for a pint or a quart he should be welcome into
their company: at this he sat down, and said he would, then they induced
him to play at mum-ch^nce, and the Conny called the Card, so the Barnacle lost
all, who being in a great chafe, cursed his luck, and the Cards, and offered to
play three games, xii. pence: the Setter took him up, and secretly asked the
Cony if he would be his half, or play with him himself. In faith says the
merchant, I dare play with him, as long as five shillinges last, and so much I
will venture: with that the Barnacle drew out a purse with some three or four
pence in it, and to this game they go, with vie and reuie till the Barnacle had
lost all his money, then he blasphemed the name of God mightily, and laid his
sword and his cloak to pawn to the good man of the house, and borrowed money
of it, to the value of some xx. shillings. The Conny smiled at this for he
counted all his own, and winkt upon the Uerser, and the Setter, again they go
to it, and they make five games for ten shillinges, and every Card to be vied
at the loosers pleasure, the Conny won three of them, and the Barnacle never
a one: then he exclaimed against Fortune, and swore he would make short
work, and of a ring he borrowed thirty shillings more, and vied hard: well
that game he won, and got so me twenty shillinges of the Conny, who thought
it was but a chance, that could not hit in seven years again, and the next
game they vied, and laid some five pound by on the belt, so that the v^e and
call, came to some seven pound, then the Barnacle stroke in his chopped Card, and
wipe the Connies mouth clean for trobling his purse, with any of those crowns,
yea he so handled ye poor merchant, that of nine pound he had in his purse,
these three base Conny-catchers left him never a penny, although he was sore
nipt on the head, with this hard Fortune, yet he brookt it with patience, and
little suspected that his Country man the Setter had sifted him out of his
money, and therefore druncke to him friendly, and took his leave without
smoking them at all, and went quiet though discontent to his lodging. The
Conny-catchers they shard the purchase, and went singing home as winners do
that have leave and leisure to laugh at the spoil of such wealthy and honest
merchants. Not long after this, the cony chanced to come to my chamber to visit
me for old acquaintance, where he found a book of Cony-catching new come out of
the press which when he had smilde at, for the strangeness of the title: at
last he began to read it, and there saw how simply he was made a conny, and
stripped of his crowns: with that he fetched a great sigh, and said: sir, if I
had seen this book but two days since, it had saved me nine pound in my
purse, and then he rehearst the whole discourse, how kindly he was made a
conny. Thus you may see that these base conny-catchers spare not their own
acquaintance nor familiar friends: but like Uultures seek to pray upon them,
and like the Harpie, infectes that house wherein they harbor: so odious is
their base and detestable kind of coosenage, that the very Nips, the cut-purses
I mean, desire to smoke them, and have them in as great contempt, as they
themselves are despised of others: holding the conny-catcher for their
inferior: for say the Nips I disdain to use my occupation against any friend,
or so draw a purse from him that I am familiarly acquainted with: whereas the
conny-catcher prays most upon his countrymen and friends, and at the first
hand comes with a smiling face to embrace that man, whom presently he means
to spoil and coosen. Again, the Nip uses his knife, and if he see a Boung
lie fair, strikes the stroke, and venters his neck for it if he be taken,
which is a certain point (say they) of resolution, though in the basest
degree: but the conny-catcher, like a coward keeps himself within compass of
law, as the picture of a faint hearted coosener: like a fawning curre wagges
his tail upon him, he means most deadly to bite. then let this be a caveat
for all men, and all degrees to take heed of such prejudicial pesants: who
like worms in a nut eat the kernel, wherein they are bred, and are so
venomous minded, that like the Uiper they desparage whomsoever they light on: I
know I shall have many braues uttered against me for this inuectiue: but so I
may profit my countrymen I will hazard my self against their deepest
villainies: and therefore sleeping never a whit the worse for their brauado, I
commit such enemies of the flourishing Estate of England, to the consideration
of the Justices who I hope will look into the loose life of bad, base, and
dishonest caterpillars.



A pleasant Tale of a Horse, how at Vxbridge, he coosened a Conny-catcher, and
had like to brought him to his Neckuerse.
IT fortuned that not long since certain Conny-catchers met by hap a Prancar
or horse steal at Uxbridge, who took up his inn where those honest cruel
lodged, and as one vice follows another, was as ready to have a cast at cards
as he had a hazard at a horse, the Conny-catchers who supt with him, feeling
him plia^t to receive the blow, began to lay the plot how they might make him
stoop all the money in his purse, and so for a pint of wine drew him in at
cards, by degrees as these rakehels do, Lento gradu, measure all things by
minutes, he fell from wine to money, and from pence to pounds, that he was
stripped of all that ever he had, as well Crowns, apparel, as Jewels, that at
last to maintain the main and to check v^es with reuies he laid his horse in
the hazard and lost him, when the Priggar had smoakt the game, and perceived he
was bitten of all the bite in his bung, and turned to walk penylesse in M^rke
lane, as the old proverb is, he began to chase, and to swear, and to rap out
goggs Nownes, and his pronouns, while at voluntarye he had sworn through the
eight parts of speech in the Accidence, auowing they had coosened him both of
his money and horse. Whereupon the gross Ass more hardy then wise,
understanding the Conny-catchers were gone, went to the Constable and made hue
and cry after them, saying: They had robde him of his horse, at this the head
Boroughs followed amain, and by chance met with an other hue and cry that
came for him that had stolen, which hue and cry was served upon the horse
stealer, and at that time as far as I can either conjecture or calculate, the
Conny-catchers were taken suspicious for the same horse, and the rather for
that they were found loose livers and could yield no honest method or means
of their maintenance, upon this for the horse they were apprehended, and bound
over to the Sessions at Westminster, to answer what might be objected against
them in her maiasties behalf. Well the horse stealer brake from his keepers and
got away, but the rest of the rascal crew; the Conny-catchers I mean, were
brought to the place of judgment, and there like valiant youths they thrust
twelve men into a corner, who found them guiltless for the fact, but if great
favor had not bin showen they had been condemned and burnt in the ears for
rogues. Thus the horse stealer made hue and cry after the Conny catchers, and
the man that had lost the horse he pursued the horse stealer, so that a double
hue and cry passed on both sides, but the Conycatchers had the worse, for what
they got in the bridle they lost in the saddle, what they coosened at cards
had like to cost them their necks at the Sessions, so that when they were free
and acquitted, one of the Conny-catchers in a merry vain, said, he had caught
many Connies, but now a horse had like to caught him, and so deeply quoth he,
that Miserere mei had like to have been my best mattins. Thus we may see
Fallere fallentem non est fraus, every deceit has his due, he that makes a
trap falls into the snare him self, and such as covet to coosen all, are
^rost them selves often times almost to the cross, and that is the next
neighbor to the gallows. Well Gentlemen thus I have bewraied much and gotten
little thanks, I mean of the dishonost sort, but I hope such as measure virtue
by her honors, will judge of me as I deserve Marry the good men
Conny-catchers, those base excrements of dishonesty, they in their huffes
report they have got one () I will not bewray his name, but a scholar they say
he is, to make an inuectiue against me, in that he is a favorer of those base
reprobates, but let them, him, and all know, the proudest peasant of them all,
dare not lift his plumes in disparagement of my credit, for if he do, I will
for revenge only appoint the Iakes farmers of London, who shall caze them in
their filthy vessels, and carrye them as dung to manure the barrain places of
Tibourne, and so for Conny-catchers an end.

A discourse, or rather discovery of the Nip and the Foist, laying open the
nature of the Cutpurse and Picke-pocket.


NOw Gentlemen, Merchants, Farmers, and termers, yea who soever he be, that
uses to carry money about him, let him attentively hear what a piece of new
fond Philosophy, I will lay open to you whose opinions, principles,
Aphorisms, if you carefully note and retain in memory, perhaps save some
crowns in your purse ere the year pass, and therefore thus: The Nip and the
foist, although their subject is one which they work on, that is, a well lined
purse, yet their manner is different, for the Nip uses his knife, and the
Foist his hand: the one cutting the purse, the other drawing the pocket: but of
these two scuruie trades, the Foist holds himself of the highest degree, and
therefore, they term themselves Gentlemen foists, and so much disdain to be
called cutpurses, as the honest man that lives by his hand or occupation, in so
much that the Foist refuses even to wear a knife about him to cut his meat
with all, least he might be suspected to grow into the nature of the Nippe, yet
as I said before is their subject and haunt both alike, for their gains lies
by all places of reso^t and assemblies, therefore their chief walks is Paul's,
Westminster, the Exchange, Plays, Bear garden, running at Tilt, the Lord
Majors day, any festiual meetings, fraies, shootings, or great faires: to be
short, where so ever there is any extraordinary resort of people, there the
Nippe and the Foist have fittest opportunity to show their iugling agillitie.
Commonly, when they spy a Farmer or Merchant, whom they suspect to be well
monied, they follow him hard until they see him draw his purse, then spying
in what place he puts it up, the stall or the shadows being with the Foist
or Nip, meets the man at some straight turn and iustles him so hard, that the
man marueling, and perhaps quarreling with him, the whilst the foist has his
purse and bids him farewell. In Paul's (especially in the term time)
between ten and eleven, then is their hours, and there they walk, and
perhaps, if there be great press, strike a stroke in the middle walk, but that
is upon some plain man that stands gazing about, having never seen the Church
before but their chiefest time is at divine service, when men devoutly given
do go up to hear either a sermon, or else the harmony of the Queere and the
Organes: their the Nip and the Foist as devoutly as if he were some zealous
parson, stands sob^rlie with his eyes elevated unto heaven when his hand is
either on the purse or in the pocket, surueing every corner of it for coin,
then when the service is done and the people press away, he thrusts amidst
the throng, and there works his villainy. So like wise in the markets, they
note how every one puts up his purse, and there either in a great press, or
while the party is cheayning of meat, the Foist is in their pocket and the Nip
has the purse by the strings, or some times ^uts out the bottom, for they
have still their stals following them, who thrusts and iustleth him or her
whom the Foist is about to draw* So likewise at plays, the Nip stands there
leaning like some manerly gentleman against the door as men go in, and there
finding talk with some of his companions* ^pieth what every man has in his
purse, and where, in what place, and in which sleene or pocket he puts the
voung, and according to that so he works either where the thrust is great
within, or else as they come out at the doors: but suppose that the first is
smoakt, and the man misseth his purs, and apprehends him for it then
straight, he either conuaieth it to his ^all, or else drodroppeth the boong, and
w^h a great brave he defieth his accuser: and though the purse be found at his
foot, yet because he has it not about him, he comes not within compass of
life. Thus have they their shifts for the law, and yet at last, so long the
pitcher goes to the brook that it comes broken home, and so long the Foists
put their villainy in practice, that westward they go, and there solemnly
make a rehearsal sermon at Tibourne. But again, to their places of resort,
Westminster I marie, that is their chiefest place that brings in their profit,
the Tearme-time is their harvest: and therefore, like provident husbandmen
they take time while time serves, and make hay while the Sun shines,
following their clients, for they are at the Hall very early and there they
work like bees, haunting every Court, as the Exchecquer chamber, the
Starrechamber, the King's Bench, the Common Pleas, an^ every place where the
poor Client stands to hear his Lawyer handle his matter, for alas the
poor Country Gentleman or Farmer is so busied with his causes, and has his
mind so full of cares to see his counsel and to plie his Atorney, that the
least thing in his thought is his purse: but the Eagleeied Foist or Nip he
watches, and seeng the Client draw his purse to pay some charges or fees
necessary for the Court, marketh where he puts it, and then when he
thrusts into the throng, either to answer for himself, or to stand by his
Counselor to put him in mind of his cause, the Foist draws his pocket and
leaves the poor client pennilesse. This do they in all courts, and go
disguised like Seruingmen, wringing the simple people by this iugling subtelie,
well might therefore the honorable and worshipful of those courts do to take
order from such vilde and base minded cutpurses, that as the law has
provided death for them if they be taken, so they might be rooted out
especially from Westminster where the poor clients are undone by such rogish
catchers. It boots not to tell their course at every remove of her Majesty
when the people flock together, nor at Bartholmew fair, on the Queens day, at
the Tilt-yard and at al other places of assembly: for let this suffice, at any
great press of people or meeting, there the Foist and the Nippe is in his
kingdom: Therefore let all men take this caveat, that when they walk abroad
amid any of the forenamed places or like assemblies, that they tak great care
for their purse how they place it, and not leave it careless in their pockets
or hoase, for the Foist is so nimble handed that he exceeds the iugler for
agility, and has his legier de maine as perfectly: therefore an exquisite Foist
must have three properties that a good Surgion should have, and that is an
Eagles eye, a Ladies hand, and a Lions heart, an Eagles eye to spy a purchase,
to have a quick insight where the boong lies, and then a Lions heart not to
fear what the end will be, and then a Ladies hand to be little and nimble,
the better to diue into the pocket. These are the perfect properties of a
Foist: but you must note that there be diversities of this kind of people, for
there be city Nips and country Nips, which haunt from fair to fair, and
never come in London, unless it be at Bartholmewe fair, or some other great
and extraordinary assemblies: Now there is a mortal hate between the
Country Foist and the City Foist, for if the city Foist spy one of the
connies in London, straight he seeks by some means to smoke him, and so the
Country Nip if he spy a City Nip in any fair, then he smoakes him
straight, and brings him in danger, if he flee not away the more speedily,
beside there be women Foists and women Nips, but the woman Foist is most
dangerous, for commonly there is some old hand, or snoutfair strumpet, who
inueigleth either some ignorant man or some young youth to folly, she has
straight her hand in his poket, and so foiste him of all that he has: but let
all men take heed of such common harlots, who either sit in the streets in
euenings, or else dwell in baudy houses and are pliant (...) every man's lure,
such are always Foists and Pickepockets, and seek the spoil of all such as
meddle with them, and in cosening of such base minded leachers as give
themselves to such lend company, are worthy of what so ever befalls, and
sometime they catch such a Spanish^ pip, that they have no more hair on their
head then on their nails. But leaving such strumpets to their souls confusion
and bodies correction in Bride-well: Again, to our Nips and Foists, who have a
kind of fraternity or brotherhood among them, having a hall or place of
meeting, where they confer of weighty matters, touching their worke-manship,
for they are provident in that, every one of them has some trusty friend
whom he calls his treasurer, and with him he lays up some ratable portion,
of every purse he draws, that when need requires, and he is brought in
danger, he may have money to make composition with the party: But of late,
there has been a great scourge fallen amongst them, for now if a purse be
drawn of any great value, straight the party makes friends to some one or
other of the Counsel or other inferior her Majesty's Justices, and then they
send out warraunts if they cannot learn who the Foist is, to the keepers of
Newgate that they take up all the Nips and Foists about the city, and let
them lie there while the money be reanswered unto the party, so that some pay
three pound, nay five pound at a time according as the same loss did amount
unto, which does greatly impouerishe their trade, and hinder their figging law.
Therefore about such causes grows their meeting, for they have a kind of
corporation, as having wardens of their company, and a hall: I remember their
hall was once about Bushops gate, near unto fishers folly, but because it was
a noted place, they have removed it to Kent-street, and as far as I can
learn, it is kept at one Laurence Pickeringes house, one that has been if he
be not still a notable Foist. A man of good calling he is, and well allied
brother in law to Bull the hangman, there keep they their feasts and weekly
meetinges, fit for their company. This have I partlye set down the nature of
the Foist, and the Nip, with their special haunts, as a caveat to al estates
to beware of such wicked persons, who are as prejudicial to the Commonwealth
as any other faculty what soever; and although they be by the great discretion
of the Judges and Justices daily trust up, yet still there springs up
young that grow in time to bear fruit fit for the gallows: let then every man
be as careful as possibly he may, and by this caveat take heed of his purs,
for the pray makes the thief, and there and end

A merry tale how a Miller had his purse cut in New gate market.
IT fortuned that a Nip and his staul drinking at the three Tuns in Newgate
market, sitting in one of the rooms next to the street, they might perceive
where a meal man stood selling of meal, and had a large bag by his side, where
by conjecture there was some store of money, the old Cool, the old cut purse I
mean, spying this, was delighted with the show of so glorious an object, for a
full purse is as pleasing to a Cut purse eye, as the curious Phisnomy of Venus
was to the amorons God of war, and entering to a merry vain as one that counted
that purchase his own, discovered it to the Nouice and bad him go and nip it,
the young toward scholar although perhaps he had stricken some few stroks
before, yet seeing no great press of people, and the meale-mans hand often
upon his bag, as if he had in times past smoakte some of their faculty, was
half afraid and doubted of his own experience and so refused to do it. Away
villain says the old Nippe, art thou fainte hearted, belonges it to our trade
to despair? If thou will only do common work, and not make experience of
some hard matters to attempt, thou will never be master of thine occupation,
therefore try thy wits and do it, at this the young stripling stalks me out
of the Tauern, and feeling if his Cuttle boung were glibbe and of a good edge,
went to this meale-man to enter combat hand to hand with his purse, but seeing
the mealemans eye was still abroad, and for want of other sport that he played
with his purse, he was afraid to trust either to his wit or Fortune, and
therefore went back again without any act athieued. How now says the old
Nip what have thou done, nothing quoth he, the knave is so wary, that it is un
possible to get any purchase there, for be stands plaing with his purse for
want of other exercise. At this his fellow looks out and smiles, making this
reply. And do thou count it impossible to have the meale-mans boung, lend me
thy knife for mine is left at home, and thou shall see me strike it straight,
and I will show thee a Method, how perhaps hereafter to do the like after my
example, and to make thee a good scholar, and therefore go with me and do as
I shall instruct thee, begin but a fained quarrel, and when I give thee a
watch word, then throw flower in my face, and if I miss his purse let me be
hanged for my labor, with that he gave him certain principles to observe, and
then paid for the wine and out they went together. As soon as they were come
to the meals-man, the old Nippe began to jest with the other about the Millers
sack, and the other replied as knauishlye, at last, the elder called the
younger Rogue, Rogue thou Swain, quoth he, do thou or dare thou
dishonor me with such a base title? And with that taking a whole hand full of
meal out of the sack, threw it full in the old Nippes neck and his breast,
and then ran away. He being thus dusted with meal, entreated the meal man
to wipe it out of his neck, and stoopte down his head, the meal man laughing
to see him so rayed and whited, was willing to shake off the meal, and the
whilst, while he was busy about that, the Nippe had stricken the purse and
done his feate, and both courteously thanked the meal man and closely went
away with his purchase. The poor man thinking little of this Cheat, began
again to play with his purse stringes, and suspected nothing till he had
soulde a pecke of meal, and offered to change money, and then he found his
purse bottomless, which struck such a cold quandary to his stomach, as if in
a frosty morning he had druncke a draught of small beer next his heart, he
began then to exclaim against such villains, and called to mind how in
shaking the dust out of the Gentleman's neck, he shakte his money out of his
purse, and so the poor meal man fetch a great sigh, knit up his sack and
went sorowing home.



A kind conceit of a Foist performed in Paul's.
WHile I was writing this discovery of foisting, and was desirous of any
intelligence that might be given me, a Gentleman a friend of mine, reported
unto me this pleasant tale, of a Foist, and as I well remember it grew to this
effect. There walked in the middle walk a plain country farmar a man of good
wealth, and that had a well lined purse, only barely thrust up in a round
slop which a crew of Foists having perceived, there hearts were set on fire to
have it, and every one had a fling at him but all in vain, for he kept his
hand close in his pocket, and his purse fast in his fist like a subtle churl,
that either had been forewarnd of Paul's, or else had before time smoakte some
of that faculty, well how so ever, it was impossible to do any good with him
he was so wary. The Foists spying this, strained their wits to the highest
string how to compass this boung, yet could not all their polliticke conceits
fetch the farmar over, for iustle him, that with him, offer to shake him by the
hand, all would not serve to get his hand out of his pocket. At last one of the
crew that for his skill might have bin Doctorat in his mystery, amongst them all
chose out a good Foist, one of a nimble hand and great agility, and said to the
rest thus: Masters it shall not be said such a base peasaunt shall slip away
from such a crew of Gentlemen Foistes as we are, and not have his purse
drawn, and therefore this time I Will play the staule my self, and if I hitte him
not home, count me for a bungler for ever, and so he left them and went to the
farmar and walked directly before him and next him three or four turns, at
last standing still he cried alas honest man help me, I am not well, and with
that suncke down suddenly in a sown, the poor Farmer seeing a proper young
gentleman (as he thought) fall dead before him, stepped to him, held him in his
arms, rubbed him and chafte him: at this there gathered a great multitude of
people about him, and the whilst the Foiste drew the Farmers pursse and away:
by that the other thought the feate was done, he began to come something to
himself again, and so half staggering, stumbled out of Poules, and went after
the true where they had appointed to meet, and there boasted of his wit and
experience. The Farmer little suspecting this villanye, thrust his hand into
his pocket and mist his pursse, searched for it, but lyning and shelles and all
was gone, which made the Country man in a great maze, that he stood still in a
dump so long, that a gen tleman perceiving it asked what he ayid: what aile I
sir quoth he, truly I am thinking how men may long as well as women, why do
thou conjecture that honest man quoth he? marry sir answers the Farmer, the
gentleman even now that sowned here I warrant him breeds his wines child, for
the cause of his sudden quaime that he fell down dead grew of longing: the
gentleman demanded how he knew that, well enough sir quoth he, and he has his
longing too, for the poor man longed for my pursse, and thanks be to God he
has it with him. At this all the hearers laughed, but not so merrilye as the
Foiste and his fellows, that then were sharing his money.

A quaint conceit of a Cutler and a cutpursse.
A Nippe having by fortune lost his Cuttle boung or having not one fit for his
purpose, went to a cunning Cutler to have a new made, and prescribed the
Cutler such a method and form to make his knife and the fashion to be so
strong, giving such a charge of the finenes of the temper and well setting of
the edge, that the Cutler wondered what the gentleman would do with it, yet
because he offered so largely for the making of it, the Cutler was silent and
made few questions only he appointed him the time to come for it, and that
was three days after: Well, the time being expired, the Gentleman Nip came,
and seeing his knife liked it passing well, and gave him his money with
advantage. The Cutler desirous to know to what use he would put it, said to
the Cutpurse thus, sir quoth he I have made many knives in my days, and yet I
never saw any of this form, fashion, temper or edge, and therefore if without
offense I pray you tell me how or to what will you use it? While thus he stood
talking with the Nippe, he spying the pursse in his aprone, had cut it passing
cunningly, and then having his purchase close in his hand, made answer, in
faith my friend to dissemble is a folly, it is to cut a pursse withal and I hope
to have good hansell, you are a merry gentleman quoth the Cutler, I tell true
said the Cutpursse and away he goes. No sooner was he gone from the stalle, but
there came an other and bought a knife and should have single money again, the
Cutler thinking to put his hand in his bag, thrust it quight through at the
bottom, all his money was gone, and the pursse cut, perceiving this and
remembering how the man praide he might have good hansell, he fetched a great
sigh and said, now I see he that makes a snare, first falls into it himself:
I made a knife to cut other men's pursses and mine is the first hansell, well
revenge is fallen upon me, but I hope the roape will fall upon him, and so he
smoothed up the matter to himself, least men should laugh at his strange
fortune.

The discovery of the Lifting Law.
THe Lift, is he that steals or prowleth any Plate, Iuells, boultes of
Satin, Ueluet, or such parcels from any place by a slight co^ueyance under his
cloak, or so secretly that it may not be espied: of Lifts there be diverse
kinds as their natures be different, some base roges that lift when they come
into Alehouses quart potts, platters, clokes, swords, or any such paltrie trash
which commonly is called pilfering or petulacerie, for under the color of
spending two or three pots of ale, they lift away any thing that comes
within the compass of their reach, having a fine and nimble agilitie of the
hand as the Foist had: these are the common and rascal sorts of Lifts, but
the higher degrees and gentlemen Lifts have to the performance of their faculty
three parties of necescitie the Lift, the Marker and the Santar: the Lift
attired in the form of a ciuell Country gentleman, comes with the Marker into
some Mercers shop, Haberdashers, Goldsmiths, or any such place where any
particular parcels of worth are to be conuaid, and there he calls to see a
boulte of Satin, Ueluet or any such commodity, and not liking the pyle,
culler or bracke, he calls for more, and the whiles he begins to resolve which
of them most fitly may be lifted, and what Garbage (for so he calls the goods
stolen) may be most easily couuaid, then he calls to the Mercers man and
says, sirrah reach me that piece of velvet or satte, or that Iuel, chain or
piece of Plate, and whilst the fellow turns his back, he commits his Garbage
to the Marker: for note, the Lift is without his cloak, in his dublet and hose
to avoid the more suspicion: the Marker which is the receiver of the Lifts
luggage, gives a wink to the Santar that walks before the window and then
the Santar going by in great have, the Marker calls him and says, sir a word
with you, I have a message to do unto you from a very friend of yours, and the
errand is of some importance, truly sir says the Santar I have very urgent
business in hand and as at this time I cannot stay, but one word and no more
says the Marker, and then he delivers him whatsoever the Lift has conuaide
unto him, and then the Santar goes his way, who never came within the shop, and
is a man vnknone to them all: suppose he is smoakte and his liftinge is looked
into, then are they upon their pantophles, because there is nothing sound about
them: they defy the world for their honesty, because they be as dishonest as
any in the world, and swear as God shall judge the^ they never saw the
parcel lost, but Oaths with them are like wind out of a bellows, which
being cool kindles fire: so their vows are without conscience and so they
call for revenge: Therefore let this be a caucat to all occupacions, sciences
and mis^eryes, that they beware of the gentleman Lift, and to have an eye to
such as cheapen their wares and not when they call to see new stuff to leave
the old behind them, for the fingers of Lifts are fourmed of Adamant, though
they touch not yet they have virtue attractiue to draw any pelf to them as
the Adamant does the Iron. But yet these Lifts have a subtle shift to blind
the world for this close kind of cosonage they have when they want money, one
of them apparelles him self like a Country Farmer, and with a Memorandu^
drawn in some legal form, comes to the chamber of some Counsayler or
Sargeant at Law with his Marker and his Santar, and there tells the Lawyer his
case and desires his Counsel, the whilst the Mar ker and the Santar lay the
platform for any Rapier, dagger, cloak, gown or any other parcel of worth
that is in the withdrawing or utter chamber, and as soon as they have they go
their way: then when the Lawyer has given his opinion of the case the Lift
requires, then he puts in some demurre or blind, and says he will have his
cause better discovered and then he will come to his worship again, so taking
his leave without his ten shillings fee, he goes his ways to share what his
companyons had gotten: the like method they use with Scriueners, for coming by
the shop and seeing any Garbage worth the lifting on, starteth in to have an
Obligation or Bill made in haste, and while the Scriuener is busy, the Lift
brings the Marker to the blow, and so the luggage is carried away. Now, these
Lifts have their special receivers of their stolen goods, which are two
sundry parties, either some notorious Bawdes in whose houses they lie, and
they keep commonly tapping houses and have young trugges in their house which
are consortes to these Lifts and love them so dear, that they never leave them
till they come to the gallows, or else they be Brokers, a kind of idle sort of
livers as pernicious as the Lift, for they receive at their hands whatsoever
Garbage is conuayed, be it linen, woollen, plate, Iuells, and this they do by a
bill of sail, making the bill in the name of John a Nokes or John a Styles, so
that they shadow the Lift and yet keep them selves without the danger of the
law. Thus are these Brokers and Bawdes as it were, efficient causes of the
Lifters villainy, for were it not their alluring speeches and their secret
consealings, the Lift for want of receivers should be feign to take a new
course of life, or else be continually driven into great extremes for selling
his Garbage, and thus much breefely for the nature of the Lift.

The discovery of the Courbing Law.
THe Courber, which the common people call the Hooker, is he that with a Curb
(as they term it) or hook, do pull out of a window any loose linen cloth,
appare^l or (...) other household stuff what soever, wh^ stolen parcells, they
in their Art call snappinges: to the performance of this law there be required,
only two p^sons, the Courber and the Warpe: the Courber h^ office is to spy
in the day time sit places where his trade may be practiced at night, and
coming to any window if it be open, then he has his purpose if shut, then
growing into the nature of the black Art, has his trickers, which are engines
of Iron so cunningly wrought, that he will cut a bar of Iron in two with then
so easilye, that scarcelye shall the standers by hear him: then when he has
the window open and spies any fat snappings worth the Curbing, then straight he
sets the Warp to watch, who has a long cloak to cover whatsoever he gets, then
does the other thrust in a long hook some nine foot in length (which he
calls a Curb) that has at the end a crook with three tynes turned contrary
so that it is impossible to miss if there be any snappinges abroad: Now this
long hook they call a Curb, and because you shall not wonder how they carry
it for being espied, know this that it is made with joints like an angle rod,
and can be conuaid into the form of a trunchion and worn in the hand like a
walking staff, until they come to their purpose and then they let it out at
the length and hook or curb what soever is loose and within the reach, and
then he conueyes it to the Warpe, and from thence (as they list) their
snappinges goes to the Broker or to the Bawd, and there they have as ready
money for it as Merchants have for their ware in the Exchange: beside, there
is a Dyuer which is in the very nature of the Courber, for as he puts in a
hook, so the other puts in at the window some little figging boy who plays
his part notably, and perhaps the youth is so well instructed that he is a
scholar in the black Art, and can pick a lock if it be not to cross
warded, and deliver to the Dyuer what snappinges he finds in the chamber. Thus
you hear what the Courber does and the Dyuer, and what inconvenience grows to
many by their base villanyes: therefore I do wish all men servants and maids,
to be careful for their Masters commodities, and to leave no loose ends
abroad, especially in chambers where windows open to the street, least the
Courber take them as snappinges, and conuaye them to the couseninge Broker.

Let this suffice, and now I will recreate your wits with a merry Tale or two.

Of a Courber, and how cu^ningly he was taken.
IT fortuned of late that a Courber and his Warpe went walking in the dead of
the night to spy out some window open for their purpose, and by chance same by
a Noble man's house about London and saw the window of the porters lodge open,
and looking in, spyed fat snappings and bad his Warpe watch carefully for
there would be purchase, and with that took his Courb and thrust it into the
chamber, and the Porter lying in his bed was a wake and saw all, and so was
his bedfellow that was yeoman of the wine seller, the Porter stole out of his
bed to mark what would be done, and the first snapping the Courber light on,
was his Liuerye coat, as he was drawing it to the window, the Porter easilye
lifted it off and so the Courber drew his hook in vain, the whilste his
bedfellow stole out of the chamber and raised vptwo or three more and went
about to take them, but still the rogue he plied his business and lighted on a
gown that he used to sit in in the Porters lodge, and warily drew it, but when
it came at the window, the Porter drew it off so lightly that the hooker
perceived it not: then when he saw his Courbe would take no hold, he swore and
chafte and told the Warp he had hold of two good snappes and yet mist them
both and that the fault was in his Courb, then he fell to sharping and
hammering of the hook to make it keep better hold, and in again he thrusts it
and lights upon a pair of buffe hose, but when he had drawn them to the
window the Porter took them off again, which made the Courber almost mad,
and swore he thought the devil was abroad to night he had such hard fortune:
nay says the yeeman of the seller, there is three abroad, and we are come to
setche you and your hooks to hell so they apprehended these base rogues and
carried them into the Porters lodge and made that their prison. In the morning
a crew of Gentlemen in the house, satte for Judges (in that they would not
trouble their Lord with such filthy Caterpillars) and by them they were found
guilty, and condemned to abide forty blows a piece with a bastinado, which
they had sollempnly paid, and so went away without any further damage.

Of the subtilty of a Curber in coosoning a Maid.
A Merrye jest and a subtle, was reported to me of a cunning Courber, who had
apparreld him self marvelous brave, like some good welfauoured young Gentleman,
and in stead of a man had his Warpe to wait upon him: this smoothe faced rogue
comes into More F^lds, and caused his man to carry a portell of Ipocras under
his cloak, and there had learnd out amongst others that was drying of clothes,
of a very well favored maid that was there with her Flaskit of linen, what
her Master was, where she dwelt, and what her name: having gotten this
intelligece, to this maid he goes, and courteously salutesher, and after some
prittye chatte, tells her how he saw her sundry times at her Masters door, and
was so besotted with her beauty, that he had made inquiry what her qualities
were, which by the neighbors he generally heard to be so virtuous, that his
desire was the more inflamed, and thereupon in sign of good will, and in
further acquaintance hhad brought her a pottle of Ipocras: the maid seeing him
a good proper man, took it very kindelye, and thankt him, and so they drunk
the Wine, and after a little Lovers prattle, for that time they parted.

The Maids heart was set on fire, that a Gentleman was become a suter unto her,
and she began to think better of her selle then ever she did before, and wered
so proud that her other suitors were counted too base for her, and there might
be none welcome but this new come gentleman her lover. Well, diverse times they
appointed meetings, that they grew very familiar, and he oftentimes would come
to her Mai^ters house, when all but she and her fellow maids were a bed so
that he and the Warpe his man did almost know every corner of the house: It
fortuned that so long he dallied, that at length he meant earnest, but not to
marrye the Maid whatsoever he had done else, and coming into the Feeldes to
her on a washing day, saw a mighty deal of fine Linen worth twenty pound
as he coniectured: whereupon he thought this night to set down his rest, and
therefore he was very pleasant with his Lover, and told her that that night
after her Master and Mistress were to bed he would come and bring a bottell of
Sack with him and drink with her: the maid glad at these news, promised to
sit up for him and so they parted: till about ten a clock at night, when he
came and brought his man with him, and one other Courber with his tools, who
should stand without the doors. To be breef, welcome he came, and so welcome
as a man might be to a maid: he that had more mind to spy the clothes, then
to look on her favor, at last perceived them in a Par lour that stood to the
street ward, and there would the maid have had him sit, no sweeting quoth he,
it is too near the street, we can neither laugh nor be merry but every one
that passes by must hear us: upon that they removed into another room, and
pleasaut they were, and tippled the Sack round, till all was out, and the
Gentleman swore that he would have another pottle, and so sent his man, who
told the other Courber that stood without, where the window was he should
work at, and away goes he for more Sack and bringes it very orderly, and
then to their cups they fall again, while the Courber without had not left
one ragge of Linen behind. Late it grew, and the morning began to war graye,
and away goes this Courber and his man, leaving the maid very pleasant with his
flattering promises until such time as poor soul she went into the Parlor,
and mist all her Masters Linen, then what a sorrowful heart she had, I refer
to them that have grieved at the like loss.

The Discovery of the Black Art.
THe Black Art is picking of Locks, and to this busy trade two persons are
required, the Charm and the Stand, the Charm is he that does the feate, and
the Stand is he that watches: There be more that belong to the burglary for
conuaying away the goods, but only two are imploide about the lock: the Charm
has many keys and wrests, which they call picklocks, and for every sundry
fashion they have a sundry term, but I am ignorant of their words of art, and
therefore I omit them, only this, they have such cunning in opening a Lock,
that they will undo the hardest Lock though never so weil warded. even while a
man may turn his back, some have their instruements from I take made of
steel, some are made here by Smiths, that are partakers in their villainous
occupations: but howsoever, well may it be called the black Art, for the Devil
cannot do b^tter then they in their faculty. I once save the experience of it
my self, for being in the Counter upon a commandment, there came in a famous
fellow in the black art, as strong in that qualitye as Sam^on: The partle now
is dead, and by fortune died in his bed, I bering that he was a charm began to
e^ter familiarity withhim, and to have an insight into his art, after some
acquaintance he told me much, and one day being in my Chamber I showed him my
Des^e, and as^t him if he could pick that little lock that was so well warded,
and too little as I thought for any of his ginnes. Why sir says he, I am so
experienced in the black Art, that if I do but blow upon a Lock ^t shall fly
open, and therefore let me come to your Deske, and do but turn five times
about, and you shall see my cunning, with that I did as he bad me, and ere I
had turned five times, his hand was r^fling in my Deske very orderlye, I
wondered at it, and thought verily that the Devil and his Dam was in his
fingers, much discommodity grows by this black Art in shops and noble men's
houses for their plate therefore are they most severely to be looked in to by
the honorable and worshipful of England, and to end this discourse as
pleasantly as the rest, I will rehearse you a true tale done by a most
worshipful Knight in Lancashire, against a Tinker that professed the Black Art.

A true and merry Tale of a Knight, and a Tinker that was a pick-locke.
NOt far off from Bolton in the Mores, there dwelled an ancient Knight, who
for courtesy and hospitallitie was famous in those parts: diverse of his
Tenuantes making repair to his house, offered diverse complaints to him how
their locks were picked in the night and diverse of them utterly undone by that
means, and who it should be they could not tell, only they suspected a Tinker
that went about the Country and in all places did spend very lauishlye: the
Knight willing, heard what they exhibited, and promised both redress and
revenge if he or they could learn out the man. It chanced not long after their
complaints, but this ioilye Tinker (so expert in the black art) came by the
house of this Knight, as the old gentleman was walking before the gate and
cried for work, the Knight ^raight coniecturing this should be that famous
rogue that did so much hurt to his Tennantes, called in and asked if they had any
work for the Tinker, the Cook answered there was three or four old Kettles
to mend, come in Tinker, so this fellow came in, laid down his budget and
fell to his work, a black Jack of beer for this Tinker says the Knight, I
know tinkers have dry souls: the Tinker he was pleasant and thankt him
humblye, the Knight sat down by him and fell a ransacking his budget, and
asked wherefore this tool served and wherefore that, the tinker told him all,
at last as he tumbled amongst his old brass the Knight spyed three or four
bunches of pick-lockes, he turned them over quickly as though he had not seen
them and said, well tinker I warrant thou art a passing cunning fellow and well
skild in thine occupacion by the store of tools thou have in thy budget: In
faith if it please your worship quoth he, I am thanks he to God my crafts
master: I, so much I perceive that thou art a passing cunning fellow quoth
the Knight, therefore let us have a fresh Jack of beer and that of the best
and strongest for the ^inker: thus he past away the time pleasantlye, and when
he had done his work he asked what he would have for his pains? but two
shillinges of your woorship quoth the Tinker, two shillinges says the Knight,
alas Tinker it is too little, for and see by thy tools thou art a passing
cunning workman, hold there is two shillinges come in sha^t drink a cup of
wine before thou go but I pra^ to^ tell me which way trauailest thou: faith
sir quoth the Tinker all is one to me; I am not much out of my way whersoeuer I
go, but now I am going to Lanca^er: I pray thee Tinker then quoth the K^ight
carry me a Letter to the Iaylor, for I sent in a fe^lon thither the other day
and I would send word to the Iaylor he should take no bale for him, marry that
I will in most dutiful manner quoth he and much more for your woorship then
that: give him a cup of wine quoth the Knight and sirrah (speaking to his
Clarke) make a Letter to the Iaylor, but then he whisperd to him and bad him
make a mittimus to send the Tinker to prison, the Clarke answered he knew not
his name, I Will make him tell it thee him self says the Knight and therefore
fall you to your pen: the Clarke began to write his mittimus, and the Knight
began to ask what Countryman he was where he dwelt and what was his name, the
Tinker told him all, and the Clarke set it in with this prouiso to the Iaylor
that he should keep him fast bolted or else he would break away. As Soon as
the mittimus was made, sealed and subscribed in form of a Letter, the Knight
took it and delivered it to the Tinker and said, give this to the chief Iaylor
of Lancaster and here is two shillings more for thy labor, so the Tincker took
the Letter and the money and with many a cap and knee thanked the old Knight
and departed: and made haste til he came at Lancaster, and staid not in the
town so much as to taste one cup of nappy ale, before he came at the Iailor,
and to him very briskly he delivered his letter, the ^ailor took it and read it
and smilde a good, and said tinker thou art wel^om for such a Knights sake, he
bids me give thee y^ best entertainment I may, I sir quoth the tincker the
Knight loves me well, but I pray you has ye courteous gentleman remembered such
a poor man as I? I marry does he tincker, and therofore sir quod. he to one
of his men, take the tinker in y^ lowest w^rd clap a strong pair of bolts on
his heels, and a basil of 28. pound weight, and then sir see if your pick
locks will serve the turn to bale you hence? at this the tinker was blank, but
yet he thouhgt the ^ailor had but iested, but when he heard the Mittimus, his
heart was cold, and had not a word to say his conscience accused, and there he
lay while the next sessions, and was hanged at Lancaster, and all his skill in
the black art could not serve him.

FINIS.
