Such as coueted to deck^ the Temple of Delphos, adorne^ the shryne either with

Music as Poetry.

To whom then should I rather dedicate this learned and religious book of
Devotion, writt^ by that rare and matchless Di^ine F: Ludouicus Granatensis,
^en to one devout in religion, ^d learned in knowledge? Rare ^call him; because
as Jacob (that ^ue pattern of simplicity and paynefull labor) who lived more
then 2000 years after the ^eation of the world, was the ^rst that made a vow
unto ^e Lord, vowing was then so ^re: so this Author almost ^000. years after
the re-creation ^f the world, is the first that Nec habuit ante eum, quem
imitaretur, nec post eum multi erunt, qui eum imitari velint.
^rit a particular Tractate of ^euotion. Matchless I call ^im, for as Jacob
was the first ^at vowed, so we do not ^ad in the Scriptures above ^o (so
seldom were vows ^ade) that followed him in ^owing; Iephte and Anna: so I do
^ot think, that we in this dearth ^f Devotion, and famine of Devout men, shall
have many imitaters of him in the like Argument. But that it may be say^ of him
for his Devotion, as i^ was said of Demosthenes for his eloquence, cui adhuc
pa^ nemo fuit, sed ne futurum quide^ aliquando quenquam arbitror.

Heavenly and exact I also term this work, both for the matter, and the
manner of handling it. The matter teaching how a soul may soar up to heaven,
and there be united to God, and for ever live in his presence, where is
fullness of joy, and plentye for evermore: And the manner so exactly and
methodically discoursing and discovering the whole matter, that unless a man
will be wilfully negligent and idle, and sit as a^ stone upon a stone, he
cannon but enter into the Theater o^ Gods house, and there medi^te on the
wonders of the Lord (...) his life long.

Joshua the Captain of the ^ordes host had four excell^nt qualities in him:
Religion, W^sedome, Valor and Industry. Which qualities in a Captain,
Uatablus, a man very learned (...) the antiquities of the He^wes, does decypher
by four ^eroglyphickes. The Hebrews ^re brought (says he) into Ca^an under
four standards or en^es, under every standard were ^ee battalians, according
to the ^elue tribes. The first standard ^s Rubens he carried in his en^e the
picture of an Angel, ^ich signified Wisdom. Judah ^ied in his ensign a Lion,
which ^ified Valor and Fortitude. E^aim carried a Bull, signifying ^ustry. And
Dan carried an Eagle signifying Religion, because the Eagle mounteth up to
heaven, (...) flies looking against the Sunn^ So this our spiritual Captain^
conducting men to the Celesti^ Canaan, teaches, that they the will deuote
themselves unto Go^ and become devout me^, must al^ have these four qualities
in the They must have Religion, becau^ they must consecrate their hea^ unto
God. And Wisdom, becau^ they must be as wise as Serpentes^ keep their
chiefest part from h^ that is, their heart from vain c^ gitations, and
inordinate affection They must have Valor and F^ titude to proceed and
perseue^ in their Devotion, and to wit^ stand impediments and tempt^ tions. And
it is also necessaryly r^ quired, that they be Industrio^ because without
pains Deuoti^ is not attained, for among all t^ ^ours of the religious (as
Aga^n was wont to say) there is no^ng more difficult then Deuo^.

To you I say (the kind enter^er of virtue, the mirror of a ^od mind) do I
dedicate this ^oke, unto whom I attribute (...) acknowledgements, of aboun^t
Schollership in the liberal ^ences, courteous well gouern^ behavior in
Gentleman like ^yage, and ripe experienst ^gement in the Laws of our ^d. It
very well appears, that (...) counsel of that witty Roman, (...) taken place
in you, who thus ^nselled the Roman youth. ^e bonas arts, moneo, Romana

And yet what is more com^dable among men, or more ^eptable with God, then that
^ry man should seek another wealth? In this declyning a^ tottering state of
the world (...) thinks I see again revived in yo^ the integrity of Papinianus,
t^ sincerity of (...), and the v^ right and just dealing of Phocio^ Aristides.
Of you I may say, Polidore Virgill said of Ioan^ Batmansonus, Iuuenis es in

modatus. Who with Mary h^ chosen the better part, and that o^ thing that is

and surely thus it comes to ^e, when as every Lawyer en^ureth to be as

when as all humane laws, ^tutions and ordinances, and ^soeuer else in the

MOST EXCELENT AND PROFIBLE BOOK OF DEVO^on, written by the Reverend Divine:
Fr. Jews of Granada.
WHAT DEVOtion is. CHAP. I.
^Euotion is a far other thing the^ many think: for many ^ose that it is a
certain ten^es and remorseful compassion ^ule and heart, which sometimes ^feele
that pray: or a conso^ and taste of spiritual things: but Devotion which now
we^ speak of, is (if we speak properly) neither of these. For carnalmen, and
such as are enthralle^ under sin, do often feel this ten dernes and sensible
comfort: an^ on the contrary part, holy an^ righteous me^ in their prayers, d^
many timestaste of none of these yet we must not say that the^ then have no
devotion, nor the the other have it, albeit they ha^ some smacke of it.

For this cause Thomas Aqui^ Secunda secundae q. 82. a. 2.
says, that Devotion is not prope^ ly a tenderness of heart, nor a spi^ tuall
consolation: but he sait^ that Devotion seems to be (...) other thing, then
a certain w^ lingnes and readiness in yeeldi^ to those things, that apperta^ to
the service of God. For D^ uotion is derived of vowin^ whereupon they are called
(...) ^ut, who after a certain man^r, do deuote and vow them^ues unto God,
that they may ^oly subject themselves under (...). This says he: therefore by
Who is a devout man
^e virtue of the words Etymo^gy, he is to be called a devout ^n, who does
solemnly dedi^e and bequeath himself to ^e the Lord his God. Deuoti^
certainly is that readiness, ^erby a man does offer up him^e to God, and
prepares him^e to do his most holy will.

Therefore we call deuoti^ that good, which always at^deth upon good and
holy ^yer: and that which always ^tethon it, is a cheerfulness, ^dines and
courage to al good, ^ch often times is found withcomfort, and tenderness of
^t. Wherefore even as a tra^er, A Similitude.
after he has rested himself and taken meat, begins to feel ease, is
refreshed, and recouereth strength to walk and travel further, although he
has no delight in his meat, nor contenteth his taste: so also praye^ which is
the spiritual meat o^ Prayer is cause of Devotion.
the soul, is the cause of a ne^ fortitude and a new spirit to wall in the way
of the Lord, albeit of tentimes it yields no spiritual taste.

Our Savior shows this effect of Prayer, praying in the garden, where rising
from the ear^ now the third time with gre^ courage and invincible spirit, buc^
ling with his enemies, whom one word he beat to the groun^ albeit in that his
Prayer he h^ neither sweetness nor spiritu^ joy: but contrarily so great an
gony and contrition of spirit, the he sweat blood in such about dant manner,
that it trickled ^wne by drops upon the earth. ^e would have this so come to
^sse, not because his grace and ^rtitude either increased or de^eased by
prayer, (for he was full (...) all grace) but that in his own ^oper person he
might show the ^tue and efficacy of Prayer: ^ich although it has not al^ies
that tenderness of heart, and ^mfort of spirit joined unto it: (...) it brings
with it that cheer^ readiness, and resolute courage abide whatsoever adversity:
^d although it does not always ^e away the burdenous weight ^tribulation, yet
nevertheless ^btaineth that strength and for^de, by which it ouercom^th.

Notwithstanding here is to be ^ed, that from this devotion and ^dines to this
good, oftentimes that spiritual consolation do^ spring, which the ignorant and
vn^ learned do call Devotion: an^ the course being altered, the sam^
consolation does increase tru^ devotion, which is that alacriti^ and
cheerefulnes of spirit, as we^ have said, to do well, as a goo^ Daughter
serving her Mother, making a man so much the mo^ ready in divine matters, as it
m^ keth him the more cheerful, more comfort him in his sou^ so that these
two do patroni^ the one the other, none other wise then a faithful mother
do^ her daughter, and a godly daug^ ter her mother. Which thing n^ only
happens in these, but v^ ry often also in other spiritu^ matters, especially
in these t^ virtues, Faith and Charity: (...) Faith and Charity do mutually
help one another.
Faith is the foundation and ro^ of Charity, and Charity is t^ form and life
of Faith. So also ^s consolation does increase ^euotion, and prepares it to
c^y good work, as very plain - ^he Prophet David testifies, ^en he says: I
will run the way Psalm. 119.
^hy commandments, when thou ^st set my heart at liberty. This ^erty and
enlargement does a^ from spiritual joy (for it is (...) properry of joy to
enlarge the ^rt, as on the contrary part it is property of sorrow to pinch ^d
gripe it in) and this enlarge^nt, says he, made not me to ^lke in the way of
the Lord, and ^te by foot to tread this path, (...) with exceeding great
alacry^o run it, which is proper unto ^uotion.

This is the reason, why the ser^ts Why Devotion is to be desired.
of the Lord ought seriously ^esire of God this readiness and ^ituall
consolation, as we will show afterward: not for the delight, which is in it
(for thi^ should be rather our own loue^ then the love of God) but for the
fruit: because it inciteth and stirs us up to do well, for it is (...)
mosttruesaying, that pleasure perfecteth the work.

HOW PROFITABL^ and precious a thing Devotion is. CHAP. II.
IF we diligently and studiousl^ consider, what has been delivered in the
precedent Chapte^ we shall confess, that Devotion is some especial chief
good: for it is a virtue exciting and stirrin^ up all other virtues: and mak^
ing a man ready and fit for all kin^ of good actions. Furthermo^ this virtue is
very laudable; f^ ^s always found in the compa^ of the most excellent virtues
^ith the which it has very near ^iance and affinity, for they all and to the
same end: that is, De^tion, Prayer, Contemplation, Virtues allied unto Devotion.
^e Exercise of divine Love, spi^uall Consolation, and the stu^ of heavenly
Wisdom; which ^as it were a certain delights^me and sweet knowledge of God,
of the which in the sacred, S^riptures there are so many fa^ous praises and
commendations. ^ll these virtues albeit they be ^stinguished and separated in
^ooles, yet they are always ^und together in the same flock society: for
mostco^monly where ^ere is perfect Prayer, there al^ is Devotion, Contemplation,
^rituall Consolation, and actu^ love of God, with all other ^rtues that to them
have any reference or reciprocatio^. For there is so great likeness and
similitude between these virtues, that the passage from one to another i^
most easy: and although they be distinguished between themselves, yet in the
very exercise^ as I said, they work together. For we see that when the
servants o^ the Lord do proceed unto suc^ exercise, first they begin of Me^
ditation, then they pass vnt^ Prayer, and from Prayer to Con. templation, and
from Contemplation they make further progress.

HOW DIFFICVLT the atchiuement of true Devotion is. CHAP. III.
SEeing then that Devotion i^ so excellent a good, no man doubts but that it
is difficult to ^aine: for there is nothing found ^his world, but that the
diffi^tie does equalize the excel^cy. This is manifestly to be ^e in devotion:
for it is no ^e matter to raise up our ima^ation, then the which there is ^ing
more afflicted and depres^: which notwithstanding is ^ired to perfect Prayer
and ^otion. Wherefore Agathon Nothing more difficult then Prayer.
(...) wont to say, that in the busi^ and labors of the Religious, ^ing was
more hard and diffi^ then Prayer. For which cause ^ee that many are exercised
and ^perfeuere in other good acti^ and exercises, as in Fasting, ^ching,
Discipline and Almes^es: who notwithstanding ^ot tolerate nor abide the la^s
of continual Prayer: which ^inely is much to be marvelled at, seeing that in
this most hol^ work we have the holy Spirit a^ helper unto us, and the sacre^
Scriptures, and the Sacrament^ of the Church incensours an^ stirrers of us up.

This difficulty grows from three roots: The first is the cor^ ruption of
nature, which is so de^ praued through sin, that it ha^ no we lost that
Empire and rul^ which at the beginning it had (...) uer the faculties and
powers (...) the soul. And therefore the im^ gination, which is one of then
does what it lists, vageth an^ wandreth whether it will, and o^ tentimes
privily, as a vagabo^ servant, steals out of door^ before we be aware: and
this (...) not always the fault of man but of nature weakened and e^ feebled
through sin.

The second root of this dif^culty, is evil custom, by which ^any through
long use and too ^uche license have accustomed ^e^selues to run hither and
thither, ^d to wander into all places in ^eir imaginations, and to floate
^rough all kind of cogitations. ^ence it is that after that evil ^stome they
can scarcely bind ^eir imaginations to any one ^atter, since so freely and
disso^tely it has accustomed to tra^ell and hunt into all corners of ^e world.
How many men are ^ere found, who desiring to have ^euotion, when they meditate
upon the Lords passion, or some ^ther matter, and now scarcely ^auing begun to
meditate, their ^earts are scattered and disseuered ^to a thousand parts, so
that they cannot fix their eyes upon Christ ^rucified, that thither they might
^end forth the streams of their love?

Do ye know whence this dis^ commodity comes unto you^ even because ye have
put on an^ evil habit, and have suffered you^ hearts to vage and wander with,
out bridle or restraint whether they lysted, and whither they would. Wherefore
now when ye would bridle and restrain them ye cannot: because they are
accustomed unto licencious liberty. Therefore it is needful for him that would
attend upon Prayer that he shut up the gates of his soul, against all the
kinds of vain and unprofitable thoughts, and that by little and little he
change that evil habit into a good, withdrawing his imaginations from
external things to internal, and from earthly things to heavenly. By this
means leasurely, although not sudainly our soul is brought ho^e ^est, and
peaceably enjoys ^quillity.

Notwithstanding we must (...) therefore despair, nor discou^e our selves: for
that is a cer^e violence, but as the heart ^h put on that evil in a long ^e,
so againeit must put it off in ^ng time, and beat back the ^se of a long time
by contrary (...). This shall be done the sooner, (...) more diligent a man shall
be ^editating upon good mat^s; and in restraining the senses (...) those
means, which make ^y unto Devotion.

The third root is the malice ^deuils, who of their inueterate ^y toward
mankind, that ^y may hinder our salvation, do ^relabor to disturb men when ^y
pray, then at other, times ^en they do not: that at the ^st they might take
from them the inestimable fruit of Praye^ and that they might deprive the^ of
innumerable blessings spring^ ing from it. This Origin adm^ nisheth Origin in
his 10. book upon the Epistle to the Romans.
us of, when he says: T^ devils and contrary powers d^ by all might and maine
disturb (...) interrupt in prayer: first that h^ that labors and sweateth
(...) the agony and feruency of praie^ may not be found such an one, (...) to
lift up pure hands witho^ wrath. But if any one can obtai^ that he may be
without wrath, (...) shall hardly avoid debating (...) disputation: that is,
vain a^ superfluous cogitations. For tho^ shall scarcely find any one pray^
ing, to be without some idle an^ frivolous thought, which decly^ neth and
diuerteth that intention by which the mind is directed (...) God, and carries
it whether (...) should not. And therefore the agony and wrestling of Prayer
^reat and difficult, that the mind ^y fixedly and steadfastly attend ^n God,
notwithstanding the ^lting disturbance of enemies, ^o violently carry the
meaning ^im that is praying into diverse ^ractions and sundry imagina^s. This
says Origin, by which ^rds he manifestly shows the ^at difficulty of this
business.

But the divine Grace is oppo^ against all these difficulties, ^ich is mightier
and stronger ^n all things: upon which al^attend all the documents and
^structions, which hereafter we shall deliver.

OF THOSE THINGS that are conducent unto the (...) chiuement of true Devotion,
and first of the great longing desire to obtain it. CHAP. IIII.
We have heeretofo^ told what Deuoti^ is, that it is not any particular
(...) special virtue, but all that whi^ accompanies it: Now we w^ speak of
the means by which (...) is achieved.

First therefore that we m^ win and gain unto us a goo^ so excellent and
renowned, is a^ earnest and a vehement desire t^ possess it, according to that
(...) the Wise man. The most true desi^ of discipline is the beginning of Wis^
dome: and a little before, reason (...) of the same desire and intent, ^ith:
Wisdom shines and ne^adeth away, and is easily seen ^em, that love her, and
found of (...) as seek her, she preuenteth them (...) desire her, that she may
first (...) her self unto them. Who so a^eth unto her betimes, shall ^e no
great travail, for he shall ^e her sitting at his doors. To ^ke upon her
then is perfect ^erstanding: and who so watch^or her, shall be soon without
(...). For she goes about, seeking (...) as are meet for her, and shew^her
self cheerfully unto them ^he ways, and meets them in ^y thought. Hitherto
be the ^rds of the Wiseman, whereup^ a little after he concludes ^t which we
said before, that is: ^at the beginning of Wisdom ^e most true desire and
longing for (...).

This happened to the W^ man himself: for he speake^ not by hearesay of any
vain (...) mour, but taught before, not on^ ly of the holy Ghost, but also b^
the experience of the business (...) self. Wherefore in the Chapt^ following
he says of him selfe^ For this have I desired, and vnde^ standing Sap. 8.
was given unto me, I soug^ after her, and the spirit of Wisdom came into me.
Therefore thou see^ that desire is the beginning o^ this good.

The whole sacred Scripture does manifestly prove this to be true. For how
often I pray the^ do we read in the law, and in the Prophets, that we shall
find God if we seek him with all our hearts? So we read in the book of the
Proverbs: They that betimes watch Prouer. 8.
for me, shall find me. And in another place. If thou seek for Prouer. 2.
wisdom as for silver, and searchest ^er as for treasures, then shall (...)
understand the fear of the ^d, and find the knowledge of God. ^to what end do
we seek for (...) fetched authorities? we have ^ost sure pledge and testimo^ ^f
this from our Savior. Ask, Math. 7.
s^ he, and it shall be given you: ^e and ye shall find: knock and i^albe
opened unto you. For whos^er asks, receives: and he t^ seeks, finds:
and to him t^ knocks, it shall be opened.

The reason why this desire is s^ffectuall to find God is, be^se (as the
Philosophers say) (...) ^uery work, especially morral, t^ love of the end is
the first c^se, that moves the worker, so that by how much the love ^d
desire of the end is greater, (...) so much the endeavor and ^igence is the
greater, which is bestowed to obtain it. Tell (...) I pray thee what cast
Alexan^ the great into so many daunge^ what made him to vndergoe^ many labors,
to strike so man battles? what moved him pass through so many des^ places,
and barbarous nations, b^ the insatiable love, whereby h^ thirsted after the
Empire of t^ whole world? What made t^ servitude of so many years lig^ and
pleasant unto the Patriar^ Jacob, but the love, by which h^ did affecte
beauteous Rachell^ What does mittigate the labou^ and perils of hyrelings*
Marine^ Soldiers and such like men, an^ does make them easy and toll^ rabble
unto them, but the love (...) lucre and gain? If the love (...) things so base
and abject, can d^ so much, what shall not the lou^ of the chiefest good do,
if it b^ rightly known, and truly loved? (...) do not here entice and allure
(...) (O brother) with the frail ^fading beauty of Rachel, nei^ with the
vain glory of the ^ld, which ends together (...) thy life: nor with such
fleei^ actions, which the wind ^s away: nor with the transi^e pleasures of
hypocrites, ^ch endure but for a moment: ^e brief neither with earthly ^es,
which are devoured of ^ths and rust, or are stolen away ^eeues: but we inuit
and al^ thee with the beauty of the ^ne Wisdom, with the king^e of Christ:
with the treasure ^harity: with the comfort of t^ ^holy Ghost: with the meat
(...) Angles: with true peace and (...) true liberty: and to con^e with the
chiefest good. ^at can thou desire more rich and opulent then this treasu^
Blessed is the man, says that et^ nall Prouer. 8.
Wisdom: that hears (...) watching daily at my gates, and (...) uing
attendance at the posts of (...) doors. For he that finds me, fin^ eth
life, and shall obtain favor (...) the Lord.

With these and such like co^ siderations a desire of that spi^ tuall
covetousness, and a thirsti^ for those true riches, is to be ki^ dled and
enflamed in thy hea^ For it is needful that such a desi^ be not luke warm,
lingring^ slow: but lively, careful, dillige^ and exact. Behold I pray the with
what great care of the world, coueteous men, ambition men, and the lovers of
the beauty of some creature do seek after that they love: they do no cease
by day, nor rest by night they speak not, think not, no dream not, but of
those things ^ich they seek for and love. After (...) same manner GOD is to be
^ght for of thee, although wor^er of greater diligence and at^dance, as he is
more excellent ^n all creatures. Behold how ^cumspectly and advisedly the A
Simily.
^der of an Army goes forth to ^ht, when he begirdeth any de^ced Castle: how
many kind of ^tagems he deuiseth; how cun^gly he undermines it, how ar^cially
he raises fortresses, ma^h bulwarks, and how many in^tions he uses to
assault and bat^ the Castle, that at the length ^may conquer it: with no lesser
^e and watchfulnes must thou la^r and endeavor, that thou may ^te unto thy
self that chiefest ^d: for it is written: The king^e Math 11.
of heaven suffers violence, and ^violent take it by force. Worthy is he to be
called happ^ and blessed, who seeks God afte^ such a manner; for he that so
seeks him, has already partly fou^^ him, and has a pledge and an earne^
that he shall obtain the rest. For to watch for God, is to seek hi^ and he

unto thee a liuel^ and feeling desire of his presence. This is the mean, and
this is the ^y, which is to be kept of them in ^eeking for God, who are
preu^ted by the blessing of his s^etnes, and have already seen t^ beautye of

These are the cogitations, these (...) the studies of Ploughmen, of ^ourers
and Smithes, who night ^day sweat through the labors (...) their hands, that
they may obt^ne the end of their desires. Let ^e true and sincere lover of God,
^itate these, let him watch and (...) die day and night, how he may ^ne unto
him so great a good, ^till he be weakened and languish (...) this cogitation and
diligence: ^d also let him testify by the de^tie of his body, the anxietie and
^auines of his mind, according that of the Wise man; Waking Eccle. 31.
^er honesty pineth away the body, ^d the care thereof drives away ^pe. But
perhaps thou will say, ^u prescribest unto me very ^d means and conditions
for (...) attainment of this good. Tell (...) I pray thee, is it not just and
^t that so great a good as God himself is, should be sought for with
diligence? Thou will answer yea. The^ what lesser thogh^ can be demanded,

(...) then to the atchieuement of the chiefest good to require no more
diligence, then that whereby earthly riches may be compassed? For so the words
of the Wiseman d^ sound: If thou seek for wisedom^ P^on. 2.

nifie thee: who being the best (...) chiefest of all goods, yet desire^ not to
be sought for with great^ care, then the basest and vilest^ things, yea with no
greater diligence, then silver is accustomed to be sought with.

THE SECOND thing that begets Devotion, is Fortitude and diligence. CHAP. V.
THe desire, of which we have (...) spoken, ought to have joined ^o it great
diligence and forti^e, by which all difficulties may (...) overcome, which do
meet ^h us and trouble us in compas^g and winning this good. And ^ough, as we
have said before, (...) desire does bring with it dilig^ce and fortitude, yet
we think it ^orth the labor to speak of it s^rally in this Chapter.

But that we may understand t^se things the better, we must k^we, that as
nature has besto^d upon all living creatures two faculties or powers, to the
prese^ uation Two faculties of the soul necessary unto virtue.
of them selves, one, whi^ we call Concupiscible, the natu^ and property of
which, is to des^ whatsoever pertains to the pr^ seruation of it self or of
his kin^ the other Irascible, whose off^ and property is to resist and fig^
against all difficulties and contr^ dictions, which any ways hind^ or make
resistaunce against the preservation: so we must know^ that these virtues and
powers (...) so after their manner are requi^ to the preservation of a spiritu^
life: specially to the attaineme^ of this good which we speake^

For first it is needful to hau^ desire of that good, as we ha^ said, which
does move a man^ seek for it: then it is meet t^ there be a valiant and
genero^ spirit to conquer and ouerco^ many and great difficulties, wh^ ^e meet
with them that aspire ^he atchiuement of Devotion. (...) there are many
things that ^der devotion, and many things ^ich are required to the obtay^g
of it, all which are very dif^lt and hard: therefore they crave ^ch business and
much fortitude (...) courage, to break through ^se difficulties, until those
desi^ waters flow out of the Cest^s of Bethleem, and no enemies 2. Reg. 23.
^er in the entrance or regresse, (...) hinder those, who come to ^we water out
of them. But to ^ine a good so hard and difficult, ^at can a bare and naked
desire (...), if it be not armed and fenced ^h courage and fortitude?

There thou shall acknowledge ^fect, which they have, who (...) with a good
desire, notwith^ding have not this fortitude, which we speak: for they be as
creatures imperfect and monstro^ having the faculty concupiscib^ without the
irascible, which as is not sufficient to the preservation of a natural life,
so also it will n^ be sufficient for that which is sp^ rituall. Such are the
desires of t^ negligent and slothful, of whi^ the Wiseman says: The slugg^
lusts prou. 13.
and lusts not: He luste^ when he beholds the beauty virtue: he lusts not
when h^ understands the difficulty^ which are in it: as those imperfe^ and
monstrous creatures have o^ of these natural faculties and po^ ers, that is,
appetite, or desire: b^ the other they have not, which (...) fortitude and
courage.

For this cause in the Script^ fortitude and diligence are so (...) ten
commended, and slouthfulnes^ negligence are so often disprais^ as the two
roots of all our go^ a^ill. Certainly it is a thing ex^ding worthy of
admiration, to ^he great care and watch, which ^oly Ghost uses over slouth^
and negligent men, as it is ^ifest in the books of Salo - (...), in which
there is scarce a ^pter, which draws not out ^rrow against such, and tells
(...) of the peril and danger they ^in. Although often times it is (...) and
the self same sentence, ^ch is repeated, yet it is done (...) other words and
figures, and ^ost the same thing is spoken ^housand places, that our me^ies
might be stirred up, that (...) thereby might understand, of ^t great moment and
weight (...) which the holy Ghost so of^and with such importunity (...)
rehcarsed. In one place he (...): The thoughts of the diligent Prouer. 2^.
^rely bring abundance: but whosoever is slothful and neglig^ comes surely
to poverty. In a^ other place: A slothful hand (...) keth Prou. 10.
poor: but the hand of the d^ gent makes rich. And in anoth^ place: He that
tilleth his land, s^ Pro. 12.
be satisfied with bread: but he the follows the idle, is destitute of v^
derstanding. Again: Fear cast^ Pro. 18.
down the slothful, and the soules^ the sluggards shall hunger. He t^ is
slothful in his work, is even (...) brother of him that is a great was^ And
in the Chapter followin^ Slouthfulnes causes to fall a sleep^ Pro. 19.
a sluggish person shall be affamish^ But that especially is to be obs^ ued,
which the same Salom^ says in the 24. Chapter of (...) Proverbs. I passed by
the field Pro. 24.
the slothful, and by the Viney^ of the man destitute of vndersta^ ing. And
lo, it was all grown o^ with thorns, and nettles had coue^ (...) face
thereof, and the stone wall ^reof was broken-downe. Then I ^eld, and I
considered it well: I ^ked upon it, and received instruc^. Thou sluggard how
long wilt ^ou sleep? How long will it be ere ^u rise from thy slumbring? Thou
^st yet a little sleep, a little slumber, ^tle folding of the hands to sleep: So
(...) poverty commet has one that tra^leth by the way, and thy necessity (...)
an armed man. Which is as ^ch to say, as that slouthfulnes ^d negligence by
little and little ^all be turned into an habit, and ^at habit into nature, and
by this ^eanes it shall so reign and rule ^thee that thou shall not find
^ither mean nor way how to ^ue it out of thy doors, albeit ^ou be mighty and
magnani^ous.

Now I demand of thee, why ^e holy Ghost does so often repeat this sentence,
and insert in so many places of his writing but that he would signify that d^
ligence and fortitude is the key^ all our profit and commodity, a^ that
slouthfulnes and negligenc^ is the root of all our evils an^ hurtes? Tell me,
what virtue is (...) that has not some difficulty an^ nexed and joined to it?
Therfo^ if a man have not courage to sub^ due it, nor a hammer to work and^
temper the Iron, on which he^ works, shall he perform any^ laudable piece of
work? It is very well said of Prudentius, where he speaks of Patience.
Valerous Patience Virtues copesmate, Prudent. in Psychomachia.

Of every Virtue is strong anchorage:
Victorious becomes virtues combat,
When Patience passions does assuage.
Naked lies Virtue Patience wanting,
Disrobed, disarmed and feebly panting.


For if courage and fortitude be wanting unto Virtue, it is certain, that he
shall not be able to ouer^e the difficulty, which is al^es joined unto Virtue.
Ther^ it is needful, that we expel (...) drive away all sluggishnes and
i^nes, arming our selves with ^rme and solid purpose to ^er this co^bate, with
a resolute ^de to fight, and not to leave (...), before we have overcome ^ry
difficulty, always implo^g with great submission of ^it the divine grace.

We must not forth with be disc^raged nor put out of heart, when a^
contradiction or repugnancy ^th meet with us: but the^ more ^ragiously make
resistance, and ^tate those, who sail against A Similie.
(...) stream: for they by the stren^ of their Oars do strive with (...)
violent fury of the stream, and ^ey be driven back by the ve^ment current of
the river, they faint not, nor leave off, but dou^ their strength and more
manfu^ and stoutly apply their Oars, a^ force their vessel to the finish^ of
their enterprised voyage. Su^ ought our purposes to be, that firm and stable,
and if at any ti^ it happens that we be ouercom^ let us take heart again and
ren^ our strength: for, as it is wont to (...) said, Vntyred labor ouercomm^
all things. So we see many m^ unwearied in the businesses this world, who do
not leave (...) their purposes, albeit fortune ((...) they commonly say) be not

sometimes they recei^ more loss then lucre: neither (...) husbandmen intermit
the tillag^ of the earth, although their fruit often times perish in the
fields but they return a fresh unto the^ labors, and do use more diligence
^ake trial, if so a plentiful har^ may recompense their losses. (...) much more
earnest ought (...) to be in this holy exercise, in ^ch both lesser labor is
to be ^ergone, and profit without ^parison greater may be ex^ed?

^ut We must here note, that, as (...) desire, of which we have to^ spoken,
ought to have forti^e joined unto it, that it be not (...), so to this
fortitude, humility ^st be added, that it be not ^ude. For although in this
busi^ we put to our whole strength, (...) labor with might and maine, (...) we
must always believe, that ^e have not gained so great a ^od unto us by our
own might (...) strength, but that the divine ^ce and mercy has bestowed upon
us. For as the Wise man says: The race is not to the s^ nor the battle to the
strong, ne^ Ecles. 9.
yet favor to men of knowledge. If^ have place in humane matt^ how much more
shall it h^ place in divine, all which dep^ of grace? And because grace

but much more (...) humility profit, then fortitude the obtaining of Devotion.

Therefore let man very hum^ acknowledge and confess his o^ unworthiness and
weakness, let h^ humble himself under the mig^ hand of the Lord, let him come i^
his sight, as an infan^, who kno^ nothing, neither can do any thin^ and let him
beseeeh him by t^ merits of Christ, that he wou^ vouchsafe to look upon him
w^ the eyes of his pitye, and wou^ give unto him as to the poore^ beggar, the
cru^mes falling fro^the ^of his great mercy. But with ^are confession and

some do, but he must ^s hand to the plough, and do (...) lies in him, and
then God ^oe that which belonges to (...) For as the Lord is a friend (...) the
humble, so also is he an ^y unto the slothful and idle.

^E THIRD THING ^t begets Devotion, is the watch and keeping of the heart.
CHAP. VI.
^Hese two Principles and (...) foundations being laid and ^lished, that we may

chief instrument of that heau^ ly music) be first well tuned^ prepared: for
there can bee^ harmonious consort in a iar^ and untuned instrument. He^ is that
counsel of Salom^ Keep thine heart with all dilige^ for there out comes
life. For s^ ing Prou. 4.
that the heart is the founta^ and beginning of all our actio^ it is certain
that as it is, so (...) so are all the actions that p^ ceede from it. Neither
(...) this cause only must we b^ careful for the guarding and watch ^e
heart, but also for the lan^ment and tenderness of the ^t, which how easily it
is di^ted and disturbed cannot be ^ed by any words. For it is ^out doubt one
of the chief (...) especial miseries of men, ^e their hearts so hardly to be
^llected and gathered to them, ^so easily to be disseuered and ^earsed: and yet
they must la^r by so many means, before ^y can obtain a little Deuoti^ and
that whatsoever is got^is so easily lost. We see that ^ke, and many other
meats (...) so delicate and dainty, that the ^y air does taynt them and ^ke
the^ unsavory, and the vntem^atenes of the air, as some af^me, does put a Lute
or a harp (...) of tune: much more greater ^thout doubtis the tenderness and
daintines of man's heart, and (...) troubled for lesser cause. Eu^ as the sight
of the eyes is h^ with a small thing, and the brigh^ nes of a glass is stained
and o^ scured with a little breath: so^ much lesser chance, and a mu^ lighter
hurt is enough to dim^ the brightness of our heart, to da^ ken the eyes of our
soul, and (...) disturb together with our Deu^ tion, all our good affection^
Therefore we must endeuo^ with great diligence, and with (...) our strength,
that we very car^ fully and safely keep a treasu^ so precious, and which is
so easil^ lost.

But if you shall ask me, from what things the heart is to b^ kept, I say
especially from two (...) that is, from vain cogitations, and (...) inordinate
affections. From these two, it is meet that the heart be^ fre^ and pure, in
which the holy ^st shall dwell. As Paynters ^wonte first to mundifie and ^elime
the table in which they ^t, so also the table of our heart ^st to be wiped and
whited, in ^ch the image of God shall be ^red and formed. This is that ^shing
of the two tables which (...) Lord commanded Moses to Exodus 34. Deuteronomy. 10.
^e and square, that with his ^e hand he might write the ^ds of the law in
them: that ^ight signify, that man must ^difie, polish and square the (...)

Neither is the heart only (...) so^ly to be kept pure and clean (...)
noisome and hurtful cogita^s, but also from inordinate ^ctions: for there is
not any ^g more forcible to disturb and ^uiet it, then natural passions: ^re
love, hate, mirth, heaviness, ^e, hope, desire, wrath, and other (...) unto
these.

^ese are the winds which toss (...) turmoile this sea: these be the ^des
which obscure this hea^: these be the weights which ^resse our spirit. For it
is cer^e that passions with their co^tions do disturb the heart, (...) their
appetites do disseuer (...) distract it, with their affecti^ do captiuate it,
and with their ^turbations and inordinate mo^s do darken and blind it.
^erefore even as our fleshly (...) cannot be hold the stars, nor (...) beauty

Bishop, yet he would not ^angle himself neither with ^tters of his
Bishoppricke, nor (...) any other secular business, ^ies fearing, least by this
^anes his heart should be in^ed and wrapped in the cogi^ons of visible matters.

^r this cause we here so great^ommend mortification and the ^deration and
temperance of ^ions. For there is not any ^g, which so strongly does ^le our
heart, and captiuate it, ^uery one of those appetites, (...) especially that of

CHAP. VII.
^O this keeping of the heart, there is nothing more profi^e or commodious,
then always ^alke in the presence of the ^d, and to have him always be^ our
eyes, not only in the time ^ayer, but in all places and at ^mes: for there be
many, that ^o long modest and quiet, as (...) Master is present, but he ^g
gone, they disorder them^es, and do follow the rage (...) vyolence of their
own af^ons.

^he servant of the Lord must not imitate these, but he must rather labor, that
he may keep the heat, which he has got in prayer, and to continue those
cogitations holy, which he has: for these being continued and kep^ do lift a
man to the top and heigh^ of perfection.

He that does otherways, a^ his life passes away in doing and undoing, in
weauing and vnweauing, neither shall he ever come to his wished end^

This is that happy vnyo^ of our spirit with God, which the Saints have so
hyghly esteemed and made so great accoun^ of: for the attainement of which they
have taken so great paines^ and which they have appointe^ the last end of all
their exercise^ This is that, that David intimate^ that he had obtained, when
he repeateth so often in his Psalmes^ that God was always before his ^es; that
he did continually medi^te upon his law: and that his praise ^as ever in his
mouth. So that al^eit he was a King and very much ^ployed in many businesses
^oth of war and peace, yet in the ^yddest of so many cogitations ^d
consultations he was quiet, ^d albeit so many servants and ^ttendors stood
about him, yet he ^ood alone with God.

Wherefore thou shall do a thing right worth thy labor, ^f with all thy
strength thou endeuourest, that thou may always have with thee this presence
and remembrance of the Lord: for it shall much benefit and profit thee to
consider that God is always and every where present, not only by his power
and presence, but also by his essence.

A King in all his territories is present by his power, and in his palace by
his presence, but by his essence, he is no where but in that place, which
possesses his body: God after all these ways is present in every place. Which
besides God is present every where.
our faith, this reason does also prove: It is God that gives to all
creatures to be and to live: God is the beginning and cause of all things.
But seeing that it is necessary that the cause be joined with the effect,
either by it self, or by some virtue or influence, it follows, that sithence
God is the cause of all things, that they are, that he is also joined unto
them, giving them to be, that they are: and that not by some virtue or
influence, but by himself: for in God there is that distinction of things,
which is in the creatures.

For whatsoever is in God, is of God, and therefore wheresoever ^e wills,
that something of him should be, he is all that.

And because the Essence of things is the nearest unto the things, neither is
any thing more inward in them, it follows that God is more in them, then the
things are in themselves. What great thing is it then, if thou have God
always before thine eyes, who carries thee in his arms, who supporteth thee
with his feet, who governs thee by his providence, in whom and by whom thou
live and have thy being? Remember that he always assisteth thy soul as the
creature and governor, who preserves thee in thine Essence, neither is he
content that he assisteth thee as thy creator and preserver, but also he is
present with thee as thy iustifier, bestowing upon thee grace, love and many
holy inspirations and desires. Let him be the witness of thy life, let him be
the companion of thy pilgrymage, commit unto him part of thy business, commend
thy self unto him in all thy perils and dangers, in the night talk with him
in thy sleep, and with him awake in the morning.

Sometimes contemplate him as a glorious God among his Angels in heaven:
sometimes as a mortal man among men, conversant upon the earth: now in the
bosom of his Father, now in the arms of his mother* a little after wait upon
him flying into Egypt, thence return again with him out of Egypt: sometimes
join thy self unto him praying in the Garden, sometimes follow him to the
Mount even of Caluary, neither forsake him hanginge on the Cross.

When thou sit down at the Table, let his Gall and Vinegar be the sauce
of thy meat, and let the Fountain of the blood (flowing from his most Noble
and glorious breast) be the cup out of which thou drynkest. When thou go to
bed, imagine thy bed to be his Cross, and thy Pillow his Crown of Thorns:
when thou put off or on thy clothes, meditate with what great ignominye
Christ in his passion was sometimes arrayed and sometimes spoiled of his
garments.

This is with those holy Virgins to follow the Lamb, whether soever he
goes: by this means thou may be be a Disciple of Christ, and always
remain in his company. In all these things always talk with him with
humble speeches and full of love: so he will have him self dealt with, who for
the greatness of his Majesty ought worthily to be feared, and for his goodness,
exceedingly to be loved.

Although thou be busied with some manual labor, or with any other business,
yet for this thou must not omit nor intermit this holy exercise. For the Lord
has given this aptnes and promptnes to our hearts, that in a moment they may
be turned unto him, albeit the body remain occupied in an external work; none
otherways then an handmayde who A Simily.
works in ye presence of a Queen, she stands before her Lady with great
grauitye, with presentnes of mind, and orderly composition of body, making
neither loss nor delay in her work; that one business hinders not another, so
also our heart with due reverence and attention, may be lifted up to that
majesty, which fills heaven and earth, not omitting norneglecting any of
those things it does.

Neither only when a man does attend upon any manual labor, but also when he
speaks, studyeth or is busied, etc. he may sometimes have his heart attentive
to his business, and yet nevertheless enter into the temple of his heart, to
worship the Lord, and withdraw himself from those things, which his business
requires, and speedily return unto GOD. Those holy creaturs are a figure of
this, which Ezechiel saw coming and going in the likeness of bright lightning,
whereby we understand the swiftnes and alacrity, by which the righteous ought to
be turned unto the Lord, when as upon some godly and religious occasion they
go out of the closset of their devotion, to succor and relieve their
neighbor. But if at any time a man shall linger and loyter and forget to
return unto God, he must be stirred up with the spurs of attentio^ and
diligence, by turning the reins of his heart unto God, and saying with the
Prophet; Return O my soul into rest, because the Lord has blessed Psalm. 114.
thee.

THE FIFTH THING that stirs up Devotion, is the use of short Prayers, which
in all places and seasons, are as darts, to be sent unto God. CHAP. VIII.
Without doubt that man is exceeding happy, that knows well to observe and
keep the precedent instruction and document. But that no man may fail in it,
it is most profitable in all places and seasons to use those short and succinct
prayers, of which Augustine speaks. The brethren (says he) are said to have
in Egypt August. to Proba.
often and frequent prayers, but those very short, and suddenly dartedforth:
least that erected and advanced vigilance (which is very necessary for him
that prays) vanish away through long delay, and too much prolixitie. Even as
they that inhabit the North parts of the A Simily.
world, where the cold is vehement, do keep within doors, and in hot houses to
defend themselves from the injury and vntemperatenes of the weather: but they
that cannot do this, come often to ye fire, and being somewhat warmed, do
return again to their labor: so also the servant of God, living in this cold
and miserable regio^ of the world, where charity is waxen key cold, and
iniquity does rage and abound, must often repair to the fire of prayer, that
he may grow warm. He is truly happy, to whom it is given always to sit in
that hothouse, of which the Prophet speaks: And he shall be as one, that it is
hid from the wind, and covered from Esaias. 32.
the tempest. But let him that cannot have this, often come to this Divine
fire, that he may defend him self from winds, and from the intolerable
ycenes of the frozen region of this world.

Hitherto belong these short and succinct Prayers, which for this cause are
called darting, because as it were are the darts of a loving soul, which with
great celerity are shot forth, and do wound the heart of God: by force of
which, the soul is stirred up, and is more enflamed with the love of God. Very
many verses of David are profitable and conducent unto this purpose, which a
man ought always to have in readiness, that by them he may be lifted up unto
God: not always after the same manner, least the assiduity of the same words
breed wearines, but with all variety of affections, which the holy Ghost does
stir and raise up in his soul: for he shall find convenient and meet
verses for all these in this heavenly seminary of Psalms.

Sometimes he may lift up his heart by the affection of repentance, and desire
of remission of sins, by these words: Turn away thy face, O Lord, from my
Psalm. 51.
sins, and put away allmine iniquitities. Erect in me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right spirit within me. Sometimes he may say with the affection of
thankfulness: My soul, praise thou the Lord, and forget not all his benefits.
Sometimes Psalm. 103.
he may say with the affection of Love and Charity; I will love thee dearly,
O Lord my strength. The Lord is my rock, my Psalm. 18.

trust. As the Heart brayeth for the rivers of water, so pants my soul Psalm.

after thee O God. My soul thirsts for God, even for the living God: when
shall I come and appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my
meat day and night, while they daily say unto me, where is thy God?
Afterward being inflamed with the love of eternal happiness, let him cry: O
Lord of hosts, how amiable are thy Tabernacles? My Psalm. 84.
soul longs, yea, and faints for the courts of the Lord. Saint Hierome
writes in a certain Epistle, that the Fathers of Egypt had wont to have very
often in their mouths, a short verse of the same Prophet, and to say; O that I
had wings like Psalm. 55.
a dove, then would I fly away and rest. Sometimes with a confession of his own
misery, and a desire of the divine grace let him call; Incline thine Psalm. 86.
ear, O Lord, and hear me: for I am poor and needy. And to conclude let this
brief verse be very often in our speeches and conferences: O God, have thee to
deliver me: make have to help me, O Lord. In like Psalm. 70.
manner let the times and places, and businesses, which we attend, and Of al
things we must take an occasion of Devotion.
whatsoever we see or hear minister occasion by other means and affections to
lift up our hearts unto God: for he that loves God truly be holds God in all
things, and thinks that al things do inuit him unto his love. In the
morning the chirping and harmony of birds, in the night silence and quiet
calmnes inuit us to praise the Lord. In our eating, the grace, which is
bestowed upon our meats for our satisfying: when in the morning we arise, the
grace which has kept us in our sleep, and that we are refreshed with it: the
beauty of the Sun and stars, and the decking and embellishment of the
fields do intimate and insinuate unto us the providence and beauty of our
Creator, and the misery and calamity of other creatures does witness and
testify unto us the divine grace, which God uses in freeing and delivering
them.

When the clock gives a sign of the passed hour, let us call to mind the
hour of our death; and also that hour, in which God vouchsafed to dye for us,
and let us read and meditate on those words, which a holy Father teaches,
saying: Blessed be the hour in which my Lord Jesus Christ was born and dyed
for me. So often as any temptation does assail us, or any impure or hurtful
thought does enter into us, prayer is very necessary to cast it out of our
hearts. In like manner as often as we enterprise and undertake to do any thing,
wherein we fear that we shall find contradictions and hindrances, or dread
new occasions of dangers, it behooves us to defense and arm our selves with
the weapons of Prayer: When we at any time go out of our doors, when we are
to have business with a wrangling and a contentious man, or to deal in any
matter of great moment and consequence, when we come to a banquet, wherein
there is danger of sinning, either through gluttony, or too much talk, in
these and suth like matters a great preparation of Prayer is to be sent before.
By this means all things will become motives unto us to have always something
to do with God, and of all things we shall receive fruit, and at all times
have occasion to pray. This is that continual exercise, to the which the
Apostleinuiteth us, saying: Touching and admonishing your own selves, in
Psalms, and hymmes, Col. 3.
and spiritual songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord. And
whatsoever ye shall do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks to God even the Father by him.

This exercise very much helps to Devotion: for it is as the watchman and
keeper of the house watching that none beside God enter to take possession of
ye soul. It is profitable also to preserve the heat of Devotion: hence it is,
that they that are freequent in this consideration, do very easily call unto
them their minds, and gather together their senses and spirits, when they are
to pray.

For what other cause, do thou think there is, that one forth with at the
beginning of prayer does enjoy tranquillity and peace of mind, an other
scarcely aftermany hours, and after long prayer can quiet his heart and make
it peace able? The cause is obuious and common, because the one has his heart
gathered unto him and warmed with these short and succinct prayers: the other
through forgetfulness of God is waxen key cold, and therefore the one sooner
waxes hot, the other later. We A Simily.
see this in a furnace, which if it be well heated in ye morning, is kept hot
all the day after with a little fire: but if it grow stone cold again, it
requires a great deal of fire, before it be thoroughly heated again: so it is
necessary that they do, that will be devout, that this divine heat may be
preserved in their hearts, unless they will undergo new troubles in heating
them so often as they go to pray. For the Deuoton of our heart is A Simily.
as heat in water, or in iron, which naturally is cold, but accidentally hot:
for when it is taken from the fire, of which it was made hot, forth with it
returns to his former and proper estate and condition. He therefore that
would always keep iron hot, it behooves him either always to keep it in the
fire, or often to put it into ye fire, that so the external heat may be kept in
it: the same diligence is necessary in the nourishing and warming of our hearts.

THE SIXTH THING that increases devotion, is the reading of devout and
profitable books. CHAP. IX.
THe Devout reading of spiritual books is very conducent and much avails to
this keeping and purity of ye heart: for as Bernard says: our heart is like a
mill, which never rests, but always grindeth that which is cast into it: if
it be wheat, it grindeth wheat: if barley, it grindeth barley. Therefore it is
profitable to be busied and occupied in the reading of holy and sacred books,
that when it does consider and meditate upon any thing, it may meditate upon
things, which it is busied and occupied in. For this cause Saint Hierome in all
his Epistles does so much commend the reading of the holy Scripture, but
especially in that, which he writ to the Virgin Demetria, in the beginning
whereof he says thus. Hierome in an Epistle to the Virgin Demetria. Cap. 5.
Thou sacred Virgin always have this care
And let it daily be thy food and fare:


That thou nourish thy mind and feed thy soul with the holy reading of the
sacred Scriptures, and not suffer the seeds of tares and darnell to fall into
the good ground of thine heart. In the end of the same Epistle he does repeat
In the last Chap.
the foresaid counsel, saying: I join the end to the beginning, neither am I
content once to have admonished thee, love the holy Scriptures, and Wisdom
will love thee: love her, and she will preserve thee: honor her, and she will
embrace thee.

THE SEVENTH thing that begetteh Devotion, is the keeping of the senses. CHAP.
X.
THe keeping of the senses shall very much help to the keeping of the heart:
for these be as it were the gates of the City, by which all things enter in
and go out: he therefore that keeps well these gates, unto him all things shall
be in safety. It is needful therefore that one keeper and watchma^ be set over
the eyes, another over the ears, and a third over ye mouth: for by these three
gates all wares and Merchandise, and whatsoever is in the world, is carried into
the soul, and exported out of it. So that a devout man ought to be deaf, dum
and blind, as the holy Fathers in Egypt were wont to say: For the gates of
these senses being shut, the soul will always be pure and prepared to the
contemplation of heavenly things.

For a man must sometimes of necessity hear and see those things which are the
causes of distraction and perturbation: wherefore let him so hear and see
outward things, that they do not contaminate his heart. The servant of God
ought to have his heart as a strong wall, and as a ship well built, soundly
ioynted, and surely pitched, which easily repelleth the billowing waves, and
albeit covered with them, yet neither admits nor receives any into her
womb. It may be to figure out this, God commanded Noah to to make his Arc
bowing and vawted, and to pitch it well within and without: for such an one
ought to be the arc of our heart, that in the midst of the waters, and in the
tempestuous deluge of this world it may be secure, and admit no waters of
iniquity. They that keep their hearts after this manner, are always peaceable,
of a present mind, and devout: but they that open the gates to al winds, and
admit all affections and hurly burlies of this world, in the time of prayer
they are distracted with many contentions, wars and disturbed troublesome
cogitations. It happens A Simily.
unto these as to those, who go to parle and confer with a Prince with a
stomach laden and ouercharged with gross and vndigestible meats, who in the
midst of their speech do filthily vomitte forth, what they have greedily
devoured: so these also in the fittest and most convenient time of prayer
talking with God, do belch forth the garlic and onions of Egypt, that is,
cogitations and businesses of the world, of which their hearts are full. Such in
vain do expect fruit of their paryers: for that curse of the Patriarch is
proper unto them, saying: Thou wast light as water, thou shall not be Genesis 49.
excellent. For they have a heart so light and powered forth, and busied with
external matters, that they so much the less increase within, as they are
powered forth about outward things. Such are they, that whole days together
walk abroad to see lofty buildings, sumptuous houses, magnificent temples, and
such like things: who are desirous to see fair and beautiful sights, and to
hear news: for they return to ye houses of their hearts full of wind, and empty
of Devotion. These as they are wandering and unstable in their souls, so also
are they in their bodies: for they can scarely abide one moment in one place:
but run up and down from one place to another: and when they have not whether
to go, they follow whether ye wind leads them, seeking if they may find any
thing abroad to delight them, because within the^ they have lost true delight
and joy. It happens also often times, that in such like ways the devil is
their leader and guide, and does lead them as he in times past led Dinah into
dishonest places, where they do not only lose their devotion, but also their
chastity and innocence. Therefore it is needful that we eschew all these
distractions and perturbatio^s, that all ye strength of our souls being gathred
together, we may have greater fortitude to seek for ye chiefest good: for it is
written; The lord building up Psalm. 147.
Jerusalem, does gather together the dispersed of Israel.

But amongst all the owtward members, the tongue is especially Ber. in his
Sermon of the threefold keeping of the tongue, the hands and the heart.
to be kept: for it is as Bernard says, a small member, but unless thou take
heed unto it a great evil, little and narrow, says he it is, but an instrument
most fit to euacuate and empty the heart. It cannot be spoken how soon and
easilye the juice of devotion fades and vanishes away, when the mouth is
opened to speak superfluous things, albeit they be good. Therefore it is very
well spoken of a certain D^ctor: as sweet water standing A Simily.
in an open vessel, having no cover, does forthwith loose the sweetness and
grace of the sent: so the sweet and precious ointment of devotion, does loose
all the virtue and efficacye, when the mouth is loosed and dissolute, that is,
when the tongue does lavish and superabound in too much talk and prattle.
Therefore it is best to be silent^, and if at any time it be needful to speak,
yet speedily with the Dove return into the Genesis 8.
Arc, least thou perish in the Deluge of words.

And although moderation be necessary for all, yet it is more to be observed
of women then of men: but especially of Virgins, whose chiefest ornament is
shamfastnes, and silence: both being the keepers and preseruers of chastitye.
Wherefore Saint Ambrose very well admonishes a Virgin in these words. O
Virgin be circumspect and choice in thy way, least thou offend in thy tongue:
for often times good words in Virgins are taken for faults.

THE EIGHT THING that increases Devotion, is solitarines. CHAP. XI.
Exterior solitarines does also very much help this keeping of the senses and
the heart, as a certain Schoole-man testifies in these words: Solitarines
seems much to avail to the contemplation of heavenly things: for prayer
cannot well and decently be performed in tumultes and hurly burlies, and to
hear and see many things can scarcely be done without impuritye and offense.
For death enters by our windows unto our souls: and therefore after the
example of our Lord go into the desert, that is, as much as thou can,
separate thy self from the company of others, and be solitary, if thou will be
joined unto him, and see him by the purity of thy heart: fly also the frequent
meetings and talkatiue conferences, especially of worldly persons. Seek not
for new devotions and amities: fill not thine eyes and ears with vain
fantasies, and eschew all things, which disturb and trouble ye quiet of the
mind, and the tranquilitye of the soul, as venomous and hurtful to the
soul. For not without cause the holy Fathers desired to live in woods, and in
places far remote from the company and frequenting of men. This says the
schoolman. But that thou may be more confirmed and strengthened in this, hear
what Saint Bernard says: If thou Bern. in his 40. Sermon upon the Canticles.
be moved with the provocation and instigation of the holy spirit, and do
by all means endeavor to make thy soul the spouse of God, sit by the Prophet
solitarily, because thou have lifted thy self above thy self, longing to be
espoused to the Lord of Angels. Lament. 3.
Is it not above thy self to be joined unto God, and to be one spirit with
him? Sit solitarilye as a Tvrtle, have nothing to do with thy self, nor with
the multitude and throng of others, yea forget Psalm. 44.
thine own people and thy Fathers house, and the King shall have pleasure in thy
beautye. O holy soul get thee aparte, that thou may perform thy service to
him alone, whom thou have made choice of before all others. Fly public
assemblyes, avoid also those that are domestical with thee: separate thy
self from thy friends and from them that are the nearest unto thee, and from
him that ministers unto thee. Do thou not know that thy bridegroom is
shamefast, and will not afford thee his sweet and pleasant prepresence,
others being present? Therefore separate thy self not in body, but in mind:
but in intention, but in devotion, but in spirit. For the spirit before thy
face is Christ thy Lord, and the spirit requires not solitarines of body:
albeit sometimes separate thy self in body, when thou may do it fitly,
especially in the time of prayer. And afterward: Thou art alone if thou
think not upon common matters, if thou do not affect things present, if
thou dispisest that which many love, if thou co^temnest that which many
desire, if thou eschewest brawlings, if thou do not languish for losses, if
thou do not remember iniuryes: otherwise although thou be alone in body,
yet thou art not alone. Do thou not see that thou may be alone, yea among
many? and seeing you art alone among many, thou art alone in what assemblye of
people soever thou art: only beware that thou be not too curious a searcher, or
too rash a judge of other men's conuersations. Hitherto Bernard.

Therefore let a devout man love and seek for solitarines, not only that which
is internal, but also that which is external: for it is certain that the one
is helped by the other. It is reported that Arsenius heard a voice saying unto
him: Arsenius fly, be silent and at rest. Let every one think that the same is
also spoken unto him, and let him fly and avoid all kind of commerce, society,
conversation, conference, consolation, visitation, yea of friends and parents,
unless either charity require it, or necessitye command it. Let a man
always desire to be alone, let him meditate with himself, let him live to
himself, and let him confer with God, who is the lover of solitarines.

And let no man think that such a life is full of melancholye and heaviness: it
is so much the more delectable and pleasant, by how much the society and
familiarity with God is sweeter, then that which is with men. For this cause
Saint Hierome says: The town Hierome in his Epist.
is a prison unto me, but the desert a Paradise. And Bernard says: With whom
God is, he is never Bern. in his Epist.
less alone, then when he is alone: for then he freelye enjoys his hearts
joy, then he is his own man to enjoy God in himself, and himself in God,
etc. what Paradise can be more pleasant in this pilgrimage, then that which
God promises to a soul devout, and attendinge upon him, when as he says:
Behold, I will allure Os^. 2.
her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak friendly unto her, and I will
give her her vineyardes from thence, and the valley of Achor for the door of
hope, and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day
when she came up out of the land of Egypt.

These be the songs and himmes of a soul asce^ding from ye earth, and going
out of this world, and by little and little, more and more increasing in the
love and knowledge of her Creator. These be the days of her spiritual youth,
when the love is stronger and more vehement. These songs are sung in the
wilderness, and in the valey of Achor, which is of trouble: by which is
understood the humility of contrition: for there the way unto hope is first
opened unto the soul, and there she receives remission of sins: there she
prayseth and lawdeth her Creator, because with so mighty an arm, and with so
merciful an hand, he has delivered and freed her from this world. These be
the wages, which God gives unto his friends for the troubles and turmoyles of
the wilderness.

This solitarines is not only profitable and conducent unto devotion, but also
unto all other virtues: for it cutteth off all the occasions of sin, which are
wont to happen in the assemblyes and companies of men: but especially the
occasions of falling in the tongue, which almost are infinite. Therefore Seneca
gives very good counsel, that solitarines is to be sought for of him, that
would keep his innocencye.

NINTHLY, APPOINted times, and certain set hours, do very much make to the
increasing of Devotion. CHAP. XII.
ALl which before has been spoken, does especially belong to the keeping of
the heart, which not only is the mother of pure prayer, but also of all other
virtues. But that which hereafter we are to speak, does chiefly belong to
stir up devotion. And first it is required, that a devout Certain set times
of prayer are be appointed.
man prescribe unto himself appointed times, and certain set hours to
pray in, that alone he may speak with God alone. The Prophet Daniel did this,
of whom Dan. 6.
the Scripture speaks, that the windows of his chamber being opened toward
Jerusalem, three times a day he bended his knees, and worshipped before his God.
The same did David, who in ye nights lifted up his hands, and in the morninges
did meditate of the Lord, as he testifies of himself in many places of his
Psalms: in one of which he says, that seven times a day he did praise the
Lord.

Luke writes of the faithful in the prymatiue Church, that daily with one
accord they continued in the Temple in prayer, and at night returned home,
where they received the holy Communyon together, with gladness and simplycity
of heart, being full of the comfort of the holy Ghost. Of those, who succeeded
these, Plyn^e thus Pliny in an Epist. to Traian.
writes to Traian the Emperor*

The Christians are a people innocent, void of vice and offense, neither have
they any other fault then that they gather themselves together in assemblies
before day, where they sing praises and hymmes, in the honor of a certain man
called Christ, who was crucified in Palestina. What need we many words? it is
written of all the Saints, that they passed the greater part of the night in
spiritual exercises, prayers, contemplations and readings, fulfilling that of
David: In the night lift up your hands to the Sanctuary, Psalm. 145.
and praise the Lord. But far above all these is that example of our Savior,
of whom the Evangelists writ, that in the day time he was busied in working
miracles, and in preaching the kingdom of God: but in the night perseuered in
watching and prayer.

This belongs not only and solely to the clergy, as some vainly babble: but
to all them, that desire to enjoy God, and to come to the perfection of life.
Saint Hierome in an Epis. to Celantia. Cap. 6.
Hierome exhorts a certain noble Woman called Celantia to do thus, in these
words: So take care for thy house and family, that thou may bestow some time
and leisure upon thy soul. Choose for thy self some fit place, somewhat
removed from the noise of thy family, into which, as into a haven thou may
betake thy self out of the great storm and tempest of thy cares, and there
appease and assuage by the tranquillity of thy secret closset, the waves and
billows of cogitations raised by outward troubles.

Let there be so much study of Divine reading, so many entercourses of
prayers, so firm and solid cogitation of future things, that by this leisure
thou may recompense all the businesses of the other time.

Neither do we say this to that end, that we may withdraw thee from thine
affairs, but we do it, that there thou may learn, and there medytate,
what an one thou ought to show thy self in thine affairs. This says he.

But if thou shall ask me, how often in a day thou shall turn thee unto this
study, and take this task in hand; I cannot prescribe a certain rule unto
thee: for all men have not the same occasions of leisure and readiness.

Yet remember that in the law the two daily Sacrifices, the The two daily
Sacrifices.
morning Sacrifice and the evening, are very often commended, which every
Christian ought spiritually to offer, withdrawing himself at those times from
external things, that he may attend upon Celestial matters.

That as twice in a day we refreshe our bodies, that is, at dinner, and at
supper: so also twice a day we give the due nourishment unto our souls:
seeing that it is of no lesser dignity, then the body: neither is the meat
less necessary for the soul, then for the body, yea it is much more
necessary.

The ordinarye nourishment is necessary for the body, because the natural
heat does always consume and waste the substance of man: and therefore it is
necessary, that it be repaired on the one side, as it is decayed on the other:
so the soul has in it a pestilent heat (which is the concupiscence, and
evil inclination of our appetites) consuming and wasting all good: therefore
it is needful that that be daily repaired by Devotion, which is wasted and
decayed by that hurtful and pestilentiall heat.

We must also know, that man's nature by sin is corrupt, inclynable to all
earthly things, which by the weight does draw man unto it, as the Wiseman
says: A corruptible body is heavy unto the soul, and the earthly mansion
keeps Wisedo. 9.
down the mind that is full of cares.

Therefore as they that have the charge and keeping of a A Simily.
Clock, are wont every day twice to wind up the plummets, for they of their
own proper motion do by little and little descend, and draw toward the
ground: so they that desire to keep their souls upright, and well ordered,
ought at the least twice a day to erect and lift up her weightes: seeing that
our wretched nature is so inclynable to things below, that it always
endeavors to sink downwards.

Ah how evidently do they daily feel this that pray. How often does a man
(his morning prayer being ended) think that the weight and poyse of his clock
is lifted up into heaven, and that he has all his intention and will fixed
above: so that he seems not to vouchsafe to behold these earthly things:
and a little after, when he shall turn himself to his daily affairs, and
begins to traffic with men, when as the evening comes, he shall perceive
the plummet even to have fallen and lie upon the earth: that is, he shall
find his spirit so sunk down into the earth, and inclyned to earthly
things, as though it had never been lifted nor wound up. He therefore that
would always have the clock of his life well ordered and governed, he must
always have a special regard to wind up the plummets and wightes of it. Yet
notwithstanding so, that no violence be offered.

They that have not conueniency nor leisure to pray twice in a day, let them
endeavor themselves Those that cannot long pray must have recourse to those
darting prayers, spoken of before.
to pray once. But if they cannot do this, I know not what counsel to give
them else, then that they have recourse to those short prayers, which wehaue
spoken of before, which may be intermingled with all kind of our occupations
and businesses. For I remember that I have seen good and godly spirits
supported by the use and help of these, whose condition, manner of living, and
infirmity did not permit them to have any longer prayers: albeit these kind of
prayers cannot long hold out, if the foundation of other profounder and longer
prayers be wanting.

THE TENTH THING that does kindle Devotion, is the continuing and perseuering
in good exercises. CHAP. XIII.
But that this exercise may be profitable, we must note, that in this place
duration and long perseverance is required in it. For there are many found,
that never make an end of that they once began, but always weaue and unweave
(as they say) the web of Penelope.

These propounding this way unto themselves, do stick to it two or three
days, and forthwith are tired and do forget it, so that when they return to
that they began, they are so cold, and so far removed from themselves, as if
they had never begun, or as if they had never heard, no not by a dream, what
prayer is. Therefore they betake themselves to new purposes, and they choose
again unto themselves a new exercise, and when they have somewhat proceeded,
either through wearines, or because they think they have taken pains enough,
they return unto rest, and forget their labor.

And so they spend their whole life in building and pulling down, and in
rolling (as it is said) the stone of Sisyphus, which when they have rolled to
the midst of the mountain, suddenly it falls down, and so in beginning and
in rolling they consume their whole age.

Such are they that upon every small and light occasion do forsake their
prayers and laudable exercises: to whom it often happens (as I have tried by
experience) that whilst they purpose to intermit their prayers only for two or
three days, they intermit it all their life long.

For when they would return unto it, they find no gate nor entrance unto it:
and the way unto it becomes daily more difficult unto them: therefore they stay
without, and return to the custom of their ancient life. For a man without
prayer, and without spiritual exercise, is as Sampson without his hair: who
forth with loses his strength, and remains feeble and weak, like other men,
and is greatly endangered, least he fall into the hands of his enemies.

Therefore it behooves us to be firm and stable in this exercise: for it is
certain, that of the constancye and ordering of it, depends all our life.

Contemplate in the celestial bodies, how great a constancy and firmenes they
keep in their course and motion, which they never changed since the time,
wherein they were created. For seeing that they weretobe ye causes on which the
administration of the whole world was to depend, it was needful that in them
there should be great constancye, that the world might be always well ordered
and disposed. So seeing that of this spiritual exercise, the whole order and
process of a spiritual life depends, as experience teaches, it is meet
and requisite, that he that would have his life well ordered and disposed,
that he have the causes well ordered and disposed, on which the ordering of it
depends.

See with what constancye the Prophet Daniel did observe these three times of
prayer, when neither by the fear of death, nor by the gayn-sayinge of his
enimyes, he could be brought from his accustomed order: so that he chose
rather to endaunger his life, then to break off his set course of prayer.

So also a devout man ought so firmly to purpose with himself, and
inuiolablye decree, to attend and wait upon God at his accustomed hours, that
he would rather fail in all other his businesses, which concern not God, then
in this one so greatly commended of GOD. Imi tate the natural prudency of
Serpe^ts, who hiding A Simily.

which is of less weight, they may preserve that which is of greater value.
Imitate the Genesis 31, and 33.
wisdom of the most holy Patriarch Jacob, who returning out of Mesopotamia,
and being to receive and entertain his brother, whom he greatly feared, sent
before his sheep, oxen, and camels, with all his substance: after them he
placed both his mayds and their children: after them Leah and her children: but
Rachel and Joseph, as most precious and estimable treasures he ordered in the
last and safest place: signifying that he had rather hazard all the rest, then
those two, whom he so much esteemed. Tell me O thou servant of God, what have
thou in ye world, which thou art so much to regard, as this Rachel and Joseph?
What is Rachel, but a contemplative life? what is Joseph, but the spiritual
son, which is borne of her, which is innocence and purity of life? wherefore
that treasure is more to be esteemed, then the loss of any temporal thing: so
that thou must make account rather to lose these, then fail in the other.
Therefore my brother, hap what will, always keep with thee thy Rachel and thy
Joseph. Do not imitate them, who have prayers, exercises, and spiritual
things for a cloak and color of their negligence, who when they are to do,
or lose any thing, they always expose the spiritual thing to the danger,
that they may keep and defend the temporal.

I knew a godly religious woman, who as often as she heard the sound of the
hour, in which she was wont to pray, at that very same time (as it is also
reported of those holy Fathers of Egypt) all An example of excellent Devotion.
other things being set aparte without delay she betook her to her exercise.
When she conferred with an other godly woman, with whose conversation she was
greatly delighted forthwith after she heard the stroke of the passed hour,
she departed from her, abruptly breaking off her speech, saing: If to day I
shall omit mine ordinarye task for this cause, to morrow I shall omit it for
an other, (for every day brings his hinderance) and still so proceeding, I
shall commit a thousand errors. At another time the same devout woman being
with me, the like circumstances fell out, where at her departure from me she
showed no token of vanitye, but of great edifying: so that scarcely three times
in a year she fails in this her most holy exercise. I have brought this
example for the benefit of those that be negligent, but I dare not remember
the fruit, that she obtained by this perseverance. For these times and days
wherein we live, are so envious, and so full of iniquitye, that they will not
abide that the virtues of the living should be published: as the examples of
many Saints do testifye.

There is not any thing in ye world, ye more speedily brings a man to the
height and top of perfection, then this continuance and perseverance, as well
in the exercises of Prayer, as in the diligence and order of his life: for a
traveler that every day goes forward a little, A Simily.
if he persevere and continue in his progress, soon comes to the end of his
journey. but if he fail and faint in it, and a little after begin his voyage a
new, consumes all his life in it neither ever comes to the end of his journey.

But if at any time a casualty happen, which cannot be refused in this life, so
that thou do stumble and fall, and through weakness do faint, do not
discourage thy self, nor cast away thy hope: but albeit thou fall a thousand
times in a day, rise again and be converted a thousand times in a day: and in
what place thy thread was broken, knit it together aagaine, do not go back
to the beginning, for if thou do, thou shall disturb all thy work and
labor.

Neither only is constancy The exercises are not to be changed.
needful in the very exercises themselves: but also in the manner of them. For
there be some, that do not fail in their daily task: but daily change their
intent and purpose: to day they go this way, and to morrow that: and thus
being unstable and unstayed in their affections, they remain constant in
nothing.

Sometimes they begin of the Passion: a little after they leave it and take
unto themselves another Meditation, and another exercise.

Sometimes they clymbe up into heaven, relinquish sacred humanytie, and ascend
to the highness and sublimity of Divinity. Some leave all these, and begin of
the memory of their sins: so that they never prosecute the thing taken in
hand, and never come to the end of their diet, to which without doubt they had
sooner come, if they had perseuered in the same way, albeit it was not so
direct nor compendious.

It happens unto these as to hunting dogs, who follow A Simily.
two Hares, and take neither: the tree hardlye increases, that is often
trans-planted: and the wound is slowlyer healed, when the medicines are often
or daily altered.

Seeing that there are many and sundry ways, by which man goes unto GOD,
and many manners of considerations, by which the spirit is lifted up unto
him: let every one ponder with him self, which is the best fitting for his
purpose, and let him entertayne and follow that: for that is the best course
that he can take.

But let him beware that he does not fall into the error of many, who when
they have found God in some one exercise, they deny that there is any other
way, but that alone: which is nothing else, but to deny that there be more
ways, by which we go unto GOD: when as the holy Ghost, who is our leader and
Captain, does lead every one by his own way, which he sees to be most
commodious and convenient for him.

THE ELEVENTH thing that increases Devotion, is the time, and such like
circumstances. CHAP. XIIII.
MVch do they avail, which before we have spoken of, as the time, the place,
the disposition, and the corporal fashion and form of him, that prays, with
other circumstances, every one of which are as pricks to stir up devotion,
especially in nouices and young beginners: who as they are not altogether
spiritual, so have they greater need of the help and aid of corporal things,
that their hearts may be lifted up unto God.

The fittest and most convenient time of Prayer is midnight, as Bernarde says
in a certain Sermon: Bern. in his 30. Sermon upon the Cant.
the resting and withdrawing time, says he, is the aptest and fittest, but
especially when as the night sleep does bring dead and deep silence, then the
Prayer is powered forth more freely and more purely: Arise in the night, says
the Prophet, in the beginning Lament. 2.
of the Watches power out thy heart like water before the face of the lord. How
safely thy prayer ascends in the night, God alone being thy judge, and his
holy Angel thy witness, who undertakes to present ^t upon the high altar? How
acceptable and welcome is it, having the pleasing tincture of ruddye
shamefastnes?

How quiet and peaceable being disturbed with no clamor, nor noise: to be
brief, how pure and sincere, being soyled with no dust of earthly carefulnes:
being tempted with no praise or flattery of the beholder? For this cause
therefore the spouse no less shamfastly, then warilye sought for the secret
couerture both of the bed, and of the night: to pray, that is, desiring to
find her love. This says Saint Bernard.

They that cannot rise at midnight, let them endeavor to rise a little before
the rising of the Sun, as the Wise man admonishes: We ought, says he, to
prevent the Wisedo. 16
Sunrising to give thanks unto thee, and to salute thee before the day spring.
In the morning the Children of Israel gathered that delicate Manna, having in
it that most exellent taste of sweetness. Dau^ says in many Psalms, that he
rose in the morning to praise God. Of the righteous it is said; That betimes in
the morning his heart watches ^le. 30.
for the Lord, who made him and he pomreth forth his prayers in the sight of
the highest. In the morning in the falling of the heavenly dew, the grace of
the holy Ghost descends also into their hearts, who meditate on GOD, by the
which they may be defended from the heat of the Sun, and from the plague that
destroys at noone day. To be brief, this time is so convenient to attend
upon the Lord, that the Wise man being delighted with this oportuniye, said:
He rises well in the morning that seeks for good things, or the Prou. 2.
chiefest good. For this time of all times in the day, is the conuenientest and
fittest to talk with God, and to deal in the business of our salvation: for
then all the powers and faculties of our fowls are more cheerful and ready,
and better prepared for this duty. Our sight is not so wandering, our stomach
empty, our head refreshed with sleep, the time quiet, and the heart free and
fasting from the cogitations and business of the day.

A short supper, and a hard bed are good means for early rising: Good means
for early rising.
they make the sleep shorter, and the time of prayer longer. But a large
supper, and a soft bed work the contrary: for when much is to be digested, much
sleep must be had, and the softer the bed is, the more unwillingly it is left.

But when as either for age, or for infirmity, or for presence of friends, or
society, a man cannot rise at that hour, yet let him not omit to watch a
little, and to meditate in his heart of those things that belong unto God. For
it is not absurd in such necessitye to make an oratory of thy bed, as that
holy Prophet did, who said: I cause my bed every night to Psalm. 6.
swim, and water my couch with tears. For as it is not inconvenient to sit
praying, when as the weakness of the body will not suffer any other way: so
neither is it absurd to lie and pray in bed, when as necessity, or urgent
reason does constrain it. Let thy soul be bended and prostrated before the
presence of God: and let thy body have that form and fashion, it may have:
for that the best composition of the body, which does not hinder devotion. If
it may be, let the man that is weak be half clothed, that he may sit in his
bed, if so be his weakness be so great that he cannot rise.

It very much helps morning prayer, if a man before he go to sleep does
somewhat give himself to prayer: for in the morning he shall find in his
heart the fruit of that seed, which he sowed the night before. Therefore that
man does A Simily.
very well, that always goes to bed with some holy Meditation in his mind,
as he that at night covers the coals in the ashes, that in the morning when
he ryseth, he may the more easily make a fire. And to preserve this fire the
better, it is profitable, that as often at thou awakest in the night, forth
with to lift up thine heart to God, saying. Glory be to the Father, etc. or
some such like verse; for this shall very much help not only to this which we
speak of, but also to drive away vain fancies and wanto^ thoughts which are
sent of the devil: for at this time he is wont to be more busy about a man,
then at other times.

Wherefore Saint Hierome says, that even to the holy and sanctified bed of
David, which every night he had wont to water with his tears, the devil had
access with all the pomp of his pleasure's

In the morning, when we a wake, As soon as we awake we must think of God.
as soon as we open our eyes, let our hearts be powered forth in the
remembrance of God, before any other cogitation does possess them: for then
the soul is so tender, and so well disposed, that it presently assumeth the
first thought, which is offered: and apprehends it so firmly, that it can
hardly be removed from it, or receive any other.

Therefore it is necessary, that we have recourse to the good seed, least the
evil seed possess the ground of our hearts. Of such weight is this
counsel, that the business of the whole day depends of this moment. For thi^
being ordered after this manne^ the morning prayer shall be more fervent and
devout: and undoubtedly as the morning prayer i^ such shall be the whole course
o^ the day: according to that, which is written in the book of Job If thou will early seek unto God^ and pray to the Almighty: if tho^ Job. 8.
be pure and upright, then surely h^ will awake up unto thee, and he wi^ make
the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

In like manner a place close an^ solitary, is the fittest for prayer: for A
place fit for prayer.
our lord in the night went out into desert places to pray, not that h^ had
any need thus to prepar^ himself, or to seek opportunity but that he might
give us an example what we ought to do. For (...) closeness and obscurity had
no much profited, that the heart by he eyes should not wander, Saint Anthony
had not blamed the Su^, when it rose: for by the bright^es of his beams it
hindered the ^xed atte^tiuenes of his co^te^platio^.

The disposition also of the body does bring much help, to the A fit
disposition of body is to be kept in prayer.
^fting up of the spirit, and to stir ^p devotion. Our Savior (albe^t he
needed not) sometime prai^d unto his father, lying prostrate upon the earth:
sometime his eyes ^ifted up to heaven. Such a like thing is read of S. Martin,
who ^ying said: Suffer me to lift up ^ine eyes to heaven, that my spirit may
directly go unto the lord. Cassianus writes of the Fathers of Egypt, that
oftentimes in the mid of their morning prayers, they ^rostrated the^selus upon
the earth, with admirable devotion worshipping the Lord: and forthwith with
great alacraty they raised up themselves, that it seemed not so much the easing
and refreshing of their bodies, as the adoration and reverence of the divine
Majesty.

According to these examples, he that prays, ought sometimes to use such like
iestures and ceremonies, that his heart with greater facility may be lifted up
to God: seeing that we see that no mean fruits are derived from it.

It is good for a man sometimes with lowly humility of spirit to prostrate
himself upon the earth, adoring with all the blessed spirits that infinite and
incomprehensible Majesty, who casting down their crowns before the throne of
God and the Lamb: give glory unto God, and acknowledge Apoc. 4.
that whatsoever they have, they received it from him.

When we pray we ought also to Ceremonies in prayer are not to be reprehended.
lift up our eyes toward heaven, which ceremonies, seeing that our Savior
himself so oftentimes used, they ought not to be reprehended, but observed, as
examples left unto us of our Master and Teacher. For albeit God is present
every where, yet heaven is his proper place, in which he does those works,
which he does not in other places.

Here the reader is to be admonished, that it is not always necessary to pray
with be^ded knees, seeing that by this means our devotion is often times
hindered, by reason of the griese and weakness of the body. True it is, yt it is
good to suffer some affliction in prayer, seeing that the Lord in his
sacrifice, suffered so great things for our sins: yet this is not the chiefest
fruit of prayer, for in comparison of the light, and sweetness of virtue, which
god bestows in prayer, the grief of the body, and corporal exercise seem
very small. Therefore in the time of prayer let the composition and ordering of
thy body be such, as may be both for thy health, and that thy soul may be
quiet, and fixed upon god alone; especially when the time of thy prayer is
longer, that is, of two or three hours, (as it is the custom of some) seeing
that few are found, who are able to bear so long pain and grief, without
diminishing and abating of devotion, which is especially required in this
exercise.

I know and confess that al these things are not of any such special
conseque^t: yet they are co^ducent and auailable to our purposed end. For even
as rhetoritia^s, that would co^pile and frame a perfect oration, are not content
with teaching the matters themselves alone, which are the very strength and
sinews of the oration: but also they use other manner of variations, which are
not of the substance of the oration: as apt structure and composition, fit
concourse and conioyning of vowels and consonants, tropes, schemes, figures,
etc. For these make the oration perfect and absolute: so also we frame and form
here an other oration celestial and heavenly, which we are to declaime in the
presence of the divine majesty: it is meet therefore, that we should omit
nothing, whether it be much, or little, which is conducent unto the essence and
perfection of it: especially seeing that there is nothing in this kind of
discipline, which ought to be called small or little.

THE TWELVETH thing, which stirs up Devotion, is corporal austeritie, or
exercise. CHAP. XV.
BEside al those things, which hitherto we have spoken of, afflictions and
corporal troubles and greeuances are profitable to excite and stir up
Devotion: as are fasting, discipline, vnsoft and rowgh apparel, watching, a
hard bed, and sober and slender diet. Frist because such exercises are
fomentations and nourishers of Prayer and Devotion: Secondly because they are
pillars and bases, on which they lean: Thirdly, for the common rule: which is,
that A common rule.
God does bestow his grace upon every one, as he is fit to receive it. For none
can deny, but that he is more fit and better disposed, who prepares himself
together both in spirit and body, then he that only prepares himself in
spirit.

We must here know, that there are two ways of preparing and Two ways of
preparing our solues unto prayer.
disposing our selves to receive grace: one false, the oeher true. The false
way is, when as a man only in word, and with a luke warm desire does seek for
God, without the true and internal sighing and sobbing of the soul. And this
is the reason, why many do seek for God, and do not find him: do ask, and
not receive. And in this slender and cold desire they always live and never
find God: because they seek him not with all their heart, as he ought to be
sought of them, who desire to find him, according to that of the Prophet. Ye
Ier. 29.
shall seek me, and find me, because ye shall seek me with all your heart.
This is the second way of disposing and preparing our selves, which here the
Prophet notes: that is, when we seek for God, with a true and in ward desire,
and with labor and affliction of heart. Of which God speaks by his Prophet
Joel, saying. Turn you unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with
weeping, Rael. 2.
and with mourning: and rent your heart, and not yourclothes, and turn unto the
lord your god. In which place we are to note, yt as the evil which outwardly
appears not, either is not seen, or is not an evil indeed, or very small: so
ye inward affliction of the spirit, except it outwardly break forth, and does
also afflict the body, is either feined, or very small. But that which does so
mightily afflict ye spirit, that it does also afflict the body, that istruly
and indeed worthy to be called affliction, and of this the Prophet speaks.

He that seeks god with such an affection, let him assure himself, yt God
will not hide himself from him, but will be found of him. So the Ninevites
sought him, when they fasted, mourned, and were clothed Iomas. 3.
with sackcloth: wherefore at the length they found him. So the Prophet Daniel
sought him, as he testifies of himself:

At the same time, says he, I Dani. 10.
Daniell was in heaviness for three weeks of days, I eat no pleasant bread,
neither came flesh, in my mouth, neither did I (...) myself at al, till three
weeks of days were fulfilled. Which time being finished, he faith that an
Angel appeared unto him in a terrible shape, whom in the same place, he
describes among other things saying: Fear not daniel: for from the first day
that thou did set thine heart to understand and to humble thyself before
thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. See how plainly
in this place the Scriture testifies, what devout prayer can do, when as
corporal affliction is joined unto it.

We read of that holy Evangelical sinner, that being drowned Ioh. 20.
as it were with tears, she sought the Lord in the Sepulcher: wherefore she
received comfort before all others, because before al other, she sought the
Lord with great affection.

But what do I speak of tears so godly, when as the sackcloth of perverse
and wicked King Achab, could so move the divine eyes and breast, as to revoke,
or at the least to defer the sentence denounced against him and his house?

To be brief, as often as the Scripture remembers that the children of Israel
mourned, fasted, and cried unto God, it adds, that they were heard, and
delivered from the danger they were in: whereby it most manifestly apeereth,
that these are great helps to find God. Whereupon a School man says, that
almost no grace descends into the soul of man except it ^e by prayer,
affliction, and corporal tribulation.

There are many kinds of afflictions Whence the grief of the soul in prayer
aryseth.
and austerenes of life, most acceptable unto God and most convenient to obtain
grace by, which take their original from the great grief, which the soul
co^ceiueth, because she has offended so high and exelle^t a goodness, and also
from the impatient longing desire of the soul. These tears and afflictions,
which are derived from charity and humility are very acceptable unto GOD, as
testifies the Prophet, who says. The dead that ^ar. 2.
are in the graves, and whose souls are out of their bodies, give unto the
lord neither praise nor righteousness: but the soul that is vexed for the
greatness of sin, and he that goes crookedly, and weak, and the eyes that
fail, and the hungry soul will give thee praise and righteousness, O Lord.

The pitiful and fatherly heart of god does not long suffer the soul
afflicted with the love and longing for of her spouse, to be disconsolate, and
destitute of comfort: but does help her, and minister consolation unto her.
When as the mother sees her child weeping, and desiring gugawes with tears,
her heart cannot brook that the request of her child should be long deferred,
and that he should be hurt with weeping; but forthwith she gives him that he
desires, and for which he wept. What then will he do, that offered himself
for Israel with far greater affection, then that of the mother, who says:
Though the Esaias. 49.
mother forget her child of her womb yet will I not forget thee. What will he
do, if he does not open the breast of his grace, and the bosom of his mercy,
and fill us full, who says: Ye shall suck at my Esaias. 66.
breasts, ye shall be born upon mysides, and be joyful upon my knees. After this
manner they must seek for the divine grace: who would find it: and if they
thus seek for it, they shall be sure to find it. For Solomon does often
promise this in his Proverbs: as when he says, Pro. 8.
thr^ they at the length shall find Wisdom, who daily watch at her gates,
and give attendaunce at the poastes of her doors: insinuating by this manner
of speaking, that he that would find her, must seek her as she is to be sought:
but he seeks her as she is to be sought, who seeks her, not only with the
desire of spirit, but also with the labor and affection of the body. And here
we must be circumspect and wary that all these things be done with wisdom and
discretion.

THE WORKS OF mercy are the thirteenth and last thing that increase Devotion.
CHAP. XVI.
THE works of mercy besides their fruit do also bring much aid and help unto
devotion. For albeit at a blush they seem to make the soul less fervent, by
reason of the sundry businesses which happen in exercising them* yet they
bring none other hurt, ^hen that water is wont to bring, which is sprinkled up
on an hot glowing gad of iron, which altho^gh A Simily.
it seem to cool the hot bur^ing iron, yet at the length it cau^th it to
burn the more vehe^ently. For as God is faithful, and (...) friend of mercy,
and gracious to ^ose that are merciful: so also is ^e careful that his
faithful and reli^ious servant be not hindered in ^is prayer, who rises from
the ta^e, that he may minister unto the ^eed of his neighbor. Therefore ^e
Angel said to Tobias: Prayer good with fasting and alms: it is Tob. 12.
^tter to give alms, then to lay up ^lde. For those which exercise alms (...)
righteousness, shall be filled with ^e. And a little after; When thou ^dst pray
with tears and did bury ^e dead, and did leave thy dinner to ^de the dead
in thy house in the day time, and to bury them in the nigh^ I did present thy
prayer before the Lord. Neither ought tho^ only to prefer the necessity
(...) charity before corporal meat^ but also (if need be) before spiritual.
For as Barnarde says, h^ that leaves spiritual consolation that he may
relieve his neighb^ so often as he does this, so often spiritually he lays
down h^ soul for him. And this is after (...) certain manner to be seperat^
from Christ for the brethren: it Romans 9.
for a time to be separated from the conversation, and sweet fe^lowship of
Christ, that the br^thren may be benefitted. The that are separated from Christ
after this manner, at the length ^ceiue all blessings, together greater
abundance. For God the length does measure vn^ them by their own measure,
(...) being merciful unto them, who ^ue showed mercy to their ^ighbors, and
fed their bodies, ^cording to that of Solomon. The Pro 11.
^erall person shall have plenty: and (...) that waters, shall also have ^ine.

^F THOSE THINGS that hinder Devotion. CHAP. XVII.
^Eeing that we have ple^tifully spoken of those things, which stir (...)
and increase Devotion: order re^ireth, that we also speak of those ^ngs, which
are wont to hinder it: ^t every way, and on every side we ^y succor and help
the studies, and ^ercises of Godly and well disposed ^n.

OF THE FIRST IMpediment and hindrance of Devotion, which is sin.
THe chief and principal impediment, which now we will speak of, is sin:
neither only that which ye world is commonly ashamed of, as being gros^ and
heinous, but also that, which for the most part, men make (...) conscience nor
scruple to co^mit^ as esteeming it small and of no reckoning.

Of the first we will not speak^ of in this place, because no man doubts, but
that it hinders a^ good in the soul: but we w^ only entreat of the second,
because it is the property of these sins also to cool charity, an^
therefore to extinguish the he^ of Devotion.

Therefore it is requisite and behooueful that a devout man make continual war
with this kind of sins, which albeit they seem small, yet they are not to
be accounted so, seeing that God has forbidden them.

For as it is very well said of Saint Hierome, we must not only look what is
commanded, but also who it is, that commands, that is, God; who as
undoubtedly he is not small, so has he given no small commandment, albeit
there is a difference between the commandments: seeing also we are not
ignorant, that in the day of judgment we must render (...) reason of every
idle word. For ^e that fears God, neglects ^ot any thing, although it be
^mall.

Furthermore we must have a regard, that there ought be great purity in the
soul, into which God powers the most precious ointment of Devotion: for a
precious stone is not enclosed or set in earth, but in gold: neither does God
put his Soueraygne balm, but into a pure soul, clean and free from filthy
and enormous corruption. Therefore it is necessary that a man have always in
his hand a ra^ging siffe, or a fine boulter, that he may well sift and boult
over all his actions, and diligently view, with what intent, and how he does
a^ things, that in all things h^ may be pure from vanity an^ sin.

Their opinion is diligently to be eschewed and avoided who are wont to say:
the sin is not unpardonable n^ heinous, therefore it is of no great moment,
if it be committed.

What woman will say to her husband; I will not be an evil wife unto thee,
neither will I pollute thy marryage bed: yet in other things I will do, as
pleases me, although I shall know that I shall displease thee?

Who would or could dwell with such a woman? Such surely are they, that of
great and vast sins make a conscience, but of little make no reckoning
Ecclesiasticus says, that he that makes small account of little things,
shall fall by little and little.

As a living body, not only fears death, but also Feauers, Wounds, yea and
^he Itche, and Scabbes also albeit they be small: so a soul, that lives in
grace, not only fears and abhors gross and heinous sins, but also
those, that seem of lesser moment and do make way and entrance to those that
be grosser.

Therefore he that seriously studieth and endeavors to attain devotion, he
must avoid and eschew all sin, as well that which seems less, as that which
is greater, that he may lift up pure hands in prayer, and that the fervor of
Charity may always live in him.

THE SECOND IMPEdiment is the remorse of conscience. CHAP. XVIII.
AN impediment contrary to the former is too much scrupulositie and too much
grief, and anxiety of heart, which some do conceive by reason of the sin,
they have fallen into. For this oftentimes does bring more harm then the sin
it self. For seeing that it is the property of sin to bring remorse and
sting of conscience, there are some so subject to this evil, that their hearts
are filled with exceeding bitterness, heaviness and grief; neither can they now
enjoy that Divine sweetness and quiet, which Prayer requires.

Furthermore seeing that sin is like unto deadly poison, which speedyly
pearceth the heart, kills the spirits, and brings death, there be some,
that falling into a sin, are forthwith so vanquished in mind that they lose
all their inward strength, which before they had attained to work well.

For as there is nothing, which does more stir us up unto good, then the
vigor and strength of the heart, so there is nothing, which does more
extinguish heat and fervor in us, then the weakness and fainting of the same.

For this cause the Holy Fathers in the wilderness were wont in times past to
admonish their Disciples, that they should always stand armed with this
courage and fortitude of mind, for by this means a man as it were leaning on
a strong staff, is prepared and ready to all things which are to be done:
but to him that faynteth or casts down his courage, the contrary happens.

Wherefore it is the common opinion of many, that more, receive greater harm of
an indiscreete estimation of sin, then of the sin it self.

This indiscreete remorse of Whence too much remorse of conscience arises.
conscience does sometimes spring and arise from faint-hartednes: and sometimes
from a certain secret pride, which closely persuades a man that he is some
body, and therefore ye he ought not to fall into such a defect: to whom humility
pro^pteth the contrary: to whom it is no marvel if there be slidings into many
defectes; for humility has always set before her eyes her own weakness, and
does meditate on it.

This faint-hartednes also is sometimes derived from hence, that a man does not
know the grace and efficacy of the redemption of Christ, nor the virtue of the
medicine, which he has left unto us in his death and passion for the healing
of this defect, and remedying of this fear.

Therefore let this be the first The first remedy against too much
scrupulositie.
remedy against this evil, to know the Lord, and the price, and virtue of
his merits, least we at anytime cast away the hope of the Divine mercy, whether
it be in great sins, or in little.

Saint John does cherish this hope, when he says: My babes 1. Ioh. 2.
these things write I unto you, that ye sin not: and if any man sin, we
have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Just. And he is the
reconcilation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins
of the whole world.

What diffidence and distrust can then hurt or annoye thee, being shadowed
with these wings, and covered with the merits of so great an intercessour?
All the sins in the world, if they be compared with the merits of Christ,
are nothing else, but a little light chafe cast into the fire.

Why then dooest thou discourage thy self, seeing that such satisfaction, and
so great merits are so liberally and freely offered unto thee?

Thou will say, because I offend every day, and every ^ower, neither do I
at any time amend my self. Tell me, ^f Christ should daily suffer for thy
sins, which thou daily committest; is there any reason that thou should
despair? Thou will aunsweare, Noe: Therefore assuredly persuade thy self,
that that death so long ago performed is no less profitable, theu if it
weredayly offered: for the Apostle says, that that high Priest by one
oblation, Heb. 10.
which he offered upon the Cross, has cleansed and sanctified us for ever:
he has left that in his Sacrifice for us, that it may be a perpetual
medicine and treasure unto us.

Thou will object again, and say: I offend and sin daily, albeit God daily
powers and heapeth his blessings and graces upon me, therefore I cannot but
distrust, and fall from hope.

I tell thee in veritye and truth, that as nothing can be found that does more
manifest the malitiousnesse of man, then that manner of multiplying sins,
when as the Divine benefittes are incessantly powered upon him: so also there is
nothing found, wherein the greatness of the Divine goodness does more
appear, then in this, that God does without ceasing shower down his
benefittes upon him, that blusheth not without ceasing to offend him.

Our sins says Paul, do manifest the Divine goodness: for neither in
Heaven, nor in Earth, nor among Fowls, nor Fishes, neither in Herbs nor
Flowers, does the Nobleness and brightness of the bowels and mercy of God
more excel^entlye shine, then in this, that he suffers and forgiueth By the
multitude of sins the goodness of God is known.
sins.

For if wisely and prudentlye thou know to use the dangerous and pernicious
taste of sin, as some poison, thou may make a medicine of it, by ascending
up from it to that supreme goodness, which with so great benignity suffers thy
sins, albeit they are so many, and so great, that thou who committest them
art not able to bear them, and although thou art wearye in bearing them, yet
God is not wearye in pardoninge of them.

Therefore let the bitter pills be gilded over with the honnye of this
consideration, that the too much bitterness which is in them, may not be
tasted. Which if it be done, thou shall manytimes taste greater sweetness by the
consideration of this goodness, then bitterness by the meditation of thine own
wickedness. Wherefore in this case thou must do that, which a faithful servant
does, who albeit he be rude and negligent, yet he has a good and gracious
Lord, if he commit a fault; on the one side he begins to tremble for his
offense, but on the other side he remembers that he has a Lord full of
clemency, who so often has pardoned his offenses, thereupon he hops, that
with the same clemency he was wont to forgive his former trespasses, he will
also now wink at these present. Therefore when he does call to mind these
things, he turns the fear and grief, which the memory of his sins brought
forth, into joy, which he feels by the consideration of the goodness of his
Lord. Thy consideration ought to be like this, as often as too much sorrow for
thy sins does afflict and oppress thee: for thou doing this, of poison thou
shall make for thy self a preservative and a remedy against poison, and thou
shall pull out the eyes of thine enemy, and kill him with his own sword, and
thou shall take occasion of greater strength and courage of those same things,
which were wont to be the causes of greater fear and trembling. If thou draw
thy water through this channel, thou shall water two excellent virtues, charity
and humility: whilst of the sin, into which thou did fall, thou take
occasion to humble thy self, more manifestly acknowledging thine own misery:
and to love him with a more ardent love, upon whose goodness thou do so
greatly trust, and certainly perswadest thy self that he will pardon and
forgive thy sins.

Furthermore we are to know, Two kind^ of sins.
that there are two kind of sins, greatly differing between themselves. For
there be some that sin vnwillinglye against their purpose and deliberation, of
very weakness or negligence; or of the inclination, and evil habit, which
remains in the soul, oftentimes drawing a man unto evil, before he be aware.
Others are of a larger conscience, who if they abstain from gross and heinous
sins, they make no conscience of those that be smaller, neither have they any
purpose to avoid the^: but they will eat, drink, walk and talk, that they
may spend and pass away the time, by which things they consume much time
unprofitably, and often fall into many sins, which can very hardly be avoided
in so great security and idleness of mind. These, as long as they continue in
this mind, shall never attain remission of sins, for they have no true
purpose to lead an upright life, but rather to continue in dissolute living.

It cannot be denied, but that such like men live in great danger: for he that
has not a good and true purpose to prevail, and overcome all sins, he
lives in great danger of damnation. For even as he that lies in the midst of
a swift river, if he does not labor to take fast footing, and raise up his
body, is in danger to be borne down, and swallowed up of the water: so in
this spiritual life, which is like a deep and dangerous river, he lives in
many ieopardies of falling, who with tooth and nail does not labor ^o
profit and go forward in it. They that offend after the first manner, that is
(as we have said) either of forgetfulness, or of lack of good heed taking,
these more easily return unto themselves, and obtain pardon: for it is not in
^he power of man, although he ^e perfect, to eschew and avoid all kind of
sins: for as the wiseman says, the righteous man fal^eth seven times in a
day, and so often Prou. 24.
rises again. And Saint Augustine says: Not the holiest man De Dogmat. Eccl.
^s without sin: neither for this does he leave to be a righteous and a holy
man, seeing that in his affection and purpose he preserves and retains
sanctity.

The Apostle willing to signify unto us these, and other differences of sin,
says, That upon 1. Cor. 3.
the foundation of the Church, which is Christ, some do build gold, silver,
precious stones; others timber, hay, and stubble: and that every man's work
shall be made manifest. For the day of the Lord, says he, shall declare it,
because it shall be revealed by the fire: and the fire shall try every man's
work of what sort it is. They that have builded gold, silver, and precious
stones, they have no cause to fear the fire: but they that have builded timer,
hay and stubble: their works cannot but burn: yet so, that the timber does
burn longer then hay, and hay then stubble, which is consumed in the
twinkling of an eye.

We have drawn out this discourse the longer, that we might minister
effectual medicines and remedies unto those that are faint-hearted, and do
despair. But because man is a creature so blind and weak, that often^mes he
makes of a medicine ^oyson, and knows not so to ^unne one extreme, that he
fall ^ot into an other; it seems ^ood unto me here in the end ^f this
Chapter to admonish, that ^his plaster is not ordained nor ^ade for them, who
are too ^old and confident, but for those that be faint-harted and
distrust^ull. Therefore if an audatious and presumptuous man take this, ^e
shall do none other thing, the^ ^f he took a confection made for ^he health of
a cold man, and ^se it for the recovery of a hot man.

Neither do we here teach that weakelings and those that be faint-hearted
should always abstain from grief and remorse of conscience for sin, which
is as a wholesome shamefastness and correction, whereby we are held back, that
we do not fall into the same again: but so we teach, that they might not
disturb the peace of their hearts, which is the center and place, in which God
rests. Grief for sin is good, but it must have a moderation, least it
run into one of the extremes. Therefore the Apostle exhorts the
Corinthians, that they should comfort him that was penitent; not because he
esteemed heaviness and sorrow for sin unprofitable or evil, which in that place
he commends by many reasons, but least that penitentiary should be swallowed
up with too much heaviness, and least he should despair, who was so afflicted.
And this is that, which we teach in this place.

HE THIRD IMPEdiment is too much scrupulosity or anxiety. CHAP. XIX.
^N like manner the scruples, (...) which do arise of sins, are wont ^ightely
to hinder devotion, by ^eason of the great unquietness, which they bring with
them. For ^ose that be scrupulous and ten^er of conscience are always sad and
heavy, they wither and pine away themselves, whether they ^eeld and agree unto
sin, or not ^eelde: or whether they pray or ^ot pray: and so in other like
mat^ers, which exceedingly hinder and ^isturbe the peace and tranquilli^y of
the heart, in which god dwel^eth. For if the bed, in which the ^eauenly spouse
lies be green and fresh flourishing, as it is said in the Canticles, how can
he re^ Cant. 1.
in a heart, that is ouergrowen with scruples and pensive cares, which are as
thorns and nettles? But because it is not sufficient to have said that the
scruples are to be taken away, unless a remedy be ministered against them,
therefore it is necessary that we speak as* well of the one, as of the other,
least this doctrine be halting and imperfect.

The causes of these scruples and Causes of scrupulosity and anxiety.
anxieties are diverse, as the remedies of them are sundry. For God sometimes
leaves this passion in his, as he does other griefs and tribulations, that by
them he might purge and cleanse his children from their dross, or that a more
excellent crown might be prepared and provided for them. And therefore there is
no greater consolation, or remedy that can ^ee given to these men, besides
that, which generally is wont to ^e given in all kind of troubles and
afflictions, of which medicines and remedies the whole Scripture is full.
Sometimes they arise ^f melancholy, which is a humor ^ffecting the imagination
and the ^ppetite with diverse passions of ^eauinesse and superfluous fear, from
which proceed diverse and sundry scruples and disquietnesse of conscience. When
this scrupu^osity arises from this melancho^icall humor, then the doctrine of
Hyppocrates (as says S. Hierome) is more profitable for thee, then that, which
can be delivered of us. Some scruples also take their original from self
love, and from that that men cannot distinguish between the thought of the
heart, and the consent of the will: and therefore it often happens, the they
take one for another, and the that they have grievously offended, when they
have not. For t^ too much love, by which a m^ embraces himself, causes, tha^
man mightily feared that, when he fears danger: and this too much love being
joined with ye foresai^ ignorance, oftentimes makes t^ fear where no fear
is, ofte^time^ also by the craft and subtiltye (...) the devil these scruples
and spicednes of conscience are stirre^ up, who when he cannot expe^ the fear
of God out of the soul^ of Christians, he makes them t^ abuse it, and to fear
not true dangers, but false and those that ar^ so only in show. So that if
he cannot dry up the vain of living water, which God does make to flow and
stream in our souls, he diligently labors that it may break forth in a
wrong place, that the wholesome plants of ver^ue may not be watered by it. This
was the craft of that cruel tyrant Holofernes, who besiedging ye ci^y of
Bethulia, when he could not ^rie up their fountains, he caused ^he conduit
pipes to be cut in sun^er, by which the water was con^ayed into the city, and
so the wa^er running an other way, was of ^o use unto the inhabitants.
Fur^hermore some become scrupu^ous, because they know not fully ^he goodness of
our god, nor that great desire, by which he thirsts after the salvation of
men, especi^lly of those, which seek after it. Wherefore they become very
in^rious to the divine goodness: never do they think that of God, which is to
be thought: but they ^eal with God, as with some crafty and malicious Judge, who
seeks cauils and forgeries, that he may deny justice unto the accused, These
are ignorant with what great desire God wishes the salvation of men, not
withstanding they know of the thirst that tormented him hanging upon the
Cross: which thirst more afflicted him, then the Cross it self: for he
complained not of the cross, but of the thirst. They less also understand,
what God chiefly desires of a man for his thanksgiving; that is, a heart
well disposed, and ready to bear al kind of tribulations, rather then to
offend God. For if a man would^ well understand this, and would find such a
purpose and resolution in himself, as by the grace (...) God they find, who
would no^ commit one sin for the gain (...) the whole world, he would not
(...) easily admit such scruples and anxieties: not being ignorant that he ^ath
in his soul a pledge of ami^y so rich, and the favor of God ^o plentifully.

Among other remedies, which Remedies against scrupulosity.
^re wont to be given against scru^ulosity, the first and principal is, ^u^bly
to submit himself to other ^ens judgment, and not to refuse to ^e governed by
others. For our Lord, who fails us not in neces^ary things, and who denies
to no ^reature, that which te^deth to his ^reseruation, he would have this
^emedye most effectual against ^his grief, ye is, when as man cannot govern
himself by his own reason, that he yield himself to be ruled ^y another
wisdom. For in such (...) state a man ought not to believe ^imselfe, because he
is mistrustful, neither ought he to be his own ^hisician, albeit he be
learned, because he is sick and weak.

It helps also to the cure of this grief, with all might and main to
endeavor, that no place be given to scruples and anxieties, neither that we
yield unto their suggestions. For as that is the best way to drive danger from
cattle, A Simily.
to keep them from feeding in dangerous places: so also it is needful that we
do, if we will drive away the dangers of a scrupulous heart: especially seeing
that we know that scruples are of that quality, that by the same way, we open
the gate to one, we open it also to others, so that a man may continue in this
scrupulositye all the days of his life.

It is a cause of scrupulositie, as we said before, not to know the difference
between thought and consent, but the one is taken to be as heinous as the
other, which is a notable collusi^n of the Devil. A sinful thought (...) not
so deadly, as the victory ^uer it is profitable, if it be forthwith expelled
by the fear of God, or the memory of Christ ^rucified, because an enemy is
^uerthrowen and subdued. But (...) the matter proceed so far, ^at a man
gives consent to his ^full thought, and determines ^ctually to effect it, if
time and ^lace be given, this is heinous (...) deed. And it is requisite to ^e
known, for such a consent is Deliber^tiue consent.
^thing so filthy, frequent, and ^mmon among all men, that e^ry man (if so he
will) may ea^y know, what is the difference ^etweene a simple thought, and a
^eliberatiue consent unto it: for that other thing is this, then ig^miniously
to deal with God ^d to make man being marked with the charecter of God to
rebel against him, and to viola^ his commandments.

There is an other degree mo^ Cogitatio morosa.
subtle then the sormer, whi^ the deuines call a peevish, oue^ thwarte, and
morose thought^ and it is a deliberatiue consent^ not in the act external, b^
in the delight of the inward^ thought: that is, when as a m^ of set purpose

wont to say^ albeit he does not drink in (...) Inn, yet he delights to b^

occasions of anxietye a^ scrupulosity.

These differences are exact^ (...) be known, that we may the ^etter avoid
scruples and mi^akings, but especially the latter, ^eing exceeding dangerous,
in ^ing both a deliberatiue consent ^ith delight, and a doubling both ^ith God
and man.

But because in this matter ma^ye nice subtilties were to be ^oode upon,
which scholasti^ll deuines do copiously han^e, I will only here speak that,
which one of them remembers, ^at this sin does not happen, ^t to a man
without a soul, ^at is, to him that lives without the fear of God, who,
al^eit he outwardlye cease from ^ne, yet he does not that for ^ods sake, or
in respect of con^ience, but in regard of ho^ur, of the woorlde, or his ^wne
proper commodity: For ^is man seeing he dare not offend publicly, he does
that he may, delighting himself with filthy and unclean thoughts, enjoying a
fantastical delight, and an imaginary pleasure, that after some manner he may
satisfy himself.

By these and such like endeavors and studies a man may be cured of his
scrupulosity: which albeit it seem incurable in some, yet it may be cured:
especially in those, that humbly submit themselves to others judgment: such we
see often cured, and restored to their right wits and former soundnes.

THE FOVRTH IMPEdiment is any other bitterness or heaviness of heart. CHAP. XX.
NOt only the irkesomenesse and heaviness of mind, which arises of scruples,
but generally every displeasure and bitterness of heart, which proceeds of
anger, pensiveness, or of any such like root, does bring great hinderance
unto devotion. For seeing that bitterness and sweetness are contrary, it is
certain that it is most difficult, yea impossible, that the bitterness of
sin, and the sweetness of devotion, (which is sweeter then all other
delicates of the soul) can remain together in one and the selfsame heart.
Wherefore Saint Augustine said: Thou see that thine ha^ is a vessel full of
gall: therefore if thou desire to fill it with honny, it is necessary that
tho^ first empty out all the gall. An^ the holy Apostle admonishes, that we
should purge, and ca^ out of our hearts all heaviness and bitterness: which
as they fight with charity, so also they extinguish all the fervor of it, and
the joy of devotion. The proper place, which God dwells in, is a mild and
peaceable soul: therefore it behooves v^ that we cast out all that disturbeth
that peace and tranquillity: least that heavenly guest depart out of it.
Therefore it is meet and requisite that we be always arme^ with a good
purpose, that we^ will not ever hereafter open the gate to any yrkesome or
bitte^ thought: and if by chance any^ break into our house, that we presently
with all speed cast it forth again: Casting, as the Prophet says, all our
care upon God, Psalm. 54.
and enlarging our hearts, to re^eaue and bear all kind of tri^ulation, with
a faith invincible and a hope undaunted.

THE FIFTH IMPEDIment is external comfort and sensual delight. CHAP. XXI.
THE four former impediments have a certain affini^y between themselves: for
either ^hey are sins, or such, as sins are ^ngendred of.

Now also let us add other, which although the differ somewhat from the
former, yet they ^re as hurtefull to the proc^dings of devotion, as the other.
Among which, the love and sweetness of comforts reaped by things external and
sensual, is not the least, which altogether shuts up the gate and
entrance to the love and sweetness of spiritual things. For as no man
calls a Chyrurgian to the house A Simily.
of a sound man, but to the house of him that is wounded: so God commonly
sends not his Spirit, who is called the comforter, to their houses, that
enjoy vain joy and comfort, but to the houses of them, that be desolate and
afflicted for his love. Give ye (says Solomon) strong drink The holy spirit
is not sent but to those that be desolate and afflicted. Prou. 31.
unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto them that have grief of
heart. Let him drink, that he may forget his poverty, and remember his miserye
noe more. Therefore to cure this grief, God ordained this medicine, which he
sends not to the house of the whole, but of the sick. Consolation, says
Barnarde, is a delicate and dainty thing; neither is it given to him, that
seeks it without God.

A wife, chaste and lawful, who A Simily.
deserves and is worthy to be loved alone, thinks an injury to be done unto
her, if she be loved together with others. So also does God: A figure of this
we have in Exodus: for Manna, which had so great sweetness in it, was Exodus 16.
not given to the Israelits in the wilderness, before the meal was spent, which
was brought out of Egypt: so neither shall that bread of Angels be given unto
man in this exile and banishment, until he has renounced all the delights and
comfort of this world.

Humane comfort is a very injurious stepdame, if any man take it in steed of
Divine consolation: therefore it is necessary that it be cast out of doors,
least perhaps it be an hindrance unto the other.

They do the contrary, who on the one side will partake of the divine
consolation and sweetness in Prayer: and afterward this exercise being ended
will enjoy worldly delights and pleasures: will eat and drink daintily, be
clothed sumptuously, and live in all wantonness and delicacy* to be brief
who will so enjoy God, that they will not loose nor forgo the vanitye and do
lights of the world. But let them certainly persuade themselves, that they
shall never profit in the way of the Lord, so long as they walk thus lamely
and haltingly.

Birds that do both swim and fly in the holy Scriptures are ^ounted
unclean. And what ^oe these birds signify unto ^s? Surely none other thing,
then ^he soul of a delicate and fleshly ^an, who will both swim in ^he river
of his own delights and pleasures, and contemplate upon Divine and high
mat^ers.

Let no man deceive himself: ^or as light and darkness cannot be together,
so neither ^an humane and Divine con^olations agree together.

In like manner the flesh and the spirit do strive and ^ght in the self
same man, and ^ee that will enjoy the good of ^he one, it is necessary, that
he ^id war and defiance unto the ^ther.

The Prophet David very well understood this, when he says, My soul refused
comfort (in earthly Psalm. 77.
matters) I did think upon my God, and I was delighted and prayed, and my
delight was so great, that my spirit fainted in me. Was this a good change: or
will thou say that the Prophet was herein deceived, when as he received for
so small and ridiculous comforts, so ample and large consolations, with which
his heart was so filled, that he could not bear the greatness of them?

This is the cause, why many come and sit by the fountain of these delights,
without any other delight in the world: for their souls are filled up to the
brinke with inward delights. God is Deuteronomy. 5.
jealous, and with exceeding great fervor does love our souls, as he himself
confesses: therefore he will not admit other delights and external loves,
neither will ^e that they should be mingled with his.

He therefore that would large^y enjoy Divine and heavenly co^solations; Let
him follow the counsel of Augustine; Let a man leave all things, that he may
receive all things: for he shall find all things in God: who leaves all
things for God.

THE SIXTH IMPEDIment is too much carke and care. CHAP. XXII.
THe contrary unto the impediment of delight and pleasure is this of too much
carke and care: yet no less hurtefull then that: for cares and pleasures (as
Christ says) are thorns, which Luke. 8.
choke the word of God. Wherefore not without cause it is said of The two roots
of all evil.
Saint Barnarde, that necessity and desire are the two principal roots of
all the evils that be in the world.

For all evils, that are committed in the world are done, either that
necessity may be avoided, which brings punishment, or that some delight may
be obtained, which procures joy. Therefore the cares of this necessitye
hinders as well the taste of Devotion, as the quiet of Prayer: for they do so
prick and pierce ye heart that they do not permit a man to think upon any
other thing, the^ of the cause from whence they spring: which always presses
and pricketh the heart, and knocks at the gate, neither desisteth, until it
obtain that it sought.

Who then can sleep, or rest in ^he midst of so many Flies, Waspes, and
Frogs, as are ^n the land of Egypt? Here sure^y that wish of the Bridegroom
^n the Canticles was to be desired, that the Spouse may en^oy this sweet
sleep of life, among so many and so diverse perturbations and disturbances of
things.

But thou will say; Will thou A remedy against superfluous cares.
give me any remedy, whereby I may either root out, or chooke these
increasing cares, which so greatly do toss and turmoile my heart? The
presentest remedy is, if with all endeavor thou studiest (as much as is
possible) to with draw thy mind from all sensual love of things created,
for from this love all cares do proceed, as we have showed before. Therefore if
thou will cease, or rather banish al afflicted thoughts, and careful
pensiuenes, labor to mortify and kill in thee all external and foreign
loves. And although many things are required that thou may live in this life
without carking and caring, yet they may all be contained in this short
sentence. Do not love, and thou shall not be afflicted: neither be delighted
in the creatures, but as God has willed. Believe me where this has place,
there true delight has place: a grievous tax is set upon them, that have
their love and delight set upon the creatures, and much greater are the
sorrows of the bringing forth, then of the conception.

An other remedy is: if we cast all our cares upon God: hoping most assuredly,
that God will dispose all things after the best ^anner, if we commit them unto
^im: for he has commanded that we should refer all our bu^nes unto him,
and that it should ^e our only care, how we may ^eep his commandments. So
^id the Spouse in the Canticles; Wherefore she says, I am my wel^eloueds, Cant.
6.
and my well-beloved is mine: ^e is mine to procure and provide ^r me all
necessaries: and I am ^is to do whatsoever pertains (...) his worship and
service: by which words is insinuated, that if ^an will wholly apply himself
^to the worship of his creator, ^at he in like manner will be ^holy occupied
in supplying the ^ants and needs of his creatures. ^or the law of God is called

When did he fail of his promise? With this embassage only a certain holy
Father was wont to send abroad his brethren to preach the word, that they might
atte^d their business with safety and securitye, saying; Cast thy burden upon
the Psalm. 55.

diverse other.

which is not found infinitely ^ore excellent in the Creator? (...) much greater
is the faithfulness ^f God then the faithfulness of man, (...) his goodness is
more excellent ^en the goodness of man.

And if the faithfulness of man stretch thus far, how far I pray thee shall
the faithfulness of God reach? Follow in all things, and in all thy businesses
and thoughts the counsel of Saint Angustine, who says; Cast thy self upon
the Lord, and fear not, that he will hurt thee, or that he will permit thee
to fall: but he will nourish thee, heal thee and save thee.

THE SEVENTH Mpediment is the multitude of businesses, especially of studies
and contemplative speculations. CHAP. XXIII.
AS cares and anxieties of Spirit do comber and disturb devotion, so also the
occupatio^ and labors of the body, when ^hey are too much, do let and ^inder
it: for those do oppress ^he spirit, that it is hardly able to ^ray: these
do steal away the ^me, that it has no space to ^ray: so that these two
impe^iments do bring it to pass, that a man has neither time, nor spirit to
attend upon this exer^ise.

And albeit all external occu^ations and businesses do en^ender and beget
this impedi^ent, yet especially the business ^f study and learning does effect

^heory and speculation. For this ^heory, and speculation of the vn^erstanding

virtue ^d juice of the soul; makes it desolate and leaves a pleasure so dry
and whithered, that it neither tastes nor feels God. For other occupations
and businesses, which are simply corporal, The labors of the hands do less
hurt and hinder Devotion, then the endeavors of ^he understanding.
as are to dig to delue, or to do any such like thing, do not hinder so
greatly the handling of those things, that belong unto Devotion. So the
Fathers in the wilderness did exercise tillage and husbandry and made baskets,
wa^ling of houses, and mats of wickers and osiers yea singing and praying. The
occupations and businesses of the understanding do ill agree with those of the
will: unless they be so ordered, that they may serve for this exercise, and not
hinder it: which happened to the Saints, when they studied: who by that study did
not loose, but rather stirred up and increased their Devotion.

But in both businesses a measure and moderation is to be kept, ^east that
whith is less, hurt that which is greater: that is, least Martha hurt Mary,
who has ^hosen the better part. Therefore (...) certain holy man admonishes
^is brethren, that they should so ^abour that they extinguish not ^he spirit of
Devotion, to which all things should be serviceable. And the Wiseman says:
Get the Wisdom in the time of thy leisure; he shall be filled with Wisdom
that wholly attends on her: All the Heathen Philosophers do confirm this
sentence, who say that the soul becomes wise by ^easure and interior rest:
and not only by the interior rest of the Passions, but also by the exterior
quiet of labors and occupations.

For these two ought always to be joined together. For as a still and calm
water is fitter and more disposed to represent the images of shapes of things,
no otherwise then a glass: so also in a quiet and calm soul, all things are
represented most clearly and perfectly. For this cause the devil uses all
diligence, that he may comber and disturb the hearts of men with a thousand
kind of businesses, paynting and imagining in them diverse false necessities of
life, that they being busied and drowned in them, may have neither time nor
mind to call upon God.

We read that Pharaoh did the same thing tipically to the Exodus 5.
Children of Israel, who when they said that it was commanded unto them of
God, that they should go into the wilderness, that they might sacryfice unto
him: he answered that they were idle, and because they would ^ease from their
labors, therefore ^hey devised this new Devotion and sanctity: and he
commanded that they should be oppressed with labors, and that they should do
them, that they might not remember their Lord God. O how many has the prince
of this world drowned in the labors and works of vanity, whom he compels
to seek and search for stubble throughout all the Land, and night and day to
build Turrets and Towers in the mud and ^lay? who have not the least leisure or
opportunity, to attend upon God, that they might sacrifice unto him the
sacrifice of prayer: for they spend the whole time of their life in the
labors and works of Pharaoh.

What did exclude those three invited from that Evangelical feast, but too
much business, and superfluous cares? The first said* I have bought a farm, and

I have married (...) wife: and the providing for her, and for my family does
not permit me to come. And so they altogether were shut out from this most
sacred banquet.

Hence it is that men always occupied in earthly labors and businesses, and
secluded from the company and conversation of God, by little and little become
wholly carnal, and senceles in matters belonging to their own salvation.

That thou may acknowledge this to be true, hear with how great efficacy,
and vehemency ^f words Saint Bernarde does In his first book of
consideration.
^estifie that, writing unto Pope Eugenius: Hence, hence, says he, (...)
always stood in fear of thee, and still do fear: least the remedy being
deferred and thou ^ot able to sustain the grief, ^hou be irreuocably

I fear I say least in the midst ^f thy businesses (because they be many)

of ^eete and profitable sorrow. Thou ^halt do much more wisely, if ^or a time
thou withdrawest thy self from them: then suffer thy self to be drawn of
them: and ^y little and little to be lead of ^em whether thou would not.

Do thou ask whether? To a hard heart. Neither proceed to demand what
that is: if thou have not feared it, thou have it. It is only a hard heart,
which does not dread it self: because it feels not it self.

Why do thou demand of me what it is? Demand of Hardness of heart is

And that in few words (...) may comprehend all the evils ^f this horrible
mischief: it (...) that, which neither fears ^od, nor reuerenceth man.

Behold whether these cur^ed businesses are about to hale ^ee: if thou
proceedest as thou ^ast begun, so to give thy ^lfe over unto them, thou shall
^aue to thy self nothing of thy ^lfe.

Thou losest thy time: and if I may now be an other Iethro unto thee, thou
foolishly consumest thy self in those things, which are nothing else but
affliction of spirit, exulceration of mind, and euacuation of grace.

By which it is manifest, how great danger too much business does beget, and
in like manner, with what discretion and moderation, all businesses are to be
taken in hand, yea albeit they be holy: when as we see the businesses annexed
to so great a Bishoppricke, (which may seem requisite and necessary) are
called cursed of this holy man who terms them also foolish labors, and loss
of time, and yet not always, bu^ when they are undiscreetly tak^ in hand.

Therefore it is necessary, that a ^an exactly measure the strength ^his
spirit: that according to the ^ality of it he may take business upon him,
otherwise if the bur^n exceed his strength, what ^her thing is to be expected,
but ^e fall and ruin of the bearer?

That we may accomplish this ^e better and the easilier, two over famous
virtues are necessa^: Discretion and Fortitude. Dis^etion is the knowledge of
the ^easure, or of the power of our ^rength, and daily dispensation (...) our
time and exercise, by which ^e ought so to order our life, that (...) may be
orderly disposed in all ^ings. Which being know new (...) need of great
constancy and ^titude, to repel and reject all ^xternall businesses, which
offer ^emselues unto us: and that we ^ke no more burden upon us (our obedience
being alwai^ preserved) then we are able to undergo. For they that ouerload
themselves with businesses at the requests and importunities of other,
afterward they faint under their burden, so that they cannot satisfy either
one or other: and at length they understand and perceive, into what great
dangers they have cast themselves by their indiscreet arrogance.

To this victory, that supreme virtue is also co^ducent, which directs Before
all things we must obey the calling of God.
us to follow in all things, the good pleasure and calling of God: who always
calls us to mortification of our affections, and to those exercises, by which
it is attained: neither accepts he any external obedience, unless first we
satisfy his calling. Therefore the seruat of the Lord ought always to have
before his eyes that saying of Saul to David, when (...) promised his daughter
in ma^ge unto him, and David excu^g himself that he was un wor^y so royal a
marriage, calling ^mselfe poor and of small repu^tion: says he, The King has
no 1. Reg. 18.
^ede of a dowry, but of an hun^eth foreskinnes of the Philistines, (...) be
avenged of the Kings ene^ies. If then an earthlye King ^ath no need of the
riches of an ^other, how much less shall ^at heavenly King have need, ^ho
with one only beck can ^uerthrowe the whole world? ^ut he will have none
other thing, then that he may be a^enged of his enemies, which ^re sins and
sinful affections: ^ee would have the foreskinnes ^f these given unto him,
that ^he strength of them might be ^ircumcised and mortified.

And because this can hardely be brought to pass without the exercise of
prayer and meditation, God especially requires this obedience to be yielded
unto him before all other, which we are no^ bound unto. And surely it is no^
the least cause of the disorders and disturbances of the world, tha^ men serve
God not as he has commanded them, but as they themselves please.

There are certain things, which in the beginning may easily be repelled: but
when a man has given them entertainment, he cannot expel them, when he
would: and when he sees himself entangled and ensnared on every side, he
cannot unfold no^ deliver himself, albeit he greatly wish it: therefore it much
concerns him, that herein he use great wisdom, and that he foresee the
danger coming a far of, and ^at he arm himself before the ^anger light
upon him, and that Eccl. 18.

This needs not to be proved ^ith reasons: for in all places a ^an shall find
many examples of ^wise and inconsiderate men, ^ho in the beginning being care^s

embraced, which is ^duce^t, forcibl' and profitabl' unto all things, that is
unto piety and godliness. Thou ask what is piety? To attend upon

defined piety to be the worship of God. It is not so. If thou well considerest
it, I have expressed his sense in my words: albeit it b^ but in part. What is
more per^nent to the worship of God, then that he admonishes in ye psalm,
Attend and ma^ke, because I a^ God. Which surely in the parts o^ consideration
is an especial and principal thing. To be brief what is so available to al
things then by a certain favorable presumption to make the^ ours, which are
the parts of action it self: by forecasting after a certain manner, and
preordayning, what is to be done? Certainly this is necessary: least perchance
those things which are profitable unto us be^g foreseen and premeditated upon;

I (...) not doubt but has often hap^ned to thee, in thy weighty bu^esses, and
serious affairs. Ther^e no duty, nor obedience see^eth so far to bind a man,
but ^at it may be lawful for him, to ^ke unto him so much time, as ^necessary
to recollect and gather ^s spirit unto him, to attend vp^ God, and to order his
life a^ght: all these we attain by the ^eanes of contemplation: as the ^me
holy man shows at large, ^er those words, which a little ^fore we have
alleged, al which ^ast we be too long, we will leave ^re to relate.

Wherefore albeit this exercise ^nerally pertains to all men, yet more

^HE EIGHT IMPEDIment is the vice of Curiosity. CHAP. XXIIII.
THE vice of curiosity does also very much hurt deuoti^, which many ways may
be Curiosity is committed many ways.
^mmitted: For it is a certain ^de of curiosity, which desires ^prie into the
works, the life, ^d conversation of other men: ^ich besides that it burdeneth
^e heart with vain thoughts and ^gitations, it also enwrappeth ^n manifold
imaginations and desires, and takes away the peace and quietness of the
conscience. This vice is wont to be proper unto idle men, who when they have no
business of their own, they busy themselves with the sayings and doings of
others.

There is an other kind of curiositye proper unto the understanding, and
peculiarly belongs unto them, who of an only and sole desire to know, do
read profane Histories, and heathen books, and unprofitable Antiquities etc.
In like sort they also may be called curious after the same manner, who apply
their minds to read grave and learned Authors, and yet not with this intent,
that by them they may gain unto themselves tru^ wisdom: but by the same
curiosity only seek for Art, E^ loquence, and the pomp and glory of words,
or some elegant or curious sentence, which they may boast of, and vainly
recite before others; reserving by them no manner of profit unto themselves. Of
these says the Wiseman: The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel, he can
keep Eccl. 21.
no knowledge whiles he lives. Surely this is a most manifest sign and token
of a disordered wit, and of an inordinate soul. For as Saint Augustine says,
It is an argument of a good wit, and of a noble and generous spirit, not to
love words in words, but the truth, that is couched in them.

Furthermore there is a certain ^ther curiosity, which is an in^rdinate desire
of many, who ^ould have all that belongs unto ^e^, to be too exquisite,
elaborate, ^o count and piked, as well in their houses, as in their apparel,
householde stuff, books, pictures, and such like ornaments, which cannot be
desired nor preserved without great diligence. And when they are done
otherways, then we would, it cannot be, but that they displease us, and vex
our minds, and bring us to that point, that we straight think either of their
making away, or of new repayring and embellishing the^. Whereby the peace and

mind altogether quiet, and fr^ from all impediments.

The Devil knowing this in pediment to be so great, do^ bend all his
strength, (as a c^taine Doctor says) to ensnare all men of whatsoever age and
estate in this vice: the layety by soliciting and provoking them to settle
their chiefest care upon the finding out and bringing in of new and outlandish
kinds of apparel, householde stuff, and such like things: The clergy and
learned, that they endeavor themselves, to have their temples, churches,
colleges, houses, and other ornaments curious and precious; and this he does
under a show of godliness, whilst he persuades them, that the servants of
God do deserve all things, and that they are worthy of all honor: and
therefore that it is not vici^ous nor uncomely to build sump^uous houses, to
erect proud and ^tately palaces, that they may ^dwell in them with mirth and
^oye. Such men have either not read, or have ill observed the whole some
doctrines of holy, and spiritual men: for the true servants of God do little
esteem these things, yea they do despise them, and fly from them, as from
things, which neither can be gotten, nor preserved, without distraction of
heart, and loss of time: which two are most contrary unto the exercise of
Devotion. For as Devotion is a very delicate thing: so it is obscured and lost
by a light and little matter. For if the morning Sun beams did hinder the
contemplation of Saint Anthony: how much more shall the unquiet cogitations of
seeking and keeping earthlye goods hurt, which have well feathered wings
swiftely to fly out of our sight?

For this cause Evangelical poverty is much to be commended. which at one blow
cutteth off all this vain curiosity, after his example, who when he was Lord
of all creatures, had none other bed when he was borne, but a hard cratch,
nor none other house, but the common stable.

THE NINTH IMPEdiment is, if good exercises be interrupted and broken off.
CHAP. XXV.
IN like manner it is a great, and a very usual impediment unto Devotion,
oftentimes to interrupt and break off the thread of good exercises without a
lawefull cause. For we must know, that among all the miseries Our heart is
easily inclined unto evil, but hardly unto good.
of man's heart, one of the chiefest is, that as it is prompt and inclined to
all evil, so it is remiss and slow unto any good. For in evil no other
thing is required to inflame our heart, yea and our body too, but a light and
small thought, which by and by vanishes away: but for a good affection, as
Devotion is, we must search heaven and earth, and desire aid of all things,
which are given unto us of God. Of man it is said, That he is a wind that
passes and comes not again: For with Psalm. 78.
great facility he goes after vanities, and corruptible things; but he
returns not again from them, without great difficulty. Certainly, if men
would ponder with reason all their miseries, they should feel none greater,
nor admire any more. Therefore we must labor with all our strength, that
Devotion may be preserved: for as it is a very easy matter to loose it, so it
is a most difficult thing to recover it being lost.

Wherefore not without cause we say, that it is a great impediment in this
business, if the thread of good exercises be broke of. For when as man would
afterward return unto himself, he finds himself so unapt, and so unfit
for Devotion, as if he had never had it, or that he had only saluted it at the
door, and very entrance. For that happens unto him, which we read in ^imes
past happened to Saint Pe^er, when he said: Master, we ^aue traveled all
night, and have Luke 5.
taken nothing. The same thing ^appeneth unto them, who are negligent in this
exercise, as Saint Barnarde says very well in these words: How long In his
first book of Consideration to Eugenius.
will thou lift up thine heart in prayer, and lift it up in vain? How
long will thou move thy self, but not any whit the forwarder? How long will thou endeavor thy self, but to noe purpose? Do thou labor, and not bring
forth? Do thou make trial, and never a whit the better? And wheresoever
thou beginnest, do thou there leave off? And in thine ass^ye, do thou
faint? All this difficulty hence arises, because the exercise of Devotion is
intermitted* therefore thy heart is vvaxen cold, and therefore by the just
judgment of God this punishment is inflicted upon thee: that thou being
admonished by this punishment for thine abuse of grace received, thou may
more warilye preserve it being recovered again. Solomon excellentlye teaches
this by a notable similitude: If the iron (says he) be blunte, and one has
not whet the Eccl. 10.
edge, he must then put to more strength, and after labor wisdom will
follow. Which words, albeit they have sundry meanings, and may be applied to
diverse things: yet most fitly they are understood of the study of Devotion and
of the holy Scriptures: of which Saint Hierome also does expound them. For
experience it self teaches, that (...) a man has at any time lost the use of
Devotion and the fervor of the spirit, what great trou^le he has, before he
can again recover them: which when ^ee has eftesoones received, let him be
thoroughly and for ever admonished, that most diligently he preserve so great
benefits and blessings, least unluckily he again relapse into the like
misfortune.

Furthermore, as the interrupting of this exercise does very much hinder
Devotion: so on the other side, the continual use of it Continual use of
Devotion does increase it* Similies.
is very conducent to the attayning of it. The tree that is watered in due
season, does increase, and brings forth fruit: The child that has milk, and
breasts ready to give it suck, when it desires, grows and waxes bigger. A
student in the liberal sciences, if he often repeat his lecture, and
diligently frequent the school of his Master, in a short time comes to the
perfection of the Arts* he studieth: so on the contra^y part, he that often
and much intermitteth and breaks off his study, either very late, or never
becomes learned. For when after a certain time he returns again to his
study, he has forgotten those things, which before he had learned: and so
still in beginning he consumes his age, and spends his time.

It is true, that when the delay and intermission is short, or for some godly
and lawful cause, that God does sooner restore that was lost. Hence it is that
a faithful and an obedient servant sometimes feels his prayer doubled, after
that he has performed his obedience. But this is without controversy, that
the perfect in this intermission walk with lesser Intermissio^ of Devotion does
less hurt the perfect then the imperfect.
danger, then those that are young beginners: for these are those that are of
the poorer sort, and are more hungry, if they labor not every day, they have
not to eat: But those that are richer and more perfect, always have substance
in themselves, by which they can for a time continue their estate, albeit they
gain no further matter. Therefore I think that this is one of the chief
differences between the perfect and imperfect, to wit, that the perfect are as
trees planted in a moist and fruiteful ground, which although they be not
watered, by the space of certain days, yet they preserve their greenenes, and
bring forth fruit: but the imperfect are like trees standing in a dry and
sandy earth, upon which if water be not daily powered, all the beauty and
strength, which they had, perishes: whereby it manifestly appears, that they
wanted sap and moisture within the^. Of this sort at this day is the greater
part of those y^ be Devout; but the former sort are very few and scarce.
Therefore let him that is desirous of Deuotition continue and persevere in
religious and godly exercises, and let him compose his life after the manner of
a well ordered clock, doing all things in due time, and laboring as much as
lies in him, that the thread and continuance of devotion be not broke off.

THE TENTH IMPEdiment consists in delicates, and in too much meat and
drink. CHAP. XXVI.
FVrthermore another impediment in this way is very noto^ious, which
co^sistethin too much delicacy, and in superfluous meat and drink. Therefore in
the Scriptures Fasting and Prayer, as two brethren, are always joined
together; and for the same cause the holy Fathers, who hid themselves in the
wilderness, that they might give themselves to conte^plation were so austere in
their fastes and abstinence.

For we see, that as corporal fasting does lift up the spirit to God: so on
the other side superfluity of meat and drink does cast it down, and hinders
the course. The reason is, because to lift up the spirit to contemplate that
eternal light, and to order and dispose it for the receipt of ye influences and
splendors of that light, is a thing so hard, and so supernatural, that as
Augustine says, it is necessary that a man bring al his force and strength
together, that he may use it in this ascending, if he will thither come,
whither he ende^oureth.

For such an high and sublime ^scention requires a light and ^imble slender
man, and free from ^ll heaviness, that may pull him ^ownwards. Superfluity of
meat Too much meat and drink does many ways hinder the ascending of the soul.
and drink is contrary to his slen^ernes and nimblenes, which not ^y one way,
but by diverse does ^inder this ascending.

First, because a great part of the 1
^owers of the soul are occupied (...) the work of digestion, where^ nature
her self performs as (...) were her task, and commaun^th all the powers and
faculties (...) do their office and duty. ^ence it is, that men, after they
^ue well eat and drunk, are ^auier and more sleepy, and more ^fit and unapt
for any study of ^nsideration, or devotion.

Secondly, because fumes and 2
vapors as out of a seething pot ascend to the brain, wherein is the seat of
that faculty, which has the cheifest part in the actions of contemplation, and
obscureth all that part, as it were with a dark cloud, and hinders the
operation of that faculty: and consequently the operation of the understanding.
Hence that sentence of the Greeks sprung which Saint Hierome cites in (...)
Hierome in an Epist. to Nepotianus.
certain Epistle; A full belly begets not a nimble spirit. The contrary is
written of Julius C^sar, that he came sober and fas^ing to the Roman Empire:
b^ which kind of speaking is sign^fied, that with great aduisednes (...)
wisdom he set his hand to the business. For this is proper and p^culiar unto
men that are sober (...) fasting.

Thirdly, because we natural ^e that the taking of too much ^eate and drink
does solicit ^e heart of man unto vain things: ^at is to prattle, fable,
geere, ^ort, play, and such like. For as ^e spirit, when it is full of
De^otion, does inuit the heart to ^irituall and divine things: so ^e body
being full of meat does ^aw and hale the same unto cor^rall and vain matter.
Hitherto ^aketh that of Gregory: Of the Effects of gourmandising.
^turity and fulness of the body a^eth vain joy, trifling, babbling, ^nality, a
gross and dull vn^rstanding, and such like. By ^ich words it appears, how
^tfull this vice is unto him, who ^steneth to this end, which (...) propose in
this book, and ^traryewise how profitable (...) opposite virtue is: to wit,
^ting and temperance.

Chrysostom does also accord with him; Fasting, says he, does bring forth
light and nimble feathers, that the soul may be carried a loft, and
co^template the highest things, and that it may be superior to all pleasures,
and to all things, which are counte^ sweet in this world. As ships o^ A Simily.

do bring much hurt and damage unto this exercise: first, because they do
spend and consume that time, which is consecrated to holy watching, and at what
^ime the soul was to be fed, the ^ody is stuffed and glutted: and ^fterwardes
when the stomach ^s over burdened with meat and drink, man can neither rise
at midnight to praise the Lord, nor ^ray in the morning; both which ^imes are
most profitable for this ^xercise.

gluttonously filled ^ith superfluity of meats. Not ^nely to eat too much, but
also to feed too deliciously and delicately hinders devotion: certainly
magnificent bankets, and sumptuou^ feasts, and such like dainty superfluities
are exceeding enemies and plagues unto this exercise. For in what thing is
there greate^ loss of time? where becomes the spirit more inordinate? where
becomes the wholem an more dissolute, then among such feast and pleasures:
there a man being inflamed with the heat of win^ and the taste of the daintyes,
and wi^ the mirth of the feasters, sha^et^ not blusheth nor to blab whats^ ever
comes within his head^ What time is here sost* into wh^ great dangers do men
cast the^ selves? how many uncomely a^ unseemly things do they, who^
profession it is not once to na^ the^ how many s^fts and sleigh^ do they find
out, ye they may continually persevere in these misde^enors? how often happens
it unto ^he^ that for these they lose peace, ^harity and concord? That great
Wiseman very well understood ^his, when so often in the Proverbs ^e remembers
the^, as he, in very ^ced had learned, how great evils ^id follow feasts and
bankets. For ^e says; He that loves bankets, Prou. 22.
^all be in need; and he that loves ^ine and feasts shall not be rich. and
in another place; Keep not Prou. 23.
^mpanie with drunkords, nor ^ith gluttons. For the drunkard ^d the glutton
shall be poor, and ^e sle^per shall be clothed in ^gges.

And again in another place ^th great earnestness he re^embreth, what evils
and mis^iefes follow this vice; To In the same place.
^ome, says he, is woe? to whom ^orrowe? to whom is st^ife? To whom is
murmuring? to whom are wounds without cause? and to whom is the redines of the
eyes? Even to them that tarry long at the wine, to them that go, and seek
mixed wine. All these and many more mischeeses does this vic^ bring with it.

Wherefore the Wiseman a^ the length concluding this matter says; Wine is a
mocker, an^ strong drink is raging: and whoso^ ever is deceived thereby, is
not wis^ The reason is in readiness; for it i^ most certain, that the way t^
true Wisdom is by tears, an^ mortification of the affections which in all
things are hindr^ and contraried by the delight (...) the body, and by the
desires a^ appetites of pleasures. For (...) (Chrysostom being witness) fi^ A

cannot be kindled nor kept (...) wet and moist matter: so neyth^ can
compunction in the delights and pleasures of the body: for these two are so
contrary between themselves, that one kills another: for the one is the
mother of mourning, the other of laughter; the one does bind the heart the
other does lose it.

Therefore let this be a general rule; Let the servant of God be A general
rule.
always mindful of that most bitter gall and vinegar, which the Son of
God tasted of for the love of us, let him be content with common meats, and let
him take them with that moderation, that ^e may be always fit and apt to ^ift
up his spirit to heaven, and to ^ate any spiritual meat: so that ^o burden of
body or meat press ^r draw him downwardes. Let ^im remember that ye perfection
of (...) Christian life is continual prai^r, and society with God.

Therefore whose duty it is to have his spirit lifted up unto God, his it is
also to have his spirit and body disposed and prepared unto it.

If a harper intend to play upon his harp all the day, ought he not to have
his stringes all the time well tuned and fitly agreeing? And if a hunter or a
Faulkner be disposed to hunt and hauk^ all the day, ought he not all the time
to have his hawks and hounds at his hand? Go to then, seeing that the life
of a perfect Christian is none other thing then, a continual hunting of God and
his grace, and a continua^ harmonye of the inward spirit which is made by
prayer, it is me and requisite, that he that will a^ tend upon this exercise,
that h^ spirit and body be disposed an^ apt unto it.

This is that Saint Hierome persuades In his Epist to Laeta.
unto a certain Virgin, saying; Let the fare of a Virgin be a few herbs, and
sometimes a few small fishes. Let her so eat, that she may always be hungry,
that forthwith after meat she may be able to read, and pray. The same man
also admonishes that it is better always to keep In his Epist. to Furia.
this rule in eating and drinking, then sometimes too wide to open the sails
of fasting, so that the body is enfeebled thereby; and by and by after to lose
the raines unto the gullet, that man thereby is in danger of bursting. The
same man also in another place, and in other words, says: A spare diet, and a
belly always hungry is preferred before a fast of three days, and it is
better every day to take a little, then once to take enough.

That is the best rain, which leysurely descends upon the earth. A sudden
and dashing shower headlong beats down the corn and grass. Therefore when
thou eatest think that presently after thou art to read and pray. Hitherto
Hierome.

They that live with such moderation and temperance, shall have great
treasuries and storehouses of time, and in few days shall live a long life:
for all the time of their life is profitable, and not any part of it vainly
passes away. Therefore albeit a righteous man dye quickly, yet he has a long
life: for he profitteth every hour, and makes gain of every moment of his
life. But the wicked and ungodly, whose belly is their God, they always carry
about a soul dead in life, and buried in the dunghill of too much meat and
drink: and so in a manner they spend all their life time, in vnbuckling their
girdles, and in providing and dressing superfluous meats, and in drawing
forth their hours in sleep. These therefore live like Epicures, and as people
borne to none other end, then to eat and drink, and to engrosse and fat their
bellies, intending none other exercise, neither having regard of any other
time, or business. How then can any one say, that these do live a long life, or
the life of a man, when as scarcely they bestow one hour upon any thing, which
is worthy the spirit and nobility of man.

THE ELEVENTH IMpediment is the evil disposition and weakness of the body.
CHAP. XXVII.
AN impediment contrary to the former is (as says Saint Bernarde) too much
abstinence, and weakness of body, or whatsoever other evil disposition or
debility, whether it be hunger or thirst, or cold, or heat, or whatsoever
other accident. For there is so great society and sympathy between the soul
and the body, that when as this is ill disposed, or stands need of any thing,
the other cannot lift it self up freely enough to contemplate and meditate on
heavenly things with quietness and tranquilitye: for the love of her friend
does call her away and does disquiet he^, and calls her thither, where it is
grieved: neither grants her leave to attend any other business, unless God of
his especial grace does dispense with it: as many times he is wont to do.

Therefore it is meet that a Devout man keep that moderation and temperaunce
in chasticing and exercising his body, that it neither grow gross nor unfit
by superfluous delicates; neither that be weakness by too much rigor and
austerity, that it faint under the burden.

For as we are to observe in a ^harpe, that the stringes be neither stretched
too straight, nor loosened too slack (for then they are either broken, or
yield an untuned and an unpleasant sound) so in this celestial Music, it is
meet that the body be neither macerated by too much hunger, nor fatted by two
much plenty: for both of them bring very much hurt to this exercise. For this
cause God commanded in the old law that salt (by which we understand
discretion) should be spinkled upon all the sacrifices, that he might insinuat,
that none of our sacrifices (although they be great) are acceptable unto him
unless they be seasoned with salt, that is, with the savor of discreation.

But because it is a hard thing to keep a mean, and the flesh does always
seek it self, therefore it is necessary, that in these cases a man's own
opinion be always suspected unto himself: and if we must needs lean to one
of ye extremities, it is always more safe, that we chose that, which is most
repugnant to the flesh, then that which fawneth and smileth on ^t: for albeit
we do bridle and re^aine it, yet it will take an occa^ion sometimes to
satisfy the de^ires: neither is it enough, that now and then it be defrawded
of neces^ities; but we must always watch: ^or unless thou do diligently
watch, it will one time or other ^reake out, and steal many lusts and
desires, and those very super^uous.

^FCERT AIN OTHER particular impediments. CHAP. XXVIII.
THe precedent impediments are general, which com^only are wont to meet with
all ^rts of people in the way of de^tion.

There are also other particular hindrances, according to the natural
dispositions and affections of every one. As we see that certain are so
unnaturally studious and diligent in that, which they have determined to do,
that if they have the least thing in the world in hand, they cannot rest till
it be done: nay they cannot sleep in the night, before they have finished,
that they purposed: and therefore they never have any leisure to persevere in
Prayer.

Others as it were lunaticke, to^ whom oftentimes happens suc^ an earnest
longing and fervor o^ mind, that they cannot contain^ themselves, unless
presently they have their desires satisfied, albe^ they utterly forsake and
renounc^ God.

This is proper unto those me^ who are violently drawn and ^aled of their
appetites and affec^ions, and who are always accu^omed to have their wills and
de^res fulfilled; who like women ^reat with child are so tickled ^ith
immoderate appetites and af^ctions, and are so subject unto this ^ce, by reason
of the evil habit, which by long use they have put ^n, that if forthwith they
have ^ot their desires satisfied, they ey^er seem to dye, or else fall into a
^sease.

These the devil draws ^sily away from the exercise of ^ayer, drawing them
after their ^petites, as if they were bound ^th a chain. There are many ^d the
world is every where (...) full of them, that when ^ers go to prayer, they
go to ^eyr worldly business, who drive their weekly labors to be done upon the
Saboath day, when they should be at Church to pray and to hear Divine service
and Sermons.

Let these men know, that they are the devils slaves, and that the Devil
leads them bound in chains, whither he lists, even to their perdition and
destruction. Therefore let them beware, and seriously regard what is the cause
of this their deuiation and seduction, for without all doubt (and so let them
persuade themselves) it is the work of the devil.

But above all particular impedymentes, the inordinate lou^ of any thing does
more especially hurt, which is embraced with the whole mind, and with all the
affection.

We must here know that ther^ Every man has some idol.
is scarce one in the world sor^ ligious, or so free from passions, that has
not some idol, that he serves, and adoreth: that is, some thing, upon which
he bestows his whole affections, and for the love of which, he does all that
he can. The mind of some is wholly swallowed up in the study of science and
eloquence: and upon these two studies they bestow all their endeavor and
pains: so that they seek no other thing in the world, they respect no other
thing, but only this: supposing that there is nothing greater then this
study, nor any thing more worthy the spirit and nobility of man.

The desire of worldly honor, the favor of Princes and great personages, and
the possessions of temporal goods do draw others away. Thou shall see many,
who are altogether busied in heaping together great treasuries, that they may
enrich their heirs, and be said to be the authors and founders of some noble
house and family. There be also not a few, whose minds are less generous,
that then suppose themselves happy, when they have scraped together a certain
sum of money, whereby they may purchase for themselves some inheritance, or
some office. There be others, that think of nothing more, then of some famous
and notable marriage, either for themselves or for some of theirs, whether he be
son, daughter, or cousin german: for this being obtained, they suppose that
there is nothing, which may further be desired. To be brief, others are carried
away and bound with other affections and desires, no otherwise then beasts are
bound at a cratch, every one with their several halters. And when they have
once opened a way for these affections unto their heart, with the same study
and love ye men embrace the last end, they seek and follow after means, by
which they may obtain, that they desire. Therefore some, night and day apply
their books, that they may come to their wished end: Others, as long as they
live, do wholly endeavor themselves to heap and hoard up wealth. Others give the^
selves to traffike and merchandise, or do some other thing, that they may gain
unto themselves, that they seek for. For after that they ^aue given place to
the root, they are also compelled, will they nill ^hey, to give place to all the branches that sprout and spring from it. These without doubt are hurtful
plants, these are those thorns in the gospel, which choke the seed of the word
of god. For the man ye is enwrapped in these businesses with so superfluous a
care, has neither time, nor mind at liberty to attend upon the service of God.

Therefore it happens many times, that the devil does presently disturb a
man in Prayer, withdraw him from his exercise, and casts him headlong from
heaven upon the earth: and oftentimes haleth and pulls him, that he may turn
himself to effect^ that, to which the affection and passion of his mind does
allur^ and inuit him: so that when god calls him to his table, to his
embrace, to the fruition of his joys, and participation of his spirit, he will
not come, he contemns the voice of the Lord and with greedines does follow^
those vanities, to which his appetites do call him.

Therefore let him be assured, that seeks for God thus, that he shall never
find him. For no man Math. 6.
^s our Savior says, can serve two Masters, for either he shall hate ^e one,
and love the other, or else he ^all lean to the one, and despise the ^her. They
that do the contrary ^e like unto the new inhabitants (...) Samaria, which the
King of ^sshur sent thither, of whom the ^cripture says, That they (...) 4.
Reg. 17.
the Lord: and also served other ^ods. To these that of the Pro^et Samuel to
the children of ^aell may be said: If ye be come 1. Reg. 7.
^aine unto the Lord, with all your ^art, put away the strange Gods ^m among
you, and direct your ^rts unto the Lord, and serve him ^ly, and he shall
deliver you out of (...) hand of the Philistines. If men ^uld diligently
consider, how ^ch that is, which they owe unto God, and how little it is, that
man's heart can give: they should manifestlye see, that this worship and
service cannot be de*uided, seeing that so much is due^ and so little is given.
The bedd^ is straight, says Esaye, that (...) Esaias 28.
cannot suffice, and the eouerin^ narrow that it cannot cover two.

This is perspicuously and euiden^ly seen in the streightnes of man heart,
which cannot together c^taine God and the world.

Who does deny but that he ill linked in marriage, who cast his eyes upon an
other wom^ beside his own wife?-so also he ill linked unto the divine w^dome,
whose mind is ent^ gled in foreign love.

Go to then my brother, (...) that thou be a chaste lover of t^ heavenly
spouse: beware t^ thou be not an unfaithful bri^ groom, or an adulterer unto
^at holy and devout Wisdom: ^ware that thou bring not in^thine house an
harlot. For ^peake in truth and verity, that ^ere is not any whore so young ^d
beautiful, which does so ^caye and quench wedlock ^e, and that does so
steal ^ay and consume that a man ^th, as any one of these affe^ons, when they
are too in^dinate: for they do quench and ^t out the love of God, and do
^sume all the good, that we ^ght reap by it.

Therefore it is meet that he that ^l walk in this way, that he ^te out of his
mind all foreign extrauagant affections, and that A heart free from appetites
and concupiscences is to be offered unto God.
offer his heart unto God, as the ^t matter, or as clean paper, ^e from al
stain and pollution, ^t God himself may imprint in it, whatsoever he will
without any contradiction. This is that resignation, which is so much com
mended of those that write of spiritual life, to which resignati^ on it
pertains to offer to God heart pure and free from all earthly affections and
worldly desires: tha^ there may not be any thing in i^ which may stay the
influences, and hinder the operations of the ho^ Ghost.

Here we are to note, that tw^ things are required in the perf^ ction of every
work, one that the agent, the other that is the patient: one that commandet^
the other that obeys. If the desire that God should perfe^ his work in
thee, have an e^ how these two are to be dispos^ of. Because it is unmeet and
v^ seemly that God should obey^ and that thou should gouern^ Give to Caesar
those things that ^e Caesar: and to God those things ^at are Gods: that is,
suffer God (...) rule thee, to direct thee, and to ^ork in thee what pleases
him: ^d let thy hand be directed by ^shande, as a pen is in the and of a
writer, which resists ^t. But there is none other resi^nce or repugnancy
besides that, which is wrought by the affecti^s and by the will, and by their
^erations and actions.

But because in this life we can^tbee altogether free from all ^tward
businesses and external ^ercises, at ye least let us do that, ^t our minds
be not ouer^elmed and ouerborn of them, (...) let the affection of Divine
^sedome have always the ^pter in her hand, and always ^re sway in our
endeavors and ^dies.

Let us with all our heart alwaie^ say that of the Wiseman; I ha^ Sap. 8.
loved her, and sought her from (...) youth: I desired to marrye he^ such love
had I unto her beauty This is ourlast end, this is t^ certaintye of our
felicity, for the we were created, and for this (...) things were created.

Let us think that we l^ all the time, that we spen^ in it, and whatsoever
time d^ pass away without it (so the a lawefull cause does not h^ der) let
us suppose that it is l^ of us.

Let us handle all our ot^ business rather in body, the in spirit, rather
with our han^ then with our hearts, acc^ ding to the counsel of the postle,
saying: This then I (...) Brethren, because the time is she 1. Cor. 7.
hereafter that both they which (...) wives, be as though they had ^one: And
they that weep, as though they wept not: and they ^bat rejoice, as though they
reioy^ed not: and they that buy, as though they possessed not: And ^ey that
use this world, as though ^hey used it not: for the fashion of ^his world
goes away. Seeing ^erefore that all these things ^e so short and brickle,
they ^eserue not to be embraced with ^at love and affection, which ^at chiefest
good deserves to ^e loved.

This is of so great moment, ^at of it alone depends the ^der of a spiritual
life, as ma^festly is shown by this Argu^ent: In moral actions the end ^he
root and the foundation that, which is to be done: ^refore if the ends be
orde^ after a due and right manner and by direct means, all things tending to
them shall be rightly ordered: but if the ends be disordered, changed and
perverted all things thither tending shall be disordred and prevented.

Therefore imagine, and firmly propound unto thy self, that the chief
foundation and ground o^ thy life is to be conversant an^ familiar with God;
think tha^ this is thy joy, that this is thin^ inheritance, that this is thy
trea^ sure, and that this is thy cheefe^ good: shut thine eyes at all oth^
things, and trample them vnd^ thy feet, that thou may end^ uour this one
thing to wit, who^ to deuote thy self unto God. F^ this study (as we have
said) is the end, for which we were create^ This is the best work, that can^
done of any creature: this is (...) best part that Mary has chose^ this is
most acceptable unto God: this is most agreeable unto his worship: this is the
work and labor of a conte^platiue life, which is more excellent and more
perfect then the active: to be brief here our heart is exercised in the
actual love of God, which is the best of all our labors. For as Thomas
Aquinus says, the innermost affection of charity is the most excellent, and
of all those affections that proceed from man, ^t is the most acceptable unto
God.

Therefore to what study more excellent, or to what business more noble can
thou apply thy ^inde? If thou be a friend unto ^cience, and desire to be
taught ^ue Wisdom, be secure and without dread, God does here each his
friends and familiars ^ch deep mysteries and secrets, as do exceed all
Philosophy. Besides the wisdom, that God de^ liuereth here, is so high, and
excellent, that it excels all gole^ that is, man's wisdom being compared
with it, is as a corne^ sand, and all silver entering comparison with it, is as
clay.

Furthermore as no end is to b^ preferred before this, so neyth^ are other
businesses and occup^ tions to be preferred before the exercises and means, by
whi^ this end is obtained. Whatso^ uer is in the world, is accident^ and
unstable: only the love God mounteth above all things rules and prevails in
all thin^ and governs all things. The is not any sin more grieuo^ then to
place Dagon by the A^ of the covenant, as the P^ stines did: but the Arc of
covenant is to be seated in a m^ high and eminent place, and ^agon is to be
cast upon the ^arth groueling before the Arc ^f the Lord.

The love of the end being thus ^rdered and disposed, all ourlife ^all be well
ordered, but if the ^ue of the end be disordered, all ^r life will be confused
and di^rbed.

^F CERTAIN COM^on temptations, which are wont very much to molest and trouble
those that are devout and given to Prayer. CHAP. XXIX.
^IME and place now requires, that we speak of the more common and usual
temptations, which are wont very much to annoy and disquiet devout men, and
also that we entreat of the remedies against them.

OF THE FIRST AND most usual temptations, which is the want of spiritual
consolations.
THe first temptation, which is incident to very many, i^ too much grief,
which does afflict them, when they feel not (...) sensible Devotion, and when
sp^ rituall comforts do fail the^ For many when they find neyth^ these
consolations, nor can she^ tears, are so troubled and mol^ sted in their
exercises, that the fall into temptation of faint-har^ ednes and distrust:
supposing the God is angry with them, and that he does love them no more, to
whom he denies his wonted ^oyes, and accustomed consolations.

There be others who when divine consolations do fail them forthwith, have
recourse unto humane comforts, and begin to cry at the gate of the flesh, when
they perceive that the other door ^s shut against them: so that ^hese do no
longer continue nor persevere in the way of the Lord, ^hen the divine
consolations and ^eauenly influences are powered ^owne upon them: but as soon
^s these are taken away, presently ^ey withdraw themselves from ^eir
interprised endeavors, and ^ll into a forgetfulness of them^lues. No fruit nor
commodi^ is to be looked for of these, so ^ng as they loyter and waver after
this manner. For they are A Simily.
as that unprofitable seed in the Gospel, that fell upon stonye ground,
where it had not much earth, and anon it sprung up, because it had no depth of
earth, and when the Sun rose up, it was parched, and for lack of rooting,
withered away. Such never have any stability nor steedfastnesse in their manner
of living: for even A Simily.
as the Sea swells when the Moon increases, and ebbeth, when it decreaseth:
so these are governed by the flux and refluxe of spiritual consolations: now
they have their senses and spirits gathered together, presently after dispersed
and disseuered: sometimes they are devout, sometimes undevout and dissolute:
now quiet, now unquiet: for when they have none other ground no^ constancye
besides divine consolations, they cannot be stable nor constant in their manner
of living.

In like manner there be many, who when they do not find in their prayers
those tears, and that compunction, they wish, they endeavor to wrest it
forth by violence, and to express it as it were by the force and strength of
their arms: who by how much more they labor in this kind, by so much they
become harder, and more desolate and destitute of their purpose.

Which the Lord has so disposed, that they may understand that this water and
moisture is not of blood, but of heaven: and that it is not compassed by man's
strength, but is waited for by humility and patience, when and how the Lord
will give it: for he it is, as it is written in Job, Who binds the waters in
his clouds, and the cloud is not broken under them, who holds back the face
of his throne, and spradeth his cloud upon it. Who covers the light Job. 36.
with the clouds, and commands it to come again.

But that it may more manifestly be declared, which has been spoken, I will in
this place set down the causes, for which god many times does withdraw and
deny unto his, spiritual consolations, and what at this time is to be done.

REASONS OR CAUSES, for which God now and then denies to his friends
spiritual consolations. CHAP. XXX.
FIrst and foremost in this place we are to know, that God does not always
take comfortes and consolations from his servants, because their sins and
offenses have deserved it: but oftentimes for other causes: Among which this is
first and chiefest, 1
that the health and life of the righteous may be preserved. For now and then
it comes to pass, that such is the greatness of joy and comfort, which is
felt in prayer, and which God bestows of his bounty, wisdom and goodness
upon his, that if it should long continue, neither the feeble body could bear
it, neither could they remember, what the necessity of their body required:
but they would neglect to relieve themselves.

Therefore our gracious Lord does sometimes take from them those consolations
and that celestial sweetness, that they may recure the weakness of their
body, and so their life might be preserved without miracle, which being
continued, they at the last might enjoy a greater and a more royal crown.

Sometimes he does this 2
that humility may be preserved, that we may know that this goo^ when we have
it, is not ours, bu^ his: and therefore that we cannot have it when we would
but when it pleases GOD, t^ give it unto us.

For this cause, says a certain holy man, it is often denied, when it is
sought for; and it is granted, when it is not expected: that thereby it may
appear that it is the work of the divine grace.

In like manner God does away 3
his consolations, that he may prove and try us: that is, that he may see
whether we will ^e faithful friends unto him at all times: as well in
aduersitye, ^s in prosperity: or whether we serve him for our own commoditye,
or rather for his glory and love. For a true friend, Prou. 17.
(...) Solomon says, loves at all ^mes: and a brother is borne for ^duersity.

Sometimes God does this, that 4
^y this means he may take a^ay the occasion, that man may not always be
occupied in the exercise of a contemplative life: but that he also may descend
to the active, in which also it behooves us to be exercised, that we may be
skillful and expert in all kind of virtue, that we may say with the Prophet:
My heart is prepared O God, my heart is prepared. He says twice prepared, that
he might signify that his heart was prepared for the consolations of a
contemplative life, and also for the troubles of an active, for the sweetness
of the divine love, and for labors for the love of his neighbor, for the
Cross, and for the kingdom, to supp with the Lord at his table, and to
descend with him to the battle.

This is that the wiseman admonishes us of, when he says: Let not thine hand
be stretched out to receive, and close fisted to give. For we must not only
be prepared to receive divine graces but also to be sacrificed for him, if
need require.

Happy is that soul, whose heart is so disposed, and who remaining in that
perfect subjection enjoys perfect liberty, as a perfect ^handmayde of God,
being in deed a Lady over all things: for she subiecteth all things under
her, neither can any thing disturb her peace. All men cannot aspire ^o this
degree of perfection: for Saint Gregory says, that there ^re but a few, which
come to that ^xterity, which Aoth had, of Iud. 3.
whom the Scripture says: that ^ee used both hands as his right ^and: who is
a figure of perfect ^en, who are no less dexterous ^d expert in the works and
la^ours of the active life, then in the sweetness and delicacies of the
contemplative, which certainly is granted but to very few.

It also happens that there are certain religious persons 5
found, which always in a manner live in the continual dryness of heart, and
that not through their own sault, but because it so pleases the Lord, who will
not always bring his elect by the same way, nor save them after one manner:
but after many and sundry ways: that so his Wisdom, and providence might
more appear through those sundry means, which he uses in promoting and
procuring the salvation of his elect.

Therefore he does not work always after the same manner, as they that do
all things after one example and type: but after many and sundry ways, as he
that is free, and can do whatsoever it pleases his divine Majesty.

So that as he himself is an infinite virtue: so has he diverse ways to
work our salvation. I know, says a certain Doctor, that this Doctrine will
be very welcome unto certain luke warm and idle persons: for they are wont to
take this to veyle and cloak their negligence, saying: that they feel and
taste no Devotion not through their own negligence, but by the divine
dispensation, when notwithstand^ng the cause of this their want ^s, that they
are negligent and slothful in their Prayers, and that they wythdrawe
themselves from all good exercyses: neither will ^hey knock at his gate, who
never dispyseth their. prayers, that pray fervently: but gives them that they
desire, or at least that which is convenient and wholesome for them.

Besides the reasons remembered, there is another, and that God denies comfort
unto his, that they be more perfect.
not the least, to wit, because God would lift up his elect to the highest
degree of perfection. For we must not be ignorant, that spiritual
consolations are the food o^ infants, and the sweet milk, with which God
nourishes his, and calls them from the pleasureso^ the world, that they
being ina^ moured with the sweetness o^ these delights, may despise al other
allurements, and being wholly pos^ sessed with the plesantnes of the divine
love, may cast a way all the love of this world. For otherwis^ men (so great is
their weakenes^ could never be brought to r^ nounce one love, except the found
another more sweet, more pleasant, and more excellent: by which they being
allured, might of their own accord forsake their former.

For this cause we see that many times the comfortes of young ^eginners are
greater and more ^ensible, then theyrs, who have ^eene longer exercised: for
God ^eth that they are most necessa^ for young beginners, and there^re
according to the equality of their disease, he provides a re^edy for them.

But after that they be some^hat grown, and have increased ^rough the
nourishment of this ^od, God wills, that they leave ^ to be children, that
they ab^aine from milk, and that they ^e fed with more solid meat. ^hen I
was a child, says the A^stle, 1. Cor. 13.
I spoke as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became (...) man, I put
away childish things. S^ we see among birds, and brut^ beasts, how when
they hau^ brought forth their young, bot^ the dammes together do bring food
to the nest, and do feed^ them without any trouble or labor of theirs: but
when they are grown fledge, and have fea^ there is and wings, the damme^ provoke
them to fly abroad to seek their own living, and tha^ they now leave that
vnperfect^ and idle life, and begin a better.

After the same manner o^ good God deals with his spirit ritual children, who
as he is the author both of nature and grace; s^ in both of them he works
afte^ one and the self same manner But for this change, the devotion and love
of good men towarde^ God must not be diminished: but rather increased, and
changed for the better: for albeit that love is more sweet, yet this ^s
stronger: that more fervent, ^his more peaceable: that grea^er in the flesh,
this greater in ^he spirit; that a man may say with the Apostle: Although we
^aue known Christ after the flesh, 2. Cor. 5.
^et now henceforth know we him ^o more.

When a man comes to ^his estate, now he faints no more in tribulations,
albeit the consolations themselves do fail: ^ea he does diligently watch, and
is very careful over himself; whether the consolations ^e sent, or no.

To this degree of perfec^on all the lovers of God ought ^o aspire: which if at
length they ^ttain unto, let them render to the Lord most hearty thanks, who
has delivered them out of the swaddling bands of infantes, and has brought
them to an estate more safe and secure. The child grew, says the Scripture,
and was Genesis 21.
weaned: and Abraham made a great feast that same day, that Isaac was weaned.
We are diligently to note in this place, that the Patriarch did not make a
feast that day the child was born, when the whole family did rejoice for the
birth of Isaac, but that day when he was weaned, when he cried for his mothers
dugge. How much more excellent a banquet will tha^ eternal Father make, when
he^ see his children weaned from al^ pleasures, not only carnal an^ worldly,
but also spiritual? Ther^ shall be great joy in heaven, sayt^ Luke 15.
the Lord, in the presence of the Angels of God, for one sinner that conuerteth
albeit the vine be but yet in the bud, and be easily nipped of a small frost.
But when it has escaped that danger, and begins to bring forth clusters of
grapes, then the Angels do sing Psalms of degrees: for then the soul is
joined by a direct orderto the first degree of perfection, even to the last.

The first degree is to work, and to persevere in well doing, until comfort
be found: and the ^ast is, to do the same, whether consolations be enjoyed or
not enjoyed. For the soul that loves God truly, can do nothing more
acceptable unto him, then patiently to suffer, if God at any time ^ake away
that sweetness and pleasantnes of his taste. It is manifest, that David had a
great care of ^his, when he protested by ^his Divine consolation, saying;
Lord, if I have been high minded, Psalm. 131.
or exercised my self in great matters, that are to high for me, the^ let my
soul be even as a weaned child. Which is, as if he should say, if I be not
humble, let thy scourge come upon me, that I may be lef^ and forsaken of thee,
none other^ wise then a child that is weane^ and put from his mothers breasts.

How great then shall the perfection of that soul be, which coming to the
breasts of diuin^ consolations, finds them many times as it thinks dry an^
barren, and yet patiently bearet^ it, and nevertheless continuet^ in innocence?

Therefore it is no marvel, (...) there be joy in Heaven in the preasence of
Angels, when they see the righteous destitu^ of all comfort upon the eart^
for they see Isaac taken out (...) his swaddling clothes, put from ^is dugge,
and by little and little to grow a perfect man. God is wont to bestow upon
men, that are come to this degree, part of his secrets, as vp^n them, that are
perfect: according to that excellent testimony of Esaias;

Whom shall God teach know^dge? and whom shall he make Esaias. 28.
^o understand the things that he ^eareth? them that are weaned ^om the
milk, and drawn from ^be breasts: that is, them that for ^e love of God have
renoun^ed all pleasures, not only ^emporall, but also spyrituall.

For these and such like cau^s God oftentimes wythdraw^h from his servants
spiry^all consolations: by which ^asons it appears that it is often done
without the fault o^ man, as the spouse her self test^ fieth in the Canticles,
in these words; I opened to my well-beloved Cant. 5.

before.

men out of the East, did not always go before them: but sometimes did hide it
self, and a little after was seen again: yet both was for their benefit.
When it first ^ppeared, it invited them to the worship of the new King; when
^t appeared not, it made the^ more ^ilige^t in searching out the place, where
this new King should be ^orne: and when it appeared a^aine, it doubled their
joy, and led ^em the right way, until it stood ^er the house, in which Christ
^as.

But what do I speak of the ^r hid from the Wisemen, when (...) Christ a
child of twelve years ^d withdrew himself from most ^ocent Mary? what had she
de^ued that she should loose her ^ne? But the mother lost him (...) our
comfort: sought him for (...) example, and found him for our health and cure.
She sought him with grief and diligence: found him with ineffable joy and
gladness, neither was her love diminished in either, yea it increased, although
after a differen^ manner: for in his absence he^ desire increased, and in his
presence her joy.

After this manner the true Su^ of righteousness does often arise and come unto
us: and somtime^ again he goes out of our climat^ yet both is for our good,
and for the repayring and amendment o^ our life.

cold, and to be hardened, as to b^ softened and kept warm, yet ne^ there of
these hurts it: for by the cold and hardness it takes deep^ rooting in the
earth; and by the sons and heat it increases and spro^ teth above the
earth. If all the time the grain had been kept warm, it would have had no
rooting downwards, so that a small wind would have overthrown it. So that
both of these is necessary, one ye it may sprout above the earth, the other y^
it may take deep rooting downwards. Both seasons are necessary for our souls,
that they may increase in cha^itye, and be rooted in humi^ity. As often as
they wax cold and dry, they know their ^ouerty, and are made more hum^le.
But when they are visited ^f God, they taste of his ineffa^le sweetness, and
are fur^er kindled and inflamed by his ^ue.

Seeing therefore that it behoo^th a man both to know God ^d himself (for the
one know^dge without ye other is not sufficient) it is needful that there be
two seasons, assigned for these two knowledges: one in which man may know by
experience his own misery: the other in which by the same experience he may
learn to know the divine mercy, that by this knowledge he may be more lifted
up to the love of God, and by the other that he may more basely account of
himself.

By this it is manifest, how grievously they err, who relinquishe^ their
exercise, and utterly cast it off, when as by and by they find not divine
consolations, when they seek for them, and when they desire them.

It is monstrous and shamefu^ that any one should wish tha^ God should be
pinned to h^ sleeue, and bound to him wit^ a chain, that so often as h^ list
he may pull him by the sleeue: so that if he be not forthwith present with
him, he will seek for him no more.

Worthyly did that holy widow Judith blame them, who had set down a time,
when God should help them, in which time, if he did not succor them, they
decreede to look for his aid no longer.

Who are you, says she, that have tempted God? this manner of dealing Judith.

is not the way to procure mercy, but rather to provoke anger, and kindle
fury. Do you appoint a time for the mercy of the Lord? and set down a day,
when he should deliver you?

They are worthy of the ^ame reprehention, who present^y would find God, as
soon as ^hey seek for him: and unless forthwith they find him, by and by
they despair, neither vouchsafe they to seek for him any further.

WHAT A MAN ought to do, when as the current of the divine consolations is
stayed. CHAP. XXXI.
When as thou see thy selfedestitute of divine consolations, thou must not
intermit nor break off thine accustomed exercise of prayer, albeit it seem
unsavory unto thee. Yea then thou must come before the presence of the Lord, as
one guilty and culpable, to examine, and with great diligence to search thine
own conscience, and to make inquisition, whether it be thy fault that thou
have lost the co^forts of the holy Ghost. Which if thou find to be so, cast
thy self humbly before his feet with that holy sinner, and fear with the
Publican to lift up thine eyes to heaven: cast thy self upon the bowels of his
infinite love, and beseech him with great trust and confidence, that he would
pardon thee, and show thee the riches of his mestimable patience and mercy: as
well in expecting, as in pardoning him, of whom so often he has been
provoked to anger. If thou will do this, thou shall, extract and draw fruit
out of thy dryness, yea out of thine offense; ^hereby taking occasion to
^aumble thy self, whylst thou ^eest the greatness of thy ^innes; and further
cause of greater love to God, whilst thou see how many and how great sins
he has forgiven thee. And also thou shall be more wary and circumspect
afterward, that thou sleep not, or be secure in the fight, when it goweth on:
for this is the usual and common commoditity, which the righteous receive by
their falls.

And although in thine exer^ We must do that in prayer that we may.
cises thou feel no sweetness, yet thou must not abstain from the^: for it
is not necessary, that it should always be sweet, which is profitable: for
oftentimes the contrary happens.

What shall become of the sic^ and weak, if they wholly abstain^ from meat,
because they find^ no savor in it? it is requisite tha^ sometimes they eat
without taste^ that by little and little togethe^ with their health, they may
recoue^ their taste. This experience teaches, that a man, as often as he
continues in prayer with some attentiuenes and diligence, doing that little he
can, that at length he goes away joyful and full of consolation: seeing that
little he did for his part, and understanding that he can do much before the
Lord, who does all that he can, although it be but little.

That poor Widdowe cast no more into the treasury but Luke. 21.
two mites, and yet by the sentence of Christ she is extolled above all the
rich, who cast in much more. For the Lord respects not the quantity of the
gift offered, but especially the ability and ^vill of the giver. He gives much
who desires to give enough, who gives that he has, who keeps nothing to
himself, who omitteth nothing that lies in him.

What great matter is it to pray, when many consolations are present? every
worldly man can do this.

It is a hard thing when the devotion is small, then to power forth longer
prayers, to have greater humility patience, and perseverance in good works.
The cheifest commendation of a Pilot A Simily.
of a ship is not in that he know eth well to guide his vessel, when the sea is
calm: but when a tempest approaches, then to know how to give sail, and how
to take it in, how to guide the stern, how to man his ship, how to conquer
fortune by diligence, an^ by art to overcome the fury o^ the wind, this is
praise worthy i^ deed. When consolation; are absent we must watch the more
diligently.


Secondly, it is necessary the at that time, there be great^ fear and
diligence in thee, the at other times: for then we must stand upon our watch,
and upon our court of guarde: our words, works, thoughts, and whatsoever is
ours is then to be examined and searched into. For because spiritual joy does
then fail us, which in this our Navigations is the chiefest oar, it is to be
supplied with diligence and attention; although this also be grace, and that
not the least. When thou see thy self in this estate, thou must look (as
Saint Bernarde says) whether the sentinelles, which did keep thee, do sleep:
^or whether the wall is fallen ^downe, which did defend thee, ^or then all thy
hope is to be pla^ed in thy weapons.

For then the wall will not de^ende thee, but thy weapons, and thy skill in
fighting.

O how great is the glory of that soul, which defends her self without a
shield, and fights without weapons, is strong without fortitude, and fighting
only receives strength without help.

Among all the valiantes and worthies of David, Benaiah is especially 2. Sam.
23.
praised, who slew a Lion in the time of snow. It is great glory to kill a
Lion; but much greater to kill him in winter time, when the hands are benumbed
with cold, so that they can scarcely brandish a swoorde. Wherefore when the
soul is altogether cold and frozen, neither feels any heat of charity in
her: yet if she at that time fight valiantly with the roaring Lion, and
overcome him, is she^ not worthy to be numbered wit^ the valiants of David, that
is, wit^ the worthies of Jesus Christ? There is no greater praise in this
^orlde, then to imitate the ver^es of our Savior: but among ^is virtues it is
reckoned a chief ^ne, that he bare those things, which he suffered, having not
the ^ast comfort in the inferior part ^f his soul. He therefore that so
^uffereth, and so fights, shall by (...) much be a more perfecter imi^atour of
Christ, as he is further ^ff from all consolation.

This is to drink of the pure cup ^f obedience, which is not mi^ed with any
other liquor, which ^ight mitigate the bitterness of (...), but only with the
strength of ^ertue.

This is that true touchstone, by which is tried who is gold, and who is lead:
who is Gods true ^iend, and who is false.

AGAINST THEM that contemn and deride divine consolations. CHAP. XXXII.
ALL that, which hithert^ has been spoken, is nece^sary to heal their
grief, wh^ despair, and faint in heart, when a sensible devotion (as they ca^
it) is denied unto them, and a sp^ rituall consolation. But becau^ our
wickedness and peruersen^ is so great, that oftentimes o^ medicine it makes a
poyso^ whilst that it applies that to a^ other, which was purposed f^ this
disease; we are to admoni^ in this place, that that which (...) thereto has
been spoken, ha^ not been said, that thereby men ^ould become more cold and
^egligent: but only, that cou^ge and strength may be given ^o those, who are
fainthearted and ^strustfull. For there be some, ^ho out of this doctrine take
an ^ccasion to contemn, and basely ^ccount of divine consolations, ^d
exercises, by which they are ^btained, saying, that the sancti^ and perfection
of a christian ^e, does not consist in spiritual ^nsolations, but in virtue. A
Least men should condemn themselves, they contemn divine consolations.
^an does hate nothing more, ^en to be condemned by his ^wne sentence: and
because proud ^en, who never tasted, what god (...) should be condemned by that
which they are, if it be true, that ^y sanctity be placed in divine
^nsolations: therefore they have and a mean to extenuate and ^ntemne them,
least they should have that in themselves, which might confound themselves,
seeing themselves naked and so fa^ off from all these consolation^ Miserable
are ye, because ye ta^ not, how sweet the Lord is, b^ much more wretched are
yee^ who that ye may excuse yo^ negligence, do so we the poyso^ of a new
error, darkening the light of truth, that your own^ malitiousnesse may not be
seen^ and so you hide the key of wis^ dome and knowledge, neyth^ entering your
selves into heaven, nor suffering others to e^ ter, for ye shut the way again^
them with two errors, which y^ have learned in the school (...) your own
negligence.

Tell me, with what colour^ ye flourish over this your d^ ctrine, that ye make
so small a^count of spiritual consolation^ ^member that this doctrine is ^or
delivered to the negligent and ^outhfull (as ye be) but to ^ose, that be
faint-hearted and ^eake, who presentlye are dis^uraged, if they find not that
^elpe. If an arrogant and a pre^mptuous man should feel in ^mselfe that
comfort and strength which by the virtue of Gods lord is given unto the
fearful, ^d to them that are of a small ^th, to what other thing should
profit him, but that thereby he ^ay be made the worser? If a other should lay

manner these wicked men do pervert al^ good and wholesome doctrines abusing
them for themselves which are delivered for others always very studiously
endeuou^ ring to defend the looseness an^ dissolutenes of their life.

Ye say that sanctity consistet Divine co^solations for what they are
profitable.
not in spiritual consolations Surely it is true, that sanctity co^ sisteth
not in them, but yet the^ bring a great help unto sanctity perfection is not
placed in the^ but yet they are principal instr^ments for the attaintment of
pe^fection.

Ye say that these consolation are rather a part of the reward then of the
desert. And this is (...) so true: but this reward bei^ seen, and tasted by
experien^ does kindle, and stir up (...) heart to labors, and that the
desire to attain so great good. For even as a stone is mo^ed A Simily.
more swiftly, when it appro^heth nearer his ce^ter (as the Phi^sophers say)

natuall place: so also man's heart crea^d of God, is more strongly mo^ed, when it
now begins to ^ele and taste somewhat of his ^reator.

Ye say that the perfection of a ^hristian life is not placed in man
consolations, but in bearing ^tiently, when they are denied. neither can I deny
this: but to^ther with this patience great ^igence must be joined: that the
^ace lost may be recovered, that ^al times we may be ready for ^e divine
worship and ministry. ^r unless there had been great ^ckes and motives,
which stir a man with great alacritye to run the way of the Lord, t^
Prophet David had not said; have run the way of thy comma^dements, Psalm. 119.

our heart is enlarged, and st^ red up to all good. For as nature pleasure is
the principal moti^ and cause of all the actions of n^ ture: so spiritual
pleasure is t^ cause of a^l the actions of gra^ Therefore it is said of the P^

There fore that I may concl^ and shut up this matter, I sa^ that it
behooves us so to wa^ between these two extream^ that when the grace of the
di^ consolations is absent, we (...) not discourage our selves, distrust God:
neither that we be together secure and careless, ^hen we have lost it, but
that we ^e and suffer all things, and do that lies in us, that we may ^couer
it again.

^F THE SECOND ^emptation, that is, of the war of importunate and outrageous
thoughts. CHAP. XXXIII.
^like manner the troubles and ^arre of importunate and vn^ly thoughts is a
grievous ^ptation, and not much diffe^g from the former, which ^ffle in
themselves in the time ^raier, and do cause a man now and then to forsake his
exercise and this is that, which the deuil^ seeks for in this his tempta^tion.

Why this punishment is infli^cted upon men I know not, vnle^ perhaps, because
they are men^ for this weakness of our natu^ is bred and borne with the
estate^ which we now live in. For man nature through sin is so diso^ dered,
that the inferior power and faculties of our soul do no^ perfectly obey the
superior pa^ where the will and the reason are.

Hence it is that the sensual ap^ petite does oftentimes vex an^ trouble the
superior part wi^ many passions and desires, neither have we power to curb
an^ Our imagination oftentimes slippeth out of doors we being against it.
conquer these first motions. O^ imagination also, which is an^ there faculty of
our soul, doe^ sometimes steal away, and privily slip out of the house
without leave or license, we perceauing it, and yet not able to hinder ^t.
This is so natural and famili^r, that albeit men be grown to some perfection
yet they cannot ^e altogether free from this passion. All the plagues of Egypt
were either taken away, or mi^igated by the prayer of Moses; ^et we do not read
that the gnats and flies were taken away: that ^hereby might be insinuated,
that ^lthough men grow to some per^ection of life, that they rid them^elues of
foul and enormous sins, ^etthese gnats and flies, which are ^ore importunate,
then hurtful, ^re not altogether taken away.

Sometimes also these vnseaso^able and inconvenient thoughts ^oe happen unto us
through our ^wne actual fault and will, and then also are we worthyly
punished, for there is never fitter time nor place for punishment, then where
there is a fault and an offense.

We must here note, that as in other conditions and natural proprieties, one is
more vehemen^ then another: for there is no less^ difference of minds, then of
cou^^ tenances (in which nature shew^ eth great variety and art) so als^ this
importunity and outragiou^ nes of thoughts is naturally more troublesome to
one, then to an^ there: yet he that is more tro^ bled and vexed, and weaker
(...) make resistance must not dispai^ but contrarily pluck up his sp^rits:
for by how much men a^ the poorer, so much more (...) tle and right have they,
the rich men, to crave aid and (...) leeue at places of hospitality a^
succor: so he that is more afflicted and troubled, has iuster cause to
desire aid and help at the bounty of the Divine mercy.

For the Apostle says, that the Romans 8.
^oly Ghost, who very well know^th how little we can do, does ^elpe our
infirmity, and that so ^uch the more, by how much ^ur necessity craves it, as
a good A Simily.
^oushoulder does, who gives to ^is sick servant more dayntye ^eates, then
he does to the ^st, not because he is worthy^ then the rest, but because ^e
is weaker, and in greater ^ed.

For these causes we conclude, at a man ought not too much afflict himself
with grief, when ^is set upon by these vagabond ^d disordred thoughts, but
^ke by all means by calling upon God to expel them, which if he does, they
shall not so much offend God, as move him unto mercy and compassion, whilst he
sees how foully our nature is corrupted by sin, that scarcely we can lift up
our hearts to heaven, but presently unclean thoughts do depresse it, and draw
it downwards. For which cause we must think, that as a father, who has A
Simily.
a lunatike and a frantike son does lament and grieve, when he hears his son
to talk wisely wi^ him, and presently sees him fal^ out of his wits, and
run madde^ so also that our heavenly father does grieve and lament (if so i^
could be) when he sees the corruption of our nature to be so great, that in
that very time, we are talking wisely with him, forthwith we run here and
there, an^ vage and wander through a thou^ sand cogitations. He therefore that
will go to prayer, ought before all things to cast away all wandering
thoughts, and vain cares, and alone without a companion ascend with Moses
into ^he mountain, that he may ^alke with God, and the door of Math 6.
^is chamber being shut (as our Savior says) he must pray to ^is father
in secret. But if for all ^his, the gnats and flies, that we ^aue spoken of,
come to annoy he: do as in times past Abra^am Genesis 15.
did, who when he offered a ^acrifice unto God, and the fowls ^escended upon
the sacrifice, he ^riue them away, that he might ^eepe his sacrifice clean. If
thou ^alt do the same, be assured, that ^ou shall exceedingly please god ^y
this sight, and that God will ^entifully show the riches of his ^odnes unto
thee.

And the Devil, who came merry to this combat, shall return, from whence he
came sorrowful and confounded: and he that would have destroyed thee, shall
give thee an occasion of greater glory.

Wherefore if thy mind be chaste and pure, if thou come not to God, to
satisfy thine own will, but for love of him, neither respectest the house of
thy beloved, but the beloved himself, there is no cause, why thou should be
sad and sorrowful; for he will give thee what thou desire, and that which
best pleases him, although it be not altogether so delectable. We must here
note that this combat and strife wit^ these cogitations ought not to b^ done
with too much labor, and to^ much reluctation of spirit, as some unwisely do,
who think that the^ can cure this inconvenience with great and vehement
endeavors and striuings: and they do so plunge and turmoyle themselves in this
combat, that at the length they weary and hurt both heart and head.

Whence it comes, that they cannot long continue in prayer: and when they
have once forsaken it, they naturally abhor it, and are afraid to return
unto it, as to a thing full of grief and labor.

This is a very great error: for it is not a business of force and vyolence,
but rather of hu^ility and grace: Therefore it is ^he best remedy for a man in
this ^ase, that he co^fidently turn himself unto the Lord, and humbly say; ^rd
respect who I am? what do ^hou respect of this dung, but a ^lthy and stinking
smell? what do thou look for of this earth, cursed of thy mouth, and
excommunicated of thee, but thorns and briers? For this is the fruit, which
it is wont to bring forth, unless thou O Lord otherwise command. After
that he has thus spoken let him return to his former exercise, and let him
expect with patience the visitation of the lord, who is not wont to be slow.

But that this may be understood the better, we must observe in this place,
that our heart is like a morish and fenny lake, which does send forth many
gross vapors, by which it does so darken the air, that scarce any thing can
be seen clearly in it: but when the Sun arises, by little and little those
vapors are dissolved, and vanish away, and the heaven becomes fair and
clear. Ou^ heart is of the same nature, an^ must have the same remedy to
dissipate and disseuer the clouds and mists of cogitations, proceeding from it.

Therefore it is very profitable counsel, that we do not forthwith discourage
our selves, when these gross fogges and mistes do appear, but that we be
patient and long suffering: for by little and little the heat of Devotion will
^arise in our soul, which when it ^s entered in, it will dissolve the fogges
and mistes of cogitations, and will make the heaven of our ^eart clear and
fair. Which being done, tranquillity will ensue, and quietness and rest from al
for^er labor. They that dispatch ^eir business after this manner, do ^ot feel
in it any plague or pu^ishment, but rather peace and ^reat consolation: neither
do they ^efuse to return unto prayer again, as the former do, but scarcely
one prayer being ended, they forthwith think of another: and at the first
occasion they return unto it, as to a thing of great pleasure, other business
being either left alone, or speedily dispatched: for it is written, They that
eat me, shall have the more hunger, and they Eccl. 24.
that drink me, shall thirst the more. This then is the reason, why some fly
the labors of prayer, as a thing trouble some and tedious: and others persevere
in it, as in a thing delightful and pleasant: which they very well know, who
have learned that by experience, which in this place we have taught.

OF THE THIRD TEMPtation, to wit, of the cogitations of blasphemy, and
infidelity. CHAP. XXXIIII.
THere are also other cogitations more dangerous, and more importunate then
the former: which especially are wont ^o set upon those, who first enter unto
this way: and they be the cogitations of infidelity, and blasphemy. For
carnalmen, whose cogitations and desires are wholly car^al, albeit they be
converted unto ^he Lord, yet by and by they cannot ^orget the figures and
similitudes ^f those things, which they have ^eene in the world. For as Rachell
when she went out of her country took away with her the idols of her fathers
house: so these albe. it they go out of the world, do yet carry with them the
images and figures of the world: and when they give themselves to the
contemplation of spiritual things, forth with carnal and worldly matters
do represent themselus unto them.

There be some that are so scandalized by this temptation, an^ do receive so
great hurt by it, tha^ they suppose themselves to be cast^ awayes, and that
they are vtterl^ reprobated of God, seeing them selves to be impugned and a^
saulted with so horrible and fea^ full temptations, and now an^ then to be
over come by them and this is without doubt a v^ ry great error. For by ho^
much a man is further off from consenting unto this temptati^ ^or taking
delight in it, by so much ^s he further off from the fault: for ^ll the danger
of this temptation ^s placed in the delight and con^enting to it.

Therefore it is not a sign of ^eprobation but these temptati^ns are natural
causes pursuing that estate, in which man lives, and laying hold of the
disposition and habit of man's heart. We see ^y daily experience, that if any
^oysome or stinking thing has ^ong layen in a house or shop, that the stink
remains, albeit ^he thing that made it be cast out ^f doors. Neither is it
marvel, if ^man smell of that, he always ^ateth, or if he speak that idiome
and dialect of speech which he ^ath always used: yea we are to ^inke, that as
the habit to think ^lwaies evil things, does so bind ^man, that he cannot
think of good things: so on the contrary part the use and custom of good
things does so change a man that he thinks not on evil things. In like
manner at ye very beginning many thoughts of faith are wont to impugn and
fight We are not toonarrowly to prye into those things, which are too high for
us.
against a man, especially against the understanding of curious men, not yet
mortified: to whom it happens, as to a plain and simple country man, who
coming into the palace of a King, where are great store of fair rooms, and
rich furniture, A Simily.
he cannot sufficiently wonder at them, having never seen the like before, and
enquireth what is this? and what is that? So a man that bends himself to know
al things, and to measure every thing by the rule of his reason and not by the
square of faith; and that accustometh not himself to exceed the lymits and
capacity of nature; when he is brought on a sudden ^o view the palace of King
Salo^on, the greatness of his mysteries, and the wonders of his royal ^ouse, he
finds so many nouels ^o far exceeding the capacity of ^is reason, that he
does not cease ^o wonder and to demand of himself; What is this? and what is
that? what need was it for God (...) make man, and so to suffer him? (...) such
like things.

These be the considerations, ^ese be the base and ignoble ^uestions of this
rude and rustic ^ountrey man, accustomed to ^is sheep coats, and now
eneuouring to measure the great ^onders and deep misteryes of ^e Divine
Wisdom, by the ^easure of those things he was ^ed unto.

Therefore it is necessary, that man being mindful of his bas^ and abject
condition, do always think, that it is very great presumption, to go about
to measur^ God by himself, and to compar^ divine things with humane. For the
magnitude of the diuin^ things is so great and so wonderful, that not only it
exceedet^ all that which man can do, b^ all that he can understand, or
comprehend in his mind. Further more, as there is an infinite d^ stance
between to be Divine, and to be created: so is there an i^ finite distance
between the operations of them both: for as the essence is, so is the manner
of operation.

Solomon was a very wise man yet he confesses that man can not give a sound
reason of an^ thing made of God, although (...) be but small: how then shall h^
yield a reason of the works of ^ace that cannot render a reason ^f the works
of nature, when as ^ese are much more excellent ^en those?

As thou know not, says he, which is the way of the spirit, nor Eccles. 1^.
^we the bones do grow in the ^ombe of her that is with child, Hierome
adds) nor how of one ^se element the body of man is ^gested into diverse
shapes and joints, ^d how of the same seed one part ^commeth flesh, an other
bones, an^her veins, and another sinews: thou know not the work of ^d
that works all.

Therefore man considering is, he ought with all humilitye speak unto himself
these ^ordes of the Wiseman; If we Wised. 9.
(...) hardly discern the things that ^e upon the earth, and with great ^our
find out the things which are before us, who then can seek^ out the things
that are in heaven (...) who can know the counsel of God (...) or who can
understand what Go^ will do?

But what marvel is it that (...) man cannot search out, nor find^ out the
works of the divine arte^ when as oftentimes he cannot co^prehende the works of
other me^^ who are of the same nature wit^ him? If one, says Chrysostom
should show to another a vesse^ of excellent fine glass, who ha^ never seen
glass before, and shul^ say unto him; This beautiful and clear vessel was
made of a ce^ taine kind of straw, and of san^ and that which is more, only
b^ the blast of man: the other would neither understand him nor be^ leeue him,
how it could possibl^ be. If then man cannot vnderstan^ the art and cunning of
other me^ whythen presumes he to find out ^e art and cunning of that Lord,
^ho as he is called Wonderful, (...) also all his works are wonder^ll?

But what do I speak of the ^orkes of other men? Tell me ^ow Bees do build
their honny ^mbes, and temper their honny? ^owe a spider does weaue her ^ebbe?
or how a silk worm ^oth spinne her silk?

Wherefore if thou vnderandest not the works of ^ormes, nor can imytate,
that they do, why dooest ^ou in vain toss and tur^oyle thy self, to search
^t and comprehend in thine ^derstandinge the Dyuyne ^orkes.

Therefore we have here need (...) great discretion, that man con^dering on
the one part, how base his nature is, and on the ^ther of what excellency the
Divine nature is, he may follow the counsel of Ecclesiasticus, saying: Seek
not out the things that are Eccle. 3.
too hard for thee, neither search the things rashly which are too mighty for
thee. But what God has commanded thee, think upon that with reverence, and be
not curious in many of his works: for it is not needful for thee, to see with
thine eyes the things that are secret. Be not curios in superfluous things, for
many things are showed unto thee about the capacity of men.

Therefore he that would enter into that sanctuary of the divine How the divine
works are to be looked into.
works, he must enter with great humility and reverence, having the eyes of a
simple dove, and not of a crafty serpent: having the heart of a simple
disciple, and not of a rash judge. Be thou a tender infant: for to such God is
wont to teach his secrets. Do not ^emaund in every thing why God ^hus made this
and that. For this word Why is the word of the ser^ent, and the beginning of
our ^estruction.

Shut thine eyes of reason, and ^pen thine eyes of faith: for faith (...) the
instrument, by which alone ^iuine things are to be contem^ated and searched
into. For the ^nsideration of humane works, ^e eye of reason is profitable: ^t
in divine matters it is rude ^d unprofitable, unless it be ay^d by heavenly
grace.

Although all these things ge^rally pertain to all men, yet ^ore especially
they belong unto ^ung beginners, who as young ^ollers and children must before
(...) things believe; afterward ^owing more expert and ripe, then they may
more safely d^mine and judge. For as a child^ A Simily.

his Ass. When ^hey came that should have buri^d him, they found the carcass

the ^ower of that roaring Lion is ^strayned, and how it is bound ^ithin lymits,
and how that he ^n extend his power no further, ^en God gives him leave.

And what shall I speak of the ^atch and ward of Angels, who are The watch and

feared, seeing the house of his master begirt of enemies. And the Lord opened
his eyes, and he saw, and behold the mountain was full of horses, and of
fiery Chariots for the safeguard and defense of Eliseus. Albeit thou be not a
Prophet, it is sufficient that thou live in the fear of God, that thou may
be partaker of his safeguard and custody, according to that of the Prophet, The
Angel of the Lord pitcheth round about Psalm. 34.

The devils do very well know the strength of this guard, and therefore one of
the^ talking with God said: Does Job fear god for naught* Job. 1.
Have thou not made an hedge abo^ him and about his house, and abo^ all that he
has on every side? the none can hurt him.

Look how the elder brethren do carry their younger brethren: A Simily.
when they are but little ones, in their arms, and how they do The Angels

^eep them with great care and ^rouidence: after the same man^er those happy
spirits, which are ^s our elder brethren, do keep and ^end us, who are as
their younger ^rethren, and little ones, and do ^arry us in their arms, as
David ^yth: He has given his Angels Psalm. 91.

their hands, that thou hurt not ^y foot against a stone. But it is ^ut a small
thing to have Angels ^eare us in their hands, see^g that the Lord himself,
our ^reator does it, as the Prophet ^stifieth, saying: I led Ephraim Osee. 11.
^so, as one should bear them in his ^mes, but they knew not that I ^aled them.

This is the same which he speaks by his Prophet Zacharte: He that touches
you, touches the apple Zach. 2.
of mine eye. And in the same Prophet he says, that he will be unto us a wall
of fire compassing us in on every side. What then do thou fear o man, being
fortified with such a wall? do thou think it meet that thou should rather
credit thy dreams and fantasies, then believe the divine works and promises?

Prayer ought to make thy mind more secure, then any other exercise: for where
Prayer is, there (according to the judgment of the best divines) are the Angels
especially present, that they may help us in our prayer, that they may
transport our prayers into the presence of the Lord, that they may defend us
from our enemy, and from all others, which might disturb that holy silence,
according to that which the Bridegroom says in the Canticles; I charge you, O
daugh^ers of Jerusalem, by the roes and by Cant. 2.
^he hindes of the field, that ye stir ^ot up, nor waken my love, until she
^lease. In which words silence is ^ot only imposed upon the di^els, but also
upon all other crea^ures of the world, that they di^urbe not the spouse of
Christ, and her sweet sleep of contem^lation: and also the authority ^f the
holy Angels is inserted, ^ho are understood by the roes ^d hindes, as well for
their ^iftnes, as for their quicknes of ^derstanding, as Saint Bernarde ^yth.

These and such like things are (...) be meditated upon of those ^at be
fearful, not only when ^re does set upon them; but also when they are
without fear, for seeing that the affection proceeds from error, and false
surmise; if so the knowledge of truth has taken up the haven before, error
and lies shall find no footing in it.

THE FIRST TEMPtation is to much sleep. CHAP. XXXVI.
Sleep also is wont to be tro^ blesome to many in the ti^ Diverse causes of
sleep.
of prayer. Sometimes it proceed^ of necessity, sometimes of in^mity, sometimes
of slouthfuln^ and sometimes it is sent of (...) devil, to whom nothing is
mo^ acceptable, then that this go^ may be hindered.

When it arises of necessity, that is not to be denied to the body, which is
his: least in like manner it hinder that, which is ours. For great is the force
of nature, and it will not be defrauded of things belonging unto it. when it is
bred of infirmity, let not a man trouble or vex himself, for it is not his
fault; neither let him be altogether overcome of it, but let him for his part
do what he may, now using some industry, now and then some violence; that
his prayer may not altogether slack, without which nothing in this life can be
possessed safely.

But when it proceeds of idle^es, or is sent of the devil, the^ another
remedyis to be used: to wit, ^asting, or some other austerity of ^ife, which
does prick and stir up the ^lesh, y^ so sleep may be shaken off.

But especially fasting does help: for sleep, and meat are almost always
joined together, and do go together: so y^ after too much meat follows too
much sleep, and after moderate diet, moderate sleep: so much as is withdrawn
from meat, so much in a manner is taken from sleep. It is written of Saint
Basil, that oftentimes he passed over whole nights without sleep; for he was
very temperate in his diet. And this was the cause why the Saints could watch
so much, and so long, for they were great fasters.

To be brief it is a very great remedy for this evil, as also for all others,
to crave aid and help of him, who is always ready to give it unto them that
ask it. For this providence is denied to no creature, whether it be in the
sea, or upon the earth, much less shall it be denied to man being created
after his image and likeness. Therefore let us be humble and faithful, and let
us persevere in craving mercy, which if we do, he will faithfully give us,
that we desire: according to that; A carnal man crediteth the law of God, and
the law is faithful unto him. For the promises of God do not deceive him, to
whom faith and hope are not wanting. This is that which I thought good to
speak of, too much sleep, which is to be avoided not only for the love of
prayer, but also for the time, which is unprofitably spent in it. For if one
^dle word be a sin, and such a ^inne, that an account is to be ren^red of it
at the day of judgment: ^ow is it credible, that an ac^ount of time shall not be
exacted, which any one spends so vn^rofitably in sleeping? in which time many
exercises acceptable to God might have been performed. And also according to
the rule of Physicians, six or seven hours are sufficient to satisfy
corporal necessity.

Wherefore then O Christian, do thou consume whole winter nights in thy bed
(every one of which are as years,) snorting, sleeping, and unprofitably
passing over the time? turning and tossing thy self from one place to an other
no otherwise the^ a door is turne^ upon the hindges, now upon this sid^ and now
upon that; when in y^ mean^ season in thy mind thou mighte^ walk throughout
heaven, view the Angels, and meditate upon the glory of God? But this is
worser, the nowsuch an evil custom is gro^en in the world, that no man su^
poseth it a sin, nor feels in (...) conscience so great loss of tim^
wherein by sleeping he loses so many good things, which by watching he
might gain unto himself.

OF DESPAIR, AND presumption, which are the sixth and seventh temptations. CHAP.
XXXVII.
THe former of these temptations is Despair, which tel^eth thee that it is
impossible, that ^ou should grow to such per^ctio^, and ascend to such an
height: therefore by discouraging thee, (...) constrains thee to leave off
^ine enterprise. The other temp^tion i^ presumption, which is ^ontrary unto
Despair, and it ^erswadeth thee, that thou have already finished thy course,
and that thou art come to an end, when as scarcely thou art well entered. By
both of them thou art defrauded of thy wished end. Therefore it is requisite
that thou be armed on the right hand with hope, and on the left with fear:
that that as a prick may stir thee up to run thy course, and this as a
bridle may temperate and moderate thy pace.

If thou will overcome desperation: which arises either of the infirmity of
thine own strength, or of the difficulty of the work, consider that this
task^ is bequeathed unto thee not o^ thine own industry, but of the Divine
bounty, and therefore more confidently trust that thou shall so much the more
be strengthened to walk in it, by how much thine own strength does fail the^
Wherefore this impediment shall ^e of great use unto thee: for it is ^ecessarye
that altogether thou ^istrust in thy self, if thou hopest (...) reach unto
this perfection. therefore if this wretch Despair ^oth whisper in thine ear,
that ^ou art insufficient, and there^re that ought not to enter in^ the
tract of this path, make an^were that through thine own ^sufficiency thou art
much more (...) to receive the divine help and ^sistance, to which there is
no^ing impossible or difficult. If ^ou have after this manner long ^ontinued in
prayer, and see thy ^lfe not any thing to have profi^ed, and therefore now
beginnest (...) discourage thy self, think ^ith thy self, that God does
of^ntimes withhold his grace, that (...) may be better known to be his (...),
and that he may be more bountiful in giving. For an argument of which,
consider how out of women a long time barren he brought forth most excellent
and famous men, as Isaac, Sampson, Samuel, John Baptist, and many others. By
which example comfort thy self, for oftentimes the labor of many years is
discovered in one day.

If thine own frailty, the Devils force, the iniquity and malignitie of the
present time, and whatsoever else may drive thee backwards, do terrify thee;
consider that there are many more, which are on thy side, both in number and
valor. So we read of Eliseus, who when he saw himself compassed about with
the host of his enemy, he feared not as his servant G^hazi did, for he saw a
stronger army to come for his defense. And surely ^f thou did see all the
Angels, and God ^mselfe waiting at the end of ^y race, to give thee a crown:
^ou would not esteem nor ^eye it, if all hell should rise up against thee,
yea thou would ^ioyce, to be more furiously as^ulted, that thou might
show ^y self more hardy and vali^t, after the example of Paul, ^ho provoking
against him^lfe every creature, and stan^ing at defiance with them, ^yd: Who
shall separate me from Romans 8.
^e love of Christ? as if he should ^y, I know no force nor vio^ence either
upon the earth, ^r in heaven, that can draw me from him.

It is of no less danger to be ^erswaded, that thou art alrea^ie come to the
end, then it ^s to despair of it. Therefore ^yther also I will bring unto
thee a remedy. First thou mays^ out of this poison extract an antidote, and
make this argument* that then thou art the further o^ from the end, when thou
think^ est, that thou have already attay^ ed unto it.

For they that are almost at the end of their race, do more swi^ly hasten to
it, lightly weyin^ what they have attained in r^spect of that which remainet^
So Paul forgot those things the were behind: and by how mu^ he stretched out
himself towar^ those things that were before, b^ so much he was kindled with
(...) more fervent desire: as a stone (...) moved the more swiftly, the ne^rer
it approaches his center. Fu^thermore if thou think the that object to
which thou hast^ be infinite, always thou w^ deem thy self to be poor, n^
^y, and in want, albeit thou be ad^rned and enriched with many ^iftes and
graces. But if thou sup^ose that thou do possess thy ^lfe wholly, know that
thy mind ^id never taste of any thing, but of ^at which is finit.

I could bring many other do^mentes and instructions to cast ^owne our arrogant
presumption: ^t now I hasting to an end, this ^e precept I leave unto thee, ^at
if thou will see, how far thou ^t off from true prayer, view those ^en, that
have been famous and ^cellent contemplators, in com^rison of whom thou shall
see ^y self to be so far under them, ^a Pigmy is under a vast and huge ^yant.

That I may let pass the exam^e of Christ, because it dazeleth ^r eyes by
reason of the exceeding ^ghtnes. Veiwe but this one example of the Apostle S.
Paul, and consider of it well, and thou shall easily understand how far thou
come short of his perfection. Saint Paul was carried up to such an height,
that he himself knew not, whether he was in his body, or without his body.
Surely as he had ascended above all creatures, so also he had aspired beyond
himself, and was wholly swallowed up in God.

Anthony, when as many time^ he had passed the whole nigh^ in divine
contemplation, he complained when the day came, an^ said: O Sun, thou returnest
to^ soon unto us, and I am mad^ heavy by thy glimpse, because thou hinderest
me from the mos^ sweet conte^platio^ of the true So^

Hierome seemed in his soul^ to be carried out of the world and to enjoy the
company of Angels; and coming to himself ^gaine, he said, that it could not
^e expressed with humane tongue which he had seen.

Gregory, when he was aduan^ed to that high place of Bishop, ^e did none
otherwise lament, being taken from the sweet quiet ^f contemplation, and
carried in^o the turbulent storms of the world, then if a mariner should be
taken out of a quiet and calm ^auen, and violently be thrust into a raging and
cruel tempest.

Bernard oftentimes was so inward with himself, that he marked not where he
was: wherefore when on a day he had ridden over a river, he never remembered
that he had seen it.

If the Scripture say of the Queen of Saba, that there was no more spirit in
her, and that she 3. Reg. 10.
was greatly astonished, when she saw the works of Solomon: what shall be done
to that soul, whose eyes the holy Ghost opens, by that divine light, to see,
not the greatness of Salomons works, who was an earthly man, but the greatness
of the works of God, in which so many wonders are to be seen? I say, of
works, as well of nature, as of grace and glory?

By this thou easily perceiuest, how thou errest, in persuading thy self to
have attained that, thou have not, seeing that thou have so long a way to go,
and that thou ar^ so far off from the degree of thi^ perfection. And so by the
one tho^ shall be made more humble, se^ing how thou errest: and by the other
more diligent, seeing wha^ thou want if thou desire to b^ perfectly united
to him, who is (...) sea of an infinite magnitude.

THE EIGHT TEMP^ation is, a too greedy desire to be wise and learned. CHAP.
XXXVIII.
AFter all these temptations an other follows, which is so ^ch greater then
the former, as ^ath a greater color and show ^ertue, by which many men are
^eiued, especially they, that ^h an earnest zeal and desire do ^ke for the
common good. Of ^se we will now speak.

This desire, which does hold ^y so earnestly to their studies, (...) this
love of science and know^ge, under pretense to help o^s, is too much and
superfluous. ^ll it a love too much, and desire ^erfluous; for when it is
mode^, and according to reason, (...) not a temptation, but a lawdable virtue,
and a very profitable exercise, which is commended (...) all kind of men, but

All these are good a^ necessary; but unless they (...) moderately taken, they
are hu^ ^l, and bring damage. We say (...) same of too much study and ^eedines
of science and know^ge, which certainly is an vn^t stepdame unto prayer: for
^s study takes up all the time, ^d wholly possesses a man. For (...) a
certain Philosopher says) ^e is wise; for it manifests things, and makes
men wise. ^ke manner the study of prayer (...) contemplation takes up all (...)
time, and wholly possesses a (...), and requires that he be (...) from all

^e emulation between these (...) studies, whether ought to ^e the chiefest
part: neither is ^emulation lesser, then that (...) in times past between Leah
(...) Rachel, whether of them had ^e right to their husband.

Furthermore study (besides that it either requires the whole time or the
greater part of it, by reason of very many things, which are either to be
searche^ into, or to be meditated upon besides also the labor, which is t^ be
spent in it) it is also an exercis^ which (although it be very spec^latiue and
theoricke) is wont (...) dry up the remorse full tendern^ of the heart, and the
juice of D^uotion.

For together with business^ merely corporal, the spirit m^ also conveniently

the intellectual part, (...) will altogether remains idle, (...) in a manner
dead, that scar^ not a spark of Devotion is for in a man.

For these causes therefore (...) said before, that study does very much hurt
Devotion: both because it consumes very much ^ime, and also, because it dries
^p the spirit, both which do hinder this exercise.

There are certain men, who ^re most strongly set upon by this ^emptation, and
that for singular ^onsiderations, which the Devil ^ath in this temptation to
annoy ^an. For the desire of know^dge (as Aristotle says) in all ^en is very
natural; so that the ^iuell had not a sweeter bait to ^snare our first

fortunately, he pro^seth to himself now a good ^ught by the sweetness of the ^e
bait: hoping that it will come to pass, that we being children very like to
our parents, will be taken with the same bait they were, and be deceived, as
they were, albeit we have learned by a manifest example, and by the very
experience of the thing it self, how bitter the end of that way was.

The noblenes of the exercise, and the sweetness which is in it, do^ join
themselves unto this natural desire. For it is apparent that the^ is not any

but that one of the espe^iall means, by which we are lif^ed up to honor is
wisdom. And because this love is bred within ^e innermost bowels of man, he
^together endeavors, ye he may ^mpas that mean, by which ho^r is attained,
that is, ye he may ^tain unto learning and wisdom. ^o these the pretense of
piety, and ^le of the common good is added, which is promoted by this study:
(...) that this good is worthily to be ^sired of all me^; but especially of
^ose ye are more perfect, who are ^nt to desire ye above all things. ^erfore it
happens many times, ye ^der the shadow and color of this ^mon good, a man does
too much cherish his own desire and inclination; saying and persuading
himself, that he does that purely for Gods sake, which he does for his own
natural inclination, or for some base commodity. For many are the ends (as S.
Bernard Bernard in his 36. ser. upon the Cant. Diverse ends of knowledge
says) why a man desires to know. For there be some that would know for this
end only, that they might know, and it is foolish curiosity: there be some that
would know, that they might be known* and it is foolish vanity: and ther^ be
some that would know, the they might sell their knowledge for money, or for
honors, and it (...) filthy lucre. There be also so^ that desire to know, that
the may edify, and it is charity. A^ there be some that would kno^ that they
may be edified, and i^ wisdom. All these ends (...) move the desire, and in
choice (...) these a man is often deceived, when he considers not which ^ught
especially to move: and ^his error is very dangerous.

But that we may return unto ^ur purpose, if there be so many things, which do
allure our heart unto this exercise, who shall be so ^ortified, or who shall be
found (...) constant, that can make resista^ce against so many importunate
sol^citations? If on the one side do ^uite thee a natural desire of ^owledge,
and a natural delight (...) study, the noblenes also of the ^ercise, and
ambition or desire of ^nor, which is got by this study: ^d on the otherside
thine own ^mmoditie, and the profit of the ^urch and common wealth do set
^aire face on it, and do so ouer^d it, that it seems right and re^isit, who
shall be found so strong (...) discreet, that being bound with so manifold a
chain, does not suffer himself easily to be led away? Therefore I said that
this is a great temptation, for it has many hooks and crooks, by which it
lays hold on the hearts of men, and draws them after it. O how often when a
man is at prayer upon his knees, do these images and picture^ present
themselves before him, soliciting him, that spedily he mak^ an end of his
prayer, and that h^ make have to the labor of his dai^ study: that he read

because the miserable estate of our life has brought us unto this straight, we
must look ^ut a convenient time to bestow ^po^ this study: that is, we must

REMEDIES Against this temptation. CHAP. XXXIX.
THe first remedy against this temptation is diligently to consider, how far
virtue exceeds wisdom, and how much divine wisdom surpasses humane
knowledge; that hereby man may see, how agreeable it i^ to reason, that he
should bestow^ more labor and time upon the on^ the^ upon the other. Will thou
the I speak in one word? Hear wh^ the Wiseman says; Oh, how gre^ is he that
finds wisdom? y^ Ecclesia. 25.
there is none above him that feare^ the Lord: The fear of the Lord ^asseth
all things in cleerenes. Hear ^lso that of Augustine: Mankind ^s wont greatly
to esteem the In the proeme of his 4. Book of the Trinity
^nowledge of terrestiall and ce^estiall things, but he is much ^ore better,
that prefers the ^nowldge of himself before this ^cience: and that mind is
worthier ^f greater praise, which knows ^er own infirmity, the^ that which
^ot respecting it, searches to ^owe the course of the stars, (...) he that
already knows ^em, not knowing what way (...) take for the attainement of
his ^fety and salvation.

Let the wisdom of the world ^ue all the excellency it desires: ^tit cannot
escape this one mi^y, that all the profit, which is ^ped by it be not over
thrown ^th the life.

What is more miserable then to seek a thing with so great cost and labor,
which so soon perishes? This is the cause, why a certain Philosopher wept,
a^ Hierome says: for now when he was at deaths door, he was aghast and
utterly abashed, and unwillingly ended his life at tha^ very same time, at
which before he began to apply his mind unto wisdom and knowledge. For if
there be any loss or (...) to be deplored and lamented i^ this world,
certainly it is the death of a Wise man: for then (...) vessel is cast into
the earth fu^ of all kind of admirable secret^ Which seeing it is so, it shall
be (...) point of great wisdom, to fo^low the counsel of our Sauiou^ saying;

your selves upon the earth, where (...) moth and canker corrupt, and when
thieves dig through and steal. But ^y up treasures for your selves in ^auen,
where neither the moth nor ^anker corrupts, and where ^eeues neither dig
through, nor ^eale.

These things being so, it shall ^e much more profitable, to at^nd upon the
works of charity, ^en upon the speculation of the ^derstanding: for the fruit
of ^e endures for ever, but the over is ended with the life.

Furthermore remember that the day of judgment, as a cer^ne holy man says,
thou shall ^t be asked what thou have read: ^t what thou have done: and not ^w
eloquently thou have spoken, ^thow well thou have lived. This ^he consideration,
which being ^ll examined, is sufficient to ^uince their foolishnes, who (...)
too much sweat at the study of humane science. For tell me pray thee, what in
the world (...) more certain unto us, and which does never fail us, then to
(...) well, and circumspectly to wal^ with God? what is more accept^ble unto
him then charity? This that which only pleases him, for which all other
things d^ please him. According to this (...) we shall be examined, and iudg^
and according to the measure this we shall be rewarded. T^ An unlearned man

which seem more wise?

Wherefore, my brother, if tho^ would be sure of thy salvation, walk in this
assured and safe way. I do not say this, that altogether thou should
forsake thy study, but that thou should use it moderately: which in one word

Moreover all law and all nat^ral reason teaches, that we ough^ so to order
our studies and endeavors in learning (as also all oth^ things) that we do not
too mu^ over burden and bind our selue^ and that for this we do not l^ pass
better things. For Chris^stome says, that it is a great damnation of man, to
beautify a^ polish the tongue, and to leave the ^e without order and culture:
for (...) little skilleth how the tongue ^e adorned, but it is of very great
^onsequence that the life be well ^dered.

Therefore what greater mad^s can be thought on, then to be^ow so much labor
upon a thing (...) no worth; and altogether to ^glect a matter of so great
mo^ent.

This is that Saint Bernarde so ^iously admonishes, writing Bernarde in his 2.
Book of consideration.
^to Pope Eugenius; Let thy con^eration, says he, begin of thy ^fe; least

thee, if thou ^ynest the whole world, and losest ^y self? Albeit thou be wise,
^t thou want wisdom* if thou (...) not wise unto thy self? But ^w wise

the deapth of the sea, yet if the know not thy self, thou a^ like unto one

Whatsoeu^ thou buildest without thy self shall be like a heap of dust

This word Against I have ^t used well, I ought to have ^d Besides. Whatsoever
does ^er it self unto consideration, ^ich does not by some mean ^other
pertain unto salvation, ^se and renounce it.

This also ought to move them ^t be studious, that so they give ^selues to
promote the profit of ^ir neighbor, that they do not ^t nor hinder their own
saluati^ and ye they diligently take heed, that whilst they desire to profit
others, they deceive not themselves, albeit the profit of our neighbor, ought
to be less in this respect: for the law of charity does not command us to
benefit others with our apparent hurt and manifest damage. But what and if I
shall prove, that not only the profit of our neighbor is not diminished,
but wonderfully increased, and that it is the only and best way to help our
neighbor, by first helping of our selves.

Believe me, my brother, if in deed thou studiest to profit thy A good life is
the best instruction of our neighbor.
neighbor, there is none other way more convenient to do it, then a good
life, and the exercise of prayer and meditation, by which this good life is
gained unto us. Which doctrine I could approve by many reasons, but by reason
of the smalnes of this volume, it shall be sufficient here to have set down a
few of them.

The first is, that it is manifest to all men, that the true and proper 1
instrument, by which we may help our neighbor, is true wisdom. But to
obtain this, what is more profitable then the fear of God? then an approved
life? then the daily use and experience of virtues? or the prayer and the
continual meditation of the divine law? What is so frequent and common in the
holy Scripture, as that; The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
and: The fulness of Wisdom is the fear of the Lord.

Yea without this mean it is impossible to obtain this virtue: which Saint
Augustine plainly testifies in these words: We Augus. in (...) Sermon.
find many most negligent and careless of righteousness, but most greedy and
desirous of wisdom: the divine Scripture does teach these, that they cannot
attain that they desire, but by keeping and preserving that they neglect. O my
Son, says the divine writ, if thou desire Wisdom, preserve righteousness,
and the Lord will show her unto thee. Wisdom is a grace of God, and a
principal gift of the holy Ghost; therefore it is sooner and more easily got
by tears, then by disputations: by prayers, then by alterations.

Rightly therefore says Augustine; They that have learned Augu of the words of
the Apostle
of the Lord Jesus Christ to be meek, and humble in heart, do profit more by
meditating and praying, then by reading and hearing. But if wisdom be a
principal instrument to help others, why shall not also the means, by which it
is obtained, be of the same kind, of which we have now spoken?

The second reason is: To convert souls unto God, is a work 2
marvelous excellent and supernatural: for by this, their corrupt nature,
that live wickedly, is subdued: and their evil custom, which is little weaker
then nature, and that which is more, the power of the devil, who possesses,
and most strongly holds captive their hearts, are ouercom'd and conquered.
That such powers should be oppressed and overthrown, it is necessary that
greater power and strength should be present, which is not found upon the
earth, but in heaven: which is not so well got by study, labor and speculation,
as by tears, sighings, and the course of a good life.

Hence it is, that they that are converted unto God, are no less the sons of
tears, then of words: so that prayer has no lesser part in the conversion,
then the finest oration of a most eloquent orator.

Wherefore, as the prayer of Moses rather procured the victory against Amalech,
then all the Exodus 17.
swords, that were drawn: so also we must suppose and believe, that in this
victory the prayers, sighs, and groans of a true preacher have no lesser part,
then all the other voices and words, albeit they be ingenious, acute, and
eloquent.

The third reason is, because (as experience witnesses) me^ do 3
offend more grossly and foulely by the corruption of their own affections
and passions, then by the ignorance of the truth. Therefore whosoever applies
himself to bridle and restrain others, and to reform their affections, he
must rather move their will, the^ instruct their understanding: and therefore
all the masters of eloquence do teach, that there is not That thou may move
another, it is necessary that thou be first moved thy self
a more present remedy for this malady, then that first thou be moved unto
that, to which thou desire to move another. This is that which Quintilian
says; The sum and chief of this matter, says he, as far as I can gather,
consists in this, that if we would move others, that we be first moved our
selves. And a little after; The oration ought to be pronounced from such a
mind, which may move. For how can it be, that another should grieve, that
hears, unless I first grieve, that speak? how shall I incense another to anger,
if I my self be not angry? how shall another weep, if he see me speaking with
dry eyes? It cannot be. F^ nothing sets on fire, or makes to burn but
fire: nothing makes another thing moist but water: neither can any man impart
heat to another, if he has it not himself.

Therefore according to that of Quintilian, who doubts but that a Devout man,
who night and day does nothing else, but bewail and meditate in the law of the
Lord, is better, and fitter to teach, then any other although he be wise, who
has never tried, what it is to shed one tear for the love o^ God?

Moreover that eloquence, a^ Cicero says, which breeds no^ 4
admiration, is of no price. An^ if such eloquence be require^ to handle
humane matters, wha^ eloquence think thou will be ^equired to handle divine
mat^ers, to draw men out of their ^nnes, and to repel the forces ^f enemies?
which things as they ^e supernatural, so they require (...) spirit and
eloquence superna^urall. To obtain this kind of ^loquence, it is certain,
that nothing is more profitable then the ^oly Ghost, and so to^ speak, that
the sparkles of this Spyrit ^ay shine in the Sermons we ^reach. For seeing
that this spirit does exceed all the power of nature, there is nothing that
does more allure, suspend and carry unto admiration the hearts of men, ^hen one
of his sparckles: for by it ^he strength and power of the holy Spirit is forth
with known, and so men are humbled, saying with the Magitians of Phara^; This
is Exodus 8.
^he finger of God.

To all these another help is joined much more wonderful, that is, the example
of his life that preaches. For there is no greater argument, that that should
be believed which a man speaks then that he that speaks it do it himself;
and that his life agree with his doctrine. Among all sermons that is most
profitable and effectual, by which the auditour is most edified, and most
profited by.

Wherefore seeing that the sanctity of life is also supernatural and Divine,
the righteous are as the tongues and mansions of the holy Ghost, and all men
naturally do reverence them, and honor them with a worship more then humane,
and do behold and hear them, not as men, but as Angels; not as inhabitants
of the earth, but as Citizens of heaven, and do admire their labors and
works, as remnants and remaynders of the holy Ghost. All these things being
considered of, do sufficiently show, how available it is to the helping and
instructing of others in the way of virtue, if the master and teacher himself
be godly and an embracer of virtue.

Therefore they that from their hearts do seek God, and not themselves, ought
not to respect honor, nor liberty, nor dignity, ^or mastership, nor any
authori^y but only the edifiyng of their ^earers, that at the length they may
come to that pass, that they may say that of the Apostle to Timothy; Take
heed unto thy self, 1. Tim. 4.
and unto learning: continue there^: for in doing this thou shall both ^aue thy
self, and them that hear ^hee.

The first care ought to b^ over thy self, the second over the study and
doctrine, and so it (...) promissed, that thy wisedom^ shall be available to

make large increase for the^ salues before they bear, becom^ much more
fruitful afterward^ unto their owners: so Preache^ the more learned they are,
a^ more religious in themselves, t^ more profitable they are unto others: and
according to the qu^lity of their fruits, such shall be the profit of their
auditors.

^HE NINTH TEMP^ation is an indiscreet zeal, and a desire too vehement, and
earnest to succor and help others. CHAP. XL.
^He indiscreete desire of certain, by which they too fer^tly endeavor to help
their ^ghbor, with hindrance of their ^ne salvation, does not much ^fer from
the precedent temp^ion. This is one of the most ^gerous temptations, which
(...) to us in this life. For (...) other are manifest, and may be ^ne of all
men, what they are. But this does offer it self with so fair an aspect, and
seems so honest, that one would think that none other thing could be wished,
neither that any fraud or collusion was under it. And this temptation is so
much the greater, by how much he is more virtuous, that is tempted: for by how
much he loves virtue, by so much he studieth for the profit of his neighbor,
and for the common good.

For even as nothing is more natural unto God, then to do well unto all his
creatures: so he that participateth more of the spirit and goodness of God, he
is more ready to do good unto others: so that nothing does bear more rule in
the hearts of good men, then an impatient and continual desire to do good to
those that be good, and to succor and relieve them in all things.

For this cause that crafty and ancient seducer of man, in this matter has
always bin troublesome unto the righteous: knowing that nothing is more fit to
deceive them, then that, to which of their own accord they are inclined. And
so we see that many are cast headlong into most difficult and hard matters, and
take such burdens upon them, which do exceed their strength and power, and
that under pretense and color of this help and aid.

Therefore we ought not to take greater heed of any desire, then of this, which
does creep into our souls under color and show of this good, and of this
virtue; for it may procure unto us great strife and trouble. Holy Joshua, seeing
Ios. 3.
the Angel of God in the army, did not credit him before he had asked, Art
thou ours? or our adversaries? So we ought not to give credit to every motion
and thought, although it seems good: for we know that the angel of Satan
can transform himself oftentimes into an Angel of light, which he does more
often and more usually in this work, then in another, because he comes
hither under color of piety, and as though he would inuit us unto charity.
Therefore not without good cause the Fathers in the wilderness said, that
oftentimes the Devil does call a religious man from the exercise of prayer
under pretense of those things that are good, whilst he persuades them that
there is a just and an important cause, why they should do this and that, when
in very deed there is none.

Therefore it is not sufficient here to look into, only the quality and
condition of the work, but also to scanne thoroughly all circumstances, which
according to the rule of wisdom are to be considered of. Amongst other
things, we must especially beware, that we do not so endeavor to profit our
neighbor, that we disprofit our selves, according to that of Ecclesiasticus;
Help thy neighbor according Eccles. 29.
to thy power, and beware that thou thy self fall not. And albeit the remedies
set down in the former Chapter against this evil be sufficient, yet I will
also add unto them the opinion of Saint Bernard, who writes of Bernard in his
first book of consideration.
this matter unto Pope Eugenius, and amongst other things he says: Hear then
what I reprehend, and what I persuade. If thou bestowest all thy life and
wisdom upon action, and nothing upon consideration: in some thing I commend
thee: but in this I do not praise thee. And I think that no man will praise
thee, who has learned that of Ecclesiasticus: He shall get wisdom, that has
vacant Eccles. 38.
time, and is free from action. Certainly neither is he meet for action, who
does not before meditate and consider upon it. If thou would be every body
unto all, like him, that was made all for all: I commend thine humanity: if it
be complete. But how is it complete, thy self being excluded? and thou also
art a man. Therefore that thine humanity may be absolute and complete, let it
receive thy self also into that bosom, into which it receives others.
Otherwise wh^t shall it profit thee according to the word of the Lord, if thou
winnest all men, and losest thy self? wherefore when thou possessest all men,
possess also thy self. Why alone do thou defraude thy self of thy gifts?
whither does thy spirit go, not returning again? why do thou not look unto
thy self by course, as thou do to others? Thou art a debtor both to the
wise and unwise: and only do thou deny thy self unto thy self? The fool
and the wiseman, the servant and the freeman, rich and poor, man and woman,
old and young, clergy and layty, the just and unjust, all and every one do
together participate of thee: all do drink of the common fountain of thy
breast: and will thou stand apart thirsty? If he be accursed that makes his
own part the worst: what shall he be that utterly makes himself without
part. Thy waters are derived into currents through the streets: men and
cattle do drink of them: thou give drink also to the Camels of Abraham's
servant: but among the rest drink thou also of the fountain of thine own
well. Let not a stranger, says he, drink of it. What? art thou a stranger? To
whom art thou not strange, if thou be strange to thy self? To be brief, he
that is rechlesse and barren to himself, to whom is he good? Hitherto be the
words of Bernard, which may suffice to convince that we say; and that by them
we may understand, that the great promoters and procurers of other men's
safeties, ought not to be unmindful of their own: but with great diligence to
regard their own salvation. And also what great wisdom we have need of, to
order this business aright, least we be deceived by an indiscreet fervor of
charity, and by too great a desire of spiritual gain. In which matter we are
to imitate the wise Virgins in the Gospel, who when the foolish Virgins
desi^ed them to impart some of their ^yle unto them, said; we fear Math. 25.
^ast there will not be enough for ^s and you: go ye rather to them that
sell, and buy for your selves. Wherefore if thou have a mind ^o immitate the
wisdom of ^hese Virgins, so look to others, that thou do not neg^ect thy
self: but so bestow thy ^ime, that thou may have time ^or thy self. If thou
shall de^aund of me, how much time ^s requisite for this study? I ^unswere so
much, as is suffi^ient to kindle the fervent af^ection of devotion, which is,
to walk in the spirit, according to the council of Paul: But that Galat. 5.
ye may know what it is to walk in the spirit, and what profit does follow of
it, I will say none other thing, then that a man does then walk in the spirit,
when he comes more and more unto God, and does walk rather toward God, then
toward himself: so that his heat is not now disturbed and misled by the
disposition and affections of nature, which are of himself, but is lifted up
o^ those things, which proceed from that actual devotion, in which he
walks: for this kind of disposition, is not of flesh o^ blood, but of the
virtue of the holy Ghost, and of the continua^ affection of the love and fear
o^ God. Hence it is, that as the hear^ is the beginning of all our works A
Simily.
so according to the quality and affection of our works proceeding of it:
which thing also we see in water flowing from a foun^aine: If the fountain be
muddie and troubled, the water will also be muddie and troubled: but ^f the
fountain be clear and ^right, the water will be so too. So we daily see by
experience, that of a well ordered heart, ordered actions do proceed, and of a
disordered heart, disordered ^ctions, according to that of our Savior: A good
man out of the Luke. 6.
^ood treasure of his heart brings ^orth good, and an evil man out of ^e
evil treasure of his heart brin^eth forth evil.

Seeing therefore that our heart ^s the root and the beginning of ^ll our
good, all our labor ought ^o be bestowed upon it, that so ^ong we may continue
in deep and profound prayer, til our heart be so affected, that it being
gathered unto it self, it may alwaie^ abide in devotion. To the attainment of
which, every prayer i^ not sufficient; but it must be seriously continued: That
as grou^^ well watered in the morning, b^ A Simily.
the coolenes and sweet tempe^ does all that day defend the herb^ planted in
it from the heat o^ the Sun: so let the soul of ye righteous be watered in
due season and by prayer be well moysten^ in God, that it may always hau^ in
it self the continual cool o^ devotion, by which it may be d^ fended from
the love of the worl^ Therefore our devotion ought t^ be like that river, which

the earth: for out of our hea^ which is the place of Gods dai^ ties, ought to
flow a river of d^ uotion so abundant, that it may ^e sufficient to water al
our works.

This is that kind of life, which ^ll the Saints have used: this is ^e top
and crest of a spiritual ^fe: this is the manner of living, which makes men
spiritual and ^iuine: this is that, which orde^eth and disposes all the works
of ^an, in measure, weight, and num^er. To be brief, this is that, which ^aketh
us walk on a sure ground, (...) on every side to be watchful, ye ^e may be
wary in all things, and ^efenced in each respect. There^re let us thoroughly
persuade our ^lues, that it is never acceptable (...) God, if we wholly drown
our ^lues in other men's businesses, ^eit they be of great co^seque^ce, ^d lose
our own time, which we ^ould bestow upon the procuring ^rown salvation and on
ye exercise (...) prayer. For albeit that other men's businesses ought to be
ordered, and to have their hours and appointed times (as we have heard out of
Bernard) yet they do not require that measure of time, which this continual
diligence does, by which is effected, that the spirit is always united to God,
and always carried toward him. To conclude, let us also add this (which in my
judgment Prayer is to be joined unto preaching.
is very pertinent to our purpose) if thou desire nothing more, then to help
thy neighbor and if thou do look into the state, wherein men's affairs now
stand, and do consider of the misery and calamity of the Church join prayer
to thy preaching For the world is not only helpe^ by admonition, but also by
prayer: for by preaching the people are admonished to fly from sinne^ but by
prayer grace is obtaine^ of God, by which the life is amended.

Therefore let this rule be observed, if thou would not err in this
business, if the ministration of the divine word be committed unto thee, beware
that thou no further entangle thy self in worldly and temporal matters, then
thy strength is able to bear, although it carry never so fair a show of
charity. For although the Apostles were full of the holy Ghost, yet they put
from them all such kind of burdens, so that they would not make provision for
the maintenance of the poor. Wherefore in the fourth Council of Carthage In
the 4. Council of Carthage, can. 17. and 18.
it is commanded, that a Bishop by himself should not take upon him the
government and ouerseeing of widows, orphans, and strangers, but that he
should do it by his Archdeacon. In like manner that he should not take upon him
the oversight of wills and testaments, that he might the better attend upon
reading, prayer and preaching. We have also an example of this thing in our
Savior, who when he was requested of one, to command his brother to divide
his inheritance with him, he answered: Man, Luke. 12.
who made me a judge, or a deuider over you? For this cause the Primative
Church did not permit, that any Clergyman or Minister of God should be ordained
a^ ouerseer, or an executour of any man's will. Wherefore when an^ one dyed,
leaving a minister a^ ouerseer of his will, he was deprived of it by all the
suffrages of the Church, as it appears in a certain epistle written by Saint
Cyprian. Cyp. lib. 1. epist. (...). (...)


CERTAIN ADMOnitions to be observed in this exercise against the frauds and
collusions of our ancient enemy. CHAP. XLI.
Hitherto we have spoken of certain common temptations, which are wont to
molest and annoy them that are at prayer; now we will deliver certain
admonitions and instructions, which are to be observed in this course. And
although we have set down certain in the end of the first part of this book;
yet, because they are only put in the end, that they may teach us to pray, I
will set down others here, which may lay open the deceipts and frauds of our
enemy the Devil, who many ways is wont to deceive those, that walk in this
way, turning good medicines into present poisons, and to shipwreck them in the
very haven.

Therefore first of all let us presuppose, that nothing can be There is
nothing so good, but it may be abused by the malice of man.
found in this world so good and profitable, but that by man's malitiousnes it
may be abused unto evil. Wherefore evil men take occasions to persevere in
their wickedness of the very goodness and mercy of God, and of the passion of
Christ. Neither only do they take occasions of these things, but also of
virtue her self, which no man can abuse, following their own affections,
whereby oftentimes they take opportunity to offend. For we see many men that of
fasting, abstine^ce, knowledge, chastity, and such like virtues, do take an
occasion to be proud, and to presume great things of themselves: making that a
matter and an occasion of mischief and evil, which of it self is an
excellent and an honorable good. Wherefore S. Ambrose says: As I very well
understand that chastity is an excellent good, so I fear the thief of pride,
least he steal away that which is good.

Therefore I do not so greatly marvel, if the virtue of Meditation be
sometimes unprofitable to some man, or if it does bring damage unto him, that
knows not how to use it conveniently. But as it is an intolerable madness to
leave the virtue of Chastity, or any other virtue or science, for none other
cause, but because certain abuse it, and by it are proudely puffed up; so also
is it a foolish thing to relinquish meditatio^s for the abuse of some. For
there is nothing under heaven, which we may not abuse.

That we may understand this the better, we must know that there is not any
virtue, which has not by it some vice, carrying Every virtue has some vice
annexed unto it, which has a resemblance of virtue.
a show and a resembla^ce of virtue. For wisdom has vain science bearing a
show of true wisdom: Justice has cruelty; Fortitude rashness; Liberality
prodigality; Humility cowardice; Affability lightness; hope presumption; zeal
unadvisedness; fear distrust; and so in the rest; so that as in all things as
well artificial as natural there are found some true, and some seeming so,
but are not so indeed: for there is both true gold and that which is false;
lawful money, and counterfeit coin; true gemmes, and false gemmes: so also
among virtues, some are true, and some that appear to be so, but are not so in
truth.

This therefore is the greatest difficulty, which is found in the way of
virtue, which is wont to minister matter of error unto young beginners, and to
those that are not well exercised: for many embrace vice for virtue, as we
daily see that men are deceived, receiving counterfeit coin for that which is
true, by reason of the likeness it has with it. This is that which the Apostle
says; That the Angel of Satan does many times transform himself into an
Angel of light: for so does he oftentimes deceive us, obtruding vice unto us.
being colored with a semblance of virtue. But as we said before, that as it is
an evil thing for a man to withdraw himself from the exercise of virtue,
because he is fearful to fall into vice: so also is it dangerous to desist
from the duty of meditation: but the vices and dangers are rather to be feared,
which may arise from this abstaining. For it is manifest, that there is not any
state, nor any manner of living found in the world, which has not some danger
annexed unto it: wherefore all our life may not unfitly be called one danger
and one continual temptation Therefore least any man be blinded or deceived of
himself, it shall be profitable to show as it were with a finger all kind of
dangers, deceipts, and impostures, and to admonish what is to be done in each
of them

THE FIRST ADMOnition of the dignity and fruit of vocal prayer. CHAP. XLII.
LEt this then be the first admonition: they that have mental prayer in
estimation, let them take heed that they do not contemn vocal prayer, or
reject it as unprofitable: because it is Whether vocal prayer differs from
mental prayer.
manifest, that for the very substance of the virtue, there is no difference
between this and that prayer. For to call upon God with the heart only, or
with the heart and the mouth together, does make nothing for the efficacy of
prayer. For to add to the voice of the heart the voice of ye mouth, which God
has created, that he may be praised and glorified by it, how can it be, that
it should derogate any thing from the dignity of the work, or should import
any essential difference? Even as there is no essential difference between
the confessions of him that speaks, and him that writes the same thing; so
also prayer, which is a confession of the divine praises, or (that I may speak
more properly) a certain petition of God for some necessary thing: whether
this petition be made with inward words, or with outward, which are the images
of internal things, there can be found no essential difference between this
and that. This manner of praying is profitable to stir up devotion, and to
inflame the heart, especially when it is lukewarm, and dispersed, and therefore
unfit by his own strength to fly or to swim: for the sweet and devout words,
and the grave sentences, which are found in it, are very effectual to do this,
if they be repeated with humility and attention. For this cause the words of
God are called fire in the Scriptures; Why the words of God are called fire.
for they have virtue to warm our hearts, and to kindle in them the fire of
divine love. Furthermore, voices have (especially when divine Psalms are sung)
a certain natural force to beget devotion, as Saint Augustine testifies, who
hearing the melodious Psalmodye of the Church, says, that he was wonderfully
inflamed within. Besides there are many men of that spirit and complexion, that
they cannot for one moment keep their cogitatio^s fixed upon God: for whom this
manner of praying is most fit, that by it (following the sense and style of
the words) they may attend in heart upon God, and talk with him. For seeing
that they cannot speak unto him with their own words, and open their own
necessities unto him with fit words, it is a very good help for them, if they
be supported with the words of holy men, and that their spirit and devotion be
ruled by them, that by this manner they may more fitly declare their wants unto
God. In this place devout Christians are to be put in mind, that making a
prayer, they do it with as much devotion and affection, as lies in them: for
hereupon depends all the fruit and efficacy of prayer. For in the ears of
God, as Bernard Bernard in certain ^entences.
says, a vehement desire is a great clamor; but a remiss intent, is a
submisse and low voice: for his ears are open rather to the voice of the heart,
then to the voice of ye body.

By this it may be understood how barren and fruitles the prayers of certain
men are, as well ecclesiastical as temporal, who with such have and swiftnes do
run over their prayers, that they seem not at all to talk with God. For
they would not deal so unadvisedly and coldly with men, if in good earnest
they would obtain any thing of them, for as Solomon says, The poor speaks
with prayers; Pro. 18.
but the rich answers roughly. For he that plainly acknowledges his own
want and misery; and desires seriously to be helped in his need; as he
desires it with all his heart, so he prays with all his heart, and with the
Prophet calls with strong crying, saying: I have cried with my whole heart,
Lord hear me. I would to God that men would understand and remember, when they
pray, to whom they speak, and what business they have in hand. For if they
understood that they had speech with that supreme Majesty, in whose presence
the Angels tremble, and that they have to deal with him about weighty and
important business, to wit, about the remission of sins and the salvation of
their souls, their eyes would be opened, and they would see that it is
unseemly, yea that it is unjust that they should so negligently confer with
such a Lord about so great and weighty matters, and to speak to him after that
manner, that they would not speak to a servant, if they would have him to
regard that they say. These S. Bernard does secretly reprehe^d ^ernard in
^ertaine ^ntences.
when he says: This I say briefly, that certain, as I suppose, do sometimes in
their prayer feel a drynes, and a certain dulnes of mind, that praying only
with their lips, they do not mark what they say, nor to whom they speak; the
reason is, because oftentimes they have used so irreverently to come unto
prayer without any care or premeditation. Therefore it behooves us to be
vigilant in all our actions, but especially in our prayers: for albeit that
every hour, and in all places, as Bernard says, the eyes of the Lord do behold
us, yet Bernard in his epistles.
most especially in prayer: for although we are always seen yet then
especially when we speak unto the Lord, and show ourselves face to face. And
in another place: It is a danger, if the In his 4 sermon of Lent.
prayer be too fearful, but greater if it be rash; the third danger is, if it
be luke warm, and not proceeding from a lively affection.

Because a fearful prayer does not pierce heaven; for immoderate fear does
pluck back the mind, that ye prayer cannot ascend, much less pierce. A luke
warm prayer does languish and fail in the ascending, because it wants
vigor. A rash prayer ascends, but it reboundeth back again, for it is
resisted, neither does it obtain grace, but deserves punishment: but that
prayer which is faithful, humble and fervent, without doubt shall pierce
heaven, and shall not return empty. This says he. But those that either will
not pray at all, or that will not pray otherwise then we have said, ye is, with
too much haste, negligently and carelessly, let them not take it in ill part,
that this is said unto them: for by this means their coin is become base, and
the worth of it is diminished and not set by.

THE SECOND ADmonition of the dignity and fruit of holy ceremonies, and of
external works. CHAP. XXXXIII.
THe second precept, which a devout man ought to observe ^s, that as he ought
to have vocal prayer in estimation (as we said before) so also he ought to
have in ^euerence all holy ceremonies, for ^hey are very profitable unto us,
Ceremonies and external reverence are to be made account of.
^eing means to stir up our hearts with a Devotion and reverence of Divine
things. For as our soul so ^ong as it continues in this body ^oth conceive of
things by the windows of the senses, by which they are presented: so it is a
great help, that we may worthily esteem of divine matters, to think
reverently of them, and to use them in that majesty and reverent sort, that
they are to be used in: for the garments, and royal robes, and great retinue,
which the great states of this world use, do move men to such reverence, that
they regard them as kings and princes. For this cause that supreme Majesty,
and glorious Why christ did institute his Sacraments in visible things.
Governor of the world, did institute and ordain the Sacraments of his Church
in visible things, that they might yield an invisible grace. For even as he
instituted them for man, who is a creature mixed of body and soul; that is,
compounded of a part visible, and a part invisible: so also they are
instituted, that they might instruct us, that the sight and presence of that
which is seen, might stir up a devotion and reverence of that, which is not
seen.

Furthermore all holy ceremonies, and external exercises (besides that they
are holy works, and proceeding from virtue) are very conducent to get and
preserve internal virtues. For even as accidents do help much to ye
preservation of the substance (without which it cannot be preserved) so
ceremonies and external works do much help to the preservation of charity and
^nnocency, which is the especial ^reasure of our souls. After the same
manner, because man is a treature consisting of soul and body it is meet that
he serve God with both, bestowing his soul upon his love and knowledge, and
his body, and all his mem^ers and senses upon his worship and service, that all
things which are of God, may also serve God.

By this means man is made a pure and perfect sacrifice, when he is wholly and
altogether, n^ no part of him being excepted bestowed upon the service o^ his
Creator, and then is fulfille^ that commandment of the Apostle, who wills
us to give up our bodies a living sacryfice, holy and acceptable unto God* and
he commands that ou^ bodies, spirits and souls (tha^ is, all that is in
man) be kept in all purity and perfection, for the glory of God.

We are bound to serve God with all that is within us: therefore it is no
reason, that the body with the members and senses should withdraw themselves
from this obedience: ye^ the Apostle himself comaund^th, that as in the time
of our ^lindnes. We gave our members as Romans 6.
^eapons of unrighteousness unto sin: ^o now that we give our members as weapons
of righteousness unto God. Hence it appears, that as Angels In Angels services
merely spriituall are required; in me^ seruic^ mixed.
are pure spirits, so also pure worship and spiritual service is ^equired of
them: but of men, because they are spirits includ^d in bodies, together with
their spiritual works, which are principal, corporal works and services
are also required.

THE THIRD ADMOnition, of the reverence and obedience, which is due to the
preachers and ministers of the Church. CHAP. XLIIII.
LEt the third admonition b^ that although spiritual me^ do familiarly
converse with Go^ and have him their master to expel their ignorance,
accordin^ to that of the Prophet, who sait^ They that are humbled at his feet^

receive his words and doctrine: y^ let them not lightly regard, b^ have in
great reverence the min^sters and preachers of the wo^ of God: for they be
instrumen^ of the holy Ghost, and also riue^ and conduit pipes, by which the
water of wisdom is conveyed unto the garden of the Church, of whom it is
written: The Priests Mal. 2.
^ps shall preserve knowledge; and ^hey shall seek the law at his mouth. ^f
Mos^s, who spoke face to face Exodus 18.
^ith God, did not despise the ^ounsell of Iethro his father in ^aw, who was an
Heathen man, who will be so arrogant, that rely^ng upon that familiarity which
^e has with God, will contemn (...) doctrine of his ministers, and the
dispencers of his mysteries? What greater pride can be thought of? ^r what
greater cause, for which (...) man should be forsaken of God, deceived of the
Devil, and left unto himself? If the Apostle Paul went up to Jerusalem, that

^ther Apostles of the Gospel, which he had learned in the third heaven who
will be so confide^ so to trust his own spirit, as no^ to confer with the
ministers (...) the Church of Christ? The orde^ which the Divine Wisdom
v^seth in the administration of the world, is, to govern inferio^ things by
superior, and to ho^nor his ministers, whom he hat^ ordained to that work,
and he^ wills that we always have r^ course unto them, and that w^ should
receive grace by they^ hands.

It is written, that while Pet^ was speaking, the holy Ghost fell o^ Act. 10.
all them which heard the word. After the same manner the^ sam^ Spirit daily
descends inuisibl^ upon all them, that humbly hear^ the word of God out of
the mouth of his ministers.

Neither must we here look^ whether the Ministers be goo^ men or evil; but
only whether they be the instruments and organes of God. For that gold is A
Simily.
not baser, which is found among coals, then that which is found among precious
stones: neither is the medicine of lesser virtue, which is drunk out of a
vessel of clay, then that which is drunk out of alabaster. Therefore the
servant of God ought not to despise the preacher, albeit he be a wicked man in
his life, so long as he teaches the word aright, for oftentimes God, who is
the master of them that be humble, does bestow by their ministry gifts and
graces upon those that be ^is. For the Church has her ministers, who do teach
^he people, whom besides the knowledge that they have got by their own study,
the holy Ghost does many times illuminate, and does move them to speak those
things, they understand not: which happened unto Caiphas, who was the hye
Priest that year. And surely we do tempt God, when we presume to get that by
prayer only, which we may have by ye ordinary way.

It is true that for the determination of spiritual matters more time is
required: for besides doctrine; charity, and the fear of God are necessary.
For Science does much illuminate, but much more charity, especially in
spiritual matters, which together with the theory do require a practice o^
those things.

Therefore no man perfectly knows the gifts and particular graces of God, and
the sweetness o^ that hidden Manna, unless h^ himself has tasted of it.
Therefore the Psalmist says, The mout^ of the righteous will speak of
wisdom, Psalm. 37.
and his tongue will talk of judgment: for the law of his God is in his
heart. And Ecclesiasticus says: The mind of a godly man Eccles. 37.
does sometimes show more truth, then seven watchmen that sit above in an high
tower. This has place chiefly in spiritual matters, and particular causes.
But for deciding of controversies in matters of faith, for humane contracts,
decrees, Ecclesiastical commandments, and such like things, the doctors of ye
Church, and masters of those faculties do best know: and these spiritual
matters are diligently to be examined, ye it may be seen, whether they agree
with the rule of the divine Scripture. To know other matters, let devout men
(as much as lies in the^) seek for learned men, and those of a good
conscience. For nothing in the world is more dangerous, nor brings more
harm, then knowledge without the fear of God: for where there is doctrine
without this correction, there is pride and elation of spirit: but where there
is pride, there is darkness, ignorance, and divine reprobation. From this
fountain all heresies present and past are bred, with infinite other evils and
enormities of life. Wherefore the Wiseman says: Let them that bring peace be
welcome unto thee, but of a thousand have but one counselor. When thou have
found such an one confer with him of all thy matters, with humility and
confidence: and do not every day s^eke for new masters: for this oftentimes
brings confusion, and it is a property of unconstant men, and of those, that
go about, seeking for fancies and opinions like their own, neither do they
rest, till they have found them; which being found, they say, that they are
ruled by others advice, when indeed they are ruled by their own. By which it
is manifest that it is no small thing to know how to choose good council, and
perhaps of no lesser import and consequence, then to give good council.

THE FOVRTH ADmonition, of the discretion which is required to the examination
of good purposes. CHAP. XLV.
THe fourth admonition not much differing from the former, is; That although
devout prayer is the fountain of good desires: for there by reason of the
consideration of the perfections and blessings of God, the fire of charity
burns, from which the sparks of good desires arise: yet a man must not too
much trust these desires, running headlong after all those things he desires,
not doing that before, which John admonishes, Believe not every spirit, but
try the spirits whether 1. John. 4.
they are of God: for oftentimes vice is covered under virtue; oftentimes the
wolf plays the thief under a sheep skin; and Satan does transform
himself into an Angel of light.

Therefore we must know, that as nature, which has given to man affections and
appetites to the preservation ofhis natural life, has also given him reason,
that he may rule and moderate them (otherwise they would endanger his life) so
the holy Ghost, who stirs up spiritual desires in the righteous, to the
preservation of a spiritual life, does add also discretion, which may rule,
examine and moderate those desires: that being so moderated, they may be
rightly disposed unto action. But because many spiritual me^ do not this,
oftentimes they take matters in hand which have no good success, whereby it is
apparent, that they are deceived; for they supposing their desire was good,
thought all things were now so safe, that they might finish although
blindfolded, that they meditated upon. Wherefore nothing is so necessary, as
that a man should now and then examine his good desires, and his zeal; the
which by how much it has a more beawtifull show of good, by so much it may
more easily deceive under the color of good. For this cause God in the old
testament would have salt used in all the sacrifices, that he might intimate
unto us, that the sacrifices of all our works ought to be seasoned with
discretion. Wherefore the king of Persia, who commanded all things to be given
unto the Israelites 1. Esd. 7.
in weight and measure, which pertained unto the building and furn^shing of the
temp'e; commanded, that salt should be given unto them without measure, for the
great use and need of it: seeing that in all our works we have need of the
salt of discretion. For seeing that it is the eye of our soul, we cannot
conveniently move a foot without it.

THE FIFTH ADMONItion, that together with prayer, a man ought to be exercised in
all other virtues. CHAP. XLVI.
THe lover of devotion is fifthly to be admonished, that although prayer be an
excellent virtue (for by it we obtain the spirit of God, and his grace, which
is the fountain of all our blessings; and with it many virtues do concur, as
we said before) yet for all this a man must not so desist and leave off, but he
must also bestow his strength and might to compass other virtues, as well that
he may satisfy his duty, to which he is bound, as that by little and little he
may get an habit of them. For although the fervor of charity is a great prick
unto devotion: yet notwithstanding this fervor being somewhat slacked, which
oftentimes comes to pass, forth with natural appetites and affections do
arise, and begin to lift up their heads, unless they be bridled by the
continual exercise of virtue, so yt they headlong cast a man into many
infirmities and debilities. Therefore it is necessary, that besides the help
we have of prayer, that we be also aided of the acts and exercises of virtue,
yt by use and continuance in them, by little and little we may get unto us an
habit, and so the affections and perturbations of our mind may be restrained,
that we may have the exercise of virtue not only for the delight of Devotion,
but also that by the customary use of virtue, passions may be subdued.

But if a man in the execution of these works, especially in ye works of mercy
be sometimes distracted and disturbed, and as it were forsaken of the spirit,
let him not for this discourage himself, neither let him think, that he has
lost any thing in this business, or that he shall bring forth greater fruit in
an other exercise: as many think, who know not in what thing true virtue
consists, both because it is not to be marvelled at, if we be troubled being
distracted with many businesses: and also, because that which is sweet, is not
always wholesome, yea many times the contrary happens. For we see that it
does no less profit the sick to eat with A Simily.
loathing and abhorring, then it does the sound to feed with appetite and
stomach: neither is a purging medicine, although bitter, less profitable then
other meat, although it be sweet.

They are much deceived, that do judge of the dignity of works by the taste,
and by the sweetness: and it oftentimes happens that such do not work for that
end, that they ought to work for, that is, that the will of God might be done,
but that their own may be done: not that they might love and seek God, but
that they might seek themselves. Oftentimes I had rather have the distraction
and drynes of the obedient, then the attention of certain devout men: for that
is wont for the most part to be always most secure, which is bitter, and
contrary to our will. Thou ought not here to be afraid; for oftentimes some
defects are wont to happen in this business, as idle ^ords, etc. from which he
thin^eth himself free, that abstaineth ^om these exercises: for as it is A
Simily.
^o marvel, if he be never woun^ed, that never comes into the ^attaile; so
also it is no marvel, (...) he now and then be lightly ^ounded, that fights
in the ^auntgard. Our Lord very well ^oweth all our infirmities, ther^re he
wills that we should be ^xercised in every good work: ^eyther let him
marvel that wal^eth upon the water, if he have ^e soles of his feet wet; or
that ^s hands be a little black, that ^ucheth pitch: that is, if he sa^our of
a little humane frailty, that conuerseth with men for the good of them: for
this is spiritually to become What it is to become accursed for our brethren.
accursed for them.

THE SIXTH ADMON^ tion, that they that pray much, ought not to despise them,
that pray less. CHAP. XLVII.
Sixthly godly men are to be a^ monished, who are frequent i^ the exercise of
prayer, and in it afte^ a singular manner are visited (...) God, and do receive
many co^for^ by it, that they do not judge, n^ contemn those, that are mo^

the same, ^at the mother of Sampson in ^mes past said to her husband, ^at she

that he should ^ye, to whom she said; If ^e Lord would kill us, he Iud. 13.
^oulde not have received a ^urnt offeringe, and a meat of^ering of our
hands, neither ^ould he have showed us all ^hese things, neither have told
us that which is to come. So also these seem to say in their hearts, if we
were not in the favor of God, God would not bestow these comforts upon us.

These must consider, that such comforts, and such motions of the spirit, are
not the virtues themselves, but instruments and helps, by which virtues are
obtained: so that they are unto virtue, that which spurs are unto a rider,
weapons unto him that fights, a book unto a student, and a laxatiue medicine
unto him that desires to be purged. But what do spurs avail him that will
not ride? to what end are weapons, if thou will not fight? what does a book
profit a student, if he wi^ not open it? and what does a^ laxatiue medicine
help or further him, who being purged yet does not recover his wished health?
yea all these things are rather burdenous unto him, whom they further not unto
good: for a streighter and a greater account shall be exacted for them. For if
^o know God only, and not to do good, be a circumsta^ce, which makes the
fault of a negligent man much more grievous, as all scriptures do testify,
what then shall the sweet taste of God do, what shall the consolations of the
^oly Ghost do, which are of power to make Angels of men? If ^e that received

^ade and gain with it, for hiding (...) in the earth, be grievously pu^ished
for it, what shall be done ^o him that has five talents deli^ered him, and
does also hide ^em in the earth? If an husband^an should hyre a company of
^ruants to labor in his vyne^ard, with this condition, that in the morning at
his house they should have their breakefast, and afterward go to their
labor (...) if after they had broken their fast, and taken his larges, they
should not go to his Vineyard, but to the market place there idly to walk
and talk, and vainly to spend the time, would he not be very angrye with
them, if he should find them?

I pray thee what is that spiritual refection, which God gives unto his in
prayer, but a breakfast, with which he would strengthen them, that they might
be^ more cheerful and courageous t^ labor in his Vineyard? If therefore after
this breakfast, I do not labor^ and that upon this opinion, that Go^ ought that
unto me, which I hau^ eaten (when as in the mean season I owe unto him the
labors (...) the Vineyard) how shall not I b^ found a derider and a deluder of
^is Majesty? For if he sin less, ^at acknowledges his theft, and ^r this
more humbles himse^e; ^e^ he that besides his theft, does ^so suppose himself
to be better ^en others, when he is a greater ^eefe, he sins a great deal
^ore, and becomes vntollera^le. Hence also springs an other ^ill, that
they, who are come to ^is point, grow incorrigible, and ^e despise other men's
aduices ^d counsels. For no man dares ^rrect them, because outwardly ^ey
pretend so great sanctimo^, neither will they suffer any one (...) correct the^;
for they think that ^ey go before every one in virtue ^thinketh not as they
do: Where it manifestly appears, how ^al reason me^ use in estimating ^e
dignity of things, while they ^ake boast of that, of which they should take
greater cause to fear.

That this may be understood the better, we must note, that From whence the
consolations of the Spirit arise.
these spiritual joys and consolations are derived from three causes. For
sometimes they proceed from the holy Ghost, as we have said before, who by
this means would weane men from the world, and give them strength to overcome
the difficulties of virtue. Sometimes they arise from the noblenes of the
studies, and matters, which we handle and think upon: such were the delights
of the Philosophers, when they meditated upon the variety, might, and art of
things created, and from hence ascended to the contemplation of God, and o^
separated substances, in which (as Aristotle says) are found exceeding
delights, and that by reason of the dignity and noblenes of such things. And so
there are many, that meditating upon the works of God, as well of grace, as of
nature: or reading the holy Scriptures, and the books of the Doctors of the
Church, do take great delight and pleasure in them. For, as the things that
they read and meditate upon, are most high and noble, so also are they most
pleasant and sweet, and very powerful to ^eget delight. But if there be ^one
other thing that delights (as oftentimes it comes to ^asse) all that is
mere natural, neither is it any sign of any sanc^ified celestial grace. In
like ^anner there are some (as a cer^aine Doctor says) who of their ^wne
nature have a certain ^weete and delightful affection (...) the chiefest
good, which is God. But let such, says he, taken heed unto themselves, that
they be not deceived, thinking tha^ they have so much charity, as they have
delight: for every one hat^ so much of this virtue, as he laboreth, and as he
denies himself for the love of God. For chariti^ (as says S. Gregory) is not
idle Charity is not idle.
but works great matters, if i^ be true: but if it work not, it i^ not true
charity.

These consolations may also b^ many times sent of the devil, tha^ by the^ he
may deceive and mak^ me^ proud: whilst they perswad^ themselves, that they are
some body: or that he may detain them i^ some error, or sin: as he dealet^ with
heritickes, whom he causet^ to take great delight in reading (...) Scriptures,
that by this mean^ he may more surely bind them i^ their error. He deals
after t^ same manner with sundry Christians, that he may make them (as I said
before) more lofty and stately, and less subject to the counsels of others,
that so they may altogether be made incorrigible.

These things being thus, we may easily gather, that from what fountain
soever consolations do flow, that a man has no reason ^o be proud of the^, or
too much ^o glory in them.

For if they be of the holy Ghost, ^here is no cause why a man should extol
and lift up himself: ^ut that he should rather fear, ^onsidering of the
account, which ^sto be rendered for the^, as we said before. If they do arise
only from ^aturall things, and be merely ^aturall (as those were of the
^hilosophers) we have grea^er cause of fear and grief, ^en of joy and
delight, considering the deceiueablenesse, corruption, and vanity of our
nature. But if they spring from tha^ wicked and malignant spirit, man has
far greater cause of dread^ as he has who hangs betwen^ the horns of a
bull. For ho^ shall not that bird fear, which A Simily.
stands in a place, when she see^ the bait of the fowler laid, b^ sees not
where the snare is s^ for her? So that in the one the^ is no cause to be
proud, and (...) the other there is great reason to fear.

Yet let it be, that all the^ consolations are of God: yet (...) must consider
that these fau^ and graces are not given unto (...) that we should be puffed
up, a^ despise our neighbor, but (...) the^, that we should more se^uently
love God, and that w^ should be humbled before other

For otherwise we receive the gifts of God not to our profit, but to
judgment and condemnation; if we contemn our neigh bour.

Furthermore we must consider All men are one body.
that the church of Christ is a most perfect body, in which there are diverse
members, every one in differing in figure and office: yet all necessary for the
ministry and ornament of the body. For it is necessary, that in the mistical
body of the Church there be variety of members: that is, of diverse ^tates and
offices, that there may ^e no defect in the office and mi^istery, but that the
Church may ^e altogether beautiful. For the ^oate of Joseph was also party
co^ured; yt the variety of ministers ^spiritsmight be signified which ^e in the
church; all which make ^ast unto a happy life, but every one by his several
way. For even A Simily.
as from the circumfere^ce of a circle there are many lines tending to the
center: so there are many ways by which Christ leads his to heaven, which is
the common center of every ones selicitie.

Wherefore Christ leads some to this center by the way of prayer and
meditation: others by the way of preaching: others by the way of patience in
adversity; others by abstinence; many by poverty, some by humility: some by the
works of mercy: and others by other ways, al which lead and direct to one and
the self same place.

Which seeing it is so, why do thou persuade thy self that thy way is better
and safer the^ ye way of others? who has given thee this security? If it be
God alone yt weighs spirits, and searches hearts, who has put the balla^ce
into thy hands, to weigh the^, as thouthinkest good, and to make thine end
heuier when thou please? or who has placed thee in this chair, to give such
judgment? That man is not so fervent in prayer, as thou art; yet
nevertheless, it may be (although no man has made thee his judge) that he is
more patient, more humble, and more obedient then thou art; and that he has
more charity, and more mercy, then thou have: and so he may excel thee in
other virtues, which are more laudable.

He does not weep so often, as thou weepest: neither does he feel, that thou
feel. And do thou know whence these tears spring, and whence this
feeling is? for although commonly we say that they are of God, yet it may be,
that they are of an other spyritte: it may be that they are rather of nature,
then of grace: that is, they may rather flow from the tenderness, and soft
constitution of the heart, then from the spirit of God. Furthermore although
they proceed from this spirit, yet the height of perfection consists not in
them; but they are only instruments of perfection: the victory of the battle
is not placed in these,, but they are weapons to obtain it: our salvation
lies not in them, but they are means unto salvation.

For the good of man consists not in the instruments, and in preparations
destined unto it, but in their good use. It were ridiculous, if any one should
say, that he that has eaten more then others, will also dig and delue more
then others: for it may be, that be that has eaten less, may labor more;
seeing that the one does not of necessity follow the other. After the same
manner Prayer and that comfort that God sends, are destined and ordered to
compass the love of God; yet there be many, that use not this favor well, and
that abuse the water given them to refresh the plants of virtue, to the
cherishing and fostring of their own delights: that is, that turn and convert
the comforts and graces, which they have received, by which they should further
grow in love with God, to their own recreation and love of themselves.

We ought to judge no man, much less Ecclesiastical persons, who live in the
profession of virtues. For the contempt of the^ does engender in the soul a
worm so hurtful and dangerous, that it does not only gnaw their persons, but
also their office and ministry, which is ye sou^taine and spring of many
euilles. Neither must we publish, or boast of in the market place the faults
and offenses of our brethren, yea albeit we see the^, being mindful of that
curse of Noah, which he inflicted upon his son, because he would not cover
the nakedness of his father: but rather let us follow the reverence of the other
two brethren, who discreetly, and with honor covered it. That great Emperor
Constantine had this spirit, amongst whose praises, An excellent saying of
Constantine
this especially is numbered, that he said: If I should take a Preacher or a
minister of Gods word in any crime, I would cover him with my cloak, that he
might be seen of none. This is properly called zeal, and the spirit of
Christ: but to triumph, geere, scoff, and disdain, when any of the servants
of God falls, this is proper unto Antichrist, whom all follow, that are his
members.

Neither for ones fault, or for the fault of a few, are all straightwayes to
be condemned: for this was palpable and gross ignorance; as if for two or
three women, which seemed A Simily.
good, and afterward were taken in adulterye, one should say that all married
women are adulteresses.

They that live without the flesh, are always either good, or evil: they
always stand, or fall: but they that abide yet in the flesh, sometimes fall,
and after rise again. Ifin heaven, in Paradise, in the school of Christ, and
in the college of the seven Deacons of the church elected of ye Apostles there
was one that fell, and became disobedient, who sold his Master, and failed in
the faith: is it any marvel, if a like thing be sound in other states and
congregations? The fault of them that fall from so high places, does not
diminish, but increase their dignity, that persevere and continue in them.

THE SEVENTH ADmonition, that all kind of singularity is to be avoided. CHAP.
XLVIII.
THe seventh admonition is, that a Devout man so live, that as much as lies in
him he make no vain show of his devotion, and that he studiously endeavor
himself, that he may eschew all kind of singularity, as well in his apparel,
as in his other actions without offense to God; according to the counsel of
Seneca writing unto his friend; Look, says he, that thy exterior figure be
common with other men: but that thine interior habit may differ from them.

To this admonition it appertains, A secret place to pray in is to be chosen.
Math. 6.
that the place of prayer be such an one, as our Savior shows, when he
says; But when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber: and when thou have shut
thy door, pray unto thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which sees
in secret, shall reward thee openly. This I say, ^beit there be many that very
appily do pray in the church, and ^e much helped by the receiving ^f the holy
sacrament of the Lords ^pper (which without doubt ^ingeth great help to the^ yt
pray) yet there are some, for whom a secret place is more fit to pray in the^
a public place: by reason of the danger of vain glory, and singularity. A
secret place removed from the eyes of the world is a safe haue^ for young men
and young maids. Let devout me^ make oratories of corners, and let them there
worship God in spitit and truth. For seeing that Jonas prayed in the belly of
the Whale, certainly there is not any place, which is inconvenient to pray to
God in. In this opinion was the Prophet, when he said: My soul thirsts for
thee, my flesh greatly longs for Psalm. 63.

Sanctuary, when I behold thy power and the glory.

The vices which accordin^ The vices of women.
to Solomon, and the Apostle Pa^ are especially to be reprehended in women, are
these; curiosity, idleness, prattling, unquietness or instability; which is, that
they cannot long stay in one place. Which vices because they do not correct,
they tra^sgresse the law of God, and do forsake the study of devotion. This
one reason is sufficient, that they, that truly desire the glory of God, do
diligently look to themselves, that they do not give occasion to any one to
slander ^ertue, seeing yt the Apostle does so often admonish, we yt do nothing
^y which the doctrine of Christ ^aybe blasphemedin any respect. (...) would not
have any one here to ^ake any occasion to defend wo^en, that come not to
church, to ^ray, to hear service and Sermons, and to receive the holy
Communion ^n those days, that are appoin^ed: for it is one thing to take away
the necessity, and an other thing to pare away the superfluity. For this has
the Church thought good, this the Saints have taught, and amongst them Saint
Hierome who in his Epistles does often commend the Solitarines of women.

For this cause these persons ought always to use great discretion When and
how often we are to communicate
in frequenting the holy communion. For albeit the Christians in the primitive
Church did daily communicate: yet this example is not now forth with to be
followed, because then it was no note of singularity, to do that, which all
did: as it is no note of singularity to be clothed with a white garment in
that place, where all are arrayed in the same color. This Sacrament is to be
received at such times, as the Church has appointed: let some come every
month, others every week, as Augustine counsaileth, some seldom, some
oftener, according to occasions, or the desire of him that would communicate, or
according to the age, devotion and state of every one.

This admonition especially belongs unto women, of a suspected age for
vainglory and singularity, although neither for these, nor for any other so
general a rule can be given, which does admit no exception.

THE EIGHT ADMOnition is, that too much familiarity as well of men, as of
women, is to be eschewed. CHAP. XLIX.
THe eight admonition is, that with all endeavor we fly from the too much
familiarity as well of men, as of women: yea, although they be religious and
spiritual: for it often comes to pass, as one says, that spiritual love is
changed into carnal love, for the similitude and likeness of the one with the
other.

This is very often, and very seriously beat upon by the holy Fathers. S.
Augustine says: I dare boldly say, that he that will not Aug de cohabitatione
clericorum and mulierum, sets de singulari. clericorum.
eschew familiarity to converse with women, shall without doubt at the length
fall. And in another place; Chastity is consorted with a grievous companyon,
whom we must not only resist, but letting the bridle go, fly from as far as we
can. Neither are women less to be eschewed, because they seem religious:
because by how much they are more religious, by so much the more they do sooner
allure, and under the pre^ence of piety lurketh the lime of ^ust: credit me
assuredly, I speak ^y experience, before God I lie ^ot: I remember that the
cedars of Lybanus, that the captains and guides of the flocks have ^allen by
this plague; whose ^all I did no more think of, ^hen of the rebuke of Ambrose
or Hierome. And a little after: what great Bishops, and what excellent Clerks,
after many fiery trials, and victorious combats, after many wonderful things
done by them, are known to have ship wracked with them all, when they would
sail in a slender bark? What mighty and strong Lions has this one delicate
infirmity (that is, luxury) tamed: which being vilde, base, and wretched, yet
makes pray of great things.

Saint Hierome does agree unto this: Says he, either be indifferently Hierome
in an Epist. to Nepot.
ignorant of all the may des and virgins of Christ, or else indifferently and
equally love them: neither have affiance and confidence in thy fore passed
chastity; for thou can not be more holy then David, nor more wise then
Solomon. Always remember, that a woman cast the tiller of Paradise out of his
possession.

And S. Isido^e says: If thou stand near a serpent, thou shall not be long
safe: and if near a fire, thou shall wax warm, albeit thou be iron. But
Saint Bernard does more vehemently Bernard upon the Canticles.
tax them, that do continually converse with women. To be always with a
woman, says he, and not to know a woman, is it not more, then to raise ^he
dead? that which is less thou can not do, and shall I believe ^hee in that
which is greater? Bernard says this, either that he ^ight terrify us, or that
it is so in ^he truth of the matter. Be as it ^ill, that is at the least
greatly to ^e feared, which so great a man (...) seriously urges.

For these reasons, and coun^iles of the Saints, the servant of God, who
caryeth so great a treasure in an earthen vessel, ought to walk advisedly and
circumspectly, mortifying himself in all his members, fearing in the midst of
security: for this fear brings greater security. That here is to be noted,
which Saint Hierome says; that we must not rely upon our forepassed
chastity: for there is nothing so near unto danger, a^ too much confidence.

Neither only must we fly to^ much familiarity: but also a^ occasions, that
dispose unto it for he that would take away the end, must also take away the
means, which dispose to tha^ end. For oftentimes there lurket^ a serpent in
the grass, and tha^ friendship, which begun in the spirit, many times ends
in the flesh: and the gold in continuance of time is turned into dross. And
albeit the thing it self has a show and color of that which is good, yet it
is needful that man always think, that his adversary sleeps not: and that
then poison is the nearest, when ^e intermingleth most honny.

THE NINTH ADMOnition, that every one before all things ought to walk in his
calling, that he may satisfy the obligation of that estate in which he is
bound. CHAP. L.
THe ninth admonition is, that a devout man have for a prin^pall foundation of
his life, that before all things he satisfy those things, to which he is bound
by the reason and condition of h^ estate: which being done, let him bestow, as
pleases him, all the other time upon the divine worship. For we must know,
that prayer, speaking properly, is none other thing, then a petition, by which
we desire grace of God, that we may walk in his commandments, and fulfill
his will as knowing our own infirmiti^ and insufficiency to walk s^ without
his especial grace. The Prophet signifies this, when h^ says, I opened my
mouth and pa^ ted, because I loved thy commau^ Psalm. 119.
dements: as if he should say, Because I have desired to keep the
commandments, and cann^ do it without the help of t^ grace and spirit, which
thou giu^ to them that humbly ask it (...) thee, for this I open my mouth in
^rayer, and desire of thee, that ^hou would give me the grace ^f thy spirit,
that being supported ^y his help, I may keep thy ^ommaundements, which I have
^nely and earnestly desired.

Which seeing it is so, it is ma^ifest that the keeping of the di^ine
commandments ought to ^e the beginning of our cogita^ons: and all our prayer,
and ^hatsoeuer depends of it, is to ^e directed to that end. Under ^is first
bond is contained, what^euer pertayneth to the estate ^d condition of every
one: as ^ose things are which belong ^to the ministry, to man and ^ife, to a
Bishop, to a Judge, to a ^aister, to a clyent, and to be ^iefe, to every man in
his several ^lling and place. For even as ^ese estates are instituted of God,
so also their laws, statutes, an^ ordinances are ordained of hi^ Therefore he
that does violate the laws, does resist the divine ord^ nance. Therefore that
vessel (...) election, and that sanctified man sion of the holy Ghost, does s^
often at the end almost of all h^ epistles, admonish every one what his estate

t^ father to his son: in like man^ what the husband owes to (...) wife, and
what the wife to h^ husband: what the servant owe^ to his master, and what ^he
mais^ to his servant. Go to then, if the laws and ordinauces be of Go^ Prayer

what greater confusion can the be, then so to attend upon pray (by which we
crave aid to kee^ the law of God) that in yt mea^ time we neglect the keeping
^e law? What other thing is this, ^en to leave the end for the ^eanes
destinated to it? to for^ke the haven for sailing? and to ^st away health for
the medi^ne, by which we obtain health? what other thing is this, then ^at a
man in prayer seeks more ^r himself, then he does for God? ^d had rather
satisfy himself, ^en satisfy God? for he leaves ^od for the love of
himself: ^at is, he leaves that which God ^mmandeth, that he may do ^at,
which pleases himself.

To be brief, this is none other ^ng, then not to understand at what prayer
is: neither for ^at it is ordained, when for it ^t is relinquished, which was
^e sought. For if all the force (...) efficacy of prayer consists ^ein, that
we compass unto spirit and courage to keep the commandments of God: wha^
ignorance then is it, to forsak^ the observance of the divine la^ and to run

first to be heated, and to be mad^ soft, before he labor to make stamp in it:
so prayer is to be (...) sed to the softening of the hear^ that thereby it may
be made re^ die for the keeping of the diuin^ law. This then is the first an^
chiefest end. to the which tr^ and perfect prayer is to be d^ rected. To
declare and manife^ this, we have most evident a^ apparent examples and
argume^^ in the Scriptures: but I have fou^ none more excellent or more (...)
for this purpose, then that Psal^ whose beginning is; Blessed (...) those that
are upright in their w^ and walk in the law of the Lord Psalm. 119.
Which Psalm is so great, the the Church has divided it into two and twenty
parts; for there are in it a hundred seventy and six verses; among which
scarcely there is one, in which mention is not made of the law, or of the
commandments, or of the testimonies, or of the ways of God, or of his words:
all which signify ^he same thing. Sometimes vn^erstanding is desired to
compre^end the meaning of the law of ^he Lord: sometimes grace is im^lored, to
the keeping of it: some^mes great fruits and commo^ties are reckned up, which
come ^to them that observe it, and a^aine great plagues and punish^e^ts are
denounced against them ^at violate it: sometimes also the ^ophet declares, how
all his ^easure, all his love, all his de^ght, and all his cogitations were
^stowed upon it.

The whole Psalm then, and all the words and meditations of it, are directed
to this end, that thereby the servant of God may understand, that he ought to
have none other aim in this world, none other inheritance, none other glory,
nor treasure, then the keeping of the divine law: and to this end the whole
station and course of our life, all our considerations, and so all the
exercises of our prayers are to be directed. If this then ought to be our
intent, is there any thing more contrary unto it, then for prayer to forsake ye
very end of prayer? Saint Bernard di^ Prayer is to be set after pub, like good.
not so, who many times willingl^ and of set purpose did leave o^ not only
prayers, but also mo^ deep and profound contemplations, that he might execute
h^ function of preaching and te^ ching (for it was his vocation) (...) he
testifies in a certain sermon in these words: If I have found at Bern. in his
51. ser. upon the Cant.
any time that any of you have profited by mine admonitions, then I confess
that it does not any ways grieve me, that I preferred the care and cure of
preaching before mine own ease and quiet. I am with patience pulled from the
embraces of unfruitful Rachel, that by Leah there might abound unto me
fruits of your proceedings and profiting. Surely it shall not ^rke me at all
of mine intermit^ed quiet, and employment in ^reaching, if I shall see my seed
^ructifie in you, and that by it the fruits of your righteousness are
^ncreased. For Charity, which ^eeketh not those things that are ^er own, has
long ago very ea^ly persuaded me, to prefer none ^f mine own desires before
your profits. To pray, to read, to write, to meditate: and if there be any
other gains of spiritual study, all these have I accounted as hindera^ces
for your sakes. This says he. And in another sermon; Do not think, my
brother, that In his 46. sermon upon the Cant.
by this, any prejudice is done to the love of thy quiet, to the acts of holy
obedience, or to the traditions of thy elders. Otherwise the Bridegroom will
not sleep with thee in one bed, especially in that, which for the flowers of
obedience thou bestrawest with hemlock and brambles. For which he will not hear
thy prayers; neither will he come when thou call him. For such a great lover
of obedience, that had rather dye, then not obey, will not give any part of
himself to him that is disobedient. Neither will he allow of the vain leisure
of thy contemplation, etc. Furthermore, as we are to direct our prayers
according The fruit of prayer is the keeping of the law.
to this aim and leuel, so also we must examine the fruit of our prayers. For
without controversy, the fruit of prayer is the observance of the divine law:
which ye Prophet signifies plainly, who when he had said, that the ^ighteous
man meditated day and ^ight in the law of the Lord, presently Psalm. 1.
he adds, And he shall be ^ike a tree planted by the rivers of waters, that
will bring forth her fruit ^n due season: which fruit of a cer^aintie is none
other, then the keeping of the divine commandments: so that from the
conti^uall meditation of the law, does ^pring the keeping of the law. ^herfore,
my brother, whose duty (...) is to meditate upon this holy ^aw, if at any time
occasion be of^ered thee, to do that which the law commands, be ready to
perform it: and hereby thou shall know, whether thou have meditated on the law
of the Lord with fruit. Let the Judge do his duty, and the Prince his: let the
Bishop, the Minister, the husband, the wife, the servant, the master, the
son, the father, do their duties also: and let every one faithfully execute
that, which is committed unto him, and belonget^ unto his place and calling.
And i^ he sees that it goes not we^ with him, and that he goes no^ the right
way, let him think tha^ he abuses this exercise, and tha^ this medicine will
not be profitable unto him, because it attai^ neth not the end, for which it
wa^ ordained. For if the end was by (...) to get a cheerful spirit, and a
fres^ fervor to walk in the comma^ dements of the Lord: how sha^ he be said
to have obtained this spirit, or this devotion, who so unwillingly, and so
lazily goes about the keeping of the law? for devotion is none other thing,
then a promptnes and readiness of mind, to do all those things, that God has
commanded.

The greater part of the world at this day is plunged in this error: For we
see very many, who, that they may not undergo the ^east cross or trouble, do
altogether neglect that which belongs unto their duty, to the scandale of many,
and to the wronging of themselves. Let us grant that they do not belong unto
the number of these, who are truly devout, and have so endeavored themselves
for the love of God only; yet they are to be ^eferred to this number, who have
taken this exercise upon them for delight, or for honor, or recreation, or for
to get greater authority, or for any such end. These are they, for whom
virtue hears evil, and the exercise of prayer is defamed: whilst men do
judge not by the nature of the thing, but by the persons; neither do respect
the use, but the abuse.

The Apostle very well understood this, and wills to prevent it, writing
unto Titus, and commanding him, that he should be instant in season, and out of
season, that he should admonish every one to do their duties. And when as now
he was come unto married women, he says: Exhort the young women to be sober
minded, that they love their Tit. 2.
husbands, that they love their children, that they be discreet, chaste,
keeping at home, good and subject unto their husbands, that the word of God be
not evil spoken of. Thou see in this Chapter, how plainly the Apostle does
warn every one of his duty, propounding unto the^ not only what they should
do, that is, to have a care of their house etc. but also from what they should
abstain, that is, that the word of God be not evil spoken of, and that their
neighbor should not be scandalized, etc. which is done, as often as any one
offends in those things, which belong unto his duty.

But because this matter is very ^ecessary, for more evidence of it will also
join the doctrine of ^e sequent admonition, wherein will more copiously speak
of ^e end, which is to be looked unto in this holy exercise: and of the
errors that are committed in it.

THE TENTH ADMOnition is, of the end which is to be looked to in this exercise.

THe tenth admonition is conversant about the end, which is to be observed in

Therefore we must here not^ that the chiefest part of a Ch^stian Mortification
of affections is the chiefest duty of a Christian.
life is the mortification (...) ouraffections, and the subduing of our own
wills. For the end of this life is love and charity, and of this love is bred a
general obedience of all the divine commandments, and a perfect conformity
of our wills with the divine will; which Christ testifyeth plainly in the
Gospel, saying: If any man love me, he will keep John. 14.
my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and will
dwell with him. And a little before; He that has my commandments, and keeps
them, is he that loves me. Hence it is, that perfect love and perfect
obedience seem to be one and the self same thing: for he that loves, cannot
but do that, which he commands, whom he loves; but he that hates,
con^emneth the precepts of him, whom he hates.

Therefore to this kind of obedience, mortification, and the denial of our
own will before all things is required. For even as a A Simily.
young set or slip cannot be grafted into a tree, unless first that branch be
cut off, into whose place it is to be inserted: so the divine will cannot be
grafted into our heart, unless first our own will be lopped away; for these
two wills are contrary one to the other. This is the function of mortification,

and the use of moral virtues, which are especially conversant about this. For
the greater part of them consists in this, that they may restrain some one
of these passions, that they may make way for the actions of virtue, in which
the observance of the divine law consists. By all which it follows, that
the end of this whole business is love, obedience, and the mortification of al
our evil affections: as in very few words Ecclesiasticus teaches, saying; The
children of wisdom are the Church of the righteous, and their Eccesi. 3.
offspring is obedience and love. By which words he signifies, that the
chief fruits of righteousness are two: for the first begotten child is the
love of God, of which is bred obedience unto his will: the which that we may
satisfy, it is needful that our own be denied, which is the proper duty
and function of mortification. For which cause all the Saints have made an
especial account of mortification: for it is the first gate and entrance unto
all other virtues.

This is that cross, which our Savior so greatly commends in the Gospel,
upon which all our inordinate affections are to be crucified, as al they have
done, and do, of whom the Apostle speaks; They that are Christ's, Gal. 5.
have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts.

Seeing therefore that this cross is of so great weight and moment, and so
abhorred and hated of our flesh: and seeing that those things which are so hard
and difficult, cannot be performed without great strength and fortitude: and
seeing that unsavory relishes cannot be got down without some sauery sauce,
therefore prayer is ordained, in which both things are found. For by prayer we
obtain What we obtain by prayer.
fortitude and courage to fight against Amalech our enemy: and by prayer the
divine grace is bestowed upon us, which alone can do al things: in it charity
is kindled and exercised, which is the mother of all virtues, and by this our
eyes are daily more and more opened unto the divine knowledge: to be brief in
it the joy of the holy Ghost is communicated unto us, by which the way of the
Lord is made most pleasant and sweet unto us: according to that of the Prophet;
I will run the way of thy commandments Psalm. 119.
when thou shall enlarge mine heart.

For this cause prayer is so exceedingly commended of all the Saints: not only
for that, which it is in it self (although it be an especial act of
Religion) but also, and that chiefly, for the great help and aid it brings
to them that endeavor to the foresaid end.

So that it is not so praised and Prayer is not the end but a mea^ to obtain
the end.
celebrated, because it is the end, but because it is an especial means unto
the end: not that it is health, but because it is a medicine procuring health.

If any man therefore should be frequent in prayer, and yet dissolute and lose
in manners, neither endeavor himself unto virtuous actions, he should not
much differ from one that is sick and unsound, who always uses medicines,
and yet is never the better, but still continues in the same infirmity: he is
wretched and miserable after a double manner; first by reason of the grief and
vexation of the infirmity, and secondly because of the continual horror and
annoyance of the medicines.

This is a principle and an axiom general and true: by which any one may
easily understand the sundry errors, which are wont to be committed in this
respect. For ^or the ^eetnes of ^aier some ^e reject ^e bitter^s of
mor^fication.
there are some, who when they find sweetness in prayer, and difficulty in
mortificatio^, they leave that which is difficult, and embrace that which is
easy: they reject that which is bitter, and take that which is sweet, and
they so give themselves wholly to prayer, that they make small account of
mortification.

For man's heart is greedy and desirous of any pleasure, so that some
Philosophers did not blush to affirm; That pleasure was the The Epicures.
last end, and center of humane felicity: But all other affirmed, that it is
the bait of al evils, for by the desire of pleasure very many do cast
themselves headlong into all vices and enormities. What? is man's appetite so
powerful, that as water A Simily.
of his own natural motion does always slide and drop downwards, and if any
one desires to hinder that passage, he profitteth nothing for it will seek
for some corner or chinke, which it may break through: so also our heart is
always ready bent to all kind of pleasure, so that if silence be imposed
upon it, and any one thing be denied unto it; forth with it swells and
rages, now winding it self this way, now ye way, seeking for a vent, and never
rests, until it has satisfied the lust. Therefore it is very well said of a
certain Nature is subtle.
Doctor, that nature is subtle, and in all things seeks her self: yea in
those men, that are more perfect and Divine.

And rightly he calls her subtle, because with great modesty, so that she
is not perceived, she enters where she lists: and insinuates her self,
whether she is not called; that she may search, if she may find ought, that
may be either pleasant or profitable unto her, which she may enjoy, or which
she may rest in.

Hence the greater part of errors arise, which are wont to meet with us in
this way. Hence first arises the corruption of the intent of the good works we
do: the only and principal end of which is God: our sensual appetite does
contrary and gainsay this end, which always seeks something, wherein to
delight it self. And this is a principal and a chief thing, that does
corrupt al our works, and causes, that the Water is not altogether pure.

Hence it is that many live in error, thinking that they have done many good
works, in the ministry of the Lord: which when they come to be examined at
the strict judgment of God, it presently and plainly appears, ye it was not
pure gold, ye they brought, but mingled with dross, and full of the mud of
their own love.

From this fountain it also spingeth, that many in the exercises of prayer, of
reading, and meditation, etc. do hunt after nothing else, but delight, and a
certain spiritual joy, and in this they place the height of their desire:
persuading themselves, because it is a spiritual delight, that they are now in
a safe haven, and that there cannot remain any danger, but in a carnal
delight, they do not mark, that self love, that spiritual gluttony,
coueteousnes, and such like affections, may also have place here, as a
certain Doctor says: and perhaps so much the more, as these delights are
greater, and more desired.

At the least this is certain, that the root of all this evil is the love of
our selves, which has an eye always immovably fastened upon private commodity
and self gain: whether it be in this matter, or in that: that is, whether the
commodity be of delight, or ^e hoped for by a false surmise, unless the
difference be heere^n, that the fault is greater, and the error lesser, when
the delight ^s filthy and dishonest; and the fault is lesser and the error
greater, when the fault is not in the desire, ^ut in the opinion: that is, when
^s a man does expect more, or ^ath that thing in greater price, which he
desires, then the nature of the thing is in it self.

But if thou shall say unto me, that there are not many, who are ^hus deceived:
for that no man is ^o blind, that wholly intends and seeks for delight in
the ex^rcise of his prayers and studies.

I answer, that they are too many, who are thus deceived: for we see by
experience, that many are so tied to this study and exercise, that if at any
time a work of charity, or of corporal trouble be offered unto them,
presently they shrink back, and rather impose it upon any other, then they
will undergo it themselves. And this is a manifest sign, that such do not
purely and simply seek for the good pleasure and will of God. For when that
offers it self, which they know to be pleasing unto God, they turn
themselves from it, and turn unto that which is pleasing and pleasant unto
themselves: none otherwise, then if nothing was acceptable unto God, but that
which was also grateful unto men: when as in a manner the contrary is always
true, that that does less please men, which is most grateful unto God.

They that thus serve God, and ^oue him for such an end, as yet ^hey have not
fully received the spirit of the adoption of the sons of God: but only of
servants, and therefore they are ^ather to be called hyrelings, then sons:
for their chiefest intent ^s their own commodity. Cer^aynely my Lord, he does
not ^s yet know thy goodness, who so ^oueth thee: neither does he as ^et know of
what might and ma^estie thou art, or what thou art, ^ho after this manner
seeks a^y thing without thee.

He that thus loves thee, does ^ot love thee with a chaste and pure ^oue, as
the love of the Spouse is ^owards her Bridegroom: but ^ith a fained and
mercenary love, ^s that is of whoores and harlots, who rather respect the
commodity and the pleasure, then the persons, whom they love. Wha^ is more
foul and filthy, the^ to love God with such a love?

Hence also arises another error, and that not a little one, tha^ is, when as
we greatly esteem o^ (as we said before) the exercise of prayer, and contemn
the exercise of mortification.

For that there is pleasure i^ the one, and grief in the other and man's heart
does reject the one, and embrace the other, dot^ embrace that which delights
and reject that which tormenteth;

This is the cause, that we se^ many diligent in hearing of Divine service and
Sermons, an^ very long and copious in prayer and do diverse times receive the
holy Communion; and are willing to speak of God, and also glad to hear others
speak of The abuses of many that would seem devout.
him; and do cheerfully converse with godly and religious men; and yet are
prone unto anger, lust, ambition, and obstinate in their own conceits and
opinions; neither will give place or depart a hair from their own right,
neither do they cease to detract and backebite others. They are merry and do
seek to fare deliciously, to live daintily, to eat and drink of the best, to
cloth their body sumptuously, and to use themselves effeminately; yet
nevertheless for all ^his they would live devoted unto God, and have society
and familia^ity with him. Hence it is, that if ^t any time they find not that
ac^ustomed sweetness in prayer, which they desire, forthwith they ^ast down
their heads, loose their patience, and weep, because they could not weep in
prayer: and they most plentifully power forth tears, not tears of devotion,
but of impatience. And such, as for this cause do weep, do not shed tears
because they see themselves full of anger, pride, coueteousnes, self love, and
many other vices, and destitute of humility, charity, and other virtues, more
necessary then those tears are.

And this error does so far exceed, that some of them have their Devotion
in such regard and reckoning, that they either neglecte, or contemn true
righteousness, to the which notwithstanding they are bound by the divine law.
They think that they have most grievously offended, if they do not every day
hear divine service; if that every day they do not make an end o^ those
prayers, they have appointed unto themselves, and so satisfy the calender of
their devotion, which if they have not done, they can neither eat nor drink
quietly; when as in the mean time they can sleep soundly and sweetly, having
their coffers and chestes stuffed full of rich garments and rustie coin, never
considering that there are so many poor and naked, which perish and faint
through hunger and cold. Their conscience full of faults and crimes does not
take away their sleep, neither does it hinder their rest, although it be
clogged with the burdens of many debts, which they are able to repay, but do
not. And also when as they have not for many years saluted their neighbor by
reason of an inueterate hate to the great scandal of much people: neither have
regarded those things, which belonged to their estate, and unto the condition
of their family, yet for all this they have securely slept, and not any whit
have bin trobled or disturbed for it. And yet if any of these things do offer
themselves unto them, especially if they have any trouble, or difficulty
annexed unto them; they utterly reject them, pull back their hands, and say;
that by this labor their heart is distracted, and their Devotion hindered;
which is none other thing, then to forsake the head for the feet: for they
make more account of the quiet of their heart, which disposes unto prayer,
then of the obedience of the Divine law, unto which prayer is disposed.

It is likely that such men never read that of our Savior; Not every one that
says unto me, Lord, Math. 7.
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that does my Fathers
will which is in heaven.

This Devotion without the foundation of righteousness is one of the principal
and most universal errors, that are wont to meet with man in this way, for it
altogether destroys a spiritual life in every body. For whereas the end of
this life is the fulfilling of the divine law, and the means, by which we
attain this end is prayer (as we have often said) this error without
question peruerteth this order; for of the end it makes a mean, and of the
mean, makes the end, and so it confounds all things.

I would to God that they were very few, who in this respect were deceived:
But I fear, seeing that the kingdom of self love is very large, least also
the plague, which springs from it, be very general; albeit in some one
respect it expatiateth more, then in another: yet few there be, that are
altogether free from it.

Neither let any one think that this Doctrine is contrary unto that, which
before we have delivered, as concerning the too much business in external
matters: for that does rebuke them that altogether forsake the exercise of
prayer, that they may attend upon exterior labors: and this that we have
here said, is contrary to the other extreme, and does blame them, that so give
themselves to prayer, that they will not entermeddle with any external
business, although it be very necessary. Both of these are extremes, which
virtue does always abhor, consisting in (...) mean.

For our businesses ought not to be so many and so great, as to choke our
prayer; nor our prayer ought to be in such esteem, that for it the works of
virtue be neglected, which are proper unto our estates and callings.

OF A REMEDY MOST profitable and avayleable against all these kinds of errors.
CHAP. LII.
HE therefore that would be freed from all these errors, let him set down unto
himself the last end of all his labors and troubles to be the keeping of the
law of God, and the observing of his most holy will, and also the mortifying
of his own will: let him use the sweetness of prayer to temper and qualify the
cup of bitterness, and let him assuredly persuade himself, that by how much the
more any one drinks of this cup, by so much he has profitted; and by how
much less any one has drunk of it, by so much he has less profitted.

Let him diligently mark, how much he daily profitteth in humility, as well
in that which is inward, as in that which is outward: how he brooketh the
injuries, that are done unto him: how he succourerh the infirmities of others,
and releeueth the necessities of his neighbor; how he has a fellow feeling of
his brethrens miseries; how he reproacheth not the escapes and falls of his
neighbor: and how he has learned to hope in the Lord, when tribulations are at
hand; how he moderateth his tongue, keeps his heart, bridleth the flesh with all her lusts and concupisences, how he governs and ordreth himself, as well
in adversity as in prosperity, that he be not cast down of the one, nor puffed
up of the other. How he carries himself in all things with gravity and
discretion. But before all things let him diligently consider, whether the
love of honor, of pleasure, of the world, and of such like affections be
killed and mortified in him, and according to the rule, that every one shall
find in himself, let him so judge: and not according to the quantity of
sweetness, which he shall feel in prayer.

But if we would attain unto Mortification is necessary.
our true end indeed, it ought not to be sufficient unto us, to have looked
unto prayer: but it is also requisite, that with one eye, and that with the
best, we have a regard unto mortification, and with the other unto prayer. If
we will do this, at the length we shall come unto true contemplation.
Otherwise prayer will profit nothing without mortification: neither can perfect
mortification be had, without the help of prayer.

For prayer and mortification are as two sisters, one of which does help the
other in all things, that are to be done.

Which two virtues were figured The two Alters in the temple of solomon what
they signify.
and pointed at by those two Alters, that were in the temple of Solomon; upon
one of which, sacrifices were always offered; and upon the other nothing but
incense.

By the Alter of Sacrifice, on which diverse living creatures were daily killed
and sacrificed, mortificatio^ is understood, whose duty it is, to sacrifice
and cut off the heads of our appetites: By the Alter of incense, prayer is
meant, which like incense kindled by the Divine love, does ascend out of our
hearts even up to heaven, and there does deal with God about the dispatch of
our business.

He therefore that after this manner desires to be the Temple of the living
God, let him have in his Soul these two Alters: one is his superior part,
where always may fume the incense of prayer, and meditation, that that of the
Psalmographer may be fulfilled:

O how love I thy law, it is my Psalm. 119.
meditation continually. The other in his inferior part, where always he may
offer Sacrifices of his concupiscences and appetites; that that of the Apostle
may be done; Mortify your members which are on the earth, fornication, and
uncleanness, inordynate Colos 3.
affection, evil concupiscence and coueteousnes which is idolatry.

This is that myrrh, of which the Spouse speaks in the Canticles: I will go,
says she, into the mountain of myrrh, and to Cant. 4.
the hill of incense.

For as by incense prayer is understood, so by myrrh mortification is meant:
which is most bitter unto our taste, but most precious in the sight of God, and
of most acceptable savor. Neither does it want a mystery, that myrrh is
attributed to the mountain, and incense to the hill: perhaps that it might be
insinuated, how mortification is far more excellent then prayer, as well in
difficulty, as in dignity. For as an universal mortifying of all our appetites
is more difficult Mortification is difficult.
then prayer, so also it is more excellent and more necessary. And as the hill
is the way unto the mountain, and the means to ascend unto it, so prayer is
the way, and the ascending to mortification. Therefore the servant of God is to
be admonished, that the more sweetness he feels in prayer, the more cheerfully
he prepare himself unto greater troubles: considering that ^t is meet and
requisite, that he suffer for that Lord, by whom he has been dealt with so
lovingly and so tenderly: and let him weigh and mark that these consolatio^s
which are given unto him, are but breathings bestowed upon him to this end,
that with greater courage he may return into the field.

And we are faithfully to mark and consider, that at that very Christ in the
glory of his tra^sfiguration did speak of his passion.
time, when the Lord was transfigured upon the mount, when his face did shine
like the Sun, and his garments were as white as snow: I say that at that very
time, in the midst of so great joys he spoke of those things, which afterward
he was to suffer at Jerusalem. What? had the business of his passion any
fellowship or participation with his transfiguration? If music be unseasonable
in the time of mourning; shall not mourning in like manner be unseasonable in
the time of music, and publ^ke rejoicing? Truly this has place at the feasts
and meetings of this world; but not in divine solemnities, where consolations
are given for tribulations: rest for torment; and for the cross
transfiguration. So that as often as the servant of God feels any comfort,
let him assuredly know, that he is cited, and provoked unto a new combat: and
as these consol^tions do bind a man unto tribulations; so we must think,
that we are called unto tribulations, as often as we feel that we are
comforted. Therefore as a diligent and careful tr^ueller, that enters into an
A Simily.
Inn, that he may break his fast, eats, and withal is careful to make an
end of the voyage he has taken in hand, so that although his body be in the
Inn, yet his heart and mind is about his journey: so also the servant of God,
when he goes to pray, let him on the one side enjoy celestial sweetness, and
on the other side let him purpose to bear troubles and molestations for his
love, of whom he is so much made of, and who will not have any one to eat his
bread, but in the sweat of his face.

Let this then be the end and scope of this business; that before all things we
write in our hearts these words of our Savior: If any man will come after me,
let him deny himself, and take up his cross Luke. 9.
daily, and follow me. And because this cross can hardly be taken up, unless
we be helped by the fortitude and alacrity of prayer: therefore we betake our
selves to this virtue, as to a most faithful guide, which does bring us to
this end. Therefore that we desire, is not denied unto us, but granted: and
God does bestow upon us spiritual consolations; ^ot that we should rest in
them, ^ut that we should be refreshed and encouraged by them, to as^end even to
the top of this glo^ious mountain. This is that which the Prophet wished and
^rayed for, when he said: Rejoice Psalm. 8.
^he soul of thy servant: for unto ^ee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. And in
another place, My soul ^all be satisfied, as with marrow Psalm.
^d fatness (so with devotion) and ^y mouth shall praise thee with ^yfull
lips. Therefore after this ^anner, and to this end, we ought (...) use divine
consolations: not ^ly that we may be delighted ^ith them, but rather that we
^ay be afflicted: as that holy ^ule used them, of whom it is ^yd: She
ouerseeth the ways of Pro. 31.
her household, and eats not the bread of idleness.

THE ELEVENTH ADmonition, that visions and revelations are not to be desired.
CHAP. LIII.
OF those things, which hitherto have been spoken of, this also is concluded:
If we are not to seek for divine consolations, and spiritual delights that we
should rest in them, o^ that by them we should only b^ delighted; much less
are reue^lations, visions, inspirations, o^ such like to be desired: for this
i^ the very beginning of diabolical^ illusions. Neither let a man fear^ that
for this he shall be disobedient to God, if he shut all his gates against all
such things: for God knows, if he at any time will reveal any thing unto
man, how to find an entrance, and to open his gates after that manner, that he
cannot doubt, but certainly know, that God is present. So he dealt with Samuel
being yet a child, when he called him once, 1. Reg. 3.
twice, and the third time: and he told him all things, that he would have him
to know, so manifestly, that not any scruple remained unto him, neither could
he doubt of his embasie.

THE TWELFTH ADmonition, that the divine graces are not boastingly to be
revealed. CHAP. LIIII.
Our scholar, that goes unto the school of devotion, i^ here also to be
admonished, that he do make no vain boast no^ brag of those favors, graces,
and benefits, which God now and then is wont to bestow upon his friends in
their prayers. This is of so great moment, that a deuou^ man, according to the
council of S. Bernard, ought to have written upon the walls of his Oratory
that sentence of the Prophet; My secret unto my self, my secret Esaias. 24.
unto my self. Many do far o^herwise, who with full mouth at ^ll occasions
do proclaim their ^euotion, neither can they rest, ^ntill with great clamours
and ^ublike applause they have di^ulged that abroad, which they ^ele within.
This (says a cer^aine Doctor) proceeds not ^f the greatness of devotion, but
^f the incapacity of the heart: which thing often happens vn^ children, when
as new clothes, A Simily.
(...) new shoes are given unto ^em; who cannot contain the^^lues, but that
they must show ^em to every one they meet. ^ut these men the more they ^ast of
these graces, the more ^pty and destitute they are. For ^en as fire, or any
odoriferous (...) fragrant smell, the more it is A Simily.
^uered and kept close, the more ^d longer it preserves the sent, and keeps
the heat: so also the love of GOD and Devotion.

There be others also, that under pretense and color of charity with the
secret danger of le^ nitie, do reveal to their friend^ all the blessings they
have received of God: not considering that these benefits, which we^ have, are
with greater diligenc^ to be concealed, for the dange^ of vainglory, then the
sinn^ we commit, for fear of i^ famye.

For this cause we are to keep^ our secrets in all things, in whi^ there
lurketh any occasion of v^nitie or danger: which thing o^ Savior would
intimate, wh^ he commanded his disciples (...) conceal the mystery of (...)
glorious transfiguration: w^ thing he also observed in man other miracles: he
did this, not ^or any danger he feared to ^ome unto himself, but for our
^xample, that we should do ^he like.

^HE THIRTEENTH admonition, of the fear and reverence, which we are to
observe, when we stand in the presence of the Lord. CHAP. LV.
FVrthermore let a man also observe this, that when he ^alketh with God in
prayer, he ^oe it with as great humility ^d reverence as may be: So ^at albeit
his soul be as it were ^nderly embraced and cherished of God, and adorned with
man^ graces and favors, so that it hat^ attained that estate, that it man say
with the Spouse: His left han^ is under mine head, and his righ^ hand does
embrace me: yet let hi^ turn his eyes into himself, an^ behold his own
vildnes, and b^ humbled, and tremble before s^ great a Majesty. This is that^
which the Prophet says: Seru^ the Lord in fear, and rejoice (...) trembling.
Rejoicing with trembling is a new thing and vnhear^ of: but both of them are
necessary, when we come to a Lord of so great goodness and maiesty^ and by how
much the soul shall be more pure, by so much shall the humility be more
acceptable: for it is written: A wom^ holy and modest, is a grace about grace.

Neither let a man think tha^ the fire of love is extinguished by this
affection of fear: but let him certaynely believe, that none other thing is
done here, then if we should cast a little water into a hot burning furnace,
that it might burn the more vehemently. For when as the soul on the one side
does meditate upon the infinite immensitie of the divine great^es, and on the
other side, upon ^he bottomless pit of her own ^ildnes; by how much more she ^s
afraid of her self for this difference, by so much she does more admire the
incomparable goodness of God, who does so ^ebase himself, that he is not
a^hamed to embrace so lovingly (...) creature so vild. Moreover, as ^uch as the
admiration of the ^iuine goodness increases, so ^uch increases the love, the
joy, and thanksgiving for so great a benefit, with all other fruits and
motions of the holy Ghost, which are wont always to dwell in such souls,
which Esaias signifies saying; To whom shall I look? even to him that i^ Esaias.

low. And if this guest be so acceptable in the eyes of men; ho^ much more
acceptable shall he b^ in the eyes of God, whose natu^ is to resist the proud,
and to gi^ grace unto the humble and lowly*

THE FOVRTEENTH admonition, that sometimes we must pray longer, then at other
some. CHAP. LVI.
WE said before that the servant of God ought to set down unto himself
certain times to pray in, as we read that Daniell did in times past, Dan. 6.
who thrice a day prayed upon his knees.

That David did the like, it is manifest by that which he says; In the
evening and morning, Psalm. 55.
and at noone day will I pray, and that instantly, and he shall hear my voice.
Now let us add besides the ordinary time of every day, that a man ought at
certain hours, (all other business set apart, although it be spiritual) wholly
to give himself unto prayer and meditation, and that more plentiful food be
bestowed upon the soul, to repair that, which was consumed by daily defects,
and that strength may be gotten to proceed further. For as the children of
this world besides their A Simily.
daily repast, have their extraordinary feasts and bankets, in which they are
wont to exceed the manner of other refections: so it is also behoouefull, that
the righteous besides their daily prayer have their feasts and spiritual
bankets, in which their souls may feed not measurably (as at other times) but
may be filled and stuffed with the divine sweetenes, and with the plenty of
Gods house.

We see that nature is not content with the deaw, that in the A Simily.
night time falls upon the earth, but also now and then it rayneth, and that
plentifully, not for a week, but oftentimes longer; for so it is necessary,
that the heavens should be now and then more liberal toward the earth, and
should so glut it, that neither the sun, nor the wind may make it dry: So
also our soul besides the common and daily deaw, ought to have certain
peculiar times, in which our eyes may do none other thing, then shower down
most plentiful tears of devotion; by which our soul may be so filled with
the virtues and juice of the holy Ghost, that all the tribulations, and all the
winds of this world may not dry it.

Albeit this course is lawdable at any time, yet especially at the chief
solemnities and feasts of the year: neither is it less necessary in the time
of trouble, or after deliverance from some offense, or after disturbance in
some ouerth wart business, then the recreation and refection of the body is
necessary after long infirmity. For otherwise a man cannot turn unto
himself, nor be renewed, unless he bestow as much time upon his return into
the way, as he spent, when he went out of the way: especially seeing that we
know that Devotion is of the nature of those things, which are easily lost,
but being lost, are hardly recovered.

Of what weight this business is, no man can easily declare; for it may be that
at one of these times greater gifts and graces may be received, then at any
other time. And according to the judgment of the divines, any one act done
with fervor, and earnest zeal, does more increase charity, then many done
with numnes and feeblenes. If this have place in other acts of virtue,
certainly it shall also have place in prayer, which does more traffic with
God by the way of mercy, then by the way of justice: and therefore it may be so
fervent and so zealous, that it may obtain more in one day, then that which is
feeble and dull can obtain in many. Such was the prayer of Sara the wife of
Sara, the wife of Tobias. Tob. 3.
Tobias, who for three days and three nights, did neither eat nor drink, but
continuing in prayer, entreated the Lord with tears. The third day, when she
perceived that her prayer was heard, she gave thanks unto God for her
deliverance. Yet it is credible that she prayed oftentimes before, and
requested the same things, at the hands of God (for it is a most usual custom
among the righteous to run unto God in all their tribulations) but then
especially her prayers entered into the presence of the glory of the great God.
For long instance and hearty perseverance in prayer, does add force and heat
unto it* by which it is lifted up into heaven.

Anna also the mother of Samuel, Anna the mother of Samuel. 1. Reg. 1.
for the recure of a defect that was in her, prayed with such earnestnes and
feruencie, that Ely the Priest, seeing her gesture, the moving of her lips,
and the disposition of her countenance, supposed her drunk, and commanded her
to go out of the Temple. When her prayer was most hot, then it was most
forcible to obtain that she desired, ^hen she rose up, and went away ^erry,
neither afterward looked she sad, because she lost not ^he hope which she had
conceived, until she saw that accomplished, which she desired.

of Constantinople, that when as Arrius came to Constantinople, and by the
commandment of Constantine was now ^o be received into the fellowship of the
Church, the holy Bishop being not ignorant of ^he fraudulent dealing that
Ar^ius used, in his subscribing to ^he Nicene Council, fell into a dangerous
gaynesaying of his admittance, and into a troublesome purpose of disputation
with him; for he wanted no threatenings from Eusebius the Bishop of Nicomedia,
who did patronize the cause of the Arrians. Alexander being in this straight,
before he would receive Arrius into the Communion of the Church, and before he
entered disputation with him, he went apart into the Temple of Peace, shutting
himself there alone, and prostrating himself upon the earth, many days and
nights together with tears, h^ prayed unto GOD, after thi^ manner:

O God, said he, grant for thy mercy and truth sake, that (...) The prayer of

the opinion of Arrius be tru^ that I may never live to see the day appointed
for this disputation: but if the faith that I hold be true, grant that Arrius
the Author of all these mischiefs, may suffer condign punishment for his
impiety.

At the length the day appointed came, Arrius comes forth guarded and
attended upon with the followers and favorers of Eusebius, all the world
looking on, and expecting, what end either the constancy of Alexander, ^r the
pride of Eusebius and Arrius should have. But presently God ^hewed his
revenging power upon (...) wicked and damnable endeavors ^f Arrius, for his
wicked consci^nce stroke fear into him, fear The death of Arrius.
^ade his body soluble and laxa^ue, and going to the draught, ^eere unto the
common place, ^here Constantine kept his courts, together with his excrements,
he ^owred forth his guts, and so exhaled forth his soul: a punishment meet
for such a blasphemous wretch.

I have been more prolixe in this, that those great fruits might more appear,
which are reaped by earnest, and long continued fervent prayer: which also are
wont to be more excellent, when they proceed from any tribulation, and such
like temptation: for these do stir up and kindle the heart of him that
prays, and they add greater feruency unto him; as it happened to that Saint,
who said: I have labored crying unto the Lord, my throat is grown hoarse,
and mine eyes fail me, while I hope in my God. I am sure that many graces are
bestowed by this way, and that more will be bestowed: therefore it is not
needful to stay longer in this admonition; for the experience of them ^s
sufficient, who have perseuered after this manner, who have lear^ed in truth
and verity, what ^mple fruits are reaped by such prayer.

THE FIFTENTH ADmonition, of the discretion, that ought to be used in the
exercise of prayer. CHAP. LVII.
THere be some that want judgment and discretion in their exercises; for when
as all things between them and God have prosperours success; this prosperity
at the length becomes offenciue unto them, and brings an occasion of great
dangers.

For there be some upon whom graces seem to be bestowed with a full hand:
these feeling the fellowship of the Lord so sweet and pleasant, do so drown
themselves in this exercise, and do so long continue in prayer, in watching,
and in other corporal asperityes, that at the length their natural strength
does fail them.

Hence it is that many are troubled with faintness and weakness of stomach,
others are payned with the head ache, others are diseased with the Megram, and
swimming of the brain: by which diseases they are so afflicted, that they
become unfit not only for corporal exercises, but also to pray. Therefore it
is meet and requisite, that things be considered of in the beginning, ^hen the
fervor and consolati^ns be greater, and the experience and discretion less:
that we may (...) learn to walk, that we do not ^ynt in the midst of our
journey.

Of this an answer may be demanded A question.
to a great doubt, moo^ed of a great Divine: to wit, what they ought to do,
that on (...) one side are often visited of God, ^x in this exercise are
enriched by ^im with many graces and benefits: and on the other side the
strength and health of their body ^oth hinder them, that they cannot long
continue in this exercise?

To the which doubt the same The answer
^iuine answers with great humility and fear, saying. Truly it seems unto
me better to love God, and to enjoy him without in^ermission, albeit it be not
with so great feruor and vehemence, the^ to, abound with such heat and
sweetness, and to receive graces with so full an hand: least perchance a little
while after thou fallest into danger, either altogether to loose all these
things, or else that they decrease and diminish in thee.

For I have known many, says he, who after they had lost their health by
such manner of exercise, afterward going about to refreshe and recover
themselves, and seeking to rid themselves of this languorment of body, have
come to that pass, that afterward they have lived not only more delicately,
but also more dissolutely. Therefore to eschew this danger, it is better every
day to proceed a little, and softly to go from the less to the greater, and
so to come to perfection; then by little and little to go back and ^etyre,
until thou returnest unto ^issolutenes: for it is written; An heritage that is
hastily gotten Prou. 20.
^t the beginning, shall not be bles^d in the end. And; Riches Prou. 13.
^athered hastily shall be diminish^d: but he that gathers them ^ith the
hand by little and little, shall ^crease them.

By this it is manifest, how ne^essary the virtue of discretion (...), not
only that we may meet with this inconvenience (which (...) great and very
common) but ^lso with many other. Therefore (...) is necessary that we always
^esire, with all humilitye and ^erseueraunce, light and vnder^anding, saying
with the Pro^het: Lead me forth in thy truth Psalm. 25.
and teach me: for thou art the God ^f my salvation: in thee do I trust ^ll
the day.

The other extreme contrary Against the^ that under color of discretion do
live more delicately.
unto the former is proper unto delicate and effeminate persons, who under
color and show o^ discretion do withdraw they^ bodies from all kind of
labors. It is not easy to judge, whether of these two extremes is more
dangerous: but that indiscretion i^ more incurable; for as long as the body is
sound and whole, there is hope of remedy: but when it is marred and spoiled by
too much indiscretion, there is not any more hope of further good.

^HE SIXTEENTH ^dmonition, that we ought not only to give our selves unto
prayer, but also unto all other virtues. CHAP. LVIII.
THere is also another danger in this way, and per^aps greater then the
former: and it is this. There are ma^y men, who after they have ^yuers times
tasted of the in^stimable virtue of prayer, and ^aue learned, that the whole
^ourse of a spyrituall life de^endeth of it, think that ^rayer is sufficient
alone, and that by it only the pathway to salvation is trodden: whereupon it
follows, that they forget other virtues, neythe^ are they further careful
for any^ so that the more profoundly^ their mind is swallowed up i^ prayer, by
so much they forget other virtues: and so desiring with too much dilygenc^ to
cover and hyde the bette^ part of their body, and repos^ all the other parts
to the fury^ and violence of the enemy.

Hence also it is, that when as other virtues are as it were the foundation of
prayer; tha^ this foundation being taken away, whatsoever is built upon it,
must needs fall: an^ therefore so long as a man a^tributeth too much to this
ve^tue, he shall profit the le^ in it.

For it is certain, that a prayer does dispose unto morti^cation, so also (as
we said be^re) mortification, and all over virtues do dispose unto ^ayer: and
therefore the one without the other is hardlye ^und.

Tell me I pray thee, what kind (...) prayer will it be, unless a ^igent
watch be kept in the ^art, in the tongue, in the eyes, ^d in all the senses,
as well out^rd, as inward? What prayer (...) it be, if the body be stuffed (...)
of meat, and the soul ^und with sundry cogitati^ and lusts of the world?
^erefore those men do labor (...) turmoyle themselves in vain, (...) do
follow after one virtue, (...) do neglect all other: for ^ues are so combined
and ^led together between them^es, that scarcely one can be found without all
the other, (...) all if one be missing.

Hence it is apparent, the The actions of our life are like unto a clock.
this whole business is not v^ like to an artificial, and w^ ordered clock,
in which a^ diverse wheels and ligamen^ amongst which there is the proportion,
that if one of the^ although it be but little, b^ hyndered, the whole fra^
becomes disordered: a^ here this prouerbiall speec^ has place: The shoe
bei^ lost, the horse falls, a^ the horse falling, the rider^ cast down: and
so hee^ after the same manner, by^ little idleness the whole dig^tye, and the
whole good^ this business, and the fruy^ that were hoped by it, are alto^ther
lost.

How often happens it, (...) (...) man rising in the morning, and ^eglecting
the custodye of his ^eart, giving place to some vain ^ought, or worldly
considerati^, how often I say happens it, ^at he cannot afterward cast (...)
out when he would, neither can ^e recollect his spirits, when he ^leaseth,
that in prayer he may ^rmely fix his mind upon God? ^ereupon it follows,
that the ^orning prayer being well or^ered (which is as it were, the di^ctor of
all things to be done ^at day) the whole day is well ^dred, and does happily
succeed, ^d all things do prosper that ^e do that day.

In like manner it follows ^eerupon, that the morning prai^ does dispose unto
the evening ^ayer, and the evening prayer ^to the morning: for the aptnes ^d
concinnity of the one, is the aptnes and concinnity of the other: but if the
one be disordre^ the other also, and whatsoeu^ else depends of it, is easily
d^ordered, and so the whole cloc^ is disturbed and out of frame^ to order which
a new we mus^ go a fresh to labor, and man days do slip away, before (...)
can return unto our selves (...) gain.

But if in the mean time an^ new tempest arise, or any new^ occasion of a new
impedimen^ there also danger arises, an^ great ieopardy. And if thou sha^
diligently enquire, what is t^ seed of so great discommodit^ thou shall now
and then fin^ none other, then some small ne^ligence, by which thou have
^mitted some thought, which (...) not evil, but only inconueni^ and
unseasonable for this ti^ and business.

God does often permit such ^haunces, that he may make his ^eruants more
cautelous, and cir^umspect in all things: not only ^n those things, that are
great and hard, but also in lesser matters: for albeit these be ^mall in
themselves, yet they are great, ^y reason they dispose a man and make him fit
for greater, and therefore it is said; He that fea^eth God, has a care of all
things: as well of small things, as of great: for small things by little and
little bring unto great, neither can small things be preserved without great.

Therefore the servant of God ought not only ^o regard one virtue alone,
although it be great: but he must regard all together: for as one string in a
Lute does not make music, but altogether: so one virtue alone is not
sufficient to make this spiritual harmony, but all must sound together. And
although all these virtues (as we have said) are profitable and avayleable unto
this our present purpose, yet more particularly the keeping of the heart and
senses; the composition and right ordering of the exterior man, temperance in
eating, drinking and speaking are conducent; and all the other (of which we
have spoken before) do help devotion: and he that has not care of these,
shall never come unto perfect prayer.

THE SEVENTENTH admonition, that this exercise is not to be taken for an Art,
or used as an Art, but to be done with great humility and confidence. CHAP.
LIX.
THe lover and embracer of Devotion is also in this place to be admonished,
that all that has hitherto been spoken to stir up Devotion, is as a
preparatiue to prepare man to receive the divine grace: by casting away all
trust in his own strength and merits, and by reposing it in God alone.

I say this; because there are many men, who of all these rules and
instructions do make an art, supposing, that as he that learneth an art, if
he will observe his rules, becomes a cunning workma^: so also they think
that he, that well observes these our rules, shall obtain that he desires
by the virtue of them: not marking, that this is nothing else, then to make an
art of grace, and to attrybute that to the rules of humane art, which is the
pure gift and mercy of the Lord.

The Doctrines of certain spiritual books written as well in prose, as in
verse, have given occasion of this error: which do so exceedingly commend their
rules and their manner of teaching, that some think, that by the benefit of
them, they may obtain that they desire. None otherwise then an Alchimist,
teaching to A Simily.
make chimicke gold, who reaches to his scholar this or that mineral, and
says thou shall thus and thus prepare it, and by and by thou shall have pure
gold: so these men say, do this and that, speak after this manner and after
that, and by and by thou shall have the love and grace of God. This manner of
teaching is stark naught, and far different and dissonant from the style and
grauytye of the holy Doctors: and also unworthy the honor of the divine grace.

For seeing that this whole business is grace and the mercy of God; it is meet,
that it be handled not as though it were of art, but of grace: that by this
manner man knowing what he asks, he may know, that the cheifest means, by
which he ought to dispose himself unto this business, is lowly humility, and
the knowledge of his own misery, with a most firm hope of the Divine mercy:
that by the knowledge of them both, tears may trickle down, and prayers
proceed: by which man being waited upon, he may enter by the gate of
humility, and receive that he desires by humility, and give GOD thanks with
humility: not having any trust, either in himself, or in his exercises, or in
his works.

Which although it be true, yet this admonition and doctrine does not exclude
our labors, or that which we ought to do. For although he that planteth, and
he that waters, is not the same that he is that gives the increase who is
God: yet he wills nevertheless that we should plant and water, that he
may give the increase. No man does doubt, that any thing does so much require a
guide and counsel, as a spiritual life: especially in the joy and consolation
of prayer; which as it is more delicate and divine; so also it requires more
counsel and more instructions.

And as it is unmeet and unjust, that the exercise of prayer should be taught
as an Art, least grace be impaired and offended: so also man is to be
admonished of all those things, that are necessary, least he stumble and fall
in this way. For we see some that after many years do little profit in this
exercise, and others that pass their time over in recyting a number of vocal
prayers, who very sildome do seriouslye think of, either that which
belonges unto God, or that which themselves speak. Therefore our Reader was to
be admonished of both, that his labors may be more fruitful.

THE EIGHTEENTH admonition, of other kinds of prayers and meditations, which
are wont to be used of them, who are more exercised. CHAP. LX.
IT is also to be noted in this place, that those meditations, which we have
divided into exercises for every day of the week, were written especially for
young ^eginners, that they might have ^s it were a thread to lead them, ^east
they wander in this labo^inth, and err in this way as yet ^nknowen.

But when they have once made some proceeding and profit, it is not needful,
that they should always tread in the same path, but it is meet, that they
go, whether the holy Ghost does ^eade the^, who is wont to remove his scholars
from a lower form to a higher. Therefore there are some, that leaving those
considerations do proceed to the meditations of divine perfections, of the
wonders of God, of his benefits, and in the meditation of them do daily more
and more profit, and increase in his love, who is infinitely good, the giver of
all goodness, and wonderful in all his works. There be others, that give
themselves to the meditation of the holy Scripture, which is the Ocean of
infinite wonders and maruels, as many of the holy Doctors did, and many of the
Fathers in the wilderness.

There be also others, that have matter enough to meditate upon, either as
concerning those things that have happened unto themselves, or which they have
seen in others: whether they were the works of grace, or of judgment and
Dyuine justice.

For if a man will open his eyes, and will diligently look into and examine
his own life from the beginning to the end from his conception and natyuity
even to this day, he sha^ find so many and so great things in himself to
be meditated upon, as well benefits and favors, which God has bestowed upon
him, as dangers and perils, which GOD has kept from him, that he shall never
want matter of meditation. But what shall I say of the admirable and wonderful
judgments of God, which happen daily? of the unexpected falls of many, who
thought themselves safe and secure? of the punishments of the divine Justice?
of the miracles of Gods providence? of the works of grace, which we daily see
to work wonders in his servants?

Let not a man sit as a stone upon a stone, but let him behoulde and observe
all those things, which are done upon ye great stage and huge Theater of the
house of God, which always brings forth some nouel, which we may meditate
upon. There be others also more free to whom God has shut the vain of too
much speculation, and has opened the vain of affection, that the will by a
quiet and peaceable understanding may be recreated and made merrye in GOD
alone, bestowing it self wholye upon the love of the cheifest good.

This is the most perfect estate of contemplation; to which we must always
aspire, in which a man does not seek as in the way, set on by the meditation
of love: but in which as in his country he does now enjoy his desired love,
being now found, and in this he rests as in his end, saying with the Spouse,
I have found Cant. (...)
him whom my soul loves, I took hold on him, neither will I let him go. In
this state of meditation, both the labor is less, and the joy and profit
greater. And because the labor of meditation is lesser, the time of
recollection, or of preparation may be a little longer, and yet without the
tyring and wearines of the body. So Moses perseuering in his prayer, his hands
being lift up toward heaven, he obtained victory against Amalech.

THE NINTEENTH and last admonition is, that this exercise is not convenient for
all kind of men. CHAP. LXI.
FVrthermore it is to be observed, that although it be very profitable for
young beginners, to exercise themselves in those meditations delivered in our
exercises; yet this is not altogether simply necessary; much less possible for
all men. For there are many, who by reason of infirmitye, especially of the
head, cannot without great danger, an^ loss of their health, give themselves
unto this exercise, especially if they be young beginners. Others are so bound
unto external business, that they cannot leave it without offense, neither is
any time permitted them, to prepare themselves for these exercises.

There are others, that have their souls so unquiet, undevout, and dry, that
whatsoever diligence they use, it seems to profit them nothing. These ought
not forthwith to break off their prayers, but still continue, crying at his
gate, who will not be wanting to them that with humility and perseverance call
upon him. And albeit the gate be not as yet opened unto them, yet let them not
discourage nor cast down themselves, but wait the Lords leisure, for all good
gifts come from him, and he bestows them upon whom he will, and when he
will. It shall also profit these men, to read some devout and spiritual books
with great attention and understanding, and when they come to those places,
that they have some feeling by, and which does concern their estate, let them
stick long upon them, and lift up their hearts unto the Lord, that he would
shower down upon their dry souls the deaw of his grace. This is the best
remedy, that can be given unto dry and vndeuo^ hearts; for by these means God
oftentimes is wont to lift up men to a deeper study of meditation.

Again there are others, wh^ do consume the whole time (...) their life upon
the recountin^ and thought of their sins an^ transgressions, neither dare
the^ meditate upon the death an^ passion of Christ, or upon any such like
thing, whereby they might receive joy and comfort. These, as we said before,
are not comforted by this, and their understanding is conversant in ignorance;
which Saint Bernard does also confess: For besides that in this exercise some
temp^ation of desperation may be easily suggested, it is also unmeet and
unbeseeming that the ser^ants of God should always walk heavily, and go as
though ^hey were forsaken.

They do contrary unto these, who the first day that they begin, do altogether
forget their sins, and by the lightness of their ^eart would forthwith fly
unto ^e contemplation of higher mat^ers. A downfall is as near unto ^hese, as
to a house without a ^oundation. Who afterward, when they would return to
meditate on lower matters, they cannot, neither do they know the way unto them;
because they have accustomed themselves unto higher and more delicate reaches;
and so they want both the grounds: that is, they can neither walk nor fly.
Therefore it is best for us at the first to be busied with the remembrance of
our sins, rather then with any other thing: afterward by little and little
let us go forward, relinquishing this cogitation, and draw every day more near
and near unto the sacred passion of our Savior, albeit we indeed should
never be without the cogitation and thought of both of them.

If there be any man to be found, that shall find no juice of devotion in these
things that have bin in this book spoken of, and that desires to mediate on
other matters: let him consider and melitate on those things, which per^aine
unto death, and which be^ong unto hell: and afterward ^n those things which
belong unto heaven, or on any other ^ood matter which ye holy Ghost ^oth
suggest unto him, and let ^im not in any wise neglect it, or ^ast it away, but
let him enter by that gate he finds open, for it is that by which God would
have ^im to enter.

THE CONCLUSION of this Book. CHAP. LXII.
Hitherto we have handled (Christian Reader) those four things, which we
promised in the beginning of the book: to wit, we have spoken of those things,
which stir up and procure Devotion: and of those things that hinder it: in
like manner of the more usual and common temptations, which are wont to happen
in this way: and of certain admonitions and counsayles to be observed in this
exercise. I know that many other things may be spoken, but for further
knowledge, I refer the reader to the Magistery of the holy Ghost, and to
daily experience, which he ought to take for a mistres, who will succesfully
walk in this way. For my purpose was none other, the^ that by this my labor I
might bring young beginners into thi^ way; who when they are enter into it,
shall feel and well perceive that experience is a more profitable mistres unto
them, then any humane writings can be: which because they speak ^n general,
they cannot tell, what ^n specialty and particularily be^ongeth to every one.
And therefor the Apostle wills, that the ^eruants of God be not unwise,
Ephesians. 5.
^ut understanding, and wary ^alkers, that by these, and by ^ther means we
may vnder^and, what the will of God is.

It helps also, that a man with ^l humility and devotion conti^ually desire
of the Lord vnder^anding, that in all his ways he ^ay be guided and governed
of ^s spirit, coming into his pre^nce like a child, who knows ^ne other
thing. then to testify ^s necessity by his tears, but ^nnot utter by words,
what is ^cessary for him.

But if any one shall think, tha^ those things which we here teac^ are too
much and too hard, let him assuredly know and believe that God in the time of
prayer i^ wont to recompense all these troubles and greeuances with a^
incredible joy, and a courage necessary for the walking in the wa^ of virtue:
which is of so great moment and weight, that all the prosperities of this
world, which ca^ happen unto us, and all the corporal pleasures or favors and
honors of this world being all heaped together upon one, cannot s^ comfort,
nor so exhilerat and reioy^ the heart of man, as a faithful an^ fervent prayer
of two hours.

Neither is there any reason, w^ we should discourage, or c^ down our selves,
because man things are required unto this e^ ercise: for it is manifest, that
the soul infused into the body, is sufficient to make all the members living,
and to move and di^ect the^ unto their several offices and functions, which
are many and ^iuers: so the grace of the holy Ghost, which is a form
superna^rall and divine, when it once has ^ntred into the soul, is sufficient
(...) move and direct it, to the acting ^d executing of all the duties of
spiritual life: for it does illu^inate the understanding, and it ^acheth what
is to be done, and ^hen it is to be done: it moves ^so the will, with all the
inferior ^culties to all that, which is ^edefull to be done. For this ^use the
Wiseman says, That ^e divine Spirit is one and man: for albeit it be one in
sub^nce, yet in his works it is many ^d manyfold: for it is he, that (...) do
all things, that teaches all things, and that works al^ things. So that we
do not attain^ the perfection of virtue by thos^ means, and by that force of
nature, by which the heathen Philosophers attained unto their natural and
moral perfections because they had not this Spirit therefore they were
constrayne^ with tooth and nail to swea^ for each virtue severally, an^
exceedingly to afflict the^selue^ But true Christians, and the chi^ dren of God
besides their ow^ exercises, which are wrought (...) them by the divine grace,
ha^ another especial remedy, wh^ is the spirit of adoption and the heavenly
seed, which bring geth forth in our souls plentiful fruits of true virtue.
