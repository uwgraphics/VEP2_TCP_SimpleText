Forces in the Palatinate: And TO THE RIGHT WORTHY and Religious Lady his Wife:
True Joy in Christ, and full Joy with Christ.

This the rather, because I assure my self, that you are both of you, of the

none accompanied with more Comforts, and those such as may well not
counteruaile only, but even thoroughly weigh down the other. In so much, that I
see not why a Christian Man, though exposed to such a multitude of Crosses,
(were it not for his own, either want of wisdom, or weakness) might not well
live the comfortablest life of any Man in the world, whatsoever estate or
condition of life God has pleased to assign and confine him unto. Nor have
any therefore cause to waiue the profession of Christianity in regard of such
Crosses, as a disconsolate and uncomfortable estate. Of Children we use to say,
that they are (...). Plut. de prolis (...). (...). Incertus Author. (...).
Demberit. apud Stob. c. 74. (...). Eu^ntus apud Plut. de am prol.

even those also that for outward things might well live comfortably without.
How much more have all cause to desire Christian Grace, when the Comforts that
attend it, are so sure and certain, if men be not their own Enemies; yea when
no sound Comfort (as is here showed) can be attained without it? Unworthy is he
of Issue, that (...). Menand. (...). Eurip. Oenomao.

abundantly ouer-counteruailed in the Comfort he has or may have of them. Nor
is he worthy of Christ, that accounts not the Crosses that Christianity and
the Profession of it may procure, (for of other Crosses that worldly men are
alike subject to with such, what need I say ought? and yet let these go also
in the same reckoning with those;) all abundantly^ Romans 5. 2, 3. and 8. 18.
ouer-counteruailed with those spiritual Comforts, that the assurance of Gods
favor toward him in Christ Jesus may afford him, if the Eye of his Soul be
thoroughly opened duly to apprehend it. This mine endeavor is to show in this
weak Discourse; (the weaker, (...). Languente men's and languet una corpore.
because amids much weakness during my late restraint by sickness, out of
broken notes, either reserved by my self, or taken by others from my mouth, as
they are wont to be, at the time of the delivery of it, with addition of such

was by peece-meale put together:) and to encite all good Christians
(notwithstanding such occurrents) to strive and strain themselves Psalm. 13. 4,
5. and 42. 5, 11.
by their cheerful carriage in such cases, to seal, up the truth of it (which
they cannot but acknowledge;) to those that may question it, or make doubt of
it. This was I the rather enduced to take some pains in, supposing that other
weak ones like my self, (for of such am I bold to judge, as (...). Greg. Naz.

THE JOY OF THE JUST: WITH THE SIGNS OF SVCH.
PSALM 97. 11. Light is sown for the Righteous; and Joy for the Upright in
Heart.
AN Musica in (...), importuna narratio.
unseasonable discourse, says Eccles. 22. 6.
Siracks Son, is as Music in Mourning. And to some, peradventure, it will
seem somewhat unseasonable to entreat of (...). Sophocl.
Joy in times of Grief; in such a time especially, when so much cause of
sorrow, that it may well seem a sin not to be in some sort Amos 6. 6.
sick of it. And yet it will not (I hope) prove so unseasonable, if all be
well weighed, to entreat even in such a time of such Joy, as Gods Spirit here
speaks of. For Matthew. 9. 12. (...); Greg. Naz. ep. 66.
when is Physic more seasonable than in time of sickness? Or when had Gods
Children more need of Esai. 40. 1. and 50. 4. and 61. 1. Temporis officium est
solatia dicere certi, Dum do^or in cursu est -Ovid. de Pont. 4. 11.
cheering up, Psalm.
than when they are pressed down with the heauiest crosses and calamities?
Scope.


The very maine Scope and drift of the Psalmist, Matter.
who ever he was, in this Psalm.

The Psalm is Partim (...), partim (...).
partly Prophetical, Parts 2. Doctrine.
and partly Consolatorie. Use. Part 1. Doctrine.


And may well be divided into Doctrine, and Use.

The Doctrine delivered in the Verse. 1-9.
former Part of the Psalm, is concerning the powerful and potent Kingdom of
Christ: the Glory, Greatness, Might, Majesty, and ample extent whereof, is in
most maiesticall manner, and with a style no less stately described from the
first Verse to the tenth.

The Use of the Doctrine is twofold in the rest of the Psalm; Parts 2. Uses 2.
Partly for Encouragement, And partly for Comfort.


First for Encouragement, Use 1.
Verse. 10.
to incite the godly to cleave close unto God, and to depend wholly upon him,
with assured expectation of safety and deliverance from him, as being so
great, so mighty, so potent a Prince.

Secondly, Use 2.
for Comfort, Verse. 12.
to cheer up their hearts that so do, amids those manifold crosses and
calamities that they may chance to be exercised here withal for a while. Text.


Verse. 11.
Between both which is this pithie and golden Sentence inserted, Connection.
inferred as a Corollary upon the former, prefixed as an Introduction unto the
latter; and so shaking hands, as it were, jointly with either: Light is sown
for the Righteous; and Joy for the upright in heart. Division.


In it we may consider; Branches 3.


1. Branch 1.
A Blessing or a Benefit, and that such an one as all desire, Eccles. 11. 7.
(...). Eurip. Iphig. Aul.-(...). Ibid. (...). Dion. Chrysostom. orat. 3.
Light or Joy: for they are both in substance the same: the one put for the
other, as Ester 8. 16. Esai. 50. 10.
elsewhere often, in the former Part; and the one of them expounded by the other
in the latter Part.

2. Branch 2.
The Persons to whom this Benefit belongs, who may therefore lay claim to it,
and justly hope for and expect it; 1 Cor. 15. 19.
those that seem to share least in it, the Just, or the Righteous; that is, as
in the latter part of the Verse it is expounded, all such as are sincere and
upright in heart.

3. Branch 3.
The Manner or Measure, how far forth such either do or may partake in it for
the present: It is sown for them: it is as yet but seedtime with them: some
beginnings of it they have already, and the rest they shall have; but their
Harvest is behind yet, the maine Crop is yet to come. Consider. 3.


We will first join the first and the second together. Consider. 1.
For to speak much of the first apart would be to small purpose.

Then consider somewhat of the third by it self: Consider. 2.


And so pass on to, Consider. 3.
and conclude with the Illustration of the second, ending there our Discourse,
where the Text it self ends.

The maine Point then that in the first place offere^h it self to us,
Consider. 1.
is this; Point 1.
that

Gaudium bonorum est. Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. 14. c. 8.
Light or joy is the Just Man's Lot; Branches 2.
And Nisi justus non gaudet. Senec. epist. 59.
The Just Man's Lot alone.

Joy belongs to the Righteous, and to the Righteous only: None but the Godly
have good or just cause to rejoice. Branch 1.


The Righteous have right to it. Observation 1.


For, Reason 1.
for them it is prepared. There is (...). Greg. Naz. de bapt.
Light and Joy sown for them.

To them it is promised: Reason 2.
Psalm. 68. 4.
The righteous shall be glad and rejoice before God; yea they shall exceedingly
rejoice: And, Psalm. 64. 10.
The Righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in him: and all that be
upright in heart shall rejoice.

To them it shall be performed: Reason 3.
Psalm. 126. 5.
They that sow now in tears, shall reap in Joy. Esai. 35. 10.
The redeemed of the Lord shall return unto Sion: and everlasting joy shall be
upon their heads. Yea when the wicked shall mourn and howl, they shall sing
merrily. Esai. 65. 13, 14.
My servants shall rejoice, when you shall be abashed: my servants shall sing
for joy of heart, when you shall cry out for anguish of heart, and shall howl
again for vexation of spirit.

To them it is in part made good for the present. Reason 4.
Prove. 29. 6.
There is a snare, or a cord, says Solomon, in the sin of the wicked to
strangle their joy with: but the righteous sing and are merry. And, Psalm. 30.
11. and 32. 7.
Thou have turned my mourning into dancing, says David, thou have loosed my
sackcloth, and girt me with gladness.

Unto it they are exhorted. Reason 5.
Rejoice in the Lord, says the Psalmist, ye righteous, as Psalm. 33. 1.
elsewhere, so Verse. 12.
in the very next words to my Text. And, Psalm. 32. 11.
Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye
that are upright of heart. And, Philip. 3. 1.
Finally, says the Apostle, brethren, rejoice in the Lord: And, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17.
Rejoice evermore: And again, Phil. 4. 4.
Rejoice in the Lord always: and yet again, I say, Rejoice. Nor would the
Holy Ghost thus incite to it, if there were not good ground for it. Grounds 2.


Now the Godly have a twofold cause to rejoice: Et res plena gaudio and spes.
Gaudium in re; gaudiu^ in spe. Gaudium de possessione, gaudium de promissione.
Gaudium de praesenti exhibitione; gaudium de futura expectatione, Bern. de
temp. 15.
In regard of what they have; and in regard of what they hope for:

In regard of the present grace and favor of God:

And in regard of their hope of future glory with God:

They are in present possession of the one; they live in expectation of the
other. Ground 1.


First, Branches 2.
for the present: they are Romans 5. 9.
freed from Gods wrath: they are Romans 5. 10.
reconciled unto God; they are Romans 5. 1.
at one again with him; yea they are Ephesians. 1. 6.
in special grace and favor with him.

First, they are freed from Gods wrath. Branch 1.
Which the more heavy and dreadful it is, the greater joy it must needs be for
a man to befreed from it, that was before obnoxious, as we are all naturally,
unto it. Prove. 20. 2. and 19. 12.
The wrath of a King, says Solomon, is as the roaring of a Lion:( Amos 3. 8.
who when he roareth, who trembles not?) and Prove. 16. 14.
as the messengers of death. And what is the wrath then of 1 Timothy 6. 15. Apoc.
19. 16.
the King of Kings, the sovereign Lord, not of men's bodies only, but of their
souls too, able as Genes. 2. 7.
he made both, so Iam. 4. 12. Matthew. 10. 28.
to destroy both in hell fire, Esai. 66. 24.
where the worm never dies, and the fire never decays, and Apoc. 14. 10,
11. Vbimors sine morte, finis sine fine, defectus sine defectu: quia and mors
semper vivit, and finis semper incipit, and defect desicere nescit. Greg. mor.
l. 9. c. 47.
the torment consequently is never at an end? Now what greater joy can there be
to a poor Prisoner, a condemned person, that lies in hourly expectation of
being drawn forth to execution, That through daily fear of death, Hebr. 2.
15. 1 Cor. 15. 31. Quotidie moritur, morte qui assidue pavet. Perit ante vulnus
pavore, cui spiritu^ rapuit timor. Sen. Herc. fur. 4. Si quod ab homine timetur

more bitter, than death; What greater Joy, I say, can there be to such an one,
than to have tidings brought him that his Pardon is procured? We read in our
own Chronicles, of Vicount Lisle in Hen. 8. Francisc. Landav^in Annal. l.1.
and Holinsh. in Hen. 8. an. 34.
some who have been so surcharged and transported with joy thereupon, that
they have even surfetted of it, (as persons that have been long famished,
feeding over greedily upon good victuals, when they come at first again to
them) and have died with it: Their joy has been more than they were able
Quomodo de Tantalo Pindar. Olymp. 1. (...).
to digest. And what greater joy then can there be to a poor distressed soul,
especially having lien some space of time under the heavy apprehension of Gods
wrath, and so having had some kind of Quomodo Bern. ad illud Psalm. 55. 15.
Descendam in infernum viventes. Descendant viventes, ut non descendant
morientes. Ad fratr. de mont. Dei. Sed and Anselm, in deplor. and Gers. super
Magnis. 9.
Hell here out of hell; than to have Ephesians. 1. 17.
the pardon of his sins sealed unto him by God, to have 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.
Luke 24. 47. Act. 13. 38.
tidings hereof brought him by the Ministry of Gods word, and some 1 Cor. 2.
12.
assurance of it given him by the testimony of Gods Spirit? To which purpose
David having upon his experience both of the one estate and the other,
pronounced them to be in a most happy and Psalm. 32. 1.
blessed estate, that have their iniquities forgiven, and are eased of their
sins; concludes his discourse with an incitement of all such to Psalm. 32. 11.
joy and to great joy; as none having better or greater cause than such Act. 2.
38, 41, 46. and 16. 31, 34.
to rejoice. Branch 2.


It is matter of much joy then for a man to be freed from Gods wrath. But the
Godly are not so only. They are not freed from Gods wrath alone, but they are
received into special grace and favor with God. And if Prove. 19. 12.
the favor of a King, Psalm. 146 3, 4. Esai. 2. 22.
a mortal man, whose breath is in his nostrils, be (it is Solomon's comparison)
as the dew upon the grass, or the green herbs, that refreshes, and cheereth,
and makes all to thrive: What a benefit is it then to be in favor with Psalm.
30. 5.
God, in whose favor there is life? yea Psalm. 63. 3.
whose favor is better than life? Since the Godly therefore are Psalm. 5. 12.
and 32. 10. and 103. 4.
girt about, as the Psalmist speaks, with Gods favor, they may well be Psalm.
30. 11.
girt about with joy. And the assurance of it alone being better than life, may
well serve sufficiently to cheer up their hearts even amids those afflictions
that are Eccles. 7. 26.
more bitter than death.

Secondly, the righteous have just cause to rejoice, as in regard of what they
have, so in regard of what they hope for and expect. Romans 12. 12.
Rejoicing in hope, says the Apostle: a second Ground of their Joy. For they
live in hope and expectation of Iam. 1. 12.
a Crown, of Luke 12. 32.
a Kingdom; 1 Cor. 9. 25.
of an incorruptible Crown, Ground 2.
of 1 Pet. 1. 4. Apoc. 1. 21. Luke 1. 33.
an everlasting Kingdom: of a most happy, a most blissful, a most blessed
estate. (...) Antiph. de cboret. Spes duleissima oblectamenta. Sen. ep. 23.
Hope, we say, is the very Heart of the Soul, and the very Life of a Man's
Life. It is that that puts Spirit into our Spirits, and makes our Life to
be Life. (...). Miscrrimum est timere, cum speres nihil. Sen. Troad. 3. Itaque
postquam adempta spes est, lassus cura confec^us animus stupet. Ter. And 2. 1.
An hopeless Life, is an heartlesse Life: And he is a most forlorn man that
has no Hopes. (...). Electra apud Nonnum d^onys. l. 7. (...). Theophyl. ep.
24. (...). Greg. Naz. pro pa^per. Sola spes ^^minem in miserijs consolari

It is that that is wont to support men's Souls, and not to stay them only from
fainting, but to cheer up their hearts, and to fill them with joy, amids many
sore crosses and occasions of much grief. And if worldly hopes can do so
much, being so vain, so Spes incerti boni nomen est. Sen. epist. 10. Fallitur
augurio (...) bona saepe suo^ Ovid. epist. 16. Multa quidem praeter spem scio
multis bona even^sse. ^t ego (...) spem decepisse multos. Plaut. Rud. 2. 3.
uncertain: How much more may a Christian man's hopes; (for there is Romans 8.
24. Heb. 11. 1.
no man that lives more by hope than he; nor has any man better, or greater,
or surer hopes than he has:) being so great, that he cannot possibly hope for
so much, but he shall receive much more; and he shall find, when he comes to
it, as the Queen of 1 King. 10. 6, 7.
Saba told Solomon, Ephesians. 3. 20. Esai. 64. 4. 1 Cor. 3. 9.
that the one half was not told him: so certain; that he is as sure of what
he hops for, as if already he had it; (for this Romans 5. 5. Spes (...)
confundit. Spes in terrenis incerti nomen* boni: Spes in divinis nomen est
certissimi. Hebr. 11. 1.
hope never fails: and Romans 8. 30. Quia jam fecit quae futura sunt. Aug. de
corrept. and great. c. 9.
those that God has justified, those he has glorified; they are as sure to be
glorified, as if already they were) How more, I say, may (...). Greg. Naz. in
Julian. 1. Spes inconcussa.
these hopes of the godly, being so good, so great, so sure, so certain, fill
their hearts with joy amids all occasions of grief? Luke 10. 20.
Rejoice, says our Savior, your names are written in heaven. And Matthew. 5.
11, 12.
when men persecute you, and put out your names, and revile you, and speak all
the evil that may be of you; even then rejoice ye, and be glad; for great is
your reward in heaven. And, Romans 5. 1, 2, 3.
Being justified by faith, says the Apostle, we are at peace with God, and we
rejoice in hope of the glory of God: yea we rejoice in tribulations. And,
wherein (that is, in the hope whereof) ye greatly rejoice, says S. Peter,
though for a season ye be in heaviness by means of manifold afflictions.

So that if either the enioyment of Gods present favor, Conclusion.
or the assurance of future glory, may either of them alone severally, and much
more both of them jointly, well and sufficiently counteruaile and ouer-weigh
all matter of grief whatsoever; then it is apparent that the godly being
presently possessed of the one, and as sure to have, as if they were already
possessed of it, the other, can never want, if they could see it, much matter
of joy.

Psalm. 149. 5. Gaudeant sancti.
Let the Saints therefore rejoice, Branch 2. Observation 2.
says the Psalmist. But, Hosh. 10. 1. Etia^si leta tibi obveniant omnia, no^
est tamen quod laeteris. Riber. ibid.
Rejoice not thou, Israel, says the Prophet Hoshe, so long as thou go a
whoring from thy God. The godly may well joy, but Non potest gaudere nisi
sortis, justus, and temperans. Sen. ep. 59. Stulti ac mali non gaudent. Ibid.
The wicked can have no true joy; Reason 1.
the ungodly have no cause at all to rejoice.

First, the wicked can have no true Joy, because they have not Gods Spirit. For
true Gal. 5. 22.
Joy is a fruit and an effect of the Spirit. Now where the root is not, the
fruit cannot be: Potest esse radix sine stipite, stipes sine fructu: sed nec
stipos nec fructus sine radice.
there may be a root without a stock, as when Job 14. 7, 8. Dan. 4. 14, 15.
a tree is hewn down, or a bush cut up; and a stock without leaf or fruit,
as in winter time; but neither fruit nor stock where the root is not. But
wicked men Jude 19.
have not the Spirit. As Romans 8. 9.
they are none of Christ's that have it not; so none have it that are not
Christ's. And wanting the root therefore, they cannot have the fruit, which
springing from it, cannot possibly be without it. For (...). Aristot. analyt.
post. l. 2. c. 11. and r^et. l. 2. C. 22.
how can an effect be without the cause of it?

Secondly, (...). Sept. Esai. 57. 21. Gandere non est impijs. Aug. de Civil. l.
14. c. 8 and in Psalm. 96.
there is no joy to the wicked; Reason 2.
because there is Non est pax impijs. Esai. 48. 22.
no peace to the wicked. For there can be no true joy, where there is no inward
peace; ( Romans 14. 17.
Righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost: and, Romans 15. 13.
The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace: and, Galat. 5. 22.
The fruit of the Spirit is joy and peace, says the Apostle.) no sound and
solid joy, where there is nothing but disquiet and distraction, nothing but
terror and horror, nothing but apprehension and expectation of wrath. But Job
15. 20, 21.
the wicked, says Job, is like a woman that is always in travel; there is a
noise of fear ever in his ear. Esai. 57. 20, 21. Nihil stultitia pacatum
habet. Tam superne illi metus est quam infra: ad utrumque trepidat latus.
Sequ^ntur pericula and occurrunt. Ad omnia pavida, imparata est: and ipsis
terretur auxilijs. Sen. ep. 92.
They are as the raging Sea that casts up mire and dirt, says the Prophet
Esaias: There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked. A seeming Pax infida, pax
incerta. Vti de Romana cum Samnitibus transactione, Live. hist. l. 9.
uncertain peace they may have; but they are never safe, no where sure, seem
they never so secure. Noli huic tranquillitati confidere. Momento temporis mare
evertitur; and eadem die ubi luserunt, sorbentur navigia. Sen. epist. 4.
It is but, Reason 3.
says the Heathen man, like the calmenes of the sea, that seems sometime so
smooth that men may play upon it at pleasure, but if there arise but some
sudden flaw or gust of wind, as there does often in an instant, all is turned
topsie turuy, and where men were pleasantly sporting themselves a little
before, there whole ships are now swallowed up. The wicked therefore having no
sound or sure peace, they can have no serious or settled joy.

Thirdly, Light and Joy are put the one for the other. Ester 8. 16.
The Jews had gladness, and light, and joy, says the Story. And there can
be no joy, where is no Light. Tobit. 5. vulg. edit. (...). Dion. Chrysostom. orat.
4. Nec frustra praedicant mentes hominum nitere liquido die, coacta nube
flaccescere. Symmach. epist. 31.
What joy can I have, says blind Tobie, when I sit in darkness, and do not
see the light of heaven? Now the Godly indeed as they are called Ephesians. 5. 8.
Light, and Luke 16. 8. John 12. 36. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 5.
Children of light; so they are said 1 Thessalonians. 5. 4. 1 John 2. 9.
to be and 1 John 2. 10.
abide in the light, and John 12. 35. 1 John 1. 7.
to walk in the light, even Psalm. 89. 15.
in the light of Gods countenance. But all wicked ones as they are called
Ephesians. 5. 8.
Darkness, and the 1 Thessalonians. 5. 5.
Children of darkness; the prince they serve is called Ephesians. 6. 12.
the Prince of darkness, and the State that they live in Coloss. 1. 13.
a kingdom of darkness; so they are said 1 John 1. 6. and 2. 11.
to walk in the dark, 1 John 2. 9.
to be and 1 John 2. 11.
abide in the dark, Esai. 9. 2. Luke 1. 79.
to sit in darkness and in a deadly shade. Nor is there hope of ever altering
or mending this their estate, unless they alter and amend themselves. For Jude
13. Job 10. 21, 22.
the blackness of darkness, (or darkness as black as pitch, darkness more
palpable than that Exodus 10. 22, 23.
of Egypt was) is reserved and laid up for them (not for a few days, but) for
ever. As they Esai. 9. 2.
walk in darkness, so they walk unto darkness, Sunt enim modo in tenebris
exteris, unde correctio desperanda non est; quam si contempserint, ibunt in
tenebras exteriores, ubi correctionis locus no^ erit. Aug. ep. 120. c. 22.
Abistis exteris tenebris in exteriores mitte^tur, qui ex istis exteris non ad
interiora convertuntur. Ibid. c. 36. In tenebras ex tenebris inoeliciter
exclusi infoelicius includendi. Idem homil. 16.
from spiritual darkness that holds them here for a time, to that Matthew. 8.
12.
utter, that eternal Ignis gehennae lucebit miseris ad miseriae augmentum, ut
videant unde doleant; sed non lucebit ad consolationem, ut videant unde
gaudeant. Greg. mor. l. 9. c. 49. Isidor. de sum. bon. l. 1. C. 31. and Ludolf.
vit. Christ. l. 2. c. 88.
darkness, wherein is nothing but weeping and gnashing of teeeh; which when
they are once entered into, they shall never get out of again. And seeing then
that there can be no joy without light: there can be no true joy to any wicked
man, wanting true light.

Now this first may serve to confute and control the preposterous and
erroneous conceit of worldly men, that think to find joy where it is not to
be had; think there is no joy where it is alone to be had.

1. That think to find and attain true joy without Faith, Use 1.

civit. l. 14. c. 8. Improprie locutus, cum nullum gaudiu^ malu^ sit. Sen. ib.
a counterfeit shadow of mirth in stead of true joy.

For what sound or inward joy can from outward things accrue? Reason 1.
It is Quodcunque invectitium gaudium est, fundamento caret. Senec. epist. 23.
Fragilibus inaititur, qui adventitio laetus est: exibit gaudium, quod intravit.
Ibid. 98.
a groundless joy that comes from them; such as may like a little
counterfeit complexion, alter the look and smooth the face outwardly, but never
thoroughly fill, or truly cheer up the soul inwardly. The ground of all true
and sound joy must come from within, it must have his rooting in the soul;
else it is but (...). Greg. Naz. in Julian. 1.
as weeds that grow on the top of the water, that float aloft, but can take no
sure hold, because they never come at, nor do spring up from the bottom. Cast
as many clothes as you will upon a dead corpse, you shall never be able to put
any natural heat into it. No, (...). Plut. de Virt. and Vit.
the garments that we wear must receive heat from the body, before they can
return any warmth again unto it. And there must be matter of joy and comfort
from within, Reason 2.
ere any sound joy or comfort can accrue from any thing without.

Again, what sound joy or comfort can any man have, so long as he is forth of
Gods favor? For no creature can comfort, where he discomforteth. Romans 8. 31.
If God be for us, says the Apostle, who can be against us? But Si co^tra nos,
quis pro nobis. Petr. Cell. ep. 112.
if God be set against us, who can be for us? What joy could Haman have of the
favor of his fellow-Courtiers, when Ester 7. 6, 7.
King Assuerus frowned upon him? He might well have said then, as he had
formerly said in another case, Ester 5. 13.
All nothing avails me, as long as Assuerus frowneth on me. Or what comfort
found Baltasar in the furniture of his Table, the honor of his Princes, the
state of his Palace, or the multitude of his Provinces, when the finger of God
writ him his destiny on the wall, Dan. 5. 5, 6.
which he feared so much before he heard what it was? What sound joy can there
be to a malefactor condemned to die a most cruel death, and to suffer so much
torture before he die, that Job 3. 20, 21. Morsqueminus poenae quam mora mortis
habet. Maximin. el^g. 1. Caius non temere in quenqua^, nisi crebris and minutis
ictibus animadverti passus e^, perpetuo notoque jam praecepto, ita fieri ut s^

It is the state of every wicked one. He is, while he so continues, but a

the chains of a guilty conscience, ready to pinch and gall him, if they but
a little streitned: howsoever therefore he riot and revel here, and strive to
pass over pleasantly the time of his restraint, having by his Iailors leave
and permission, the liberty of some part of this his prison; yet he can never
be truly joyful, never heartily merry, so long as he remains so: His mirth
it is not hearty, it is but strained, or it is but a mere delusion, a fools
paradise at the most. There can be no cause in the world therefore of rejoicing
to any man, till he be reconciled unto God. Because though a man had all the
world, yet could all the world do him no good, Anne magis ficuli genuerunt
era tyranni? Aut magis auratis pendens laquearibus ensis Purpureas subter
cervices terruit, Imus Imus praecipites, qua^ si sibi dicat, and intus Palleat

historiam, cui caratione Dionysius confirmavit, Nihil esse ei beatum, cui
semper aliquis terror impendat. Cic. Tuscul. l. 5.
so long as the heavy wrath of God hangs over his head, as the sword did
sometime over the head of the Tyrants Flatterer, ready every hour to seize on
him, and hell-mouth gapeth under him, ready as soon to receive him. He may
out of ignorance of his own estate, slumber a while in security, or apply
himself to some flashie pleasures; but if he saw his own estate, if he knew
his own plight, he would rather Iam. 5. 1, 2.
houle and weep every hour all his life long.

A second conceit of worldly men, Error 2.
is, that they think there is no joy there, where it is only to be had: There
is no joy, they think, to be found in the good ways of God. It is the conceit
of many, and it keeps many back from looking that way, that if a man set
foot once into Gods ways, all his joy is instantly dashed and lost, all his
mirth is marred, he must never look to live merry hour after: Whereas indeed
it is clean contrary. (...). Philo de malora^ insid. Sola virtus praestat
gaudium perpetuum, securum. Sen. ep. 27.
There is no true joy but there; no sound mirth to be found in any thing
elsewhere. Thou shall never be truly merry, till thou be truly godly, till
thou art become sincerely religious. Gaudium proprium bonorum and piorum est.
Aug. de civit. Dei, l. 14. c. 8.
True joy is proper and peculiar to the godly alone. It is Galat. 5. 22.
a fruit of Gods Spirit; which they alone have: it is Romans 14. 17.
a branch of Christ's kingdom, which they only belong to. As the Heathen man
says, that Amabit sapiens; cupient caeteri. Afra. Solus sapiens scit amare.
Sen. epist. 81. Gaudebit sanctus; caeteri lascivient, vel gestiunt, ut Aug. de
sermon. in most. l. 1. Gaudium nisi sapienti non contingit. Sen. ep. 59.
A wise man only loves, others but dally and lust only: so others may revel,
the godly only rejoice. Christianity and piety does Existimas me nunc
detrahere tibi multas voluptales. Imo contra. Noli tibi unquam deesse
laetitiam. Volo illam tibi domi nasci: nascitur, si modo intra teipsum sit. In
very gaudij possessione esse te volo, quod nunquam deficiat. Ad solidum conor

quam ventris. Aug. de verb. Dom. 27.
not call men away from joy; but it inuiteth them to true joy, to sound joy, to
incessant and everlasting rejoicing. It does Isaacum, i. gaudium jugulandum
tibi formid^s? securus esto. Non Isaak, sed aries mactabitur: non peribit tibi
laetitia, sed contumacia, cujus utique cornua vepribus haerent, and sine

not quell and kill, or quench our mirth; it does only correct and qualify it,
that it may be such as it should be, and such as is behoouefull for us for it
to be. Sapiens laetitia fruitur maxima, continua, sua. Sen. ep. 72.
The Christian man may live as merrily as any man in the world may: yea his
life may well be the merriest of any man's under the Sun. Since that Psalm. 36.
9. Hunc it a fundatum necesse est sequatar hilaritas continua, l^titia alta
atque ex alto veniens. Sen, de bent. cap. 4.
he draws his mirth from the Wellhead, where there is joy and pleasure Gods
plenty; where there is Satietas gau^torum amoenissimorum. Psalm. 16. 11.
fullness of most delightful joys, and Torrens delitiarum. Psalm. 36. 8.
streams of pleasures that flow for ever. For to omit that Godliness does not
debar or restrain a man of the use of any honest and lawful natural
delight; much less deprive him of all comfort and Haec quoque fortuita tunc
delectant, cum illaratio temperavit and miscuit. Sen. ep. 72.
delight in the use of them. A Christian man has a good right unto, and a just
interest in all things procured for him by Christ, and in him again restored
to him, (though by his first Parents default forfeited) and among other things
also even to the comforts and delights of this life. For all things, 1 Cor. 3.
22, 23. (...). Antisth. and Zeno apud Laert. Vnus est sapiens, cujus oi^a sunt.
Sen. de benef. l. 7. c. 3. (...). Post Diogenem Clemens Alex. in protrept.
says the Apostle, as well things present, as things to come, and even this
world too, (and such honest joys and delights consequently as it is able to
afford) are yours, because you are Christ's, who is Hebr. 1. 2.
the heir of all things, and Apoc. 21. 7.
you in him, being Romans 8. 17.
coheires with him; and he Gods. Though his joy depend not upon them, as the
worldly man's does, yet 1 Cor. 7. 30, 31. Deuteronomy. 12. 21, 22. and 14. 23, 26. Neh.
8. 10, 11, 12. Zech. 3. 10.
he is not debarred of them, and of the free and comfortable use of them: which
Genesis 30. 27, 30. and 39. 5. Deus multa malis tribuit. Sed ea bonis paraverat.
Contingunt autem and malis, quia separari non possunt. No^ possent certis
contingere, nisi and caet^ris donarentur. Sen. de benef. lib. 4. cap. 28.
for his sake many times even the wicked worldly ones have more plenty of,
than otherwise they should have had. Non sequitur, ut cui men's sapit, ei
palatum non sapiat. Cic. de fin. l. 1. Sensum enim hominis nulla exuit virtus.
Sen. ep. 85.
Nor does it follow, says the Heathen man, that a wise man's palate should find
no relish in his meat, because Job 12. 11. and 34. 3. (...). Greg. Naz. ad
Eunom.
his mind finds more relish in some other better matters: or that a
Christian man should not find Psalm. 66. 13.
much delight and comfort even in these outward things, because Psalm. 4. 7.
he has other, and better matter of joy and comfort within. He could not be so
Genesis 32. 10. and 48. 15. Deuteronomy. 32. 13, 14.
heartily thankful to God for them, if he found not much comfort, delight,
relief and refreshing in them. Yea (...). Plut. de virt. and vit.
no man may eat his meat with more delight, or use his honest recreations and
disports with more comfort, or have more joy of his worldly wealth and estate,
than the godly man may: worldly men have these things but as thieves stolen
goods, that they make merry with in hugger mugger; or as a man that has robbed
the Kings Exchequer, and by that means enriched himself. Whereas the godly
man has them Genes. 32. 10. Psalm. 65. 9, 10, 11, 12. Zech. 9. 17.
as favors bestowed on him by God, as effects and fruits of his love, which
makes them the more comfortable by much to him, and does exceedingly improve
his joy and delight in them: since Non tam dono leta est, quam abs te datum;
(non tam munere quam abs te missum;) idve to triumphat serio. Ter. Eun. 3. 11.
At illa quanto gratiora sunt, quantoque in partem interiore^ animi nunqua^
exitura descendunt, cum delectant cogitantem magis a quo, quam quid acceperis.
Sen. de ben. l. 1. c. 15.
it is the Giver often that ioyeth a man more than the gift: and a small matter
bestowed on a man out of grace and favor by his Sovereign, does more rejoice
him, than a far greater gotten from him by stealth. And as for such filthy
and beastly delights, such inordinate and brutish lusts, as Non est vera
jucunditas quae secundum seculu^ jucunditas est. Aug. in Psalm. 96. Virg. cum
mala mentis Gaudia dixit, improprie locutus, significavit homines suo malo
laetos. Sen. ep. 59.
have indeed no sound pleasure in them, no more than is found in the scratching
of some unsound or euil-affected part when it it cheth; and Dimitte istas
voluptates turbidas, magno luendas: non venturae tantum, sed praeteritae
nocent. Quemadmoau^ scelera etiam si non sint deprehensa cum fierent,

bring much more pain with them commonly at parting, or if not then presently,
not long after: howsoever he may have formerly taken some delight in them, as
worldly men ordinarily do: yet being healed now of his disease, it is no pain
for him to part with them, At non est voluptatum tanta quasi titillatio in
senibus. Credo, sed ne desideratio quidem. Nihil autem molestu^, quod non
desideres. Cupidis fortasse rerum talium ediosum and molestu^ est carere:

An tu mala^ optares scabie^, quia scabendi aliqua est voluptas? Erasm. in
colloq.
he desires not the itch, that he may be scratching again; no more than
Saul, when 1 Samuel 10. 9.
a new heart was given him, had a mind to be following his Fathers Asses
again. He is no more troubled with the leaving and forbearing of them, than 1
Cor. 13. 11. (...). Clem. Alex. in protrept. ^ sub nutrice puella cum luderet
infans, Quod cupide petiit, mature plena reliquit. Horat. ep. 1. lib. 2.
men grown are wont to be troubled, when they are come to maturitie and
ripeness of years, that they may not now play at chery-pit, as they had wont
to do when they were children; or that they must lay aside and leave off such
childish toys, as sometime they made much reckoning of: or than men glorified
in heaven after the resurrection shall be grieved, that they do Luke 20. 34,
35.
not eat and drink, and marry, and make merry still in that manner as they
did, while they lived here on earth. These and the like vanities godliness
indeed waineth men, and estrangeth their minds from, and Vanas voluptates,

furnishes them with other joys and delight, such as do so far surpass
all outward joys whatsoever, as there is indeed Homo erat, qui improbos
gaudere negabat: norat gaudia calicis, mensae, lecti, etc. sed tale gaudium
videbat, in cujus comparatione iliud gaudium non erat. Ac si tu nosses Solemn,
and alij laudanti lucernam diceres, Non est lux ista. Aug. in Psalm. 96. Quae
sunt epidaru^, aut ludorum, scortorumve voluptates cum his voluptatibus
comparandae? Cic. de senect. Nemo sanae mentis ampliorem credat esse in vitijs
quam in virtutibus delectatione^. Bern. de bon. deser.
no comparison between the one and the other: the one is as no joy in regard
of the other. For what is the kingdom of Christ? nothing but dumps and doubts,
and drooping, and melancholy fits, as many imagine. Or what is the work of
Gods Spirit in the hearts of his children? To possess their souls wholly with
terrors and fears; or to fill them with grief and pensiveness only? No,
Galat. 5. 22.
The fruit of the Spirit is joy and peace, says the Apostle. And, Romans 14. 17.
the Kingdom of God is Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.
There is true joy, there is sound joy, there is unutterable joy; ( 1 Pet. 1. 8.
(...).
You rejoice with a joy glorious, says the Apostle Peter, and unspeakable;
And, 2 Cor. 7. 4. (...).
I do ouer-abound exceedingly in joy, says S. Paul; as finding no words
sufficient to express his joy with:) such joy, as Illud verum and solum est
gaudium, quod non de terra, sed de coelo est, quod non de creatura, sed de
Creatore co^cipitur. Cui comparata omnis aliunde jucunditas moeror est, omnis
suavitas dolor est, omne dulce amarum, decorum omne foedum, omne aliud
quodcunque delect^re possit, molestum. Bern. epist. 114.
no worldly joy is once to be compared with; such joy, Apoc. 2. 17. Ego neminem
arbitror posse vel scire quid sit, nisi qui acceperit. Bern. in Cant. 3. Melius
impressum quam expressum innot^scit. Ibid 9.
as no worldly man is able to conceive what it is. Prove. 14. 10.
The soul only, says Solomon, knows it own bitterness; nor does another
feel its joy. And, Mel si non noffes, quam been saperet, nisi gustares non
scires. Lauda verbis quantum potes, qui non gustaverit, non intelliget. Aug. in
Psalm. 30. and 51. Cyrill. ad Joan. l. 4. c. 38. and Greg. in Euang. 36.
Talk, says Augustine, as long as you will, and all you can, of Honey, and of
the sweetness of it, unless a man taste it, he can never conceive what it is.
So undoubtedly it is here: I^ his non capit intelligentia, nisi quantum
attingit experientia. Bern. in Cant. 22. Expertus novit; inexpertus ignorant.
Idem de diverse. 19.
He alone that has tasted it, Use 2.
can tell, Exhortation.
what sweet peace and tranquillity of heart and mind, Branch 1.
what unspeakable joy and comfort of spirit is there found and felt, where the
mercy of God in Jesus Christ is once soundly assured and sealed up to the
soul.

Secondly, this may serve for Exhortation, and incitement to Godliness, and to
godly joy; to labor for it, and to joy in it.

First, to incite men to labor for righteousness, if they desire to attain
to true and hearty rejoicing. Would thou have joy? ( Nemo est qui non
gaudere velit. Bern. de diverse. 19.
Who would not? For Nemo est qui non beatus esse velit. Aug. ep. 121. and de
Trinit. lib. 13. cap. 3. Vivere omnes beat volunt. Sen. de beat. cap. 1.
all men desire happiness: and Beata quippe vitae est gaudere veritate. Aug.
confess. l. 10. c. 23.
as there is no full happiness without joy; so there is no sound joy without
true happiness.) then Disce gaudere. Se^. ep. 23. Hujus fundamentum quod sit,
queris? ne gaudeas vanis. Fundamentu^ esse dixi? culmen est. Ad summa pervenit,
qui scit quo gaudeat. Ibid.
learn here the right way to it: then take that course that will bring thee to
true joy and sound peace. Matthew. 6. 32.
Seek the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof. It is the righteous
man only that can truly rejoice. For Romans 14. 17.
the kingdom of God is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
There is Gaudium in fine; sed gaudium sine fine. Bern. de diverse. 19.
joy in the end, says Bernard, and joy without end: but Est gaudium de regno
Dei, sed non est primum in regno Dei: de justitia and pace gaudium procedit.
Ibid. 18. Laetitia merces; justitia meritum and materia est. Idem de temp. 30.
the way to this joy is by righteousness and peace. From righteousness peace
flows, and joy from peace. The one is Ipsa est via per quam ad pacem
proceditur, ad laetitiam pervenitur. Idem de temp. 30. Quid viam
praetergredimini, qui ad gaudium properatis? Idem de diverse. 18. Quid
praecipiti saltu justitiam transilientes and pacem, rem finalem in principium
convertere and pervertere vultis. Ibid. 19.
the way, the other is the end; and unless we go the way, we can never come
to the end.

It is true indeed, if there were Eundem cursu diverso porium petas.
diverse ways that tended to one end, it were no great matter, which of them a
man took: though he should go further about, it may be, and take somewhat
the more pains, yet he were sure at the last to arrive where he would. But
when a man has tried all other courses, he shall find in conclusion, that
there is Gaudium hoc non nascitur nisi ex virtutum conscientia. Sen. ep. 59.
no other way but this to attain to true joy, and that all his labor
therefore was lost in beating about and seeking by other courses to compass
it. It was Salomons own case. And Eccles. 2. 12.
who can hope after him to discover some new passage that he could not?
Eccles. 1. 16. 1 King. 3. 12.
He was the wisest man that ever was: 1 King. 3. 13. Eccles. 2. 1-11.
nor wanted he abundance of all such things as worldly men are wont to take
delight in, and make the matter of their joy. But when Eccles. 1. 13, 17. and
2. 1, 2, etc.
he had wearied himself in a multiplicitie of by-waies, treading one while in
one path, and traveling another while another, and Eccles. 7. 7, 9. ^
pursuing each as far as any of them would lead, at length he concludes
that there was no true joy, comfort and contentment to be found in any thing

any state or condition, be it never so mean, or, in the eye of the world,
never so miserable: whereas the greatest, highest, largest, gloriousest estates
cannot give any dram or drop of pure joy, sure comfort, or true content
without it. Any course of life may be cheerful and lightsome with it; none can
ever be truly comfortable or delightful without it. Godliness (...). Plut.

Secondly, Branch 2.
to incite all those that have attained to this estate, to joy in it: and not
to suffer outward losses, worldly crosses, calamities or the like, to deprive
and bereave them of that alacrity and cheerfulness that their estate may
well afford them; and that the holy Ghost, as we heard before, does so often
require of them, even so Ps. 2. 11. and 32. 11. and 33. 1. and 97. 12. and 68.

men to rejoice so as they ought, and as they have just cause to do. It is a
point that is far more easily preached than practiced. Yet this should we
every one of us strive and strain our selves unto; and to this purpose 2 Petr.
1. 10.
Give, as the Apostle advises, all diligent endeavor to get assurance to our
selves of our election and of our calling and conversion unto God; since that

upon our notice and apprehension of it, does this our joyful and comfortable
estate for the present depend; and for want of it, many that have much cause of
joy and comfort, were they but aware of it, live often times a very heavy and
uncomfortable life; and so are, through their own ignorance and default, many
times most miserable, when yet they are indeed, or at least might be most
happy. And when we find our selves so depressed and dejected, by means of
cross occurrents, that this alacrity and cheerfulness is overwhelmed
therewith, labor to rouse up our spirits, and say, as David sometime said;
Psalm. 42. 5, 11. and 43. 5.
Why art thou thus dejected and cast down, O my Soul? and why art thou so
distracted and disquieted within me? Trust still in God, and fix thy hopes on
him, who is the light of thy Countenance, and thy God. Yea do as David did,
endeavor at least to do it: when he was in a great streit, his City sacked
and burned, his own wives, and the wives and children of his followers carried
captive; and for ought he or they then knew, all slain; his own company also
conspiring to stone him to death; so transported they were with grief and
passion, each one for his own losses; yet amids all these difficulties it is
said of David, that 1 Samuel 10. 6.
He cheered up himself in the Lord his God. And so should every one do, that
truly and sincerely fears God, and is careful to walk in the obedience of
his will; though he sit in darkness, says the Prophet, and have no spark of
light, that his outward estate is able to afford, yet Esai. 50. 10.
Let him trust in the Lord, and rest him on his God; and even then also
endeavor Psalm. 13. 5. (...). Greg. Naz. ad civ. pericht.
to be glad, Motives 4.
and rejoice in his favor and mercy, when his present estate seems to give
all cause to the contrary.

This the rather Gods Children should strive and strain themselves unto; as to
attain, so at all times to retain and maintain this alacrity and
cheerfulness in their souls:

First, Motive 1.
because the want of it is a great enemy to thankfulness. Psalm. 33. 1.
Rejoice in the Lord ye righteous, says the Psalmist; for it becomes the
upright to be thankful: as if they could not be thankful, unless they were
Beneficia hilares accipiamus, gaudi^^ profitentes: and id danti manifestu^ sit,
ut praesentem fructum capiat. Iusta enim causa letitiae est amicu^ lat^^
videre, justior fecisse. Sen. de be^. l. 2. c. 22. Gratias agere, gaudentis
est. Ibid. l. 3. c. 3.
cheerful. And certainly we cannot be so thankful to God as we should for
his favors, so long as we have no joy of them, as we take not delight in
them. Yea we are too too Ingrati grati^: uti saepe Augustine.
unthankful to the grace of God, Motive 2.
and value his goodness at too low a rate, if we suffer any outward thing,
what ever it be, and much more toys and trifles, matters of no moment, to
deprive us of the joy that we might and should enjoy in it.

Secondly, because the want of it is a great hinderance unto the performance of
good duties. Psalm. 2. 11.
Serve the Lord with fear, says the Psalmist, and rejoice before him with
reverence, And when thou come to appear before the Lord thy God in thy
festiuals, Deuteronomy. 16. 11, 14. 15.
See in any case, says God, that thou rejoice. And, Deuteronomy. 28. 47, 48.
Because thou would not serve the Lord thy God, with ioyfulnesse and with
gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things: therefore shall thou serve
thine enemies that he shall send upon thee, in hunger, and thirst, and
nakedness, and in want of all things. It is as 2 Cor. 9. 7. Romans 12. 8. Qui cu^
tristitia manum porrigit, remunerationis fructum amittit. Pulchre and eleganter
in colorando beneficio candor jucunditatis laudatus est voce illa poetica,
(Ovid. Met.) ante (...) v^ltus Accessere (...). Bern. in Cant. 71.
a cheerful giver, so Tertius obedientiae gradus, hilariter obedire, ut
voluntati cordis, simplicitati operis, vultus (...) adjungas. Idem de grad.
obed.
a cheerful seruer, that God loves and delights in. And Mu^tum col^rat
obedi^ntiam obseq^entis, vultus s^renitas. Quis imperet lib^mer tristitiam
efflanti? Bern. ibid. Quicquid focis, cu^ ^ilari^ate fac: bonum tunt been
facis. Sin autem cum tristitia facis, fit de te, non ipse facis. Aug. in Psalm.
91.
it takes away the grace of all holy duties, Motive 3.
when with hanging of the wings, and flagging affections, when with drooping,
lumpishnesse, deadness and dullness we go about them.

Thirdly, because it heartneth Gods enemies, and gives them occasion of
triumph, when they see Gods children hang the head. Then Psalm. 13. 2.
do David's enemies exult over him, when they see him smitten with sorrow, and
like one at his wits end. It is not so much the crosses and calamities that
befall Gods Church and children, as Fructus contumeliae in sensu and
indignatione patientis est. Sen. de constant. sap. c. 17.
their taking them too much to heart, and their heartlesse carriage under them,
that heartneth and encourages the adverse party, and gives them occasion to
triumph. As (...). Romans 8. 37. (...). 2 Cor. 2. 14. and 4. 8, 9. Genus ultionis
est, eripere ei qui fecit, contumeliae voluptatem. Sen. de constable. sap. c. 17.
we triumph over them, though they seem to prevail against us, when we show
our selves undaunted and vndismaid, notwithstanding their extremest rage, and
Nempeidcirco aliquis te laedit ut doleas; quia fructus omnis laedentis in
dolor lesi est. Ergo cum fructum ejus everteris non dolendo, ipse doleat
necesse est amissione fructus sui. Tertull. de patient. c. 8.
nothing vexes them more, than when they perceive that notwithstanding all
that ever they can do, yet our courage is not quailed: So on the other side
again it puts courage into them, when they perceive us to be discouraged,
it ministers matter of joy and insultation to them, when they see us dejected
and disheartened, and our countenances cast down, as if we despaired wholly of
divine, either protection or deliverance, and were not only at our wits end,
but at our hopes end also.

And lastly, Motive 4.
because it disheartneth many from good courses. As Number. 13. 31.
the Spies that were sent to view the Land of Canaan, by their cowardice and
faint-heartednesse, brought up a slander upon that good Land that God had
promised to bestow upon his people, and so Number. 14. 1-4.
made the people that they had no desire to set further forward toward it, but
began to entertain thoughts rather of returning back again into Egypt: So
this heavy and uncomfortable state and carriage of Gods children, causes
religion and godliness to be misdoubted and traduced, as a most heartlesse and
uncomfortable course; is a means to bring an imputation upon the good ways of
God, as if nothing but melancholy fits were there to be found, and that sullen
humor were the only predominant in all pious and religious persons; and so
beats back many from setting foot into good courses, that were coming on
before; yea makes many call in question, and doubt shrewdly of the truth of
those things that the Spirit of God speaks so Psalm. 4. 6, 7. and 68. 4, 5.
and 89. 15, 16, 17. and 118. 15. Prove. 29. 6. Ro^. 5. 2, 3.
often in the Word, Conclusion.
concerning the joy and comfort of the godly man's estate.

All which well considered, it stands us every one in hand, that are
attained to the state of grace and favor with God, as we desire to show our
selves truly and thoroughly thankful to God for it, and to express our
thankfulness in such a cheerful performance of good duties, as may put life
and grace into them, as we would be loath to hearten Gods enemies, and add
courage unto them, or to dishearten weak ones, and discourage them from
coming on to him; to take notice of our own happiness, and consider well what
a blessed estate we are in, and to stir up our hearts to a ioying in it, in
some measure, proportionably to that matter of joy that it ministers unto us;
and to take great heed how we suffer this joy either to be filched from us by
any slight of Satan, or to be drowned in us by occasion of any outward
occurrents.

And here before we pass from this first Point of Instruction, it shall not be
amiss, to remove that imputation that we even now said is by occasion of the
uncomfortable carriage of some Christians, cast by many upon the Profession of
Christianity in general; by answering an Objection that may be and is often
made against the Doctrine before delivered.

For, Objection.
Joy the godly man's Portion? may some man say. Experience plainly disproueth
it. We see none live more merrily and iouially than wicked and worldly men do;
none more heavily and pensiuely than those that make most conscience of their
courses: so that none, it seems have indeed less joy than the godly.

Branches 2.
I answer to either Branch severally.

First for the wicked and worldly, Branch 1.
such they say, Job 21. 7, 12, 13.
live most merrily, Psalm. 73. 4, 5, 7.
and rejoice most of Esai. 5. 11, 12.
any. Amos 6. 4, 5, 6.


But 1. Answer 1.
They judge amiss of Joy, and are much mistaken, that Tu illum judicas
gaudere, qui ridet? Aninus debet esse ^lacer, etc. Sen. ep. 23.
measure joy by outward laughter, and merriment. A sound substantial joy is
one thing, and a tickling laughter is another thing: There is a pain sometime
in the one, an inward warmth in the other. Itaque recte Cit. de Orat. l. 2.
Ingenij fructus tenuissimus est risus. Et ibid. Locus and regio quasi ridiculi
turpitudine and deformitate quadam continetur. Vide and Quintil. instit. l. 6.
c. 3.
Any ridiculous toy may occasion the one, some weighty matter is necessarily
the ground of the other. Whether delights a man more, or ioyeth him more
inwardly at the heart, a bag of gold given him, or an inheritance befallen him,
that it may be, he scarce smileth at the receipt of, o^ some idle jest told him
that makes him laugh till his heart ache, or till he almost burst again
withal? Res severa est verum gaudium. Sen. ep. 23.
True joy, says the Heathen man, is, though not a sad, yet a solid and a
serious thing. And there is as much difference between idle merriment and
sound joy, as between wanton daliance and well grounded love. Wicked and
worldly men may have some kind of Caetera hilaritates leves sunt; frontem
remittunt, pectus non implent. Ibid.
superficial merriment, some kind of froathie and flashie mirth, such as may
(...). Homer. Iliad. (...)
wet the mouth, but not warm the heart, may smooth the brow, but not fill the
breast; like Hac quibus delectatur vulgus, tenuem quandam habent ac perfusoriam
voluptatem. Sen. ib. i. leviter aspergentem, non and penetrantem. Lips.
a slight dash of rain, that washes the stalk, but wetteth not the root,
and therefore does the grass little good; or to use Salomons comparison,
Stolidi risus, spinarum sub olla crepitus. Eccles. 7. 6. Ecquando ne vidisti

materia levi, caduco incendio, nullis reliqurijs. Apul. in apolog. L^titiae
secularis (...) aptissima.
like an handful of brush wood or sear thorns under the pot, that makes a
great noise, and gives a great blase, but heateth little, boileth nothing,
leaves the meat still as Psalm. 58. 9. Tractuma semicrudis carnibus olla

raw as it was when it went in: But true, sound and substantial joy, such as
that is that the godly have, (as is here said to belong to them) do such never
attain to.

We see what they make show of outwardly, but we see not what they feel
inwardly. Prove. 14. 10.

Perpetua anxietas nec mensae tempore cessat. Iuvenal. sat. 13.
You see how such feast and riot outwardly; but you consider not what gripes

than a light gigling, many times, but a strained grinning, Sardonius hic risus
est: mordet eos interim interius co^scientiae vermis cauterijs omnibus acrior.
Calvin. institut. l. 1. c. 3.
like the laughter of such as have eaten of mad Smallage, which though it
wring them exceedingly inwardly, yet sets them on grinning outwardly, and so
makes them go away with a seeming laughter. Prove. 29. 6.
In the transgression of the wicked there is a snare, says Solomon: And, Prove.
5. 22.
the wicked man is holden in the cords of his own sin. Every wicked man
carries an halter about him to strangle his own joy withal, to mar his own
mirth. The guilt of his sin is as (...). Plut. de tranquil. Vulnus alit

Safe they may be, says the Heathen man, but they are never secure. And,
Secure, say I, they may sometime be, but they can never be safe. As the Peace
they have, is but a seeming peace: so the joy they have is but a counterfeit
joy; no true peace, no sound, no substantial joy.

Secondly, Branch 2.
for the godly, do they seem many times very Psalm. 6. 2, 3, 6, 7. and 13. 2.
and 42. 3, 4, 6, 7. and 73. 13.
pensive and sorrowful? and the life of many such to be very uncouth and
uncomfortable?

I answer: 1. Answer 1.
Those that object this, as Bernard speaks, do but Festuca^ quaerunt, unde
oculum sibi eruant. Ben. de bon. deser.
seek for a straw to thrust out their own eyes with. For do they see and
observe many such, as they say, that live uncouth and uncomfortable lives? They
might as well on the other side, if they pleased, see and observe many more
that have lived wonderful cheerfully 2 Cor. 6. 10. and 7. 4. Phil. 4. 11, 12,
13. (...) Plut. de v^rt. and vit.
even in extreme want and penury, in so much that their whole life, for the
cheerfulness of it, has been as Prove. 15. 15. (...) Diogenes. (...) Plut.
de tranquil.
a continual feast; that have carried themselves most comfortably amids many
grievous calamities, that a man would wonder how they could stand upright, or
hold up the head under the weight of them, so as they have done. Romans 5. 3. Non
e malis solum liberaberis, sed ^mum bibes ex eis, ubi ceperis, in his etiam
gloriari. Bern. de diverse. 18.
Not so only (says the Apostle, having spoken of Christian men's rejoicing in
their hope of glory;) but we glory also even in our afflictions. And the
faithful Hebrews, Hebr. 10. 34.
with much joy suffered the loss of their goods. And the Apostles Act. 5. 40,
41. Tribulatio pro salatio, contumelia pro gloria, inopia pro abundantia est.
Bern. prav. sermon. 63. Quomodo idem de Socrate, ep. 57.
went from the Consistory when they had been beaten, rated and reviled,
rejoicing that they were graced so to be disgraced for Christ. And Many a
Martyr of Christ has gone (...). Gr. Naz. in Julian. 2. (...). Idem de Pasch.
as merrily to the stake, as others would have done to a feast. Now these men
see and observe the one, but the other they will not see, because they are
willing to pick a quarrel to Christian profession. To use a Comparison, used
before me by Dr Burgess on Act. 9. 31.
a right reverend Divine. Suppose a man come into one of your shops, and ask
to see some wares: which when he is showed, he finds some fault with; and
though you tell him you will show him better, yet he refuses to see them, and
so goes his way: will you not say that such a one came not to buy, but to
cavil? In like manner, when men to object against piety and godliness, as the
mother and means of a most uncomfortable life, shall pick out examples of
some few distressed and disconsolate Christians, that either oppressed with
melancholy, or Bona non sua nerunt.-Virg. Georg. l. 2.
mistaken through weakness of judgment in their own estates, live pensiuely,
and shall rehuse to take notice of others many more, ten to one, that live
cheerfully, and go on joyfully with much comfort and contentment in a
religious course of life; we may well say and deem of such, that they deal
very unequally, and are bent to cavil only at the practice and profession of
piety, because Volentes ea vituperant, sibi quae no^ placent.
they have no love or liking to it.

2. Answer 2.
Are good men, say thou, many times heavy and sad? It is not godliness or
holiness that makes them so heavy, but the want of it rather, either in
others or in themselves.

And not to insist long upon the former, that the godly are often heavy, not
because they are themselves holy, but because others, Act. 26. 29.
whom they desire should be so, Romans 9. 2, 3.
are not as themselves are. It is not their own holiness, but thy
profaneness that makes them heavy. As 2 Pet. 2. 8.
the bad lives of the Sodomites were an heart-sore to Lot, and Psalm. 119. 136,
158.
the wicked courses of David's enemies, a great grief unto David. Sicut, Malus
bonum esse vult malum, ut sit sui similis. Plaut. Trimum. 2. 2. Ita bonus bonum.
Nor were a man indeed truly good, did he not desire to have others also good;
Magnus bonorum labor est mores tolerare contrarios, quibus qui non offenditur,
parum proficit. Tantum enim torquet justum alieni peccati iniquitas, quantum a
sua recedit. Aug. in sent. Prosper. 122. Itaque site ac vere Martin. Dum. de
morib. Qui aequo animo malis immise^tur, malus est.
nor can he be desirous that others should do well, but he must needs be
grieved when he shall see them do otherwise than well. They are one maine
cause of their heaviness, that find fault with them for it. They should have
the less cause to be heavy, and it were not for such as they are.

But to let that pass, it is not so much the light of their present, as the
consideration of their former estate that makes good men so sad. They are not
heavy, because they are now holy, but Neminem pudet, nemimem poenitet, nisi
quod plane retro non fuerit. Tertull. apolog.
because they were not sooner such: that they have spent, or misspent rather
so much time, in an unholy course of life, which now seeing their own folly,
they seriously repent of, and are sincerely sorry for. Or if their grief
arise, as it may well also, from the sight of the present; it is because they
are no holier than they are. Greenham alicubi.
The godly, says one, are not heavy therefore, because they are holy; but
therefore are they heavy, because they are no more holy; because they are not
so holy yet as they would be: because they see so much (...). Greg. Naz de
Sasim. Ep sc.
unholiness yet abide by them. As Eccles. 5. 10.
the love of money makes men think that they have never enough of it; and the
greedy desire of having still more, makes them not regard or take notice of
what already they have. You shall hear the rich often complain that they are
(...). Chrysostom. in 1 Cor. hom. 14. Confessio est paupertatis augendi
cupiditas. Omnis enem cupido acquirendi ex opinione inopiae venit. Apul. in
apolog.
but very poor men; and they are indeed in some respect as they say. So the
great love of godliness, and the greedy desire of it, and that even out of
the comfort and sweetness that they have felt and found in it, does often so
possess the hearts and minds of the godly, that it withholdeth them from
seeing and taking notice of what they have, and makes them many times pensive,
because they have so little Quid enim refert quam magnum sit, quod tibi minus
est. Apul. ibid.
as they imagine, though being more than ordinarily stored with it, of that
which so earnestly they desire. Nor ought that heaviness of theirs therefore
be imputed to be holiness, which either the true or supposed want of it
produces. It is a very unequal thing, to charge holiness with that that
unholiness is the cause of, and much more to challenge the godly for that,
which themselves and such as they be, are the cause of.

3. Answer. 3.
Do some godly men lead a very uncomfortable life? It is by means of their
weakness and ignorance of their own happiness. Foelicitatem ipsi suam no
intelligunt. Sen. de benef. lib. 2. cap. 27.
They judge not aright of their own present estate; they are not yet
acquainted with the voice of Gods Spirit, that speaks peace and comfort to
their souls. As when men come at first into a strange country, it is some
space of time ere they can understand Psalm. 85. 8.
the language, and so come to converse familiarly with the Natives thereof. So
is it with Gods Children often for some space of time, after their first
conversion to God and godliness, they understand not instantly the language of
Gods Spirit, which they have not been formerly acquainted with; nor apprehend
they therefore presently those sweet comforts and joys that their present
estate and condition affords. It is with them as with a prisoner or a
condemned person, that though he have his pardon signed and sealed, and news
brought him of it, as Genesis 45. 26.
Jacob had of Joseph's life and state, yet does not believe it; or when the deed
it self is showed to him, yet because he cannot himself read it, or see his
own name in it, or else because, it may be, he mistaketh somewhat in it,
gives no credit at all to it, and so has no more joy of it yet, than as if it
were not. And we may add also, that even melancholy is many times a cause of
it. For Gods grace, though it renew and change the disposition of the soul,
yet it alters not the natural constitution of the body. Even the godly
therefore, as they are some of them made of a melancholic mould as well as
others, so are they (...). Act. 14. 15. Iam. 5. 17.
subject, as well as others, to melancholic passions and affections? An humor
that is wont to raise many strange imaginations, groundless griefs, false
fears and frights, senseless surmises; and as Per vitru^ viride visa viridia
videatur. Cardan. de subtle. l. 7.
a piece of colored glass makes all that is seen through it, yea the very
Tinguntur ab eis in quorum oram subeundo venerunt. Plin. hist. not. l. 2. c. 18.
Sunnebeames, that pass in by it, seem all of the same color with it self;
so this black humor represents all things to the eye of the soul Vti de
slava bile Varro in Eumenid. Arquatis lutea videntur, etiam quae non sunt
lutea. Nonius de propr. sermon. l. 1.
as duskish and dark, full of horror and terror, even the very bright beams
of Gods favor, and the lovely fruits and effects of it, picking many times
matter of fear and misdoubt out of those things, that might give it best
assurance. That which See Bright of Melanchol. chap. 17. and 34. and 35.
the Devil also taking advantage of, is not negligent to work upon, and by
means thereof, to possess the minds of such, with such conceits of
themselves, which by reason of their melancholy, having once made a deep
impression, are not easily again removed, as may vex and turmoile them, and
either make them weary of Gods ways, or discourage others from entering into
them. And it is unequal to ascribe that unto godliness in general, that
proceeds from the Quomodo Cicer. de senect. Non est proprium hoc senectutis
vitium, sed commune valetudinis.
special constitution of some few godly ones only, and is no other than is
common to them, with many other profane also, being of the same constitution,
though not in the same condition, that they are. We see, scholars many, more
than others ordinarily, subject to melancholy, because their retired courses of
life and priuacie of study, is a great means to feed that humor where it is
naturally found: yet neither follows it therefore, that all Scholars live
uncomfortable lives, because some do so, that are possessed and oppressed with
that humor. Nor may that rightly be ascribed to study and learning, which not
it, but the constitution of some students produces.

4. Answer 4.
Do men live sometime not so comfortably, when they begin to grow godly? The
untowardness of their corrupt nature is the cause of it. It is no marvel if
the spiritual breeding be with some difficulty: especially when we go, as
Genesis 25. 22, 23.
Rebekkah did, with two twins, and those such too as cannot agree well
together. No marvel, I say, if there be some Galat. 5. 17. Romans 7. 23.
striving and struggling, and such as may sometime cause much inward trouble and
distraction, until the better of them have got the upper hand of the other.
(...). Pythagoricum monitum. Plut. de fuga. and de sanit. Verum (...) magis,
uti idem de tranquil. Hinc Antonini Imper. monitum vitae suae l. 12. (...).
Make choice of the best course of life, said the Heathen man sometime, and use
and custom will make it familiar and pleasant. But as it is with milstones,
though they be hewed as fit as may be either to other, yet they grind not at
first so handsomely, till they have wrought sometime together: Or apparel,
though well made, and fit for the body, yet is not so easy at the first
putting on, as when it has been worn a while: Nor do man and wife many
times, especially having some cross qualities, agree so well at first as they
do afterward, when they come to understand more thoroughly either others
disposition, and have learned to fashion and apply themselves either to other.
So it is here: (...) Matthew. 11. 29. Grave dum tollis, suave cum tuleris. Greg.
in Ezech. l. 2. hom. 7. Quam male inassueti veniunt ad aratra juv^enci?
Christ's yoke, says Gregory, seems heavy at the first taking of it up; it
becomes easy, yea delightful, when a while we have borne it. Gods Spirit
and our corrupt nature do not fadge so well at first: they seem somewhat
uncouth courses that we are entered into, till we have inured our selves unto
them. It is our own Hosh. 10. 11.
untowardness, and unruliness, our Hosh. 13. 13.
sticking at the birth, our unwillingness to yield our selves up wholly unto
God, Romans 8. 7.
the rebelliousnesse of our spirit not reduced so easily to the obedience of
Gods good Spirit, that hinders our comfort, that procures to us that
discomfort, which more godliness admitted and given way to would cure. Sublata
causa, tollitur effectus.
For the cause taken away, the effect would soon cease.

5. Answer 5.
Are even godly men sometime in very lamentable plight? Their own wickedness,
their own wantonness, not their weakness only, is sometime the cause of it.
For even Psalm. 119. 176.
Gods children also oft-times straying out of Gods way, as we are wont to say
of children, light into harms way, and come home again by weeping cross.
Even Gods children are now and then shaking hands with the wicked, and taking
part with Gods enemies, as 2 Chronicles. 18. 1, 3, 31. and 19. 2.
Iosaphat with Ahab, which they pay full dear for oftentimes before they have
done with it: yea as our children, so Deuteronomy. 32. 15.
Gods children, when they are full fed especially, are ouer-prone to grow
wanton, and will needs be dipping their finger sometime in the Devils sauce, as
I may so say; as children sometime out of a lickerish disposition, will be
tampering with such things, Negatis animus in^iat avidsus. Bern, in Cant. 67.
Audax omnia perpeti Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas. Horat. carm. 1. 3.
Nitimur in vetitu^ semp^r, cupimusque negatum. Quod non licet, acrius urit,
Ovid (...). 2. 19.
as they are forbidden to meddle with, and it is dangerous for them to deal
with; which costeth them afterward many a deep sigh and a salt tear, ere they
can recover again of the evil, and the inward discomfort, that by means
thereof accrueth unto them. It was David's case: Psalm. 30. 6, 7.
when he was now at rest and ease, 2 Samuel 11. 2, 3, 4.
he was led aside, and fell a dalying with some sinful delights, that Psalm.
32. 3, 4.
eclipsed his joy and comfort, and procured to him such discomfort, as made his
life for a long time together most uncomfortable to him, Psalm. 51. 8, 12.
it being a long time ere he could thoroughly recover his former state of joy
and comfort again. But what is the true cause of discomfort in such cases? It
is not godliness; it is Causa tristitiae peccatum est: causa laetitiae
justitia est. Aug. in Psalm. 42.
ungodliness. Crudelem medicu^ intemperans aeger facit. P. Sir.
A disordered patient, we say, makes a cruel Physician. The patients
disorder and misdieting of himself, contrary to the rules by the Physician
prescribed him, procures him often much pain, disturbeth the cure of his
disease, hinders his recovery, requires new purgings and potions, yea
peradventure ^earings and cuttings, that otherwise he should not have needed;
which (...). Greg. Naz. ad cives periclitant.
to lay the fault of, therefore, on the Physician, or the rules of Physic, or
the courses by him prescribed, and of the patient neglected, were unreasonable
and senseless.

6 Answer 6.
Are the godly in these cases full of sorrow and grief? Even in such sorrow
and sadness there is the (...). Basil. Caes. hom. 4.
seed of sound joy. Matthew. 5. 4. (...). Chrysostom. in Philip. hom. 14.
The way to joy is by grief; as the way by Physic is to health. As the
worldly man's Pro. 14. 13. (...). Antipho. Apes pungunt, quia ubicunq dulce est,
ibi and acidum teperies. Petron. Satyr.
joy ends in grief; so the godly man's Esai. 61. 3. Matthew. 5. 4.
grief ends in joy. Greenha^ observe.
He is not far from true joy, that can sincerely sorrow for his sin. For as
Bellu^ contra diabolum pacem patrat ad Deum. Origin. ad Romans 5. Nisi
discordaveris cu^ diabolo, pacem non habebis cum Christo. Aug. quest. N. T. 92.
Itaque vere Greg. Naz. de pace 1. (...). Et in apolog. (...).
war with the world procures peace with God; so 2. Cor. 7. 9, 10, 11. (...).
Chrysostom. in Phil. hom. 15.
sorrow for sin produces joy in God. Yea he has much matter of sound joy in
him, as we shall afterward see, that can and does seriously lament and bewail
his own wants, his untowardness, his former wantonness, his wickedness.
What say I, there is matter of joy? There is even joy often herein. There are
Genesis 43. 30. and 45. 2. and 46. 29, 30. Communis lachryma est and moerori and
gaudio. Non solus dolor lachrymas habet; habet and laetitia lachrymas suas.

pleasure and delight sometime even in mourning and bemoaning themselves, as
well as in mirth. And I make no doubt, but that many of Gods children do many
times take as much (...). Chrysostom. (...) 14.
delight, and find as much comfort, even in their godly grief, and in the
bewailing of their wants, as any worldly men do ordinarily in those outward
pleasures, that their hearts and affections are most carried away with. Nor let
any natural man much marvel hereat. For if such can take so much pleasure, as
I have heard some of them confess, and as Ipse dolor v^lupt^s est. Aug.
confess. l. 3. c. 2.
Augustine observes, in seeing an idle play of some fained subject, that so
affects them, that it draws tears from them, though the thing acted
nothing at all concern them, nor, it may be, ever was in truth executed, that
they desire and long exceedingly to see it again; then they need not marvel,
if Gods Children can take much more pleasure in this their holy grief, though
it draw many a tear from them, that so nearly concerns them; and in those
religious tears, which are so pleasing to God, that they cause Luke 15. 7.
much joy in heaven, and by which 2 Cor. 7. 10.
so much benefit accrueth to themselves. They may well be comfortable, that are
Matthew. 5. 4.
the procurers of comfort; they may well be pleasant and delightful tears,
that are Luke 6. 21.
sure pledges of eternal joy and delight.

7 Answer 7.
Do not the godly seem so joyful ofttimes as the wicked? or make so much
show of mirth outwardly? It follows not that therefore they are not as
joyful, or have not as much mirth as they. For the joy of Gods children, as
the ground of it, is more inward, than outward: as 1 King. 6. 4. Ezech. 40. 16.
the windows that conveyed the light into Salomons Temple, were wider within,
than without they were. Levium metallorum fructus in summo est: illa
opulentissima sunt, quoru^ in alto latet vena, assidue before responsura
f^dienti. Sen. epist. 23.
The richest veins of Oar lie deepest in the ground. And Solidu^ gaudium plus
introrsus patet. Ibid.
the greatest joy many times makes outwardly least show. As hypocrites
oft-times 2 Cor. 5. 12.
rejoice in the face, as the Apostle speaks, when yet they rejoice not in the
heart; and worldly men many times Spem vuliu simulat, premit altum cord
dolorem. Virg. Aen. l. 1. Rebus affectis hilaritatem de industria ^^^ulant, and
adversas res adumbrata laetitia abscondunt. Sen. ad Polyb. c. 24.
set a good face on it, and make semblance of mirth outwardly, when their
hearts are inwardly the whiles pincht with pain: so the godly oft-times
rejoice in the heart, when yet they rejoice not in the face; ( 2 Cor. 6. 10.
as sorrowing, says the same Apostle, and yet always rejoicing:) and have
their souls fraught inwardly with abundance of joy, though their looks
outwardly show it not. Psalm. 45. 13.
The Kings daughter, says the Psalmist, is all glorious on the inside. As the
glory of Gods Church; so the joy of Gods children is much, yea or most, inward:
and it is no marvel, therefore, if 1 John 3. 2.
the world and worldly men see not either the one or the other; they want 1
Cor. 2. 14.
spiritual eyes to discern either. They think there is no mirth, but where
there is gigling and laughing, or swaggering and reuelling, and the like. But
Gods children may say to them, as our Savior to his Disciples, John 4. 33.
I have other meat than you wot of; so, Non n^vit impius gaudium justi. Aug. in
Psalm. 137.
We have other manner of joy than you are aware of. The godly are often merry,
though they make little show of it: yea their mirth is most many times, when it
is least seen. Those that prescribe rules for the choice of Simples, advise to
take herbs in the Spring, flowers in Summer, fruits in Autumn, Vel ineunte,
vel exeunte hyeme, antequam in caulem ascendere humiditas ceperit, Cord. in
pharmacop.
roots in Winter; and why roots for the most part at that time? Surely because
the sap is then gone down; it is most in the root, when it is least in the
stock; it is most of all then underground, when it is least to be seen above
ground. And so it is oft-times with the joy of Gods children, Martyr etiam in
^atena gaudet, Gaudebat Crispina, cum tenebatur, cum audiebatur, cum
damnabatur, cum ducebatur. Aug. in Psalm. 137.
it is most rise many times with them inwardly in the heart, when least show of
it appears outwardly, or discovers it self in their life.

Lastly, Answer 8.
Is the joy of Gods children many times obscured? or does it not often so
evidently appear outwardly to the eye? It is no marvel. As we said even now,
It is here often Winter time with them. It is so in some sort generally so long
as they live here. It is Summer here with the wicked, it is Winter with them.
Psalm. 37. 2. and 92. 12. Foenea quadam foelicitate temporaliter florent. Aug.
epist. 120. c. 5. Gramen hyeme viret, aestate arescit: arbor arescente gramine
virescit. Idem in Psalm. 36.
The one is as the grass that is green in Winter, but withers when the heat
of Summer once comes. The other is as the Oak, that in Winter seems sear,
but when Summer comes sprouteth out, and continues fresh and green then,
when the grass is parcht and burnt up, or made hay of. Coloss. 3. 3, 4.
You are now dead, says the Apostle; and your life is hid with Christ; but
when Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall you also appear in
glory with him. As if he had said, It is now Winter time, and the sap lies hid
in the root with you, but when Summer comes, you shall spring out, and be in
your prime as trees and plants are Malach. 4. 2.
when the Sun approaches.

But more specially it is Winter with them at some time more than at others. As
in times of affliction, desertion, temptation and persecution. That is the
Winter that in the Cant. 2. 11.
Canticles the Spirit specially speaks of. And no marvel if joy and comfort
be then oft-times restrained with them; at least if they do not then so
apparently offer themselves to outward view. Who would expect or require leaves
or fruit ordinarily in Winter time from a tree? Not but that the godly have
even at such times also good ground even for great joy and much comfort;
howsoever they see it not for the present: or but that they have many of them
many times in many such cases, 2 Cor. 1. 5. and 7. 4.
as much joy and comfort as ever: (...), arbor, non avis, ut Tertull. de
resurr. (...) Psalm. 92. 12. and 1. 3. Ierem. 17. 8. (...). Plut. sympos.
problem. l. 8. c. 4. Palmae folia non decidunt. Plin. hist. not. l. 16. c. 20.
Ex eis quae semper virent, quaedam folia abjiciunt, ut Laurus and Pinus, alijs
clam subnascentibus, palma vero perpetuis vestita soliis, quae semel produxit,
ad finem usque retinet. Glycas ann. p. 1. c. 5.
like the Palm Tree in that regard, that keeps his green hew continually,
and never casts his leaf all the year long. But that then usually joy and
comfort is somewhat obscured with the most, with weak ones especially, who yet
when they are free from such fits, live as cheerfully, as joyfully, as
comfortably as any.

Such occasions and occurrents then are the godly subject unto now and then,
that through their weakness often disturb much and dim their joy for a time.
And are not worldly men also subject to many diseases, disasters, crosses,
griefs, discontentments, that set them often off the hinges, and mar all their
mirth? It is an unequal thing then for them to tax religion for that, or to
twit the religious with it, which (...). Simonides apud Plut. de util. ex inim.
to all other courses of life is incident as well as to it. An unequal thing
for them to require such an equal tenure of disposition from a Christian man,
in all occurrents and accidents, as no other is able to exhibit. They may
Exigis ut nulli gemitus tormenta sequantur? Acceptoque gravi vulnere flere
vetas? Ovid. trist. 5. 1. Nulla flendi major est causa qu^m flere no^ posse.
Pollio apud Se. co^trov. 4. 1. Misero si flere no licet, magis hlendum est.
Cestius ibid. 3. 8.
as well require mirth of a natural man in the midst of some sharp fit of a
burning fever or the like, as require alacrity and cheerfulness of a
Christian in some such cases.

But to come somewhat nearer home to the portion of Scripture that we have in
hand. Answer 9.
Is not the joy of the godly in this life either so full or so sensible? The
Reason is here intimated. It is Imperfectis adhuc gaudium saepe interscinditur.
S^^. epist. 72.
but Seed-time as yet. And to see to oft-times there is little difference,
though indeed there be much, between an acre of ground that lies still
vnsowen, and one that is sown with some precious seed.

And so pass we on to the second Point before propounded, Consider. 2.
how far forth Gods children do even here partake of this Joy. They are not
wholly deprived or debarred of it for the present. For they are incited unto
it, Verse. 12.
in the very next words to my Text. And yet they are not come to the whole crop
neither; it is not their Haruest-time yet: that is not till Matthew. 13. 39.
the worlds end. Light is sown for them, says the Psalmist.

Whence observe we, that

This Life is the religious man's Seed-time. Observe. 3.


Joy is but sown for him here.

As Iam. 3. 18. Gal. 6. 7, 8.
the fruit of Righteousness; so Light and Joy are said here to be sown.

And that principally for these causes:

1. Reason 1.
Because it is here hidden often, it is not so apparent to the eye; it is as
(...). Chrysostom. tom. 6. orat. 42.
corn in the ground, that lies there unseen: it is much clouded and obscured
with many crosses and conflicts.

2. Reason 2.
Because it seems buried and overwhelmed to some. As (...), etc. Chrysostom.
ibid. Solo sepulta credit quae sunt credita.
an ignorant person, that knew not the nature of grain, and the efficacy that
is in seed, would think it were not sown, but buried and cast away, when it
is cast into the ground, and laid up in the earth.

3. Reason 3.
Because it is not yet come to his height and full growth, or to that increase
that it will come unto. The grain may sprout in the ground, but Terra nunquam
sine usura reddit quod accepit. Cicde senect.
that is nothing in comparison to that that it is expected to come unto.

4. Reason 4.
Because it is even here a breeding, and in time it will break forth, spring
out, shoot up; yea so Psalm. 112. 4. Est. 8. 16.
it does also here; and in due time produce and bring forth a plentiful
Harvest. For, Psalm. 126. 5. Non spes solum fructus, sed and fructus est ipse in
semine. Bern. in Psalm. 90. sermon. 17.
Those that sow in tears, says the Psalmist, shall reap in joy. And where
this seed of Light and Joy is now sown, a further larger crop of it shall
there sometime succeed.

The consideration whereof may serve; Uses 4.


First, Use 1.
to admonish Gods children not to be dismayed and discouraged, Admonition.
or to grow discontent, if they cannot find and feel yet that large measure of
spiritual joy and comfort, that they desire, and expected, yea and in the word
of God is often promised. It is but our Seed-time yet. And would we have
Seed-time and Harvest concur? No, Iam. 5. 7.
Behold the Husbandman, says Saint James, how he waits fon the precious
fruit of the earth; and expects patiently till Zech. 10. 1.
the first and latter rain be passed on it. And in like manner must we have
patience till Gods Haruest-time come, and then shall we be sure to have our
full crop, whatsoever it please God to impart unto us of it before; in the
mean while looking constantly after the spiritual Deuteronomy. 32. 2. Hebr. 6. 7.
rain of the Word, and praying instantly for the sweet dewes of his Spirit, to
descend down upon our souls, for the cherishing and improuing of this seed of
joy sown in us. When we have laid our grain into the ground, we do not look
to see it the same day again, much less to reap the same day, (as he says
of the Hyperborean people far North, that Heresbach. de re rust.
they sow shortly after the Sun rising with them, and reap before the Sun
set, that is because the whole half year is one continual day with them:)
no, we expect not the next day, nor the next week neither, to see it again
above ground; but we are content to wait patiently till the year come about;
and are glad when we see it but after a month it may be, begin to peep out
of the ground, living in hope still of the further growth of it, and to enjoy at
length, after the spire and the blade, a full ear. So must we learn likewise
herein patiently to wait Gods good leisure, and though we see a long time but
slender growth, scarce any sight at all of it, yet not to be dismayed therefore
or discouraged, but Spes alit agricolas: spes sulcis credil aratis Semina, quae
magno samore reddit ager. Tibull. 2. 6.
live in hope, as the Husbandman does, of further increase of it, and of a
full crop at length, when God shall see it good. And the rather by much may we
live in hope, and Romans 4. 24. -credula vitam Spes fevet. - Tibull. ibid.
live by hope here than there, because the seed that is there sown, after it
is so sown may miscary; it may be cast into the ground, and die there, and so
never come up again: ( Joel 1. 17.
The grain, says Joel, is rotted under the clods:) it may spring up well, and
Exodus 9 31.
be blasted, while it is yet in the blade: it may be eared, and yet perish ere
it come to be cut: Joel 1. 5, 16. - s^pe est Spe^ mentita seges. Horat. l. 1.
ep. 7.
The meat, says the Prophet, is cut away from your mouth: that is, it is
spoiled and stroyed when it is full ripe, and fit for the sickle, when you make
full account to feed on it, and it is in a manner even in your mouths. But
this spiritual seed of light and joy ( Deradice siquide^ certius dici potest,

the maine matter and ground of it, I mean) that is sown in the hearts of
Gods children, being an incorruptible seed, shall never die and decay, but
though it may seem to lie dead there for a long time together, yet it shall
surely sprout out, and in time show forth it self; yea it is even then
sprouting, when it seems so to lie 1 Cor. 15. 36.
dead, and it will daily be growing, as the Mark. 4. 26, 27, 28. Gaudium exse

Sen. epist. 98.
seed cast into the ground, though it be not regarded, or notice taken of it,
till it come to its full growth. For Prove. 4. 18.
the way of the Just, says Solomon, is as the light, that shines more and
more till it be broad day light. And, Psalm. 37. 6, 7.
God will in his due time bring their righteousness forth as the light, and
their judgment as the noonday, that do quietly and constantly rest upon
him, and are content to wait and abide his pleasure. For, Gal. 6. 8.
He that sows to the Spirit, shall from the Spirit reap life eternal. And,
Prove. 11. 18.
He that sows righteousness, shall have a sure reward. And, Gal. 6. 9. Use
2. Caution.
In due time we shall reap, if we faint not.

In the mean space let us take heed, that we be not herein our own enemies;
that we do not by our disorders and excesses, by our own wickedness or
wantonness disturb wilfully our own peace, and so eclipse our own light, by
Esai. 59. 2. ^am. 3. 44.
interposition of some grievous enormities, which as Sol interventu Lunae
occultatur, Luna terrae objectu: ita vices redduntur, eosdem Solis radios Luna
interpositu suo auferente terrae, terraque Lunae. Plin. hist. not. l. 2. c. 10.
the dark body of the Earth coming between the Sun and the Moon, may be
a means to restrain the sweet influences of Gods Spirit, that otherwise we
might have enjoyed: ( Vis nunquam triflis esse? been vive. Bona vita semper
gaudiu^ habet. Aug. apud Tambac. de consol. Theolog. l. 9. and Isidor. de
mijer. hom. l. 2.
Would thou never be sad? says Augustine, have an eye to thy life, be
careful ever to live uprightly: A religious life can never want matter of much

negligent in the use of good means for the maintaining and feeding, yea 2 Timothy 1. 6.
for the stirring of it up, and the making of it burn clear, that so we may
walk cheerfully and comfortably in the light of it. For Zech. 4. 2, 3, 12.
light must, we know, be maintained, and often Exodus 27. 21.
tended and trimmed, or else it will but burn dim and afford little light.
Yea, if we do find at any time some defect in this kind, some restraint of
spiritual comfort, let us descend into our souls, and seriously examine our
selves, whether we nourish not within us some secret corruption, that may
choke this our joy, and like a thick fogge, or a filthy vapor ascending up
in our souls, may keep the light of Gods countenance from shining in upon us
so brightly as otherwise it would, or peradventure formerly it has done.

Again, Use 3. Exhortation.
Is this seed sown already? and is there a sure crop to come of it? Then, as
the Psalmist thereupon here infers, Verse. 12.
Rejoice, ye righteous, and be glad in the Lord. Be not as ground or land
that lies wholly vnsowen. Full glad is the Husbandman when he has had a
seasonable seed-time, and has got his grain once well into the ground. But
how merry, think you, would he be, if he could have his crop secured? This
should therefore serve again to incite and stir up all Gods Children, to
constant and continual joy and rejoicing, having so sound a seed of joy sown
in them, and being so sure of a large and plentiful crop of it: to say with
the blessed Virgin, Luke 1. 46, 47.
My soul does magnify the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior:
And with the Spouse in the Prophet, Esai. 61. 10.
I will greatly rejoice, and my soul shall be joyful (for why should it not
be so?) in my God; even Habb. 3. 18.
in the God of my salvation.

Yea it may well serve to check us, Use 4. Reprehension
for that fondly and wilfully we suffer our selves by every slight and trifling
occasion to be bereft of this joy, whereof Gods mercy and goodness has in
part put us here in present possession. There is Adhuc in nobis non pueritia,
sed, quod gravius est, puerilitas remanet. Sen. ep. 4. Etiam post jiuventam
canosque puerilitas est. Ide^^ de conflant. sap. c. 12.
a childish and peevish humor naturally in every one of us: and some tang and
taint of it we may observe even in Abraham; Genesis 15. 1, 2.
Fear not, Abraham, says GOD himself to Abraham; I am thy buckler, and rich
reward. But, Lord, what will thou give me, says Abraham to GOD again, so long
as I go childlesse? As if all he had were nothing, or he could have no joy of
any thing, so long as he was without that one thing, so long as he wanted a
son and heir: as Ester 5. 12, 13.
Haman had no joy of all his wealth and honor, and grace and favor with King
and Queen, so long as Ester 3. 2, 4, 5.
Mordecai crouched not to him, nor fawned on him, as others did. And the like
wayward humor is too rise with the most of us. We are like Contemnenda
miramur, pueris simillimi, quibus omne ludicrum in pretio est. Parentibus
quippe, nec minus fratribus, praeferunt parvo aere empta monilia: and tam
nucibus amissis flebunt quam parentibus. Sen. de ira l. 1. c. 12.

if some one of those toys be taken away from them, though they have many more
of them besides, will in a pettish humor cast all the rest away after it, and
sit whining for that one. The loss or want of some one trifle, and that such
sometime as a Christian man or woman might well be ashamed to make any
reckoning or account of, that either we had and have lost, or do want and
would have, I say not of Genes. 37. 34, 35. 2 Samuel 18. 33. and 19. 2-7. Ierem.

rich and glorious hopes of our eternal inheritance with him, were all nothing
in comparison of such a trifle as that, or not able to joy and cheer up our
hearts without it. This childish and sottish quality should we every one of us
take notice of in our selves, of too much pronenesse at least unto it, and Ab
hac te infamia vindica, ne videatur plus apud te valere unus dolor, quam haec
tam multa solatia. Sen. ad Polyb. consol. c. 31.
strive and labor against it, as being worthily ashamed of it, and considering
with our selves, what an unworthy thing it is, that the love and loss of such
pidling toys, yea or of any worldly thing whatsoever, should prevail so far
with us, as to deprive us of that joy and comfort that our blessed estate in
Christ Jesus even for the present may well minister unto us. An Heathen man
tells a Courtier that had lost his Son; that Fas tibi non est, salvo
Caesare, de fortuna tua queri. Hoc incolumi salvi tibi sunt tui. Nihil
perdidisti: non tantum siccos oculos tuos esse, sed etiam laetos oportet. In

he had no cause to mourn, either for that or ought else, as long as his
Sovereign was in safety, and he in favor with his Sovereign, he had all
things in him; and should be unthankful to his good fortunes, if he were not
cheerful both in heart and look, so long as things stood so with him, as
then they did. How much better may it be said to every true Christian, let his
wants and his losses be never so great, that he has little cause to mourn for
them, so long as he is in grace and favor with God; Deum habens, oi^a habes.

Yea, but how can we rejoice, peradventure will some say, (...). etc. Basil.
Caes. hom. 4. Quem vide ibid. and homil. etiam 5.
amids so many crosses and calamities Objection.
as Gods Church and Children are daily vexed and annoyed with, yea and our
selves also among the rest? Or how can we rejoice, when we have so many sins
and corruptions to be sorry for? Yea, how may we lawfully rejoice, when Esai.
22. 12.
we are called unto heaviness and solemn humiliation, when we are commanded
and enjoined by God, to mourn and lament? When either our own estate or Gods
Churches is such, that Amos 6. 6. See the Spark.
not to be sorry, and to be even sick with sorrow, may well seem a sin?

To this I answer:

1. Answer 1.
We must ever remember so to keep one Commandment, that we break not
another. Matthew. 4. 17. Mark. 1. 14.
Repent, is one Commandment; Matthew. 5. 12. Luke 10. 20.
Rejoice, is another. And he that commands the one, has enjoined also the
other. As Saint James therefore reasons, Iam. 2. 11.
He that said, Thou shall not kill, has said also, Thou shall not commit
adultery; though thou do not kill therefore, yet if thou do commit
adultery, thou art a transgressor. So here, he that has commanded us to be
sorry for our sins, and for the afflictions of our brethren, has commanded us
also 1 Thessalonians. 5. 16.
evermore to rejoice. And therefore though we fail not in sorrow for our
sins, or for our brethrens afflictions, yet if we wilfully banish and abandon
this spiritual joy which Gods Spirit requires of us, we make our selves
thereby guilty of sin in Gods sight. A sin it may be 1 C^r. 5. 2.
not to be sorry at some time: and a sin it is for Gods Child at any time not
to joy. They say that Praecepta negativa ligant semper and ad semper.
Affirmativa semper, sed non ad semper. Tho^. Aquin. sum. p. 1^. 2. ^. q. 71. a.
5. and q. 88. a. 1. and q. 100. a. 10. and Gerson. reg. mor.
Negative precepts or prohibitions only, tie at, and unto all times: But this
Affirmative iniunction also concerning a Christian man's joy, Continuum vult
esse and no^ interruptum gaudium nostrum. Gilbert. in Cant. 10.
admits no intermission, but tieth unto all times. Sorrow may be sometime
out of season: this spiritual joy, as of some food we say, is never
unseasonable. The godly are at some times Nehem. 8. 9, 10.
prohibited the one: they are never inhibited, but enjoined ever the other. Yea
mark what I say; it is undoubtedly true: Albeit few be prone to offend that
way, yet a man may offend even in excessive sorrow for sin, in thinking too
much on his sins, in mourning vnmeasurably for his sins. If such thy
meditation of thy sin, and sorrow for thy sin shall so far prevail with
thee, that thou art wholly 2 Cor. 2. 7.
swallowed up with it, or by means of it, art either Quomodo Sen^ ad Polyb. c.
26. Non licet tibi flere, ut multos flentes audire possis. Vt periclitantium
lachrymae possint, tibi tuae assiccandae sunt.
detained from, or disabled unto, and made wholly unfit for the performance of
other necessary duties, that thy sorrow does then make thee guilty of sin,
and thou have just cause to be sorry for that sorrow.

2. Answer 2.
Joy and grief, in some degree at least, may well stand together. As true joy
may well stand with some fear. Psalm. 2. 11. Sic Matthew. 28. 8.
Rejoice before him, says the Psalmist, with fear. So Habemus luctum gaudio
mixtu^. Petr. Martyr. in 2 Samuel 24.
true joy may well stand with some grief. 2 Cor. 6. 10.
As sorrowing, says the Apostle, and yet always rejoicing. He that has
commanded us to sorrow sometime, would never else have enjoined us Philip. 4. 4.
at all times to rejoice. There is joy even in grief; as there is grief even
in joy. Yea, though it may seem strange, yet it is questionless true, the
greater grief sometime the greater joy; and the greater joy, the greater
grief. A man may at the same time both be exceeding sorry for his sin, and
yet rejoice exceedingly in the apprehension of Gods mercy, in the free pardon
and forgiveness of it. Yea, the greater grief a man has for his sins, the
more cause of joy he has even in that regard. And the greater joy a man has
in the apprehension of Gods favor in the forgiveness of his sin, the
greater grief and sorrow for his sin it usually works in him. As where 1
John 4. 18.
the servile fear cease, that regards nothing but wrath, there the filial
Hosh. 3. 5. Timor ne pecces. Aliud est enim timere quia peccaveris; aliud
timere ne pecces. Philip. in Job.
fear of offending grows usually most rife: For 1 John 4. 19.
the more a man is assured of Gods love toward him, the more he loves God;
and Genes. 39. 9. Psalm 97. 10. Prove 8. 13. Absit enim ut timore p^reat amor, si
castus est timor. Aug. in Psalm. 118. Nemo melius diligit, quam qui maxim
veretur offendere. Salvian. ep. 4.
the more he loves him, the more afraid is he of offending him: So Cessat
horror, crescit dolor.
where the inward gals cease of a guilty conscience, there sincere grief for
sin grows fresher than ever before. To illustrate this by some familiar
comparison. Suppose one that stood guilty of high Treason against his
Sovereign, and that not in some inferior kind, but in the highest degree,
either having made a violent assault upon the person of 1 Samuel 24. 7, 11. and
26. 9.
the Lords Anointed, or having not by accident, as Adrastus Midae filius,
Gordrj nepos. Herodot. in C^o. Is ^iquidem Aty^ Cr^^si filium errore pari
interfecit, quo Gualterus Tirrell Guliel^^on Rufum Anglorum Regem inter
venandum interemit. Henr. Hunting. rer. Angl. l. 7. and Rog. Hoveden annal.
part. 1.
he sometime that slew Craesus his Son, but by a malicious train taken away
the life of his only Son that should have succeeded him, having no other
issue, in the Kingdom; and having been arraigned and condemned for the same,
yet should by his Sovereign out of his gracious disposition, and at the
earnest suit of some about him, have the fact pardoned him, and his pardon sent
him. This party doubtless, as he could not but exceedingly rejoice in so
undeserved, in so unexpected a favor; so withal, if he had any spark of
grace or good nature at all in him, the very apprehension of his Sovereigns
gracious disposition, would make him mourn for his foul fact more than ever
before, considering with himself how wretchedly and unworthily he had carried
himself toward one whom he found so graciously, beyond and above all, either
expectation or imagination, disposed. The case is ours in effect: and not to
insist long upon application of it: It may hereby plainly appear, how
spiritual joy, may well stand with godly grief, and these two affections that
seem the one contrary to the other, may yet agree well together in a Christian
man's soul: since that the more a man ioyeth in the assurance of Gods goodness
toward him, the more he must needs grieve to consider how by his wicked and
rebellious courses, he has demeaned himself wretchedly and unworthily toward
that God, whom he finds so graciously affected toward him.

Compare Psalm. 32. 1, 5. with Psalm. 51. 1, 2, 17. Possumus simul and dolere in
nobis, and gaudere in Domino. Petr. Martyr. in 2 Samuel 24.
A man may mourn for his sins then, and yet rejoice in Gods mercy; be sorry
for his transgression, and yet have joy of his pardon. And in like manner may
he be grieved heartily for the present afflictions of Joseph, and that even so
as he may be sick with grief again; and yet withal be cheered and
comforted in the consideration of that happy issue of them, that Verse. 8, 10.
^sai. 27. 1, 3. and 49. 15. 1 Cor. 10. 13.
Gods fatherly care of his Church, his power, his providence, his gracious
promise, and his own Faith building thereupon, give him good hope and
assurance, that they shall have in the end. For the Grief of Gods Children in
these cases is not a desperate grief, but Psalm. 102. 13, 19, 20. and 119. 49,
50, 52, 81.
a sorrow mixed with Faith and Hope. (...). Nubecula est, illico pertransibit.
Athanasius apud Socratem hist. Eccles. l. 3. c. 14.
It is but a storm, said that good Bishop, and within a while it will ^uer.
And, Psalm. 125. 3.
The Rod of the wicked, says the Psalmist, shall not rest upon the Lot of the
Righteous. Psalm. 94. 14.
Nor will God utterly cast off his people; Lament. 3. 31.
nor forsake his inheritance for ever. Lam. 3. 32.
But though he send afflictions in upon them, Dan. 11. 35.
to scour and to cleanse them, yet Mica 7. 19.
he will return again to them, and have compassion on them, Psalm. 106. 45.
according to the multitude of his mercies; and Psalm. 126. 4.
turn again their Captivity, as the Rivers in the South. Esai. 10. 5, 12,
16, 17, 18.
When he has by their adversaries wrought his own work upon them, (for Ejus
consilijs militant, etiam qui ejus consilijs repugnant. Greg. Agunt quod vult
Deus, sed no^ volunt quod vult Deus. Bern. de great. and lib. arb.
even such also do his work, though against their own will:) Psalm. 81. 14.
he will turn his hand upon them, and Psalm. 78. 66. and 9. 5.
utterly destroy them, Vtitur Deus creatura rationali sed malevola, ut virga,
quam correcto silio pater in ignem tanquam sarmentum inutile abjicit. Bern. de
great. and lib. arb.
as the Father Puer ergo es, qui nisi virgam qua verberatus es, verberari aut
cremari videris, plorare non desistis. Idem inecstas.
to please the Child again, and to testify his reconcilement to it, is
content sometime to cast the rod into the fire, that he had corrected it with
before. Yea the more men take Gods wrath to heart, and the more they are
humbled under his hand, (be the same either on themselves or others,) the more
comfort may they have in their humiliation, as conceiving thereby the greater
hope and assurance, that God will in mercy the sooner hasten the deliverance
of his distressed ones, and the confusion of their oppressors.

And thus again may a man Psalm. 119. 158, 139.
mourn as heartily for the sins also of others, as he does or would do for
his own, and Psalm. 119. 136. Ierem. 9. 1.
lament even with floods of tears their folly, and misery like to ensue on it;
and yet Psalm. 119. 162, 163, 166. Ier. 16. 19.
have joy withal of his own conversion, and assurance of salvation: as Suave,
mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis, E terra magnum alterius spectare
laborem; No^ quia vexari quenqua^ est jucunda voluptae, Sed quibus ipse malis
careas, quia cernere suave est. Lucret. l. 2. (...). Basil. Caes. hom. 4.
those that are safe on shore, having escaped shipwreck, may at the same time
both commiserate the distress and danger of those that are still wallowing in
the Sea amids the waves, and bickering with the billows there, in ieopardie
every instant to be swallowed up irrecouerably in the deep; and yet the whilst
rejoice also in, and be thankful unto God for their own safety. Joy and
grief therefore may well concur and agree together. Lex legi non miscetur;
(sed nec adversatur:) utraque sua it vta. Sen. de benef. l. 6. c. 6.
Nor do Gods Commandments herein cross or contradict one another. We may
well sorrow sometimes, and yet always rejoice.

3. Answer 3.
Even in the greatest afflictions may Gods Children have much joy. For, Psalm.
112. 4. Lux oritur justo, quae non oritur injusto. Aug. in Psalm. 96.
To the just, or the upright, arises light in darkness, says the Psalmist.
Esai. 59. 10.
The ungodly meet with darkness often in the day: the godly have light often even
in the night: Amos. 8. 9.
The Sun goes down at noonday often with the one: it rises often even at
midnight with the other. 1 Pet. 1. 8.
In whom you trust, says Saint Peter, and rejoice with a joy unspeakable and
glorious; albeit, by occasion of manifold temptations, ye are for a season in
some sorrow. And, Iam. 1. 2.
My Brethren, says Saint James, count it exceeding joy, when you fall into
many trials or troubles. And, ^ Cor. 7. 4.
Great is my rejoicing; I am full of comfort; I have joy ouer-abundant in all
my tribulations, says Saint Paul. They may retain joy in them, yea they may
draw matter of joy from them. Sapienti contexitur gaudium: nulla rumpitur
causa, nulla fortuna. Sen. ep. 72.
They may retain joy in them: For it is another kind of matter, and a matter
of far greater consequence, that is the ground of their joy. Nunquam
credideris foelice^ quenquam ex foelicitate suspensum: fragilibus innititur,
qui adventitio laetus est. Ibid. 98.
A Christian man's joy depends not upon freedom from afflictions, but Romans 5.
1, 2, 3.
upon the assurance of Gods favor toward him for the present, and upon his
hopes of future matters. Yea they may draw matter of joy from them: Since they
do, or may know that they are good for them, and do work for their good:
Philip. 1. 19.
I know, says the Apostle, that this shall turn to my salvation. And, Romans 8.
28.
All things work together for the good of those that love God. And as the
sick man therefore may rejoice at the coming of the Surgion, (though he know
full well that he must needs put him to much pain,) that comes to saw off
some part gangreaned, or to cut him of the stone: So may the godly have joy,
not in only, but In ipsa tribulatione spes gloriae est: imo and ipsa in
tribulatione gloria co^tinetur: sicut spes fructus in semine, sic and ipse
fructus in semine est. Bern. in Psalm. 90. ser. 17.
of those afflictions that befall them, knowing them to be Hebr. 12. 6, 10.
(...). Aristot. ethic. l. 2. c. 3. (...). Idem rbel. l. 1. c. 14.
Gods loving and fatherly chastisements of them for their good; and considering
that Hebr. 12. 11.
though no such chastisement for the time seem joyous, but grievous, yet they
bring forth the peaceable fruit of righteousness in those that are therewith
exercised. And this the rather, when the afflictions that befall them are such,
as tend directly to give them the greater assurance of their future eternal
happiness. As the Apostle tells the Philippians, That Philip. 1. 19.
their adversaries rage and fury against them, was as well an evident sign of
the salvation of the one, as of the destruction of the other: and the
Thessalonians, That 2 Thessalonians. 1. 5.
their sufferings for Christ and his Kingdom, did evidently show that God had
vouchsafed them a part in that Kingdom, for which he had called them in such
sort to suffer: and that 2 Thessalonians. 1. 7.
their troubles here were a pledge and seal of their eternal rest there. For,
(...). 2 Timothy 2. 11, 12.
This is a true and a sure assertion, says the same Apostle, that if we die
with Christ, we shall live with him; if we suffer for him, we shall reign
with him. And why may not Gods Children rejoice then, even in their greatest
afflictions, when they shall consider that 2 Cor. 4. 17.
this (...).
light trouble that lasts but for a short season shall procure unto them, as
the Apostle speaks, (...)
. an exceeding excessive eternal weight of glory. For the further confirmation
and fuller illustration of this point, consider we the Nature of that excellent
Creature, one of Genes. 1. 3. 2 Cor. 4. 6. (...). Basil. hexa^. sermon. 2.
the first of Gods works, that this Joy of Gods Children is compared to in my
Text. Concerning which, I will make bold to insert here a very comfortable
Meditation of a Namelesse Author, and that somewhat more largely, because the
Book is not commonly to be had. A Sermon on the Psalm Qui habitat, or Psalm
91. translated out of high Dutch into English, and printed at London by Leonard
Askell.
We see and prove, says this Author, by daily experience, how powerful and
dreadful a thing the darkness of the Night is. For when it falls, - luccque
pulja Telluris toti tenebra^ induxerat orbi Vmbra. Ovid. metam. l. 13. - ruit
Oceano nox, Involvens umbra magna terramque polumque. Virg. Aen. l. 2.
it covers and muffleth up the face of the whole world; Iam color unus inest

7.
it obscureth and hides the hue and the fashion of all creatures; it binds
up all hands, and breaks off all employments; ( John 9. 4. Tempus erat, quo

candles light that is lighted, withstandeth the whole night, and not only
suffers not the darkness to cover, or to smother ano oppress it, but it
gives light also even in the midst of the darkness, and beats it back
for some space and distance on every side of it: So that which way soever it is
borne, or wheresoever it comes, there must darkness depart and give place
unto the light; all the power and the dreadfulnesse of it, cannot help or
prevail ought against it. And though the Light be so weak, that it cannot
cast light far about, or drive the darkness far from it, as in the spark of
an hot coal, yet cannot the darkness cover or conceal, and much less quench
it; but it gives light to it self alone at least, so that it may be seen a
far off in the dark; and it remains unconquered of the dark, though it
cannot help other things, nor give light unto them. Yea (that that is yet more
wonderful) Felium in tenebris fulgent radiantque oculi: quin and multorum
piscium refulgent aridi; sicut robusti caudices vetustate putres. Plin. hist.

a rotten shining piece of wood, which has the faintest light that can be
found, yet remains invincible of all the power of darkness; and the more it
is compassed about with darkness, the clearer light it gives. So little is
darkness able to overcome or keep down any light; but that it rules, and
vanquisheth, and expels the darkness, which else ouerwhelmeth, and suareth,
and fettereth and puts all things in fear. Now if this Natural Light, but

in the fire flaming on every side of them, have found greater comfort than
ever they did when they were free from those afflictions; have had such strange
joys even there and then imparted unto them, as they were scarce ever before
acquainted with. To persuade the godly Martyrs to courage, constancy and
cheerfulness in their sufferings for Christ's cause, the Ancients used a
twofold Consideration. One was, that they could expect to suffer no harder nor
harsher things, at the hands of cruel Tyrants, Horretis omnes hascecarnificum

than diverse had done, and had been willing to yield themselves unto, upon
advice of the Physician, at the hands of the Surgeon. Another was, that no
cruelty could be exercised upon them, but that some Timebit forsan caro

incredibilia sunt apud cos qui virtutem colunt, cum apud eos quoque
reperiantur, apud quos voluptas imperat? Sen. epist. 92.
If, says he, such things be found among those with whom pleasure reigns,
why should they seem incredible with those that follow Virtue? Quod si hoc

tantum provero habeat erogare, quantu^ alij profalso? Tert. ad Martyr.
If a vain shadow, a liuelesse image of virtue could prevail thus far with
some: why may not true Faith and Christian Fortitude effect as much or much
more with others? Si tantum terrenae gloriae licet de corporis and animi

4. There is no time, Answer 4.
no state whatsoever, wherein the godly man has not great cause of joy. It
were unreasonable to require such incessant joy of such evermore and at all
times, had not such at all times good reason to rejoice. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 16.
Rejoice evermore, says the Apostle: and, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 18.
In all things give thanks. And surely, if we ought, as the same Apostle
elsewhere says, Ephesians. 5. 20.
At all times and in all things to be thankful; then questionless we ought at
all times and in all things to be joyful, as well in adversity, as in
prosperity, as well in afflictions, as in freedom from them, as well when
things fall our cross, as when it fares with us as we would. The godly man
then has at al times good and just cause of joy: it is appare^t. For, (...)
Greg. Naz. ep. 62.
Gods injunctions are not unreasonable. But I go a step further, and dare be
bold to auerre it, that every righteous man, every one that is truly religious,
has at all times, if he could himself see it and apprehend it, much more
matter of joy, than he has of grief, or can have. For what does or can
minister more matter of grief, than Gods favor and love in Christ may afford
matter of joy? And those therefore that are ever in the favor of God, (what
should I need to add; and that live in hope of eternal glory with God?) can
at no time have so great cause of grief, but that they have even at the
selfsame time much more cause of joy. But every godly man is ever in favor
with God: Hut illud Sen. ep. 59. Doc^bo quomodo intelligas te non esse
sapientem. Sapiens ille est, qui plenus gaudio, qui inco^cussus, qui nunquam
moestus est: ad omnem incursum munitus and interritus: non si paupertas, non si
luctus, non si ignominia, n^^ si dolor impetum faciat, pedem referet:
interritus and contra illa ibit and inter illa.
Every godly man therefore has ever and at all times, if he were so wise as to
apprehend it, more ample matter of joy by much than of grief.

Yea, Objection.
but it is the Just or the Righteous man, will peradventure some say, that
must, that may thus rejoice: And where are any such? Prove. 20. 9.
Who can say, says Solomon, I have so purified mine heart, that I am wholly
free from sin? No: Eccles. 7. 20.
There is no man Just or righteous on earth, that does ever well, and 1 King.
8. 46. (...) Greg. Naz. de pace 1. (...) I Would de plag. grand. (...) Ide^ in
Basil.
never evil. A vain thing may it seem then to exhort men to rejoice, when
the condition annexed is such as excludes all from rejoicing. To what end is
it to incite the Just to rejoice, when there are none such that may rejoice?

The answer is ready at hand, in the latter part of the Verse. By Just are
meant all such as are Upright in heart.

Which clause is added;

Partly to exclude the Hypocrite,

And partly to temper and qualify the rigor of the term before used,
Answer. Considerat. 3. Illustration.
if it were strictly and exactly taken.

So that it is a note as well of Extent, as of Restraint: Uses 2.


1. Use 1. Restraint.
Of Restraint to exclude from this joy, and all right thereunto and interest
therein, all dissemblers, all counterfeit Christians, all hollow-hearted
Hypocrites; that repent in the face, but not in the heart; Math. 6. 16. (...).
Esai. 58. 3, 5.
that make a sour face, that they may seem to fast, says our Savior; that
Luke 16. 15.
justify themselves in the sight of men, Extent.
but God sees their hearts what they are, Sorts 6.
and sees them to be far other than either they should be, Sort 1.
or they pretend themselves to be. Ficta, non recta.


2 Of extent, Use 2.
to extend and enlarge this joy, the ground of it and the right to it, to all
that are single and sincere-hearted: and so to give and afford a share and a
portion in it as well to those that are sincerely righteous on earth, as to
those that are perfectly righteous in heaven.

It is as a key to let in the one;

It is as a bolt to spar and bar out the other.

To clear this further by a distinction or two of Bernards and Ambrose.

There are six either sorts or degrees of Justice or Righteousness.

1. Ficta, sed non recta: fained or counterfeit Righteousness, but not sincere
or sound. Such as Matthew. 23. 27, 28. Ficta, fucata, non vera, sincera. (...). 2 Timothy 3. 5.
the Pharisees was. Multi hominibus justi videntur, pauci Deo. Aliter enim
hominibus, and aliter Deo. Hominibus secundum externam speciem and faciem: Deo
sec. internam veritatem and virtutem. Ambr. in Luc. 1. 6.
A righteousness in outward show and semblance, but not in inward truth and
substance. Like (...). Nihil enim simulatum and fictum verae virtutis esse
certum est. Ambr. offic. l. 2. c. 22.
counterfeit coin, that has the Kings stamp indeed, but is base and bad
metal, and is therefore naught worth.

2. Sort 2
Recta, sed non pura, Recta, non pura. Vera and recta; sed non pura, nec
perfecta.
non perfecta: A Righteousness, sound and sincere, but not perfectly pure.
When, though sin do Romans 7. 17.
remain still with men, yet it does Romans 6. 14. Psalm. 119. 133. Manet peccatu^
dejectu^ quide^, sed non ejectum; evulsum, no^ expu^sum tamen. Rern. in Ps. 90.
10.
not reign in them. There is a mixture in them, as of Light and Darkness,
dimnesse at least, in a painted glass, died with some obscure and dim
color: it is transparent and gives good, but not clear and pure light. And
Nostra, si qua est, humilis justitia recta forsitan, sed non pura: quomodo. n.
pura, ubi non potest deesse culpa? Idem de temp. 104.
such is the righteousness of all faithful persons while they live here.

3. Sort 3.
Pura, sed non firma: A righteousness pure and perfect, but not firm and
permanent. Such was the Righteousness of our first Parents before their fall.
Nam primi hominis in initio non mod^ recta, sed etiam pura fuit, quamdiu ei
datum est nec sentire peccatum. Bern. ibid. nedum inservire, aut consentire
pecca^o.
Pure and perfect it was: for Genes. 1. 27. Ephesians. 4. 24.
such did God create them: Pura, non firma.
they had no sense at first of any evil motion at all in them, much less did
they yield or give any consent to any such. But Sed quia firma non fuit, and
puritatem facile perdian, nec rectitud^e^ retinuit. ibid.
firm and permanent it was: (it might have been, if they would:) for Eccles.
7. 29.
they changed wilfully that estate that God created them in, and so fell away
from that their original Righteousness.

4. Sort 4.
Firma, sed finita: A righteousness not pure only, Firma, sed finita.
but firm too, yet finite: Such is Mat. 25* 31. 1 Timothy 5. 21. Apud Angelos
recta, pura, and firma, sublimis, sed divina tamen inferior. A Deo collata, no^
ipsis innata. Iusti ex eo, no^ cora^ eo; munere ejus, no^ in co^paratione ejus.
^ernab.
the righteousness of the elect Angels, and of Heb. 12. 23. Iusti perfecti.
the blessed Saints glorified in part now in heaven: and shall be of Luke 20.
36. Angelis pares.
all the Elect as well Men as Angels after the last day.

5. Sort 5.
Infinita: An infinite righteousness. Such is the righteousness Dei solius.
Ipse sibi justitia est, c^jus voluntas no^ ta^ aequa, qua^ipsa aequit as; and
(...) qua^psa substantia. Bern, ib.
of God alone; Infinita.
of him that is not righteous only, but even Righteousness it self: and the
Righteousness of all Creatures both men and Angels put together, is as 1 Samuel
2. 2. Matthew. 19. 17.
none in regard of his, being the same with himself.

The first of them is, in this term, excluded from sound joy; the second is
admitted to it, as well as the third or the fourth, yea therefore rather than
the third by much, because it is sure in time to attain to the fourth: and it
may well therefore constitute a distinct sort or degree to make up the number
propounded at first, Sort 6.
to wit, Firma, no^ perfecta.
imperfecta, sed firma, or firma, sed non pura, non perfecta: Philip. 3. 12.
Cum haec omnia desiderio affectus impleverit, non ex omni part perfectus, sed
perficiendus. Prosper. de vit. contempl. lib. 1. cap. 8.
An imperfect Righteousness, but yet firm; or a firm and permanent
Righteousness, though not yet pure and perfect: Since that the Grace of God
begun here in the Hearts of his holy ones, though never so infirm and weak in
it self, yet being 1 Pet. 1. 5. Firmior est fides quam reponit po^itentia.
Lactant. institut. l. 5. c. 13.
supported and vpheld by the power of his Spirit, is sure never wholly or fully
to fail: but as the light that the Moon receives from the Sun, though to
our seeming but very little at first shortly after the change, as we term it,
yet it increases more and more daily, till it come to the full; so shall Pr^v.
4. 18.
the light of Grace in Gods Children, though Tanquam (...), ubi plus luminis
quam tenebrarum, sed (...), ubi pl' tenebraru^ quam luminis: uti distingu^^t
gra^^^atici ad Homerum. Eu^^th Odyss. (...).
but little, scarce sensible at the first either to others or themselves, yet
it shall grow on till it come to it full growth; which when it has once
attained, (that which will not be in this life) it will never (herein contrary
to the manner of the Moon) impair or abate again.

So that the Point that hence arises is this, Point 3.
that

Joy belongs to the Upright, Branches 2.


And to the Upright only.

First to the Upright; Branch 1.
that is, as well to those that be sincere-hearted, as to those that be
perfectly and exactly righteous: yea to all upright, be they strong or weak
ones, be they well grown, Righteous.
or but newborn babes in Christ Jesus. Rancks 2.


For whereas there are two ranckes of Men truly Righteous: Division 1.


The former of such righteous ones as never fell, Rank 1.
never sinned: Rank 2.
the estate of 1 Timothy 5. 21.
the elect Angels, that Luke 15. 7.
need no repentance, that like the Prodigals elder Brother, Luke 15. 31.
never left their Fathers house, Luke 15. 29.
nor ever offended him in ought.

The latter of such righteous ones (...). Greg. Naz. apolog. (...). Ide^ de
plag. grand. and in Iul. 2. Pri^^ virtus peccata non perpetrare sed vitare;
secunda perpetrata corrigere. Greg. mor. l. 6. c. 17.
as have fallen indeed, but are risen again, through Gods mercy in Christ
their Savior, Ephesians. 1. 19, 20. and 2. 1, 5, 6.

repentance: the state of all the faithful in part f renewed, and regenerate,
and restored again to their Original Righteousness:

Or to come nearer to the Point;

The former of those that are Iusti habitu perfecto.
righteous in regard of a perfect habit, or an absolute perfection of
righteousness: And 1 Pet. 3. 11. Act. 3. 14. 1 John 3. 5.
so our Savior Christ only here on earth was; and Hebr. 12. 23.
the Saints saved Division 2.
now in heaven are. Rank 1.


The latter of those that are Iusti desider^o, studio, co^titu.
righteous in regard Rank 2.
of the desire, study, endeavor, and imperfect practice, rather than
perfection of righteousness: Such as sincerely desire to fear, and to serve
God; and endeavor constantly to do his will: as have respect to Gods
Commandments: and think upon them to observe them: though they cannot keep
or fulfill them so as they should: that follow after righteousness, as a
worke-man does his trade, that he has bound himself an apprentice to, though
he be not yet his crafts-master: And so Job 1. 1.
Job is said to be Just, though he had his infirmities and failings, by his
own confession, Job 9. 3.
not a few. So Luke 1. 6.
Zachary and Elizabeth are said to have been righteous in Gods sight; that
is, truly and sincerely, though not perfectly, righteous: for they were Luke 1.
20. Vide Aug. ad 2. Epist. Pelag. l. 4. c. 7.
not also without their wants. And even these latter also have right to, and
may have part in the joy here propounded as well as the former, though the
former enjoy it far more fully than they do. For, 2 Chronicles. 30. 18, 19.
God will be merciful, yea he has already been, and is merciful, to those
that set their hearts aright, and Nehem. 1. 11.
that desire to fear his name. And, 1 Chronicles 28. 7.
I will be with him, says God of Solomon, if he endeavor to do my will. And,
Psalm. 119. 6.
Then, says David, shall I not be confounded, when I have respect to all thy
Precepts: and Psalm. 22. 23.
When I am upright with my God. And, Psalm. 103. 17, 18.
The loving kindness of the Lord is from ever and for ever, upon those that
think upon his Commandments to do them. And, Prove. 21. 21.
He that follows after Righteousness shall find Honor and Life; true
honor and eternal Life. For Romans 2. 8.
unto those that by patient perseverance in well-doing seek honor, and glory,
and immortality, will God render Life eternal.

And therefore to such also, even in express terms is joy promised; and such
also in express terms are enjoined to rejoice. Psalm. 64. 10.
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in him; and all (without
exception) that are upright in heart, shall rejoice. And as here, Light is
sown for the righteous; so elsewhere, Psalm. 112. 4.
Light in darkness arises to the upright. And again, having in the beginning
of the Psalm pronounced them blessed, not that never sinned, but Psalm. 32. 2.
that have sincerely repented them of their sins; in whose soul there is no
guile: he concludes with an incitement, yea an iniunction laid upon all such
to rejoice: Psalm. 32. 11.
Be glad, ye righteous, and rejoice in the Lord; and be merry, yea shout for
joy, all ye that are upright in heart. Reason 4.
And if there be Luke 15. 7.
great joy in heaven for such; Reason 1.
sure there may well be much joy also here on earth unto such.

And this may be further confirmed unto us, if we shall consider:

1. That it is not so much the quantity, as the quality and sincerity of his
grace in us that God principally regards. Melius est pallens auru^ quam
fulgens aurichalcum. Bern. in Cant. 61. (...). Greg. Naz. apolog.
A little pale and course Gold is of much more worth than much bright Copper,
than much fine Brass. And De No^ Basil. Sell. homil. 5. (...). Valentinus apud
Iren. l. 1. c. 33.
a good piece of Gold is true Gold, though it be bemired and besmeared with
dirt; an ingot of Gold, is good Gold, though it have much dross still mixed
with it. Nec vin^m rejicimus, etsi foecem habeat; nec aurum qua^vis lutosum
existat. Spin. de justit. Christ.
Nor will a man that is in his wits cast away his money, be it Gold or Silver,
for the foulness of it, or the Goldsmiths his wedge for the dross that is
mixed with it: but where he meets with never so little good gold, and it be
but a grain or two, mixed with never so much dross, he will not leave the gold
for the dross, but keep the dross with the gold, till he have fined it, and
so severed and freed the one from the other. In like manner here: Gods grace in
the hearts of his Children, though it be mixed still with many infirmities, yea
and corruptions, yet is it true Grace, and much better than all those seeming
Simulacra virtutis. Cic. de offic. l. 1. Vmbra est and imago justitiae quod
illi justitiam putaverunt. Ex Cic. ipso Lactant. institut. l 6. c. 6.
shadows, and though glorious, yet but counterfeit shows of it, that are
found either in Heathen men's lives, or in the courses of Hypocrites. Nor will
God therefore, in regard of those infirmities and corruptions mixed with it,
reject it, but rather have a care of them in whom it is, Esai. 1. 25. and 4. 4.
and 57. 18. Ierem. 9. 7.
to cure and to correct them, that his Grace by the remouall and amendment of
them, may grow daily more pure, till it come at length unto Ephesians. 5. 26, 27.

A strange matter, says Augustine, the woman is still honest, and yet art thou
an adulterer; the man is alive still, and yet thou art a murderer. So is it
also Nisi forte putetur in malo quam in bono efficacior inveniri vol^ntas apud
Deum, qui charitas est, and promptior esse ad ulciscendum quam ad remumerandum
misericors and miserator Dominus. Bern. epist. 77. Vide Platonis cum Dio^ysio
de Aes^hine dissertatione^ apud Plut. de adul.
in goodness: the study, desire and endeavor, the constant study, sincere
desire, and earnest endeavor of holiness and righteousness, make a man
esteemed holy and righteous in Gods sight, though he cannot yet attain to
that measure of it that he would. God regards more what he desires and
endeavors to be, than what he is; he respects more what he desires and
endeavors to do, than what he does.

3. Reason 3.
That God exacteth no more of his, than he has bestowed on them. Matthew. 25.
15, 16, 17.
He requires not the gain of ten talents, where he has given out but five,
or the profit of five, where he has conferred but one only. (...) Greg. Naz.
in Caesar.
He is content to accept of his what they are able to afford, in grace and
mercy pardoning, passing by and remitting the rest. Mala. 1. 14.
Cursed is the Deceiuer, or the Coosener, says the Prophet, that having a
Mascu^u, i. masculum pinguem and integru^. sicut, lana, pro lana condida. Esai.
1. 18. D. Ca^us in Mal.
sound or a fat Male in his flock, brings a corrupt carrion or a lean
starueling to God for a sacrifice. But (...). Greg. Naz. de cutax. Non

libro scribuntur omnes, qui quod possunt, faciunt, etsi quod debent, non
possunt. Ide^ de Dco dilig. c. 2.
he is not accursed that brings no better, because he has no better to
bring. Yea observe we in the legal sacrifices and oblations, how low in mercy
God descends. It is true that if men should serve God and sacrifice to him,
according to his state and his greatness, Esai. 40. 15, 16.
all the wood of Lebanon would not serve to burn, nor all the beasts that be
in it suffice for a sacrifice; yea little enough would all the wood in the
world be, and all the cattle therein to it, to make up but one sacrifice. Yet
see how low God is content to stoop herein, in regard of man's beggerlinesse,
not able to give or offer ought worthy of God. Levit. 5. 6, 11, 12. and 14. 10,
21, 30, 31. (...). Grog. Naz. de Eutax.
He is content to accept of a sheep or two, or a lamb or two for a
sacrifice; or if a man be not able to bring so much, he is well pleased with
one; or if he want means for a lamb, he is not unwilling to take a pair of
Turtle Doves, or two little Pigeons in stead of it; yea if a man's ability be
not able to reach so far neither, Imminis ara^ si tetigit man^s, Non
sumptuosa blandior hostia Mollibit adversas Penates Thure pio and saliente
mica. Horat. carm. 3. 22.
an handful or two of flower, with a corn of salt or two, shall suffice as
well as ought else, where it is brought and offered with an honest heart. And
it is more than once or twice inculcated for the comfort and encouragement of
weak ones, (...). Greg. Naz. de bapt. and apud Anton. Melissae. 33.
of the poorer sort, that were not able to offer as the rich did, and might
doubt therefore of the like acceptance: Levit. 14. 22, 30, 31, 32.
Look what he is able; according to his ability; even what his hand is able
to reach unto; and it shall be accepted. Luke 21. 1, 2, 3.
The Poor Widows two mites were as acceptable to God, as the largest
offerings of the richest. (...). Greg. Naz. in Iul. exact.
He measures the gift not by the worth or the greatness of it, but by the
might and the mind only of the giver. And 2 Cor. 9. 12.
if there be in a man a willing mind, says the Apostle, it is accepted not
according to what he has not, but according to what he has. God regards
in his not so much what they should, as what they can and are willing to do.
And Quicquid vis and non potes, factum Deus reputat. Aug. apud Joan. de Tambac.
in consol. Theolog.
what thou would do but can not do, says Augustine, God accounts as
done.

4. Reason 4.
That it is not so much our inherent righteousness in regard of the worth,
dignity, and excellency of it, much less in regard of any purity and
perfection in it, but Si proprie appellantur ^a quae dicim^^ merita nostra,
sunt spei quaedam seminaria, charitatis incentive, occult^ praedestinationis
indicia, futurae glorificationis praesagia. Bern. de great. and lib. arb.
as it is a fruit of Gods love, a token of his favor, a sign and mark of our
adoption and justification, and a pledge and pawn of our future glorification,
that is the ground and matter of our joy: not it self so much, as that, that
it gives us assurance of.

1. Respect 1.
As it is a sign and seal of our Adoption. For our Regeneration whereby this
righteousness is restored, wrought and begun in us, does ratify and seal up
our adoption unto us. Since that 1 Ioh. 3. 1, 3, 6.
none are the children of God by adoption, but those that are so also by
regeneration. And Ioh. 1. 12, 13.
all that are so by regeneration, are by adoption also such. The least and
lowest degree therefore of sincere and sound Ro^. 8. 13, 14, 16.
sanctification being an effect and fruit of regeneration, is a certain sign
of adoption, and may minister a sure argument to him that has it, that he is
the adopted child of God. Now Patria^ amat quisque, non quia magna, sed quia
sua. Se. epist. 66. Sic and prolem.
as parents love their children, not so much for their wit or comeliness, or
the like qualities, as because they are theirs; So does God love his Children,
even because they are his Children: yea Ezech. 16. 4, 5, 6. Si non dilexisset
inimicos, m^nquam possedisset amicos: sicut nec qu^s diligeret, essent, si non
dilexisset, qui nondum erant. Bern. in Cant. 20. Qui neminem bonu^ invenit,
neminem salvat, nisi quem praevenit, Ide^ de great. and lib. arb.
had he not loved them before they had any good quality in them, for which he
might affect them, they had never come to have any such. And as Parents affect
as well, and Fructuosior est adolescentia liberorum, sed infantia dulcior. Sen.
epist. 9.
delight as much in their little young ones as in those that be well grown or
at man's estate, as well in those that are not able to earne the bread that they
eat, as in those that are able to do them the best service: Quis tam iniquam
censuram inter suos agit, ut filium sanum quam aegram magis diligat? procerumve
and excelsum quam brevem and modicum? Foetus suos non distinguunt ferae; and se
in alimentum pariter omnium sternunt: aves ex aequo partiuntur cibos. Sen.
epist. 66. Pater liberos non rejicit, quod aegroti, claudi, debiles, deformes
sint; sed chariores habet and mollius tractat, imperfecti^is infirmitatisque

nor is any father so unnatural, that because his child being weak and
wearish, sickly and cra^ie, as being full of bleach or some other such like
troublesome infirmity, is in regard thereof somewhat waspish and way-ward,
especially being a good natured and a dutiful child otherwise, will for that
cause the less either regard or affect it: no, we are wont rather to be the
Quorsum haec ut scias virtutem omnia opera sua, velut foetus suos ijsdem oculis

more affectionate toward them, and the more tender and charie of them, when it
is so with them. Yea, I say not, what infirmity, but what disease almost is
there so loathsome, as will keep a mother from tendering and tending her
child? In like manner is it with our heavenly Father, whose love and affection
to his goes infinitely beyond the love and affection of any earthly father or
mother whatsoever. For, Psalm. 103. 13.
as a Father, says the Psalmist, is pitiful unto his children; so is the Lord
pitiful to those that fear him. And Esai. 49. 15.
the most natural mother, the kindest and tenderest parent that is, may sooner
forget or not regard the fruit of her own body, than he can forget or not
regard them. And, Malac. 3. 17.
I will spare them, says he, that fear me, and think on my name, as a man
spares his own Son that serves him. He loves and delights in his
little Ezekiel. 34. 16. Esai. 40. 11. Non agnamve sinu p^igeat, foetumve capell^
Desertum oblita matre referr^ dom^^. Tibull. eleg. 1.
weak ones, his nouices, his young 1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.
babes in Christ, that can scarce almost creep, much less go well alone yet,
as well as in his great ones, his strong, his well grown ones, that are able
to help and to tend others. For Psalm. 147. 11.
the Lords delight is in all those that fear him, and that rely upon his
mercy. He is content to accept of at their hands what they are able. As a
little done by a Son, gives his Father much better contentment, than a great
deal more done by a mere stranger or a servant. And there is the difference
between a Son and a Servant; that a Servant if he cannot do his Masters
work, 1 Samuel 30. 13.
his Master will not keep him, he must go seek him some other service;
whereas a Son, albeit he be not able to do ought, yet John 8. 35.
he is not therefore cast off; his Father keeps him not for the service that
he does or can do him, but he keeps him because he is his Son. Yea it is not
the wants and infirmities and imperfections, or the remainders of sin and
corruption in Gods children, that can cause God to cast them off or to abhor
them. Peccata nobis no^ nocent, si non placent. Aug. de temp. 181. Et apud
Joan. de Tambac. in consol. Theolog.
Our corruptions shall not hurt us, if they do not please us, says Augustine.
Nor is it so much our corruptions as our pleasing of our selves in them that
makes God to be displeased with us. Any beginning of sincere sanctifying grace
then argues Gods Child; and a weak Child of God being yet a Child of God,
as well as a strong, has good cause and great cause therein to rejoice.

2 Respect 2.
This Iustitia inchoata, non consummata.
inchoate Righteousness, or (...). Romans 8. 23.
first fruits of Gods Spirit, is as a sure sign and seal of Justification and
Adoption, (for 1 Cor. 6. 11. and 1. 30.
Justification also and Sanctification are never sundred or severed; all that
are truly justified are sincerely sanctified; and all that are sincerely
sanctified, are truly justified also:) so is it a firm pledge and pawn, or
Arra potius quam pignus, quia pignus redditur, arra retinetur. Hieron, in Ephesians.
1. 14. Aug. de verb. Ap. 13. and de visione Dei, apud Bed^m in Ephesians.
earnest rather, of future glorification, and of whatsoever of Gods gracious
promises remains yet to be made good. Christ is, as I may so say, (...).
Hebr. 7. 22.
the Surety we have for them. He is as Coloss. 2. 14.
our Surety to God, for the discharge of our debt: so Gods Surety to us, for
the performance of his promises. And Gods Spirit in the graces of it, is the
earnest that he has given us already beforehand, for the better assurance of
what is to follow. 2 Cor. 1. 20.
All the promises of God are in Christ, Yea and Amen, that is, firm and
stable, says the Apostle. And, 2 Cor. 1. 21, 22.
It is God that establishes us with you in him; who has also anointed, and
sealed us, and put the earnest of his Spirit in our hearts. And Ephesians. 1. 13,
14.
this holy Spirit of Promise, wherewith we are anointed and sealed, is the
earnest of the inheritance by Christ purchased for us, for assurance of
possession. As a penny therefore given in earnest binds as firmly as a pound;
if the party at least be a sure and sufficient man that one deals with: so
even the smallest measure of sincere grace being Gods own earnest, binds him
in regard of his promise accompanying it, (for Nam, ut Iurisconsulti, pignus
donum est verbo vestitum. Nec potest esse sine pacto pignus.
without some such word of agreement and promise, it could not be an earnest:)
to the making good of all his gracious promises, made to the faithful in
general, to those that have received it in particular; and may as well
therefore 2 Thessalonians. 2. 16.
minister good hope, and give undoubted assurance of the performance thereof
unto them in due time. And as a weak, but a true Faith, may as well lay hold
upon Christ, and receive him by God offered it, as well as a strong; as Fides
licet exigua and infirma, accipit nibilominus quae largitur Deus: haud secus ac
pu^rulus parvula, velscabiosa mendicus manu, ille panem, hic stipe^ porreclam
accipit, perinde ac si major aut sanior esset. Spin, de Ius^itia Christ.
a feeble and a shaking hand may as well receive a Kings alms, as the lustiest
and the ablest man's hand that is: So even a weak beginning of saving and
sanctifying Grace, if it can be discerned and discried amids a multitude of
wants, may as well give assurance both of present grace and favor, and of
future glory with God, as the greatest measure that may be. And as a piece of
Gold that such a poor sick man's weak hand receives of the Kings gift, may
as much glad him at the heart, stand him in as much stead, and do him as much
good, as that that is received with a better: So Gods gift by a weak Faith
received and apprehended, may as well comfort a man's soul, and as well joy him
at the heart, being it may stand him in as much stead, and be as beneficial to
him for his good, as being received by a stronger. Yea, the maine and
principal matter of our joy here, being grounded upon not so much what we have
already, as what we Romans 5. 2. and 12, 12.
hope for, and shall have: though a piece of gold be better worth, and a man
therefore may do more good with it, than he can with a small piece of silver,
yet the latter may altogether joy a man as much as the former, in regard of the
inheritance that is assured unto him by either: So a poor quantity of Grace,
though it cannot for the present so much benefit a man, either to do so much
good to him, or to others by him, as a richer and larger portion of grace may;
yet in regard of the heavenly inheritance and future glory, that it is an
earnest of, the one may well minister as much joy as the other, because the one
gives good assurance of the very selfsame in effect and substance with the
other.

Every sincere Christian then, be he weak or strong, has much matter and good
ground of joy. Psalm. 64. 10. and 30. 11.
Let all, says the Psalmist, that are vpright-hearted, rejoice. But

The Hypocrite has no cause ^o rejoice.

As Simon Peter told Simon Magus, Act. 8. 21.
Thou have no part nor portion in this business, for thine heart is not
upright in Gods sight: Branch 2.
So the Hypocrite has no part nor share in the Joy of the Just, Obseruat. 5.
because he is not vpright-hearted, his heart is not single nor sincere in Gods
sight. Job 20. 7.
The joy of the Hypocrite is but momentanie, says Zophar in Job; it is no
true, no sound, no permanent Joy. As their repentance is, so is their
rejoicing: as their godliness is, so is their Joy. As Matthew. 6. 16.
they repent in the face, but not in the heart: So 2 Cor. 5. 12.
rejoice they may in the face, but not in the heart. As their godliness is all
in outward show, nothing in substance nor in truth, and (...). Greg. Naz. Nihil
fictum diuturnum, Ambr. offic. l. 2. c. 22. Caduca sunt, quaecunque fucata
sunt. Cyprian. ad Donat. Ficta omnia celeriter tanquam flosculi decid^nt; nec
simulatum potest quicquam esse diuturnu^. Cic. offic. l. 1.
therefore it is of no constancy at all, of no continuance.( Hosh. 6. 4.
Thy goodness, says God, is as a morning cloud, that is dissolved as soon as
the Sun breaks forth, and as the dew, that melts and is dried up, as
soon as the Sun shines on it.) So is their joy only a superficial, a
seeming rejoicing, and it shall not therefore last long, but it shall fade and
fail soon, as their goodness and godliness does.

And no marvel:

For, 1. Reason 1.
Whence arises the joy here spoken of? Yea, whence springs all true, sound
and constant joy, but as before was showed, Romans 3. 1, 2.
from the present Hinc (...), the joy of Faith. Philip. 1. 25.
assurance of Gods favor here, and Hinc (...), the joy or glorying of hope.
Heb. 3. 6. Spes justorum laetisia. Pro. 10. 28.
the hopeful expectation of eternal happiness hereafter? But the Hypocrite
has neither Faith nor Hope, neither Faith that may give him assurance of the
one, nor Hope that may put him in expectation of the other. No Faith, no such
Faith at least, as may give assurance of Gods favor. For the Faith that does
that, must be (...). 1 Timothy 1. 5. 2 Timothy 1. 5.
a Faith without hypocrisy, a Faith unfeigned: And how can his Faith be without
hypocrisy, when he himself is but an hypocrite. No Hope, such at least as is
certain and Romans 5. 5.
vnfaileable, such as is the Hope that is Hebr. 11. 1.
founded on Faith unfeigned. For Job 27. 8. (...). Antipho. de choreut.
What hope can the Hypocrite have, though he have heaped up never so much,
says Job, when God snatcheth away his soul. Prove. 14. 32. Improbi dum spirant
sperant: justus ctia^ cum expirat, sperat. (...). Basil. Sell. hom. 4.
The just man has hope even in Death, says Solomon. But then do the
Hypocrites hopes fail him, if not before, Prove. 11. 7. (...). Theocrit. Batto.
(...). Eurip. Troad.
When he dies, says Solomon, his hopes all die with him. Psalm. 4. 6, 7.
Where no Hope then, no joy: where no Faith, no Hope: and the Hypocrite
therefore having neither Faith, nor sure Hope, cannot have any sound joy.

2. Reason 2.
In the light of Gods countenance is the Joy of the Godly. Psalm. 89. 15, 16.
Blessed are they, says Ethan, that walk in the light of thy Countenance, O
Lord: such may indeed continually rejoice in thy Name. But the Hypocrite as he
cannot delight in God, so he can have no list to come into Gods sight, much
less to walk before him, or in the light of his face, as those do, and well
may, that are upright. For Job 27. 10, Est and talium poena Deus. Luxestenim.
Etquid talibus ta^ invisum? ^erm. de consid. l. 5.
how can the Hypocrite, says Job, delight himself in the All-sufficient? Or
what heart can he have at all times to call upon God? Or consequently to depend
upon him? And again, Job 13. 15, 16.
Though God slay me, yet will I trust in him; and I will approve my ways in
his sight: (to wit, for the integrity, for the sincerity of them:) And he
shall be my Savior and my salvation; when the hypocrite shall not dare to
appear in his presence. And indeed with what confidence can any hypocrite
appear before God, when though he may delude man, yet he cannot beguile God?
For 1 Samuel 16. 7. (...). Plut. de sera vindict.
God sees not as man sees: Man sees the face, but God sees the heart.
(There is no deluding of him with vain shows, no more than cozening of Sapiens
num^ularius Deus est: num^^um fictum n^ recipiet. Bern. de grad. obed.
a skillful Mint-man with counterfeit coin.) When all that they do is most
loathsome and abominable in Gods sight? When all their masked devotion is so
far from pacifying Gods wrath, that it is but a means rather to aggrauate
and exasperate it against them? For Job 36. 13. Nem^ enim magis iram meretur,
quam amicu^ simulans inimicus. Bern. de convers. c. 27.
the hollow-hearted, says Elihu, do but heap up and increase wrath. What joy
can the hypocrite then have to come into that light, Ephesians. 5. 13. John 3. 19,
20.
that discovers his hypocrisy, that lays open his deceit? Job. 24. 16, 17.
The light, says Job, is as the shadow of Death to such. Or what assurance can
hypocrisy give of Gods favor, when there is nothing that does more than it
procure his displeasure? Matthew. 24. 51.
His Lord will give him his portion with hypocrites, says our Savior, when he
would intimate that such an one should most severely be punished.

3. Reason 3.
Is righteousness the root of joy? Romans 14. 17.
Righteousness, and peace, and joy, says the Apostle. And does joy spring
from righteousness? Then can the hypocrice have no true joy, because he has
no true righteousness. For as counterfeit coin is no coin; nor will in
payment go as current for the procuring of ought to him that has it; so
counterfeit righteousness is in deed and truth no righteousness, nor will to
any good purpose stand him that has it in stead. Yea as Romans 10. 3. Apoc. 3.
17. (...). Greg. Naz. apolog. Nemo est illo insanabilior, qui sibi saus
videtur. Greg. in Psalm. poen. 4. Puto multos ad sapientiam pervenire potuisse,
nisi se put^ssent jam pervenisse. Sen. de tranq. c. 1.
he is farthest off from attaining to righteousness that supposes himself to
have it when indeed he has not: so is that man farthest off from being indeed
righteous, that makes show of being such when he is indeed nothing less.
Simulata sanctitas, duplex iniquitas, Gregor. a Tambac. and aliis citatus.
Simulata aequitas non est aequitas, sed duplex iniquitas: quia and iniquitas
est, and simulatio. Aug. in Psalm. 63.
Dissembled holiness, says that ancient Father, is double ungodliness. For
it is one point of ungodliness for a man not to be godly; and another point of
it, being not godly, to make show of being such; and shall therefore have
Matthew. 23. 14.
a double share in Gods wrath. And Malus ubi bonum se simulat, tunc est
pessimus. P. Sir. Aperte quando malus est, tunc est optimus. Nam, Bonitatis
verba imnari major est malitia. Idem.
a wicked man, says the Heathen man, is then worst when he seems best; he
is never worse than when he makes show to be that which he is not. If there
can be no sound rejoicing then, where righteousness is not; no hypocrite
being most unrighteous can ever soundly rejoice. Use.


Now the only Use of this Point (passing by all other) shall be, Exhortation
to Examination.
to stir us up every one diligently and seriously to examine himself whether
his heart be sincere and upright with God or no, that so he may come to know
whether he have part or no in this Joy, whether he have good and just cause or
no to rejoice.

This the rather should we be content, and it stands us upon, to take the
more pains in, because there is much deceit and delusion, yea and collusion
too, Motive.
in this kind.

2 Cor. 2. 11.
Satan is full of wiles. Deceit 1.
And Ierem. 17. 9.
our own heart also is exceeding deceitful. Many there be that Iam. 1. 26.
beguile themselves, and Gal. 6. 3.
think themselves to be somewhat, yea to be great ones, (as Simon Magus gave
himself out to be, (...). Act. 8. 9.
some great one,) when indeed they are just nothing, but Apoc. 3. 17.
are most miserably deluded. Deceit 2.
And there is (...). Chrysostom. tom. 6. orat. 67. Initium salutis notitia
peccali. Epicur. Nam qui peccare se nescit, corrigi non vult. Deprehendas te
oportet, aniequa^ emendes. Sen. ep. 28.
no means whereby Satan keeps more out of Gods way, than by bearing them in
hand, and making them believe that they are in it already.

And again on the other side, many think they have not that which indeed they
have. For Iam ibi sunt, unde non est retro lapsus. Sed hoc illis de se nondum
liquet: and scire se nesciunt. Iam contigit illis bono suo furi, nondum
confidere. Sen. ep. 75.
a man may have grace, and yet not know that he has it; (as the Embruo or the
Infant in the womb has life, and yet knows not that it lives;) yea he may
think that he has it not. As we seek sometime for keys, when they are in
our pocket: and Hayward, Strong Helper, chap. 22. As we are said to have lost a
thing, when we know not where it is, though it be safe still in our own
custody.
we think that we have lost some jewel, when we have it safe looked up in our
chest, or in our deske; yea or as the Butcher looks about him for the candle
that sticks in his hat, and he carries about with him on his head, and
seeks it by the light of that which he seeks, as if he had it not about
him, not remembering suddenly where he stuck it. So the godly are often in their
own conceit at a loss, when yet that they deem lost is still sure and safe;
they miss many times Gods grace in them, and seek for this grace by the light
of the same grace, which yet they see not in themselves. And this is another
wile of the Devil, whereby he labors to delude such, by calling in question
their sincerity, as he sometime did Job. 1. 9, 10, 11.
Jobs, and moving, yea making them many times to their great discomfort to
doubt of it, by persuading them that they are out of Gods way, when they are
indeed in it; and out of favor with God, when they are as much in favor with
him as any; that so either he may, if it be possible, make them grow desperate
and careless; or else that he may make the way to the heavenly Canaan as
tedious, toilesome and troublesome unto them as he can, when by no force or
wile of his he is able to push or tice them out of it.

That both sincerity therefore may be discerned, and hypocrisy discovered, to
the consolation of the one, and the confusion of the other: it shall not be
amiss here to annex some Notes, Notes of Sincerity.
whereby those that desire to be truly informed of their estate, may be able to
judge of their own sincerity, and of the uprightness of their heart.

The first Note then of Sincerity may be Universality: Note 1. Universality.
when our repentance and obedience is not partial but general, when we are
careful to shun, not one or two only, this or that sin, but all known
sin whatsoever, and to endeavor our selves to walk in all the good ways of
God, without exception of any. So it is said of Josias, that 2 King. 23. 25.
he turned unto God with all his heart, all his soul, all his mind and his
might, according to all that was contained in the Law. And so says David of
himself, Psalm. 119. 101.
I have refrained my feet, not from one or two, but from every evil way, that
I might keep thy Statutes. And, Psalm. 119. 6.
Then shall I not be confounded, when I have respect unto all thy Precepts.
And, Psalm. 119. 128.
Therefore do I esteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right;
and every wrong way do I even abhor. And hereby does he approve unto God his
sincerity and the uprightness of his heart with God. Psalm. 18. 21, 22, 23.
I have kept the ways of God, and have not wickedly gone away from my God. For
all his Commandments were before me, and I put not any of his Statutes
wilfully away from me: But was upright before him, and kept my self from mine
own sin. And of Zachary and Elizabeth it is said, Luke 1. 6.
They were righteous in Gods sight, walking blamelesly in all Gods
Commandments and Ordinances. For as it is said of Vices, Qui Rabet unum
vitium, habet omnia. Sen. de benef. l. 5. c. 15.
He that has any one of them, has all of them. Stultus omnia vitia habet.
Idem ib. l. 4. c. 27. Omnia omnibus insunt. Malus quisque nullo vitio vacat.
Ibid. c. 26.
A fool, says the Heathen man, is free from no fault. Fraterna enim quadam
sibi copulantur necessitudine tum vitia, tum virtutes. Ambr. de Abra. l. 2. c.
6.
So it is much more true of Virtues, (...). Chrysip. apud Plut. in Stoic.
contr. Qui unam habet, caeteras habet. Sen. ep. 95. Didicimus, cui virtua
aliqua contingat, omnes inesse. Plia. in paneg.
He that has any one of them, has all of them; and consequently, Vt si unam
virtutem confessus sis te non habere, nullam necesse sit te habiturum. Cic.
Tuscul. l. 2.
He has none, that wants any. For Vices indeed are contrary and adverse one
to another; as Hinc Aristot. prior. l. 2. c. 2. (...). Ex falsis falsum,
veru^que aliquando scquetur: Ex veris possunt non nisi vera scqui.
Falsehood is to Falsehood, though Truth never to Truth. (...). Aristot. ethic.
l. 2. c. 6. Virtus est medium vitiorum, and utrinque reductum. Horat. epist.
18. l. 1.
Vices are Extremes, Virtue is the Mean. And (...). Aristot. ibid. c. 8.
Bonum malo contrarium est, malum and bono and malo.
Extremes cross either other, as well as the Mean. And therefore De vitijs
ambigitur: quia and virtuti uni vitia duo opponuntur; and vitium vitio
^ollitur. Aug. epist. 29.
of them there is some doubt made (though See the Spiritual Watch, Point 2..
20. and Aquin. infra.
there need not) by some: but Constans scitum Philosophorum, Inseparabilitas
virtutum. Aug. ibid.
of the other it is generally agreed by all; that as he says of Habent arts
omnes commune quoddam vinculum, and cognatione quadam continentur. Cic. pro
Ar^h.
Arts and Sciences, so moral (...). Chrysip. apud Plut. and Zeno apud Laert.
(...). Stoici apud Sto^. Virtutes individuas esse, and inter se connexas, Apul.
de Philos. Individuus est virtutu^ comitatus. Se^. ep. 68. Omnes inter se nexae
and coniugatae sunt. Cic. ^uscul. l. 3. Sic copulatae connexaeque sunt
virtutes, ut omnes omnium participes fint: nec alia ab alia possit separari,
Idem de fin. l. 5. Connexae sibi sunt concatenataeque virtutes, etiamsi vulgi
opinione sejunctae; ut qui unam habet, plures habere videatur. Ambr. offic. l.
2. c. 9. and in Luc. c. 6. Et cognatae sibi invicem sunt virtutes. Idem offic.
l. 1. 27.
Virtues much more, have a kind of consanguinitie and natural nearenesse
between them; they are tied in such an indissoluble band together, that they
cannot possibly be severed or disioyned one from another. And therefore Non
singula vitia ratio, sed omnia pa^iter prostern^t; in universum semel vincit.
Sen. ad Helv. c. 13.
any one Virtue, where it enters, expels all Vice, Virtus ergo ubi una
ingressa fuerit, quoniam secum caeteras ducit, vitia ibi cadunt omnia. Aug. ep.
29. ^rudentia enim nec ignava, nec injusta, nec intemperans esse potest:
Fortitudo nec injusta, nec imprudens, nec intem perans, etc. Aug. ibid. and
Ambr. offic. l. 1. c. 27. and l. 2. c. 9. and Greg. mor. l. 21. c. 1. Nec
veraullavirius esl, simixtavirtutibus aliis nonest. Ibid. l. 1. c. 39.
because no one Virtue ever enters alone, but it brings ever in somewhat of
each other Virtue with it. Nor is it so in Moral Virtues only, as they are
commonly termed; but it is so in Spiritual Graces also. There is Coloss. 3.
12. 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7, 9.
a Concatenation as well of the one, as of the other; they are so inseparably
lincked and chained together in an holy band, in a divine league, that Vna sine
aliis nulla est. Greg. mor. l. 21. c. 1.
one cannot, nor will not be without the other. And therefore 1 Cor. 1. 7. Iam.
1. 4.
every true Christian has each sanctifying Grace in some measure. Perkins on
Matthew. 5. 48.
As a Child, so soon as it is borne, is a perfect man for integrity of parts
and entirenesse of limbs, though not for bigness and bulk of body: So every
good Christian that is indeed truly John 1. 13. 1 Pet. 1. 23.
regenerate, is no sooner soundly converted, but he is in part A new man in
every one. Ephesians. 4. 23, 24. Coloss. 3. 10.
renewed in all parts, and has in some degree or other a beginning of all
Christian Grace, though he be not any thing yet near his Ephesians. 4. 13, 15.
due and full growth in any: And Qui unam habet, omnes habet: and qui unam non
habet, nullam habet. Aug. ep. 29. In quo aliqua harum principalis est virtus,
in eo etiam caeterae praesto sunt: quiae ipsae sibi sunt connexae concreaeque
virtutes. Ambr. de parad. c. 3.
he has not any as yet consequently, if he wholly want any: As also on the
other side again, if he have any one spiritual Grace, he is in some degree
freed from An old man put off. Ephesians. 4. 22. Coloss. 3. 9, 8. (...).
every spiritual Vice. For Quod sonitas in corpore, sanctitas in cord. Bern.
de diverse. 16.
as Health is in the body, so is Grace in the Soul. Sicut ad corporis
sanitatem non est satis, ut peste quis, vel pleuritide careat, sed ab omnibus
in universum morbis immune esse oportet: Sic ad animi sanitatem requiritur
sordium ac vitiorum omnium in universum abdicatio. Spin. de just. Christ.
As Health freeth from all diseases, according to the degree of it: (for Vise
Galenum de sanit. tuend. lib. 1. contra Erasist^ati sententiam agentem.
in it also there are degrees:) So sanctifying Grace freeth from all Vices that
are contrary thereunto, according to the measure and proportion of it. Non est
cardiacus (Craterum dixisse putato) Hic aeger: recte est igitur, surgetque?
negabit; Quod latus aut renes morbo teneaniur a^uto. Horat. sermon. ^. 2. c. 3.
Nor is a man therefore said to be in good health, so long as any one disease
holds him and hangs on him; Leprosus si parle ulla tantum sit immundus,
extra castra obligatur. Hesych. in Levit. l. 4. c. 13.
nor clean, while the Leprosy possesses any one part of him: nor a Saint,
(and yet 1 Cor. 1. 2. and 6. 10, 11.
such an one is every true Christian) Romans 6. 2, 6, 7, 12, 14.
so long as any Vice, what ever it be, rules and reigns in him, or he
wilfully lies and lives in any one Sin.

Again, as it is in Christian Graces; so (...). Eustath. in ascet. Et ex eodem
Simeon Magist. homil. 1.
is it also in Gods Commandments. Lex tota est una copulat^va. Illyric. in
Clav. Script. and in Gloss. N. T.
The whole Law, say they well in the Schools, is one Copulative. The Law for
the sanction indeed is disjunctive; for the Iniunction it is Copulative. The
sanction runs in the Disjunctive, Esai. 1. 19, 20. Deuteronomy. 28. 15, 58, 59.
Either do thus, or die: the Iniunction in the Copulative, not, either do this
or that; but, Do both this, and that too. Mark. 12. 33. I. (...). 10. 27.
Love God above all, and thy Neighbor as thy self. Decalog. Exodus 20. 2-17.
Deu. 5. 6-21, 33.
Take the true God alone for thy God: and worship him according to his Will:
and use his Name reverently, and Sanctify his Sabbaths, etc. And therefore
says our Savior to the Pharisees, Matthew. 23. 23.
These things ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone.
Now it is a Rule in the Art of Reasoning, that In omni conjuncto, sive
copulato, si unis est mendacium, etiamsi vera sint caetera, tota esse mendacuim
dicitur. Ex omnibus vero quae disiunguntur, unum esse verum sufficit. Gell.
noct. Attic. l. 16. c. 8. Verum enunciati copulati judicium pendet ex omniu^
partium veritate; falsum salie^ ex una part falsa. Ram. dialect. l. 2. c. 5.
in a Disjunctive, if any one part hold, the whole is held to be true; in the
Copulative, if any one part hold not, the whole is held to be untrue. So in a
Disjunctive Iniunction, if a man perform the one part, he is freed thereby
from the other; the Woman that was enjoined to bring for her Purification
Levit. 12. 8. Luke 2. 14.
a pair either of Turtles, or of Pigeons, was thereby bound to bring the one
only, she needed not to bring both: and in the legal sanction, Ezekiel. 21. 11.
Galat. 3. 12.
he that does, dies not, Deuteronomy. 27. 27.
he that dies does not; for no man is thereby bound to both, both to do, and
to die, to do the one, and yet to endure also the other. But in a Copulative
Iniunction it is far otherwise; Delinquens in part, in totum reus est. Regula
generalis, Gloss. ad Digest. l. 29. tit. 5. l. 3. Si quis unu^ custodiat, and
reliqua praevaricetur, nihil ei prodest. Amb. in Psalm. 118. sermon. 13. and
Hesych. in Levit. l. 4. c. 13.
nothing is done to any purpose, if a man observe not every part: It is as in a
Lease that is grounded upon many conditions, ten or twenty suppose, any one of
them not observed, make a forfeiture of the whole. He is Deuteronomy. 27. 27.
accursed that persisteth not in every thing contained in the Law of God to
fulfill it. And Ezekiel. 18. 10, 11, 13.
though he do not all these things, says God by the Prophet, if he do but
any (...). Marc. de leg. spir. 135. (...). Plutarch. sympos. probl. lib. 7.
cap. 5.
one of them, because he has done any of these (...), (for sol take it, the
words would be read) he shall die. Yea, Saint James therefore goes further,
and sticks not to affirm, Iam. 2. 10.
That whosoever keeps the whole Law, but fails only in one point, he is
guilty of the whole. Which words of his yet are not so to be taken Hi^on.
contr. Pelag. l. 1.
as if Quod in ^scet. Eustath. (...). Et (...) Logoth. sermon. de virt, and vit.
a man in stealing did break the Commandment of not committing adultery, or
in telling a lie, the Commandment of sanctifying the Sabbath: or "Dod on the
Decalogue.
as if a man that did at any time of infirmity sin against any one
Commandment of God, (as 1 King. 8. 46. (...). Crates apud Laert.
who does not lam. 3. 1.
often, even 1 John 1. 8, 10.
the holiest that is?) did stand guilty in Gods sight as a wicked wretch, and
one that had no regard at all of any. But his meaning is, that that man that
would seem to make conscience of keeping all the Commandments of God save
one, but makes no conscience, or has no care of keeping that one, Nisi enim
attenti fuerimus in (...) mandatis ejus, fuerintque alia praeterita, alia pro
voluntate observata, rectum justificationis ordinem (...) tenemus. Hilar. in
Psalm. 118. Nulli siquidem (...) licet, ex his quae (...) eligere pro arbitria,
and quod placuerit assi^^ere, quod displicu^^it repudiare; and (...) ex (...),
ex p^rte contemnere, Si enim pro arbitria suo servi Dominis obtemper (...)
quidem in (...). de provid. l. 3.
does not indeed and truth, whatsoever he may pretend or seem to do, make
conscience of any, no not of those that in that manner he seems to observe.
The reason that the Apostle adds there is indeed very forcible. It is Iam, 2.
11.
the same God that enacted and delivered the whole Law, that has enjoined one
good duty as well as another, has inhibited one sinful act as well as
another. If a man therefore for Conscience of Gods will and word, do exercise
himself in any one good duty, he will consequently exercise himself in all
other good duties that concern him; because the same God in his Word has
alike enjoined all. If for Conscience of Gods will and Word he forbear or
abhor any one sin, O^^em odit iniquitatem, qui habet hanc gratiam. Bern.
Qui autem omnem viam iniquitatis odit, ad universa Dei praecepta corrigitur and
eme^datur. Ambr. in Psalm. 118.
he will for conscience of the same word and will of God, forbear and abhor
all other Sins; because the sa^e God in his Word has alike forbidden all.
And on the contrary therefore, he that does not either exercise himself in
every known duty that concerns him of the one sort, or is not careful to
shun every kind of evil act of the other sort, does not either observe
ought in the one kind, or eschew ought in the other kind, out of any true
care or conscience of his duty and obedience to God, but for some other
by-ends and by-respects. It is a good Rule in the Schools, Vbi unu^ aliquod
peccatu remittitur, ibi omnia remittuntur. Impossible est unum sine aliis
remitti. Thom. Aquin. sum. p. 3. q. 86. a. 3.
He that has any one sin remitted, has all sins remitted: And so,
Peccata quamuis non sint connexa quantum ad conversionem ad bonu^ commutabile,
sunt tamen quantum ad aversionem a bono incommutabili: and in hac part habent
rationem offensae, quam per poenitentiam oportet tolli. Aquin. ibid.
He that has sincerely repented of any one sin, has repented him of all.
And he that has not repented him of all known sin, has not repented yet of
any. For what is true Repentance, but Ezekiel. 18. 21, 27, 28, 30, 32. and 33. 11.
a returning again into the right way? And how is it possible for a man to
return into the right way, Psalm. 119. 101. ^ passim Palantes error recto de
tramite pellit. Horat. sermon. l. 2. sat. 3.
as long as he wandereth still in any by-path? Or how can a man repent of this
or that particular sin, because it is contrary to Gods will, or offensive in
his sight, but he must needs withal repent him of whatsoever he knows to be
in like manner a breach of his Law, and a business that he abhors? Nor does
that man indeed study sincerely and out of a love of God to please him in any
thing, that does not, as the Apostle Paul prays in the behalf of the
Colossians, endeavor and strive Coloss. 1. 10.
to fructify in every good work, that he may please the Lord in all things,
Quando servus ex Domini sui jussis ea facit tantummodo quae vult, jam no^
Dominicam implet voluntate^, sed suam. Salvian. de provid. l. 3.
He does not Gods will, says Saluian well, but his own will, that does it no
further than himself will: that does not by laboring with the Apostle Paul,
to keep "Hebr. 13. 18.
a good conscience in all things, 2 Cor. 5. 9, 11. and 6. 4.
endeavor to approve himself and his courses unto God, as well in some things
as in others. This Universality therefore of care and endeavor is a good
Argument of Sincerity. As on the other side it is a shrewd sign of
unsoundness and insinceritie, Sciendum quia quisquis virtute aliqua pollere
creditur, tunc veraciter pollet, cum vitijs ex aliqua part non subjacet. Greg.
m^r. l. 21. c. 1.
when men will seem to make conscience of performance of some good duties, and
yet are wholly careless and regardlesse of others: or when they will seem to
make conscience of the forbearance of some sins, and yet lie and live in the
ordinary practice of others, which yet they cannot be so ignorant as not to
know, or so unmindful, as not to consider to be sins. Thus was Herod's
hypocrisy detected and discovered. He stood in some awe of John, knowing him
to be a very holy man: and because he would be esteemed religious, and would
seem to respect him, Mark. 6. 20.
he heard him often, and at his motion did many good things: yea and it is like
enough that he outwardly reformed many things amiss, that John found fault
with, either in his Court, or in himself. But yet he would not leave the
keeping of his Brothers wife for all that; and therefore Mark. 6. 17.
when John began to deal plainly with him in that point, he then brake off
all, and committed John toward; and made it evidently appear thereby, that all
his former reformation and well-doing, was but in show only, and for other
ends. And hereby also was Iehues zeal descried to be unsound. He made a great
show a while of zeal for God and his worship: and 2 King. 10. 16.
Ionadab must needs along with him and see it. He was zealous 2 King. 10. 28.
against Baal, that was 1 King. 16. 31, 32, 33.
the ruin of Ahabs house, and 2 King. 10. 11.
against Ahabs house, which it was (...). Aristot. rhet. l. 1. c. 15. and
Herod. Clio. and Philip. M^ced.
not for his safety, as he thought, to let stand, or to leave any remainder
of: but 2 King. 10. 31.
he gave way to the Calves, though no less abominable in Gods sight, and as
dishonorable unto him, because 1 King. 12. 27, 28.
that seemed to be the stay of his estate. And so he showed thereby that all
his Piety was no better than mere Policy; and that he sought but his own
ends in either. And in like manner when men and women shall be content to
reform their lives, and conform themselves to the will and word of God in
some things, but stand out wilfully in some other things, refusing to practice
the like reformation, or to show the like conformity in them, albeit they be
in heart and conscience convinced of their duty therein, it is an evident
Argument of unsoundness.

A second Note of Sincerity is Uniformity. Note 2. Uniformity.
As an Universality, so an uniformity in well doing: when a man keeps
Virtutem oftendit constantia, and omnium inter se actionu^ concordia; quando
idem semper quis est, and in omni actu par sibi. Sen. epist. 120. Tunc directae

an equable tenor in his courses and carriage, not strict in some things, and
slack in other, though, it may be, not wholly regardlesse of them; but holds
an even hand generally in his care and observance of things enjoined him by
God. "1 Timothy 5. 21. No^ est justa causatio, cur praeferuntur aliqua ubi
facienda sunt omnia. Salvia^. de provid. l 3.
I charge thee, says the Apostle to Timothy, that thou observe all these
things, without preferring one before another, and that thou do nothing
partially. And says David, as before, Psalm. 119. 128. True Christianity
esteems all alike. Greenham in Psalm. 119.
I have all thy Precepts concerning all things in esteem; and I forbear not
only, but even abhor all wicked ways. And again, Psalm. 119. 104.
By thy Commandments I get understanding; and therefore I abhor not some one
or two, but each wicked way. His Zeal was not partial, but indifferently
against all. And it is (...). Psalm. 119. 139. (...). ^ustath. in ascetis. l. 2.

an evident sign, says one of the Ancients, that our Zeal is of God, when
in like manner we find our selves alike affected in regard of all sin,
whatsoever God may be dishonored by, as well in one kind as in another.

But on the other side, when men will seem wonderful earnest and eager for
the observation of some of Gods ordinances, marvelous strict and precise in
the keeping of some precepts, extreme fiery in their opposition against some
enormities, excessive in their hatred and detestation of some sins, yea
sometime but supposed sins, even to (...). Greg. Naz. in apolog.
the abhorring of men's persons for them; but have nothing the like intention of
zeal and fervor in other matters, though of as great moment, or against other
sins, though no less heinous than those; albeit they will not seem wholly
careless or altogether regardlesse either of the one or of the other: And
especially when men will seem to be so double diligent in less matters,
things of ceremony and circumstance only, when they are but negligent the
whiles in far greater; very strait-laced in the one, but ouer-loose-girt in the
other: It is a shrewd argument that their hearts are not upright in either: but
that they are carried away with (...). Plut. de iracund. (...). Ide^ de
tranquil.
some corrupt humor or other, self-love, or emulation, or vainglory, or the
like, that shrowdeth it self in the habit of piety and zeal. Thus our
Savior discovered the hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees in his time.
Matthew. 23. 23. Luke 11. 42.
Woe be unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, says our Savior; for you
tithe Mint and Anise, and Cumin, and every kind of Potherbe; but judgment,
mercy, fidelity, and the weightier things of the Law ye neglect; Matthew. 23.

even of trifles; (wherein they shall one day rise in judgment against not a

condemn them therein, though themselves to be condemned) and in some other
like businesses of lesser moment; but in other matters more weighty they
showed nothing the like strictness, and are by our Savior therefore censured
for no better than hollow-hearted hypocrites. And assuredly as inequality of
the pulse argues much distemper in the body; so this ineq^alitie of carriage
argues little soundness in the soul. Ea vero non est religio sed
dissimulatio, quae per omnia non conslat sibi. Author de duplici Martyrio.
It is no true religion or piety, but dissimulation and hypocrisy, that is
not in all things like it self; says an Author that pretends to be Cyprian,

not, speaking of some that were very nice and curious, even to some taint and
spice of superstition, of but touching an Image, or tasting ought that had any
seeming reference to an Idol; but were ouer-loose and careless of their
carriage otherwise. Every true Christian as he is renewed in part in all parts,
so he has a kind of proportionable growth in each part, as Ephesians. 4. 16.
the Apostle speaks of the mystical body of Christ in general. As he is
not as a maimed person, one that wants tongue, or legs, or hands, or some
other limbs, but as one that has a whole entire organicall body: So he is
not as a monster, (...). de Cancro Poeta apud Plut. de adulat. E^ de Papavere

one that has the Head or Hand, Back or Belly bigger than the whole Body
besides, but has a comely symmetry of each part with part. As there are W.
Bradsh^w.
no Dwarfes in Christ's Body, none that grow not at all, but stand ever at a
stay: So in the Christian soul no Grace does so stand at a stay while the rest
grow, much less do they all so stand at a stay, while some one grows, that
any one should so excessiuely outstrip all the rest, Vt membri unius totus homo
quasi lacinia videatur, uti Petron. in Satyr.
that the rest in regard of it should scarce be seen. Neither is a Christian
man like a new vpstars Courtier, who because he is not able to furnish himself
all over completely at first, is feign to wear his apparel unsuitable in the
several parts of it. Yea rather, as it is an argument of affectation of wealth
when men go well and richly apparelled, in some one part of their apparel,
but have not the rest suitable and correspondent thereunto: so it is an argument
rather of affectation of holiness, than of true holiness indeed, when men are
so unequal and unsuitable in their courses and dispositions, in some one or two
things demeaning themselves as exceedingly restrict, but in many others, or the
most things again as remiss; when their care and conscience in some things,
is not in some sort proportionable and correspondent to that that they make
show of in other things: Nor does the one prove, much less make a man the
richer; nay (...). Plut. de profect.
it hinders rather, and is a means to cast him more behind hand: nor does
the other prove, much less make a man truly religious; nay it hinders
rather, while with a general neglect of growth in, or regard of other good
duties, a man's study and care is wholly set and spent upon some one particular
that he pleases himself in; as where the matter that should nourish and
support the whole body, is conueighed all to some one part, not so much to
feed it, as to feed a wen that grows upon it.

A third Note of Sincerity, Note 3. Vbiquitie.
is Vbiquitie: when a man is in some measure alike in all places, as well Bonus
non fuit, quam malorum pravitas non prohavit. Greg. in Euang. 38. Neque enim
perfect bonus est, nisi qui fuerit and cum malis bonus. Idem in Ezech. l. 1.
ho^. 9.
in bad company as in good, in private as in public, in Church, out of Church,
at home and abroad. To this purpose it is that David says of himself; Psalm.
16. 8.
I have set the Lord always before my face. And, Psalm. 119. 168.
All my ways are in thy sight. As Psalm. 18. 22.
all Gods ways in his sight; so all his ways in Gods sight: and therefore
wheresoever he was, as Prove. 15. 3.
being ever in Gods eye, he endeavored to approve himself unto God. Those
things that are natural follow a man whithersoeuer he goes, and accompany him
constantly wheresoever he become. Coelum, non animum mutant, qui trans mare
currunt. Horat. l. 1. ep. 11. Hinc Socrates; Quid miraris peregrinationes tibi
no^ prodesse, cum te circumser^^ Sen. ep. 28.
Change of place, says the Heathen man, causes not any change of mind. As it
is with the motion of the heart and the lungs in the body; they are of
themselves beating and stirring wheresoever a man is, or whatsoever he is
about, and it is painful to a man therefore to restrain the work of them,
or to hold his breath for any time: so it is a good sign that godliness is
grown to a kind of connaturalnesse with us, when our religious disposition
continues with us in all places, and is in some sort working in us,
wheresoever we are: so that it is with us, as with David it was, who says of
himself, that Psalm. 39. 1, 2, 3.
howsoever he had purposed to forbear speaking of ought that was good while he
was in company with some wicked, and some profane ones were in presence, yet
it was no small pain to him, and he was hardly able to restrain or to
contain himself. It was with him as it was sometime with Jeremy, in somewhat
the like case, but of greater necessity* when he saw what evil entertainment
the word of God found with the most, Ierem. 20. 9, 10.
he had once resolved he says, not to mention Gods Name any more to them; but
he could not for his life keep long that his unwarrantable resolution; Gods
word was as a fire in his breast, and as a flame Strangulat inclusus dolor,

holy things, says our Savior, are not to be offered unto Dogs, nor pearls
cast before Swine. No: we must be wary where and before whom we speak; and
take heed how by our in^iscreet carriage in such kind we wrong religion it
self, and make it ridiculons. But that even Quomod^ de Platone Plut. de
adulat. (...).
among such we retain still a religious disposition; and the restraint of good
employments be grievous unto us, though no necessity lie upon us, as upon
Ierem. 1. 17. 1 Cor. 9. 17.
Jeremy there did, having no just opportunity for such employment at the
present; which may be a means to seal up our sincerity unto us. In like
manner when we shall be religiously affected, not when we are in the Church
only, or about some solemn part of Gods service, (at which time the
solemnity of the action, and the very sight of others enforces a kind of
conformity and outward semblance of holiness on those many times that are
most profane,) but even out of the Church also, and out of Gods solemn
service, even when we are about our ordinary affairs: Nor when we shall be in
the presence only of others, either good or bad, familiars, or strangers, but
when we shall be retired also and alone by our selves.

For a true Christian is, as the Heathen Philosopher says of a good man, like

Sen. ep. 76.
Plaiers that used them, such as acting Princely parts, wear royal apparel,
keep state, and demean themselves gravely and soberly so long as they are in
public view upon the stage; but when they have done acting, are no sooner off
the stage, but they pass presently into another, a clean contrary, habit,
retain neither prince-like behavior nor apparel, but are most beggarly, base
and debauched, either in private by themselves, or among their companions like
themselves: In the Church and public assemblies, carry themselves very
devoutly, and in the presence of others affect a show of religion, but out of
the congregation are far from all show of godliness, or in their private
conversation have little or no care at all of ought in that kind; it is a sure
sign of no soundness at all in such as be Quidam alternis Vatinij; alternis
Catones sunt. Sic maxim coarguitur animus imprudens: alius prodit atque aluis;
and, quo turpius mihil judico, impar sibi est. Sen. ep. 120.
so variously affected: acting like those Stage Players, sometime one part, and
sometime another, as either by others they are assigned them, or as the places
that they are put upon them for the present. Non est vera religio, quae cum
templo relinquitur. Lactant.
It is no true devotion, says Lactantius, that leaves a man at the
Church-doore. Where religion is not showed in the actions of a man's life, in
the course of his calling, as well as in the congregation and in his
Church-seruice, Such Iam. 1. 26. (...).
religion (Saint James says it,) is but vain and unsound. Nor is that
religion any better that affects view and sight, that loves to be seen; (it
was the Pharisees devotion Matthew. 6. 1. and 23. 5.
that did all so as men might see what they did:) that is loud and talkatiue in
company, silent in secret, in presence of others operative, idle in private. As
the Heathen man says of one that Amissum no^ flet, cum sola est, Gellia
patrem: Si quis adest, jusse prosiliunt lachrymae. Martial. epig. 34. lib. 1.
never wept or mourned for her mother, but when there was some body by to see
her; Non dolet hic, quisquis laudari, Gellia, quaerit: Ille dolet vere, qui
sine test dolet. Ibid. Testes doloris quisquis captat, haud dolet.
He mourns not heartily that affects to be seen mourning, and mourns
not therefore but where some may see it: He mourns indeed heartily, that
mourns then when there is none by to take notice of it, and to bear witness
that he mourns. So in this case, he is not sincerely religious, that
affects to have his religion seen, and that never therefore carries himself
religiously, but where others are by to take notice of it: he is truly
religious that is careful to carry himself religiously, and is frequent and
diligent in holy duties, even then when he is alone by himself, as well as
when he is in the presence and company of others; that Sic vive cum hominibus
tanquam Deus videat: sic loquer^ cu^ Deo, tanquam homines audiant. Sen. epist.
10. Praeceptum est Philosophy: Sic loquendum esse cum hominibus, tanquam Dij
audiant; sic cum Dijs tanquam homines audiant Macrob. Saturn. l. 1.
conuerseth so with men, says the Heathen man, as if God ouer-looked him,
communeth with God so even in private, as if men ouer-heard him. And certainly,
howsoever it be true indeed, that Ephesians. 4. 11, 12, 13. Psalm. 29. 9. and 84. 1.
and 84. 7, 10.
the public Service is of exceeding great benefit, and therefore 1 Thessalonians. 5,
20, 21. Psalm. 27. 4. and 122. 1.
highly to be esteemed, as Psalm. 89. 7. Hebr. 4. 12. 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25.
having a more powerful, lively and effectual work of the Spirit in it, and
Matthew. 18. 20. and 28. 20.
a more special blessing of God promised and annexed unto it; in regard
whereof, David though a man 2 Samuel 23. 2.
full of the Spirit of Grace, yet could not during his exilement content
himself with his own private meditations and devotions, but Psalm. 42. 1, 2,
3, 4. and 43. 4. and 63. 1, 2, and 84. 2.
longed exceedingly, and prayed most instantly to have free liberty of access
again to the public assemblies of the Saints: yet when upon a man's sick or
deathbed Satan shall be busy about him, and calling his sincerity in
question, a man may in such case be more comforted, and receive better
assurance of his sincerity, by consideration of his frequencie and diligence
in holy duties in private, because in them there can be least danger or
suspicion of hypocrisy, Matthew. 6. 6, 18.
which none but God and his own soul has been privy unto, than by all that
he has performed either publicly or privately in the presence of others.

A fourth Note Note 4. Perpetuity.
of Sincerity is Perpetuity, Constancy, permanence, continuance: when we are
not godly and religious by fits and starts only, upon some special and
extraordinary occasions, but Qualitatis verae tenor permanet: falsa non durant.
Sen. ep. 120. Perpetua ac solida sunt, quae vera sunt: simulata non
perseverant. Ambr. offic. l. 2. c. 22.
in a constant and continued course, at all times, even when such occasions
cease. Psalm. 119. 112.
I have applied my self to keep thy Commandments continually, says David:
And, Psalm. 119. 117.
I will delight my self continually in thy Commandments, which I love. And,
Prove. 28. 14.
Blessed is the man, that fears continually; says Solomon. This constant
delight in the word of God, this constant applying of our selves to the doing
of the will of God, this continual standing in awe of God, is a sound note of
sincerity. But Magna rem puta unu^ homine agere. Preter sapiense nemo unum
agit: caeteri multiformes sunt, Modo frugi videntur and graves; modo prodigi
and vani. Mutamus subinde persona, and contrariam ei sumimus quam exumus. Sen.
epist. 120.
when men seem to be so affected only upon some extraordinary occasions, and
when those are once over, all is gone again, it is a shrewd sign that nothing
was ever sound or sincere with them. And this well weighed will easily discover
the unsoundness of many sorts that yet make a great show for a season. Some at
the first hearing of the Word seem to be wondrously affected and ravished with
it. The novelty and the strangeness of the Doctrine delivered, (as they say
at Athens, Act. 17. 18, 19, 32.
We will hear thee once again, because thou tellest us of new Doctrine, such
as we never heard of before;) or the eloquence and powerful delivery of the
Preacher, (some Act. 18. 24.
Apollos, it may be, or some Mark. 3. 17.
son of Thunder; Matthew. 7. 28; 29. John 7. 46.
one that speaks so as they never heard man speak before;) or the
consideration of such Hebr. 6. 5.
glorious matters as are in it propounded, of an heaven and an happiness, and
blessedness beyond conceit, and without end; may much affect even a natural
man, at the first hearing especially, and make him to be wondrously delighted
in it: and yet may the Word have no sound or saving work on him: all may prove
but a flash, and so be by and by gone again. Matthew. 13. 5, 20, 21. and 8. 6,
13. Quae simulata sunt diuturna esse non possunt, sed tanquam ad tempus
virentia, cito decidum. Quod fictum est, in principio vernat, in processu
tanquam flosculus dissipatur and solvitur: quod autem verum and sincerum alta
radice fundatur. Ambr. de offic. l. 2. c. 22.
Those that receive the seed on the stony ground, hear the Word at first with
some delight, but shortly after they dwindle and wither away, because they want
root. This their delight is not permanent, because the Word had no root in
them. Yea thus, as Greenha^ observe. title Sermons.
a reverend Divine well observes, and Quidam ad magnificas voces excitantur,
and transeunt in affectum dicentium, alacres vultu and animo: nec aliter
concitantur, quam solent Phrygij tibicinis sono Semiviri, and ex imperio
furentes. Rapit illos instigatque rerum pulchritudo, non verborum inanium
sonitus. Iuvat protinus, quae audiunt facere. Afficiuntur illi; and sint quales
jubentur, si illa animo forma permaneat, si non impetum insignem protinus

perferre potuerunt. Se^. epist. 108.
an Heathen man also in effect the same long before him, as some are said to be
Sea-sicke; so others may be said to be Sermon-sicke. Sea-passengers that do
not well brook the Seas, so long as they are upon the water, are faint and
sick, and out of frame, so as that they think they shall sure miscarie with
it, they make account to die no other death; but when they have gotten on land
and reposed them a while, they are as well again as ever they were. So is it
with some mere natural men sometime at a Sermon. Hearing some powerful
Divine, that strikes somewhat home with them, that thundreth and lightneth, as
he said that De quo Aristophanes Acharn. (...). Fulminabat, tonabat,
permiscebat Graecia^. Cic. Orat. Vnde and Olympius dictus est. Plut. Pericle.
Pericles did, their mind is troubled, and their conscience touched, and their
soul melts, and they grow heart-sicke, and have much inward remorse, and
begin to bethink themselves of taking a new course; but no sooner the Sermon
is done, and they are come out of the Church, and have taken a little the fresh
air of the world again, but all is over and gone, they are restored to their
wonted estate, and retired to their former courses again. It is with them, as
with those that have (...). Plut. sympos. problem. l. 3. c. 8.
taken a small quantity of some purging Physic beneath the due dosis, enough
to stir and trouble them, but not enough to purge or to work ought out of
them. You may see some such thing in Foelix, Act. 24. 25.
when he heard Paul discourse very powerfully (as right well he could) of
justice, righteousness, repentance, and the judgment to come, he was cast
into a trembling fit withal for the present: and not able well to brook
either the matter of his doctrine, or the manner of his delivery of it, he
caused him to break off; but that he was never the better for it afterward,
appears hereby, in that notwithstanding it Act. 24. 26.
he persisted in his accustomed bribery, and other the like corrupt courses.
Again thus some for a brunt at their first coming on to the profession of
religion, having some special motive to incite them thereunto, seem very
fervent and Zealous, even (...). Romans 12. 12. fervidi.

continued, which these do not. His foul fall was but for a fit, a fit of
infirmity it was only in him. Whereas on the other side, their fierce
forwardness is but for a fit, a sudden fit of heat it is only in them. Thus
many again, as an Nuper me amici cujusdam languor admonuit, optimos esse nos,
dum infirmi sumus. Quem enim infirmum aut avaritia, aut libido solicitat? Non
amoribus servit, non adpetit honores, opes negligit, and quantulumcunque, ut

Heathen man also has observed, when they lie deadly sick, oh then they seem
wondrously well affected, they are very sorry for their sins, seem even to
hate and abhor them, very devout and frequent in prayer to God, taxing and
censuring themselves for their former carelessness in that kind, and now if
God would vouchsafe to continue life, and restore health to them, they would be
new men, leave their sins, and their former lewd courses, and lead another
manner of life than ever they did. But it is with them, as it is with Seamen
sometime in a storm, that out of fear of danger and desire of safety Ion. 1.
5. Act. 27. 19, 38. - jactu decidere cepit Navita cum ventis, imitatus castora,
qui se Eunuchum ipse facit cupiens evadere damno. Iuvenal. sat. 12.
cast all that ever they have ouer-boord, which when the storm is over, they
strive and labor as fast^ if by any means they can, to get up again.
Plerique futuri supplicij metu peccatorum conscij poenitentiam petunt: qui

When they are once free from that fear, that before affected them, they
return to their former courses afresh, as if it repented them now that ever it
had repented them of them. Psalm. 78. 34-37.
When God slew them, says the Psalmist, then they sought him, and returned,
and enquired after God early. But they flattered him only with their mouth, and
lied unto him with their tongues. For their heart was never upright with him,
neither were they steadfast in his Covenant. And therefore well did Apud
Spinaeum alicubi ni male memini.
the Emperor Sigismunds Confessor answer him, when being in a sore fit of
sickness, and having made many goodly fair promises and protestations of
future reformation upon recovery, and amendment of life, he desired of him to
be informed, whereby he might discern whether such his repentance were
sincere; If, quoth he, you be as careful to make good in your health, what you
now promise, as you are forward now in your extremity to promise. And in like
manner is it with many others in some outward danger and distress. Ionaes
seamen distressed by that sudden and strange storm, Iona 1. 5.
Call every one on his God, then every man to prayer, a man would think no
deuouter men again in the world; but when the danger is once over, nothing but
swearing and swaggering, blaspheming and tearing of that Name, that before so
reverently they inuocated, none prophaner than some of those that a little
before seemed so devout. It is that which God complains of in Judah and
Ephraim: Hosh. 6. 4.
O Ephraim what shall I do with thee? or how should I deal with thee, O
Judah? for your goodness is as a morning cloud; and at the early dew it goes
away. No longer than Gods hand was heavy upon them, and the night of his wrath
did in fearful manner ouer-spread them, was there any show at all of
goodness or godliness to be seen in them. A particular and pregnant example
of such carriage we may see in the Inhabitants of Jerusalem: Their City was
Ierem. 34. 1.
besieged and begirt by the Chaldeans, and in great danger to be surprised.
Hereupon Ier. 34. 7, 9, 10.

an Image that goes with a device, that stirs no longer than the force
lasts of the screw or the spring that sets it a stirring. And that is the
difference between Natural and Artificial motions: the motion of the pulse,
and the breath in man's body, and the motion of an Image, or a Mill, and the
like: a free motion and a forced one. The ground of the motion in the one is
from within, of the other from without: there is some stresse and straining
required to the staying of the one; and there is some like stresse and strain
required for the stirring of the other: and the one therefore stirs
constantly till it be staid; the other stays and stands still till it be
stirred: and when that force and stresse is gone, the one again stirs, when
that force and stresse is gone, the other again stays. The motion of the
godly, in the good ways of God, is like the pacing of a beast broken and
brought to a true pace, or naturally ambling of it self, he keeps to his
pace constantly, and though he may be forced out of it, yet he does nothing so
well with it, Quomodo Sense. ep. 121. Animalia quaedam tergi durioris inversa

nor is it for his ease, but he is ever and anon making offer to come into it
again, and so does so soon as he finds himself free from such enforcement.
Whereas the motion of Hypocrites in Gods ways, is as the pacing of a beast not
truly paced, that being forced to pace, shuffleth but, and though he may be
kept a while to it, yet cannot long hold out with it, is ready, if he be not
held hard to it, at every step to go out of it, and is never well till he be
in his trot again. Exodus 9. 27, 28. and 10. 16, 17.
Pharaoh himself would relent somewhat while Gods hand was upon him, but Exodus

Iron it was before, and iron it is still. It is true indeed that a man,

even on the Sabbath they would needs go to seek it; with Number. 11. 5.
a preferring even of Egyptian Leeks before it, and a longing after them
again: where an utter casting off of all fear of God and care of good
courses, when such occasions, as put them into it, are once blown over; it
gives just ground of suspicion, that the former forwardness in Gods cause was
no sincere love of God, but a sudden fit of passion only in the one; the
fearfulness of Gods wrath no sanctified fear, but a servile and slavish
disposition only in the other.

Yea but will some say peradventure, Objections 2.
(for my desire is herein to help weak souls and tender consciences all that
I can: Objection 1.
) This is that that so much troubles me, that I cannot find and feel in my
self such inward remorse and hearty sorrow for my sins, or such alacrity
and viuacitie of spirit, as sometime I have done, or as at my first supposed,
but now suspected, conversion I did.

I answer: Answer.
Nor is it to be suspected that always one so should: or is the soundness of
the parties conversion to be either questioned or suspected in that regard if
he do not. For it stands with reason, that a strange Change, especially
where it is suddenly effected, from one contrary to another should more affect,
and be more sensible, than the after-continuance of that estate which by such a
change is introduced. The heat of an hot bath or an hot-house, is more sensible
at our first entrance, especially if on a sudden we chop into it, than it is
when we have been some space of time in it. And (...). Synes. epist. 139.
the more familiar every thing grows to be with us, the less sensible is the
power and the work of it upon us. In this kind therefore also is there great
difference between those that are at an instant converted, as Act. 9. 4, 6.
and 16. 30-34.
Paul was, and those that with 1 Timothy 4. 6. 2 Timothy 3. 15.
Timothy, have the grace of God wrought into them by degrees. The league that
was naturally between the soul and Satan, is violently rent asunder in the
one, it is gently Sicut Cic. de Amic. Magis decere censent sapientes amicitias
sensim dissuere, quam repent disscindere.
vnript and unsown in the other. The one are suddenly Jude 23.

Sampsons were, in the one; they are easily fretted. by little and little, as
Psalm. 73. 4.
the bands of life that hold body and soul together in persons weak and far
spent, in the other: the one have their spiritual fetters at once knocked off
by force, the other filed off (...). Greg. Naz. in Mat. 19.
by degrees. And hence it is that the one are oft-times more sensible of what
is wrought upon them, and done in them at their first conversion, than
afterward; the other find and feel their own growth and progress better
than they. Nor are any to be dismayed or to misdoubt themselves therefore, those
especially of the former sort, so long as they can find in themselves a
continued love of Gods word, a constant use of good means, and care of good
courses, albeit good things seem not so sensible with them, as they did at the
first.

Again, Objection 2.
will some say, that troubles me, that I find the fear of God indeed so
fresh in me, when Gods hand is present upon me, or upon some others in my
sight; and so little of it again, when that is gone. Yea, that I seem in such
cases to be more affected with the outward evil it self, than with my sins
that have procured it: which makes me to fear, that this my fear is at the
most but a servile fear, and such as Hypocrites are wont in the like cases to
have.

I answer: Answer 1.
1. It is agreeable both to reason and to religion, that the Fear of God
should be more fresh with us, and more than ordinary at other times, when
special occasions thereof occur. 1 Chronicles. 13. 12.
David feared God that day, says the Story; what time Vzza was so suddenly
smitten and slain. He feared him before, but his fear was then much more than
ordinary, by occasion of that extraordinary judgment. Yea, for a man not to
have his fear of God in some sort proportioned to the various and diverse
occasions of expressing and exercising it; as for a man to fear no more, or no
otherwise, when some eminent judgments of God discover themselves either
incumbent or imminent, on himself or on others, than he does ordinarily at
other times; were a strange kind of stupiditie, and a shrewd argument of
unsoundness. It is one thing to cast off all fear and regard of God at other
times; and another thing not to have his fear so fresh in us at other times,
as on such occasions we find and feel it to be.

2. Answer 2.
It is to be considered, that the fear even of Gods wrath, or the servile
fear, as it is usually termed, is Timor servili^ materialiter no^ est malum.
Riber. in Malach. 1. 6. Timor servilis secundum substantiam suam bonus est.
Aquin. sum. p. 22. 2^. q. 19. a. 4.
not simply evil of it self. Though where it is unsanctified, by occasion of
man's corruption, as being joined with Quem enim metuunt odere; quem quisque
obit perisse expetit. Cic. offic. l. 2.
an hatred of him whom it fears, it is evil, and produces many evil and
sinful effects. For it is a thing in nature, (and I speak now not of nature
corrupted, but of nature created) for Ab interitu natura abhorret: hinc
ingenita cuique curae sui, metus mortis, fuga mali, etc. Cic. de fin. l. 5.
Nullum animal ad vita^ prodit sine metu mortis. Omne animal constitutioni suae
co^ciliatur. Simul autem conciliatur saluti suae quidque, and quae juvant, illa
petit, laesura formidat. Sen. epist. 121.
each thing to fear that that tends to it own evil. Yea it were an evil
and an ungracious thing in a child, even in Gods child, (...). Greg. Naz. in
Nyssen.
not to stand in much awe of his fathers wrath, or not to fear his fathers rod.

3. Answer 3.
It is not to be wondered, considering that there is ordinarily a far less
measure of grace than of corruption in the most, and that grace also strippeth
us not wholly of this fear, but does only qualify and correct it, if even in
Gods children Psalm. 32. 3, 4.
the apprehension of Gods heavy indignation do so drown the consideration of
their own transgressions, that they can hardly amids those terrors and Psalm.
55. 4, 5.
horrors that their hearts and minds are possessed with, descry and discern
their grief and sorrow for their sins. Psalm. 119. 119, 120.
When thou take away the wicked of the world like dross; My flesh, says
David, trembles again for fear of thee, and I am horribly afraid of thy
judgments. And, Habb. 3. 16.
When I heard of it, says Habbakuk, my belly quaked, and my lips quiuered, and
I trembled and shook, so that my bones seemed to be not out of joint, but even
rotten again. And (...); Greg. Naz. ad cives periclitant.
if it were so with such Worthies, no marvel if the like sometime befall weak
ones.

4. Answer 4.
Let it be remembered, that as Grace does not wholly strip us of this Fear, so
it does not cross us, but concur rather with us in the use and exercise of
it. And it follows not therefore that a man's sorrow for his sin is not
sincere, because his fear of Gods wrath is greater or rifer in him than it. It
is a Question propounded by Perkins Cases of Conscience, lib. 1. cap. 5.
quaest. 1. sect. 2. case 3.
a worthy Divine, whether a man's grief for his sin may be deemed sincere or
no, when he can weep more for the loss of some dear friend than for it. And
his Answer is, which may well also serve, because the reason will hold, here;
that it may, because nature and grace concur in the one, whereas nature and
grace cross in the other. Since that Grace therefore does not wholly either
inhibite or restrain a man either from fearing of outward judgments, or being
sensible of outward evils, so that Grace and Nature cross not but concur
rather therein; whereas in godly sorrow for sin, corrupt Nature concurreth not
with Grace, but is cross rather and auerse thereunto: it is not to be
marvelled, (especially where Grace yet is but weak) if that fear and grief
be greater, or more sensible at least, (for Casus leves loquuntur, ingentes
stupent. Sen. tragoed.
the greatest grief is not always the most sensible, nor makes always the
most show; Plu^ sensum afficit dolens digitus ab aciculae punctiuncula, quam
integra corporis totius incolumitas. Spin. de justit. Christian. Hinc apud
Plut. de audien. ille (...).
a man may fear more, and be more heartily sorry for a consumption that he
misdoubteth himself to be far gone in, than for a felon on his fingers end,
that puts him to more pain, and goes, as we say, to the very heart with
him, for the present,) wherein two agents concur, then wherein the one is
alone, and the other hinders more than helps.

A fifth Note Note 5.
of Sincerity, may be a Jealousy of ones own Hypocrisy: Jealousy of
Hypocrisy.
when a man is suspicious of himself, and timorous lest he should be
insincere. As the Disciples of our Savior, when he told them, Matthew. 26. 21.
One of you will betray me* though they knew themselves far from any such
thought or purpose at the present, yet every one of them began to suspect
himself, that he might be the man that our Savior Christ meant, and Matthew. 26.
22.
to ask thereupon, Is it I, Lord? or Is it I? Judas that was the man indeed,
was most silent of any; though at length Matthew. 26. 25.
he ask also for company, lest by not asking when each other did, he might
move suspicion, and so bewray himself by his silence. And in like manner is it
here. Hypocrites do least question their own sincerity of all others. They
most misdoubt it usually that are furthest of all from it. Psalm. 119. 60.
Oh, let mine heart be upright in thy Statutes, says sincere David; (as
suspecting or misdoubting himself, lest it might prove otherwise;) that I may
not be shamed. Madmen are not wont to question whether they be in their right
wits or no. Yea Non est insanus, insanum qui se dicit. Apu^. in apolog. aut
etiam putat. Quid? caput abscissum demens quu^ portat Agaue Gnati insoelicis,
sibi tu^ furiosavidetur? Horat. sermon. l. 2. sat. 3.
they are not mad, says one, that think or suspect that they are. And
certainly this godly jealousy, this shienesse of unsoundness is so good and
so sure an argument of sincerity, that I know none better, none surer than it.
For such careful and anxious inquiry, such fearfulness of hypocrisy, argues
a strong desire of sincerity: and the desire of Grace, as we shall see
afterward, is generally agreed on to be Grace. Yea even overmuch timorousness
and superfluous curiosity in this kind, when men cannot satisfy themselves
with anything, no not with the pregnantest proofs of it, and are therefore
thereby much disturbed, perplexed, and distracted, though it be an infirmity,
and ought therefore with all good endeavor to be remedied, because it
dismayeth, disheartneth, disturbeth the peace of the mind, depriueth the soul
of alacrity, dulleth and dampeth the spirits, and hinders much in the
performance of many necessary good duties; yet as they use to say of
shamefastness, Malae causae bonu^ signum.
It is a good sign of an evil cause, though it proceed froman (...). Aristot.
ethic. l. 4. c. 9. (...). Idem rhet. l. 2. c. 6.
evil cause, a consciousnesse commonly of some defect; yet it is Hinc

ep. 84.
a sign of some grace; so is this, though of it self a weakness, yet a sign
of much grace and goodness: it is like some weeds, that though they be weeds,
of no good use, but unprofitable, and such as hinder the growth of better
things, that might succeed in their room, if they were once removed, yet are

signs of a rich and a fat soil, and howsoever therefore they may discourage
an unskillful person from dealing with it, yet will give a wise and an
experienced man encouragement thereunto.

A sixth Note of Sincerity may be a sight and sense of ones own Incredulity
and Impenitency with a serious grief for it. Note 6.
It was the poor man's speech to our Savior in the Gospel; Mark. 9. 24.
I believe, Sight and sense of Incredulity, and Impenitencie; with Grief.
Lord; help my unbelief. His Faith he found and felt mixed with much
infidelity and incredulity; and the sense of his infidelity, with the grief
for it, argued his Faith. And Vide Antoninum sum. histor. part. 3. tit. 18. c.
6. Hartma^. Schedel. atate 6. and Petr. Mart. in 2. Sam. 24.
it is reported of the Mother of three men of great note, that when she told
her Confessor, that considering what rare Scholars and Men of note her three
sons, whom she had by unlawful means begotten on her, had proved; the one
Petrus Comestor Magister Historiarum.
the Master of the Stories, another Petr. Lombardus Mag. Sententiaru^.
the Master of the Sentences, and the third Gratianus Decreti Compilator.
the Collector and Compiler of the Decrees, she could not be so sorry for her
sin as she should; he made her answer again, and it was no evil answer;
Dole, quod non doles; quod dolere non possis.
Be sorry for this then, that thou art or can be no more sorry. And
undoubtedly as when we have best believed, yet we shall have cause still to
repent us of our unbelief: so when we have repented the best we can of our
sins, we shall have cause to repent us even then of our impenitencie, of a
want of repentance in us. But this ignorant, unfaithful, impenitent persons
are not usually apprehensiue and sensible of. They believe and repent, they say
(and (...). Greg. Naz. de sede Constant.
it may well be they think and believe as they say,) as well as the best. And
shall I tell you what is the cause of it? Peccatores dormientibus, somnianbus
fimiles. Joan. Herolt. de temp. 2. Jude 8.
Sinners, says one, are sleepers. They are as men in a dream: and there is
Somnianti nihil difficile. Magna etenim saepe in somnis faciuntque geruntque,
Reges expugnant, acresque and praelia miscent. Et in noctis caligine Cernere
censemus solemn lumenque diurnu^; Conclusique loco coelum, mare, flumma, montes
Mutare, and campos pedibus transire videmur. Lucret. l. 4.
nothing difficult with dreamers. Men may dream, and many do often, that they
fly in the air, and swim over the sea: but are far enough for all that from
doing or being able to do either, as they will soon find, when they are once
awaked out of their dream. In like manner is it with these silly deluded
souls. They lie fast Ephesians. 5. 14.
asleep in sin, and so doing Quomodo de Platone Lactant. institut. l. 5. c.
14. Somniaverat Deum, non cogn^verat. Et de quibusdam Bern. Cant. 18. Dormiens
in contemplatione Deum sommat.
they dream yet of faith and the fear of God and repentance, and other graces
of Gods Spirit; they dream, I say, that they have these things as well and as
much as any, yea so well as better needs not to be had. Whereas others that be
awaked out of this imaginous sleep, and do now indeed truly repent and
believe, find many wants, much defectiuenesse, in their Repentance, their
Faith, their Hope, their fear of God, their dependence upon God, and the other
graces of his Spirit, truly indeed, but imperfectly as yet begun and wrought in
them. Yea, as Hinc Socrates ille de quo Ora^ulum (...), de se, (...). Laert.
the more knowledge a man has, the more he comes to know his ignorance; the
more skill he has, the more he comes to discover his own unskillfulness:
Hinc illud Menedemi, (...). Plut. de profect.
A young Scholar when he has gotten his Seton or his Ramus once by heart,
thinks he has as much Logic as his Tutor can teach him; but when he
comes indeed to understand things, he sees his own error: So (...)
Chrysostom. in Matthew. hom. 25.
the more men believe, the more they come to see and feel their own
unbelief; the further they wade on in the study and practice of repentance,
the more they find out and discover their own impenitence, and complain of
the hardness and unto wardnesse of their hearts: the more they labor and make
progress in sound sanctification, the more come they to apprehend and to see
into the depth of their corruption. And this very sense of the want of grace,
is a good argument of grace. It is a sure sign of Grace, to see no Grace, and
to see it with grief. For, Matthew. 5. 3.
Blessed, says our Savior, are those that are poor in spirit; even as well
as those Matthew. 5. 8.
that are pure in Spirit. The one, he says, Matthew. 5. 8.
shall see God, and the other has a present right to the Kingdom of God,
which is the same in effect: Matthew. 5. 3.
For the Kingdom of God is theirs. He says not, Blessed are the rich in
Grace; though that also be most true: but, Blessed are the poor in spirit:
that is, such as are spiritually poor, humbled, dejected, cast down in the
sight and sense of their own wants, apprehending nothing so much as the want
of grace in themselves. Such are blessed, because such are Vt verum sit hic
quod Prove. 13. 7.
rich, though they cannot yet come to see and apprehend their own wealth. And
this he says no doubt, that if any weak one be not able yet to discern the
purity of his own heart, he may yet be comforted in the very poverty of his
Spirit: the serious sense whereof may assure him that he is in part come out of
his sin, and is entered into the state of grace. For Qu^re vitia sua nemo
confitetur? (nemo pervidet) quia adhuc in illis est. Somnium narrare vigilantis
est: and vitia sua confiteri sanitatis indicium est. Expergiscamur necesse est,
ut errores nostros coarguere possimus. Sen. ep. 54.
it is a sure sign that a man is awaked out of his sleep, when he discovers
and sees the errors of his Dream. And it is in these cases with men
commonly, as it is in drawing up of water; as long as the bucket is under water
we feel not the weight of it, but so soon as it comes above water, it
begins to hang heavy on the hand: when a man diueth under water he feels
no weight of the water, though there be many tun of it over his head; Elementa
in loco suo gravia no^ sunt. Vide Syrianum and Ptolomaeum apud Simplic. ad
Aristot. de Coelo l. 4. c. 16. and Scortiam. de Nilo l. 2. c. 11.
The element, they say, weighs not in his own proper place; whereas half a
tub full of the same water taken out of the river and set upon the same man's
head, would be very burdensome unto him, and make him soon grow weary of it.
In like manner, so long as a man is over head and ears Act. 8. 23.
in sin, he is not sensible of the weight of sin, it is not troublesome at
all to him; but when he begins once to come out of that state of sin,
wherein he lay and lived before, then begins sin to hang heavy on him,
and he to feel the heavy weight of it. So long as sin is in Peccatum

sin lives in the soul, vnkilled wholly and unmortified as yet, so long our
corruption is nothing at all cumbersome to us; but when it is once mortified in
a man, it begins to grow burdensome unto him, and to hang like a lump of
dead flesh upon his soul; and then begins he poor soul pestred and
oppressed with the weight of it, to cry out with the Apostle, Romans 7. 24.
O wretched man that I am; when shall I be once freed from this (...), Corpus
mortis, pro mortuo, sive cadavere.
carcass of sin, that hangs so heavy upon my soul? It is with him as with
one that has had a fit of the falling sickness, or that begins to recover
again after a dead palsy. So long as a man is in a fit of the falling
sickness, though he be for the time in such lamentable plight, that he lies
along like a beast, unable to stand on his legs, or to lift up himself, or do
ought to help himself, foaming and sprawling, and beating his own body, a
ruefull sight to all that see him; yet is he all the while himself insensible
of ought: but when the fit is once over, and the man is come to himself
again, then he begins to find and feel himself all out of frame, his
head heavy and giddie, his eyes staring and distorted, his brain and whole
body disturbed and strangely disposed, all which before he was not sensible of:
As also while a man lies, rather than lives, held with a dead palsy, though
he be not able to stir hand or foot, yet (...). Plut. de profect.
has he himself no sense of it; but when those dead parts of him are in some
measure revived again, the passages being opened for the vital Spirits to
repair to them, and so sense and motion restored to them in part, then making
offer to go or to stir, he begins to feel and complain of the
stiffenesse and starknesse of his limbs and joints, and a general
vnwealdinesse throughout his whole body. And in like manner is it here. So
long as a man is wholly Ephesians. 2. 1. Coloss. 2. 13.
dead in sin, albeit he be as much disabled unto the doing of any holy duty,
as a dead man is unto the actions of this life, yet he finds it not, Mortuu^
est membrum, quod dolorem non sentit. Bern. medit. c. 12.
he feels it not, he apprehends no such either disabilitie in himself, or
difficulty in the duties that he should do; but when any measure of
spiritual life is once infused into the soul, whereby Romans 6. 11.
he lives now to God, that lay before spiritually dead, now striving to apply
himself unto Gods work, and to walk in the good ways of God, he begins
to find and feel, with much pain and grief of mind, his own infirmity
and weakness, the strange blindness of his mind, the dulnes and drowsines of
his spirits, the untowardness of his heart, the rebelliousnesse of his will;
the sense whereof is a sure argument of spiritual life begun in him. For as
Augustine says well, though in another case and upon another occasion; Potest
esse vita sine dolor; dolor sine vita esse non potest. Aug. de Civit. l. 19.
c. 13.
There may be some life without grief; but there can be nogriefe without life.
So there may be some spiritual life without any sense of pain or grief at
all, as with the glorified ones in heaven it is: but there can be no 2 Cor. 7.
10. Argumentu^ salutis est via doloris. Greg. mor. l. 6. c. 17.
godly sorrow or sense of spiritual pain and grief, where no beginning at
all of spiritual life is. And therefore it is that our Savior also
pronounces them Matthew. 5. 4.
Blessed, that thus mourn: nor does he say that they shall be, but that they
are already in a blessed estate, and that in due time Ibid.
they shall have comfort. Yea, undoubtedly these very heavy and uncomfortable
signs are of all other the surest signs of true grace and sincerity, because
least subject to deceit and delusion of any.

A seventh Note of sincerity, Note 7. Desire of Grace.
is an earnest Desire of Grace. Though a man cannot discern yet any Grace in
himself, yet if he do seriously and earnestly desire grace, it is a good
sign of some beginning of Grace. For it is Grace, even to desire Grace. It is
the first step unto Grace, for a man to see no Grace; and it is the first
degree of Grace, for a man to desire Grace: when a man's heart does with an holy
Echo answer Gods voice as David's did: Psalm. 27. 8.
Seek my face; say Thou. O Lord, thy face will I seek. And, Psalm. 119. 4, 5.
Thou have commanded us diligently to keep thy Law. Oh that my ways were so
directed, that I might keep thy Statutes. When it can say seriously with
Augustine; Lord, enable Da, Domine, quod jubes, and jube quod vis. Aug.

It is a principal part of goodness, says the Heathen man, for a man to be

habe^e voluntatem. Aug. epist. 45.
it is the very essence of Righteousness, says Augustine, for a man to be
willing to be righteous. It is not an help only unto health, but even a
degree of health, though (...). Arist ethic. Eudem. l 7. c. 2.

it is a principal part of our sickness to be unwilling to be cured: so is it
a principal part of health with us here to be willing to be healed: When we
can in sincerity of heart answer that question of our Savior to the sick
man, John 5. 7.
Will thou be healed? with a Sana me, Domine, Ier. 17. 14.

servants that desire to fear thy Name. And, 2 Chronicles. 30. 18, 19.
The good God, says Hezekias, be merciful to that man that sets his heart
to seek the Lord. And surely, as Bernard says well, discoursing on those
words of the Prophet; Lam. 3. 25.
The Lord is good to those that wait on him, and to the Soul that seeks him:
For as it is elsewhere, Prove. 8. 17. 1 Chronicles. 28. 9.
those that so seek him, shall find him Si tam bonus quaerenti, quid

If God, says he, be so good to those that seek him; What will he be to them,
when they find him? But this is a strange thing, that no man can so seek him
before he has found him. And surely, as no man can sincerely seek God in
vain; so no man can sincerely desire grace in vain. Quid tibi jubet Deus?

A man may love Gold, and yet not have it: but no man loves God, but he is
sure to have God, says Augustine. Prove. 13. 4.
Wealth a man may desire, and yet be never the nearer it: but Grace no man ever
sincerely desired and missed of it. It is true here that the Psalmist in
another case says; Psalm. 10. 17.
Lord, thou hear the desire of the poor; thou have prepared their heart,
and thine ear hearkeneth to their prayers. It is God that has prepared the
heart, and wrought this desire in it; (for Philip. 2. 13.
it is God that works such willingness in us:) and he will never frustrate
the desire that himself has there wrought. Yea, as no man, says he, can
seek God but he that has found him; and it is a sign therefore that a man
has already found God in part, when seriously and sincerely he seeks him:
So Huc usque te faciente profeci, ut desidere^ desiderare te. Quid est autem
desiderare desiderium? Si enim desidero esse desiderans, jam invenio me
desiderante^. Sed nunquid desiderium tui desiderantem, quasi non habeam, aut
desiderium majus quam habeam? Gulielm. de S. Theodor. de amor. Dei c. 2.
no man can desire grace, but he that already has grace: (for he that
desires grace, has grace to desire it:) and it is an infallible sign
therefore, that a man has already some measure of grace, that does seriously
desire to have it. He would never desire to fear God, that stood not in some
awe of him already: nor desire to feel in himself a love of God, that did
not in some measure already love God: Nor could a man ever truly desire
sanctifying grace, were not his heart already sanctified by the Spirit of
Grace, which has wrought also in him that desire of it. Not to add that the

Paul's own ingenuous confession of himself: and who went ever beyond him? How
far at least come the most short of him?) consists rather in will, then in
work, and in desire and endeavor, more then in deed.

True it is indeed, that any natural man may desire happiness, glory,
salvation, and eternal well-being. Number. 23. 10.
Oh, says Balaam, that I might die the death of the righteous, and that my
latter end might be like his: ( Optabat sibi extrema justorum, sed non ita and
principia. Mortem spiritualium optant sibi carnales, quorum vitam tamen
abhorrent. Bern. in Cant. 2. Non curant qu^rere, quae tamen desiderant
invenire: cupiunt consequi, non and sequi. Ibid.
he desired indeed to die their death, but to live their life he could not
endure:) (...). Aristot. ethic. l. 1. c. 1. and polit. l. 1. c. 1.
it is natural for every one to desire his own natural good. But to desire
spiritual grace, holiness, sound sanctification, faith unfeigned, the true
fear of God, serious repentance, is more than any natural man ever did or can
do. And therefore Blessed are they, says our Savior, as, Matthew. 5. 3.
that are poor in spirit, and Matthew. 5. 4.
that mourn for their spiritual defects; so Matthew. 5. 6.
that hunger and thirst after righteousness, after spiritual grace, after a
supply of them. Now what is (...). Aristot. de anima. lib. 2. cap. 3.
hunger but a want of food with a sense thereof, and an earnest desire of it?
or what is thirst but a drought, a want of drink, and a vehement desire of it?
For in hunger and thirst there are these three things: first, an emptiness in
the one, and a want of moisture in the other: for Hinc (...). Plut. sympos.
probl. l. 5. c. 3. Et inde Sitiendi verbum deduci, (...), quia cibum sequitur
sitis. Iul. Scalig. de cause. ling. Lat. c. 126.
it is not want of food simply, but want of wetting that causes this:
secondly, a sense of this emptiness and want of moisture, with a special
kind of pain and grief in the body proceeding from it: For a man may be
empty bodied, and yet not affected thus with it, as (...). Plut. ibid. c. 2.
in some diseases, and where natural heat is much wasted: and thirdly, a
vehement desire of such either nouriture or mo^sture, whereby this emptiness
may be filled, or this drought slaked: For a man may be empty, and sick
again in some sort with it, yea ready to die of it, and yet have no appetite
to his meat neither, but Quanto inanior, tanto fas^idiosior. Aug. confess. l.
3. c. 1.
a loathing of that rather, whereby he might be refreshed and relieved: he may
be empty of food, and yet feel it not; he may feel it in some sort, and yet
not desire food. But in hunger and thirst ordinarily do these all three
concur. Yea, so vehement and violent is this desire of such supply often in
hunger and thirst, that 2 King. 6. 25, 28, 29. Lament. 1. 11. Hinc Lysimachus
siti laborans cum post se suosque hosti deditos bibisset, (...) Plut. in
apophth.
for a bit of bread, or a cup of drink, men have many times been content to
part with the dearest and pretiousest things that they have been possessed of.
In like manner is it in this spiritual hunger and thirst. There is first
spiritual poverty, a vacuitte, an emptiness of grace, to sight and sense it
may be, utterly of all, in deed and truth of some degree of it: there is
secondly a Fames and sitis dolores sunt. Aug. confess. l. 10. c. 31. Vide and
eundem de Music. l. 6. c. 5.
grief and painfulnesse in the heart and soul arising from the apprehension
of it, a mourning and bemoaning of ones self for the want of it: and thirdly,
Est sitis interior, uti and venture interior; quia est homo interior. Aug. in
Joan. 32. Ipsum desiderium sitis est animae. Idem in Psalm. 62.
an earnest desire of it above all things in the world, so that as a man
thoroughly an hungered counts all nothing in regard of meat, a man heartily
a-thirst all nothing in comparison of drink, he would give any thing for it:
so the soul thus affected, with the blessed Apostle counts Philip. 3. 8, 9,
10.
all nothing but dross and dung, in comparison of Christ, the knowledge of
him, faith in him, and conformity unto him. It is with it, as with (...).
Macar. homil. 45.
a Kings child, that though it be never so richly arrayed, and have never so
many costly jewels hanging about it, yet all is as nothing to it, nothing but
the nurses breast can still it, when for want of food it is out of quiet. So
nothing but spiritual grace can here satisfy the soul, and all other things
are esteemed as nothing to it. Or as with some women that go with child, and
are subject to longing; they will part with any thing for that that they long
for, and are ready even to sink down, to faint, to go away, yea Quomodo
Rachel de prole. Genesis 30. 1.
to die, if they have it not: So here spiritual grace and the sense and
assurance of it, is the thing longed for, and that they would give a whole
world for to obtain, if they had it, and they are ready even to faint and
sink under that heavy weight of grief that surchargeth their distressed
souls, because they cannot yet find and feel that in themselves, which yet
undoubtedly they have. For certainly whosoever they be that can find
themselves in this sort affected, Verba Domini sunt; non est fas fide^
suspendere. Credant, quod non experi^^tur, ut fructu^ quandoque experientiae
fidei merito consequantur. Bern. in Cant. 84.
either they must confess themselves to be in a blessed estate, and
consequently in the state of grace, (for what true happiness out of it?) or
else they must contradict our Savior, and charge John 14. 6.
Truth it self with untruth, who has pronounced them blessed that are so
affected. And this I desire to have well weighed and seriously considered for
the staying of many troubled souls. What is it that does so much trouble thee,
and in this lamentable wise distress and distract thee? Oh, says he
presently, I have no faith, no repentance, no love, no fear of God, no
sanctifying, no saving grace in me. Why? do thou see a want of these things
in thy self? Yes, that is it that so grieueth me: that I cannot love God,
stand in awe of him, trust in his mercy, repent of my sins as I should. Yea
but, do thou not seriously and unfeignedly desire to do thus? Oh yes, I
desire it above all things in the world, and I would be willing to buy, and it
were with a whole world, the least measure, a dram or a drop only, of such
grace. And Quaerit anima verbum, sed quae a verbo prius quaesita sit. Audi
profugam and deviam, quid doleat, and quid petat. Psalm. 119. 176. Nec expositam
omnino nec relictam dixerim qu^reverti cupit, and requiri petit. Vnde enim haec
voluntas illi? nisi quod a verbo visitata sit and quaesita. Nec otiosa

quod and qu^rit and diligit. Cant. 3. 1. Bern. in Cant. 84. Nec repellet
requirentem, qui contemnentem requisivit. Ibid.
who is it, I pray thee, that has wrought this desire in thee? Not the Devil:
he would rather quench it all he could in thee: Not thine own corrupt heart:
that is naturally most auerse thereunto: It must needs then be the work of the
Spirit of God, and of him who affirms them to be all in a blessed plight that
thus hunger and thirst after grace, and assures them withal, that they shall
one day be satisfied. Luke 8. 55.
Give her meat, said our Savior, when he had raised I^irus his Daughter, In
signum verae and perfectae sa^itatis. Iansen. (...). c. 34.
to show that she was not revived only, but recovered. A good stomach, we say,
is a sign of good health. And as hunger is a sign of health in the body: so
is this spiritual hunger of health in the Soul.

An eighth Note of Sincerity may be a desire and endeavor of growth in grace:
Note 8. Desire and Endeavor of Growth in Grace.
Desire, I say, and endeavor; for where desire indeed is, there endeavor also
will be: there cannot but be a serious endeavor, where the desire of the heart
is sincere. But 2 Pet. 3. 18.
grow in grace, says Saint Peter, inciting hereunto, and in the knowledge of
our Lord Jesus Christ. And, 1 Pet. 2. 2.
Desire the sincere milk of the Word, that ye may thereby grow. And it is the
joint prayer of the Apostles to their Savior and ours; Luke 17. 5.
Lord, increase our Faith, therein craving a further improuement of that grace
that already they had received. And the Heathen man himself makes it a note
of a good man, that (...). Euripid. apud Aristot. Rhet. l. 1. c. 11.
he studieth daily how he may grow better than he is, not contenting himself
with any degree or measure of goodness. Yea the Apostle Paul tells us, that
Eph^s. 4. 16.
the whole body of Christ (whereof Romans 12. 5. 1 Cor. 12. 27.
every true Christian is a limb) is so (...).
compact together in it self, and so firmly fastened with certain spiritual
nerves and ligaments to the head, that from it there is by them conueighed to
each part a continual supply of spiritual grace, both sufficient to furnish
it, and to further the growth of it.

Yea but, Objection 1.
peradventure will some say, that is it that makes me misdoubt my self, that
to mine own seeming I stand at a stay; and, me thinks, I have so done for a
long time together.

We can easily see the face and the countenance of another, we cannot behold
our own, but by reflection only. Christians many times better discern how
others grow in grace and come forward, than how themselves do, though it may
be growing as fast or faster than they. Qua vehimur navi fertur, cum stare

befall us, because this spiritual growth in the most is ordinarily but (...).

by insensible degrees. A man may stand gasing a long time upon the Dial, and
yet not perceive how the hand there stirs, though it be stirring all that
while: he may in warm springing weather sit night and day beside the young
green grass, and yet not discern the shooting up of it, though by the warmth
of the weather it be continually sprouting.

Thou may well therefore be growing, though thou do not discern it. As a
man may have grace, and yet not know it: so he may be growing in grace, and yet
not be aware of it. But do thou not desire and endeavor to grow in it? Magna
pars est profectus velle proficere. Sen. ep. 72. Ambulare proficere est. Sedet

Gersons similitude, or one somewhat like it at least: A man is bound for the
East Indies, and shapeth his course thitherward; but by the way is put off often
by cross winds to the westward, he is compelled to put into diverse harbors,
and to make some stay by the way there, either to shift off stormy weather, or
to take in fresh water. And yet all this while we say, he is going onward on
his way, because his purpose and resolution still continues the same. It is
much more so in spiritual things, because our very growth it self in them
consists much even in resolution and desire. The strength of desire never a
whit furthereth the seaman so long as he lies wind-bound to the making of
his port; but Omnis amor aut ascendit, aut descendit. Desiderio enim bon^
levamur ad Deum, and desiderio malo ad ima praecipitamur. Aug. in Psalm. 122.
Non enim ambulando sed amando ad Deum itur. Idem epist. 52. Non pedibus, s^d

nihil (...) liud quam ve^^^e. I Would confess. l. 8. c. 8.
the very strength of our desire may conueigh us nearer to God, may carry us
higher, as with Eagles wings, up toward heaven.

Yea this thy greedy desire of grace may make thee less sensible of thine
own growth: As the Heathen man observes, that Quaeris quid sit quod oblivione
acceplorum nobis faciat? cupiditas accipiendorum. Cogitamus non quid
impetratum, sed quid impetrandum sit. Sen. epist. 81. Solebat Attalus hac

Ibid. 72. Vltra se cupidit^ porrigit, and foelicitate^ suam no^ intelligit:
quia no^ unde venerit respicit, sed quo tendat. Ide^ de be^. l. 2. c. 27.
the earnest desire of what men would have, makes them forgetful of what they
have. Philip. 3 13.
I forget what is past, Answer 3.
says the Apostle, and press on to what is before. Their eye is more upon
what they want, than upon what they have. It is with good Christians in this
case, as with rich worldlings, that Instat equis o^^riga suos vincentibus,
illam Praeteritum te^^^^t extren^s inter euntem Horaet. sermon. l. 1. sat. 1.
like men in a race have their eye on those that be before them, not on those
that come after them; they are ever eying those that seem to outstrip and
out-goe them in wealth, and think they have nothing, they are but poor men,
so long as they come short of such and such. And so is it with these; they are
often eying those, whose either examples they read of, or whose courses and
graces they are in some sort eyewitnesses of, and think that they have
nothing, they make no progress, at least worth speaking of, so long as they
come behind, and keep short of such: And this is it often that makes them
complain so much of their wants and their slow progress, and that they cannot
perceive but that they stand still at a stay. Which yet complaint of theirs,
and fervent desire of growth in grace, is a sure argument of sincere and
undoubted grace in them. Yea it is an argument that they love not life only
but grace, that they love Grace for it self, that they love Grace as it is
Grace, when they desire so much to increase and to grow in Grace, especially
supposing themselves to be in the estate of it already.

Whereas on the other side, it is an argument of insinceritie and unsoundness,
when men having gotten some small measure of speculatiue knowledge, or having
attained to some slight degree of superficial conformity, far enough indeed
from any sound sanctification, they can quietly sit down by it, and have no
mind to go any further: yea how much soever they have attained to, if they can
set down their rest there, sing a requiem to their souls, and say with the
rich Glutton in the Gospel, Luke 12. 19.
Soul, thou have much good; or, Genes. 33. 9. Si dixisti, sufficit, defecisti.
Bern. de consid. 2.
I have enough, with Esau: what should I labor for any more? It was the Church
of La^diceaes song, Apoc. 3. 17. Quomodo enim proficis, si tibi jam sufficis?
Ibid.
I am rich, and full, and need nothing. He is Galat. 6. 3. 1 Cor. 8. 2.
nothing worth indeed that so deemeth of himself. Omnia illi desunt, qui sibi
nihil deesse putat. Bern. de consid. l. 2.
He wants every thing, he has not any thing, that thinks he wants
nothing; says Bernard. The same is to be said of those that think themselves
Satis nos consequi, si inter pess^^^os non sumus. Sen. ep. 76. Non est bonita^
pessimis esse meliorem. Ibid. 79. Perfectu^ nolle esse delinquere est. Hiero^.
ad (...). and ad Julian. (...) Greg. Naz. in Matthew. 19. 11, 12.
well enough, if they be but a little better than those that are stark naught,
that are grossly impious and extremely profane: That use to ask, when they
are incited to a more frequent and diligent use of the means, for the
furtherance of their Christian growth: Why? may not a man be saved, though he
know no more than this, and this? Or though he have no more than such a
measure of faith, or though he do not live so precisely as such and such do?
For such evidently show, that it is not grace but life, not sanctification that
they desire, but salvation only. They serve God, only to serve their own
turns upon God. It is not the pleasing of God, but the saving of themselves
that they do not so much affect, as they are content to have, grace for. Qui
melior esse non cupit, nec est bonus. Vbi incipis nolle (...) definis esse
bonus. Bern. epist. 91. Vbi sunt qui dieere s^lent, sufficit nubis, nol^mus

He was never indeed good, that desires not to be better. Yea, Qui melior esse

de S. Theod. de amor. Dei c. 3.
He is stark naught, that desires not to be as good as the best. For he
cannot be good, that loves not goodness. Nor can any man truly love it, but
he must needs desire more of it. For, Eccles. 5. 10. Avarus animus, ^^llo
satiatur lucro. P. Sir. Senec. epist. 94. Nil satis est. Horat. sermon. 1. Semper
avarus eget. Idem epist. 2. (...). Plut. de profect.
He that loves money, says Solomon, will never have enough of it: N^scit
virtus mensuram gratiae. Ambr. in Luc. l. 5. c. 6. Amori (...) satis est: Amor
exaestuat; se non capit; immensitatem aemulatur, dum metam nescit affectui
ponere: non excusat, sed accusat se de infirmitate; non capit de
impossibilitate remedium, Galbert. in Cant. 19.
And so he that truly loves Grace, will never think he has enough of it,
and will consequently be ever desiring to grow in it. Which desire of growth in
grace, as it is a good sign of sincerity of grace, so the want of it is too
sure an argument of unsoundness.

Yea but, will some other peradventure say, I have heard it often said, that no
true Christian, yea, that Job 14. 2. Nihil stat, nihil fixum manet. Aug. in
Iam. 31. Non stat vel temporis puncto, sed s^e intermissione labitur, quicquid

bent to any intention of meditation, yea that I cannot endure to hold out in
hearing, or to retain or call to mind again what I have heard, as I formerly
have done, or have been able to do. It is the usual complaint of many good
Christians held with lingering infirmities and such bodily diseases as waste the
spirits, weaken the senses, decay the memory, and disable the functions of
those faculties of the soul that are wont to be in these holy exercises
employed.

soul that sees by it) is grown weak and decayed, because it cannot see so
well by or with an old eye, as it could do and did by or with a young one:
(...). Aristot. ibid.
Give it a young eye again, and it will see as well as ever. Nor does it
follow that Vt quamvis tacet Hermogenes, ca^tor tamen, atque Optimus est
modulator: ut Alfen' vafer, omni Abjecto instrumento ^^tis, clausaque taberna
Suitor erat.-Horat. ^erm. l. 1. sat. 3.
a workman has either lost or lessened his skill, because either he wants
tools, and therefore he cannot work, or has bad tools, and cannot therefore
work so well as he could, when he had better than now he has: that a Musician
is not so good or skillful an Artist as he was, because he cannot make so good
Music with his Viole or Citharne, being now cracked and crased, or
euill-stringed, as he could when it was new and sound, and well-stringed at
first. So neither does it follow that spiritual Grace is therefore abated or
decayed in the soul, because it cannot hold out now with that continuance of
attention, or strength and vigor of intention in meditation, invocation, or
other the like holy exercises, Corpus enim tunc instar organi Musici, non (...)
contemperatis and recte dispofiti, sed quasi cofracts and (...). August. nomme
de spi^. and anun. c. 14.
the body being, by age, or sickness and feebleness accruing from either,
much decayed and disabled, as it could formerly, when the parts and functions
of it were fresh. I say not, (for I would not herein be mistaken) if the desire
of doing what it has done, but cannot now do, what it is now restrained of,
or disabled unto, be not as fervent as formerly. For the desire usually rather
on such occasions increases. And it is a (...). Plut. de profectus i^diciis.
shrewd evil sign, as even an Heathen man also could observe, when men
restrained of the means or the use of them, or disabled unto their wonted
performance of such duties, are not at all therewith moved, but can well enough
endure such want. It was by one deemed Ne nunc quidem vires desidero
adolescen^is: non plus quam adolescens etiam vires tauri aut elephantis
desiderabam. Cic. de senect.
as unequal for an old man to desire the strength he had when he was young, as
for a young man to desire the strength that an Ox has, or an Elephant. But
for a man here not to desire to do as he has done, may well minister some
suspicion, of an heart not very sound, which they that thus complain of, by
this their complaint do evidently show themselves not to be free only, but to
be far from. (...). Plut. de profect.
The very absence and restraint of things loved, longed after, and delighted
in, is a great means to incense and inflame much the desire. Nor can there be
a decay of grace, though the work of it may be restrained or suspended, where
the desire continues such. Spiritual grace is of the same nature, in some
sort, with the Soul: As that is an immortal substance; so is this (...). 1
Pet. 1. 23.

though such may either in whole or in part Hinc illud Virg. Aen. 6.-quantum non

restrain the operation, that can possibly either destroy, or decay either. By
some natural defects indeed, (such as either suspend or abandon the use of
reason and understanding, and make a man by that means incapable of
instruction,) a man may be Romans 10. 14, 17.

is able to work in this kind as he will:) unto the attaining of saving
Grace, where as yet it is not. But where it is already wrought, there cannot
any such natural defect, either crase it, or wholly raze it out again. It
were as absurd to imagine that a fit of the dead palsy continuing with a man

which before he was wont to do, when he had better means and a more

defects and infirmities, that argues any decay of Grace.

A ninth Note Note 9.
of sincerity may be an endeavor to find out and discover our own
corruptions; Diligence in Discovery of Corruptions.
and a gladness when we have discovered them by the light of Gods word, or
such other good means as God shall offer us. This business had David been
busy about, what time he brake out into that exclamation; Psalm. 19. 12.
O, who can tell how often he sins? or, what man is he that understands his
own errors? Spin^us de Iustit. Christian. Postquam diligenter cubiculu^
everrimus, id nobis perpurgatum videtur. At sole per fenestras illucente,
radios atomorum sordibus infinitis permistos videmus.
It fared with David, says Spina, as with the Houswife that having diligently
swept her house and cast the dust out at doors, can see nothing amiss now, no
specke of dust in it; whereas if the Sun do but a little shine in through
some cranie in the wall, or some broken quarrel in the window, she may soon
see the whole house swim and swarm with innumerable motes of dust floating
to and fro in the air, which for dimnesse of light or sight before she was
not able to discern. And so fared it with David; he was a man of no loose
life, but even from his younger years careful of his courses, 1 Samuel 13. 14.
Upright and after Gods own heart; so that little might seem to be amiss, or
to require reformation and amendment with him: yet when he came to look more
intentiuely into Gods law, a little beam of light reflecting upon his soul
from it, discovered unto him such Psalm. 40. 12.
an innumerable company as well of corruptions in his heart, as of errors and
ouer-sights in his life, that it made him, as one amazed, cry out in that
manner, as guessing by what he now saw, that he had not seen before, how much
corruption remained yet in him unseen. In like manner had he been sifting of
himself, when he said; Psalm. 119. 59. Nos contra. Dissimulamus Dtmini
quaerere voluntate, dum and nostram facere, and aliquam de ignorantia
excusationem habere volumus. Bern. de diverse. 26.
I considered my ways, and turned my feet unto thy Testimonies. And of the joy
that he conceived, when upon such view and search he had light upon somewhat
that he was ignorant of before, and came to the notice of some duty concerning
himself, that before he was not aware of: Psalm. 119. 162.
I rejoice, says he, at thy Word, (to wit, when somewhat from it is discovered
unto me,) as one that finds a great spoil; that has gotten a rich booty.
An allusion to rich spoils taken from the enemy in the field, wherein the
pleasure is usually as much as, or more than the profit. And he says further
therefore, That Psalm. 119. 7.
he will praise God with an upright heart, when he shall have learned his
righteous Testimonies: He will thank him heartily, when he shall by his Law
inform him of ought. Yea how glad was he when Abigail had discovered unto him
his error, and by that means stayed his hand from an unwarrantable act, that
in his heat of passion he had before resolved to execute? And 1 Samuel 25. 32, 33.
how does he bless her, and bless God for her; her, as a messenger of God,
and God, as one that had sent her to meet him, and so to withold him from
that outrage? And (...). Plut. de profect. indic.
this is also a singular good note of a sincere heart, when a man is careful
to search into his own corruptions and ouersights, is willing to be informed
of them, glad to see them discovered, and ready to reform them when they are
evidently discovered to him, and his conscience convinced of them out of Gods
word. As on the contrary part when men Vt liberius peccent, libenter ignorant.

those that are dealing in any sort with their sins, Psalm. 32. 9. Amos 5. 10.

manner inform them of them, albeit they cannot wholly excuse them or deny them
to be such: when men will of set purpose forbear, yea and forswear to, the
hearing of those, whose plain dealing and powerful delivery of Gods word,
has begun to lay open to them their corruptions, and to touch them a little
to the quick: Or when (as Augustine well observes of some, speaking of those
words of the Psalmist; Psalm. 36. 2, 3.
He flattereth himself in his own eyes, till his iniquity be found
abominable; and he refuses to understand:) Quasi conantur quaerere, and timent
invenire. Aug. in Psalm. 35.
they will seem to search, but are loath to find; and therefore, as Matthew. 19.
22.
the young man in the Gospel, that moved a question to our Savior, Mul^os
cognovi veritate agnita tristiores discessisse, quod jam confuger^ ad
ignorantiae excusationem non liceret. Bern. in Cant. 74.
they are sorry that ever they sought, and go away with heavy hearts, when
they find not as they would, when they have not an issue and an answer to
their own minds: and as Ierem. 42. 2, 3, 5, 6. and 43. 2, 3, 4.
the Jewish Captains that repaired for advice and direction to Jeremy, their
seeming search was never made in sincerity.

The last Note Note 10.
of Sincerity shall be a love of God and good things, Love of God, and Gods
children; with Purpose of constant Adherence unto him, even in Want of
Assurance of his Special Favor.
refuse thereupon to follow what they are informed of, or to reform what upon
such search they meet with, and find to be amiss with them in heart or life:
It is a fearful sign that their heart is not upright, and Quia dolose
agebant, ut invenirent, ubi invenerint, non oderunt. Si enim sincere and non
dolose agerent, quod inven^rent, ^dissent. Aug. in Psalm. 35.
and of the Children of God for God; together with a steadfast purpose to depend
still upon God, to continue constant in the frequent and diligent use of all
the holy Ordinances of Go^, and to persevere and go on in the good ways of
God, though a man cannot yet find or feel in himself any assurance of Gods
special favor toward him, or any comfort in the ordinances of God that he
uses.

These I am the rather willing thus to pile up together, and to comprehend
under one Head, though they might severally be insisted on, because I would
hasten to an end, fearing that I have been ouer-long in what is past already:
The work growing greater than I made account it would have done.

That our Love of God Love of God.
is a sure argument of Gods special Love of us it is most evident. Prove. 8. 17.
I love them, says the Wisdom of God, that love me. And, John 14. 21, 23. and

He that loves me, says our Savior Christ, both the Father and I will love
him. Nemo se fallat. Non nos Deum diligeremus, nisi ipse prius nos dilexisset,

how can he choose but love them again, when they love him, whom he loved

diligere non potest. Bern. an Cant. 71.
loved them, when they loved not him; that loved them so dearly when they
Psalm. 81. 15. Tit. 3. 3.
hated him, and Romans 5. 8, 10. and 8. 7.
were enemies to him, as to give his Son to die for them. If God, says that
Bradford Sermon of Repentance.
blessed man and Martyr of God, so loved us when we hated him and fled away
from him, that he sent his Son after us to seek us, and with loss of his
own life to redeem and reduce us, how can we think otherwise, but that now
loving him, and lamenting because we do no more love him, he will surely
love us for ever?

And that the Love of Gods Children for God, Love of Gods Children for God.
is a good Sign of the love of God, it is no less apparent. 1 John 5. 1.
He that loves him that begat, says Saint John, loves him also that is
begotten. And he that loves him that is begotten, say I, loves him also that
begat. It was 2 Samuel 9. 3, 7.
for Ionathans sake principally, that David loved and favored Mephibosheth.
Nor could a man for God love the Children of God, if he did not first love God
himself. In regard whereof also Saint John makes this Love of Gods Children a
Sign that a man 1 John 2. 10.
is in the light, to (...) of Gods favor; that he 1 John 3. 14.
is past from Death to Life, is in the state of salvation; that he 1 John 4. 7.
is borne of God, is regenerate, is the Child of God; that 1 John 4. 12.
God dwells in him, he abides in his heart by his Spirit; and that he does
Ibid.
sincerely love God, and is beloved consequently of God. And as David
testifies the sincerity of his Love unto God, by his loving, Psalm. 16. 2, 3.
and 119. 63.
liking of, and delighting in the Saints of God: so he makes Psalm. 15. 1, 4.
the honoring and respecting of those that fear God; a note and mark of such
as are free Denisons of the heavenly Jerusalem.

The like might be said severally of D^ut. 4. 4. and 30. 20. Psalm. 73. 27, 28.
Act. 11. 23.
the steadfast purpose of depending upon God, Purpose of Dependence.
and Psalm. 1. 2. and 119. 15, 16. Esai. 58. 13.
of continuing constant in the diligent use of the Ordinances of God, and Psalm.
119. 8, 40, 44, 48. and 128. 1.
walking carefully in his ways. But that which I here in this last Note
principally aim at, Constant use of Gods Ordinances.
and will therefore most insist on, is this, that then the sincerity of a man's
heart herein does most evidently appear, when he persisteth thus constantly in
loving God, and Gods children, cleaving to God, following him, frequenting his
Ordinances, and depending upon him, And Observance of Gods ways.
though God seem not to regard him, nor do reveal himself yet unto him in
that comfortable manner, Psalm. 119. 132.
as he does frequently and usually unto those that be his. Esai. 8. 17.
Yet will I wait upon the Lord, says the Prophet Esaias, Notwithstanding Want of
Assurance and Comfort.
though he have hid his face from us. And, Job 13. 15.
Though he slay me, says Job, yet will I still trust in him: Yea, Job 13. 24.
Nec fic probatus ab officio recessit. Tu, inquit, avertis faciem tuam a me, sed
ego non sum aversus a te. Ruffin. in Psalm. 29.
though he hide his face from me, and carry himself toward me as an enemy.
Hereby do the people of God in the Psalm approve their sincerity unto (...),
and the uprightness of their hearts with him, in that Psalm. 44. 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 24. Nec iratum colere destiter. ant numen: uti Sen. ad Marc. c. 13.
though God seemed to have clean forgotten them, and to have utterly cast them
off, yet they had not left him, nor taken occasion thereby, either to neglect
him or to stray from him, either in heart or in life, and to seek to any other
helps. And it is certainly an argument of a great measure of grace, when a
Christian Soul, though finding in it self so weak encouragement, in regard
of comfort or assurance, to depend upon God, yet can firmly resolve constantly
Esai. 50. 10.
to rely and rest wholly upon him: when though Psalm. 77. 3.
it feel little or no comfort at all in ought that it does, yet Psalm. 119. 81,
82, 83.
it will not thereby be discouraged from persisting in the observance of holy
exercises, and the performance of good duties, content with patience, and yet
not without a kind of Psa. 6. 3. and 13. 1. Subtractio namque rei quam^ amas,
augmentatio desiderii est: and quod ardentius desiderat quis ^^grius caret.
Bern. Cant. 51.
religious impatience too, Psalm. 62. 1, 5, 6, 7.
to submit it self to Gods good pleasure, Psalm. 40. 1.
wait his holy leisure, and Lament. 3. 26, 27, 28, 29, 50.
expect when he shall see it fit and seasonable in mercy, further to reveal
himself, and to minister unto it the inward comforts of his Spirit. As on the
other side it is a shrewd Sign of insinceritie and unsoundness, when men are
ready to cast off all religious regard, if they cannot in good exercises find
present comfort; or shall be ready, if God do not instantly answer them
according to their desires, to say with Iorams profane Pursueuant, 2 King. 6.
33.
What should I do waiting on God any longer? Or with Saul, 1 Samuel 28. 6, 7.
to leave God, and betake them to other courses, yea those, such as he in his
Word has inhibited.

Neither are we to think that the prayers and other holy exercises of such so
affected, as before was said, in regard of the want of that alacrity and
cheerfulness of spirit in them, are therefore either altogether unprofitable
to themselves, or unacceptable in Gods sight. For to omit, that there is often
more true spiritual viuacitie in the prayers and other exercises of persons
even so affected, than in the prayers and exercises of many others; Videatur
similitudo de Aqua tubis and cana^bus conclasa; apud Greg. Naz. orat. 31.
Chrysostom. contra Anomaeos orat. 5. and Greg. To. in P^store p. 3. c. 1.. 15.
their inward sense of their wants and instant desire of having them supplied,
putting a great deal of spirit and life more than ordinary into them: An
hungry belly, an empty maw, will make a beggar beg more earnestly, than
when he has been feeding but a little before. Read but Psalm. 42. and 44.
and 63. and 77. and 84. and 88. and 89. and 102. and 119. etc.
the Psalms and Prayers that the Saints of God have made and penned in such
cases, and upon such occasions, and mark what a deal of spiritual vigor and
viuacitie appears in them. Not to stand, I say, upon this; Even the weakest
and the feeblest that are, must for their comfort and encouragement in this
kind be informed, that Spinaeus de Iustit. Christian. translated into English
by Mr I. Field. A book that I wish were reprinted again.
as the brothes, and meats, and medic^nes that sick persons take, though they
delight not the taste, nor do they find any good relish in them, by reason of
their present infirmity and weakness, yet may do them much good, and be a
means both to preserve life, to keep from fainting and further weakness, and
to strengthen also in some measure: so holy actions though performed with much
infirmity and weakness, yet with an holy and religious diligence, may much
benefit the soul so performing the same, albeit it find little spiritual
relish in them, or feel no comfort from them for the present. Yea, howsoever
it be true, as I said Motive 2.
before, that the want of alacrity and cheerfulness in performance of holy
duties, especially procured by some wilful neglect, or by some peevish and way
ward disposition, framing matter of grief to it self from idle toys and
trifles unto the disturbance of it self in such duties, does much diminish,
and take away much the grace of them: yet it is no less true that Quibusdam
lac, quibusdam vinum apponitur. Lacsuaviter bibitur, dulciter liquatur, sine
laesione, sine amaritudine; vinu asperius est, and minus suave. Lac bibunt qui
in sancto proposito suaeviter in^^dunt, dulciter curru^t, etc. Vinu^ bibunt,
qui vias vitae aggressi, and ingressi, corporis animeque tribulationibus
contorquentur, sed non cedunt, neque recedu^t tamen. Sed quis horum tibi
videtur vel ille qui in suavitate, vel ille qui in asperitate currit viam
mandatorum Dei? primus (...), secundus furtior; uterque lamen justus, uterque
pius. Bern. deconsc^ent. c. 3.
the constant and conscionable persisting in performance of such duties,
notwithstanding that all good means used, the poor Christian soul cannot
attain to that alac^ity that feign it would, may make them no less
acceptable, if not more acceptable to God, than if they were done even with the
greatest delight. Suppose two persons attend the King in his hunting, or at his
sports, the one that takes much delight in the game, the other that has
little or no delight in it: or the one lusty and healthy, and that attends
him therefore with ease; the other weak and faint, or lame, or having some
hurt about him, in regard whereof he cannot follow him but with much pain and
difficulty, and yet will not give over, but be hard at his heels still, as
ready and forward as the former. His Voluntas est, quae apud nos ponit
o^ficium. Sen. de benes. l. 6. c. 12.
will may be every whit as good as the other, and his Sovereign is no less,
if not more, for such his service beholden to him, than to the other. Nor may
the service of such a poor soul therefore be the less acceptable to God,
because it cannot perform it with such alacrity and delight as Quomodo de
aegroto Aug. in Psalm. 118. conc. 8. Aegrotus qui fastidio laborat, and vult
evadere hoc malum, concupiscit desiderare cibum, dum concupiscit non habere
fastidium. Et appetit animus, ut appeta^ corpus, quando appetit animus, nec
appetit corpus.
it desires. And in like manner for Faith and dependence upon God. It is not
an argument of no Faith, when a man cannot yet attain to a full persuasion and
assurance of Gods special favor toward him, and of the free remission of his
sins in Christ, that many other faithful Galat. 2. 20. 1 John 3. 14. and 5.
19, 20.
have had, and many doubtless also ordinarily have. This is a consequent
rather of Faith, that as Non praecedunt justificandum, sed sequuntio
justificafum. Aug. de fid. and oper. c. 14.
Augustine says of works, rather follows the person justified, than
precedeth and goes before justification, as Faith being Romans 3. 28. and 3. 1.
an isntrumental cause of producing it as an effect does. It is a consequent,
I say, of it, deduced from it, as the same Father well Servator loquitur,
Veri^as pollicetur: Qui audit verba mea, and credit ei qui misit me, habet
vitam aeternum, trans^t de morte ad vitam, and in^udicium non veniet. Ego
audrvi, credidi; infidelis cum essem, factus sum fidelis: Trans^^ ergo a morte
ad vitam, and injudicium non veniam, non praesumptione mea, sed ipsius
promissione. Aug. in Joan. 5. 24.
shows, by a Syllogism, wherein Faith is assumed, and this persuasion
concluded from it: and that not simply and absolutely necessary neither, but
such as is, by general consent, often severed from it. But for a man, though he
cannot yet attain to it, yea though he never should so long as he lives, yet
to resolve Act. 11. 23. Hec suaderi, a verbo quaeri; persuaderi, invenir^ est,
Bern. in Cant. 84.
to cleave unto God with full purpose of heart, to stick close unto him, to
depend wholly upon him, and not to give over still seeking and suing to him for
it, and the constant use of all good means to attain it; Psalm. 13. 1, 5. and
43. 2, 5.
like a Courtier, who though the King show him no Countenance, but seem wholly
to neglect him, and not at all to regard him, yet will still follow the Court,
and tender his service, and resolve to give attendance, hoping yet to find
acceptance at length, yea to do it constantly, whether he shall find
acceptance or no; or like Matt. 15. 22-28.
the woman of Canaan, that would follow Christ still, and would take no nay of
him, though he seemed not only not to regard her, or any other that made suit
for her, but to reject and put her off with much disgrace: it is a sound
argument of a true and a lively Faith, and of no small measure of the same.

Where if it be demanded how this trusting to, Question.
and dependence upon God, may stand with the want of such assurance. I shall
not need to say much, because the Argument has by Mr Chibald Trial of Faith.
a Reverend Brother been of late handled at large.

Only I make it plain by this familiar Comparison. Answer.
Put case a poor man has occasion to make use of some great Courtier for the
effecting of some business of great consequence for him, even as much as his
life lies on, or all that ever he is worth, as suppose the procuring him his
pardon for some capital crime from the Prince. And this great Courtier tells
him, that though he be but a stranger, one that can claim no such thing from
him, yea one that has deserved many ways evil of him, yet if he trust only
to him, and rely wholly upon him, he will do that for him, which the poor
wretch requires of him. This poor man now in this case may trust only to him,
and neglecting all other means that either others may advise him to, or
himself sometime think on, rely wholly upon him; and yet he may not be fully
persuaded that he will effect it for him neither. The consideration of his own
want of worth and evil desert, -quod nimis miseri volunt, Hoc facile credunt,
Immo quod metuunt nimis, Nunqua^ amovert posse, nec tolli p^tant. Prona est
timori semper in pejus fides. Sen. Herc. fur. 2. 1. Nec tutum patitur esse
securum pavor. Ide^ de gaudio. Luke 24. 41.
his immoderate fear arising from the apprehension of the great danger that
he is in, and the subtle persuasion of others that would bear him in hand
that he will but delude him, and not do for him as he says, may either
severally or jointly be a means to hold his mind in suspense, and to keep
him from such assurance. Yea his very mistaking and misconstruction of the
great man's meaning, when he says, If you will trust to, or rely upon me alone
for it, being possessed with a conceit that his want of a full persuasion that
he will do it, which he cannot yet for his heart-bloud bring his mind to
any settled assurance of, does evidently show that he does nor trust to him, may
be a means to make him believe, that he will never do it for him, because he
does not, what he supposes is therein absolutely required of him, which to
that great man also, if he should be demanded of it, not daring to tell an
untruth, would appear. And yet for all this he may resolve to stick to his
mediation only, and to rely wholly upon him, and not to seek or try any other
way, whatsoever any man shall persuade him to the contrary, or whatsoever the
issue and event of it shall be. And even so may it well be, and is
questionless with a Christian soul many times. John 3. 16, 36. and 5. 24.
God has proclaimed and published a Patent of pardon and salvation by Christ,
to all that trust to him for the same. A man may so do, encouraged thereunto
by this gracious offer and the condition to it annexed, yea many an one so
does, and yet partly out of the sight and consideration of his own
unworthiness, partly out of a kind of timorousness and pusillanimity of
spirit, partly by reason of some strong melancholic imagination, and partly
also through some powerful delusion of Satan, not be able possibly to persuade
himself that Christ is yet his, or that he has interest in him, has his
sins pardoned for him, and shall live eternally by him. Yea the very
mistaking of the true Nature of saving Faith, and supposing the very essence of
it to consist in this particular persuasion, (which yet is only an effect and
a fruit, yea such a fruit of it, as does not necessarily always spring from
it, Psalm. 31. 22. and 77. 7, 8, 9. and 88. 14. and 116. 11.
nor is at all times of the year ever constantly found on it,) and that
therefore he does not trust in Christ so long as he wants it, is a maine
means to keep many from it, and from the comfort of it, which yet have true
Faith, and do unfeignedly trust in Christ for all that: As by many other sound
and undoubted Arguments, which if they be questioned with and urged to it, not
daring to deny them, lest they should lie against their own conscience, may
be drawn from their own confessions and answers concerning themselves, (when
there is no fear of hypocrisy, lest they should therein dissemble, being more
prone to charge than to clear, and to allege matter against themselves, than
to produce any thing for themselves;) will evidently appear. Among which
Arguments also even this, though it come last, yet is none of the least, if
their conscience unfeignedly can testify for them, that though they have not
yet such a persuasion and assurance of Gods mercy toward them in Christ for the
remission of their sins and the salvation of their souls, yet they Psalm. 51.
11, 12.
unfeignedly desire, and 2 Pet. 1. 10.
labor instantly for it, and though they cannot yet attain to it, yet they
Ephesians. 6. 24.
love the Lord Jesus heartily, and Coloss. 1. 4.
his members for his sake, and 2 Chronicles. 14. 11.
rest and repose themselves wholly upon him, and Gods mercy in him, Act. 4. 12.
John 6. 68.
renouncing all other means of remission of sin and salvation without him,
with Job 13. 15.
a full purpose of heart and resolution still so to do, Psalm. 40. 1.
expecting when God shall in mercy be pleased to look graciously upon them,
and to vouchsafe them that assurance that as yet they have not. Pro^. 16. 10.
Who so trusts in the Lord, says Solomon, o blessed is he. And what a great
measure of grace is it for a man to trust thus in God, while he lies yet under
the sense and apprehension of his wrath?

Those therefore, Conclusion.
whatsoever they are, that having by these or the like Notes and Signs
examined themselves, have found their hearts to be sincere and upright with
God, albeit this their beginning of grace be mixed with much weakness, they may
know thereby and assure themselves that they have right to, and interest in the
Light and Joy of the Just here spoken of: and they may therefore safely lay
hold on it, admit it, give way to it, receive it and harbor it in their
hearts; yea that they wrong themselves, Gods grace in them, and his goodness
toward them, when Psalm. 77. 2.
they refuse and repel it, having so good and sure ground for it, having so
great cause, as we have here showed, to rejoice. Light and Joy being sown
here, not for the righteous alone, but for all that are upright in heart.

Which Joy the Lord in mercy vouchsafe Esai. 61. 3.
to all in Sion that yet want it, and increase it daily in the hearts of all
those that already have it, until we come all to meet and partake together
in that Psalm. 16. 11.
fullness of Joy, which shall never again be interrupted or eclipsed in us,
John 16. 22.
shall never in whole or in part be taken again away from us.

Amen.
