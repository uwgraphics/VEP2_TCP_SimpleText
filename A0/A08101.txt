ORDERS AND ARTICLES GRANTED BY THE HIGH AND MIGHTY LORDS THE STATES GENERAL
OF THE UNITED PROVINCES,

Concerning the erecting of a West Indi^ Company:

Together with the Privileges and rights given unto the same.

PRINTED ANNO DOM. M.DC.XXI.

THe States General of the united Provinces, unto all those that shall see
these, greeting. We make known, that we considering the good of these Lands,
and the welfare of the inhabitants of them, to consist principally in the
navigations and traffike which in all times out of these Countries with good
success and blessings in all kingdoms and countries have continued. And
desiring that the said inhabitants not only maintain and keep their former
nauigations and traffikes, but likewise as much as is possible increase the
same, and principally according to the treaties, alliances, contracts and
entercourses concerning the traffike and navigations with other Princes,
Commonwealths and Nations in former times made, which we understand in all
points to be kept and observed. And we perceiving that without a common help,
assistance and means of a general Company, nothing can be undertaken in the
places hereafter specified for to get profit and to maintain and defend the
same, in regard of piracies, extorsions and other like matters happening such
long nauigations. We have in regard of these and other weighty reasons and
considerations moving us unto the same as likewise ripe deliberations of our
Counsels, and other pregnant and weighty occasions moving us in like manner
found good, that the navigations, traffike and commerce in the quarters of the
West Indies and Africa, and other places named hereafter in times following, no
more shall be exercised and used then by common and united power of Merchants
and inhabitants of these Countries, and that to the same purpose shall be
erected a general Company, which we in regard of our singular affection and
love to the common good, and to preserve the inhabitants of the same in
traffike and welfare, shall maintain and strengthen with help, favor and
assistance, for as much as the present state and condition of these countries
in any manner of ways can permit, providing for the same a fit grant, with
privileges and liberties, here following: viz. That within the term of four
and twenty years, none of the natives or inhabitants of these Countries,
otherwise then only by the authority of the united Company of these united
Provinces, or from any other country shall nauigate or traffike upon the coasts
and lands of Africa, from Topica, Cancri, until Cabo de bonna Esperanca,
neither upon the countries of America or West India, beginning from the South
end of Terra noua, through the straight of Magellanus le Maire or other
straights or passages thereabout, until the straight of Anian, as well upon
the North as South sea, neither upon any Islands either at the one or other
side, or betwixt them both situated; likewise neither upon the Austriall or
Southlands lying betwixt both Meridians, touching at the East side Cabo de
bonna Esperanca, and at the West side, the East side of Noua Guinea, inclusiue.
And if any man without leave of the said Company shall sail or traffike into
any of these aforesaid limits granted unto this Company, the ships and goods
shall be forfeited, having traffiked in any of the aforesaid parts, which
immediately every way shall be taken and seized upon by the Company, and kept
for the use and benefit of the same. And in case such ships or goods shall be
sold, or landed in other countries or ports, shall the Merchant venturers and
participants be answerable for the value of the ships and goods, and be
convicted for the same, with this caution, that those that before this grant
of these or other countries are sailed unto any of these coasts, may sell their
goods and return back again in these lands; or otherwise until their grant
is expired (if they have gotten any before this time) continue, and not longer,
observing that no body now at the beginning shall send any ships or goods into
the parts in this Patent comprehended, notwithstanding at the same time perhaps
the Company be not fully concluded, providing for the same as is fit, and
against them that wilfully against our good intention shall seek to wrong the
general good. We understand nevertheless that it shall be free for every one
to fetch salt from Ponte del Re, but upon conditions and instructions by us
allowed or to be allowed, without otherwise in any manner to be tied unto this
grant.

2
That moreover the said Company in our name and by our authority shall have
power, within the limits here before set down, to make contracts and alliances
with the Princes and natives of the countries herein comprehended, as likewise
to build forts and strong holds, to choose governors, and men for wars,
Officers of justice, and all other necessary uses for the conservation of good
orders, policy and justice, as for the advancement of trading and traffiking
shall be required; as likewise to depose and put down, and to substitute other
in their places, as they shall find convenient. Furthermore they shall search
plentiful and not uninhabited places to plant the same, and do every thing
that will be good for the service and profit of the Country, and which the
increase of traffike will require. And these of the Company shall from time to
time communicate to us, and deliver such contracts and alliances as they shall
make with the said Princes and nations, besides the situations of the forts,
places of defense, and plantations by them taken in hand.

3
Observing that the Company having chosen a Governor, and conceived
instructions for him, he shall be approved by us, and receive his commission.
And the said Governor general shall as well as other Vice or Substitute
governors, Commanders and Officers, be sworn both unto Us and the Company.

4
And in case the said Company in any of the places above mentioned happen by
fained friendship to be deceived or ill used, or that any sums of money or
merchandises trusted abroad without restitution or payment for the same be
detained, that they shall see to repair the damage, according to the cause,
and as for their ability shall be most requisite.

5
And because for the plantation, safety and defense of this traffike, some men
of war of necessity must be levied, we will provide for the said Company
such Commanders, soldiers and enginers as shall be requisite, though upon
condition they shall be paid by the said Company.

6
Which besides the oath made unto us and his Excellency, shall likewise be
sworn to follow the directions and commandments of the Company.

7
That the Prouosts of the Company shall have power and authority in these
countries to take and apprehend such soldiers and men of war as shall be
entered into the service of this Company, and bring them to shipboard, in
whatsoever cities, towns or jurisdictions they shall be found: upon condition
the said Prouosts shall aforehand give notice of it unto the Officers and
Magistrates of the place.

8
That we shall not take any ships, ordinance or munition from this Company for
the use of these Countries, without the consent of the said Company.

9
Moreover we have granted and yielded unto the said Compan e, and grant and
yield by these presents, that all their ships and goods shall pass freely,
without paying any custom or tole due in these united Provinces:
notwithstanding any forreiners may be partakers in the said Company, which in
that regard shall enjoy like privileges with the free inhabitants of these
countries.

10
That this Company for the first eight years shall pay nothing for conuoy for
their goods either coming in, or to be sent into the West Indies and Africa,
and other countries in the same limitation comprehended: and is reserved and
concluded, that in case at the end of the first eight years the state and
condition of these countries cannot admit the said privilege of eight years
to be continued for certain years more, that the goods to be sent from these
parts, as likewise the wares of these aforesaid countries being to be
transported in the conuoyes and licenses, shall not be higher taxt or charged
then they are now, except we are in wars again, in which case all the
aforesaid goods and wares shall not be taxed higher then they were immediately
before the truce made.

11
And because this Company may be well governed and to the most profit and
contentment of all the partakers, we have ordered that the government of the
same shall consist in five Courts of Committees or Commissioners, as namely one
at Amsterdam, which shall have the administration of four ninth parts; one in
Zealand, for two ninth parts; one about the Maes, for one ninth part; one in
North Holland for one ninth part; and the fifth in Vriesland, the city and Land
likewise for a ninth part, upon conditions set down in the Register of our
resolutions, as appears by the Act concerning the same by us delivered. And
the Provinces destitute of Courts, shall be furnished with so many
Commissioners, as they shall bring a hundred thousand gilders unto this
Company, and they shall be dispersed amongst the other Courts.

12
The Court of Amsterdam shall consist of twenty Commissioners; the Court of
Zealand of twelve; the Courts about the Ma^s and North Holland, every one of
fourteen; and the Court of Vriesland, city and land, likewise of fourteen,
unless hereafter it appear the said not to be enough, in which case we will
at our liking and advice of the nineteen increase the number of the same.

13
And by these is granted authority unto the States of the aforesaid Provinces,
either before their ordinary Deputies, or the Magistrate of the cities in
their Provinces, to take such an order for the registring and subscribing of
the partakers and Commissioners, as they shall find agreeable unto the
customs and laws of their Provinces; provided always that none shall be
chosen to be a Commissioner in the Court at Amsterdam, unless he put six
thousand gilders stock of his own in the said Company; but in the Court of
Zealand, as likewise in the Courts about the Maes, the Court in North Holland
and Vriesland, they shall not be chosen Commissioners, if they bring not unto
the Company four thousand gilders a piece.

14
That the Commissioners shall attend the space of six years, and at the end
of the same, one third part shall be removed by bills to be drawn; and two
years after, a like third part to be removed; and likewise two years after,
with the last third part to be done; and so from time to time to discharge the
elder in office. And in place of the dismissed or deceased, or for any reasons
put by, shall be nominated three persons by the Commissioners, as well that are
in place, as that are removed, as likewise by the chief participants and
undertakers, that in person and at their charges will come at the Court. And
out of these three, the aforesaid Provinces, their Deputies or Magistrates shall
choose new Commissioners, and continually supply the places vacant: and shall be
accounted chief participants all these that as much stock of their own bring
in, as the aforesaid Commissioners.

15
The accounts of the rigging and setting forth of the ships and other things
concerning the same, shall be made within the space of three months after the
departure of the same; and within a month after shall be sent copies of the
same unto us and the several Courts. And concerning the returns, and the sale
of the same, the Courts (whenever we shall find it convenient, or any of the
Courts desire it) shall be bound to give us and one another notice of all their
state.

16
Every six years shall the reckonings be given up of all voyages and returns,
profits and damages of the Company: viz. one of the traffike, and another of
the wars, seperatly; which reckonings shall be done publikly, and after bills
affixed, that every one being interessed, may come at the making up of these
accounts. And in case before the end of the seventh year the same be not done,
the Commissioners shall lose their provisions, and shall be converted to the
use of the poor, and they nevertheless be bound to make their reckonings as
before, within such a time, and upon such penalties as shall be decreed by us
against such delinquents and infringers. And this notwithstanding there shall
be made distributions as many times as shall be proved and certified ten in the
hundred to be gotten by traffike.

17
No man shall during the time of this grant, have power to draw his cappitall
or stock from the Company; and likewise no new partakers in the mean time
shall be accepted: but in case at the expiring of the four and twenty years,
it shall be thought convenient to continue the said Company, or to erect a new
one, shall be made a final reckoning and estimation or prise by the nineteen,
with our knowledge of every thing concerning this Company, as likewise of the
necessary charges the Company has bin at: and then every one may choose
whether he will draw his money out or in the ensuing Company keep wholly or in
part. And in such case the Company shall be bound to take the remaining things
at her charge, and content the rest of the partakers that shall be willing to
separate themselves from the Company, every one according to his proportion;
and that at such days of payment as the nineteen with our advice shall find
convenient.

18
That whenever a general meeting of the aforesaid Courts shall be appointed,
there shall meet nineteen persons, eight from the Court of Amsterdam, four
from Zealand, two from the Maes, two from the Northern parts of Holland, two
from Vriesland, and also the city and land, provided that the ninetene persons
or as many more as we shall think fit by us shall be appointed and chosen, for
to give their best directions for the dispatching of the affairs of this
Company.

19
By which general assembly of the said Courts, all matters concerning this
Company shall be propounded and concluded, with caution that in regard of
matters of war our resolution shall be required.

20
At the said general meetings shall be resolved when any ships, and how many,
and toward what coasts shall be sent or the general good of the Company,
having no Court power to do any thing without a general resolution of the
rest. And in case any of these Courts might happen to be careless and
negligent in the accomplishing of these resolutions, we have given and give by
these same the said general meetings, authority and power to cause offenders
and delinquents to make reparation for their faults, and requested shall lend
thereunto our helping hand.

21
The said general meeting shall be kept the first six years at Amsterdam, the
next two ensuing years in Zealand, and so from time to time in the two
aforesaid places.

22
The Commissioners by the Company sent to the said meetings or elsewhere,
shall have for their diet and wages four gilders every day, besides the money
for the boat, ship or wagons: provided that these that shall travel from the
one to the other city, to frequent and visit the Courts as Commissioners and
Assistants, shall receive neither the one nor the other from the Company.

23
And if happened in the said general meetings any matters of great weight and
moment to occur, which concerning the Courts could not agree, and did find
difficulty if they should ouerrule one another, we have taken upon us the
deciding of the same, and what we shall find good shall be followed.

24
Within the space of a month hence shall be given notice by bills affixed, to
all inhabitants both of these and other countries, that at the expiration of
the five next following months, beginning from the first of June, may be
admitted and received, and pay their capital sums in three paiments, viz. a
third part at the end of the five months aforesaid, and the other two third
parts within the three next ensuing years, unless afterward it be found more
convenient to take longer time, of which the partakers shall be advertised by
bills affixed.

25
The Ships returning from their iourneys are to land at the same places they
departed: and if it do happen that any ships by reason of wind and wether land
in other parts, as those of Amsterdam or the North parts in Zealand, or in the
Maes, or those of Zealand in Holland, or those of Vriesland with their
associates in any other parts, that nevertheless every Court shall have the
oversight and administration of his ships and goods, and shall have power to
send the ships and goods to the places where their own Courts are kept, or
hire other ships or vessels to convey the goods to the places aforesaid, with
this clause and caution, that the Commissioners shall present themselves at the
places where the ships and goods shall be arrived, without using any factors or
deputies in their name. And in case it be not convenient for them to travel
unto those places, they shall leave the charge and administration unto the
Commissioners of the Court next to the landing of ship and goods.

26
If any of the Courts aforesaid receives any wares, of which any of the other
is unprovided, the said shall be bound to provide the other according to her
ability, and the same being sold, send more. That likewise the Commissioners
of the Court before mentioned, standing in need of any persons for rigging of
their ships or otherwise, shall show the same unto any other Court or Courts,
without using any factors or agents to the same purpose.

27
In case any Provinces shall appoint an Agent for to receive the moneys from
the Participants in their precinct, and to put the same in their Court, and to
procure payment of the distributions, he shall be admitted in the said Court,
for to be informed and instructed of the out dealings, distributions and
incomings, provided he bring into the Company filtie thousand gilders stock
or above.

28
The Commissioners shall have one in the hundred of all goods going out or
coming in, as likewise of all prises or taken goods; but of silver and gold
but a half in the hundred: of which provision the Court of Amsterdam shall
receive four ninth parts, the Court in Zealand two ninth parts, the Court
about the Maes a ninth part, the Court of Vriesland joined with the city and
land a ninth part, the Court of North Holland likewife a ninth part,

29
Provided always that they shall receive but once provision for the ordenance
and ships, but none at all of the ships, ordenance and other things wherewith
we shall assist the said Company; neither of the moneys they shall take up for
the use of the Company, neither for the goods they shall sell, neither shall
they bring in any accounts for the attendance and charges of diet and travel
of those they may appoint or send for the setting forth of the ships, or buying
of the goods thereunto required.

30
The keepers of the accounts and of the cashes likewise, shall have their wages
paid out of the provision of the Commissioners.

31
The Commissiones shall not sell or deliver any ships or goods or wares unto
the Company either wholly or partly belonging unto them; neither shall they buy
or procure to be bought for them any merchandises or goods from the Company,
directly or indirectly for themselves, nor hold in any part of the bargain. In
case they fail therein, they shall forfeit their provision of one year (which
shall be given unto the poor) and themselves discharged of their places.

32
The Commissioners shall be bound to give notice by bills affixed, of the
merchandises and goods they newly have received, because every one may know it
before they are sold.

33
And if any of the Commissioners happens to decay in his estate, that he be not
able to make good and give satisfaction for matters trusted unto him in regard
of his administration, which might cause damage, their stock in the Company
shall be answerable for the same, being as a pledge and security for their
true administration. And likewise if any of the participants for goods bought
or otherwise, be indebted unto the Company, and decays in his estate, that he
be not able to pay his debts, his stock in the Company shall be answerable
for the same.

34
The Commissioners of the aforesaid Courts shall answer for their keepers of
cash and accounts.

35
That all the wares of this Company to be sold by weight, shall be sold and
delivered by the weight of Amsterdam only; and leave shall be given to weigh
the same in the ships or store houses, without paying any taxes, impost or
weigh money, upon condition nevertheless that the same being sold, shall be
delivered at the weigh-house, and pay impost and weigh-mony as many times as
they shall be sold, as all other goods of like nature are used to be.

36
That the Commissioners or their goods shall not be arrested or troubled for to
have rekoning of the administration of the Company, neither for the wages due
unto any having bin employed by the Company; but pretending any such matter,
they shall be bound to call them before the ordinary Judges.

37
Any ships coming home, the Generals or Commanders of the fleet, ship or
ships, shall be bound to come unto us within ten days after their arrival,
and make report unto us of the success of their voyage, as well by writing as
by word of mouth, as we shall find convenient.

38
And if it happens (which is not to be thought) that any should cross the
navigations, traffic or trading of the Company, against the universal laws,
contracts, agreements and entercourses, it shall be lawful for the Company to
defend her self, and take their course according to the instructions given by
us.

39
Furthermore we have promised and promise by these, that we will maintain and
defend the Company in her free navigations and traffike, and assist the same to
the said purpose, with the sum of ten hundred thousand gilders to be paid
within the space of five years, and the first two hundred thousand gilders
shall be furnished as soon as the participants have brought in their first
payment of their stock promised: provided always that for the first ten
hundred thousand gilders we shall receive profit and damage as the other
participants shall do.

40
And in case it do happen the Company shall be strongly assaulted and invaded
in any of the aforesaid parts, we shall assist her (these countries in any
manner of ways being able to do it) with sixteen ships of war, the least
being three hundred tun, besides four pinnaces, the least shall be four
score tun, being of every thing necessary well furnished of ordenance both of
brass and iron, and fit quantity of munition, double hangings, sails, ropes,
ankers, and other necessaries, as shall be fit for any great voyage; provided
that the said afterward shall be manned, victualled and kept at the charge of
the Company, upon condition the said Company shall set forth likewise sixteen
ships and four pinnaces furnished as ours, for to defend the Company from her
enemies, as likewise to assault them. And our said ships of war shall join
with the ships of the Company, and shall go forth under one Admiral, to be
chosen by us with advice of the foresaid Courts or general meetings, and shall
follow our directions and commandments, agreeable to the resolutions of the
Company, to make wars against their enemies. But the ships of the Company
being laden, shall not hazard themselves without great necessity.

41
And if it shall happen that the charges of the wars in our countries here do
grow less, and increase in the parts aforesaid, we have promised and promise
by these presents to give as much aid and assistance unto the Company as
these countries shall be able to permit, and the state or condition of the
Company shall require.

42
Moreover we have ordered, that if it happen in time of wars any prises to be
taken within the said limits of the Company, as well from their enemies as
pirates, or by any ading and assisting this Company, as likewise the goods
that shall be seized upon by virtue of our Proclamations, all necessary
charges, and the damages of the Company suffered by the taking of prises,
besides the right of his Excellency in quality of Admiral, according to our
resolution made the first of April, Anno 1602, and the tenth part belonging to
the Officers, mariners and soldiers that have made the prises, being deducted,
they shall remain at the disposition of the Company, which shall be bound to
keep reckonings asunder of the same. And the profit or benefit of the said
prises, shall be employed or bestowed to the setting forth of ships, and paying
of the men of war, as likewise to the making of fortifications, the putting
in garrisons, and other like matters of war and defense both by water and
land, without making any distributions, unless it did appear the said profit
and benefit to be so great, that without weakening the defense of the Company,
and all charges of the wars being deducted, a good portion might be divided,
separated from the commerce. And the distribution shall be made in this manner:
a tenth part shall be given for the general good of these countries, and the
rest shall be divided amongst the Participants of the Company pro rato and
according to their stock.

43
Provided always that the goods and prises by virtue of our Proclamations
seized upon and brought in, shall be censured by the Judges of the Admiraltie
where they are landed, and judged whether they be lawful prises or not: And
during the suite the administration of the said goods, after a due Inventory
made, shall remain unto the Company, reserving the residue for those that by
the sentence of the Admiraltie might find themselves aggrieued. And the
Vendumaister or outcrier, and the other officers of the Admiraltie, shall not
pretend any thing of the prises benefited or sold by the Company, they having
had nothing to do with the same.

44
The Commissioners of this Company shall be bound by oath, to be true and
faithful in their administration, to keep good reckonings of their dealings,
to procure the most benefit of the Company, and to avoid all h^^^ and damage
as much as shall be in their power; that they shall not favor any of the
greatest Participants more then the least, either in the bringing in of their
stocks, or the making of the distributions: that of those that shall owe money
to the Company, they shall not favor the one more then the other: that they
as long as they shall be Commissioners, shall keep such stock in the Company
as is prefixed by this grant; as likewise that they shall keep and observe
every point and article here above mentioned, and procure to be held and kept
according to their ability.

45
All which privileges, liberties and exemptions, besides the assistance before
mentioned in every point and article here above, we have granted unto the said
Company after good advice, and do grant by these, promise and give by these
promising to procure that they shall enjoy the same without any disquietnesse
or hinderance. We order likewise that the said shall be kept by all
Magistrates. Officers and subjects of these united Provinces, without doing any
thing contrary unto the same, either directly or indirectly, within or without
these united Provinces, upon pains to be punished both in body and goods, as
enemies of the common good and infringers of our orders. Promising besides to
maintain the Company in all points aforesaid, by all treaties of peace,
alliances, entercourses, with the neighbor Princes, kingdoms and countries,
not suffering any thing to be done contrary to the same. Wherefore we charge
and command directly all Governors. Justices, Officers, Magistrates and
inhabitants of these united Provinces, that they permit and suffer the said
Company and Commissioners to enjoy peaceably and without any disturbance the
effect of this grant, consent and privilege, ceasing by this all other matters
ordered to the contrary. And because none might pretend ignorance of these, we
have commanded that the principal points of this Grant shall be made known
either by publication or affixing of bills, where it shall be required, judging
the same to be for the good of this Country.

FINIS.
