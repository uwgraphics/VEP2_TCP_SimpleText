THE TREE OF GOOD AND EVIL: OR A Profitable and Familiar Exposition of the
Commandments, directing us in the whole course of our life, according to the
Rule of Gods Word, whereby we must be judged at the last day.

By THOMSS GRANGER Preacher of Gods Word.

DEVT. 30. 19. I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life
that both thou and thy seed may live. LONDON, Printed by N. O. for SAMVEL MAN,

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR JOHN LEVENTHORP, KNIGHT, and to the most wise and
virtuous Lady IOANE his wife, Grace and Peace from God the Father, and our Lord
Jesus Christ, be multiplied.
MANY causes there were ( Right Worshipful) that moved me to pen this
Exposition on the Commandments, but especially these following.

The first cause was, the hindering at least of Satan's busy working, even in
our reformed Church, who as in the times of darkness he murdered multitudes
of souls through Idolatrous Devotions, and the false imagination of
meritorious works: even so does he now in the clear light of the Gospel,
slay a great number through a liuelesse faith, and outward empty profession:
Yet in both times has there been a certain number, whose works were
faithful, and whose faith is fruitful: Therefore to the end that they who
through self-love, and ignorance of Gods laws seem to be somewhat, may see
what sins they daily commit, and what virtues they continually omit, that
they (I say) who seem to themselves beautiful and rich enough, may see
themselves to be but wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked, Reu. 3. 17.
For their benefit and good, I first attempted this short Treatise.

A second reason was, because I saw very many, yet so ignorant, as that they
think they can keep the whole Law, grossly, and Pharisaically, examining
themselves by the outward letter of the ten Words, or Commandments, even
which notwithstanding they make small conscience continually to break, because
God is merciful: so that with them, as with carnal Gospellers, the
commandments are quite grown out of request.

A third reason like to this was, because that many even on their deathbeds,
do comfort themselves only in their own righteousness, which stands in
this, that they have always paid every man his own; That they never hurt
their neighbor by word or deed; That they have ever carried a good meaning
whatsoever they said, or did; That they have given alms to the poor,
whereupon some, being exhorted by their Minister to repent, and to call upon
God for mercy in Jesus Christ, have answered, that they knew no sin they had.
Others again, being more then wontedly sick, have marvelled that God should so
undeservedly punish them.

A fourth reason was, because that many not willing to buy a larger Exposition,
partly for the cost, partly for the length thereof (as they think, who are
cumbred with Martha about many things) might be induced, and allured to buy,
and read this short Exposition, both for the little price, for the
plainness, and for the many proofs, and brevity thereof.

A fifth reason was, that children and young folks, having learned by heart the
Principles of Christian Religion, might be instructed further in the Law, which
is the end of virtuous and godly life, both that they may understand Sermons
the better, when they hear that whereof they have already a fundamental
knowledge (which must needs stir up in them, a desire to hear and know
further therein, whereof comes dilligent attention) and also, that knowing
when they do well, and when they do ill, not only in deed, but in word and
thought, they may be brought to make conscience of every sin, which the
ignorant cannot do; that their minds and consciences being possessed with the
laws of God in every particular, in their young age, the head of sin may be
suppressed, and kept under; that they may truly repent of their sins, which
they that know not sin, cannot do; and that they may know to what
commandment every virtue and sin is referred.

And lastly, the reasons why I was bold to offer so small a present to your
Worship, of whom I have received so many kindnesses, and am indeed for sundry
respects for ever obliged unto you, are. First because I have always known
you to be a sincere lover of learning, simply for it self without by-respects,
which plainly appears in this; that you have not only been always a
special fauorer and Patron of the learned, but also separating your self from
the world, as much as your place and calling will permit, have ever devoted
your self to all good learning. Moreover the inward and sincere love and
affection in the Lord, that I have always heretofore, at this present, and
ever shall bear unto you, and your good Lady, for these excellent and most
amiable virtues, wisdom, truth, uprightness, kindness, compassion
tender-heartednesse, have enforced me to show forth my hid and smothered love,
wherein I am able, and wherein it could find passage: Therefore I desire your
Worships both in one, whom conjugal and Christian love, and unanimity, have
made one, to accept this little gift, which I am bold to cast into the treasury
of Gods Church, under your Worships protection.

The Lord continue still his favorable kindness, goodness, and mercy toward
you, in pouring down still his manifold blessings upon your ancient and
honored Family, from generation to generation for ever:

Botterwike in Holland near Bosten in Lincoln. 1616. Your Worships In all
duties to command. THOMAS GRANGER.

To the Reader.
COurteous Reader, the Lord forbad our first Parents to eat of the Tree of
Knowledge of good and evil with denunciation of an everlasting curse upon
their disobedience. Again, the same Lord commands us to eat of the Tree of
good, and evil, as a preparatiue to an everlasting and perfect remedy: For as
the eating thereof was the beginning of all evil, so the eating thereof is the
beginning of all good. For as the desire of the knowledge of good and evil
brought ignorance, and death, even so the knowledge of good and evil makes
wise unto life. But herein we show out of what root we are grown, and out
of what rock we are hewne, namely, to be always against the Lord. For as our
first parents being forbidden to eat of that one Tree, did first of all eat
of that Tree; so we being commanded to eat of this one Tree of the Garden
with promise of blessing, had rather eat of any other Tree of the Forest,
though the fruits thereof be present death: which observation of our froward
hearts caused the Heathen Poet to say, Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque
negata. Englished thus: To things forbidden we chiefly do aspire.
And things denied we most of all desire.


Now seeing that the only good and wise God has turned this curse into a
blessing that both the knowledge of our sin and misery, and also of perfect
holiness and righteousness should come by the Law, that so working guilt of
sin, fear of judgment, and utter despair of life in the conscience, we
might be enforced to fly to Christ for succor and relief in this distressed
estate, and that being in Christ, the sting of death which is sin, and the
strength of sin which is the rigor of the Law is abolished, and is become
the rule of Christian life, and a Tree of life to them that eat thereof;
seeing I say, it is thus, let us desire to eat of this Tree, for the fruits
thereof are not grievous; yea, they are pleasant, delightful, and more sweet
then honey and the honey comb, to the sanctified taste, reviving, and quickening
the soul to eternal life.

For these causes did the Lord so strictly charge the Israelites to exercise
themselves in his Laws continually: And that they might have them in perfect
remembrance above all things, he commands them to rehearse them continually
to their children, to write them upon the posts of their houses, and upon their
gates, Deuteronomy. 11. 18. 19. and to wear fringes covered with a riband of blew
silk on the borders of their garments for the same end, Numb. 18. ^9. that in
all things, in all places, and at all times, they might, as an holy and
peculiar people do the will of God, and not their own lusts as the Gentiles
do, Deuteronomy. 26. 17. 18. 19.

Now although these, and such like ceremonies be abolished, yet the Law is
everlasting, and gives no more liberty of sinning to us, then unto them; yea
having received greater measure of the Spirit of Adoption, we should more
joyfully and cheerfully perform all obedience, then they that had but the
spirit of bondage, viz. who like children were held in awe with temporal
threatenings, and sharper outward punishments: Let us therefore which have
received the promises (which they saw a far of) freely without constraint,
ingenuously and willingly as adopted sons read, hear, talk, and meditate in
the Law continually, and in steed of Jewish fringes, ribands, and Phylacteries,
fitter for children then men of perfect age, let us carry the Law engraven in
the fleshy tables of our hearts.

And because the Law makes but shallow impression in our stony hearts, and is
therefore quickly defaced, and worn out with the rust of corruption, we have
need of daily means to cleanse, purge, and correct those furring vessels, and
so much the more because we have also corrupters and tempters without us and
about us, the world and the devil that old deceitful cauiller withdrawing and
mis-leading us in every action and thought of the mind, from the will of God to
their own lusts.

Now for thy more distinct knowledge, and more spiritual and true
understanding of the Law, for thy better direction in all matters, and for thy
furtherance in godliness and virtue in these latter evil days, wherein that
wicked one, 1. Ioh. 2. 14. so wonderfully hardneth the hearts of most men, 2.
Tim. 3. 1. I have drawn an Exposition of the Commandments, in such a form
and order, with such breuity and fullness, and with so many and manifest
proofs, as that any man, learned or unlearned, may reap great benefit
thereby.

And seeing that it is easy for the price, weighty for the matter, and light
for the carriage, either in pocket, or in thy bosom, or in thy hands: think
it I pray thee no more trouble to thee then Fringes and Phylacteries Mat. 23.
5. were to the Jews, then Crosses and Crucifixes to the Papists, who think
hereby to scarre away devils, whereas indeed the devils know where to take up
their Iunes and Lodgings by these whorish tokens and marks. Contrarily, here
thou have God speaking plainly to thee, and lovingly instructing thee, and
informing thee as a father does his son. Thou have here a powerful weapon,
even the voice of God, to scarre away devils, and to reprove the wicked in all
their unjust dealings: Whatsoever men say, judge, or do, and howsoever the
world swaggeth and reeleth, as the spirit of the air that works in the
children of disobedience hales it from iniquity to iniquity: Here thou have a
firm Foundation and immovable Rock; cleave to this Rock confidently, and
build thereupon without wavering, so shall thou abide for ever, 1. Ioh. 2. 17.
when others with their wisdoms shall come to naught, 1. Cor. 2. 6. and with
their unfruitful works of darkness shall perish everlastingly: For they
that have done good, as the Law of God informs them, shall go into life
everlasting, and they that have done evil shall go into everlasting fire.

Thine in the Lord, T. G.

To the Christian Reader Grace and Peace.
GOOD Reader, thou have here a small Treatise, penned by a learned Divine,
wherein is plainly laid down the sense and meaning of every Commandment,
both in the Negative and Affirmative part, as well of Graces commanded, as of
sins forbidden, confirmed with many pregnant proofs of Scripture, wherein
much is expressed in few words: Which Treatise I have perused, and do esteem
it very profitable, especially for the unlearned which desire knowledge, and
the rather because I know none that has opened the Commandments so fully in
this manner. I commend it to thy diligent reading, continual remembrance, and
careful practice, and thee to the Grace of God, and to his favor in Christ,

Thine in the Lord, Neuill Drant.

A Profitable and Familiar Exposition of the Commandments.
THE FIRST COMMANDMENT.

thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me, and show
mercy unto thousands in them that love me and keep my Commandments.

THe occasion of the second Commandment is our aptness to carnal worship,
whereby we falsely imagine that we can devise a right manner of worship to God.

The worship of God is either inward in mind, or outward in body, Ioh. 4. 23.
chap. 9. 38.

The form of Gods worship herein commanded has four principal branches.

3 Prayer and thanksgiving, Act. 2. 42.

4 Administration and receiving of the Sacrament, Math. 26. 26. Luke 22. 19.

Prayer has two helps, Alms Dan. 4. 24. Acts 10. 2. and Fasting, Joel 1. 14.

The whole Worship of God has two helps also; Vows, and reading of godly
books, Acts 17. 11. Genesis 28. 22. Psalm. 116. 18.

Vices, or sins forbidden.
I. To make Images of God the Father, Son, or Holy Ghost; either painted, which
are called Pictures, or engraven and molten, which are called Idols.

II. Worshipping of the Image it self, Bell and Dragon.

III. Worshipping of God by Images, Exodus 32. 4.

IIII. Worshipping of imaginary Gods, Act. 28. 11.

V. Worshipping of creatures, in, by; or without an Image.

VI. Images of Christ, Crosses and Crucifixes, etc. which ought to be abolished
as the Brazen serpent was.

VII. All occasions to Idolatry, which are principally four.

1 To be present at Mass, and Popish service, 1. Cor. 10. 21. 1. Cor. 6. 20.

2 To favor or to give approbation to Idolatry.

2 To keep any relics or monuments of Idolatry, Ex. 23. 13. Genesis 31. 32.

4 To have fellowship with Idolaters, which is four ways.

1 By marriage with Idolaters, Ez^. 9. 14. 2. King. 8. 18.

2 To join in league with them, 2. Chro. 19. 2.

3 To sell them wares to Idolatrous uses.

4 To give or sell Popish b^okes to the ignorant or wavering minded.

VIII. Will Worship, Col. 2. 23.

with witches.

Witchcraft has five parts.
1 South-saying, Deuteronomy. 18. 10. Eze. 21. 21.

2 Necromancy, or coniuring, Deuteronomy. 18. 11. 2. Sam. 28. 7.

3 Sorcerie, Reu. 21. 8.

4 Iugling, Exodus 7. 11.

5 Charming, or enchantment, Deuteronomy. 18. 11. Exodus 7. 11.

X. Neglect of Preaching, Esaias 56. 10. 11. 1. Cor. 9. 16.

XI. Preaching of false doctrine, or true doctrine to a false end, 2. Ioh. 10.
1. Cor. 11. 19

XII. Unprofitable Preaching, which is by seeking vainglory and flattering.
1. Cor. 1. 18. 1. Cor. 2. 1. Lam. 2. 14.

XIII. Contempt, or refusing to hear the Word, Ier. 11. 10. Ier. 11. 8. 1.
Ioh. 4. 6.

XIIII. Unprofitable hearing, which comes,

1 For lack of preparation, Eccles. 4. 17.

2 Through unbelief, Heb. 4. 2.

3 Through coldness of affection, and an earthly heart, which may be called
dead-heartednesse, Reu. 3. 15. 16. and ver. 1.

4 Through forgetfulness, Iam. 1. 22, etc.

XV. Not to pray at all, or seldom, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17.

XVI. Unthankfulness, Esaias 1. 2. 3. Psalm. 78. 43.

The third Commandment.
Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain* For the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

THe occasion of this commandment, is our aptness and readiness to despise
God.

Vices, or sins forbidden.
I. To give occasion to the wicked to slander the Gospel, Romans 2. 24. 1. Sam.
2. 17.

II. Vain and curious talking of the Scripture, Tit. 3. 9. Col. 2. 8:

1 To think or speak of the Scripture in mocking, ieasting, or scoffing
manner, 2. Pet. 3. 4. 5. Esaias 5. 19.

2 To make ieasts out of the Scripture, Esaias 66. 2.

Ezech. 12. 27. Amos 6. 3.

22.

XVII. Perjury, Leuit. 19. 12. Mal. 3. 5.

XVIII. Vain and wicked Lots casting. Prou. 16. 33. Acts 1. 26.

XIX. Mocking, ieasting, and speaking irreverently of the works of God.

XX. Superstition.

Virtues commanded.
First, Reproof, correction, and punishment of the former sins and sinners,
according to our power, place, and calling, 1. Sam. 2, 23, etc. Tit. 1. 3.
Leuit. 19. 17. Math. 18. 16.

Secondly, a lawful and religious oath, Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Exodus 22. 11. Heb. 6. 16.

Thirdly, private instruction of Families, Deuteronomy. 6. 6. Josh. 24. 15.

Fourthly, to take, and seek occasion in time, and place convenient, to commend
Gods Greatness, Excellency, Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Justice, Mercy,
manifested in his Word and Works.

Fifthly, to use the names of God only in weighty affairs, and with all
reverence, Deuteronomy. 28. 58.

Sirthly, Zeal of Gods glory above all things in the world, Numb. 25. 8. Psalm.
69. 22. Acts 7. 51. 52. Acts 13. 10. Reu. 3. 19. Tit. 2. 14. Gal. 4. 18.

Five signs of true Zeal.
1 It begins at our selves.

2 It is suspicious of our own secret evils.

3 It is constant, not hot by fits.

4 It causes us to rejoice in the prosperity of the Church, though our selves
be in affliction.

5 It is earnest in matters of godliness, but cold in worldly things.

Seventhly, Sanctification of Gods gifts and ordinances; they are sanctified by
two means.

1 By the Word, that teaches the holy and right use of them, Psalm. 119. 24.

2 By prayer, whereby we obtain the assistance of Gods grace to use them
rightly: and whereby we magnify and bless God for giving them to us, and
giving us grace to glorify him in them.

The fourth Commandment.
Remember that thou keep holy the Saboth day: Six days thou shall labor,
and do all that thou have to do; But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God; In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy
daughter, thy man-seruant, and thy maid-seruant, thy cattle, and the stranger
that is within thy gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the
sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; Wherefore the Lord
blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.

THe occasion of this Commandment, is our readiness to fall away from God,
unless daily means be used.

Virtues commanded.
First, Preparation of ye body ye day before, by moderate labor, and diet, and
early rising on the Saboaths morning, Exodus 32. 6. Ex. 19. 14. 15.

Secondly, preparation of mind, by freeing it from worldly thoughts and cares.

Thirdly, preparation of the heart, by purging out corrupt lusts and evil
affections, Esaias. 1. 13.

Fourthly, the rest of man, and beast, the whole day from all labor not
necessary, nor holy, Exodus 34. 21.

Fifthly, Sanctification of the Saboath, that is, the separating of it to Gods
worship only, as the second commandment requires, Esaias 58. 13.

Sixthly, visiting of the sick.

Seventhly, relieuing of the poor, 1. Cor. 16. 1. 2. Neh. 8. 12.

Eighthly, instruction of our Families, Deuteronomy. 11. 19.

Ninthly, reconciliation of them that are at variance, and admonition of them
that offend.

Vices forbidden.
First, to do any work at any time, without present and evident necessity,
Ex. 34. 21. Math 12. 11. Numb. 15. 25.

Secondly, needless iournies, Ex. 16. 29.

Thirdly, Bargaining, Faires, and Markets. Neh. 13. 15, etc.

Fourthly, all vain ieasting, sporting, gaming, dancing, banqueting, Esaias 58.
13.

Fifthly, outward worship without inward affection, Esaias 1. 14. 15. 2 T. im. 3.
5. Amos 5. 21, etc.

Sixthly, giving liberty to servants and children, to spend the Saboath in
idleness and gaming.

Seventhly, neglect of bringing our whole Family to the Church, as necessity
shall permit.

The fifth Commandment.
Honor thy Father and Mother, that thy days may be long in the land which
the Lord thy God gives thee.

THe occasion of the fifth commandment is our proud and envious nature that
cannot abide to be under government, or give men their due.

By Father and Mother, is meant our natural Parents, Kings; Magistrates, and

the Law had said, thou shall not lust. Exodus 20. 17.

9 I was once alive without the Law, but when the Commandment came sin
revived.

14 For the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal sold under sin.

24 O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

PSALM. 119. 9. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? even by ruling
himself after thy Word.
A Prayer for any private Person.
MOST mighty God, and in Jesus Christ my most loving Father, and merciful
Savior, I being one of the meanest of thy servants, and unworthy of the least
of all thy mercies, do acknowledge and confess thy great goodness and bounty
toward me, in that thou have from my birth till this present, powerfully
preserved me, graciously sustained me, and mercifully provided all things
needful for my soul and body, as well as for thy dearest children. Thou
might have made me a serpent, hateful and loathsome to all thy creatures.
Thou might have utterly taken from me the spirit of wisdom, understanding,
and knowledge, and given me up into a reprobate mind, and into a foolish and
corrupt judgment, to hate the truth and to believe lies. Thou might have
taken from me health, strength, and soundness of body, and continually have
tormented me with pains, sickenesses, and diseases, and have fastened all the
sharp arrows of thy wrathful indignation in my head, heart, liver, lungs,
and other members of my body: Thou might have deprived me of all the means
of necessary maintenance, and made me a common reproach and byword to the
most abject and basest people; Yea, thou might withdraw thy presence from
me, and cause the fretting worm of fear, and despair, to gnaw on my heart
day and night, giving me my portion here with the wicked, and after death
with the damned in hell for evermore. But (loving Fathert) ^y mercy has been
endless toward me a wretched sinner, thou have not with-drawne thy loving
kindness from me, but always comforted, and refreshed me both in soul and
body, with all things needful; thou have rejoiced my heart with the riches of
thy grace; thou have measurably corrected me, lovingly instructed me, and
plentifully offered the means of salvation unto me. And now, most gracious
God, least I forget those fearful judgments oft-time^ inflicted on thy
dearest children, and despise these heavenly graces, and tender mercies,
through the deceitfulness of sin, satan, and this evil world, thou that
openest mine eyes from bodily sleep of the night, open I beseech thee also the
eyes of my mind, enlighten me with the saving knowledge of thee, thy blessed
will and holy ways, that I sleep not in death, lighten the heaviness of my
wordly heart, waken the drowsinesse of my dull and dead spirit, reform and set
in order my sensual and earthly affections, take from me this hardness of
heart, rebellion of will, foolish thoughts, vain imaginations, self-love,
pride, frowardness; take from me the way of lying, dissembling,
double-dealing, treachery, flattery, worldly craftiness, and all unlawful
getting.

Convert, o Lord, and strengthen my unbelieving, fearful, and distrustful
heart, that trusting in thee the living God, and relying wholly on thy gracious
providence in the lawful use of such means as thou daily offerest to me, I
may escape the snares of the devil, and avoid a sea of evils, whereinto the
men of this world do plunge themselves to eternal perdition. O Lord incline
my heart to thy Word, and not to covetousness, cause me to value the worth
thereof above gold and silver, and to humble my self to my Spiritual Pastors
and Teachers, whom thou have sent to call me out of the darkness of this
world into thy marvelous light. Give me power and strength to redress my
ways according to thy Word, and let not those common sins of presumption,
and carnal security get the dominion over me: Enable me in some good measure
to discern the spirits of men, and the vain fashion of this transitory world,
that I turn not aside with the multitude to do evil, but that I may delight
in the Saints here on earth, and such as excel in virtue.

And whereas Satan and his instruments are enemies to Christian love and
fellowship, give me wisdom, strength, and constancy, that I neither give
offense unto them, whereby they should withdraw themselves from my company,
neither yet take offense at their infirmities and imperfections, that I should
withdraw my affections from them, to sort my self with such as know not thee,
fear not thee, and condemn the generation of thy children. Give me grace to
walk warily in these latter evil days; preserve my going out and coming in
this day and evermore, and send thy good Angel to guide and protect me in all
my ways. And as, o Lord, I grow elder in years, and every day draw nearer to
my grave; so grant that I may grow in knowledge, faith, hope, love and all
virtue, that when it shall please thee to call me to give up an account of my
Stewardship, I may enter into thine everlasting joy. Vouchsafe, o Lord, to
bestow and increase these graces in me, for thy dearly beloved Sons sake,
Christ Jesus my Savior, in whom only thou art well pleased, to whom with
Thee, and the holy Spirit, be given all honor, glory, praise, and
thanksgiving, now and for ever.

Thanksgiving before Meat.
We thank thee, O heavenly Father, for all thy mercies, and blessings
heretofore bestowed upon us, and still continued and renewed unto us, and
especially at this time for these thy good creatures, that of thine own
goodness and bounty thou have ordained and provided for the maintenance of our
bodies, give them virtue and power to nourish us, that thereby our strengths
being renewed, we may be made the more fit and able to serve thee in the
duties of our Callings, to thy honor and glory, and to the comfort of our
own souls and consciences, through Jesus Christ our Lord: Amen.

Thanksgiving after Meat.
THe God of all glory, and power, who has created, redeemed, and presently ^ed
us, he blessed and praised, now and for evermore, Amen.

God preserve his Church, our King, his Realms and Dominions, increase in us a
true and lively faith, continual peace of conscience, and the comfortable joy
of the Holy Ghost, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
