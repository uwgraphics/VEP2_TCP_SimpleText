Speculum Aegrotorum. THE SICKEmens Glass: OR, A plain Jntroduction whereby
one may give a true, and infallible judgment, of the life or death of a sick
body, the original cause of the grief, how he is tormented and afflicted,
what things are medicinable to the diseased person: and the day and hour in
which he shall recover, or surrender his vital breath.

Whereunto is annexed a treatise of the four humors, and how they are
ingendered and distributed in our humane bodies: with certain and manifest
signs to discern of what complexion any man is: and the operation that
eating, drinking rest and exercise, works in every person: with certain
special preservatives for the eyesight.

Composed by John Fage, Student in Physic, and practitioner in Astrology.

LONDON Printed for William Lugger, and are to be sold at his Shop upon
Holborne-bridge. 1606.

To the worthy and renowned Company of Students and professors of the excellent
science of Physic, John Fage wishes health.
IVdicious Doctors and professors of the famous and laudable science of
Physic (in token of the inestimable love and good will I bear to this worthy
faculty) I have unto you (as the chief patrons thereof,) committed this little
Glass of sick men: wherein you may behold the state and condition of the
diseased person (so truly and infallibly, as the Art of Astrology can
certify) being as well correspondent and agreeable to the sayings of ancient
and approved Authors, as by experience and daily observations verified,
whereof I my self have made sufficient trial (as many of my familiar friends
and associates can testify) insomuch that he which compares these documents
with the judicials of urine, shall thereby not only decerne and perceive the
true cause of the disease, but also the augmentation, relaxation, continuance
and alteration thereof to good or evil (both to the praise and estimation of
the art, and also the credit and profit of the expert Physician) assuring you
that herein is nothing written, but only that which has been taken out of
the grounds of Astrology, and agreeable to the sentences of the most
excellentest Physicians. And although peradventure this method and manner of
judgment does seem hard and difficile to some men at the first aparance, yet
let no man be discouraged, for with a little reading and perusing, it will soon
appear both plain and easy, which being once obtained, the commodity thereof
will be very delectable and profitable. And so to conclude, if this my labor
be acceptable to your learned ears, it will encourage me (to endeavor to the
vtermost of my power) both to examplefie this introduction, and also to supply
you with another treatise which shall fully and largely detect and lay open
this manner of Judicials: so in the mean time I commit you (and your
industrious actions) to the protection of the Almighty. At Midhurst this 24.
of April. 1606. *

To the Reader.
Leaving thee diverse and sundry opinions of many Authors (with their mistaken
axioms and vnaprooued sayings) as well as the rash boldness and presumptuous
judgments of those ignorant persons which either by the day of the month, the
age of the Moon, or Plannet, then raygning, only do give judgment on the
life or death of a sick person, or of the manner of his disease: which by
their erroneous opinions have brought this famous art into such and so great
contempt, that of the most part of men, it is supposed to be rather a
recreatiue invention, then any true and unfeigned asscertion. I have (Gentle
Reader) by the help of those two excellent Astonomers, Ptholomeus and Hermes,
nourished and brought up this prole or issue, which although it be yet young,
naked, weak, and tender, yet I hope in consequence of time (when it is come to
ripeness of age, well clothed and to his full strength) that it will be able
to stop the mouth of this hidious monster ignorance, which with his violent
sting and venomous biting, seeks utterly to destroy science and learning,
according to the old proverb scientia non habet inimicum nisi ignoranciam: So
committing this little one into thy favorable protection, I hope thou will
rather charitably, foster it in the lap of pity: then tyranically and
cruelly to destroy it in his infancy.

Yours to the uttermost of his power. John Fage

Of the significator of the sick body.
IT has been an order and a custom (amongst the most excellentest and wisest
Physicians) to choose the Moon for the principal significatrix of the sick
person, and according unto her motion, situation, and configuration (with
other Plannets) have given judgment on the increasing, mittigation, and
alteration of the disease.

For Hippocrates (in principio Prognosticorum) speaks of the Moon, and says
in this manner. There is a certain Star of heaven on which a Physician must
take heed and mark, the purueiance thereof is wonderful and dreadful. Also
Galen (in commento de diebus criticis) says: a Physician must take heed and
advise himself of a certain thing that fails not, neither deceives, (which
the Astronomers of Aegipt taught) that is to say, when the body of the Moon is
joined with fortunate stars, dreadful and fearful sickness comes to good
end. Likewise Astronomers say, that among all the other plannets the Moon (in
ruling) has most power and maistry of men's bodies: for as Ptolomeus says (in
Libro de iudicijs Astrorum) under the Moon is contained, sickness, loss, fear,
harm, and damage: therefore about the alteration of man's body, the Moon
works most principally: and not with out good cause, for as Astronomers
affirm, she has dominion and goernment of all liquid and moist substances, as
the water, oil, and sap of trees, etc, As the thrice learned Clark Doctor
Dee, in the 103. Apkorisme of his Book entitled Libro de quibusda^ naturae
virtutibus says thus Luna potentissima est humidarum rerum moderatrix,
humidatisque excicatrix and effectrix. So we may no less assure our selves
that she has superiority and predomination on the fours humors, Choler, Blood,
Fleame and Melancholy, which in substance are naught else but humedious and
vaporatiue, although they differ in quality Then as Physicians do hold the
opinion that all the infirmities which naturally happen to any person (and not
by any mischance orsodaine accident) does proceed and come by the
distemperance of those four Humors; so we may very well conclude, that if the
superficies or head of a Fountain, does alter his accustomarie course of
running, then the adiacienticall or belonging streams must needs differ either
in quality or in quantity. So likewise the Moon being pasiua qualitatis
collecteth and retains the good or evil influence of that plannet to whom
she is adjoined or applies: as Hermes says (in his Iatromethematikes) Luna
vero stellae (sine benifica sieve malifica fuerit) vtri se applicuerit, illi
suffragabiter. And because her orb is nearest unto the earth, sends us the
virtue and impression of the other Plannets: and so causes the mutabillitie
and alteration of men's bodies, to good or evil, according to the nature of
that Plannet with whom she is adjoined or configurated, and the part of the
Zodiake wherein she is situated: For the expert Physician must observe and
mark how she passes through the 12. signs, and thereof shall understand much
of the alteration of the disease, by a certain difference and distance of part
of the Zodiake from the degree the Moon was in, at the instant when the sick
person was first bedride, or took his bed, and when the Moon comes
thereunto, that day they shall call critticall, judicial or mortal according
to the space or distance it differs from the degree of the Zodiake that the
Moon possessed when the party took his bed: which some men (deceiving
themselves) have reckoned and numbered always by a certain difference of
days, from the time the party fell sick, calling the second and fifth, mortal
days, the fourth a judicial or showing day, and the 7. and 14. critticall
days, or such like: which is an open and manifest error, for seeing the Moon
(having an unequal motion) comes sometimes to the before said parts of the
Zodiake a day sooner and othertimes a day later: it is impossible (for he that
accounts by an even number of days) to find out the true Critticall,
Mortal, or Judicial days* therefore for the better avoiding of this apparent
error, I have heers^ (...) annexeda very necessary Table, plainly expressing
those aforesaid times, as follows.

The use of this Table.
FOr every sign and degree the Moon is in, there is 16. columbes in the
table (caractered with their proper figures of Algorisme, with these letters S.
and D. signifying signs and degrees) in which the mortal, judicial and
critical days, does happen in: being noted at the head of the Table thus:
Mort: Days, Iudic: days and Critic: days. The use of this Table is thus: The
day and hour known in which the sick person took his Bed, you must search
the sign and the degree the Moon is in (which being found) entering into the
Table (in the vttermoste columbe on the left hand) entitled the party falling
sick, (under the carracter of Luna) you shall find against the sign and
degree the Moon is in, all the Critical, Judicial, and Mortal days in their
proper Columbes (noted at the head of the Table) during the space of time, the
Moon passes through the whole Zodiac or signifier, to which aforesaid
places, when she comes (during the continuance of ye sickness) then shall be
the true Critical, Judicial and Mortal days, as you shall see them
superscribed at the head of the Columbe.

An example.
The first day of May 1605. Acertaine man sickned and took his bed, at 6. of
the clock in the afternoon, the Moon being then in the 12. degr. of Pisces,
now I desire to know the Critical, Judicial and Mortal days (of that person)
then entering into the Table in the uttermost columbe on the left hand, under
the caracter of the moon in Pisces, over against the 12. degrees. in the
nextcolumbe, I find the 7. degree of Aries, to which when the Moon comes is
a mortal day: and in the third columbe, I find the 27. degree of Aries, to
which part of the Zodiac when the Moon comes, is a Judicial day In the
fourth columbe, I find the 22. degree of Taurus, which is a mortal time, and
in the fifth columbe, I find the 12. of Gemini, to which place when the Moon
comes, that is a Critical day, and so of the rest until the Moon has
perambulated through the whole Zodiac, and if the diseases cease not in ye
mean while, after you have gone through the 16. Columbes, you must begin
again as you did before: Note that the time the person takes his bed, is the
first critical time.

Of the Aspects of the Moon with the Planets.
IF you desire to know with what Planets the Moon is configurated or adjoined,
you must learn what day and hour the sick body first took his bed, or lay
down by means of the rage of the disease: except the sickness came to him at
that time, when he was already in his bed for then you shall observe the time
in which the disease began to torment him: which being exactly known, you must
calculate the motion of the Moon for the time the person fell sick,
considering that she is joined and applies unto a Plannet, two manner of
ways, that is to say either corporally, or by the aspect of the Semidiameters
of their bodies called applycation.

Corporal Conjunction is when the Moon is in the same sign and degree
another Planet is, but the Moon is said to be radiationally joined to a
Planet, when her body touches his Semidiameter.

Likewise the Moon is aspected and beheld of a Plannet two manner of ways.

The one is called a perfect aspect as when there is 60 degrees between the
centure of the Moon and another Plannet, that is said to be a true Sextile
aspect.

Or when the body of the Moon is distant from another Plannet 90. degrees, is
called a perfect Quartile aspect.

Or when the Moon is elonged just 120 degrees from another Plannet, the Moon
is said to behold that Plannet, with a (...) Trine aspect. And if the centure
of the moon be distant 180 (...) from ye body of another Plannet, yt is named
a perfect Opposition.

The other is an imperfect aspect called applycation, as when a Plannet is
certain degrees different from a true aspect, only (...) in the Semidiameter
of his body.

The Semidiameter or half the beams of Degrees. 9. 9 8. 15. 8. 7. 12.

So that Saturn and Jupiter extend their forces but to 9. degrees Mars unto 8.
Sol unto 15. Venus and Mercury almost unto 8. Luna unto 12. for if the body
of the Moon or her aspect comes within the Semidiameter of any Plannet, she
takes or receives the influence of that Plannet (good or evil) to whom she
is so joined or applies.

Example.
Suppose the Moon be in the fourth degree of Aquarius, and Saturn, in the 11.
degree of the said sign, then should the Moon apply to Saturn, for as much
as her body is within the Semidiameter of his beams. Or if the moon were in
the 10. degree of Taurus and Mars, in the 16. degree of Leo, then she should
behold Mars with a Quartile aspect.

But if the Moon were in the 20. degree of Capricornus and Saturn in the 8.
degree of Libra, then should the Moon be free from the Quartile of Saturn,
for because his maliciousness extends no farther then the semidiameter of
his beams (which is but 9. degr.) and their distance from a true aspect is 12.
degr. yet notwithstanding the ill fortunes does afflict the sick person, when
they adioyne or aspect the beams of the Moon, with their Semidiameter (but
not intercidentically) for the farther the Moon is from their conjunction or
aspect, the less they torment the diseased: and contrarily the fortunes
(Jupiter and Venus) the nearer their bodies or Aspect approaches to the moon,
the more they intermeddle their virtues, and the sooner mittigateth the sick
man's pains.

Note that of the Aspectes the Quartile and Opposition are haiefull and
maleuolous Aspects, especially the Opposition.

And the Sextile and Trine aspects are favorable and friendly aspects, chiefly
the Trine.

The Conjunction is variable, for it is very good with good Planets, and
extreme evil with ill.

Also sometimes it shall be necessary to know the latitude of the Planets.

To know whether the sick person shall live or die.
IF the moon (at the day and hour the sick took first his bed,) be free
from the Conjunction, Quartile, or Opposition aspect of Saturn and Mars, the
diseased person shall not depart by means of that sickness (especially if
Jupiter or Venus regard the Moon with Conjunction, Sextile, or Trine aspects)
for then the sick shall soon recover his health, and so much the rather if
the Moon be free from combustion, and augmenting in light and motion. Also the
head of the Dragon is of the nature of ye fortunes (Jupiter and Venus) but not
so effectual in operation.

But contrariwise, if the Moon be afflicted either by the Conjunction,
Quartile or Opposition of ye ill fortunes (Saturn and Mars) the sick shall
die, chiefly if Jupiter or Venus do not assist the moon, or if she be combust
and decreasing in light and motion.

Also the Dragons tail is of the nature of the ill fortunes, but of himself
has not the interficient force of Saturn or Mars, for as much as it is a line
and not a Star.

Likewise if the moon be in the via combusta, which is from the midst of
Libra until the midst of Scorpio, or under the Sun beams and decreasing
in light or motion, and applying to Saturn and Mars, either by conjunction or
any aspect (chiefly by Quartile or Opposition aspect, although their
semidiameters only behold the semibeames of the moon) it threatens death.

An example.
A certain man fell sick and took his bed, the mooone being three degrees
in Scorpio (decreasing in light and motion) Mars 13. degrees in Libra, and
Saturn 27. degrees in Sagitarius, and departed when the moon came to the 13.
degres of Capricornus.

To know the times in which the sick person shall feel ease of his pain, or
recover his health.
Having found by the Doctrine aforesaid, that the sick person shall not
depart, then as often as the moon meets with^^^ body or aspect of the
fortunes, (Jupiter or Venus) during the (...) of the disease, at that instant
the sick person shall be (...) eased of his dolorous pains: the ill fortunes
the contrari^, (...) first obuiating or meeting of Luna with Jupiter or Venus
((...) a Critical, Judicial, or Mortal day) the diseased person shall beg^^
to recover his health.

An example.
Anno Dom. 1605. the 28. of May (about 7. of the (...) the forenoone) a
certain friend of mine fell sick in his Bed: the Moon being then in the 2.
degr. of Pisc^s (decreasing) Mars 18. degrees in Gemini, Saturn. 23. degrees
in Sagitarius, Jupiter 26. in Capricornus, and Venus 4. degrees in Gemini: Now
for as much as I find the Moon to be free from the interficient force of the
ill fortunes, I judge the sick shall not depart: yet he was grievously
tormented and afflicted, for because the hateful beams of Mars his Quartile
aspect, was within the semidiameter of the Moon, and none of the fortunes did
intermeddle their favorable beams. And when the Moon came to the 19. degrees. of
Pisces (meeting the Opposition of furious Mars) he had a great and mighty fit
of sickness, almost absolutely depriving sense and motion. Also he was sorely
tormented when the Moon came to the 24. degree of Pisces, because she then
beheld Saturn with a spiteful Quartile aspect, after that he began to amend,
forasmuch as that was a mortal day, and Jupiter environed the Moon with a
friendly Sextile aspect.

To know when and what time the sick Person shall depart and be grievously
tormented.
NOW if you find by the afliction of the Moon at the time the party fell
sick, that he shall dye, then on the next mortal day that the Moon meets
with either of the ill fortunes Saturn or Mars, by coniunctio^, Quartile, or
Opposition (applying to the^ either corporally or radiationally) the sick shall
dye at that day and hours in which she comes to the interficient point of the
Zodiake: which agrees to the saying of Ptholomeus in the 16. Aphorism of his
Centiloquiums wherein he says we must behold the motion of ye Moon as she
passes through the Critical, Judicial, and Mortal days, for if she be in
them fortunate, it will fall out well: unfortunate, the contrary.

An example.
The 17. day of May (Anno Dom. 1605.) A man fell sick about a (...). of the
clock at night, the Moon being then in the 2. degree of Libra, Sol in the 6.
degree of Gemini, Saturn in the 24. degrees. of Sagitarius, Jupiter in the 27.
degree of Capricornus, Mars in the 10. degree of Gemini, and Venus in the 22.
degree of Taurus: Now I (...) the Moon aflicted by the hateful Quartile
aspect of Saturn, being situated within the maleuolous beams of the
semidiameter of froward Saturn, whereby I judge that the sick shall depa^t:
then entering into the Table of Critical. Judicial and Mortal days, I find
the first mortal day to be when the Moon comes to the 27. degrees. of the said
sign of Libra, yet for as much as that degree is free from the oppression of
the ill fortunes, I affirm that the sick shall not dye at that time the Moon
comes to the said sign and degree: Therefore I seek the next dying day,
which is when the moon comes to the 12. degree of Sagitarius, which being
aflicted by the Opposition of Mars, collocated in the 14. degree of Gemini, I
judge he shall dye when the Moon comes to the 12. degree of Sagitarius: and
so he did.

Note that during the time and permanence of the sickness, as often as the
Moon meets the bodies or ill aspects of the distroyers of nature, so often
the diseased person shall feel and sustain very sore panges.

Furthermore, some Astronomers affirm, that as long as the Moon decreaseth in
motion, so long the grief shall aggrauate, and wax greater and greater.

But Hyppocrates (in Libro de Iudicijs infirmitat: secundum lunam) says thus,
when the sick person takes his bed you must consider whether the moon
departs out of combustion, for then the sickness shall increase until Luna
comes to Opposition, by reason that humors increase in men's bodies: and if
she be then with good Plannets, it falls out well: with evil, the contrary.

Of the cause of the disease.
TO know the cause of the disease, you must look with what Plannet the moon
is configurated or adjoined either by conjunction or aspect, and according to
the nature and influence of that planet, judge the disease that afflicted the
moon.

The coniuction or any aspect of the ill fortunes does afflict the Moon, and
the Quartile, and Opposition of Sol and Mercury. Now if Sa^^rne or Mercury
oppress the Moon, the disease shall be slow and slack, with lassitude and
heaviness of the limbs: insomuch that the sick shall scarce be able to
stir his body, and the disease shall show it self by little and little, by
coldness of the body, with defluction, debillitie, and obstruction: causing the
sick to awake out of his sleep suddenly or by starts. etc.

The sick person (also as Hermes says) shall be sollitarie, silent, and
fearful, desiring heat, warm clothes, and darkness, with often sighing,
and continual oscitation and yawning: the whole superficies of the body will be
cold and dry, and the pulses little and slow. The cure of such, is by things
that disolue and bind.

But if the Moon (at that time the person fell sick) be afflicted by Mars or
the Sun, all the superficies and upper parts of the body shall be in extreme
heat as if they were incensed and kindled with fire. The party shall be very
prone and apt to anger, crying-out with scritches and fearce looks, sometimes
inordinately with rauing and frantic fits: as when choler rauisheth up into
the head, perturbating the brain with violent heat etc.

Also they are very dry and thirsty, desiring cold drink, with spitting and
aridity and drines of the tongue, with loss of appetite, and desire of meat:
continually saporing and tasting with the tongue: The visage and face as red as
fire, and all the body laden with superfluity; the pulses are little, pressed
down and inordinate. Bloodletting until the fifth day, and such things as are
refrigeratiue, repercussiue, and avoid superfluity, are medicinable to the
sick person.

Likewise Hermes says, that they in whose decumbiture the moon was afflicted,
of Sol or Mars, shall feel loathsomeness in the mouth and stomach, with pain
in the heart, veins and artires. But continuall-Feauers, Plurisies,
Exulceration, and inflammation of the Lungs, take their original of Saturn and
Mercury, afflicting the Moon in fiery signs.

The fortunes (Saturn and Venus) in my opinion do never vex and torment the
sick body, although they behold the Moon with hateful aspects, or at the
least wise, never in such sort that they cause the sick to take his bed: for
seeing that they are adi^tors and restorers of nature, it is unlikely that they
should become enemies and destroyers thereof, although sometimes by accidents
(as by hateful aspect) their friendship and familiarity is refrained.

Of the effects that the Moon operateth and works in every sign when she
is afflicted by the ill fortunes.
. in. of. oppressed.
Whosoever takes his bed, the moon being in the sign of Aries (chiefly
decreasing in light and motion) and applying to Saturn or Mars (especially by
Conjunction, Quartile or Opposition) the disease shall take his original and
beginning of a cold cause, with heaviness of the head, and debillation and
weakness of the eyes, with distillation and falling down of humors into the
breast, by means of a rumeticke head, and stuffing of the throat and pipes
with fleame and catarre: The vehemence and rage of the grief shall chiefly
extend it self by night, all the intrailes and inward parts shall be exceeding
hot, but the superficies and extreme par^es shall shiner with cold, with
languishing and sounding, and loss of appetite, and sweating in the dead of
the night: the Pulses are weak and inordinate. Things that heat, mollify,
and lose the belly, do cepresse the cause of the grief, but blood letting is
unprofitable.

And if the moon apply to none of the fortunes, but is within the
Semediameter of the body of Saturn or Mars, or their ill aspectes, then on
the next mortal day, in which the moon meets with Saturn or Mars, the
sick shall depart: but if the moon be not within the beams of Saturn and
Mars, nor their malicious aspects (especially increasing in light and motion,
and applying to Jupiter or Venus) then on the next time that Luna meets with
Jupiter or Venus (upon a critical day, etc.) The sickness shall abate, or at
least wise, turn out of one disease into another. But if Mars likewise
ob^iateth the moon in manner aforesaid, then the grief shall be mortal and
invincible, for when the moon does come to his diameter, he shall die: after
the opinion of Hermes.

in of aflicted.
BUT he that lies down, the Moon being in Aries and applying to Mars or
Sol, the grief shall take his original from the head, with pricking and aching
in the pellices of the brain; those persons shall be tormented with continual
Feauers, neither can they take any rest or sleep, except sometimes a little
flumbring: Their mouth is hot with intolerable thirst, the tongue dry and
troubled with heat, with callidity and dryness of the breast, and inflammation
of the Liver, tending to a phrensy and alienation of mind. The pulses are
sublated, high and inordinate: The helping and healing of those persons, is by
letting of blood, and using of thinge^ that refrigerate and mittigate.

But if the Moon (especially decreasing in light and motion) be either
corporally or radiationally joined with Saturn or Mars, or their envious
aspects, then the sick shall die: contrarily if the moon be^ free from their
semidiameters both corporally and raditionally) chiefly augmenting in light
and motion) and applying to Jupiter or Venus, then the sick man shall recover
his health as aforesaid.

The in, of oppressed.
IF the Moon (at the increasing of the disease) runs through the celestial
sign of Taurus, be afflicted by the diameter, Aspect, Quartile or Opposition
of Saturn (chiefly slow in motion and decreasing) the sickness shall proceed of
much drinking, ebrosity or else repleation, with Feauers coming of
obstruction, and ach of the precordiackes, and artires: with inflammation of the
whole body, and exulceration of the lunges: the pulses are lofty, high and
inordinate; Blood letting and such things as open and disolue, profits.

And if the Moon be joined to Saturn or Mars, or afflicted by their ill
aspects (especially diminishing in light and motion) then when the Moon
obuiateth or meets with Saturn or Mars (on a mortal day) the sick person
shall perrish.

But if she be free from their bodies or ill aspects (chiefly augmenting in
light and motion, and applying to the fortunes) then on the next critical day
etc. That the Moon concurreth with Jupiter or Venus, the sick shall amend.

The Moon in, of afflicted.
But if the Moon be configurated to Mars either by Conjunction or aspect, the
sick shall take his bed by the means of a disease proceeding of blood, and be
vexed with continual Feauers and obstruction of the whole body with
inflammation of the neck and pole, ache of the bones, with inordinate watch,
insomniation, and desire of drink, and cool things. Blood letting and things
that extenuat, mittigate and aswage, are good against the cause of the grief.

And if the violence of Mars be not resisted by ye favorable beams of the
fortunes, but ye the moon must needs suffer his malicious influence, then on
the next meeting of her and the ill fortunes (upon a dying day) the sick shall
depart. But if the moon be delivered from the intercidentical force of Mars
(chiefly increasing in light and motion, and adiuted by the amiable beams of
Jupiter or Venus) then the disease shall slake after the next Judicial etc.
concourse with the Moon and the fortunes.

The Moon in. of oppressed.
THe Moon in Gemini afflicted by the maleuolous influence of Saturn
(especially deminishing in light and motion) shall cause the disease to take
his beginning and original, by reason of vigillation and much watch, or by
lassitude and weariness of the body with traveling or excess of labor and
violent exercise: The arti^s and sinews shall (as though they were losed)
scarce cleave together, with much debillation and weariness of the body: the
grief shall soon show it self (or as Hermes says,) after three days until
the 30. day, the disease shall increase with small Feauers, and consumption,
and wasting of the whole body: Also the disease shall be most tormentable by
night with sweating and grief of the spleen: the pulses are low and little.
Oftentimes such persons shall have a defluxion and falling down of humors into
the arms and legs.

And if the Moon apply to Saturn (either by Conjunction, Quartile, or
Opposition aspect) then on the next congresse of Luna, with the destroyers of
nature (upon an interficient day) the sick person shall give up his Ghoast.

But if the Moon b^ elonged above 9. degrees from the body or ^ll aspect of
Saturn, then the sick shall not depart, especially if the moon be increasing
in light and motion, and defended by the beams of the fortunes: yet the sick
shall be feeble a long time by means of the congellation and toughnes of the
matter dispersed through all the body.

The Moon in. of. afflicted.
WHos^ takes his bed, the moon being in Gemini, and adjoined or enimically
aspected and beheld of the furious and ^reful Plannet Mars (especially
decreasing in light and motion) that person shall be violently tormented with
a mortal and deadly disease, proceeding of much ingurgitation of wine and
strong drink, and chollericke matter. The sick person shall have continual
and pernicious burning Feauers, with obstructions and stopping of the veins.
The pulses shall be high, and inordinate.

Blood letting is convenient to the sick body. And if the Moon be
configurated to none of the fortunes, but applies also to Saturn (either by
Conjunction, or hateful aspect.) the sick person shall not escape, but at the
next mortal day that Luna comes within the dangerous confines of frowing
Saturn, the sick shall yield himself a prisoner and captive to pale death.

Contrarily if the moon be free from the semidiameters of the ill fortunes
(especially assisted with the fortunes, and augmenting in light and motion)
then on ye next meeting of the Moon with Jupiter or Venus (upon a mortal day,
etc.) the diseased body shall feel ease.

The Moon in. of. oppressed.
Saturn afflicting the moon in Cancer (at the lying down of any sick and
diseased Person) denotes the grief to come of much bathing in cold water, or
of a conceit, or vehement cold, or by late drinking, or fitting long at
studdy, or such like: The sick person shall be vexed with the Cough, Catarre
and horsenes, and distillation and falling down of humors into the breast:
with obstructions and oppilation of the Pipes, with Feauers, strict and
inordinate: the pulses are low and little.

And if the moon be decreasing in light and motion, and placically adjoined to
Saturn, the sick shall die (chiefly if none of the fortunes assist the moon
with their favorable beams.)

But if the moon be elonged from the beams of Saturn (especially increasing
in light and motion) and fortunately aspected of Jupiter or Venus, then on the
next meeting of the moon with the fortunes upon a Iudicall day etc.) nature
shall prevail against the evil humors.

The Moon in of afflicted.
HE that is debride or takes his bed, the Moon being in the sign of Cancer,
malefacted by the evil influence of Mars, shall have a disease proceeding of
blood or sweet fleame, with euersion and tourning of the ventricle. Things that
refrigerate and cool expelles the grief.

And if none of the fortunes intermeddle their friendly beams, ye diseased
party shall hardly escape, especially if the Moon be combust, or decreasing in
light and motion.

But if she be adiuted and helped by the fortunes, then at the next obuiation
of Luna with the restorers of nature Jupiter or Venus (upon any of the
alteration days) the rage and fury of Mars shall b^ emulgated and abated.

The Moon in of oppressed.
IN whose decumbiture and lying down the Moon possessed the celestial sign
of Leo (and therein afflicted of Saturn) the griese shall proceed of blood: the
sick person shall be grieved about all ye breast with heat and intension of
the heart stringes, with augmenting Feauers: The pulses are troubled and out of
course, with great heat and feruentnes both inwards and outward. Things that
heat and mittigate, are very good and commodious to the sick body.

And if Mars also oppress the Moon, or if she be not succored under the
wings of the fortunes, then (on the next mortal day, that the Moon meets
with the venomous beams of the destroyers of nature) the sick shall dye:
chiefly if the Moon be combust, or deminishing in light and motion.

But if Jupiter or Venus regard the Moon either corporally or raditionally,
especially she being free from the Sun beams, and augmenting in light and
motion, for then nature shall get the victory of the rebellous humors, and on
the next ambulation of the Moon with the fortunes (on a critical day) the
sick shall amend.

The Moon in. of. afflicted.
THE Moon being in Leo (oppressed by Mars) the grief shall proceed of
superaboundance of blood, causing unstable and uncertain Feauers, with
languishing, and sounding, and loss of appetite: heaviness of the body, with
drowsinesse and dead sleep vnerpugnable, with extenuation and consuming of the
whole body: weakness, with diverse passions and affectes of the heart. Things
that are refrigeratiue and abstringent are medicinable.

And if the M^one apply to the fortunes (chiefly free from combussion,
increasing in light, and swift in motion) the sick shall not depart: yet the
grief shall be dangerous by reason of the violent heating and adustion of the
blood.

But if the Moon be past the Opposition and joined to the evil beams of Mars
diminishing in light and motion: then (upon the next interficient day that the
Moon meets with the bodies or ill aspects of Saturn or Mars) the diseased
person will be forced to yield and surrender his spirit.

The Moon in. of. oppressed.
IF the Moon be in Virgo afflicted by the Conjunction or aspect of Saturn (at
the time the sick took his bed) the grief shall proceed of cruditie and
indigestion in the stomach, with ache of the bowels and intrailes, proceeding
of tough and viscuous fleame, sometimes with headache and pricking under the
ribs, Feauers, strict and inordinate. Things which callifie, mollify, and
dissolve, are curable to the grief.

And if the fortunes aspect the Moon (especially she being increasing in light
and motion, and free from the sun beams) then the sick person shall not
depart: yet he will be long sick, by the means of the crudde humors which will
be long before they are fully overcome.

But if none of the fortunes behold the moon, then there is no hope of life,
but at the next meeting with the moon and the ill fortunes (on a Mortal day)
nature shall be utterly endamaged and overcome.

The Moon in. of. afflicted.
THe moon in Virgo (afflicted by the malicinus beams of outrageous Mars) the
sickness shall proceed of sharp and fretting humors, with flux of the
womb, and exulceration of the bowels, with small and vustable Feauers: The
pulses are flow and thick, with euersion of the ventricle, and the stomach
abhorring and loathing of meat. Things yt repress the disease, are such as
are obstructiue, and expel sharp fretting humors.

And if the severity and cruelty of Mars be not emulgated and abated (either
by the conjunction, application, or co^figuratio^ of Jupiter or Venus) the
sick shall not escape: chiefly the Moon being combust, and decreasing in
light and motion.

But if the Moon apply to none of the fortunes he shall dye (on the next
mortal day) to the fortunes the contrary.

The Moon in of oppressed.
AT whose decumbiture the Moon was collocated in the sign of Libra (and
oppressed by the body or aspect of Saturn.) The grief shall come of the
ingurgitation or inordinate swilling of wine, and strong drink, with
nocturnall and nightly assault and conflict, pain and grief of the head and
breast, distillations, cough, and hoarsnes: The breast greened of lassitude,
the stomach disdaining meat, small Feauers coming by night with a double
access. He shall be continually tormented and afflicted, with remission and
slacknes of the pulses. Things that callifie and heat are very profitable.

And if the Moon apply to none of the fortunes neither by Conjunction nor
aspect, then the sick shall dye: especially if the Moon be combust, or
decreasing in light and motion.

But if Mars also afflict the Moon, then the grief shall not turn out of one
disease into an other, but at the next congression with Saturn or Mars (on an
intercidenticall day) the sick person shall die.

The Moon in of afflicted.
MARS oppressing the moon in the sign of Libra, will provoke a disease
proceeding of blood; whereof will grow intensed Feauers, with vigillation and
waking, and inflammation of the whole body. The reamidy in curing of such
persons, is by letting of blood, and the usage of such things as are
dormitable.

And if none of the fortunes regard the Moon (so afflicted) the diseased
person will be constrained to give place to death.

But if the malice of Mars refrayned (by the influence of Jupiter or Venus)
the sick shall not depart: but at the next congresse of the Moon with Saturn
or Mars (upon a judicial day etc.) the diseased person shall be restored to
his pristiue strength.

The Moon in of oppressed.
FVrthermore the Moon being in Scorpio of Saturn indamaged (by the evil
influence of his poisoned corpse) The disease shall happen by the means of
exulceration, or of the evil called bubo in the secret parts, viz. in anno aut
pudenda etc. And if the Moon increase in light and motion, (especially adiuted
by Jupiter or Venus) then the sickness shall be overcome.

But if none of the fortunes behold the Moon neither by Conjunction nor
Aspect (chiefly deminishing in light and motion) then on the next mortal
congression of Luna with the destroyers of nature, dryrie death shall attainte
the afflicted corpse of his silly captive.

The Moon in of afflicted.
THE Moon in Scorpio at the lying down of the sick person (oppressed by
Mars) the disease shall proceed of some fervent or hot impostumation or
exulceration, the Pockes, Measels, and Hemerods, Pestilence, Illiacie, and such
like.

And if the Moon apply to no fortunate plannet, (but is corporally or
raditionally adjoined to an ill plannet) then on the next meeting of Luna with
the destroyers of nature (on a mortal day) the grieved person shall depart.

But if the moon be swift in motion and departing out of combustion
(fortunatly affected of Jupiter or Venus) the party shall be delivered at the
next mortal congression of the Moon and the fortunes.

The Moon in of afflicted.
Saturn afflicting the Moon in Sagitarius (especially slow in motion and
decreasing) will torment the sick body with defluction, of thin and sharp
biting humors, ach of the sinews and artiers, refrigerations, with extreme
horror of a Fever, corripienting, and afflicting the sick with double
access. The remedy of those is by things that mittigate, aswage and heat.

And if none of ye fortunes behold ye moon with their amiable beams, but is
adjoined or applies to Saturn or Mars, (either by Co^junction or asp^cte)
then the sick shall not escape: but at the next mortal configuration of the
Moon with the ill fortunes, the sick shall depart.

But bring adiuted of y^ fortun's (especially increasing in light and motion)
and free from combustion the sick shall recover after the next applycation of
Luna and the fortunes on a critical day, etc.

The Moon in. of. oppressed.
Mortal and deadly diseases are bred and ingendered in their bodies, (at whose
decumbiture the moon was oppressed by the influence of furious Mars,) taking
original and beginning, of much dri^king and repleation: as unstable Feauers,
coming of Chollericke matter, solution and loosenes of the womb: The pulses
are remiss and languidious, and the healing of such must be by things that
are refrigeratiue and obstructiue:

It the moon apply to Saturn either by Conjunction, Quartile, or Opposition,
then the grief shall be incurable.

But if the Moon be elonged 10. degrees, or more from the hateful beams of
Saturn and Mars, or applying to Jupiter or Venus (especially aumenting in
light and motion) the sick shall be diseased until the next Critical etc.
obuiation of the moon and the fortunes, and then he shall be delivered.

The Moon in. of. oppressed.
THe moon in Capricornus (afflicted of Saturn and diminishing inlight and
motion) the grief shall come of a cold cause, with thin and subtle
distillations heaviness of the breast, and the lunges oppressed with difficulty
of breathing, the cough shall greeuouflye torment him by night, with intensed
Feauers: Things that mittig^te and heat, are medicinable.

And if the Moon be not succored by the congression, Conjunction or aspect of
the fortunes, the ficknesse shall be long, yet notwithstanding mortal.

But if the moon be separated from the semidiameter of his body, or evil
aspect (especially augmenting in light and motion) the^ on the next
confamiliaritie of the moon (with Iupi^er or Venus) nature shall prevail
against the crudde humors.

The Moon in. of. afflicted.
BUt it Mars afflict the moon in the sign of Capricorn it w^l provoke an
infirmity of vomitting, preceding of cho^^oricke matter or evil digestion.
This disease is dangerous and full of per^ill: continual Feauers, and
unstable, loss of appetite, floxe of the womb, with exulceration and
exasperation of the fingers, by means of sharp choler and inflammation of the
breast: and it is painful for the sick person to stretch or stir his
sinnowes.

The pulses are remiss and slack. Things constringentiue, and obstructiue,
are medi^pnable.

And if the Moon be within the semidiameter of Mars, or meets also the
beams of Saturn (at that instant) then the party shall not escape, but at
the next obuiation of the Moon and the ill fortunes (on an interficient day)
the sick shall dye.

But if she be elonged from the diameter of the distroyers of nature, Jupiter
or Venus also assisting the Moon, the sick shall recover.

The Moon in. of. oppressed.
WHen Saturn oppresses the Moon in Aquary (at the lying down of any sick
person) the disease shall proceed of much watch, lassitude, weariness, or
violent labor and exercise: The grief shall infest him unequally, with
remission, and intenston, until the moon come to her Opposition, and then he
shall relieve (chiefly) if the fortunes intermedle their favorable beams.

The Moon in. of. afflicted.
IF Mars afflict the Moon in Aquarius (at the lying down of the sick person)
he shall be grieved with a most acute and sharp cause.

And if the Moon apply to any of the fortunes (chiefly increasing in light and
motion) the diseased person shall not depart.

But if the Moon be corporally or raditionally adjoined or aspected of the ill
fortunes, then there will be small hope of life.

The Moon in. of oppressed.
THe Moon decreasing in light and motion, and afflicted of Saturn in Pisces,
the disease shall happen of refrigerations and cold^ bathings, with grievous
distillations, and continual Feauers, fearcely augmenting upon the sick:
often sighing and pricking of the breast, intention of the precordiace and
heart-stringes. Things that heat and mittigate does succor the sick body.

And if none of the fortunes regard the moon, but she is aspected and beheld
by the basilicall looks of furious Mars, or if the Moon^ obu^ateth also with
frowning Saturn, or is within his diameter, then there is no hope of life
(chiefly if the moon be deminished in light and motion) for then at the next
congression of ye moon with the distroyers of nature (on a dying day) the
sick person shall be forced to surrender his vital breath.

But if the moon apply to the fortunes either by Conjunction or aspect, the
sick shall relieve after the next mortal concourse of Luna with the fortunes,
chiefly if she be free from combustion, and augmenting in light and motion.

The Moon in of afflicted.
FInally if the Moon be in Pisces afflicted of Mars, (either corporally, or
radiationally and increasing in light and motion (at the decumbiture of any
person) then shall arise a grief proceeding of much ingurgitation of wine or
strong drinks, and of plentitude and cepleasion oppressing the sick with
^octurnall intensions, with headache doting and frenzy, with burning
Feauers, vehement thirst, and desire of could drink. The healing of such is
first by opening of a vein, and the usage of those things that repress the
cause.

And if the Moon be not succored by the fortunes, but is in domaged also by
lowering Saturn, then on the next interficient day that the Moon runs with
Saturn or Mars the sick shall depart.

But if Iupi^er or Venus regard the Moon (with friendly aspect) then on the
next critical, judicial, or mortal day, that the Moon pertranceth with the
bodies or amiable beams of the fortunes, the violence of the rebellious humors
shall be utterly extinguished.

Note here that the Moon apply to any of the distroyers of nature in what
sign soever she be, either by conjunction, application, or any aspect:
although it be only by the uniting and adjoining of their semidiameters, yet it
will work the like operation in diseased persons: but not so grievously nor
mortally, as the Conjunction, Quartile, or Opposition. For if the ill fortunes
behold the Moon (with Sextile, or Trine aspects) the disease shall not be
lethall: neither also in imperfect applications, Quartile, or Opposition:
whereas she is elonged, and separated from their beams (especially if the moon
be augmenting in light and motion) and aided by the beams of the fortunes.

Also according to some men's opinions, it profits much the diseased person,
if the fortunes or good stars are situated in the Meridian or Horizon (at
the decombiture or lying down of the sick body) and so contrary wise it
hinders the grieved person, if the ill fortunes occupy the said places.

The manner how to know of what Humor or Humors the grief proceeds.
. in.
IF the Moon be oppressed of Saturn (in the sign of Aries) the grief shall
happen of choler and melancholy, with some flegmaticke matter.

But if Jupiter and Mars oppress the moon, then the disease shall come of
some great putrefaction of humors, as in the Leprofie, Pocks, Measels, and
Leprofie.

If the Moon be in Sagittary and oppressed of Saturn, then the sick shall
be tormented with sharp and fretting Fleame corrupted with choler.

If the Moon be in Capricorn (afflicted by Saturn) the grief shall happen
of melancholy.

Mars afflicting the moon Capricornus, will cause a disease proceeding of
chollericke matter.

and sweet fleame.

Finally, if Saturn and Mars afflict the moon in Pisces, the diseases shall
proceed yeallow choler, and tough fleame congealed.

Thus much I have thought convenient to write of the judgment on sick folks,
when the day and hour of the lying down, or the descombiture (of the diseased
person) can by any means be serutated or nearly known: but if the day and
hour cannot be showed (in which the sick took his bed) then you must
contemplate the situation and collocation of the Planets, by a Celestial
figure erected for that time in which the question was demanded, or the
disease first demonstrated or showed: which manner of judicials I will now omit
(for breuities sake) until my next Addition: committing thee gentle Reader in
the mean whiles to the documents of G. C. in his Addition to the work of
worthy Darius, entitled The Judgment of the Stars: wherein he has
learnedly and copiously entreated thereof.

FINIS.
A Treatise of the four Humors.
THE body of Man is composed of four essential and hetrogeniall substances,
that is to say; Fleame, Blood, Choler, and Melancholy: which Physicians call
Humors or complections, and mixtures of those four simple qualities Heat,
Cold, Moisture, and Dryness: ^s Heat, and Moisture etc. which if they exceed
or alter that proportion that nature ordained them at the first (either in
quality or quantity) then shortly happens sickness, and discrasie.

The quality of the four Humors, and the times appropriated unto them.
FLeame is the original and primordination of the other Humors, and is
engendered of imperfect digestion, and is cold and moist in quality like the
water; and has most puissance in Winter, from the eight day of October until
the ninth of March, and from the third hour of the night until the ninth of
the said night. This humor is bred in the Liver, and has his abiding in the
stomach, and is known to exceed by these Signs: Sleepiness, Dullness,
Slownesse, Heaviness, Fatness, Cowardishnes, Forgetfulness, Spitting, Super
fluitie in the nose, little app^tie, indigestion, the skin whiter, colder,
and smoother in touching then it was wont to be: their Urine lower colored,
and thicker, and the Pulse lower and lesser then it was accustomed to be, with
dreaming of Rain, Floods and waters.

BLood is a Humor perfectly concoct, the chiefest nourisher and preserner of
our human nature, and is hot and moiste like the air, and increases in
Spring time, from the tenth of March, to the 24. of April, and has dominion
from the ninth hour of the night, until ^he third hour of the morning, and
has his abode in the veins, and is known to abound by these signs: the
Vesne^ great and full, carnositie, rednes of skin, pricking of the temples,
lightness of heart, the Pulse great and full, dreams of red and bloody
things, and pleasant conceits: their Urine will be higher colored and thicker
in substance then ordinarily.

Choler is the clarifier of the other Humors, and is bred of the substance of
the meat and drink exceedingly digested, and of some Author is called the
froth, or spume of blood, and is hot and dry in temperature like the fire; and
has power in Summer, from the 25. of April until the 17. of September, and
has dominion from the third hour of the day until the ninth hour of the
same: Signs; Leanness of body, C^stiuenesse, Hollownes of the eyes,
Fierceness, Angrynes, Yellownes of the skin, and spottell, and pricking in
the right side of the head, Hotnes, the Pulse is swift and strong, and their
Urine higher colored and thinner and brighter then usual with dreaming of
fire, lightning, Anger, and Fighting, and has his abitacle in the choffer of
the Galle.

Melancholy is a Humor imperfectly concect, and is called the dregs or
sediment of the other Humors, and is cold and dry like the Earth: But my
opinion is, that pure Melancholy is a gross and thick blood, and is black
of color by reason of the crassitude and thicknes, which happens by means
of indigestion and want of natural heat to extenuate it, and turn it into
pure blood, so that Melancholy natural differs from blood, chiefly by means
of colones, which congealeth and makes it drier and thicker then b^ood neither
do I suppose, that Melancholy is altogether so dry as it is cold, for as much
as we find few men in whose bodies Melancholy only has the superiority to
exceed in leannes or slendernes, but are rather of a mean proportion, etc.

Melancholy reigns in Harvest, from the 18. of September, until the eight
of Oct^ber, and has dominion from the ninth hour of the day, until the third
hour of ye night, and is perceived by these sig^es: Fearefulnes without cause,
dreadful unaginations, Fretfulnes, Roughnes of skin, Leanness, Blacknes, or
wanness of co^our, Insomniati^n, Dreams te^^ible, Saltnes of the mouth,
Sollitarines, the Pulse little, with Urine more decolored and thinner then
accustomed, and has his mantion and abiding in the Spleen.

And thus much of the temperature and quality of the four Humors, not
corrupted or altered, by the meddling of one with the other.

How the four Humors are distributed in men's bodies.
THe four Humors are proportioned and distributed in men's bodies two manner
of ways: (that is to wit) totally, and particularly:

Total or general distribution, is when one of them only has the
predomination and superiority, as he in whose body choler soly exceeds, is
called Choleric etc.

But particularly they are distributed after 12. sundry ways, as follows:

In some men's bodies* Choler only exceeds the other Humors, and that man I
call Chollericke.

And in some, Choler has che principal dominion, and Melancholy exceeds
the other Humors, and such a person I call cholleticke Melancholy.

But in some men, Melancholy has the sovereignty, and Choler has some
dominion, and those I call Melancholy chollericke.

In some, Melancholy soly exceeds, and such persens I term Melanchollicke.

In other, Melancholy has the superiority, and blood-some dominion, and they
I call melanchol^ike Sanguine.

In other, blood surmounteth, and melancholy has the next dominion, and such
persons I nominate sanguine Melancholic.

And in other, Blood only reigns, and such I call Sanguine.

But in other, Blood exceedes and Fleame has perticipation with it, and those
I call Sanguine flegmaticke.

Also in some, Fleame surpasses, and Blood has some dominion, such I call
flegmaticke Sanguine.

In other some, Fleame only has the pre-eminence, and such I call Flegmaticke.

And in other some, Fleame has mastery, and choler some domination: such
persons I call Flegmaticke choleric.

Also in sone men's bodies, Choler has the principal sovereignty, and Fleame
somewhat exceeds the rest, and such I call choleric Flegmaticke.

Hereat the ignorant perchance will find some matter to spurn, because I
have divided the complexions of men into so many sundry proportions: yet he
that is acquainted with the secret operations of nature and knows the
original cause of a man's complections and also observes the diversity of men's
colors, the sundry proportions of their bodies, and variety of conditions:
shall plainly perceive, that nature has many ways distributed them, and not
only by four manner of proportions, as I will herefollowing declare at large.

Of the original cause of men's Complexions.
THe complexion of man proceeds not of any natural procreation received from
his parents at the time of his conception, nor of the milk of the mother or
Nurse, wherewith the Infant is nourished (as some do imagine) But is infused
and proportioned according to the Celestial bodies, renolting over our Horizon
at the nativity of the Infant: for that Sign or Signs, which is colocated in
the ascendant or Horroscope, will certainly demonstrate and show of what
complexion the native is: for if you find in the first house a fiery sign
only situated, you shall judge that person to be chollericke of Complexion.

But if you find in the Horroscop the most part of a fiery sign, and some of
a earthy, then you shall call that person chollericke melancholicke, of
complexion.

And if the latter or least part of a fiery sign possess the ascendant, with
the more part of an earthy, you may call that person melancholicke chollerick.

Also if an earthy Sign occupy the whole Horroscope, that man shall be
melancholicke.

Or if you find in the first House the most part of a earthy Sign and some of
an airie, that person shall be melancholic sanguine.

But if the lesser part of an earthy Sign and the more of an airie possess
the ascendant, that man shall be sanguine melancholic.

Likewise if you find an airie sign occupying the whole ascendant, you shall
call that man Sanguine of complexion.

ger: the virtue of digestion is meetly strong in such persons, and their pulse
is lesser and slower then in chollericke persons, his urine is yellow and
thin, their egestion is yellowish and hard, and they dream of falling from
high places, of robberies, murders, harms proceeding of fire, fiighting and
anger, and such like.

Signs of a Melancholicke chollericke man.
MElancholicke choleric men are tall of stature, by reason that natural
heat is feeble, and thereby are many fumosities engendered, but yet they are
little and slender of body, because of dryness, therefore their skin is
rough and hard, and cold in toucking: they have but very little hair on their
bodies, and are long without beards, by means of cold which stop the
poores, and suffers not the matter whereof hair is engendered to come forth:
also they have much superfluity in the nose: their color is pale, shadowed
with a little nigritude or darkness. As concerning their conditions; they are
gentle, given to sobriety, solitary, studious, doubtful, auarous, shamefast,
timorous, stubborn, fretfull, penfiue, constant, and true in action, with a
deep surmise, and wit slow, with obliniousnes, their hair is brown and
thin, their digestion feeble and less then their appetite, the Pulse little and
slack, their Urine subcitrine and thin, and their egestion is fallow and
something soft, with dreaming of falling down from high places, fearful
dreams and sundry vanities.

Signs of a Melancholy person.
Melancholic men are mean of stature, and seldom very tall, for excess
cold does bind the substance and suffers it not to stretch in length: and
although melancholy be dry in temperature, yet they are not little and flender
of body, the occasion is (as I imagine) of excess cold (by means whereof much
superfluity is engendered) which somewhat delayeth the drines, for
melancholicke men are full of fleame, and rumaticke matter. Their color is
duskish and swarftish pale, their skin is rough, and cold in feeling, they
have very little or no hair on their bodies, and are long without beards, yea
sometimes beardlesse: the color of their hair is duskish and flaren: As
thouching their conditions, they are naturally covetous, selfe-louers,
cowardish, fearful without cause, pusilanimous, solitary, careful, lumpish,
inhumanious, seldom merry or laughing, stout, stubborn, ambitious, envious,
fretfull, obstinate in opinions, o^ a deep cogitation, mistrustfull,
suspicious, vered with dolors of the mind, and dreadful imaginations (as
though they were infested with evil spirits) and are very spightfull, curious,
squemish, and yet Slouens, having small rega^d of hansomenes, high minded, and
very maiesticall in behavior, and retain their anger long; the virtue of
concoction is in them very feeble, yet they have good appetite to their meat:
their Urine is palish and mean in substance and obtuse, their order is clayish
colored and broken, and they dream of dreadful things, terrible visians, and
darkness.

Signs of a Melancholic sauguine man.
MElancholicke Sanguine men are higher of stature then Melancholicke, for in
them natural heat is temperate, wherefore fumosities and radical moisture is
meanly engendered, whereby they are meanly big, fleshie, and firm of body:
their color is after a darkish red, their skin neither hard nor rough but
temperate in heat and softness, and not very hairie, they have beardes about
21. years of their age: As touching their conditions, they are more liberal,
bolder, merier, less slubborne, and not so cowarddish solitary, and pensive,
as melancholic persons, neither so vexed with evil imaginatio^s as they are:
also they are gentle, sober, patient, trusty, merciful, and affable: and to
conclude, forasmuch as this complexion is temperate in quality, so likewise
it is boon in conditions; for virtue is a mean between to extremes: Their
urine is light saffronish colored, and mean in substance, their pulses are
temperate in motion, and their order reddish and loose, with dreams pleasant,
and many times respondent to truth, their digestion is meanly strong.

Signs of a Sanguine Melancholicke man.
SAnguine Melancholic men are mean of stature, with bodies well compact with
veins and artires, fleshie but not fat, they drowsy, and sluggish as they
are, but merrier, and quicker witted, their face is for the most part full of
yellow sreckles, and their color white shadowed with yellowness, their
appetie and digestion is indifferent: their Pulses are moderate and full, their
Urine sub^itrine and mean in substance, with order yellow and thickish,
dreams of swimming in water, snow and rain.

Signs of a Choleric flegmaticke man.
CHollericke flegmaticke men are mean of stature, firm and strong of body,
and neither fat nor lean, with great legs and their skin hairie, and
moderate in feeling, their hair is yellowish, and their color is flane or
yellowish: their conditions is not much different from Chollericke men, but
they are not altogether so furious and bold as they, neither so prodigal, and
guilfull; for Fleame does somewhat delay the heat of choler, their digestion
is perfect, their Pulses swift, and their urine light saffron and thin, their
egestion yellow and hard, with dreaming of battles, strife, lightning and hot
water.

The opperation that eating, drinking, rest and exercise works in every
Complexion.
MVch eating and drinking in choleric persons (if not exceedingly out of
measure) does no harm, but rather conserueth ye good estate of the body, for
of much fasting and abstine^ce comes great detriment to those persons, for it
debilateth nature, co^sumeth ye body, engenders chollericke matter, and
sends up sower and unsavory vapors into the mouth, and breeds adustion of
humors (especially little eating of meats apt and easy to digest) for if a
Chollericke man will preserve his body in health, let him eat a mean quantity
of meats hard to defy, and a good deal of meats that are soon digested.
Also moderate drinking of small drink does much profit, for it cools
violent heat which inflameth and burns, and engendereth natural moisture
which will humect the ayred and dried parts by the rage of choler.

But much drinking of strong drink, and hot wines are utterly to be eschewed,
for they inflame the liver, and engender burning Feauers, Hecticks,
Exulcerations, and chollericke Pus^els, and the hot dropsy called Ashcites,
etc.

Much exercise and labor also does hurt the Chollericke person, for it
breeds Inflammations, adustion of humors, ye Iau^ders, ouerflowing of the
Galle, Consumptions, Hecticke Feauers, Tympanies, Costiuenesse, and Tercian
agues.

THe Collericke melancholicke man may well observe a mean measure in eating
and drinking, eschewing meats hard to digest, for such engender tough fleame
in their bodies.

Let him drink good drink measurably, but let him avoid excess of small drink
because it engenders congealed fleame and opillateth the pipes etc. And of
strong drink, for it breeds salt fleame, Itches, and Exulcerations.

Moderate exercise is very convenient to such persons.

But in Melancholicke cholerike persons, much eating, drinking, and rest, are
three champions striving against nature, and engendereth tough and congealed
fleame, darkeneth the skin and increases Morphew, oppillateth the pipes,
corruppeth the Lungs, and breeds the Tysicke, and Bleedings, Ventosity,
Chollicke and torments of the womb etc.

(And if they will conserve their bodies in health) Let them eat and drink
sparingly, and use strong drink and hot wines in small quantity: but let them
avoid excess (chiefly of small drink) for that cools the Liver, quenches
natural heat, hinders digestion, breeds the Dropsy, and repleateth the
body with flegmaticke matter, obnebulateth the memory, and repleateth the head
and pipes with superfluity: and after every little cold taken in the feet,
breeds rumes and ache of the womb. Also the immoderate use of strong drink,
breeds salt fleame corrupted with choler, causing Itches, and Prurigines.

THe Mclancholicke person must utterly avoid excess in eating and drinking
(especially of meats hard to digest, and small drinks) and use abstinence,
and a very slender diet, with meats apt to conc^ct, and hot drinks that
helps digestion.

Much ingurgitations of meats and drinks engendereth trudity, and raw^esse of
the stomach, with corrupt and tough congealed fleame, causing the breath to
stin^^e, headache, toothache, obliuiousnesse, shortness of wind, Physic,
consumption of the Lungs, quarten Feauers, Flures, the Illiacke and Choliack
passion, and the Dropsy, called Yposarca and such like.

Moderate exercise is very salubrious to such persons, for it helps digestion
and expels fantasies and imaginations, and refreshes the spiritual
members.

SAnguine melancholicke men are of a stronger constitution then Melancholicke,
and may eat mesurably of meat light of digestion, and drink indifferently of
strong drink: but excess (chiefly of meats indigestiue and small drink)
does fill the body with fleame and ventositie, and engenders thick and
black blood.

Moderate exercise consolidateth their bodies, putifieth their blood and
clarifieth their skin: and the like is to be understood in Melancholicke
Sanguine persons.

SAnguine men need not be very scripulous in their diet, so that they exceed
not two much out of measure: for in them the digestive virtue is most robust
and strong, perfectly concocting the meat and drink: such persons may eat
measurably of meats hard to defy, and a good quantity of me ^ts which are
soon digested.

Also they may drink a good quantity of small drink, but ercesse engendereth
clammie and sweet fleame, which oppilateth the poores and conduits of the body,
and ingendeteth Feauers, the cholicke and stone, and forments of the back.

The inordinate usage of strong drinks and hot wines does inflame the blood,
and breeds hot rumes, Saint Anthonies fire, squimsies, Plurisies, Kings
evil, Apostuinations in the Liver, and red Pimples in the face.

Likewise violent exercise is to be eschewed, for it enflameth the Liver,
chafeth the blood, and engenders the Yellow Ianders, ouerflowings of the
Galle, and Ephemer feauers.

IN Sanguine fleginaticke men, digestion is meanly strong, and they may eat
and drink well of meats and drinks of good temperature and apt to digestion:
But much ingurgitation of meats and drinks ingendereth thin and watery
blood, the small Pox, Exulcerations, cholicke etc.

Let them drink measurably of drinks meanly strong, but excess of small
drink, makes the color the whiter, and their bodies the grosser, and fills
the breast with superfluity, and e^gendeceth dropsies, Goutes, Ache of the
joints, Apoplexies, Lytharge, and dulnes of memory.

The excess usage of strong drink, does work the like effect as in Sanguine
men but not altogether so violently: moderate exercise is very profitable.

THe man in whose body fleame has the superiority, and blood has some
dominion over the rest of the Humors, let him keep a slender diet, and beware
of the repleation: for much eating and drinking in such persons makes the skin
tawnie, with rawnesse in the stomach, and repleateth the body with citrine and
yellow choler, and sower fleame, and engendereth the Measels, dulleth the wit,
and abateth courage: let such use hot wines and strong drinks in small
quantity, for excess drinking is to be eschewed; for it makes the skin
greenish or tawnie, and engenders dropsies, Goutes, Pockes, and fleame, green
choler, and vnsauonry fumes in the mouth. Let them use exercise, for it
cleanses their bodies of superfluities.

FLegmaticke men of all other ought to use a very small and slender diet, for
the usage of abstinence and fasting helps the digestive virtue, and cleanses
the body of gross and unconcocted Humors:

But contrarily, much eating and drinking quenches natural heat, hinders
digestion, and repleateth the body wi^^ grove humors and superfluity, bredeth
stitches and ventositie etc.

If they will conserve their bodies in health, let them eat and drink very
little, and use meats that will soon be digested, and strong drink and hot
wines.

But let them avoid excess of drinking for that engenders Quotidians, the
Dropsy called Lencoflemna, Falling sickness, Goutes, Green sickness, Rumes,
Catarres and such diseases as are bred of indigestion. Much exercise also is
very salubrious to the bodies of such persons, for it extenuateth gross Humors
and expel^eth them by swet and other euacuations, quickneth the memory,
stirs up courage, and clarifieth the skin.

FLegmaticke choleric men are of a stronger nature then Flegmaticke persons,
(for in them the virtue of digestion is quicker) and may observe a mean order
of diet, but excess fills their bodies with yellow choler, and such
diseases as proceed thereof.

Also much excess of drinking engenders corrupt matter, Morbus gallicus,
Fistula, etc.

Moderate exercise is commodious to this complexion.

CHollericke Flegmaticke persons are of strong constitution, and may eat and
drink a good quantity, slender diet and abstinence does work the like
operation in them as in chollerick, but not so outragiously.

Much excess of strong drink inflameth the blood, and ingendereth yellow
Iaunders, and Plurisyes.

Let them use one exercise moderatly: but beware of violent labor.

Here is to be noted (gentile Reader) that exact judgment cannot be given
upon a man's complexion by any one of the aforesaid tokens, for as much as they
are all variable and changeable: yet of rest, the color is most certain in
our Ocean climats, and in healthful persons, but foreign Climes and sickness
alters the color: also the Stature, Trine, Pulse, and Order of a person,
changes after the order of diet and health of the party: also the conditions
alters sometimes when grace works above nature, or when some fortunate
Planet is Lord of the nativity And as for dreams, they (...) ^^gether variable,
one while proceeding of some inordinate musing and thinking of a thing, whereby
the virtue cogitiue is troubled, and imprinteth the same in the brain,
sometimes of the humor bred and engendered in the stomach, euapouring into the
head: and otherwhiles the illusion of evil spirits, or by the Revelation of
good Angels. And to conclude, a man's complexion alters according to age and
diet of the person, as natural heat aug^^enteth or defecteth.

Laus sit Deo omnipotenti.
The Epilogue of the Author.
OMightie Jove to thee be praise, that rules and reigns on hie,
Thy Majesty extolled is above the Starry sky.
Thou that the heavens and earth of confusde Chaos made
The Son and Moon and twinkling Stars,
Bright day and nightley shade,
Who can express thy wondrous works, thy wisdom, power and might:
No Saint nor Angel can do it, much less a mortal Wight.
Thou that from wise and pregnant wits, thy Arcanes do conceal:
And unto Babes and simple men, thy secrets do reveal:
Let Cherubin and Seraphin, laudate thy name always:
And hills and dales, resound a voice to echo forth thy praise
Also let man and beast likewise, thy worthy acts admire:
And every living thing on earth, thy condign praise aspire.
Thou can the dead to life reujue, and to the blind give sight:
And eke bring out of Stigian vale, so forcely is thy might.
For why the life of every thing, is in thy hand O Lord.
And may do with it what thou will, if that thou say the word
Thou that the Sun for certain days, did cause to stay and stand
Until thy people Israel, had got the upper hand,
Can bridle frowning Saturns rage, and bloody Mars withhold
and bring the Sick to perfect health what ever Stars foreto^de.
For thou alone art only he, that all things do respect:
And rulest fate and future haps, for love of thine elect.
Unto the Father vncreat, and Jesus Christ his Son:
And unto God the holy Ghost, all laud and praise be done.
FINIS.
