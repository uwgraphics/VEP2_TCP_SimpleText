The perlyament of deuylles


AS Mary was grette with Gabryell
And had conceived and borne a child
All the deuylles of the earth / of ye air and of hell
Held their parlyament of that maid mylde
What man had made her womb to swell
To tempt her ye tend to sylde
Her chyldes fader who can tell
Who did with her tho works wild
In hell the fendes tho answered
We knew never fader that he had
But among prophets we have lered
That god with man had conuenaunt made
A serpent in desert was rered
So shall gods sone in man be had
The soul of him shall be vnspered
His heart to cloue and he forblad
These prophets speak so in mist
What they meant we never knew
They spoke of one should hight Christ
But Maryes sone hight Ihesu
And they said ye Christ with god should be atwyst
But this Ihesu never in the godhede grew
We ben begyled all with our list
The clothe is all of another hew
And though god make his parlyment
Of peace / mercy / truth / and reason
And from heaven to earth his sone be sent
In mankind to take a ceason
We shall ordain by one assent
A preuy counceyle all of treason
And claim Ihesu for our rent
For yt he is kind of man it is good cheson
Write we his name whyder we speed
Sychen to us he is unknown
For though he be come of strange sede
Yet in Adams ground was he sown
When he is type do we our deed
Look that we do him repe and mowne
For though god him self our rolls read
By right we challenge Ihesu for our own
To me master devil it lies
To Ihesu will I take heed
To nourysshe him in fantasyes
His freyle flesh both to clothe and feed
And though that he be never so wise
Yet out of the way I will him led
And make of him both fool and nyse
And in hell his soul bread
Thus the deuylles their wyles cast
With their arguments great
And thyrty year they founded fast
To tempte Ihesu in many an hete
In to a wyldernes with Ihesu I past
Of him knowledge for to get
And forty days there did he fast
Without sleep drink or mete
The master devil wonder thought
Of Ihesus worthy compleccyon
By man's fode lived he naught
But by prayer and devotion
But when he hongred as me thought
To tempte him than I made me bowne
Lo here ben stones hard wrought
Make thereof breed to man's foysowne
Forsothe Ihesu said not only in bread
Is verily man's propre living
But every word of the godheed
To body and soul is confortynge
Upon an high pynacle I him brought anon
And left him there and adowne I spronge
And said save the harmeles both lymme and bone
And do now maystryes while thou art young
If thou be gods sone let se
Of the is written long agone
Aungelles in hondes should bear the
Leest thou spurn thy foot at a stone
Ihesus said in holy write thou may se
Tempte not thy lord god living alone
With all thy might in every degree
Thou shalt him serve and other none
The devil saw it might not gain
Of Ihesu his purpose he began mysse
He brought him to an high mountain
And badde him do as he would wysse
And there he showed him for certain
Iewelles richesse and worldly bliss
Worship me here and become my swayne
And I shall give the all this
Go Sathanas from bliss thou hye
From heaven rich that ryall toure
In Exody it is written certainly
Thyn lord god thou shalt honor
Alas quod the devil how art thou so wytty
Thy words are bitter / thy works are sour
Thy conclusyon knytteth me so fervently
I abode never so sharp a shoure
The deuylles gadred their great frame
And held their parlyament in the mist.
One would ryfle us at hame
And gadre the flower out of our twyst
New Iaylours would wait us shame
One men called him Johan baptyst
But now he has turned Ihesu is his name
That first hight Ihesu now is Christ
Laugh ne sport I him never saw
But in stablenes he is always
And straytly keeps gods law
And strongly withstandeth mine affray
To works of vice he will not draw
A wonders word I herd him say
The great temple he would down thrawe
And reyse it again on the third day
When he was borne wonders befell
Over all was peace both eest and west
In Rome of oil there spronge a well
From trystmer to tyber it ran pressed
In Rome the temples down fell
Their mawmettes did all to breast
Aungelles to shepeherdes glory began tell
In earth to all mankind both peace and rest
The emperor in Rome stood hye
Three sons in one he saw shynynge clear
In the mids of them a maiden he sye
A man child in her arms did bear
The emperor and Cybyll spoken prophecye
And they accorded both in fere
And said gods sone mankind should bye
It is a token the time draws nere
Also three kings came from far
To worship Ihesu all they sought
Which rey^ed Herodes hette therre
Him to sle for they so wrought
By the lyghtnynge of a sterre
To Ihesu all three presents they brought
Homewardes an angel taught them nerre
Another way than they had thought
Than I counceyled Herod within a while
To dystroye the formest prophecy
That all men children in town and pyle
To sle them yt Ihesu might with them dye
He fled in to Egypt in that while
Their mawmentes fell down from on hye
He knew my thought and saw my gyle
I might not hyde me from his eye
To tempte Ihesu it will not avail
Of the worlds good he has no need
I lose on him so much travail
The more I so work the worse I speed
With the sharper assautes I him assail
The less of me he stands in dread
The bolder in byker I bid him battle
The less of me he takes head
For if I tempte him with wrath or pride
With pacyence and mekenes he scomfyteth me
If I tempte him with lechery I must me hyde
He voydeth me of with chastyte
In glotony and envy he will not abide
But is ever in mesure and charity
In couetyse and auaryce he will not ride
But is ever in largess and pouerte
The devil said neither in hot ne cole
I may not make him stumble ne fall
I wist him never go to scole
And yet I saw him dyspute in the scole hall
He set him self on the highest stole
And argued against the masters all
Some called him wise / some called him fool
But gods sone he does himself call
His works passes man's kind
For crooked and creples he makes right
For deef and dombe and borne blind
He gives them speech herynge and sight
Mad men he gives them their mind
He makes mesels hole and light
Alegyon of fendes in a man he did find
All he drove out through his might
Wine of water he makes blyue
And does many a wonders deed
With two fysshes and loves five
Five thousand men I saw him feed
Twelve lepes of relefe thereof did thryue
To men and children that had need
Deed men he raised again on live
And yet wered he never but one wede
He handles neither money ne knyfe
Neither in sin desires he any woman to kiss
But ones he saved a wedded wife
In spousayle that had done amysse
He is so wonderful in life
I can not know well what he is
I would he had ended our strife
He is out of our books / and we out of his
Sythen I him first tempte began
I saw him never change hew
Ones he bad me go foul Satan
Evermore that reprefe I rewe
In works he is god / in person a man
Like to him I never none knew
Where learned he all the wit that he can
For every day he does wonders new
I followed him ones to a place
To a mountain upon hight
Peter Johan and James there was
Hely and Moses stood there vpryght
I would have seen Ihesus face
But I might not it shone so bright
The sothfast son did it enbrace
The bright beams blent my sight
To let the prophecy soon I went
The Jews to sle Ihesus I gave them choice
If he deye on the rode we shall be shent
I would not that they had given that voyse
I was woe for that Judgment
Of crucifige to here the noise
Pylates wife I bad besyly give tent
That Ihesu were not done on the croyse
Yet the Jews for his deeds good
False wytnes against him conspyred
And nailed him upon the rode
And payned him there till that he deyed
Under his left side I my self stood
And after his soul straytly spyed
I wist never whyder it yode
When he gave it up so manly he cried
The son and moon lost their light
The elements fought as light thonder
The earth quaued and mountains on hight
Valeys and stones breast asonder
Deed men arose through his might
To bear wytnes of that wonder
My mind failed I lost my sight
I wist not how soon I came there under
Ihesus soul is gone I wot not where
So pryuely he did fro me pas
When his heart was perced with a spear
Than wist I well who he was
Orderne we us with all our gere
For hyder he thinks to make a race
Arise we all that been bounden here
And styfly defend we our place
For if that he would hyder come
We shall go euerychone
Against him both all and some
And tere of him bone from bone
Than said Lucyfer anon
It is but waste to speak so
The spyryte of him is now hyder come
For to work us all woe
There as the good souls did in dwell
They cheyned the gates and barred them fast
Anon Ihesus said / ye princes fell
Open the gates that ever shall last
And let in your king of heaven and hell
The deuylles asked him than in have
Who is the king of bliss thou do of tell
Wenest thou to make us all aghast
Strong god and king of might
I am lord and king of bliss
Usurper of death mighty in fight
Everlasting gates open without mysse
Both peace mercy troth and right
I brought them at one and made them to kiss
Everlasting gates open on hight
And let in your king to take out his
For I the soul of Ihesu christ am come hyder
Witness thereof my body in earth lies deed
And the holy ghost with the soul together
That never shall part fro the godheed
In heuens bliss ye stood full slyder
Through pride ye offended my faders bid
Man's soul for mekenes shall come hyder
There as ye fendes forfeyted that stead
Than said Lucyfer god did forbede
To Adam in paradyse but one tree
On pain of death to have for that deed
And after in hell ever to be
And thou art come of Adams sede
Therefore by right we challenge the
For in holy write thou may read
In hell is no remyde
Ihesu said Lucyfer troth thou tellest me
But thou wotest not thy self how
There is a bond hell / but this is fre
The bond hell was ordained for you
For that ye man forfeyted through a tree
Through a tree again bought is he now
Thou made him sin ye pain longs to the
For thou waytest never good to man's prow
Lucyfer thou me vndernome
And said yt I was of the sede of Adams kyn
Forsothe I did out of the godhede come
And took flesh and blood a maid within
For as of ye sede of earth there spryngeth blome
So met we and parted without sin
Thyn argument is false so is thy dome
By what right would thou me win
Who was chief of thy counsel
In heaven when thou forfeyted the blys
In paradyse Adam thou dydest assail
And tempted him to forfeyte his
And I in his quarrel took battle
Against my fader to amend his mys
Wherefore of thy purpose thou shall fail
For thy quarrel naught it is
Than Lucyfer answered again
Why spekest thou so to me here
It was but wanton words in vain
I trow thou come hyder us to fere
Sometime when I was in heaven on hye
That I there lost for my pride certain
Here after I hope full sykerly
For to come to that bliss again
Christ Ihesu spoke to Satan tho
And said to him in this manner
It is but waste to speak so
Or any such words to utter here
That time while thou in heaven were
Full much Joy had thou tho
For all thy felawes were glad there
But right soon it was ouergo
Lucyfer spoke to him again
And said to him with words sere
Here have I dwelled in woe and pain
More than four thousand year
Help me to that bliss again
The which I lost for my pride there
For there in it is pleasure certain
To dwell with aungelles shynynge clear
Here me Lucyfer I shall the tell
Or ever any thing was wrought
Heaven or earth air or hell
Forsothe than I made the of naught
In heaven when thou stodest well
I made the above aungelles all
But thereof cared thou never adele
Such pride in thyn heart began fall
In heaven when thou were at thy will
Thou myghtest have been in peace and rest
I took the my sete full still
It to seem thou were full pressed
And while I went where me list
And come again anon on hye
Thou said thou were worthyest
And to sit there as well as I
And thou repentest the never more
But ever aggredest thy trespace
Adam wept and syghed sore
And asked mercy and oil of grace
My fader sent me hither therefore
And on a tree let death me chase
A spear through my heart began bore
And let out the worthyest oil that ever was
In my faders name of heaven
Open the gates against me
As light of air and thonder leven
The gates to brast and began to fle
God took out Adam and Eve full even
And all his chosen company
The prophets said with mylde steven
A song of wonders now sing we
Aha said Adam my god I se
He that made me with his hand
I se said Nowhere comes he
That saved me both on water and land
Quod Abraham I se my god so fre
That saved my sone from bitter bond
Tho said Moses the tables he betoke me
His law to preche and understand
Quod Dauyd we spoke of one so stout
That should break the brazen gates
Quod zachary and his folk take out
And leave there still such as he hates
Quod Symeon he lyghtneth his folk in dym
Where as derkenes shedeth their states
Tho said Johan this lamb I spoke of him
That all the worlds sin abates
Our lord them took by the hand
And brought them to the place of bliss
And said to them I understand
This bargayne I have bought or this
For rich and poor fre and bond
That will ask grace and amend their mysse
Shall be with you here Ioconde
In my kingdom heuens bliss
Thus Ihesu christ harowed hell
And led his servant to paradyse
With the other helles would he not mell
Where fendes black bounden lyse
And where dampened souls ever shall dwell
That will not amend but ever be nyse
Tourmented with horrible deuylles fell
That sometime were aungelles of price
Hell repreued tho the devil Satan
And horrybly began him despise
To me thou art a shrewde captan
A combred wretch in cowardyse
Tho said Lucyfer sythen ye world first began
I have brought hyder many a great price
Hyder in to hell of all kind of man
Both true false folysshe and wise
Hell so worshypped never thou were
I^ thou coudest have kept the so
I brought the both god and man in fere
Why were thou so nyce to let him go
Quod hell not with thy powere
I might not warn him one of tho
He took out all that were him dear
I might not let him though he would mo
Quod Belsabub I barred full fast
The gate with lock / chain / bolte / and pyn
And with one word of his mouths blast
They brake up and he came in
He bound me and down me cast
It is no bote to strive with him
When the dredefull dome is come and past
Our endless pain is than to begin
Though the Jews made Ihesu to dye
Yet on the third day he rose to life again
It was to him more vyctory
Than though he had all the Jews slain
Some were glad when they him se
Some were fory and some were said
And sometime in one company
Among five hundred he was feign
Of oyntementes full many a drop
Mary mawdeleyne to Ihesu she brought
Ihesu went from her a little sloppe
And said mawdeleyne touch me naught
All his dyscyples were in wanhope
For to conforte them Ihesu thought
And bad them his wounds handle and grope
I have flesh and blood so spyrytes have naught
Thomas was of right hard believe
Till he had spoken with Ihesu tho
Ihesu spoke with words breue
Come hyder Thomas and speak me to
For here thou may now the sothe preue
How that I was on the rode ydo
And he that will not on it believe
Shall for ever to pains go
Than said Ihesu with mylde speech
To his dyscyples I will ye go
To all creatures about to preche
Mine vprysynge to friend and fo
And tho that believe that ye teache
Bodies and souls saved ben tho
And they that believe not I say to each
They shall for ever to pain go
Fro you fendes shall fle for my name
Addres and venym shall from you stele
Though ye drink poison it shall you not tame
Neither harm you ne no grefe feel
I shall new tongues in you frame
All manner of language forth to dele
And they that ye touch seek or lame
Body and soul I will them hele
Our lord after his resurreccyon here
In earth he was forsothe dwelling
Till holy thursday comen were
That he styed to heaven where he is king
At the drefull dome without lesynge
Both quycke and deed there shall he deem
God give us grace in our living
To serve our our god and Mary to queme
Of all the children that ever were borne
Save only Christ himself alone
Was none so holy here beforne
As was this holy child saint John^
That baptized our lord in flome Iordone
With full devout and good devotion
And after for Ihesus love to death began gone
And suffered full great passion
Now shall I tell with full good chere
Of that holy assumpcyon
Of his blyssed mother dear
How she was taken up with full great devotion
Unto her blyssed sone as her will were
That thereto sent his aungelles adowne
And up they bare that maiden clear
Queen of heaven they did her crown
Than all thaungelles that were in heaven
Were at the crownynge of that maid fre
And song all with mylde steven
Gloria tibi domine
That is a song of Joy and bliss
God give us grace that light to se
Of his mercy that we not mysse
Oui natus es de virgin
This tale that I have told you here
Is called the deuylles parlyament
Thereof is red in time of the year
On the first sunday of clean lent
Who that will for heaven procure
Keep him fro the deuylles combrement
In heaven his soul may than be sure
With aungelles to sing in light splendent
This lesson of new was made but late
There be no tryfles in it at all
The deuylles boost thus began he bate
Our curteyse Christ / our king ryall
He help us all in at heuens gate
With saints to sit there out of thrall
Christ keep us out of harm and hate
For thyn holy spyryte so special
Amen.
Thus ends the parlyament of deuylles. Enprynted by Wynkyn de word prynter /
unto the most excellent pryncesse my lady the kings mother. The year of our
lord. M.CCCCC. and.ix.
