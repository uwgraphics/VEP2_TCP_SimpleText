George Joy confuteth / Uvinchesters false Articles.
I Chanced upon certain Articles / entitled to the Bishop of Winchester
called Steven Gardener which were written against doctor Barnis and his. ij
felows bre^t M. D. xxxix for preching / only faith to iustifye. By these his
articles / Winchester would prove that works must iustifye / that is to say /
with owr works we must merit the remission of owr sins. Which doctrine /
as it is contrary to Gods word / so is it iniuriouse to Christis blood. Whose
godly name is / One Genes* xvij.
alone for all sufficent / even that same precious hid tresure in the gospel /
in who^ (says Math. xiij
Paul) are all the tresures of wisdom and knowledge hyden. For in him dwellethe
the Col. ij.
most perfect fulness of god verelye / and in him ar we complete / eue^ perfitly
justified / with out any inweiuing of Winchesters works. This thing do I tell
you (says Paul) lest any man (as now would Winch.) decoy^e you with his
apparent Popissh perswasio^s. This full iustificacion by only faith Paul
Hebre. vij.
expresses clearly in these words also. This owr everlasting living priest and
intercessour Christ abides for ever unto this end / even absolutely / fully /
and perfitly with out any lak or breach to save all them that through him by
faith come to God the father. Here ar we taught Christ to have an everlasting
preisthod / to save perfitly and suffici ently through owr faith only / and that
he ever lives unto thissame end. Wherefore for the defense of owr so plentuouse
and perfect Psalm. C. xxx.
redemption / and for the rich favor and mer cye of owr heavenly father and
free forgeuenes in christis passion through owr faith only / and that the
glory of his grace whereby Ephe. 1
he has made us his derelye beloved chosen childern through his beloved sone
should be praised / by whom we have redempcio^ through his blood even the
remission of sins according to the riches of his so plentuouse grace unable
to be minisshed / to defend this my lord gods glory (I say) and to warn the
simple unlearned that they be not deceived by siche blasphemouse Bisshops
articles / I shall by gods help justly by his word clerly confute them /
althouge he yet teach and preche them into his own dampnacion and deceiving of
as many as believe him.

In Paul's time there strayed about a certain idle sort and sect of heretyks
called Nazares / or Minei / the most subtyle kind of men in paintinge and
perswadinge their false doctrine. These heretics troubled and perverted the
chirchis well instituted of the apostles / especially the Galathens /
Antiochens and Romans / agenst whose heresies Paul did write so mightily and
ernestly co^futing the^. These pharisais labored in the same heresye in which
/ Winch. now techeth and writes / mixinge the observance of the law with the
grace of the gospel / eue^ works with faith to iustifye. These Nazares
confessed Christ to be god and man / that he dyed rose again etc^: but unto him
only / through owr faith they attributed not all owr wholl iustificacion /
but part thereof (as now does Win.) to the works of the law as unto our own
merits / and part to his passion making christ a savior to halues. But is
christ divided i. cor. i.
says Paul? These heretyks descended out of the faccion of the pharisais / as
now do owr iusticiaries owte of the Pelagians / whose rightwysues (says
Christ) except Mat. v
owrs excel more abounda^tly we shall never come to heaven. These Nazares were
Jews born / but in name they would be called christians / and yet nothing
holdinge the benefit of the grace by christ / confounding the law with the
gospel / merits mixed whith grace / free forgeuenes with deserving by works /
contendinge noman to be saved by christ recepte he being circumcised kept the
law of Moses. Agenste whom Paul with so great labor / far otherwise
instituted his chirches / preching and writing constant ly owr sins to be
known and showed us by the law and not thereby to be taken away only the
grace of faith through christ to msti^re all nations. Happy it was that those
heretyks sprung up in his days / whose pistles we have yet so mightily and
clearly co^fusing and pressing down these heresies now crepte up agene by Winch.

The chief articles of the christen religion upon the which all other ar stayed
and grown ded / is that in christ Jesus is all sufficiencye Col. ij. ^^eb^^.
vij.
and perfeccion of forgeuenes of sins and salvation / of whose fulness we
receive grace for grace as says John / wherefore as many as be justified / ar
justified by thonelye faith Joan. ^.
in him / and by nothing else as by any subsydiary attaynment (as Winchester
would have his helping wilworks) unto this full iustificacio^ in christ the
perfeccio^ of the law. Romans x
This is the some of the hole gospel. This is the stacion of the cause / the
argument and material of all Paul's pistles / eue^ the treadsole or growndsole
where upon as the door is tur ned and returned / so ar all his arguments and
process there upon treated and retreated / and specially in his pistles to
the Romans Gala. and Hebrews* And now since this Bishop stereth up af^esshe
these old heresies / we can have no better armor and arguments the^ Paul
made agenste him / fixste warninge us of siche sedicious sect sowers saing.
There are many ru^nres abroad of whom I warned Phili. ^
you oftyn / but now with weeping tears I warn you again / eue^ of the enemies
of christ's cross whose end is dampnacion / whose belie is their god / and
their glory shall end with shame / whose care and study is set upon
erthelye things. I can not meruel enoughe at this bishop fyghting so ernestly
for good works to justify / that he does none himself / but persecute
christ's church so cruellye / presone petiously and destroy the pore innocent
lombes of God / christis own body. I pass over his luciferyn pride /
aff^bicion / arroga^cye viciouse living etc / above Nero / Iuliane / Traiane /
Herod or any soft Sardanapale. Belyke he believes not his own articles / for
if he did / he would do better works for his own iustificacio^. The fru tes of
Paul's faith being once a pharisaye of i. co. xv
Win. opinion / were the persecucion of christ's chirch above mesure as himself
testifyeth Gala. i
/ and as all like pharisais have ever done Phil. iij
and do it still unto this day / God convert i. ^imo. i
them once as he did Paul / So be it.

We therefore / with Paul and Christ / affirm owr only one alone Savior
Christ for his own merits and owr faith into him through the favor of his
father apeaced in him / to iustifye / that is / to absolve us from owr sins
and to give us life eternal. This owr only savior we preche and write to ^.
cor. i.
be the only rightwysues / wysedom / holymaker / redemption and satisfaccion
sufficient for all that believe in him. And if there be any that think christ's
rightwysues his satisfaccion his merits and redemption made for us of his
father / not a sufficient iustificacio^ and forgeuenes of their sins / but
that they must set their own works chekmate with his passion and redempcio^
to help forth unto the attaynment of this effect of christis passion / well /
let them couple and wrapin their own works to for their iustificacion / and
the^ in so doing shall they procure their own da^p nacio^. For all owr good
works or rightwisnes Isaye. lxiij
(says Isay) ar right filthye and naught and so miche the worse then naught
for that they be set in so high a place egall with christ's blood / which is
a plain blasphemye. These unright rightwysemakers would serve two contrary
masters at once / the Pope and God to / the gospel and the popis lawis iij.
king xviij.
but whyls they thus halt on both sydis with ^aal^ preistes they serve trwlye
the devil which has no concord with christ / nether shall there any papiste
nor christian believe them / for in conclusion you shall see them to be
justified nether by works nor faith but damp^ed for their unbelief / noman
beleui^g nor loving them / by their wiked works pro curinge themselves the
hatered of all men. Now to his articles.

Ah good faith / where have thou ben all this George Joy

before faith / or faith before his worcester kes? By his process / works go before
faith and so must his workis be sin and displea sure to god. For what soever
is not of faith ^o. xiiij Hebr. xi
(says Paul) is sin. And with out faith it is impossible to please god. If

Blessed ar they Ioa^. xx
that believe and see not. Now must winch* prove his condition with the
fulfilling and knowledge thereof to be things invisible / hoped for / as eternal
life etc^ / or else his faith shalnot be that faith which Paul diffineth and
christ so often mencioneth in his gospel.

This faith comith of god / this faith Win. iij article.
is a good gift / it is good and profitable to me. It is profitable to me to do
well and to exercise this faith.
This faith so farof flitted from thinuisible iustificacion / whether it be the
gift of god and George Joy
profitable to winchester I dowt it* but this am I sewer of by christ's own
words / that when winch. has done all that god has commanded him (which I
dare say he shall ^u. xvij*
never do / and so never fulfill his condition) yet is he but a servant (if he
be not a ^orde) unprofitable. I would ask win. when he looks and considers
first theffect of christ's passion / whether he believed it or no? If he did not
believe / so was he the^ an infidel^. If he believed it (seeing it is the promised
forgeuenes of sins in crystis blood) whether bele ued he it to be effectuous
to himself or only to other men? If to other and not to himself / ^^ is his
faith and the devils faith all one. (...) believed his own sinnis to be forgiven
thereby so was he justified by faith only ere any other condition was known or
spoken of / or else he must make christ a liar which says. ^s thou beleuest
so come it to the. When Iairus Math. xv.
desiered christ to come and help his daugh ter / and in christ's coming /
Iairus his servant met him saying / decease not christ owr master no farther /
for your daughter is dead. What said christ? said he not to him / fear not?
Believe only and she shall be salfe. These same words (Only believe) stand
both in Mark and ^uke. What co^dicio^ else the^ faith ^u. viij Mar. v
only in christis promise can Win. find to enjoy theffect of christis
passion? Christ (all conditions else set aside) only faith mentioned / said.
Thy faith has saved the. What co^ dicion else then faith did Christ require of
the child's father praying him to cast the evil Mar. ix
spirit out of his sone? Added he any thing else then faith / saying. If thou
can^te believe all thingis ar possible to the beleuer? Away winchester with
your confuse comberouse condition / sonde fulfyllinges and your craftye
knowledge* and abuse not the precyouse gift of faith to serve yowr syn full
affectes to prove your blasphemouse co^ clusyon. But yet perchance Winchester
will answer to my former question / That when he beholds the forgeuenes of
his syn nes in crystis passion / he sees also therewith his condition. Well /
be it so / The^ ask I him whether the forgeuenes of his sins there beholden /
and himself hearing Christ call linge and krying / Come unto me Wui^. laden
with sins and I shall case the / whether (I say) is it more profitable for
him by faith to sethold of the forgeuenss of his sin nes now offered him by
christ that can not lie / or to tarry and send him word / that he will first
know and fulfill his condicon? A wise man would think it most profitable to
set hold first by faith upon his iustificacio^ freely now offered him and to
take the thing certain and present / rather then so precious a gift neglected /
to labor in an uncertain condition / For if his condition be the worcester kis of
the law (as he will not deny it) which it is impossible for any flesh to
fulfill / as Paul affirms / and all owr best works ar ^o. viij
infected with Adams birth poison stained like the sike womans clothes as I
say says. I say lxiij.
And if Win. (I say) tarry till he has fulfill led his condition / he shall
come to short of his iustificacion in christ. For ere he begins to fulfill
the condition he is disobedient to christ's calling and refuses the forgive
nes of his sins / of which unfaith full diso bedience what soever deed
follows it is sin ne / yea and that a grievous sin as Samuel ^. of the ^ig.
xv.
eraggerateth it unto king Saul albeit he did it (as they say) of a good
e^tent. Now say on yet again winchester.

Ergo by the gift of god I may do ^in. iiij Article.
well before I am justified.
Yea mary / this is the co^clusio^ I waited for. ^^o^^e Joy
^o / now has he concluded of himself / that he may do well before he be
justified. This his well doing stands upon the fulfilling of his co^dicio^ /
where ye see he has his faith and his works and yet is he not instifyed /
ergo in that same time before he is justified is he not justified by faith nor
by his works Here ye see plainly into what confusion be bringith himself / and
what it is to reason by his own wit withowt any word of scripture. Would god
the papists had no wyser ^iuines to defend their false religion / selde^ ar
these popisshe lawers good divines. He says he may do well / and I say he may
do evil to. It becomes a learned man so to confer the scriptures trwly
vnderstande^ that he be sewer and certain of his co^clusio^. But perchance he
take this word May / for the merry mo^the of May next april / and then am I
content to tarry till May come age^e for the verifying of his conclusion waiting
for his well doing / for hitherto (god knows) he has done miche evil. The
lord amend him before May / or else take him shortly away Ame^. Because Win.
has no scrip ture to prove his conclusion / I will help him but yet I commend
Standish agenst Doctor Barnes / for he laid on scriptures wryte^ and unwritten /
englisshed and vnenglisshed as thik as hayle / and understood not one word what
he said / even the very doctors painted of Paul to have erred fr^ the trwe
faith i. timo. i
and love / and ar swaruen unto vain lies / which would be seen Doctors of
the law and yet understand they not what they say nor of what thing they
affirm. But to Win. conclusion / Thou know good reader / that in scripture
there is mentioned a dead faith i. timo. i
and a feigned or false faith. And also there is a rightwysnes of the law or
owr rightwys Roma. ix. and. x.
nes and also a like iustificacion / one of faith before god and a another of
works before men. When Paul had mightily proved only faith to have justified
before God / the Jew not To. iij.
being content with this concluson objected saying. What then shall we say of
owr father Abraham? Got he no iustificacion by To. iiij.
his works? he was a good father and did ma ny good dedis. It is trweth says
Paul / but yet has he not to rejoice thereof before god / but only before men.
Now let us set up my Lord Gardener in his Deluets and Saty^ alo^te upon his
^^le trapped with velvet with gylden sterups and bridle etc / with his ientle
men bare head chayned with gold / before and aftir him. Who wilnot say but
there rides a princely prelate a gloriouse Bishop to orne and honor an hole
realm? See what a clenlye sort of tall men he has about him / what costlye
liueries gives he / what a mayny of idle belies daily fedeth he? Has not
Winch. lo / whereof to glory before men? is not this a ioyly iustificacion? Now
follows his conclusion of himself saying / ergo by the gift of god / that is
by these worl dely gifts I may do well before worldly men of flesshly
judgment before I be justified before God / yet justified gloriouslye (in
which I rejoice) before men. This is his Iewisshe iustificacion whereof the
pharisais so highly rejoiced / insomich that christ told Mat. ix
them that he came not to call siche just me^ / but sinner^ to repentance /
warning the people that ex^pte their rightwysnes abounded Mat. v
a boue the pharisais good dedis / they should never come to heaven. And Paul /
says that Romans x
men ignorant of the rightwisnes or rightwisemaking of god / and seking to set
fast (as now does Winch.) their own rightwisnes / they be never subject to the
rightwisnes of god. Winchester yet knows not the office of the law / to show
us our sins / to work wrath / to make sin the more to abound ca. iiij.
and vij.
as Paul proves it to the Romans / so far of must it be to iustifye. Nether
yet knowth he thoffice and proper place of faith nor yet what thing faith is /
but co^ceiueth a certain fantastical opinion thereof as does every spe culatiue
pharisay and idle hypocrite. And a man should speak astir the very order of
nature and of the time / he must nedis set faith before works / as is the tree
before it blometh and the blomes before the fruit. The seade i^ cast into the
earth before it growthe and fr^^tifieth. The sead is the word of God says
Christ. And nighe unto the is the word of Romans x
faith even in thine heart and mouth. Faith Gala. v
is effectuous and works by love. And the end of the precepte is love owte
of a pure i. timo. i
heart (by faith hearts ar made pure says Peter) Act. xv
and a good conscience and of faith vnfai ned. I think Win. is not so ignorant
in his Gramer as to englisshe this text of Paul / Fides que operatur per
^ilectionem / as did John fis^her the bishop of Rochester in his sermon at
Paul's cross and aft^rwarde prin ted / thus englisshed faith which is wrought
by charity: so setti^g the carte before the horse and like an ungodly gardener
to pervert and turn the rotes of his plants and herbs upward / of which I
herd as it were an old prophecye. xl. years agoo that siche an Antichriste
should come to peruerte the iustificacion of faith and turn Christ's religion
vpsedown. I am sewer he wilnot set works before faith / no not in the young
baptized infants / nor yet in Paul at his conversion / nor in the thef hanginge
by christ crucified. It is trweth that works being the fruits of faith
standing in their own place proceeding out of faith justifying / diminish not
theffect of christ's passion. For we are made in christ Jesus to do the good
works which god has Ephesians. ij.
prepared that we should walk in them. We are saved freely by faith says Paul /
yea and that not of works / for it is the gift of god / that we be saved by
faith / and not for our works lest any man should rejoice in his own dedis. But
if winc. put his works in the place and office of faith / as the condition with
out the To. iij.
which noman is justified / so diminishes he yea he is iniuriouse and
blasphemouse unto Isaye xliij ^vi^ lij. lxiij. xlviij.
theffect of christis passion / for by this doctrine his diminute imperf^cte
and wiked works should deserve us forgeuenes of sins as though christ's
blood and so plentuous a redemption in christ were not sufficient. If by the
law says Paul me^ be made rightwyse Gala. ij
/ so is christ ded in vain. Love must fulfill the condition (says he) ergo
the works of the law ar his condition / To. xiij. Now let us see what love
god asks of us / for if we have not that love / we shall never fulfill Win.
condition. God commands us to love Deu. vi
him with owr hole hertes / minds / soulis / and with all owr strength / and
owr neighbors Mat. v Ioa^ xiij Phil. ^^. Romans v
yea and owr enemies to / as owr selves / yea and that even as christ loved us
which died for us being his enymies. He bids us to be perfect and holy as
himself is / not to be so angrye with our brother as to provoke him Mat. v Le.
xix. Exo. ij. Deuteronomy. v To. vij. Mat. x
with any evil word to anger / nor to desire any other ma^s good / servant
wife etc / no not to love our oun liuis in his cause / but to haate our flessh
and dye for his sake. Now tell me Win. if any one man has this love / and so
fulfilled your condition: or else dare yourself affirm to have fulffylled it?
if ye have not / ergo by your own words ye shall never enjoy theffect of
christ's passion (and yet speak I not of the perfect faith and hope that every
man / in god is bownd to have: beware therefore Win. how ye set your salvation
upon so hard a condition / lest ye come to short of the gates shuttinge with
your. v. folisshe virgens. If you had once fulfilled (as you never shall) your
condition / and so perseueringe / you need not to pray / Father forgive me my
dettes / nor never to say your Pater noster. For ye owe no love nether unto
god nor man / ye have paid all. And yet says To. xiij
Paul / owe ye nothing to any man but mutual love / shewinge love to be a
debt ever in paying and never full paid. We shall answer for every idle word
says christ. But Math. xij.
if Win. had accomplisshed his condition / so might he go play and iustle in
judgment with christ for his salvation / having no need of Christis passion /
then might he claim heaven of dewty and make grace no grace / which Romans xi
and. vi.
is a mere free gift undeserved of any man and thus were he one of those just
prelates whom Christ said he came not to call. Is Mat. ix
not he a proud fool to whom when god gives a free iustificacion in christ /
yet will he refuse to take it but upon a condition / that he deserve it with
siche works as himself is ne uer able to perform? what arrogante fool would
thus condition himself agenste gods will? Peter considering this importable
condition Act. xv
said / by faith god purifyeth their her tes / and wherefore the^ do ye now
tempt god somich ^aing siche a vo^^ upon men's necks which nether owr fathers
nor we be able to bear.? By the grace of owr Lord Jesus christ we believe us to
be saved as were owr fathers. i Ioa^. i.
If we should say that we have no sin in us / so ar we liars. Wherefore the
scrip To. iij. and. xi.
turis conclude every man to be a sinner and i^fidele / that of almen God
^oughte have mercy. And that the promise out of faith Gal. iij
in Jesus Christ should be given to the beleuers. Only Christ fulfilled the
law. To. viij the pha risai. ob iection.


And if Win^. would mok out Paul / saying that when he concluded so often man to
be freely justified by faith only withowt the works of the law: that he meant
by the workis of the law but circumcision and the other ce remonies now
abrogated / and not the law of the commandments. Then let him hear Paul
expowning himself of what law he To. iij. and. vij.
meant answering to siche obieccions. By the law says he comes the knowledge
of sin The answers.
and I had not known co^upiscence to have been syn had not the law said: Thou
shall not have any concupiscens or lust. And the^ when he wrote his pistles /
circumcision and the rytes and ceremonies were abrogated among the christen
Jews / and the Gentyles never were bownde to them as was Abraham justified by
faith only ere the law was written and before he was circumcised. And Peter
said that this same law which Paul excludes from iustificacio^ and Wine.
callethe his condition / is a yoke importable which proves it not to be
circumcision nor any of their ceremonies of Moses law / for these were light
enoughe to bear / lyghter and easyer the^ to not lust or desyer any thing
agenst gods will or for a rich man to forsake all and give it to the pore / or
for Win. to cast of his pride his bisshopryke with all his vaynglorye and to
become the humble pore pure persecuted precher of gods word. It is red that
there was one man that by suffering doing ^uke xxiiij
and fulfilling the law of the commandments came to heaven / even christ
only. In Math. we read of a another young man ca. xix.
that would go to heaven by doing some good works / asking christ / Good Master
what deedis shall I do to have life eternal? whose mind christ se^nge / did
set him but certain of the easyest commandments to fill fill them. And he
said / as for these I have done them all redye / well then said Christ or
rather so thought / If ye will nedis go to heaven by doing / I shall set you to
do siche deedis as I know well ye will never do / yea they be impossible for
you to do them / even to sell his substance and to give it to the pore and so
to follow him now going forth to Jerusalem to suffer death. What did this man I
pray you? how far went he with christ think you? went he not his way heavy
ly from christ? And yet will Win* go to heaven by doing and fulfilling his
hard condition / I dare say he would s^ratche his head twyse (as did this rich
man) ere he sold his bisshopryke and had given it to the pore. And therefore
Christ pronownced that it is impossible Math. xix
for siche rich men to come to heaven. God therefore trusted us so little with
the full Mar. x
fillinge of the law and so by this condition to come to heaven / that he took
it out of owr hands and laid it upon his son crysts bake to be fulfilled.
For if he had left our salvation in owr own hands to be deserved by owr works
we had been all dampened. Yet say on Winchester once agene.

Ergo I may do well by the gift win^. v. article.
of god before I am justified toward the ataynement of iustificacio^.
Now declares he by his well doing for the Georg Joy.
ataynment of his iustificacion to be justified by works. Here is his condiciou
declared to be works. Here he shows himself to be arr^gantlye bolder then
David or just Job / which both feared their works and desyered god not to
enter into judgment with the^ for the^ should there noman be justified in his
fight / and again says David / lord if thou shuldst observe owr iniquities /

faith and charity.
Faith only (says Christ and Paul) is required to thatainme^t of the
iustificacio^ which Georg Joy.
is of God / nether is charity excluded from faith but from the efficacye
effect and office to iustifye. For to this effect and office is faith alone
sufficient effectuously. As from fire or from the son we exclude not heat
nor brightness / but yet have heat and brightness their sundry effects and
offices: for the heat warmethe and with his bryghtnes the sone shyneth and
gives light. Charity has many fayer effects and offices attributed only ^.

unto herself as proper / and is highly com mended for the^ / as is faith
extolled of Paul for her offices in the Hebrews. And I dare Hebrr xi
say / charity is content with her own works / called benign pacient etc /
so that she de syereth not to put her elder sister faith out of her chief
office nor yet to usurp any part thereof / whose office principal is alone to
iustifye / but and if Win. will defraude faith of her effect and imparte it
unto charity / he shall offend both charity and faith. This is certain that
if charity had had any siche an excellent effect and office as to justify /
Paul would not have omitted it / but would have ge uen her the glory thereof
setting it forth before all saying / Charity iustifyeth / charity is i. co. xiij
benign / pacient etc. I would Winc. would once show us where he fyndeth this
text in scripture. Charity iustifyeth. It is written in many places faith
iustifyeth / by faith God Hebr. xi

through the raunsom and redemption made by the anointed savior whom god the

thereupon to be apeased through faith in his blood / setforthe (I say) to
declare himself faithful and trwe of his promise concerning the forgeuenes of
sins hitherto committed and paste / which sinne^ god the father had not ano^
punisshed but pacie^tly suffered them to declare his long sufferinge and
himself to be trwe of his promise at this present time when himself would be
known and declared faithful and just in that he justifies who soever believes
and li ueth in Jesus by faith. Where is the^ now thy gloriouse hostinge oh Win.?
It is plainly excluded and shut out of doors. By what reason? by the reason
and vertew of works? N^ no / but by the reason of faith. We conclude therefore
(says Paul) that by faith a man is justified with out the works of the law.
^o here is all gloriacion of works blown down laid flat in the duste by the
reason and power of faith: for as faith humbles and geuethe all glory to god /
so do works puff up man and ascribe glory unto men. If theffect of christ's
passion should depend of the condition of our works / we should never be sewer
and certain of our iustificacion / for all our works ar imperfect Isaye lxiij.
and foul as the sike womans clothes. Paul himself did his office so trwly

Yet dare not he express his condition / saying Georg Joy.
plainly. Faith assewereth me of the promise of god (if I fulfill the law) but
Win. nor none else / but only christ / fulfilled the law ergo nether Winch.
nor any else / standinge this condition / shall never be assewered of the promise
of God. Paul argeweth another ways excludinge the condition that men might be
the sewerer and certayner of the promise. For if the promise should stand of an
uncertain / yea impossible condition: who shall be certain and assewered of the
promise? Thus argeweth Paul. By the works of ^io. iiji.
the law came not the promise to Abraham or to his fead / him to be thayer of
the world but by the rightwisemaking by faith. For if they that will be
justified by the works be therefore made thayers / so is faith and believe in
vain and the promise void and frustrate. For the law works but wrath /
ergo it works no good works to the ataynment of iustificacion. It works
wrath for that it is impossible to be performed and accomplished of man which
is flesh as Paul ^io. viij
constantly affirms / and therefore it wrappethe all the workers thereof to be
justified thereby / under the curse. For as many as stand upon the works of the
law to this end even for their iustificacio^ ar yoked under ex ecracion and
tied to the curse Gala. iij. For where i^ no law there is no transgression.
Wherefore (Paul now concludes agenste Win. saying) out of faith is the
heretage ge uen / like as out of grace / that the promise might be the more
fernie and sewerer unto all the sead / not to it that is only out of the law
/ but also to it which is out of the faith of Abraham. Paul in spirit did see
before this Winchesters condition to frustate the promise and therefore he
confuteth it here so cle rely. And again unto the Galathe^s / If any Gal. iij
would obiecte saying / ergo the law is age^ste the promises. God forbid says
Paul / but if there had been a law given which might have given life / then no
doubt iustificacion might have come^ by the law. But the scrip ture concluded
all under syn that the promise / the promise (I say) out of the faith of Ie su
Christ should be given and not deserved to the beleuers. Thus ye see how with
so many words paul excludes Win. impossible condition / to make fast the
promise in Christ that owr faith might be the sewerer stayede and cleave to
it. If only unbelief dampneth / why should not only faith iustifye? it is
a good argument of contrary. But yet because Win. wyndeth in his condition so
hard for the atainmente of his iustificacion by works. I would feign se some
one of his good works so perfect / pure / with out any carnal affecte annexed
/ either of vaynglory or of love to himself or for fere of pain not done nor
for hope of reward / or any lucre promocion or to recen^e a beter thing for
the doing thereof / out of so pure an heart that it be not done of any
affeccion to the person / but only of faith and ^ele for the glory of god
and profit of his neighbor or only to mortifye his own affectes and to set
naught by himself / to abnegate and re nownce his estimacion and glory / to be
renewed in spirit and to follow christ mekely to death. Paul acknowlegeth
himself and com ^o. vij.
playueth in his most perfeccion not to be able to do that good which he would
do / but to do that evil which he would not do. ^e dirst not call in / this
condition to atayne his iusti ficacion thereby / but constantlye affirmed as
many as stand upon the works of the law to fulfill them / thereby to be
justified / ar yoked unto the curse of the law saying / Cursed is every man
that abides not in althingis wryte^ in the book of the law to perform them.
I wonder therefore that Win. dare stand upon his condition to be fulfilled to
ataine any part of his iustificacion thereby. Dare he claim (think ye) any
part of his iustificacion for burning of Doctor Garnis and his felows for
prechinge agenst these wikekly armed articles? Tell us Win. did thou burn
them so cruelly of love and not of haatred or envy? trwely love burns noman
for preching the trweth / charity enuyeth not etc^. Abi igitur post christum
satana / Math: xvi.
Come bak devil aftir christ / thou art sclau^ derous to his cross / for
being married to thy nown wit / thou sauourst not the heavenly and godly
iustificacion / but siche one as natural reason persuades among men / even
one good turn for another to be done / and so to deserve thy iustificacio^.
But be it in case / that Win. thus condicioninge with God has in his own
opinion done some good dee de whereby he dare claym his iustificacio^ / yet shall
not that same deed serve him to that einmente of that effect. For were it
never so good / yet does his false opinion in his deed make it dampnable. But
let us speak of a good deed absolutely / excluded from all carnal affectes
(if any man may do siche one) this deed is not owre deed / but the deed of
god working it in us / for what deed soever procedethe owte of owr corrupt
nature is naught. It is god says Paul that workethe Phil. ij
in you according to his good mind both to will well / and also to perform
your work. Nether ar we apt and able to think somiche ij. co. iij
as a good thought out of owr own selves / but all our ablenes comes from
God. And I say says / lord s^t peace among us / I say xxvi.
for it is thou that workest and finisshest all thing is in us both our
thought is and de^des. And therefore well said Austen. God crowns in us his
own deedis and not owrs. Con dicio^ not therefore (Win.) with god for your
deedis / which (as all me^ see them) ar but ^a lice / mischief / envy / rankor
/ bitterness / blood thirstinge / pride / cruel tyranny / blasphemies /
persecucion of christis innocente lombes and of his word / deceytfully

persuasion as Paul says / asseweringe you of your iustificacio^ / why the^
add you yowr uncertain condition wavering upon your sinful works which as
they be unstable imperfect and sin so can they never make you a quiet and
tranquil conscience / nor certifye you of your iustificacion / God so saying
/ Thou laborest in the multitud of thy nown Isa. lv^
ways and yet thoughtest thou them never enoughe. Add no condition on your
behalf therefore (oh Win.) into your own condemp nation. Christ never taught
you to believe upon a condition / but said simply and plainly / Believe and thou
art saved. Add not Proue^ xxx.
to gods word / lest ye be condemned far a liar. Winch. told Martyn Bucere
that he and his would not receive the doctors as Win. would / I could bring
Austen Hierom Origene and many other autentyk writers agenst himself / but let
us see whethir he will believe this one doctor saint Ambrose / thus writing upon
the first pistle to the Corinthes saying. This thing is co^stituted of god that
whosoever believe in criste he is saved / with out any work / only by faith / freely
receiui^g the remission of his sins. What can be spo ken more plainly? Now
make an end win. and conclude your arrogant articles.

A man being in dedly syn / may have Win. ^ article.
grace to do the works of penance whereby he may atayne to his iustificacion.
And I say the contrary. That a man bei^ge Georg Joy.
in dedlye sin may have no grace to do the works of penance / as I fear me
it will be verifyed of Win. himself. But the lord co^ uerte him once so that
all men may see his open fruits of repentance for his greuouse persecucion of
Christ's members and hear him openly with tears recantinge his false doctryn
whereby he has seduced many a sim ple soul. This is lo / his doctrine / A man
must do the works of penance before he be justified and so by siche works
merit and deserve his iustificacion and forgeuenes of sins. Here thou see
(christen reader) that siche a man has no need of christ's death / but for
siche men (says paul) christ is dead Gala. ij
in vain.

Thus ye see the conclusion of his articles to be / That he may do well before
he be iusti fied. But (as I said before) it behowuethe a learned divine to
conclude what ought to be done / and what god willith to be believed by his
manifest word / and not what Winch. may do by his own blind reasoninge with
out gods word. He may do well by the gift of god (says he) which is faith /
ergo his faith goth before his well doing and his iustifica cion / and his good
works must be thrust betwixt both (if the* place be not to narow for them) so
that he having his faith and his good works / is not as yet justified nether by
his faith nor by his good works / for they must serve him but toward the
atainmente to his iustificacion. Paul and Christ / joined faith and
iustificacion ever inseparably together: but this scismatyk iewisshe Hieroboam*
deuillishe diuider of all christian unite will thrust his good works betwixt them
/ not suffering faith to cleaueto immediately herown obiecte / even the mercy of
god promising remission of sins in christ's death. He would thrust in here the
works of penance before iustificacion / which thing how folisshe it is ye shall
see. First / ye know that penance must go before her works as is the tree
before her fruits. Penance is a turning to god / whereby Pena^c^
of the sincere fear of god a man humbled acknowlegeth his sin / and ^o all
his whole life he makes new. Who turns to god / but he first believe and
knowth god for christ's sake to be so merciful unto him that at his turninge
to him he receiuethe him and forgeueth him his sins? which faith and knowledge
what else is it then his iustificacio^ / god the father so affirminge it in his
prophet Isaye saying. In the knowledge of him / this cap. liij.
eue^ my servant shall justify many. Here ye see that this knowledge and faith
iustifyeth before the works of penance ar done. For God is known in christ
ere we turn to him of the which turninge to god there follow the fruits of
repentance in doing them all owr life long / as to fear god / to humble owr
self / to confess our sins to him and to renew owr lives mortifyinge
continuallye owr flesh.

Now let us see the order of owr iustifica cion before god according to the
scriptures. First (says Paul) we are chosen of God in Ephe. i Eleccio^

sufficient / merciful / benign / loving / almighty to me / my deliverer

this knowledge and bel^if he calls all his chose^: To. vi^^ and.i. Psam. xviij.
for whom he has forse^e predestined and cho sen / them has he called by
his word and creacion of this world unto this faith and knowledge / ^^ whom he
thus called / the same has he justified / and who^ he has justified them
^ath he gloryfied. Thus we elect called and renated of the spirit know the
fathir in christ and we know christ by the father which knowledge and faith
draws us to love god and to keep his precepts gladlye. Thus to ^o. xvij
know the father in christ and christ in him is life eternal. Out of this
ple^tuous knowledge justifying us as I say says springethe repentance for here
the sinner prays god to convert him saying with Ieremye / lord convert me
and I shall be converted / for thou lord art my God / wherefore as sone Ierem.
^^^^.
as thou shall convert me I shall repent me and anon as thou make me to
know my sins I shall smite my hand upon my hippe. Now tell us / Win. / who
is the author of re pentance* or is repentance before faith iustifyinge or no*
There is no man having this knowledge and faith in God through christ but he
will ano^ with the publica^e falldowne smyting his hand upon his breast say^g
lord have mercy upon me a sinner. In this knowledge we see owr sins buried in
christ's wowndes / and no more in the stonney tables for anger cast of that
most mylde Mo ses agenst the grownde altobroke^. We fel^ them by owr faith
forgiven in christ's death and owrselues justified by his resurreccion / our
hertes set at peace and rest with god in christ dead for owr sins and risen
agene for our iustificacion. Which merciable goodness whosoever beholds in christ
crucified / he can not but of love unto god in christ lament and be heuye in
heart that ever he should commit siche grievous sins which could not be
forgiven without the blood shedi^ge of that most innocent and immaculate lombe
sufferinge for his enemies / which love as it is unspeakable / so is it
incomparable. A man (says Paul) To. v.
will s^ante dye willingly when he must nedis and justly dye / but perchance
will put himself in perell of death for his goods to be saved / or the
mother to save her child etc. But god / he commends his love towerd us / in
that when we were sinners criste would dye for us / miche more therefore now we
being justified in his blood / shall be preserved by him from wrath. What
faithful heart towched with this incomparable love out of faith and knowledge /
is not humbled with fear and confession of his sins to god / and is not heuye
and repentante detesting his sins saying? Shall I any more commit that thing
which has brought this my so loving a savior to so shameful and painful a
passion? This is our faith which cleaneth te the most certain promise of god /
and not to Win. wavering ^o. iiij.
unstable condition. This is owr faith and substancial certitude the most f^rme
per swasion / without any wavering / of the mer ciable free fogeuenes and
gracious absoluci on of our sins by the promise of our fathir celestial in
christ's blood: and has her own proper correllatiue the promise of god ever
correspondent / and not Winchesters know lege of the fulfulfilling of his
co^dicio^. This is the form of owr iustificacio^ by faith only which
attributes all glory to god as did Abraham and his childerne and as many as
have unfeignedly received christ's gospel. But let win* work on still his
wyked works unto that tainment of his pharisaical iustificacion before men
until the axe now bent unto his rotis / he be suddenly smytendowne of god. For
Passur must be turned (as Ier^ Ier^. xx
mye says) into Pauor / his arrogante vpcliminge and extolling of himself
above god must have a shameful soden fearful fall. These arrroga^t articles /
may be well called the false articles of Winchesters false faith / and not of
christ's faith. For Christ co^fir^ed his articles evermore with the law and
phetes / but Winch. brings not one word of god for him to prove his.
Wherefore let them be his own articles armed with his own proud autorite.
For we may not believe him thus exaltinge himself above christ^ which ever
alleged the scriptures for his doctrine to be confirmed / we may not believe my
lord Vicare general for his high lordly supcilious pharisaical lookis.
Wherefore if this Gardener will seem to be learned let him answer now with gods
word and not dispute with pore me^ in his fetters and presons with his
finnisshe threatis fyery fagettes presoning and persecutinge the pore innocont
members of christ for weldoing / purely freely and faithfully preaching gods
word / casting of his blodhowndes into eve ry city and town to hunte out
the christian simple sely flock^ of christ / as he of late made William Castelyn
Gouerner of the mer chaunt aduenterers at Anwerpe / chiefly to h^^te out siche
as purely and frelye wryts and set forth books unto the glory of god edifying
of christ's church and to warn men of Win. false doctrine. For this Gouerne^
of other men / which could never well govern himself / is more meat to
row in a galey or to hold the plough the^ to govern so worshiple and honest
a company. But the lord^is a live and hears of these Mo Ierem. xlviij.
abites pride and blood thirsting / he sees their secret wiked counsels and
hears their bosting proud crackes / their supercilious arrogancye is well
known unto me says the lord: but yet for all their lucifery^e pride
promotinge and extollinge themselves and one an other to serve their
traitourouse turns and mutual mischief / yet shall they never bring about
their wiked enforceme^ts. For it is God that deposes siche mighty^ ^uke.i
mischeuouse from their seats and exaltethe the humble / It is the lord that
skaterethe their wiked counsels and trappeth them in their own pride and blody
cogitacio^s. But let all christen Kings and Princes beware how they geu^ their
sword into siche popisshe prelates hands lest the innocent blood be required
of god at their handis / to whom be praise for ever Amen.

Trwthe it is / that he which knows nether the father nor christ shall never
believe Christ to be an hole perfect and sufficient savior and forgeuer of
sins / but he shall wind in this crooked condition of Winc. and divide his
iustificacio^ part (if he geu^ not all) to works / and part to god / as did
the Jews and now the Turks and siche like heithen miscreaunts which never
knew god the fa there in / and by Christ. Yea they shall devise and imagyn in
their own opinions (for trwe faith have they none) siche works for gods honor
as themselves think to make most for a great Kings honor / as to be
accompanied with many men and fetched in with many torches and candels at none
day ligh ted to him / which is the very light it self / These blind
worshipers will make god an image thereby to worship him / which idollatrye the
second commandment utterly for bids. They will worship him with gold /
perle / precious stones veluete clothe of gold etc. They sense singe and ring
him in with belles as they were wont to do the bisshops. They pype him up with
orgaynes / and all the costly pleasant externe rytes and ceremonies as sencings
processions that can be devised for to please great me^* they use the same to
worship god with all / when Christ said God my father is a spirit and in
spirit and Ioa^. iiij*
trweth will he be worshipped. Yea these worl delye wyked blind Bisshops ar so
far cast away and for their wikednes turned up of god into theirowne hertes
lusts / and into a reprobate da^p^ed mind that they know not god fro man
mortal. Oh good god what mind may this be. Verily Paul expresses ^om. i.
it and the cause why god worthelye thus casteche them up / saying. Whatsoever
men ought to know of god / the same has god showed them / as his almighty
power and godhed: yea and that by the creacion and creatures of the world if
they would diligently and humbly look upon and expend them / so that they be
without excuse of any ignorance. But when God had given Winche. this knowledge
of him / the^ yet he worshipped nor glorified him not as god / but as he would
worship any other worldly prince with owtward^ rytes and ceremonies / nether
does he give him thanks / but shows his own vayn curiosite and curiouse
vainite in his own reasoninge and disputinge for gods most gloriouse honor /
in somiche that he has now blindened his own ignorant heart / and wherein he
thought to have done most wiselye for gods worship and glory / there does he
most folislye and cruellye / shewinge himself a very fool (as Paul says)
turninge up the worship of god incorruptible through his own imaginacions to
worship him aftir his own fond devises. And for this cau se has God thus
cast him up through his own hertes lustis into almauer prodigiouse and
beas^lye fylthines receiving into him self the worthey reward of his own
error. And forbecause (says Paul) he does set at naught so present
knowledge of god now opened unto him and to all other that will embrace Christ
and his word / therefore does God turn him up into this detesta ble opinion of
his own false iustificacion ^ into so lothelye and abominable reprobate
bloudye mind / that in presoninge / persecu tinge / faget^ing / burninge and
staying the trwe professors and prechers of gods holy Io. xvi.
word / he shall (as Christ says) seem to him self and siche like to do god
high worship and by the fulfillinge of siche wyked works even his own
condition / to atayne to his own iustificacion before the devil the prince of
this world / his antichriste^ Pope of Rome / Cardinals / preistes etc / whose
vicare general worthelye and iustlye he yet plays up and down. And all this
(says Christ) shall this vicare general do to you because he know the
nether my father nor ^ne. This is that reprobate mind into which this
Gardener is now turned up of god which dampened mind he declares saying. Woo
be to them that say that thing to be Isay. v*
evil which they know to be good / and that to be good which they know to be
evil. The Lord preserve his chirch from siche a vicare general. Christ keep
every Diocese from sith a Bishop. The holy Ghost teache all christen Princes
to beware of siche a cownseller.

So be it.
Alexander Macedonis sentence is this saying. I must needs haate that
Gardener and herb seller which plucketh up his herbs by the roots. The axe
therefore is be^te to his root says John Bapt. He is cutdowne and cast into
the fire / except he repent.
