The apologye of sir Thomas More knight.

Sir Thomas More knight to the christian reders.
The first chapyter.
SO well stand I not (I thank god) good reader in mine own conceyte, and
thereby so myche in mine own light, but that I can somewhat with egall
judgment and an even yie, byholde and consider both my self and mine own.
Nor I use not to follow the condycion of Isopes ape, y^ thought her own babes
so b^utuouse, and so far passing in all goodly feature and favor / nor the
crow that accounted her own birds the fairest of all the fowls that flew. But
like as some (I se well) there are, that can somewhat less the^ I, that yet for
all that put out their works in writing: so am I not so blind upon the
the other side, but that I very well perceive, very many so far in wit and
erudicyon above me, that in such matter as I have any thing written, if other
men, as many would have take yt in hand as could have done yt better, yt might
myche better have become^ me to let the matter alone, then by writing to p^sume
any thing to meddle therwyth.

And therefore good reader, sith I so well know so many me^ so far excel and
pass me, in all such things as are required in him that might adventure to
put his works abroad, to stand and abide the judgment of all other men: I was
never so far ouer^^ne, as either to look or hope that ^^ch fautes as in my
writing should by mine ouersyght escape me, could (...) the (...) of all other
men (...) forth vnspyed / but (...) both by (...) percey^^d / (...) amo^^ so
many ^adde bre^^erne as I wy^^ well would be ^^^oth with th^^, should be both
sought out and syfted to the vtte^most flake of branne, and largely theruppon
controlled and reproved.

But yet against all this ^eare this one thing recomforted me, that sith I
was of one point very fast and sure, that such things as I w^yte are
consonaunt unto the comen catholyque faith and determynacyons of Christ's
catholyque church, and are clear confutacions of false blasphemouse heresies by
Tyndale and Barons pu^ forth unto the contrary / any great fault and
intoll^rab^e should they none find, of such manner sort and kind as y^ re^ders
should in their souls peryshe and be destroyed by / of which poysened fautes
mine aduersa^yes books be full.

Now then as for other fautes of less w^yght and tolerable / I nothing douted
nor do, but that every good christen reader will be so reasonable and
indyfferent, as to pardon in me the thing that happeth in all other me^ / and
that no such man will over me be so sore an audytour, and over my books such
a sore controller, as to charge me with any great loss, by gatherynge to
gether of many such things as are with very few men aughte regarded / and to
look for such exa^te cyrcumspeccy on and sure sight to be by me used in my
writing, as except the prophetis of god, and Christ and his apostles, has
never I wene be founden in any man's else before / that is to wit to be
perfyte in every point clean from all manner of fautes / but has always ^en
holden for a thing excusable, though the reader in a long work perceive that
the wry^er have as Horace says of Homere, here and there some time f^llen in a
little slomber / in which places as the reader sees that the writer slept, so
uses he of courtesy if he can not sleep, yet for company at the least wise to
nappe and wynke with him, and leave his dreme vnchekked. which kind of
courtesy if I should show how often I have used with Tyndale and Barons both,
wynkynge at their tolerable fautes, and such as I rather thought neglygently
escaped them of ouersyght or folly, then dylygently devised of wyly falsed or
malice: y^ I would add all those fautes to their other, then should I double
in length all my books, in which the brethren find for the special fault,
that they be to long all ready.

But all be it that when I wrote I was (as I have told you) bolded and
encoraged by the common custume of all indyffere^t readers, which would I wist
well perdo^ and hold excused such tolerable ouersyght in my writing, as men
may find some in any mannys all most that ever wrote before: yet am I now
myche more glad and bold, when I se y^ those folk which would faynest find
my fawtes, can not yet happen on them / but after long seeking and searching
for them, for all their bysynesse taken there about, are feign to put for
fawtes in my writing, such things as well considered shall appear their own
fawtes for the finding.

For they find first for a great fawte, that my writing is over long, and
therefore to tedyouse to read. For which cause they say they will never
onsvouchsaufe to look thero^.

But than say they ferther, that such places of them as are looked on by those
that are learned and can skyll, be soon perceived for naught, and my reasons of
little force. For they bost much that they here sometime diverse parts of my
books answered and co^futedfully in sundry of some men's sermons, though my
name be forborne / and than they wysshe me there they say, for that it would
do their hearts good to se my chekes read for shame.

And over this they find a great fawte, that I handle Tyndale and Barons
their two new gospellers, with no fayrer words nor in no more courteyse manner.

And over this I write they say in such wise, that I show my self suspecte in
the matter and parciall toward the clergy.

And than they say that my wurkes were wurthy myche more credence, if I had
written more indyfferentely, and had declared and made open to the people the
fawtes of the clergy.

And in this point they lay for a sample the goodly and godly mylde and g^ntle
fashyon used by him who so ever he was, that now lately wrote y^ book of the
deuisyon between the temporaltye and the spy^ytualty / which charytable mylde
manner they say that y^ I had used, my wurkes would have been read both of many
mo, and with much better will.

And yet they say bysydes ^ll this, that I do but pyke out pyeces at my
pleasure, such as I may mo^te easily ^eme to soil / and leave out what me
list, and such as would plainly prove the matter against me. And so they
say that I use but craft and fraud against Tyndale. For as for ^rere Barons
I perceive by sundry ways, that the bretherhed ^peke myche less of him,
either for that they find him in their own minds well and fully answered, or
else y^ they take him in respec^ of Tindale but for a man of a secunde sor^e.
And that may^ peradventure be, because he leueth out ^omwhat that Tindale
takes in, that is to wy^ the making of mockes and mowys against the mass,
and the blessed sacrament of the altar.

But finally they ^aye ferther yet, that I have not fulfilled my promise. For I
promised they say in my preface of my confutacyon, y^ I would prove the church
/ and that they say I have not done.

The second chapter.
Now will I begin with that point that I most esteem. For of all the remanau^t
make I little count. But surely loath would I be to miss rehearse any mannys
reason against whom I write, or to rehearse him slenderly. And in that point
undoubtedly they se full well them self, that they say not true. For there is
no reason that I rehearse of Tyndales or of friar Barns either, but that I use
the contrary manner therein that Tyndale uses with mine. For he reherseth mine
in every place faintly and falsely to / and leueth out the pyth and the
strength, and the proof that most makes for the purpose. And he fares
therein, as if ^here were one that having day of challenge appointed, in which
he should wrestle with his adversary, would find the mean by craft to get his
adversary before the day into his own hands, and there keep him and diet him
with such a thynne diete, that at the day he bry^geth him forth feeble, faynte,
and famyshed, and all most hunger storuen, and so lene that he can scant stand
on his legs / and then is yt etheye wot well to give the sely soul a fall.
And yet when Tyndale has done all this, he takes the fall him self.

But every man may well se, that I never use that way with Tyndale nor with
any of these folk / but I rehearse their reason to the best that they can make
yt them self / and ^ rather enforce yt and st^ength it of mine own, th^n take
any part of theyrs there from.

And this use I not only in such places as I do not rehearse all their own
words (for that is not requy^y^e in every place) but I use yt also in such
places ^esyde, as of ^ll the^r own words I leave not one syllable out. For
such darkness use they purposely, and Tyndale in especyall, that ^xcepte I took
some payn^ to set out their agume^tes plainly many that read them should ly^le
wit what they mean.

And to thente^t every man may se y^ these good brethren little care how loud
they lie: let any man look who so will / and he shall find, that of friar Barons
I have left out little, except a lefe or two concerning the general counsayles,
and I show the cause why / and as for Tindale of diverse whole chapyters of
his, I have not wyttyngly left out one line / and very few I am sure of over
sight either, but have put in all his chapiters whole, wheruppon any weight of
his matter hangs, except only in the defense of such englysh words as he
has changed in his translacion of the new testament. And yet therein they ca^
never say, but that I have put in all the strength and pith of his proof.

But all the remanaunt of his chapyters, as far as I have goone have I put
in whole, leuynge out naught but raylynge and preaching without proof / and
that but in one place or twain / and where I so do, I give the reader warning.

Now that his chapyters be whole rehearsed in my book, I suppose yt may metely
well appear by the matter co^seque^tly pursuyng, if the reader leave my words
out between, and ^ede but Tyndales alone. Or if any one word or some few left
out of chance put that proof in doubt / yet have the brethern among them I
warrau^t you of Tyndales books enough, by which they may try this true.

And well ye wot if this were untrue that I say, some of the^ could assign at
the lest wise some one such place for a sample. But that thing neither do
they, nor never can while they live.

The third chapyter
Now where ^s these good blessed brethren say, y^ my writing is so long and
so tedyouse, that they will not ones vouchsaufe to look thereon / they show the^
self that my writing is not so long as their wits be short / and the yien
of their souls very poor blind, while they can not se so far, as to
perceive that in finding so many fautes in that book, which they confess the^
self they neither read nor can find in their heart to look upon, they show
them self either of lyghtnes ready to give hasty credence to other folk, or
of malice to make many lies them self.

It is little marvel that yt seem long and tedyouse unto them to read yt over
with in, whom yt irketh to do so myche as look yt over without / and every way
seems long to him that is weary ere he begin.

But I find some men again, to whom the redynge is so far fro ^edyouse,
that they have read the hole bok^ over thryes / and some that make tables
thereof for their own remembrance / and that such men as have as myche wit
and learning both, as the best of all this blessed bretherhed that ever I herd
of.

Now be it glad would I have been if it might hau^ ben much more short /
for tha^ should my labor have been so much the less.

But they will if they be reasonable men, consider in them self that it is a
shorter thing and sooner done to write heres^^s than to answer them.

For the most folly she heretyke in a town, may write mo falls heresies in one
lefe, than the wysest man in the hole world can well and co^uenyently by reason
and authoryte soil and confute in fourtye.

Now when that Tyndale not only techeth false heresies, but furnysheth his
er^ours also with pretense of reasone and scripture / and instead of reason
sometime with blont subtyltyes and rude ridyls, to the making open and
lyghtesome to the reader, the dark writing of him that would not by his will
be well perceived, has put me to more labor and length in enswerynge,
than some man would peradventure have been content to take.

And I sometime take the pain to rehearse some one thing in diverse fasshyons
in mo places tha^ one, because I wo^de that the reder should in every place
where he fortuneth to fall in redynge, have at his hand without remyttynge over
else where, or labor of ferther sekyng for it, as much as shall seem
requysyte for y^ matter that he there has in hand. And therein the labor of
all that length is mine own, for ease and shortenynge of the readers pain.

Now on the other side, as for Tyndale and Barns, I wot nere well whether I
may call them long or short.

For sometime they be short in deed, because they would be dark, and have their
false fo lies pass and repasse all vnperceyued.

Some time they can use such a compendyouse kind of cloque^ce, that they
convey and couche up to gether, with a wonderful breuyte, four fo lies and
five lies in less then as many lines.

But yet for all this, I se not in effec^ any me^ more long then they. For they
preach some time a long procesle to very little purpose. And sith that of all
their whole purpose, they prove in co^clusyon never a pyece at al, were their
writing never so short / yet were their (...) work at (...) to long by all
to gether.

But greatly can I not marvel, though these evangelical brethern think my
works to long. For every thing think they to long that ought is.

Our ladies psalter think they to long by all the Aue Maryes / and some good
pyece of the Creed to.

Then the mass thynk they to long by the secrets, and the canon, and all the
colectis wherein mencyon is made either of saints or souls.

Instead of a long portuouse, a short prymer shall serve them. And yet the
prymer they think to long by all our lady matens.

And the seven Psalms think they long enough with out the lateny.

And as for Dyryge or co^mendacyon for their friends souls, all that service
they think to long by all to gether.

But now good readers, I have unto these delycat daynty folk that can away
with no long redynge, provided with mine own pain and labor, as myche ease
as my poor wit could deuyse.

Fyrs^e when they were before fast in the catholyque faith* they never neded
to have read any of these here tiques books, y^ have brought them in to these
new fangled fantasyes. But now sith they be by their own folly, fallen first
into doutynge of the troth, and afterward into the lenyng to ward a false by
lyefe / they be very neglygent and unreasonable, if they will not at the least
wise for their own suerty, search and se somewhat, whereby they may per ceyue
whyther these new tea chers of theyres be such as they take them for.

Now have I then co^sydered, y^ they would peradventure ware weary to read over a
long book / and therefore have I taken the more pain upon every chapyter, to
thentent that they shall not need to read over any chapyter but one, and that yt
shall not force greatly which one through out all the book.

For I dare be hold to say, and am ready to make yt good with the best
eua^gelyst of all this euangely call bretherhed that will set his pen to the
contrary, y^ there is not one chapyter of Tyndales or Barns either, that I have
touched through mine whole work, but that I have so clear and so fully
confuted him, that who so read yt indyfferently, may well and clearly se that
they handle their matter so falsely, and yet so folyshely therwyth, that no man
which regards either troth or wit, should ones vouchesaufe to read any
farther of them

Now he that will therefore read any one chapyter, either at adventure, or else
some chosen pyece in which him self had went that his euangelycall father
Tyndale had said wonderful well, or else friar Barns either / when he shall in
that one chapyter as I am sure he shall, find his holy prophet plainly
proved a fool, he may be soon eased of any ferther labor. For than has he
good cause to cast him quyte of, and never meddle more with him / and tha^
shall he never need to read more of my book neither, and so shall he make it
short enough.

How be it if he list for all that to perdon his prophet in that one place,
and think that he wrote that pyece peradventure while the spyryte was not upon
him, and that he says much better in some other place, and so will read on
ferther to find it: than shall him self make my work long. For he shall I
trust read it over, and yet shall he never come to it. And thus as for the
tedyouse length of my wry^ynge, I have I trust without great length given the
good bretherhed a suffycyent answer.

The.iiii. chapyter.
BUt now will the brethren peradventure say, that I may be bold to say very
largely of mine own, because men may not be bold in these matters to defend.
Tindals part.

It were in deed somewhat better then it is if they said true. But neither are
such things so dylygentely controlled, nor such folk so ^erd of such
heretycall favor, as they should be if every man did his part / nor they lack
no wyly dryftes in such wise also to defend those things, as they may save for
the^ self some color to say that they meant none harm.

And to prove that they be neither so sore aferde in such things, nor lack
such inuencions of vtterynge their forbode^ ware, bysyde the bold erronyous
talking that is now all most in every lewd laddys mouth / the brethren bost
that they here diverse parts of my book well and plainly in sundry of their
sermons confuted / and than they can not say ye se well that they leave me
unanswered for fere.

How be it though they be bold upon some parts even now / some parts
happily there are whereupon they dare not be so bold yet, but little and little
will peradventure hereafter.

How be yt some parts that they be all ready bold upon, be metely well for a
begynny^ge / whereof for ensample I shall remember you one or twain.

Tyndales false translacion of the new testament was (as ye wo^e well and as
him self confesses) trranslated with such chaunges as he has made therein
purposely, to the intent that by those words changed, the people should be
noseled in those opinions which him self calls true catholyque faith, and
which things all true catholyque people call very false pestyle^t heresies.

This translacion therefore being by the clergy condemned, and at Poules
cross openly burned, and by the kings graciouse proclamacyo^ openly forbode^:
I wrote in a place of my dyaloge in y^.C. lefe among other things these words.

The fautes be so many in Tyndal^ translacyon of the new testament / and so
spread thorough the hose book / that like wrse as it were as sone done to weue a
new web of cloth, as to so we up every hole in a net / so were it almost as
little labor and less, to translate the hole book all new / as to make in
his translacyon so many chaunges as need must be ere it were made good /
bes^des this that there would no wise man I trow take the bread which he well
wyste was of his enemies hand onys poisoned / though he saw his friend after
scrape it never so clean.

These words of mine were rehearsed in a sermon, and answered in this wise, y^
though there were bread that were poisoned in deed, yet were poysened bread
better then no bread at all.

Now was this word taken up, and walked about abroad among the brethren and
systerne, so hyghly well lyked among them, that some of the^ said that all my
reasons were avoided clean with that one word.

Now be it in deed one of their own wives yet told her own husband at home,
when she hard him boste yt, how iolyly yt was preached better poysened bread
then no bread / by our laken brother husband quod she, but as properly as that
was preched, yet would I rather abide the perell of bredynge worms in my belly
by eating of flesh without bread, then to eat with my meat the bread y^ I
wyste well were poisoned.

And of troth good reader, this word of his was one of the most proud and
presumptuouse, and therewyth the most unwise to, that ever I hard pass the
mouth of any man reputed and taken for wise.

For when the thing had been examyned, considered, and condemned, by such as
the judgment and the orderyng of the thing did apperteyne unto, that false
poysened tra^slacyon was forboden the people / it was an heyghnouse presumpcyon
of one man, upon the trust of his own wit, to give the people courage and
boldness to resyste their prince and disobey their prelates, and give the^
no better staff to stand by, then such a bald poisoned reason, that poysened
bread is better the^^ no bread.

For ^yrste I pray you how pr^ueth ^e that poysened bred were better then no
bread. I would wene yt were as good to forbere meat and starve for hunger, as
to eat rat^is bane and dye by poison / but if the precher pro^e me that it
were better for a man to kill him self then dye.

But now falls he in double folly / for first his proper wise word can have
no wit therein, but if he prove that y^ people must needs perish for lack of
spyrytuall food, e^cepte the scripture be translated into their own tongue.

Now if he say and afferme that / then every fool almost may feel the mannys
folly.

For the people may have every necessary truth of scripture, and every thing
necessary for them to know, concer nynge the salvation of their souls, trewly
taught and preched unto them, though the corpse and body of the scripture be
not translated unto them in their mother tongue.

For else had it ben wrong with english people from the faith first brought
into this realm, unto our own days / in all which time before, I am sure
that every english man and woman that could read yt, had not a book by
them of the scripture in english. And yet is there I dout not of those folk
many a good saved soul.

And secundly also, if the having of the scryputure in english, be a thing so
requysyte of precise necessyte, that the peoples souls should needs perysh but
if they have it translated into their own tongue: then must there the most
part perish for all that, except the preacher make farther prouysyon beside,
that all the people shall be able to read yt when they have yt / of which
people far more then four parts of all the whole dyuyded into ten, could
never read english yet, and many now to old to begin to go to scole, and
shall with gods grace though they never read word of scripture, come as well
to heaven, and as sone to, as him seit peradventure that preched y^ wise word.
Many have thought yt a thing very good and profitable, that y^ scripture well
and trewly translated should be in the english tongue. And all be yt that many
right wise and well learned both, and very virtuous folk also, both have
been and yet be in a far other mind: ye^ for mine own part, I both have
been and yet am also of the same opinion still, as I have in my dya^oge
declared, if the men were amended and the time mete therefore. But that it were
a thing of such precyse necessite, that the peoples soulys must needs
perysshe but if that be had / and that therefore we should su^er rather such a
poisoned translacyo^ then none, and wylfully kill our self with poysen rather
then we would take wholesome mete i^ at our mouth but y^ we may first have
it in our own hands: this herd I never any wise man say, no nor fool neither*
till Tindale came forth with his new translated scripture, translatynge the
truth of Christ into false Luthers heresies.

And yet when the brethren have herd such a wise word in a sermon / that
word use they to take solempnely for a sure authoryte, and say that all the
long reasons of sir Thomas More is here answered shortly with one word.

But now have I with mo words than one, made you plain and open the folly of
that wise word.

And when so ever he that preched it, can herafter again with many mo words
than I have here wryte^, prove his word wisely spoken / let him keep one copye
thereof with him self for lesynge, and send an other to me / and than that
copye that I receive, I will be bounden to eat it though the book be bounden
in bordes.

The.v. chapyter.
ANother sa^ple of such kind of answering have I seen made unto the first
chapyter of my third book of Tyndals co^futacyo^ / of which answer the
brethren boste greatly and say that I am answered even to the point.

For this word was said unto a friend of mine in great boste, by a special
sure secret brother of this new broched brotherhed / whereupon when I had herd
it, I longed sore to se that answer. For i^ good faith I had my self thought,
that I had so fully answered that chapyter of Tyndalys, which is whyther the
church were before the word or the word before the church / that he should
never without his shame be able to reply while he lived. And therefore lo^gyng
sore to se how I was answered now therein / I required my friend to find the
means if he might, that I might se the book / wenynge that some new work
of Tindals had been of late come over. But afterward he brought me word that
it was answered not beyond the sea, but here within the realm / not by any
book specially made against it, but in a sermon onys or ^wyes openly preched.
How be it not of a sodayn brayed, but fore studied and penned / whereof the book
as a spyryte in close goo^h about secretly, velut negotium per ambulans in
tenebris, among this blessed bretherhed / but I trust to turn it into
demonium meridianum, that every man may se him somewhat more plain appear, and
show him self in his own likeness.

Now is it so in deed, that in that chapyter of Tyndals there be certain lyuys
left out in mine answer. How be it they were of troth left out by ouerfyght
in the pryntyng which may well appear by this. For in mine answer I so
touch those words, that the leuynge out of them makes mine own more dark
and less perceived. And therefore are they content to find ^o fawte at the
leuyng out of them, but make as though all were in / and also because that mine
answer is as they bost by that sermon, so well and substancyally confuted.

But now because I would be loathe to be judged by the only brethren and
sisters of the false fraternite / and to the entente they shall all well se
that I fere not the judgment of indyfferent folk, I shall put abroad that all
folk may se those words of y^ solemn sermon, by which they boste that mine
answer unto that chapyter of Tyndales chapter is so goodly confuted.

The very formal words lo good reders of that sermon, for as far as
pertayne to this matter, after y^ copy that was delivered me (which copy I
reserve and keep for my declaracyo^) therein be these words that here after
follow.

Now yt follows in the epistle, Vo^^^^arie enim genuit nos verbo veritatis.

This text may be expowned after this manner, He made us by the ^routh of his
word / he made us (...) (ye know) of nothing / and he made us as the chyefe
and pryncypall of all his creatures. For he gave unto us wit and reason, the
which he gave unto no creature ^ynynge in the earth but only to us. But to
come more nere the matter, we may say that god wyllyngly begat us by the word
of his troth / and has put us here in to this world, and here to be as the
lord and ruler of al his creatures, the which he made for our comfort and
soco^re. But yet we may go more nere you, and say how that he has begoten us
by the word of his truth. Mark I pray you here, how that saint James says
that god has begoten us thorough his word of troth* Here yt appere^h that we
be not true of ^ure self / for we are made true by god ^^orough his word. And
where as of our self we were no another but ^yer^, god of his (...) go^dnes
has made us ^y his wor^e the chy^d^en ^f troth and of (...) as before we were
but (...) as works none other thing (...) even the very dyspleasure of god.

Now god o^ his mercy^ul goodness by his h^ly wor^e of troth has made us his
chyl^ren / that is to say the chy^dren of his tr^^uth, even as yt p^eased him
(says ^ay^te James) he has begoten us by the word of his troth. Mark how
that he says eu^n as it pleased him he begat v^. If we were begoten and made
as yt p^eased him / then was yt not done as yt pleased us. And again and y^ we
were begoten by him / then could not we give him none occa^yon to love us. F^r
why we came of him and not we of us. ^e^e may yo^ percey^e al^o, that this text
makes against them that will say, the church was before the gospel.

It is plain yn^u^h that the church (...) not before the word / for saint
James says that god begat us thorough the word of his troth. If we were
begote^ by the word, then needs must the word ^e before we were gote^^ / or
else how (...) we be begoten by the word / and by (...) ^^rde he says we
were begoten. If god bega^e us through the word / we must needs grant that he
that begat us was before that we were begoten / and he that begat us, begat
us by the word / then needs mu^^e the word be before that we were begoten.
Now then if this word were before we were begoten / how can we say that the
church was before this word.

If we mean by the church, the church of ^yme and stone, then yt is plain
enough that the word was before any such church was made. For we find that yt
was many a day after man was made, or eue^ there were any such chyrches made.
If ye mean by the church, the universal church of god, the which is the
congregacyon of all christen people. If you mean this church, and say how
this church was before the word: then saint James makes you an answer to
that, saying how that by the word this church was begoten. Then needs mus^e
we grant that the word of god was before any church was.

ye but some will not be content with this answer, but they will say that the
church was before that this word was written of any man, and yt was admytted
and allowed by the church, and so was the church before his word^. ye but yet I
will say to you again, how that this word was written before the church was /
^e and yt was not written by men, but yt was written by god our savior before the
beginning of the world / as witness saint Poule, where he says to the
Hebrews, D^bo leges meas etc. I will gene my laws ^ayth god into their hertes,
and in their minds shall I write yt. Behold how god gave yt them at the
beginning in their hertes, and wryt yt in their minds, and they exercyses his
law written in their he^tes in de^e and (...) effect.

Thus may ye ^e that at the beginning god wrote his laws in their hertes, and
therefore mu^^e we needs grant that the w^rde of god was taught to them long
or ever the congregacy^n taught yt. For you se that by the word we were begote
/ therefore the word must needs be before we were begoten / or else how could
the word begete us.

Some peradventure will say, that the church was before this word was written
in books of paper and pa^chement and such other things, and that the church
did admit them to be read of them, which they thought necessary to look on
them. They will say that the church was before this was done. ye but what
thing is this to the purpose, or what shall we need to stand arguing of this
matter.

It is plain enough to all men that has eyes to se and ^ares to hear, how
the word of god was before any chyr^h was, and how the word of god was written
before yt was written in any books or tabuls / and therefore what shall we need to
dyspute this matter. But good lord, if yt had not ben written by the
eua^gelyfies in those days, how should we do in these days, the which bring
forth the scripture for them in deed / and yet they will bear them in hand
that yt is no scripture, and if yt had not ben written in books then. Not
wythstandyng ye may perceive how the word was or ever the church was, and the
word begat us and not we the word / and also yt was written or ever the
church allowed yt to be written.

Now good readers, to the intent ye may the better perceive for what purpose
the bretherhed bosteth these words, ye shall understand that where as Luther
first and Tyndale after him, tell us for a fundacyon of all their abomynable
heresies, that there is nothing that ought to be taken for a sure and undoubted
troth of the christen bylyefe, but if it may be proved by plain and euydent
scripture: the kings hyghnes in his most famous book of assercyon of the
sacraments, laid against Luther / and I out o^ the same book of my said
sovereign lord* took and laid against Tyndale and all such, that the word of
god is part written in the scripture, and part unwritten that appears not
proved therein / as for ensample y^ perpetual virgynyte of our lady and other
diverse points which were only taught by Christ to his apostles and by them
fo^th to the church / and so by tradycyon of the church bysyde the scripture
and without writing, taught and delivered unto christen people from age to age
/ and so the faith and bylyefe of those things kep^ and continued fro
thapo^^les days unto our own time. And that if the church were nothing
boun^en to believe, but only the things plainly written in scripture / than had
all folk b^fo^^ Moses days been left at lyberty^ to leave all gods words
vnbyleued. And than had Crystes church in the beginning ben at liberty to leave
a great part of Crystes own words vnbyleued. For the church was gathered and
the faith byleued, before any part of the new testament was put in writing.
And which writing was or is the true scripture, neither Luther nor Tindale
knows but by the credence that they give to the church.

And therefore sith the word of god is as strong unwritten as written, and which
is his word written Tyndale can not tell but by the church, which has by the
assystence of the spyryte of god therein y^ gift of dyscrecy on to know it /
and sith that that gift is given (as saint Austayn says and ^uther him self
confesses) to this common known catholyke church: why should not Luther and
Tyndale as well believe the church, in that it tells them, this thing did
Christ and his apostles say, as they must believe the church (or else believe
nothing) in that it tells them this thing did Crystes eua^gelystes and
apostles write.

Now good readers, Tyndale seeing how sore this reason of the kings hyghnes
does towch and ^urne up the very fundacyo^ and great part of his heresies: he
does i^ his book against me, of which book he makes the title, which is the
church and whether it may err or not, put this chapy^er, Whether the church
were before the gospel, or the gospel before the church. which chapyter to
the end ye the more clearly perceive the matter, I shall rehearse you hole / and
after that some part of mine answer thereto. And tha^ if ye read again the
wor^es of this sermon y^ I have here inserted before / every child almost
shall be well able to judge, whyther this preacher have in his sermon avoided
well mine answer^ or no. These are Tyndals wo^des.

^^^ther d^ute there is, whether the church or (...) be before the gospe^l or
the gospel before the church. Which que^^yon is as hard to solue, as
whether the father be elder then the son, or the son elder then his father.
For the hole scryptu^e and all beleuynge he^tes tes^yfye* that we are begoten
through the word. ^herfore if the word begette the congregacyon, and he y^
begets is before him that is begoten / then is the gospe^^ before the
church. Paul also Romano.ix. says, How shall they call on whom they believe
not? And how shall they believe without a preacher?

That is, Christ must first be preached (...) men can believe in him. And then
yt follows, that the word of the preacher must be before the says of the
byleuer.

And therefore in as myche as the word is before the faith, and faith makes
the congregacyon / therefore is the word or gospel before the congregacyon.

And again, as the air is dark of yt self, and receives all her light of
the ^o^^ even so are all men's hertes of the^ self dark with lies and receive
all their trenth of gods word, in that they consent thereto.

And moreover as the dark air gives the son no light / but contrary wise
the light of the son in respect of the air is of it self, and lyghteneth
the air, and purges yt from darkness: even so the lyeng heart of man can
give the word of god no tre^th / but contrary wise y^ treuth of gods word is
of her self and lyghtneth the hertes of the byleuers, and makes them true /
and cleanses them from lies / as thou redest Ioh^^.xv. ye be clean by reason of
the word. Which is to be understand, in that the word had pu^ged their
hertes from lies, from false opinyons and from thinking evil good, and
ther^ore from consenting to sin. And John.xvi^. Sanctyfy them o ^ather
^horow thy treuthe. And thy word y^ ^^euth. And thus thou seeft that gods
troth depends not of man. It is not true because man so says or admytteth
yt for true. But man is true because he believes yt, te^^^fyeth, and g^ueth
witness in his heart that yt is true. And Christ also says him self John.v.
I rec^yue no witness of man. For if the multitude of mannys witness might
make ought true, then were the doctrine of Mahemete trewer then Christ's.

Lo good reders, here have ye herd Tyndals chapyter / the matter whereof y^
brethren boste that the words of that sermon do so well and substa^cyally
maintain, against mine answer made unto this chapyter.

But now to thentent ye may your self judge, whyther y^ sermon may bear out
their ^oste or not / I shall rehearse you some part of mine answer. Lo thus
begins mine answer unto Tindals chapyter.

Lo he that redeth thy^ and hereth not thansw^r^ / except him self be well
typed in the matter / may wene that Tyndale in these words had quit him self
syke a man / and borne me over quyte / he solueth the obieccyon so plainly /
and plays therwyth so pleasauntly. But now when ye sha^^ understand that
never man wa^ so mad to make this obieccyon to Tyndale but him self / then
shall ye laugh^ to se that ^e wreste^eth all alone and gives him self a fall
/ and in his merry solucyon mocketh also no man but him self.

I said in my dyasoge that the church was before the gospel was written / and
that the faith was taught, and men were baptized, and masses said and the
other sacraments my nystred among criste^ people before any part of the new
testament was put in writing / and that this was done by the word of god
unwritten. And I said also there / and yet say here again / that the right
faith which Adam had and such as in the same faith succeeded him long ere
writing began, was taught by the word of god vnwryte^ / and so went from man to
man fro the father to the son by mouth. And I said that this word of god
unwritten / is of as great authoryte as is the word of god written.

I showed also that the chirch of Christ has been / is / and eu^r shall be /
taught and instructed by god and his holy spyryte with his holy word of either
hynde / that is to wit both with his word written and his word unwritten /
and that they which will not believe gods word but if he put it in
writing / be as plain infydeles as they that will not believe it wryte^ / sith
gods word takes his authoryte of god that speaks it / and not of man that
writes it.

And th^re is like suerty and like certain knowledge of the word of god
unwritten as there is of the word of god written / sith ye know neither the tone
nor the the other to be the word of god, but by the tradycyon of the church.

which church as all christian m^n believe / and the scripture shew^th / and
saint Austayne declar^th / and Luther him self confesses / and the devil him
self says not nay / the ble^sed spyryte of god has inwardly ta^ght /
tea^heth / and ^uer shall teach / to know / judge and dyscerne the word of
god from the word of man and shall keep the church from error / ledynge it
into every troth / as Crys^e says him self in the.xvi. chapyt^r of saint
Iohans gospel. which he did not if he suffered the church to b^ dampnably
deceived in taking the word of man for the word of god / whereby it should instead of service to be done to god / fall in unfaithfulness / and with
idolatry do service to the devil.

And therefore I showed in my said dyaloge / and yet the kings hyghnes myche
more plainly showed in his most erudyte famous book against Luther out of
which I took it: that the word of god unwritten is of as great authoryte / as
certain / and as sure / as is his word wryte^ in the scryp^ure. which point is
so fast and sure pytched upon the rocke^ our savior Christ him self that
neither Luther, Tindale, nor ^uskyn, nor all the hell hounds that the devil
has in his kenell / never hitherto could nor while god lives in heu^n and the
devil lies in hell never hereafter shall (bark they / baw^e they never so
fast) be able to wreste it out.

And that they be all as I tell you so feeble in this point whereupon theffect of
all their hole heresies hangs (for but if they veynquyshe this one point /
all their heresies fully be burned up and fall as flat to asshen as it were
allmoyse all obstynate heretykes did) ye may se a clear prove by these words
of Tyndale / which he has set so gloriously forth in the fore front of his
battle / as though they were able to win the hole field. For where as I
said that the gospel and the word of god unwritten was before the church /
and by it was the chirch begone gathered and toughte / and that the church was
before that the gospel that now is written w^^ written / that is to wy^^e before
any part of the gospel was written / for as for all the hole gospel that is
to wit all the words of god that he would have known byleued and kept / was
yet never written: this being the thing that I said Tyndale with all the help
he has had of all the heretykes in A^mayne this two or three year to gyther is
yet in such d^spa^re to be able to match therewyth, that he is with shame
enough feign to forgette that I said the church was before the gospel written.
which thing him self can not deny, and is feign to frame the doubt and make
the obieccyon / as though I had said that the church had been before the
gospel and the word of god unwritten / whereof him self knows well that I said
clean the contrary And therefore good reders having this thing in your
remembrance: take now the ^ayne to read Tyndal^ words again and ye shall
have a pleasure to se how fondely ^e (...) before you. For now his craft open^d
and decla^ed unto you^ ye shall per^^^ue that he plays nothing ^^ene but
fa^eth (...) that conuayeth his galls so craftily that all the table spy^th
them.

Lo good readers, here have I now rehearsed you but a pyece of mine answer
unto that chapyter of Tyndale / and yet by this one pyece alone may ye clearly
perceive, that all those words of that sermon go so far wide fro the ^oynt,
that they not only do nothing help Tyndale (for all the labor that they
take about yt) but also the preacher of them takes a fowler faller than
Tyndale / in that the preacher stumbleth at the same stock, and falls into
the same puddell that Tyndale did, and that after that he was warned by mine
answer made to Tindale before.

For this here ye se, that this preacher in the first part of his words,
touches not the matter / but little and little he desce^deth thereto by the
expownynge of these words of saint James, voluntary enim ge^uit nos verbo
ver^^atis / that is in english, He has wyllyngly begoten us by the word of
truth.

^ow be yt the peacher englysheth it thus, (...) which words after that he
has expowned after diverse manners, he comes at last to that exposycyon, by
which he expowneth those words in this wise, that god has wyllyngly by his
word made us the (...) of ^rewth and of (...). And after a thing or two noted
and marked therein, which I shall happily make you to mark well and s^ somewhat
more therein hereafter, then the preacher shows you there / he comes to y^
point with which we be now in hand and therein thus he begins. (...).

But now do you good readers clearly perceive and se, that this precher says
wrong. For while they against whom he preaches, that is to wit, they that
say the church was before y^ gospel written, do both m^ane and plainly, write
that the church was not by^^^^ (...) that the he (...) would make men (...),
that gods word were of none authorite nor worthy to be byleued, but if yt
were written in the books: now I (...) that sith ye know good ^^aders, that
they against whom this preacher thus precheth, do mean, and say, and write,
as ye now se they do / ye ca^ not but clearly perceive and se, that this
precher does in this point but labor to blind his audience, and meteth
nothing with the matter*

For now this thing had in mind and co^sydered / all his reason after, which
he takes out of Tyndales chapyter, wa^eth even deed for cold.

For what he^e or what one spark of life after this thing considered, have all
his words y^ follow, wherein he says.

It is plain enough that the church was not before the word / for faint
James says that god begat us thorough the word of his troth. If we were
begote^ by the word, then needs must the word be before we were gotten / or
else how (...) we be begoten by the word / and by the word he says we were
begoten. If god be ga^e us through the word / we mu^t needs grant that he that
begat us was before that we were begoten / and he that begat us* begat us by
the word / then needs must the word be before that we we^^ (...). Now then
if this word were bef^^e we were begoten / how can we say that the church
was before this word.

If we mean by the church, the church of ^yme and stone* then yt is plain
enough that the word (...) before any such church was made. For we find that
yt was many a day after man was made, or ever there were any such chyrches
made. If ye mean by the church, the universal church of god, the which is
the congregacyon of all christen people. If you mean this church, and say how
this church was before the word: then ^aint James makes you an answer to
that, say^nge how that by the word this church was begoten. Then needs must
we grant that the word of god was before any church was.

All this chyldesh reason ye wot well, which Tyndale has begoten him, and
which he brings out of Tyndales chapyter, and fathereth yt upon saint
James, be yt never so quick i^ another matter, is yet in this as touching them
against whom he preaches yt, clean quayled in the travail, and utterly borne
deed / while they against whom he preaches, say not precysely that the
church was before the gospel, nor before gods word, but only say that the
church was before the gospel and gods word was put in writing.

And that his reason is deed, as I say yt is / him self that preached yt
perceyueth / and therefore he goth farther and draws nerer to the matter, and
says.

ye but some will not be content with this answer, but they will say that the
church was before that this word was written of any man, and yt was admytred
and allowed by the church, and so was the church before his word, ye but yet I
will say to you again, how that this word was written before the church was /
y^ and yt wa^ not written by men, but yt was written by god our savior before the
beginning of the world / a^ witness saint Pon^e* where he says to the
Hebrews, Dabo leges mea^ etc. I will geu^ my law^ says god into their hertes,
and in their mynde^ ^^all I write yt. Behold^ how god gave yt them at the
beginning in their herte^, and wryt yt in their minds, and they exercyses his
law written in their hertes in deed and in effect.

Thus may ye se that at the begynnyng^ god wrote his laws in their hertes, and
therefore m^ste we needs grant that the word of god was taught to them long
or ever the congregacyon taught yt. For you se that by the word we were begote^
/ therefore the word must needs be before we were begoten / or else how could
the word beget^ v^.

By these words good readers ye se, that him self perceyueth that all his
other words were not wurth a ryshe, because they came not nere y^ purpose, nor
any thing towcheth them against whom he precheth them. And therefore seeing that
Tyndale is by mine answer therein proved a fool / he goth as ye se ferther than
Tindale went. But there in the nerer he comes to the point, the more he
proves him self to go the ferther from reason. For what reason has he y^ in
arguyng against other, says but the same y^ they say?

Now all that ever he says in these words, say we against whom he precheth
the^.

And we not only say the things that he says now, that is to wit that
goddys word was ere ever it was written, and that it was written in hearts ere
ever it was written in books / but these be also the things that we specially
lay against him, whose said chapyter this preacher would with these words
defend. For sith the gospel o^ Christ and the words of god that are now
wryte^ in books, were all written in hearts before they were written in books,
and yet were at that time of the same strength and authoryte that they be now /
we say to Luther and Tyndale and all such oher heretics, that they say false
in that they preche and teache, that me^ are bou^de^ to believe nothing but if it
be wryte^ in books / sith god is at his liberty to give his word in to his
church even yet at this day, by his own mouth, through thinspyracyon of his
holy spyryte sent thereunto, and by him self abiding ever therein / and at y^
prechyng of the church, write it i^ y^ hertes of y^ herers, as well and as
surely as ever he gave his word to his church by his apostles, and wrote it in
the peoples hearts at their prechynge, at such time as it was yet unwritten in
any of thapostles books.

And over this, we tell them that the same church, by only which church they
now know which books be those tha^ have the word of god in them that the
apostles and euange tystes have written / the same church I say does tell them,
that the words of god which god will have us believe, be not all written in
those books but some part still remain only written in hearts, as before the
books written they did all to gyther. And we tell them that Tyndale must as
well believe the church in telling him which be those words of god y^ yet
remain unwritten, as he does and must believe it in tellyng him which be those
books, in which the words of god are wryte^.

And therefore good reders what things in this world could this precher have
devised worse to bring forth against me for Tyndals defense, than those with
which as ye se Tyndale is most cle^ely confounded.

But now shall ye se, that this precher perceyueth it well enough him self.
And therefore after that he has set forth Tyndals reason, and dyssymuled
mine answer that I have made to it / and so before his audyence wrestled a
while in the dark, where for lack of syghte of the matter they might se how
he fell: he waxed yet half weary thereof at last, and somewhat ashamed to, lest
he were peradventure spyed / and feign would he therefore have shaken of the
matter, and rydde him self out honestly / and therefore in conclusyon he comes
down to this.

Some peradventure will say, that the church was before this word was written
in books of paper and parchement and such other things, and that the church
did admit them to be read of them, which they thought necessary to look on
them. They will say that the church wa^ before this was done* ye but what
thing (...) this to the purpose, or what shall we need ^o stand arguing of
this matter.

It is plain enough to all men that has eyes to se and ears to hear, how
the word of god was before any church was, and how the word of god was written
before yt was written in any books or tabuls / and therefore what shall we need to
dyspute this matter. But good forde, if yt had not ben written by the
eua^gelysles in those days, how should we do in these days, the which bring
forth the scripture for them in deed / and yet they will bear them in hand
that yt is no scripture, and if yt had not ben written in books then. Not with
standing ye may perceive how the word was or ever the church was, and the
word begat us and not we the word / and also yt was written or ever the
church allowed yt to be written.

Here have ye seen good readers after long wrestelynge with me, what shyft
this precher makes to shake y^ matter of. For seeing that he can in no wise
defend Tyndalys reason, he would at last feign shake of the questyon. And in
deed the questyo^ as Tyndale frames it of his own fasshyo^ for his own
advantage, is very fryuolouse and folysshe. And therefore this preacher goth
(as I say) somewhat ferther and comes nerer to the point, in which the matter
of the questyon lies. But than because he can not defend Tyndale and avoid
mine answer, after y^ time dreuyn forth in forneshynge of Tyndals reason /
when he comes to the point he leueth mine answer untouched, and would shake
of y^ question for naught

But that thing now good readers will not well be for him. For the necessyte of
this questyo^ you se now your self. For sith Luther, and Tyndale, and other
such heretykes, do teach that no word of god is now to be byleued, nor to be
taken for gods word by the teaching of the catholyke church, but if it be
wryte^ in scripture: they drove us of necessyte to tell them again, that the
church was before the scripture, and before that any of gods words were
written therein / and that all his words that he will have byleued, were never
written / and that he is not so tongue tayed, but that he is at lybertye to speak
yet mo words when he will, and may bind us as well to believe them, as ever he
bound us to believe any word that ever he spoke before be it unwritten or
written. And that in all such things Luther and Tyndale both, and friar Barns
to, and all the heretykes of them, must (as I said) of reason believe the
church as well when it tells them, these things Christ has by his own
spyryte or by the mouth of his apostles taught us, as when it tells them
these things has Crist by the pen of his apostles written us. Now is this
knot so sure, that it can never be losed, but if these heretykes or this
precher for them, can by plain scripture prove us y^ god has caused al such
things to be written in scripture all ready / and over that made a promise,
either that he will never speak any such word more, or that if he do, he will
at the least wise take no dyspleasure with us, though we tell him plainly that
sith it is not in scripture all ready, he shall write it in if he will, or else
will we not believe him.

The.vi. chapyter.
ANd this precher him self so well perceyueth that this point is true that I
tell you, that he would feign if he could prove it, say that all such things
are written all ready in scripture. And therefore though because he sees that I
have in the last chapyter of my first part of Tyndals confutacyon,
overthrown Tyndale therein, he forbear to afferme it forth out in plain and
open words: yet he gives his audyence a proper insinuacyon thereof, and makes
a pretty glau^ce thereat, in those words where he says in the la^te end. But
good lord, if yt had not ben written by the eua^gely^tes in those days, h^we
should we do in these days, the which bring forth the scripture for them in
deed / and yet they will bear them in hand that yt is no scripture, and if yt
hand not ben written in books then. Not wythstandyng ye may perceive how the
word was or ever the church was, and the word begat us and not we the word /
and also yt was written or ever the church allowed yt to be written.

By these words would he lo (though he say it not plain out) that folk
should wene that of any thing which we be bounden to believe, the eua^gelystes
and apostles left in their days naught vnwryte^* which point if yt could be
proved would help some heresies well forth, but yet not so many as heretyques
would make men wene. For many things that they say be not in scripture, are
yet in scripture i^ deed. As is for the sacrament of co^fyrmacion, and anelyng,
and holy orders, and matrymony, and the very blessed body and blood of Christ
in the holy sacrament of the altar. And for good works against faith alone,
and for holy vows of chastyte against thabominable bychery of freres that
wedde nonnes, and many such other things. And in all such matters the
questyo^ is not of the word written or unwritten, but upon the interpretacyo^
and the right understanding of gods word all ready written.

And therein is in effect the questyon also no more but whether that in the
construccion and exposycyon of holy scripture, we should of reason better
believe holy saint Austayne / holy saint Ambrose, holy saint Hierom, holy sayn
Cypriane, holy saint Chrysostom, holy saint Basyle, holy saint Cyryll, and
the three Gregoryes of Greek holy saints all three, and holy saint Gregory the
pope, with all the other old holy doctors and fathers of the faithful
doctrine on the tone side / or else on the the other side lewd Luther, and
Lambert, Barns, Huyskyn, and Swynglius, Swartherth, Tyndale, George Joy, and
Denk^hius, Baynam, Bayfelde, Hytton* and Teuxbery, with brother Byrt, and young
father Fryth.

There would be now between these two sorts no gre^dou^ in the choice (as me
thinks) if he that should chose have wit.

And in such matters this is the great questyon in deed / which thing if any
of their favorers dare deny, and will afferme, that in the co^struccio^ of the
scripture they have the old holy doctors on their side / let all these
heretyques and all that bear them favor, find out among them all so myche as
one of all the old^ holy saints, that so did construe the scripture, as now
these new heretyques do for wedding of monks, freres, and nonnes, which the
whole catholyke church all this fyften hundred year, before these late lewd
heresies began have ever more abhorred and holde^ for abominable / let these
new brethren (I say) now find out among them all, any one of the old holy
saints, that said the breche of their vows was no sin / and then am I
content they say that all the remanau^t be whole upon their part in all the
remanau^^ of al their poisoned heresies.

But on the the other side, y^ they can not among them all find out so myche as
one old holy man for their part in this point, in which we can bring many
against them: then must they needs confess, that in the construccion of the
scripture (for as much at the least wise as apperteyneth to this point)
saving for the undoubted faith of the whole catholic church full fyften
hundred year to gether against these vowbrekynge brethern (which thing alone
suffyseth for their full conde^pnacyon) ellis stands all the question but in
this, whyther of the twain should in thexposycion of holy scripture be by
reason among the unlearned people better byleued / the old holy gracious
doctors and saints, or these new wedded monks and freres graceless
apostatas and heretyques.

And then sith no good christian man can doubt whyther part is the better of
these twayn / no good man can there dout (ye se well) but that these new
doctors, Luther, Lambert, Tyndale, Huyskyn* and Swynglius, with all their
adhere^tes, be plain abomynable heretics in this one point at the lest. which
point while yt is so shameful and full of fylthy bestelynes / I dare be bold
to say that neither has that man nor that women any respect or regard of any
clennesse or honest, that can with favor vouchsaufe to read their books or
here them, till they first forswere and abjure the defense and mayntenau^ce of
that incestuouse sacrylege and very bestely bychery.

The.vii. chapyter.
BUt now to return to the point which this precher would covertly color in
his said words, and would make it seem that thapostles and euangelystes had
written all things that god byndeth us to bylyefe, where he says, But good
lord if yt had not ben written by theuangelistes in those days, how should
we do in these days the which bring forth the scripture for them in deed /
and yet they wylt bear them in hand yt is no scripture and if yt had not ben
written in books then*

These words seem to be myswriten, either in the pryncypall book or in the
copye.

For I think it would be, if it had not been written by the euangelystes in
those days, how should we do in these days, in which we bring forth the
scripture for us in deed, and yet they bear us in hand that it is no
scripture. How be it how so ever his words were in deed / he meneth by them
(as ye se) to show y^ there was a necessyte wherefore god caused all necessary
things to be put in writing. But unto that point as I have all ready made
answer unto Tyndale in the confutacyon / all the things that the church
techeth for necessare, and say they were gods words, all those I mean
which these heretykes say be not specyfyed in scripture, and that therefore
they be not gods words nor any necessary treuthes, but false inuencyo^s of
Satan (as Tindale says) and da^pnable dremys of men (as Barns says) this
precher yet can not deny, but kept have such things ben in remembrance and
observed this thousand year, ye twelve or thyrtene hundred among christen
people, ye and as long as the gospels of Christ has been written, and happily
somewhat before to, as may be gathered of old ancient wrytynges.

How be it though it were somewhat less shall little force for the matter. For if
they may abide by any mean in remembrance a thousand year / by the self
same means may they abide in remembrance another thousand to. Than sych
these folks say that these things being so long preserved and kept in
remembrance, be out of the scripture: now would I wit of this preacher,
whyther they have been so ^onge kept and preserved by god, or by man, or by
the devil. If he say by god / than be they of likelyhed good things, and not
falsedes but treuthes. And if he say that they be false, and that yet god has
kept them / than follows it at the least that he could have kept them as well
all this long while though they had been ^rewe, and that without the
scripture, as he has kept them hitherto.

And thereof follows it also that he had no necessyte to cause ^uery
necessary troth that he would have kept in remembrance to be put in y^
scripture, as this precher wol^e have it seem.

But now if this preacher will say on the the other side, that these things have
not ben preserved by god among christen people / but be false things, and have
all this long while been kept either by man or devil: yet sith god is as
strong and as mighty as man and devil both, it follows ye se well that the
thing which they have done in keeping of false things, god could as well do
in the keeping of true things, and neded to the keeping no more scripture then
they.

And thus good readers every way ye se that this reason of this precher* which
Tyndale laid against me before him, y^ god did cause all necessary things to
be written in scripture, because that else they could not have continued in
remembrance / this reason I say ye se can not hold. For those things have
continued as long in remembrance, which things them self say be not in
the scripture.

For where this precher protests the necessyte of y^ putting of all thing
in scripture, with a figure of apostrophe and turnynge his tale to god /
cryenge out, O good lord, if yt had not ben written by the eua^gelystes in
those days, how should we do in these days, the which bring forth the
scripture for the^ in deed / and yet they will bear them in hand that yt is no
scripture.

These words lo prove plainly for my part, that there is as great suerty in
the word of god unwritten and taught unto the church by the spyryt without the
scripture, as in his word written in the scripture. For who so believe the
church, will grant both / and who so believe not y^ chirch, will deny both, as
this preacher here says him self. For he knows not which is the scripture
but by the church And therefore where he says y^ men now a days if we lay the^
forth y^ scripture in deed, they will bear them in hand yt is no scripture /
verily if yt hap (as yt happeth often) that the preachers of these new sects
do lay forth for them very scripture in deed, which scripture makes not for
them in deed, but some falls gloses that they give the scripture in deed / there
will the true catholyque preachers say, that they abuse the scripture in deed.
But they will never say that the scripture which they brought forth, is no
scripture in deed. For y^ way does none use but these heretics only / nor
they can not all say that there is any lefe or line, tha^ ever them self have
taken for scripture hitherto, but the catholyque church of whom they learned
yt does afferme the same. But on the the other side there are some parts of
scripture, which the whole catholyque church affermeth for scripture / which
parts yet these heretyques afferme for none. As for ensample the self same
pystle of saint James, which this precher made that sermon upon / which
pystle friar Luther and friar Barns both, let not boldly to deny for
scripture, because in many places yt destroys their heresies. And yet is
there never an heretyque of them for all that, but where yt may serve to seem
to prove his purpose, there will he bring yt forth for saint James own, and
find no fault therwyth.

And thus good christian readers here have I somewhat showed you how little cause
the brethern have to bost that pyece of that sermon, and say that it has well
defended Tindales said chapter, and clearly co^foded meu^ in that part of my
con^utacyon. And this have I showed you somewhat the more at length, because yt
touches a point that is either for the maynteynynge or co^fou^dyng of many
great he resyes a very special kay.

The.viii. chapyter.
^or as for the preachers other pieces in y^ beginning of those words, I have
let pass untouched / where he says, he has begoten us by the word of his
truth, even as yt pleased him* Mark that saint James says even a^ yt
pleased him. If we were begoten and made even as yt pleased him / then was yt
not done as yt pleased us. And again if we were begoten by him / then could
we give him none occasyon to love us. For why we came of him and not we of us.
These words good readers have no great harm in them at the first face. But
they allude unto certain words of Tyndale, with which he argues against me,
because I say in my dyaloge that man may with his fre will by good endeavor of
him self, be a worker with god toward the atteynyng of faith. Against which
saying of mine, Tyndale (as I have showed in my second part of Tyndales
co^futacio^, in mockage of man's endeavor toward the bylief, and in scornyng
that man should captive his understanding and su^dew his reason into the service
of faith) answers me with an hydyouse exclamacy on / and cryenge out upon my
fleshelynes and folly, fometh out his high spyrytuall sentence after this
fashyon.

O how betleblynde i^e fleshely reason^ the will has none ^peracyon at a^^ in
the workynge of faith in my soul, no more then the chy^d has in the begetynge
of his own father. For says Poule yt is the gift of god and not of us. My
wit mu^te sh^we me a true couse or an apparaunte cause why, (...) my will
have any workynge at all.

To this pyece of Tyndales tale yt seems, that this preacher does allude. And
he covertly lays as ye se, the reason that Tyndale lays for it, of the
begeter and him that is begote^. But he lays not the authoryte of saint
Poule as Tindal does. But he lays y^ words of saint James, why^he he has
here in hand, God has wyl^yngly begotten us with the word of his truth /
and stycketh for this purpose upon this word, wyllyngly, and argues thus,
god begat us wyllyngly says here sa^nte James, that is to wit after his own
will, and as yt pleased him / ergo he did not begete us after our own will nor
as yt pleased us.

This argument has this preacher underpropped and enforced, with interpretynge
of the word wyllyngly / for that is the word of saint Iamys. which word the
preacher s^rengtheth here with after his o^ne will and as yt pleased him self.

And yet neither that word^ wyllyngly of yt self, nor strengthed with all
these other, can make but a bare form of arguing if yt were in another matter.
For if I desired a man to give me a thing, and labored myche to him therefore,
and myche endeuered my self in many things to please him, to thente^t that he
^holde give yt me, and that he theruppon so did / this were then but a pore
argument to say thus: this man wyllyngly gave me this thing, and after his
own will, and as yt pleased him / ergo he gave yt me not after mine own will
and as yt pleased me. For as ye se, yt both pleased him to give yt me, and
also yt pleased me that he so should / or else I would never have desired yt,
nor never have labored therefore.

And thus ye se that this authorite of saint Iamys no thing helps this
precher in his purpose against all occasyon and all endeavor of man toward
the getting of faith, by which we be bygoten.

But Tyndale layth that text of saint Iamys against the sacrament of baptism,
to prove that the word of the promise does all the wurke in the rege^drynge
of the soul by faith / and that the water toward the infusyo^ of grace, or
wesshynge of the soul, is none instrument of god, nor no thing else but a
bar^ graceles token / because saint Iamys says that god has cleansed us by the
word of troth, which Tindale there expouneth by the word of his promise / as
though never a word of god were true, but only his promise. Now of troth
the word of god that a precher precheth, by which the points of the faith be
learned / be signs and tokens that sygnyfye the things in the mind, which
are by those words brought unto the herers ^are, and from the ear to the heart
/ as the water sygnyfyeth and betokens the inward washyng of the soul in
that sacrament. And as god uses the tone toke^ of y^ word to the washing and
clensynge of the soul through y^ mean of obedyence of the will, in captyuynge
of his reason and understanding in to the seruyse of faith, by credence and
assent geuyng unto the word of faith / in which what so ever Tyndale say and
this prechour to, man having age and use of reason, may be a wyllyng wurker
with god / or else whereto should any man advise and bid another come unto the
true faith: so may god use the the other toke^ of the water as an instrument also
to the same purpose, by the like mean of obedyence on the mannys part, in
submyt tynge him self to that ablu^yon, for the fulfyllynge of gods
commandment and ordinance.

How be it what I ferther answer Tindal to these words of saint Iamys / who
so list to se, let him read in my first part of Tyndalys confu^acyon in the
answer unto Tindals preface y^ number.liii. and than set this to it / and he
shall se that neither Tyndale there nor this precher here, has by their manner
of expounynge these words of saint Iamys, won the^ self much wurshyp. How
be it of troth the thing that goth nerer to their purpose against all the
wurke of fre will, and all endeavor of man toward the attaynyng of faith, is
the authoryte of saint Poule that Tyndale brings forth / which yet proves
it not. And the reason that he lays by sa^ple of y^ father and y^ son /
which reason this precher though somewhat fayntely sith he sees it will not
serve, yet somewhat repeteth here by these words, where he says, And again if
we were begoten ^y him, then could not we give him none occasyon to love us /
for why we came of him and not we of us* by these words he means the thing
that Tyndale alleges where he says, The will has none operacyon at al in
the working of faith in my soul, no more then the child has in the begetynge
of his father.And of troth Tyndale and his precher said somewhat, if in the
spyrituall generacyon the man that is regendred, were ever more as far from
all wurke of will at such time as god goth about to bygete him by faith, as is
the child at such time as his graundefather goes about by nature to byget his
father.

But now on the the other side, if in the generacyo^ at the bege^yng of his
father, y^ son be not yet so much as a child, nor has no will at all / and at
the time of the spyrytuall regeneracyon of him self, he that is regendred
hap to be more than a child, and have the fredome of his own will, and has
the choice thereby put in his own hand, whyther he will at goddys calling to
faith by redyng, prechynge, miracle, and such other occasyons, with good
inward mocyons added also thereto, follow the spyryte, and walk and wurke with
god by captyuynge of his own understanding and subdewynge of his own reason,
into the assent and bylyef of the things that he shall be moved unto, and by
calling upon the contynuaunce of gods gracious help thereunto, and thereby
come into the service of faith / or whyther he will else reiecte gods good
and gracious mocyon and resyst it, and so fle from the gettyng of the gift of
faith: if the man I say be at the time of his spyrytuall bygetynge in this
case, as every man that has at the time age and use of reason is / tha^ is
this sample that Tyndale does there put, and that this preacher does here
repete, of the child at the carnal birth of his father, much less like the
man at the spyrytuall birth of him self, then is an apple like unto an oyster.

How be yt good readers, because the brethren blame my books for the length /
I will make no longer argument of this matter here / for in these few words yt
appears metely well.

But if any man think him self with this not yet fully satysfyed, then has
he need for his contentacyon to se the matter handled somewhat more at length.
And who so therefore lysteth so to do, let him read in my fourth book of
Tyndales co^futacion, which is in y^ first book of the second part, in the
chapter of y^ manner and order of our eleccyon beginning. If he list in y^
lefe that is marked with the number of.c.xii. and then will his own reason
serve him to se how far the mather goth: which if he read out, I dare boldly
promise that he shall there find such things, as against Tyndale and this
preacher both, shall as for this point in all reason be suffycyent to satysfye
him.

But now if this preacher will peradventure say, that of his word^ in both
these matters I have mysse rehearsed him / I am ready to bring forth my copye and
the man of whom I had yt to. Or else I shall make him a much fayrer offer /
because he may peradventure say that he never wrote that sermon him self, but
that some of his audyence which of devotion wrote as myche as they bare away
upon the heryng, did write yt dimynute and ma^gl^^ for lack of good
rememb^^unce / let him upon this answer of mine seen (if yt ^^ppen to come
into his han^es) write his own words him self / not only as well as he the^
suddenly spoke the^, but as well also as he ca^ with long laysoure make them.
And when he has done in the^ the best that ever he can, and take whose help
he will to / if he make it so as he may therwyth avoid and refell my co^futyng
of Tyndale in those two points that those words of his sernon touch, then
dare I be bounden to forswere this land, and live in Antwarpe and be Tyndals
man.

How be it if in the matter of ma^nys endeavor toward the attaynynge of faith,
by walking on with god wyllingly after that god has prevented him with his
grace, by calling on him and gyuynge him occasyon to come forward / if any
brother think to escape and avoid my proof in the place before remembered, by
the dystynccyon that Tyndale has learned of Philyppe Swar^^^the, and brings
forth against me of hystorycall faith and feeling faith (which dystynccyo^
diverse of the brethren and systerne have in their mouths now, and therwyth
suddenly cast a myste before unlearned me^nys eyes, and make them adased for y^
time that never hard of it before) he y^ would wind away with this
dystyncyon, shall nothing avoid my confutynge of Tindale in that place. For
if his dystynccyon be true / yet upon gods gracious preue^cyon and first
calling upon, I say and there prove that the willing endeavor of man in
following, helps to the attaynynge of every manner kind of faith / and
procu^eth the progress and encreace of grace to the perfytynge of that virtue
in man and with man, which god first began in man by gods own preuencyon
without man / but in them that have age and dyscrecyon, uses not to fynysshe
and fulfill it without man / but wha^ man refuses (except he mende and turn)
else god leueth finally his own good bygone wurke vnfynysshed. And therefore
says saint Austayn to every man that has use of reason: He that has created
the without the, does not iustyfye the without the.

And yet for ^erther conclusyon, because I here say that the same dystinccyon
of hystorycall faith and felyng faith, glytereth now so gayly in the bretherns
eyes / let them read my confutacyo^ through. Or because they call that to
long, let them read but the seventh book, which is entytled the defense of
the secu^d reason against Tyndale. Or if they think y^ book alone to long,
let them leave a great part of the book, and begin in that lefe and that side
of the lefe that is marked with the number of.cccxl. And then if they can for
heart burning abide and endure to read it up to the end / I dare be bold to
warraunt, that they shall find the same gaye golden dystynccyon of hystorycall
faith and feeling faith, fou^den f^^st by Phylyp Swarterthe which like as friar
Huskyn ^^th na^en him self ^colampa^ius, has made his name n^w Mela^cthon)
This (...) I say so made by Melancthon, shall they se so brou^^t in there by
Tyndale and so se^ forth and furn^^he^ by the learning and labor of them
both, that it comes to such pass in conclusyon, that no part of all
Tynda^s tale is brought to more shameful confusyon.

But now the brethren will (when any good catholyque man provoke them to
read the place in my book) answer as dyue^se of them have done ere ^^is to
such good catholyque folk as provoked them thereto and offered to read yt with
them, and there upon to try between them whyther Tyndale or I had better
reason on our part: the brethren have upon this offer shronken at last
therfro, after great crakes made of Tyndales part, with great contempt of
mine answer before / and have answered y^ they will not myssespende their time
in redyng of mine answer, they se Ti^dales tale so sure.

Now of troth this had been a good answer and a reasonable, if when they were
fast in the true catholyque faith, they would thus have answered any such as
would have aduysed them to read in Tyndale, and search whether the faith of all
the holy saints and of all the whole corpse of crystendome this.xv. hundred
year to gether, were true or false. For that were a thing whereof yt were a
very fransey to doubt.

But now they that are fled from the faith of all them, of whose faith there
was no cause to doubt / and are fallen to the faith of a few faythless^ folk,
false apostatas wild wedded monks and freres and their fond dyscyples: if
they make them self so sure of their deuylyshe doctrine, that they refuse to
read the things that are written for the confutacyon of their errors / every
good catholyke man that so sees the^ do* may with good reason tell them y^
they do not cleue to these folyshe heretykes for any thing that they think
them to say ^^outh, but because they would feign yt were troth whyther yt be
or no / and that they show they^ frowar^nes therein very plainly, while their
hertes abhor and can not abide to read any book, by which their o^n
conscy^nce gives them y^ they shall find their opinions plainly proved false,
and their ar^h^^eretykes plainly proved folys. For if they hoped the
contrary, they would (I warra^nt you) be them self the first that would call
other thereto.

And thus myche for this ^^me suffyseth for this point.

The.ix. chapyter.
NOw come I to them that say I handle Tyndale and Fryth and Barons ungoodly
and with uncomely words, calling them by the name of heretykes and folys /
and so use them in words* as though the men had neither wit nor learning /
where as it can not be denied (they say) but y^ they be such as every man
knows well have both.

As for wit and lernyng I no where say that any of them have none / nor I
mean no ferther but for the matters of their heresies. And in the treating of
those / they she^ so little wy^ or lernyng either that the more they have, the
mo^^ appears the feblenesse of their pa^^e and the falshed of their heresies,
if they have any great wit or any great lernyng in deed, and than for all
that, in the defending of those matters with such folish handelynge so
shamefully co^founde them self.

How be it of very troth, god upon such folk as having wit and learning
fall wylfully from faith to false heresye, shows his wrath and indygnacio^
with a more vengeance in some part, than (as some doctors say) he does
upon the devil him self.

For (as diverse doctors hold opinyon) the fendes be fallen from grace, and
therefore have lost their glory / yet god has suffered them to keep their
gifts of nature still, as wy^te, bewty, strength, agylyte, and such other like.

And father Alphonse the Spaynish friar told me, that the deuyls be no such
deformed evil favored creaturs as men imagyne them / but they be in mind
proud, enuyouse, and cruel. And he bode me that if I would se a very right
image of a tend / I should no more but even look upon a very fair woman that
has a very shrewed fell cursed mind. And when I showed him that I never saw
none such, nor wist not where I might any such find / he said he could find
four or five / but I can not by leave him. Nor verily no more can I believe
that the fendes be like fair shrewd women if there were any such. Nor as the
world is, it were not good that young men should wene so. For they be so full
of courage, that were the fendes never so cursed, if they thought them like
fair women, they would never fere to adventure upon them onys. Nor to say the
treuth no more can I believe neither, that the dampened spyrytes have all their
natural gifts as whole and as perfayte as they had before their fall.

But surely if they have / tha^ (as I said before) god has on Tindale, Barns,
and Fryth, and those other heretykes, more showed his vengeance in some part,
then he did upon the de^yll. For in good faith god has as it seems fro these
folk taken away the be^te part of their wits.

For like wise as they that would have byelded up the toure of Babylon for
them self against god, had such a stop thrown upon them, that sodaynely
none understood what another said / surely so god upon these heretykes of our
time that go besyly about to hepe up to the sky their foull fylthy dunghyll
of all old and new false stynckyng heresies, gathered up together against the
true catholyke faith of Christ, that him self has ever hitherto taught his
true catholyke church: god I say, which wha^ the apostles went about to
preche the true faith, se^te down his own holy spyryt of unity, concord,
and treuth unto them, with the gift of speech and understanding, so that they
understood every man and every man understood them / has rered up and sent
among these heretykes the spyryte of error and lyenge, of dyscorde and of
dyuysyon, the dampened devil of hell, which so entangleth their tunges and so
dystempereth their* brains, that they neither understand well one of them
another, nor any of the^ well him self.

And this that I here say, who so list to read my books, shall find yt so
true and so plainly proved in many places, that he shall well se and say that
this is the thing which in my writing greueth this blessed bretherhed a little
more then the length.

And therefore where they find the ^aute that I handle these folk so foul /
how could I other do? For while I I declare and show their writing to be
such (as I needs must, or leave the most necessary points of all the matter
vntouehed) yt were very hard for me to handle yt in such wise, as when I
plainly prove them abominable he re^ykes and against god and his sacraments
and saints very blasphemouse folis, they should wene that I speak the^ fair.

But then they say that the pacyfyer which writes of the deuysyon between
the spyrytualty the temporalty, calls no man by no such names / but speak he
never so evil of any, he can yet use his words in fair manner, and speak to
each man gentylly.

I can not say nay but y^ is very troth. How be yt every man has not like
wit nor like inuencyon in writing. For he fyndeth many proper ways of
vtterynge evil matter in good words, which I never thought upon, but am a
simple plain body much like the Macedonyes, for whom Plutarche writes y^
king Philyppe their master made a reasonable excuse.

For when they were in y^ war some of their enmyes fled fro their own king
and came in to king Philyppes service against their own country. with whom
when the Macedonyes fell some time at words, as it often happeth among
souldyours / the Macedonyes in spyght would call them traitors. wheruppon they
complained to king Philyppe, and made the matter ^ore and greuouse / that where
as they had not only left their own natyue country, but did also fight
against yt and help to destroy yt, for the love and service that they bare
toward him / his own people let not in anger and in despyghte to call them
false traitors. wheruppon king Phylyp answered them. Good fellows I pray you
be not angry with my people, but have pacyence. I am sorry that their manner is
no better. But I wysse ye know them well enough / their nature is so plain,
and their vtterau^ce so rude, that they can not call an horse but an horse
they. And in good faith, like those good folk am I. For though Tyndale and
Fryth in their writing, call me a po^te / yt is but of their own courtesye,
undeserved on my part. For I can neither so myche poetry nor so myche
rethoryque neither, as to find good names for ^uyll things / but even as the
Macedonyes could not call a tray^our but a traytoure, so can I not call a fool
but a fool, nor an heretyque but an heretyque.

Some of y^ brethren said, that I should at the lest wise call friar Ba^ns by
the name of doctor, because he was authorysed and made a doctor of dyuynyte
by the university. But one answered for me to y^, and said that name was given,
to serve for y^ time in which he was mete to tech / and not now when he is not
mete to teach, but is by the church for false teaching for boden to teach.
But then unto that one of them answered again and asked, why should I then call
him friar still* while he is now no longer a friar no more then a doctor.

But unto this I could between them tell some reason of dyfference. How be yt
rather then to make this book over long, by holdyng a problem upon every
tryfle / I shall be content like as instead of doctor men call him heretyke, so
instead of friar to call him the the other name that every man calls all those
that be run out of relygyo^. ^o there have I fallen on a fair figure unware,
that is I trow called periphrasys, to void the foul name of apostata.

But now these good brethren that find the fault with me, that I speak no
fayrer unto these holy prophets of theyrs / be so egall and indyfferent, that
in them they find no fault at all for their abominable raylyng against so
many other honest honorable good and virtuous folk, nor for conde^pnynge for
damned heretyques the whole catholyque church of all christian people except
heretykes, both spyrytuall and temporal, seculare and relygyouse to.

But then y^ good brethern excuse them and say, that they write against none
but only them that are naught, and write but against their v^ces.

But this will evil defend them, when Barons writes against y^ whole clergy,
and Tindale says expressly y^ of them all there is never one good.

And also they write not so much against pomp and pride and glotony, as
against watchynge and prayeng, fasting and wylfull poverty / and all these
things in good religyouse people the heretyques abhor, and call yt but
ypocrysye.

Then rail they not so sore in words against the lay^ people / but as fair
as they flater them to make them enmyes to the clergy, yet they damn them
all to the devil, both them selves and their fathers, and their graundfathers,
and their grau^d fathers great graundfathers to. For they say that this.viii.
hundred year all the corpse of crystendome has been led out of the right way
fro god, and have lived al in idolatry, and dyed in service of y^ devil /
because they have done honor to Cristes cross, and prayed ^^to saints, and
reverenced their relyques, and honored their images, and ben baptized in
latyne, and taken matrymony for a sacrament, and used confession, and done
penance for synnys, and prayed for all christian souls, and ben aneyled in
their death bed, and have taken their housell after the ryte and usage of the
church, and have set more by y^ mass then they should do, and byleued that it
was a sacryfyce, an host, and an oblacyon, and that yt should do them good,
and have byleued that there was neither bread nor wine in the blessed sacrament
of the altar, but instead of bread and wine y^ very body and blood of
Christ. All these things say Tyndale and Barns both be very false ^ylyefe and
great damnable sin in y^ doing / and so dampne they to the devil the whole
catholyq^e church both temporal and spyritual and (except heretics) leave
not one man for gods part this.viii. hundred year paste by their own
lymytacy on / and of troth if their falls heresies were true, not in the
the other.vii. hundred before y^ neither.

Now when that against all the whole catholyke church, both that now is, and
that ever before has been from the apostles days hitherto, both temporal and
spyrytuall, ley men and relygyouse, and against all that good is, saints,
ceremonies, service of god, the very sacraments and all, and most against the
best that is to wit the precyouse body and blood of our savior him self in
the holy sacrament of the altar, these blasphemouse heretykes in their
ungracious books so vilanously ieste and rail: were not a man wene you very
far ouersene and wurthy to be compted vncourtayse, that would in writing
against their heresies, presume without great reverence to rehearse their
wurshypfull namys.

If any of them use their words at their pleasure, as evil and as vyllanouse
as they ly^te against my self / I am content to forbere any requy^ynge
thereof, and give them no wors words again then if they speak me fair / nor
^^^nge them self toward all other folk as they do, fairer words will I not
give them then if they spoke me ^owle. For all shall be one to me, or rather
the wurse the better. For the pleasant oil of heretykes cast upon mine head,
can do my mind no pleasure / but contrary wise the wurse y^ such folk
write of me, for hatered y^ they bear to the catholyke church and faith / y^
greater pleasure (as for mine own part) they do me. But surely their raylyng
against all other, I purpose not to bear so pacyentely, as to forbere to let
them here some part of like language as they speak. How be it utterly to
match them therein, I neither ca^ though I would, nor will neither though I
could / but am content (as I needs must) to give them therein the maystry,
wherein to match them were more rebuke then honestye.

Now if they excuse them self, and say they speak evil but of evil things
(for so call they good wurkes of penance, and so call they the ceremonies and
sacraments of Crystes church) I answer them plainly that they lie / wherein
every true christen man will testyfye that I say treuth / for those things be
good and holy which they rebuke and call naught. And I say ferther also, that
by y^ excuse of theyrs, they make mine excuse to, in the thing wherwyth they
be wurst content / that is to wit, where ^ sumewhat sharply rebuke wedding
of frerys and nonnys / which thing is as all the world woteth, bestely and
abomynable in deed.

And also if they will excuse them self, and say that as ^owchynge men, they
rail against none but such as be ^ewde and naught: to this I answer fy^ste
that in this thing they lie. For they rail against all. And some they call
naught by name, whose special goodness shall have reco^de and witness of all
good folk that know them. Secundly I say ferther* that by this excuse of
theyrs / they must needs excuse me to, wha^ I rebuke them self. For they be
wel^ and openly known and co^uycted for heretykes, which is ye wore well the
wo^st ^ryme that can be / and that for ^eretykes of such a manner sort, as is
the wurste kind of that crime that ever came out of chrystendome.

How be it I am yet content for all this, to fall at some reasonable
composycyo^ with them. Let us take this way between us from hense forth if
they list. Like as I do not allow but abhor incontynence in sacred professed
persons y^ have vowed chastyte / so let them confess that them self abhor
also the bestely bycherly marriages of monks freres and nonnes, and of all
such as have unto god promised and vowed the contrary. And than sith all our
matter is only of the faith / let them forbere instead of reasonyng to fall to
raylynge upon other mennys living. For thereby fleing fro the matter of faith
/ they furnysshe out their process with lyenge, wh^le the fawtes of some,
they lewdely lay to all.

If they will not (which were the best) revoke their false heresies / nor
will not (which were the next) be heretykes alone them self, and hold their
tunges and be still, but will needs be babelynge and corrupt whom they can:
let them yet at the lest wise be reasonable heretykes and honest, and write
reason and leave raylynge / and than let the brethren find the fawte with
me, if I use them not after that in words, as fair and as mylde as the matter
may suffer and bear.

But this way will they never take I wene. For t^an they se well that their
dysc^ples will never have half the lust to look upon they: books wherein they
should than find but a poor feste and an evil dressed d^^er. For in their
only raylynge stands all their revel, with only rayl^nge is all their
roste me^e bas^ed, and all there pot seaso^ed, and all their pie me^e sp^^ed,
and all their mau^che^es, (...) all ^heyr wafers, and all (...) ypocrace made.

The.x. chapyter.
NOw passing over this point / I come to this (...) good brothern say, that
they list not to read my books / for I am suspecte in these matters, and
parcyall ^o ward the spyrytualty.

As for suspecte / if I be now suspecte the world waxes all of a new kind.
For men were wont to call those folk suspecte, y^ were suspect of heresy. And
this is now a new kind of suspect^^, if me^ be now suspected of y^ catholyke
faith. How be it i^ that suspycyon am I glad to be fallen, and purpose never to
purge it.

Now as towchynge parcyalyte upon my part toward the spyry^ualtye / I marvel
whereof they gather it. My self am perde a te^porall man / and by twyse wedding
am come in the case that I can never be priest. And for as all y^ lands and
fees that I have in all England, bysyde such lands and fees as I have of the
gift of the kings most noble grace is not at this day nor shall be while my
mother in law lives (whose life and good health I pray god long keep and
continue) wurth yearly to my living the sum of full fyfty pound. And thereof
have I some by my wife, and some by my father (whose soul our lord assoyle)
and some have I also purchaced my self / and some fees have I of some
te^porall men. And then may every man well guess, y^ I have no very great
part of my living by the clergy, to make me very parcyall to them.

And over that this shall I trewly say, that of all the yearly living that I
have of the kings gracious gift / I have not one grote by the menes of any
spyritual man / but far above my deseruynge have had yt, only by his own
syngulare bountye and goodness, and specyal favor toward me.

And verily of any such yearly fees as I have to my lyui^g at this of any other
/ I have not had one grote granted me sith I first wrote, or went about to
write my dialoge / and that was ye wot well the first work that I wrote in
these matters.

But then say the brethern as their holy father writes, and tells also
diverse whom he talks with, that I have taken great rewards in ready money of
diverse of theclergy for making of my books.

In good faith I will not say nay, but that some good and honorable men of
them, would in reward of my good wy^l and my labor against these
heretyques, have given me myche more then ever I did, or could deserve. But I
dare take god and them also to record, that all they could never feffe me
with one penny thereof / but (as I plainly told them) I would rather have cast
their money into the Temys. then take yt. For all be it they were as in deed
there were, both good men and honorable / yet look I for my thank of god that
is their better, and for whose sake I take the labor and not for theyrs.

And if any of the brethern byleuyng their holy fathers, think as some of them
say, that I have more advantage or these matters then I make for / and that I
set not so little by money as to refuse yt when yt were offered: I will not
myche dispute with them longer upon the matter. But let them believe as they
list / yet this will I be bold to say for my self, all though they should call
me pharysye for the boste and pelagiane for my labor to, that how bad so ever
they reken me, I am not yet fully so vertulesse, but that of mine own natural
dysposycyon without any special peculyare help of grace thereto, I am ^othe
over proud and over slothful also, to be hired for money to take half the
labor and business in writing, that I have taken in this gere synnys I began.

And therefore cause of parcyal favor to the prestes persons have I none, more
then has every good christian man and woman / which is of dewty bounden to give
honor and reverence unto that holy sacrament of order, with which the clergy
is specially consecrate and dedycate unto god.

But where as the brethern say that I am not indyfferent in the matter / therein
do they the thing that they seldom do that is to wit say y^ truth. For if
they call the matter either the vice or virtue of the persons, which I take
not for y^ matter: yet therein am I not indifferent in deed between a temporal
man and a spyrytuall. For as for vice, I hold yt myche more dampnable in a
spyrytuall person then in a temporal man. And as for virtue / egall virtue I
hold yt yet myche more if yt happen in the temporal man the^ in the
spyrytuall / because though the thing be egall, they be not both egally bound
thereto. And therefore if they take this for y^ matter / in this wise I am not
indyfferent.

Now if they take for the matter the thing that I take for the matter, that is
to wit y^ true faith and false heresies / then* am I much less indyfferent.
For god keep me from being indyfferent between those two sorts. For every
good man is bounden betrwene truth and falshed, the catholyque church and
heretykes, between god and the devil, to be parcyall / and plainly to declare
him self to be full and whole upon the tone side and clear against the the other.

But else as for any parcyal favor that I bear to the clergy, whereby do
these brethern prove yt? I never said that they were all fauteles, nor I never
excused their fautes. And if ever I did / let the^^ rehearse of my writing
some one place at the least, let them tell where I commend pomp and pride,
where I praise auaryce, where lechery, or such other thing.

Those that be spyrytuall persons by professyon, and are therwyth carnal and
wreched in their condicyon, have never ben favored by me.

when I was first of the kings counsel, and after his under treasorer, and
in y^ time while I was chau^celler of his duchye, of Lancaster, and when I was
his chau^cellour of this realm / yt was metely well known what manner of
favor I bare toward the clergy / and that as I loved and honored the good,
so was not remysse nor slack in prouydynge for the correccyon of those that
were naught, noyouse to good people, and slaunderouse to their own order.
which sort of prestes and religyouse runnynge out of relygyon and falling
to theft and murder, had at my hand so little favor, that there was no man
that any meddling had with them, into whose hands they were more lo^he to come.

And in this point found I their ordinaryes so well minded to their amendeme^t
and correccyon / y^ they gave me great thanks therefore.

And I found those prestes rather content to remain in the kings pryso^s a
mon^th, then in the bishops a weke / saving for hope of delyueraunce by the
comen course of their purgacyon.

And yet as far as my pore wit could give me, saving that the danger of
escapes is to the ordinary so chargeable, that y^ fere thereof makes them
feign of their delyueraunce / else were they lykely to be waxen better ere
they gate thense, or else to tarry there as long as ever they lived.

But I perceive well that these good brethern look that I should rebuke the
clergy, and seek out their fawtes, and lay them to their facys, and write some
wurke to their shame / or else they can not call me but parcyall to the
prestes.

How be it by this reason they may call me parcyall to the lay men to. For I
never used that way neither toward the tone nor y^ the other. I find not yet
such plenty and store of virtue in my self, as to think it a metely part
and conuenyent for me to play, to rebuke as abomynable vycyouse folk, any one
honest company either spyrytuall or temporal / and much less mete to rebuke
and reproach either the whole spyrytualtye or te^poraltye, because of such as
are very stark naught in both.

I dare be bold to say tha^ proud folk be naught, that couetouse folk be
naught, y^ lecherouse folk be naught / and to speak against open known
theuys, open known murderers, open known per^ured persons, open known
apostatase, open known professed or co^uycted heretykes. But surely my guise
is not to lay the fawtes of y^ noughty, to the charge of any whole company /
and rail upon merchauntes and call them usurers / nor to rail upon france^s
and call the^ false iurrours / nor to rail upon shyryffes and call them
rauenours / nor to rail upon eschetours and call them extorcioners / nor upon
all officers and call them ^rybours / nor upon gentyl^men and call them
oppressors / nor so forth up higher, to call every degree by such odyouse
names as men might find some of that sort.

And of all degrees specially for my part, I have ever accounted my dewty to
forbere all such manner of unmannerly byhauour toward those two most emynent
orders, that god has here ordained in earth / the two great orders I mean of
special consecrate personys, the sacred princes and prestes. Against any of
which two reverent orders, who so be so lewd vnreuerentely to speak, and
malapertly to ieste and rail, shall play that part alone for me. And rather
will I that these brethren call me parcyall, than for such ill fasshyon
indyfferent.

And over this I can not se what need there were that I should rail upon the
clergy, and reken up all their fawtes.

For that part has Tyndall played, and friar Barns both al^redy / and left
no thing for me to say therein, not though my mind were sore set thero^.

They have with treuth and lies together, laid y^ living of badde, to badde
and good both, in such a vile vy^anouse fasshyon, that it would make a good
stomach to vomyte to here they^e rybauldouse raylynge. And yet not against the
sacred persons only, but against the blessed sacraments also.

And now would their dyscyples that I should not speak against their execrable
heresies, and their dispyghtful dealing / but if I should by the way do as
they do, and help them forth in the same.

And* herein fare they much like, as if there were a sort of vilayne wreched
heretics that metynge the prestes and (...) relygyouse and other (...) with
baners, copys, crosses, and sencers, and the (...) borne about with (...) upon
a corpus chrysty day, wo^d pyke quareilys to them, and first call them all
that could come in their vyllayne mouths, and happily say true by some /
and than ^ache them all by the heddys, and throw them in the mire, surplyces,
copys* sensers, crosses, relyques, sacrament and all. And than if any man
rebuked their vilanouse dealing, and would step unto the prestes, and puile
them up and help to wype the copys, and reuere^tly take up the crosses, the
relykes, and the blessed sacrament: were it not now well and wisely spoken if
one would* reprove him that thus did, and say he should not meddle him self in
the matter hot nor co^lde, but if he would be indyffere^t and do some what on
both the sides / and therefore he should to show him self indy^^ere^t, either
reuyle and rebuke the prestes, or at the least wise some of them / and sowse
them somewhat in the mire for the pleasure of them that so served them / or
else go by about his other busynes, and let the matter alone / and neither
take up good man out of the mire, nor surplyce, cope, nor sencer, nor rel^ke
/ but let them lay the sacrament in the dyrt again. were not this a goodly
way? Surely for my part I am not so ambycyouse of such folks praise, as to
be called indyfferent, will in writing against their heresies help them forth
in their raylynge.

The.xi. chapyter.
BUt now where as the brethren lay a blame in me, that I had not used such
a goodly mylde manner, and such an indyfferent fasshyon, as they find used by
him that made the book of the dyuysyon between the spyrytualty and the
temporalty: I am not greatly blame worthy therein. For his book was put out
sins / and therefore could I when I wrote take none ensample thereof / and
every man is not like inue^tyue of his own wit. For surely he has founden some
certain proper invented fygures in that book, in which I am so far from
finding the like of my self, that being as they now be founden to mine hand
all ready, hard were it for me in the like matter to follow them.

And yet though my books be very far under his / they may be for all that (ye
wot well) metely good, if his be so far excellent as the brethern boste yt.
In which book yet as much as they boste yt / he declares and expressly
testyfyeth like a true christian man, how so ever the matters go between the
temporaltye and the spyrytualty, that yet their opynyons are heresies.

But they take as it seems all those words of his well in worth, because they
reken the^ self recompensed in a another part, in that they falsely persuade
unto them self, either that he dyssymuleth for the while and byleueth as they
do / or else that believe he never so well him self, yet either of pytye or
some other affection, he could be content to help, that they should them
self with their evil bylyefe be let alone and live in rest, and be sufferd
to believe as they list.

But I trust in god that in that point they lene to much to the letter of his
words, and of their own favor to them self, mysse constre the good mannys
mind. For god forbede that any cryste^ man should mean so.

How be yt as touching y^ matter wherwyth we be now in hand, that is to wit
the manner of mylde and indyfferent writing by me or by him concerning the
spyrytualty and the te^poralty / therein am I very sure that his myld
indyfferent book of the dyuysyon, neither is more myld nor more indyffere^t
then any book of mine.

For first as for mine own part, look my dyaloge, my supplycacyon of souls,
and both the parts of the confutacyon / and ye shall clearly se y^ I neither
have used toward the clergy nor toward the temporalty, any warm dyspleasaunt
word / but have forborne to touch in special either the fautes of the tone or
of the the other. But yet have I confessed the thing y^ troth is / neither part
to be fautlesse. But then which is the thing that offe^deth these blessed
brethren / I have not let forthermore to say the thing which I take also
for very true / that as this realm of england has had hitherto god be
thanked as good and as laudable a temporalty, number for number, as has had
any other christian region of the qua^tyte / so has it had also number for
number compared with any realm cristened of no gretter quantyte, as good and
as commendable a clergy / though there have never lacked in any of both the
parts, plentye of such as have always be naught / whose fautes have ever ben
their own, and not to be imputed to the whole body neither of spyrytualty nor
te^poralty / saving that there have been peradventure on either part, in some
such as by their offices ought to look thereto, some lack of the labor and
dylyge^ce that in the reformynge of yt should have belonged unto them, which I
declare always that I would wyshe amended, and every man specially labor to
me^de him self / and rather accustom him self to look upon his own fautes
then upon other men's / and against such as are in either sort founden
^pen, evil, and naught, and noyouse unto the comenwell, as theuys, murderers,
and heretyques, and such other wreches / the whole corpse of the spyrytualty and
temporaltye both, each with other louyngly to accord and agree / and
according to the good ancient laws and commendable vsages long continued in
this noble realm, either part endeavor them self dylygently to repress and
keep under those evil and ungracious folk, that like sores, scabbes, and
cankers, trouble and vex the body / and of all them to cure such as may be
cured, and for health of the whole body, cut and cast of the incurable
cancred parts there fro / observed in the doing evermore such order and
fasshyon as may stand and agree with reason and justice, the kings laws of the
realm, the scripture of god, and the laws of Crystes church / ever keeping
love and concord between the two pryncypall parts the spyritualty and
temporalty, lest the dregs of both sorts conspyryng to gether and
encreasyng, may little and little grow to strong for both / whereto they might
have a fair gappe and a broad gate to enter, if they might find the mean by
craft to sever and set a sunder the temporalty against y^ clergy to strive,
and so let as yt were the soul and the body brable and strive to gether / and
while they study nothing else but the tone to grieve the the other, the noughty
then conspyre and agree to gether, and set upon the good people of both.

This has been hitherto the whole sum of my writing, without any
dyspleasaunt word used either toward temporaltye or spyrytualtye. And more
mylde manner then this toward al good folk, has not this other book of
dyuysyon, nor yet a more indyfferent as far as I can se / but if he be
rekened more myld, because he sets his words much more myld and cold when
he speaks awght of heretics, and shows him self therein more temperate and
thereby more dyscrete then I / and but if he be ^ekened for more indyfferent,
because his words i^ rehersyng the fawtes of the spyritualty, be not in the
wurste things parcyally poynted toward such as be naught, but indy^fere^tly
dyrected and poynted toward the whole body.

The.xii. chapyter.
HOw be it as towching the manner of his handelynge / to tell you the very
troth, it seems to me some what strange, for one that would go about the
purpose that he pretends, that is to wit to pacyfye and appease two
parties, being at so sore a dyssensyon and dyuysyon, as he says that y^
temporalty is in grudge against the spyrytualty, not here and there but every
where noted, as he says in a manner universally through this whole realm. How
be it I trust in god very far fro so. And yet not fully so far, but that it
may by mysfortune for abundance of sin and lake of grace, in time grow and
come to it.

For troth it is that murmur and dyssensyon (god knows how it begone)
against the clergy is a great way gone onward in his unhappy journey / and
may by such manner and mean of pacyfyenge, within short process be conuayed
round about the realm, and leave no place in peace. Not y^ I would think the
man that made that book to be of such malycyouse mind, as wyllyngly to sow
dyssensyon / but that as me seems he takes at the lest wise unware a wrong
way toward the contrary / and that the manner of his handelynge is far from
such indyffere^cye as he should use, that would make a love day and appease any
murmur and grudge of the lay people against the prestes.

For he shows in the progress of all his process, that the grudge is borne
by the te^poraltye / and the causes and occasions thereof grown and given in
effect all by the spyrytualtye* which handelyng is not as me thinks very
myche indyfferent.

I let pass that he which verily would entende to pacyfye, swage, and
appease a grudge, would (as myche as he conuenyentely might) extenuate the
causes and occasions of the grudge. But and if he would needs walk plainly
forth and take no such bye ways / he would not yet at the least wise not
accumulate and exaggerate the greuys, and by all the means he might, make y^
greues appear many, great, and most odyouse. Or finally, if for hatered of
their fawtes, no favor of their persons could cause him to forbere that / yet
would he forbere at the least wise to seek up and rehearse causes of grudge
before unknown unto the party, whose dyspleasure he would assuage and
pacyfye. But now this appeasoure contrary wise, not only does in all these
things the contrary / but brings forth also bysyde all this, some such
fautes mo, as if they were true were of the greatest weyghte / and tells
them as though they were tr^we, where they be very plain false in deed.

But now the good brethren that boste it, lay forth for a great token of
temperaunce and good mind toward the spyrytualty, that he forbereth to speak
any thing of y^ great open fawtes that many prestes be openly taken in / as
theft, robbery, sacrilege, and murder / whereof in soundry shyres of the
realm there are at every sessyons openly fou^den some.

And yet the most part of such fawtes as he speaks of, he says the^ not as
of him self, nor affermeth them not for true* nor as things neither spoken by
the mouths of very many / but to mytygate the matter with, he says no more but
that thus by the clergy some say, and some find this fawte with them, and
some find that / and though that many small sommes make a great, what can he
do thereto? can he let men to speak? or is he bound to stop his earys and
here them not? or may he not tell what he hears some other say?

And yet say they ferther, that he tells indyfferentely the fawtes as well
of the temporalty as of the spyritualty / and would there should not be between
the temporaltye and the spyrytualtye, so myche as any one angry word. And
therefore they say that it can not be possible that he wrote of any evil
entente, sith no man can use him self neither more myldely nor with more
indyfference, nor finally with more tender cheryte.

But now to these excuses, some other men answer again, that the leuyng out
of felonye, sacrylege, and murder, is rather a token of wylynes the^ any
forbering or favor. For sith he saw well y^ every wise man would answer in
him self, that those great horrible open euyls of such desperate noughty
wreches, were not to be laid against the clergy / as the like in temporal
wreches are not to be laid against the te^poralty: he would therefore rather
seek out and hepe up a sort of those things that might by his manner of
handelynge, sown in the readers ears to be such as the temporaltye might
ascrybe and impute unto (and therefore bear a gruge unto) the main multitude of
the whole clergy, and extend in substance unto every part.

And as touchy^ge that* he says not the things as of him self, but brings
them in with a figure of Some say: to that point some other say, that for that
curtesy no man has any cause to can him any thank. For under his fair figure
of some say / he may ye wot well, and some say that he so does, deuyse to
bring in all the myschyefe that any man can say. And yet over this without
his masker of Some say / he says open faced some of the wurste him self, and
that in some things y^ are as some true men say not true.

Then as touching his indyfferency, in telling the fautes of y^ te^poralty to
/ of troth among a great hepe of shrewd fautes rehearsed against the clergy,
for which the temporalty might if the things were all true, seem to have
great cause of grudge / he reherseth also some fautes of y^ temporalty to, as
that they be to blame because they use the prestes over familyarely, and give
them over gay gowns or light colored lyuereys, and one or two such things
(...) as though they might (...) mended, yet were of no such kind as the
prestes that so be ^elte with all, have been wont to find any cause (...).

How be yt yet in one place to show his farther indyffe^ency / he lays
against them both that the prestes against lay people, and lay people
against prestes, have used to have evil language / and either against other
to speak unsitting words. And there upon she shows his tender charity, and
says: If all these words were prohybyted on both sides ^ppon great payne^, I
think y^ would do great good in this behalf.

The.xiii. chapyter.
BUt now good readers if that yt so were, that one ^ounde two men sta^dyng to
gether, and would come step in between them, and ber^ them in hand they were
about to fight / and would with that word put the tone prete^^ back with his
hand, and all to buffer the the other about the face / and then go forth and say
that he had parted a fray, and pacyfyed the parties: some men would say again
(as I suppose) that he had as lyu^ his enmy were let alone with him, and thereof
abide the adventure, as have such a friend step in between to part them.

How be it if this pacyfyer of this dyuysyon will say that this is nothing like
the present matter, because he stryketh neither part, but only tells the
tone y^ tothers fautes / or else (as he will say) tells the^ their fautes
both: if yt so happeth good readers he found a man that were angry with his
wife (and happily not all without cause) if this maker of the book of dyuys^on
would take upon him to go and reconcyle them again to gether / and help to
make them at one / and therein would use this way, that when he had them both
before him and before all their neighbors to, then saving for some chaung to
make yt met^ for their persons, ^lles he would begin holyly with y^ same
words in effect with which he begins his indifferente mylde book of
dyuy^ion / and for an enter into his matter first would say thus unto them /
who may remember the state that ye stand in, without great heuenesse and sorrow
of heart? For where as in times passed has reigned between you cherite, mekenes
co^^orde, and peace / there reygneth now anger, and malice, de^ate, dyuysyon
and strife. which thing to se so mysfortune between any two christian folk, is
a thing myche to be lamented / and then myche more to be lamented, when yt
myshappeth to fall between a man and his wife. And many good neighbors greatly
marvel I wysse, upon what causes this great grud^e is gro^en. And therefore
^o chente^t that ye man r^moue y^ causes and amend these matters, and thereby
then by the gra^e of god agree / I will tell you what I here men say that the
causes be. And now after holy prologe made / go forth and tell them that some
folk say, the wife has this evil condycyon, and some other say that she
has that evil condicyon, and yet other some say that she has a another evil
condycyon / and so with twenty diverse some says of other me^, say there him
self by the pore woman, all the mychyefe that any man could dyuyse to say / and
among those, some things peradventure true, which yet her husband had never
herd of before. And some things false also / whereof because y^ pacyfyer would
be put unto no proof, he would not sa^ them as of him felf but bring the^ forth
under y^ fair figure of some say. And when he had all said then yet at the
last say thus much of him self. As for these things here and there I have
herd some other say / whether they say true or no the charge be theyrs for
me. But yet in good faith good ^yster, sith ye know that the dyspleasure and
grudge that your husband has to you, is grown upon these causes / I
marvel much my self that you do use the same condycions still. I wysse till
you meke your self and amend them, this anger of your husband will never be
well appeased.

Lo with such words he voydeth the color of his fair figure of Some say,
either by forgetfulness, or else by the plain figure of folly. For when he says
of him self, that she keeps those evil condycyons still and amendeth them not
/ he shows y^ all his Some says be of his own saying, though he might
happily in some of them here some other say so to bysyde.

But than if among all these fawtes so my^dely rehearsed against her, he would
to show somewhat of his indyfferencye, tell her husband his pars verse to / and
say, But yet forsothe your wyf^ has not given you so many causes of
dyspleasure for naught. For I will be play^ with you and indyfferent between
you both, you have (...) some things toward her not delte very well nor like
a good husband your self.

For this I know my self* that ye have used to make her to homely with you,
and have suffered her to be to (...) idle, and suffered her to be to ^yche
co^^ersaunt among her gosseppys, and you have given her over gaye gere and to
much money in her purse / and surely till you mende all this gere for your
part, I can not myche marvel though she do you dyspleasure. And sometime
evil words between you causes debate on both sides. For you call her (as I
here say) cursed queen and shrew / and some say that she byhynde your back
calls you knave and cuckolde. And I wysse such words were well done to be
left on both sides / for surely they do no good. And therefore if all the^e
words were prohybyted on both sides upon great pains, I think it would do
great good in this byhalfe.

Now get you hense as wife as a calfe would I wene the good wife say to this
good goostely pacyfyer. For spoke he never so myldely, and would seem never so
indyfferent / though he looked therewyth right simply, and held up also both
his hands holyly, and would therewith swear to the woman full depely, y^ his
intent were good, and that he nothing mente but to bring her husband and her
at one / would she think you for all that believe him? I suppose verily nay,
nor her husband neither if he were wise, all though he saw some part of his
tale true / as none is so folysshe to say all false, that would win him
credence. But believe the husband as he list / I durst be bold to swear for
the wife, that he should never make her such a fool, as to believe that he meant
to mende the matter, with rehersynge her fawtys mo then ever her husband had
herd of, and some of them false to / and than color all his tale with his
proper inuencio^ of Some say. But she would for his some say shortly sai to hi^,
I pray you good man Some say get you shortly hense. For my husband and I
shall agree myche the sooner if no such brother Some say come within our door.

Now of very troth this pacyfyer, as some say, goth yet wurse to wurke i^ his
book of dyuisyon, then this Some say, that we put for a sample between the man
and his wife. For he gathers first all the causes of dyspleasurys that he can
find out or dyuyse / and diverse of them such as few ley people unlearned, ye
and few of the learned to, had any thing herd of before, as are diverse of
those which he gathers out of John^ Gerson.

If he say that he meant as Gerson did, that he makes mencyon of them because
he would have the clergy mende them / surely who so for such good will tells
a man his ^^wtes, uses to tell hit him secretly / and so did John^ Gerson him
self when he wrote them in latyne, and not in the vulgar tunge.

But this pacyfyer co^trarywyse because he would have the lay people both men
and women look on them, does translate them into englysh / where as John^
Gerson would not that a man should reproach and rebuke y^ prelates before the
people.

Also this pacyfyer aggreueth (as much as i^ him lies) the clergy of
england, for use of the laws not made by them self, but be the common lawys
of all chrystendome.

If he will say that he blames but their abuses thereof the troth appears in
some place otherwise in his book. And yet sith he proves that point but by a
some say / he might with the same figure lay like fawtes in the temporaltye
concerning the laws of this realm, and prove it in like wise with a great
Some say to. And therein he shows him self not indyfferent when he brings
in the tone and leueth the the other out. And on the the other side, if he bring in
the the other to / tha^ shall he make two fawtes for one. For if he handle them as
truly as he handeleth these / than shall he make two lies for one.

And yet bysyde all the fawtes that he brings in under some say and they say
/ some that him self says without any some say, be such as some say that he
can never prove, and some they say be plain and open false.

By all which manner of handelynge it appears, that if the man mean well him
self (as by gods grace he does) than has some other sotle shrew that is of
his counsel deceived him, not only in the mysse framynge of his matter more
toward diuysyo^ then unity, but also by causynge him to plant in here and
there, some such word as might make his best friends to fere, that he
greatly forced not for the furtherau^ce of the catholyke faith.

The.xiiii. chapyter
BUt for as much as the touching of y^ book is here not my pri^cipal purpose /
I will therefore not peruse it over and touch every poi^t thereof. which if I
would, I could I think well made men se, y^ very few parts thereof had
either such cherite or such indiffere^cye ^herin, as not only the new naughty
bretherhed bosteth, but some good folk also take yt at a superfycyall redynge.

And yet because y^ bretherns boste has made yt an incyde^t unto my matter /
and that some things therein are such, as yt is more then necessary that men
be well aduysed of them, and well fore se what they do in them / and lest a
better opypynyon of the book then the matter may bear (if yt be pondered right)
may be occasyon to move me^ in some great things to do no little wrong / and
to then^^nt also that ye may se y^ in all that I have said, I bylye him not: I
shall for a sample of handlynge, touch by the way one or two places of his.

And le^te folk should think that I pyke out here and there two or three lines
of y^ wurst: I will take his first chapter whole. In which though all be not
naught, nor all false (For a very fool were he that would putforth a book and
make all naught and all false, even in y^ very fore front that shall come
first to hand) yet if yt be considered and aduysed well / there will I wene
even in the very first chapyter appear, less good and less treuth to, then
men at a sudden shyft in the first redyng over, do thoroughly perceive. Lo thus
yt begins.

Who may remember the ^tate of thy^ realm now in these days, without great
heuyne^ and sorrow of heart: For there as in times pas^e has ^eygned charity,
mekene^, concord, and peace, reygneth n^w envy, pride, ^yuysyon, and ^^ry^e:
and that not only between lay men and lay men, but also between r^lygyons and
relygyons, and als^ ^etwene pre^^es and religyon^, and that is yet more to be
lamented, also between prefi^^ and pre^^es.

Some say y^ a man might here a little lament this mannys wit, that weneth yt
less to be lamented, that debate and strife should be between prestes and
religyouse persons, or between those that are both the parties relygyouse
folk, the^ between those y^ are both the parties prestes. For some say that
many relygyouse folk be prestes. And they y^ so say / do say also that as many
prestes be relygyouse folk. And some say therefore, that except this man mean
here by relygyouse folk either women or children, with whose varyaunce the
temporalty is not very greatly cu^bred / or else the lay brethren that are
in some places of religyo^, which are neither so many nor so myche esteemed,
that ever the temporalty was myche troubled with their strife: else bysyde
these there falls no variau^ce lightly between religyouse and relygyouse,
wherewith the temporalty have been offended / but yt falls of necessyte between
prestes and prestes / and the^ the varyau^ce, namely such a varyaunce as this
book speaks of, that is so notable that the temporalty so much marketh it, and
has so great cause to lament yt, when yt falls between relygyouse and
relygyouse, is a thing no less lamentable then if yt fell between as many
prestes when them self be both prestes.

And then if he mean here by prestes, those that are seculare prestes, as by
his other words he seems to do / and so takes yt for a thing more to be
lamented, if varyaunce fall between seculare prestes then between those prestes
y^ are in relygyo^: then say some men that he says somewhat worse. And then
they y^ so say, seem to me to say true. For all be it great pitye yt is to se
strife and variau^ce fall between any seculare prestes: yet is it more pitye to
se it fall between those prestes that have also vowed and professed farther,
somewhat a more straight renouncyng of all such manner thing, as matter of debate
and strife do comenly spring upon. And therefore this manner of encreace and
growing of this mannys oracyon, is but a cou^terfeted figure of rethoryque as
some men say.

And in good faith as for my self I se not the reason that moved him. For it
were ^ very cold skuse to a man learned that will way the hole periodus
together, if he would hereafter say that he meant by these words between prestes
and prestes, the prestes that are in relygyon. For bysyde that a man may by
dyuers^ things well perceive the contrary / he had if he so had mente, left
than no lamentacyon for any strife that happeth between seculare prestes among
them self. I can not therefore i^ good faith divine, what he should mean by
that increase ending in prestes after all the relygyouse, but if he mente to
sygnyfye that the state of prestes pofessyng relygyon, were a state of less
perfeccyon by reason of the professyon, then is the state of those seculare
prestes y^ have temporal lands of their own purchase or enheritau^ce, or that
else serve some chau^tery or live upon tr^ntallys abroad.

And surely if the man thus meant in deed / bysydes that he should have set
out his sentence more plainly: his menynge wyl^ but if he declare it the
better, mysselyke better men and better learned to, tha^ I and he be both. And
saving for that point which is no small matter / else as for his rules of
rethoryke or grammatycall congruyte either, or oversight in reasonyng, as
things of no great weight and would not myche vouchsaue to towche. For they be
such offenses as a man may fall in, and yet be a saved soul, as well as
though he never wrote any wurke at all

The.xv. chapyter.
Which dyuysyon has been so universal, that it has been a great unquietness
and a great breche of charity through all the realm: and pa^te of y^ has
risen by reason of a great syngularyte, that relygyous person^ and pre^^es have
(...) to their siate of living, whereby many of the^ have thought their state
mo^^e perfyte before all other. and some of them have thereby e^alted them
self in their own syghte so high, that they have risen into such a (...)
pride, that they have in manner disdayned and despised other, that have not
lived in such perfeccyon, as they think they do. And of this has followed,
that some of them have had unsitting words of the other, calling them
flatterers, dy^^^mulers, and hypocrytes: And they have called the other again
proud persons, covetous, vain gloryo^se, and lovers of wordely delytes, and
such other.

Of some partyculare varyaunce among diverse persons of the clergy have I
diverse times herd / as sometime one person against an other for his tithes /
or a person against a relygyouse place for medelynge within his parysshe / or
one place of relygyon with another upon some such like occasyon / or sometime
some one relygyon have had some questyon and dysputed as it were a problem,
upon thantyquyte or senyoryte of their ^^stytucio^, as by which the
carmelytes claim to fetch their orygynall from Helias and Helizeus. And some
question has aryse^ in y^ order of saint Francisce, between the obseruauntes
and conue^tuallys. For as for the third company that is to wit the cole^ams,
there are in this realm none. But yet of all these matters was there never as
far as I read or remember, in this realm either so very great or so many
such things all in hand at onys, that ^uer it was at the time noted through
the realm and spoken of for a great notable fawte of the hole clergy. And as
for y^ faw^es of some party culare partys either persons or placys, is nothing
that ought of reason be rekened for the cause of this diuysyo^, and of this
dyspleasure and grudge of the temporaltye (...) the clergy / no more than many
mo varyaunces growing daily in diverse times and places, with unlawful
assembles and great ryottes also* cause the clergy to grudge against the
temporalty. And as it is not reason that it so were / so that it is not in deed
may well be perceived by this. For if it were / then must this grudge of ours
against them have been a very old thing / where as it is in deed neither so
great as this man makes it, and grown to so great as it is, but even of late
syn^e Tindals books and Frythes and friar Barons began to go abroad. And yet
all though that it appears well in his words afterward, that those varyau^ces
canbe no part or cause of this diuisyon whereof he makes his book: yet has it
delyted either him self or some sotle shrewes y^ so have set him a wurke to
bring them in to* of a good mind and a favorable, to lay these fawtes to y^
clergyes face, bysyde the matter of this dyuysyon that he takes in hand to
treat of.

Now the remanau^t (whereby somewhat appear thalso, that by the encreace of his
oracyo^, with putting in the end, and that is yet more to be lamented also
between prefies and prefies, he meant to put for the more lamentable strife,
that variau^ce which falls between seculare prestes, then that that falls
between those that bysyde their order of prestehed, have by their holy vowys
entered into relygyon) he handeleth here in such wise that he first reprocheth
both the partys of great syngularyte, which both relygyouse persons and
also prestys have had to their statys of living / by which words he shows,
that each of them contend with other upon the perfeccyon of their two states
whyther should have preemynence, these prestes that are seculare or those that
are relygyouse / and which of the both him self takes for the chyef
appears, by the pytuouse increase and growing of his lamentable oracyon.

Then rebukes he of y^ relygyouse, some that have apparaunce to be the most
perfyte and best / and says, that through the great syngularyte that they have
to their state of living, they have exalted them self in their own sight so
high, that they have risen into such a go^iely pride, that they have in manner
dysdayned and despised other, that have not lived in such pe^feccyon, as they
think they do.

This is a great thing spoken by guess, because among many good virtuous
folk, there may fall some by the deuyls means into some great gostely pride,
as Lucyfer did in y^ good company of angels. But this chance of such
change is so old, that these words will nothing serve his lamentable
beginning / which stands ye wot well in lamenting the change from the
old virtues of times passed, into the new vices of this time present. And this
vice is very old, and reigned most when relygyouse folk lived best. And
verily the clergy is not all thing so evil as he makes yt, if y^ relygyouse
folk live now so holyly, as the temporalty may note that through perfytnes of
living, the devil bring so many to such an high spyce of pride.

But then goth he sorth and sets the^ to chyde to gether. How be it his
words be so confounded with they and them and other / and in the two versys of
their chydyng his words be so vnsewtely sorted, that I ca^ not perceive which
of the t^o parts calls which nor who calls whom, by those names that he
says the ^one sort calls y^ the other / nor him self I suppose neither, as
the thing that he never knew for true, but thinks he may boldly tell every
thing for true, that any man perceyueth possible.

The.xvi. chapyter.
ANd an other part of this dyuisyon has ^ysen by dyuersyties of opynyons,
that have been upon the authoryties, powers and (...) on of spyrytuall men
among them self. And upon these dyuysyons ^ome lay men have in time paste
favored the ^ne (...) / and some the other: whereby the people have greatly be
inquieted.

Diverse opynyons upon powers, authoryties, and iurysdyc^yo^s of spyrytuall men
among them self, there happens I think now and then to rise, while in
such cases either par^e has his opynyo^ upon his own side. But of any great
inquyetacyon that y^ people has had by any such dyuysyon risen within this
realm / or of any lay men beryng their favor some to the tone part and some
to the the other, I wene the people of this realm that fe^t yt have forge ten yt,
if any such were yt is so long a go. And surely my self remember none, nor I
trow no man else for the ^yme of this.xx. year / within which time or ten
fewer, all this gere is bego^ne whereof he makes his dyuysyon. And therefore
this pyece of his is to my ^^lynge very could.

The.xvii. chapyter.
But I wot not fully by what o^ casyon yt is, that now of late the great
(...) of all the lay people have found defaulte / as well at prestes as
religyous, so farreforth that yt is now in manner noted through all the realm,
that there is a great dyuysyon between the spyrytualtye and the temporaltye.
And verily yt is great pytye, that such a noise should spryng and go abroad.

In the beginning he said that dyuysyon reygneth now between spyrytuall men and
spyrituall me^. And then says he here: But it reygneth now between spyrytuall
men and temporal men.

I am content to let his but alone, and will not shote there at for this ones.
How be yt surely his but being a preposycyon aduersatyue, stands more
properly to shote at between his two nowes, then yt would if yt were turned
into some co^iunccyon copulatyue.

But where as he ca^ not fully tell by what occasyon the great multitude have
found defaute, as well at prestes as religyous / a man needs never to study
for occasyons thereof / but if he be so curyouse as to seek for fautes, he may
sone find enough, not only in prestes and in relygyous, but in every sort and
kind of temporal people to, and ever might yet in every age sith crystendome
began, and may peradventure if he search well, find some in him self to. So
y^ if there be no another cause of varyaunce then that / they may both
spiritualty and temporalty take each other by the hand like good fellows, and
agree to gether well enough.

But yet happeth yt well that this good pacyfyer has so great pytye, that the
noise of this diuisyon should spryng and go abroad. For he to remedy that matter
with all, and to pull back the noise thereof, and to stop up clearly the
spring / because all should be hushte and never mo words made thereof, has as
ye se put yt out abroad in prent.

The.xviii. chapter.
ANd some allege diverse ca^ses why yt should be so noysed.

A very few folk may sone begin a noise of evil will and malice. And a
noise may sone be borne abrod what so ever y^ matter be, with some of
symplicite, some of light geuynge credence, and some of a lust unto talkyng.

First they say, that neither pref^es nor religyouse ke^e the perfeccyo^ of
their order to the honor of god and good example of the people, as they shuld^
do.

Ueryly they that so say, peradventure say not myche untrue. For I think
that every mannys dewty toward god is so great, that very few folk serve him
as they should do. And therefore who so prye upon every mannys deed so narowly,
as to spy that fault and fall at variau^ce of great zele with every man that
does not to the very point and perfeccyo^, even all that he should do / shall
wax within a while at varyau^ce with every man and every man with him. But I
suppose they keep it now at this day, much what after such a good metely mean
manner, as they did many of those years before in which this dyuysyon was never
dremed on. And therefore they that say this is the cause / have need to go seek
some other.

But that some of them procure their own honor, and call yt the honor of
god, and rather coueyt to have rule over the people then to profit the people.

were there never none of these till now so late as about the beginning of
this dyuysyon / or be they all such now? Among Crystes own apostoles was some
desire of prelacye, and that with some contencyon to. There are of our
prelates some such at this day now, as I pray god that when there shall any new
come, they may prove no wurse. For of these wha^ they dye if they wax not
wurse before / who so shall live after the^, may in my mind be bold to say,
that england had not their better any day this.xl. year, and I durst go a
good way above to. But this is more by twenty year and ten set thereto, then
this diuysio^ has any thing be spoken of.

And that some covet their bodyly ease and worldly wealth, in meat and drink,
and such other, more then commenly any temporal man does.

This is a very cold cause of this new dyuysyon, to say that there be not now
come^ly so badde men in the temporaltye as there be some in the spirytualtye.
For when was it otherwise? not even in Crystes own days. For Judas that was
one of his own apostles, was not only wurse then the common sort of all those
that loved their belyes and their ease among Crystes dyscyples were they men
or women / but wurse also tha^ the very wurste in all y^ world bysyde. But what
cause were this that the te^poraltye should (nor though this man say thus, I
think them not so unreasonable that they would) be at debate and dyuisyon with
the hole body of the clergy, because that some of the^ were wurse then those
are that are in a mean common sort of noughtynesse among them self.

And that some se^ue god for a wordely land and to be magni^yed therefore, more
they for the pure (...) of god.

That same some that so do, be some of the most folysh apys that the devil
has to tu^ble before him and to make him lawghe, when he sees them take so
much labor and pain for the reward of the blast of a few men's mowthes.

How be it there may be some such for all that, and yet nothing to the
purpose of this matter. For as for the speech of folys is not to be compted for
a proof of dyuysyon. And among wise men the guess and contecture that in the
clergy there be secretly some very naught before god, whom yet in the syghte
of the world men take for very good, can by no reason be the cause of any
grudge toward the spyrytualty, wherein may be bysyde them that are such and so
there are in deed, many very virtuous holy men in deed / whose holiness and
prayour has been I verily think one great special cause, that god has so
long holden his hand from geuyng of some sorer stroke upon the necks of them
y^ are naught and care not in the spyrytualty and the temporaltye both.

And yet this fawte that this pacyfyer assygneth of serving god for lawde, is
I suppose somewhat amended of late / and will within a while if some gere go
forward, were a way quyte, by the help and meanys of an other fawte.

For if these heresies that rail upon relygyons, and call all their prayour
parerynge, and all their fasting folly, and all their holy vowys of chastyte
worse then friar Lutherslechery: if these heresies I say may grow and go
forward, as they begin to grow now and prosper full pretily in some places /
and then if those that be of the same sect, and of polycy dyssymule it for a
season, may in the mean time sprede abroad an opinion in the minds of men
that of them self mean none harm, that the relygyouse people do fast and pray
but for lawde: they shall well perceive within a while, y^ they shall have so
little lawd thereof, that if there would remain none other cause of this
dyuysyon but because they serve god for lawde, ye shall have it soon changed
of lykelyh^d / and then shall we shortly agree together very well.

But now good reders consider I beseech you, that if these causes which this
pacyfyer alleges under the color of Some say, be causes that might move
the temporaltye to be in dyuysyon and grudge against the clergy / that is to
wit because they serve not god as they should do, but some of them love
authoryte and some love their case, and some serve god of vain glory for lawde
and praise of men: thanne should this dyuysyo^ not have so late bygon, but
must have ben^ ever before / and can never be remedyed hereafter, but as long
as the world lasts must this dyuysyon ever co^tynue still.

For how could this pacyfyer find the means, that in the whole clergy so
many as are therein, none should be nought^ / when of Christ's apostles there
was yet one naught in the small number of twelve. And verily in this
declynacyon of the world, and by this great fall of faith, the old fervor of
cheryte so beginning to cole: it is to be ^ered at length, that if it thus go
forth and continue, both the spyrytualtye from thapostles, and the temporaltye
from the other dysciples, may fall so far down down down down, that as
there was tha^ one naught among twelve, so may there in time coming if these
heresies go forward, among twelve spyrytuall or peradventure twenty temporal
either, be founden at last in some whole cuntre scante any one good. But y^
world is not I thank god in England yet, nor never shall I trust come.

How be it y^ all may be made good that will be hard for this pacyfyer to
deuyse the means. So that if the being of some naught may be a good cause of
dyuysyon / dyuysyon may be by sometime fewer naught, made sometime somewhat
less / but end can it never have while the world stands.

But if this pacifyer to cease and quench this dyuysyon, could find the
means to make al y^ whole clergy good: yet for all that, sith he lays for
causes of this dyuysyon, that some men say this by the clergy, and some men
say by them that / were all the clergy never so good in deed, and served god
never so well, this diuysyon by his own tale, yet could not for all that
cease / except he could provide farther, y^ no pytuouse pacifyer should in
lamentyng* o^ ^^uysion, put forth a ^^ke and say, that some lay men say y^ some
of the clergy be naught, and love their ease and their wealth / and that some
say that those that seem best and take most labor and pain, be but
ypocrytes for all that, and serve god but for vain glory to get them self
laud and praise among the people.

The.xix. chapyter.
ANd some lay men say farther, that though relygyouse men have ^^tyde wy^h
relygyouse / and that some pref^es have (...) wi^h relygyous in some points
(...) the premynence of their perfeccyon / as (...)

As for calling the worldly honor of y^ church and of spyrytuall men, the
honor of god: I wot nere whether I perceive well* what this man means
thereby. But by the first of those two things, that is to wit by the worldly
honor done to the church, and taken as honor done to god, he someth to mean
the honor that christian people here in the world use to do to the church, as
in byeldyng of y^ chyrches fair and goodly, and in apparellynge the chyrches
for the use of gods service honorably.

And then in the second point, that is to wit the honor of spyrytuall
persons / he means I suppose such honor as good cryste^ people do and are
bou^de^ to do to their prelates and their curates, and to prestes and relygyous
persons, for the respect and regard that they bear both of devotion and very
bounden diewty, to the holy sacrament of their sacred orders, and holy
professyon of their godly state of living.

Then as for the third point that is the things that he says perteyne to the
encreace of riches in spyrytuall men / him self declares sone after, that he
meneth trentals, chau^^eryes, obytes, pardones, and pylgrymages.

Now says he that some lay men lay this for a farther thing, that all the
clergy do use to agree to gether in all these things, how so ever they happen
to varye among them self for some other things. And verily therein I think he
says true / for so must they do or dysplease god / and so does every good
lay man agree with them therein to. And I have seen yt proved by experyence, y^
in some of these things when the lay men have moved some things some time,
whereby should be ^estrayned some such things as y^ clergy might win by / ye
and also no little somewhat taken from them, to that that lawfully was their own
before: the clergy have not st^^uen with the temporaltye therefore / but rather
then to stykke in conten^yon, have suffered and let yt pa^^e, all be yt the
cantelles that have been cut of, have been somewhat brother then a brydecake, and
greter then a chrystmas lofe in a righ^ good husbands house.

And yet where this pacyfyer says, that some lay men say that in all such
things all the clergy both seculare and (...) agree and hold to (...) self
can if he (...) same some lay men (...) so told him so, that some other lay men
say nay. For they say that they se very well, that in all those things there
are now some such of the clergy, such as yt is pytye that ever they were
thereof, either seculare prestes or relygyouse persons. And yet are there some
such of both, which now cast o^ their favor from borh ^wayne, and from the
christian faith also / and therefore agree not to ^hese th^nges, as those (...)
this man that the whole cl^rgy does / but do bo^^e speak and write against al
these things every whyt, both honor to prelates, byldynge of chyrches,
byenge of bellys and ornaments, and against pylgrymages, (...), chaunteryes,
obitis, and perdons, and finally purgatory to.

The.xx. chapyter.
ANd therefore they say, that all spyrytuall men, as to the multitude, be more
dylygent to enduce the people to such things, as shall bring riches to the
church, as to give money to trentals, and to found chaunteryes and obytes /
and to obtain pardons, and to go upon pylgrymages, and such other: then they
be to enduce them to the payment of their dettes, to make restytucyons for
such wrongs as they have done, or to do the works of mercy to their
neyghbo^^s that be pore and nedy / and that sometime be also in right extreme
necessyte.

Now in good faith for ought that I se, such as so murmur against
chau^teries, trentals, obytes, pardons, and pylgrymages, as would have them all
for done / have an inward hatered unto the profyt of men's souls, beside the
en^^e that they bear to prestes. For some of these things be such that they
make not the prestes so very rich, that all the clergy should for the great
lucre so sore bend unto the setting forth thereof.

For as for chaunteryes, though there be many, no one man can have any great
living thereby / and that a priest should have some living of such a mean
thing as commonly the chau^tryes be, there will I wene no good man find great
fault that all the clergy would have it so / for so would I suppose every good
lay man to.

And as for pylgrymages, though the shrynes be well garnysshed, and the
chapel well hanged with wex: few men I fere me need myche at this day to
grudge and compain of very chargeable offrynges / but those men make most
a do that o^^re no thing at all.

And perdons have been purchased not only by the spyrytualty, but in diverse
places by the good fay^hfull devotion of virtuous temporal princes / ass was
to westmynster and unto the Sauoy, great perdon purchased by the most noble
prince of famous memory king Henry the seventh, father to pu^ most dear
sovereign lord the king that now is. And in good faith I never yet perceived
the people make so great offerynges at a (...), that we should either pytye
greatly their cost, or envy the prestys that profit.

But than the trentallys lo, they be the things ye wot well whereby the
multitude of the clergy and specially the ^lates, ge^e every man among them
an infinyte treasure in a year / so y^ it is no marvel though the whole
clergy seculare and relygyouse, what variaunce so ever they have among them
self bysyde, concerning the preemynence of their perfeccyon as this pacyfyer
says, agree together for all that ^n this poy^t, to keep and hold fast the
tren^a^^ys, because of the grea^e encreace of the richesse that they bring in
by hepes unto every man among them. I that nothing can get by them, beseech
god to keep in mennys deuocyons toward trentallys and toward obytes to. For
as myche as he says that seculare and relygyouse both, stycke to these
profits / yet if religiouse Lutheranys may proceed and prospere, that cast
of their abytes and walk out and wedde nonnys and preche against purgatory,
and make mockes of the mass: many men shall care little for obitis within a
while and set no more by a trentall then a ruffyane at Rome sets by a trent
v^e.

How be it where this pacyfyer says, that some say that all spyrytuall men as
to the multitude, do rather induce the people to p^lgrymages, perdons,
chaunteryes, obytys, and trentallys, then to the payment of their dettes, or to
restytucyon of their wrongs, or to the dedys of almoyse and mercy to their
neighbors that are poor and nedy, and sometime to in right extreme necessite:
for my part I thank god I never herd yet of any one that ever would give that
counsel / nor no more has I se well this pacyfyer him self, for he says it
but under his common figure of some say. But therefore this would I say, that
either he byleued those some that so said unto him / or else he byleued them
not. If he byleued them not / it had been well done to have left their tale
untold, till he had byleued them better. And on the the other side if he
byleued them well / he might as well with conscience have be less light of
bylyefe, or boldly might have byleued that they lied / rather then lyghtely
believe y^ lewd words of some, and upon the malycyouse mowthes o^ some, blow
abroad in books so false a tale him self against not a small sum, but as him
self says as to the multitude against all spyrytuall men.

The.xxi. chapyter.
ANd for as myche as yt is most comenly seen, that among a great multitude
there be many, y^ work rather upon will then upon reason / and that though they
have good zele, yet man^ times they lack good order and dyscrecyon, which is
the mother of all virtue: therefore some persons thinkyng that wordely honor
and* riches lets greatly devotion / so myche that as they think, they can
not stand to gether, have holden opinyon, that yt is not lawful to the church
to have any possessions. And some taking a more mean way therein, have said,
that (as they think) yt y^ lawful and also expedient, that the church have
possessions: but they think, that the great ha^^^dau^ce, that is in the chirch,
does great hurt, and induces in many of t^em / a (...) to worldely things,
and ^etteth and in manner s^raungleth the love of god. And therefore they think,
that it we^^ good to take away that is to mich / and to leave that is
suffycyent. And some (...) as of a polycye to pu^l riches fro the ch^rche, have
inueyed against all such things as bring riches to the church. And because
great riches have comme to the church for ^rayenge for ^oules in pu^gatorye,
have by words affyrmed that there is no purgatory: and that granting of
pardon^ ryseth of couetyse of the church, and profyteth not the people / and
that pylgrimages be of no effect / and that the church may make no laws, and
such other things / as foundynge of chaunte^yes, making of brotherhedes, and
many mo. wherein they show outwardely to rise against all the things before
rehearsed, and to despise them / and yet they know and believe in their hearts,
that all these things be of them self right good and profitable, as they be in
deed if they were ordered as they should be. And some persons there be, that
thorough grace find defaute only at the abusyon and my^^e order of such
things / and speak no thing against the things self / neither of
purgatory, pylgrymages, setting up of images, or such other. For they know
well, they be ordained of god, and that the mysorder ryseth only of man for
couetyse, syngularyte, or some other such like defaute, thorough persuasyon and
desceyte of the gostely enymye.

Here is good reders a special fruitful pyece of three manner of Some says or
three manner of thynkynges. The first is of those that think and say, that it
is not lyefull that the church should have any possessions / but that all
their lyuelod and all such things as any richesse comes into the church by,
should be taken away every why^.

And these men in the judgment of this pytuouse pacyfyer be not dyscrete / but
yet they have be says a good zele though. And this good zele had ye wot
well Simon Fysshe when he made the supplycacyon of beggars. Bu^ god gave him
such grace afterward, that he was sorry for that good zele, and repented him
self and came into the church again, and forsook and forsware all the whole
hill of those heresies, out of which the fou^tayne of that same good zele
sprange.

And of troth some such are th^re yet, that have the same good zele still
that Simon Fys^e had wha^ he* was at the wurste. And god sends some of them
such good speed as they have good zele. For some such have I know^ that have
engroced i^ to their hands myche other mennys goods, and for a while flowred,
and were accounted thryfty, a^^ held their own and other men's to / but in
conclusyon wasted away both ^wayne, and feign to find a place to hy^e their
heddes, or to keep them from prison find some other shyfte.

Of these sort was there one not very long a go, which went about to make
a good bargayne, and was no^ than known but for his own man / and yet is now
god be thanked his own man again, for any other man that he has to wait upon
him. But so happed it than that as he sa^ in a tavern in Lumberdes street with
an honest merchaunt with whom he should have bargayned / the the other had herd
an inclynge which yet he believed not* y^ this man was not much afo^re hand.
And as they ^ell in tal^^yng of the world, they talked at last of the clergy:
wherein when he was fallen, he waxed so warm with the wine, and so full of good
zele, that he swear by y^ mass he trusted shortly to se them lose all / and
that the king should put them all for ever out of his proteccyon. And with
that word he clapped his fyste upon the board, with such a fervent zele that
his own proteccion fell out of his sleue. which when the the other perceived /
brother (quod he) you be not a these I think, and therefore I trust it is no
perdo^ that ye have purchaced there. you trust you say to se the clergy put
out of the kings proteccio^ / and I purpose to se you out of the kings
proteccio^, e^e you and I bargayne any more together.

And such bank ruptes be these men of that good zele, that gape after the
spoil of the spyrytualty / which when they have wasted and mysse spent their
own, would than very feign save for hangyng rob spyrytuall and temporal to.

The.xxii. chapyter.
THe secund sort that this pacyfyer speaks of, be they that think and say
that it were good to take away fro the clergy all that is to myche, and leave
that is suffycyent / because that great habundau^ce lets they say, and in
manner straungleth y^ love of god. And these that thus say / this pacyfyer
allows for folk wise and dyscrete. But by what right men may take away
from any man spyrytuall or temporal against his will, the land that is all
ready lawfully his own / that thing this pacyfyer tells us not yet. But he
will peradventure at an other time tell us of some men that lay this reason
and that reason for it. But I have herd some good and wise and well learned men
say, that all the world can never bring the reason that ever can preue it
right. And as for mine own part, like as I have somewhat more largely said
in my book of the supplycacyon of the souls / if any man would give the
counsel to take any mannys land or good from him, pretendynge that he has
to myche, or that he uses it not well, or that it might be better used if some
other had it: he gives such a counsel as he may when he list, and will
peradventure after, streche a great deal ferther then the goodys or possessions
of only spyrytuall men.

And where he says that some say that great habundaunce does let, and in
manner strangle the love of god: y^ is many times very true, that many men in
plenty forg^te god, which in penury run unto him. But this reason runs
out against every kind of me^ spyrytuall and temporal to / and yet are there
in both twain some, in whom the love of god is neither let nor strangled
therwyth / but it is made by the good use thereof the matter and occasyon of
merit. which if it might not be, but must needs let and strangle the love
of god / then were y^ reason so strong against all men, that no man might with
out dedely sin keep any habundaunce in his hands. And than if to wythdrawe
that ineuytable necessyte of dampnable dedely sin, it were lawful to take as
much away from any one man, as the remanaunt that were left hy^^ should be but
even suffycyent: the same reason would as I say serve with one little wre^che
ferther, to take in like wise away from every other man were he spyrytuall or
temporal, in whom there might be laid appearance of so much habundaunce, that
it let him to love god. For that is ye wot well every ma^bounde to do
spyrytuall and temporal both.

And on the the other side if there be taken from no man any thing, but from him
that has so much, as no man that has so much, may so love god as he may come
to heaven / then shall there be from no man taken any thing. For I doubt not
but that there are at this day holy saints in heuyn, of such as were
spyrytuall and of such as were temporal to, that had while they lived here,
as great possessions as has either spyrytuall or temporal within the realm
of England now.

Moreover sith this pacyfyer accompteth them for dyscrete, that leuynge the
clergy suffycyent, would that all the remanaunt were taken away from them,
because the great habundau^ce lets them they say to love god: yt had been
well done that he had somewhat declared his mind how little he calls
sufficye^t / lest y^ some of his discret folk would vndyscretely mysse construe
that word, and for lack of such favor and pytye as him self ye se well
^ereth to y^ cle^gye, would leave them to little and call yt enough. For if this
pacifyer would mother and measure his suffycyencye by the words of saint
Poule, where he says: Having mete and drink and where with to be covered,
let us be content: except him self that loves them go farther therein and
appoynte them their fare and their apparel to, some other happily that love
them not so well, will deuyse them a diete as thynne as Galiene deuyseth for
him that has an obstruccyon in his liver / and because saint Poule speaks but
of keueryng, will dyuyse them clothes that shall only keuer them and not keep
them warm.

Bysyde this, yt seems that yet his dyscrete folk should not under the name
of habundau^ce, take all from y^ church that they would take from every man to
whom they would leave bare suffycyent / but that they rather should such as they
would take from one that has more then suffycyent* dyuyde it among such other
of the church that have less then suffycyent. Now if they should yet besides
this (which I wene they should not) find yet a great some remaining after
all the spyrytuall folk sufficye^tly provided for / then had it ben good
that he had yet farther dyuysed, how yt would please him y^ his discre^es
should order y^ remanau^t. For though they be as he takes them dyscrete
persons of them self, because they would take away but the great habu^daunce,
and leave but the bare suffycyent: yet their dyscrecy on shall do a great deal
the better, if yt like him to give them his dyscrete counsel to.

when it should come to this point / here might padue^ture him self and his
discretes make us many deuycys, and ever the more the more indiscreet.

I have been within these four or five years (For before I herd little
talking of such manner of dyuycys) but within this four or.v. years, I have been at such dyuyces in diverse good merry co^panyes, never ernestely talkyng
thereof (For as yet I thank god that of this matter I never herd any such) but
for pass time by way of famylyare talking, have I herd diverse, both in
hand with prelates and seculare prestys and relygyouse persons, and talked of
their living, and of their lernyng, and of their lyuelod to / and whither them
self were such as it were better to have them or lack the^ / and then
touching their lyuelod whyther it might be lawfully taken from them or not /
and if if might, whyther it were expedyent so to be / and if it so were, then
to what use. And in many such merry talkynges I have always remembered / and
because out communicacy on came sometime to a myche like point, sometime have I
told and rehearsed the story that Titus Liuius tells of one Pacuuius Calanius
y^ Capuaue, in the third book of his third decade that treats of y^ Romans
war with Hanibal and the city of Carthage. This Capua was of all ^taly the
chyefe city, and of the gretest power save only the city of Rome. In which
city so happed it, that the comynaltye were fallen in grudge and murmur, and
at dyuysyon with the senate / as this pacyfyer says that the temporaltye is
here at these days against the clergy.

whereupon this Calanius being a senator, and ^atheles lenynge all unto the
people (because he saw them by sufferaunce and ouersyghte of the senate, grown
into an unbridled lyberty / and as they must be what they conspyre whole
together, waxen the more mighty part) studied and bythought him self what
mean he might inuente first to bring the senate in his danger / and than by
some benefyte win all their good wyllys / and yet therwyth all encreace his
favor with the people bysyde. Upon this being as it happed the chyef
governor of the city for the time / he brake upon a day suddenly to the
senate, and told them that them self wist well enough what grudge the people
had to them / but the parel and dau^geour that they then presently stood in,
that he said wyste they not. But he knew well that the people intended now
after y^ great overthrow which the Romans had late had at Cannas, to kill
up all the senators, and break their lege with the Romans and fall into the
part of Hanniball. How be it quod he if ye dare put your self in my hand /
I have devised a way whereby ye shall se me shortly, not only save all your
lyuys but also preserve your state. And when the senators in that sudden fere
agreed to put him whole in trust to order all y^ matter as he would: he
commanded them all suddenly to be locked fast in their counsel chamber /
and setting armed men at the gate to se that neither any other man should
enter in unto them, nor any of the^ come out: he called suddenly to an assemble
the whole people of the city / and there said in this wise unto them. The
thing that ye have dear fre^des these many days myche desired, that ye might
ons be revenged upon this unhappy senate, and amoue them from the ^ome that
by their couetouse and cruel delyng have well showed them self full vnmetely
to bear the name of fathers unto the people: this thing have I now by polycy
for pour sakes peasybly brought unto your hands / and that in such wise as ye
shall not need to fight therefore, or assawte pertycularely their howses. In
expugn^cyon whereof, being* as they would be fensed with their servants and
their friends, your self might stand in parell* But I have shette them up
yender together alone by the^ self, clean out of armor without aid or any
manner defense, where you shall have them all without any mannys death or stroke.

At this word glad was all the people / and geuynge him high thanks, would
forth with feign have been upon them. Syrs there needs in this point none have
quod he / but one thing is there tha^ if ye thought thereon, ye would I dare say
do first. For they be the why^e ^aufe enough, there as they escape not from
you. But I have ever know^ you so wise, that ye will not I wot well set your
short present pleasure before your perpetual welthe, which ye s^ well ye
should do if ye should live lawless and without a rule / nor no law can
s^rue except there be some governors. And therefore two things must ye do at
ones / that is to wit, both remove these, and also set of your selves some
better men in their places.

wherefore I have brought here their names in a pot. Let them be drawn out /
and as they come unto hand, determyne your pleasure of their persons, and
substytute therwyth their successors. This mocio^ of Calauius was such, y^
either of reason they could not myslyke yt, or else for shame they would not
refuse yt. And theruppon out was there drawn a name, at the herynge whereof
the cried out all the company, and evil and a noughtye man, and bode a way
with him. Uery well quod Calauius / whom will you now name to put in his
place. At that they pawsed a little and began to bythynke them. But shortly
some named one and some named a another.

But with perusyng after this fashyon of a few, there was none that one man
named and a^aunced for good* but five for that one rejected him / as either
very naught* or at the least more unmeet to take in, then he whom they would
put out. So that long ere they had perused half / as much as they
mysselyked many of they^ old, yet found they yt so (...) a thing to find out
the better new* that they wax^^ (...) of the seeking. So that Calauius
perceuyng them (...) in the mate^ somewhat to staker and stay / persuaded them
easily to concord with t^ose that they had before / and theruppon they left
of their e^^ccyon, and let the new chos^n pass, and kept their old senate
still.

And surely somewhat* like but not all after this fashyon, has yt fared in such
good company as yt has happed me to be at communycacyon upon these matters of
the clergy.

For in conclusion after many fautes laid against the spyrytualty that is now,
and many new dyuyses for their lands / when we came at last unto Calauius
pageaunt, and those that found the fautes in the body at large, in such a
large fashyon laid forth by them, as though there were not one good man among
them: when they had the names of th^s prelate and that prelate recy^ed and
rehearsed unto them by row, and were asked what say you by him, and what by
him / all be yt y^ they did by some of them say they were naught, and that if
like as the Capuanys should have changed a senator for a comuner, so if they
should for every one of the spyrytualtye take into his plac^ by choice and
eleccyon* some good temporal man, they might for this prelate or that
concerning some of them, shortly make a good change. For some of them
thought they such, as for one point or other they could not lightly find a
worse. yet on y^ the other side again, at some of them they stayed and stakered,
and with myche work brought forth some at last, with whom they might as they
^houghte match them / and yet by their own confession no more then match
them, and in my mind not so much neither / but like as in some they and I
somewhat varyd, so in diverse other we were agreed both, that for to make the
change, neither could they find their better nor their match neither.

Now where as we went thus no farther they the prelates / if we should have
perused over y^ whole clergy both relygyouse and seculares / though we might
have found out some that both moughte and gladly would have been changed for
the prelates (for I have herd many lay men that would be bishops with a good
will) and though we moughte have also founden enough of those that would match
them that are evil and naughty s^culare prestes, and them that are run out
of relygyon to, and that would and were able to match them in their own
ways were they never so bad: yet of those that would march y^ good as few as
some folk would have the seem, yt would not I wene as the world goth now, be
very easy to find out so many.

But as welthy, and as easy, and as gloryouse as some say to this pacyfyer that
religyon is / yet if some other should say to them, lo syrs these folk that are
in religyon shall out, come you into relygyon in their stedes, and live there
better then they do, and you shall have heuyn / they would answer I fere me,
that they be not yet weary of this world.

Then if they were invited into relygyon on the the other fashyon, and were said
unto them thus: Syrs we will not bid you live so strayte in relygyon as these
men should have done / come on and enter, and do but even as they did, and they
shall you there have a good easy life and a welthy, and myche worldely praise
therewyth: I wene a man should not yet for all that get them to go to yt. But
as easy as we call it, and as welthy to / and now peradventure when our wives
are angry, wyshe our self therein: yet if yt were thus offered, we would play as
Isope tells a fable of a pore old man / which beryng up a^ hill a bourden
of business in his neck, for help of his necessite pa^tyng for werynesse, in
the mydde way laid down his burden and satte him down and syghed, and wa^ed
so weary of his life y^ he wyshed and called for death. wheruppon death came anon
redyly toward him, and asked him, what wylt thou with me. But when the pore
fellow saw him y^ lene horeson there so ready: I called you sir quod he to pray
you do so much for me, as help me up again wy^h this bychede burdayne, and
lay yt in my neck. So wene I that for all our words* if that easy life and
welthy that (...) in relygyon, were offered us / as weary as we be of wedding,
we would rather abide all our old pain abroad, the^ in a cloister take a
relygyouse mannys life for ease. So that in conclusyon we should be feign
either to put worse in their stead, or keep our old still, till as they
little and little dye and depart, god in like wise little and little as he has
ever hitherto provided, shall inspyre his grace into the breasts of other, and
make them fall in devotion and enter into relygyon, and so ^uccede in their
places.

Now as yt fared in our co^munycacyon by the spyritual persons / so fared yt in
a manner by the spyrytuall mennys possessions. Not for that we might not always
find other enough content to enter into their possessions, thought we could
not always find other men enough content to enter in their relygyons, but for
y^ in ^yuysynge what way they should be better bestowed, such ways as at the
first face seemed very good, and for the comfort and help of pore folk very
chary^able, appeared after upon reasonynge, more likely within a^while to make
many beggars mo, then to releue them y^ are all ready. And some way y^ appeared
at y^ first to mow stand the realm in great stead, and be an increase of the
kings honor, with a great strength for the land and a great suerty for the
prince, and a great sparynge of the peoples charge / well appeared after upon
farther reasonynge, to be the clean contrary, and of all other ways the worste.

And to say the troth, much marvel have I to se some folk now so myche and
so boldly speak of taking away any possessyo^s of the clergy. For all be it
that onys in the time of the famous prince king Henry y^ fourth, about the
time of a great rumble that the heretykes made, wha^ they would have destroyed
not the clergy only but the king also and his nobylyte to / there was a
folysshe byll and a false put into a parleament or twayn, and spedde as they
were wurthy: yet had I never founden in all my time while I was conuersaunt in
the court, of all the nobylyte of this land above the number of seven (of
which seuyn there are now three deed) that ever I perceived to be of the mind,
that it were either right or reasonable, or could be to the realm profitable
without lawful cause, to take any possessions away from the clergy, which
good and holy princes and other devout virtuous people, of whom there be now
many blessed saints in heaven, have of devotion toward god geuyn to the
clergy, to serve god and pray for all christen soulys. And therefore as for
such folk as this pacyfyer calls dyscrete, for their dyscrete inuencyon of
taking from the clergy the abundaunce of their possessions / I never look to
se them so dyscrete, as were those men both dyscrete and devout that gave
them.

The.xxiii. chapyter.
YEt puts this pacyfyer a third kind of thynkers such a kind as I never
to my remembrance have herd of before, that is to wit of such as purposely
say evil and openly speak heresye, and for all that think well. And those he
says are polytyke, which to pull away riches fro the church, speak against
all thing that any thing bring into it / as against prayenge for souls in
purgatory, grauntyng of pardons, pylgrymages, making of laws, fou^ding of
chau^teries making of brothereheddes and many mo.

And though they speak agayn^^e all these things / yet he says they know
well enough that all these things be good and may be well used. But because
they bring riches into the church / therefore he says though they know them
for good and think them ^ood, yet they speak against (...) ^ll of polycy / not
against (...) ^^^ses only, but also against the very things self. For of
those y^ speak against thabuses only, he puts another sort bysyde these
men whom he calls for this point so polytyke. And he says that those that
only speak against thabusys, do better and have more grace / but yet that
excludes not ye wot well, but that the the other may be good enough, and have
grace enough to, though not so much.

Thus has this pacyfyer put three kinds of folk that would have the goodys
taken from the church.

The first, of those that would take all and leave nothing. And those men he
says have a good zele.

The secunde, of those that would leave suffycyent and take a way the
remanaunt. And those men have he says good dyscrecyon.

The third kind he calls those, which rather then the church should have
any thing, let not to speak against good things. And those men though they
speak openly platte and plain heresye / yet he denies not to be wise me^ and
use a good polycy.

But now where as they deny purgatory / this is as me thinks an ^uyll
polycy, for wythdrawynge of offrynges fro y^ clergy, to withdraw therwyth our
almoyse from the pore lay people to / and yet that wurste is of all from the
sely souls them self, that lie there and pytuousely cry in pain.

By this polycy ye wot well y^ these polityke folk might impu^gne in general
y^ affeccion of geuynge any thing in almoyse. For that affection ye wot well
brings in y^ year somewhat into some part of the clergy. And well ye wot
that sith the bylyefe of purgatory and other of those things against which
these polytyke men so speak, be plain and open true this reveled by god / and
the contrary bylyefe is by the hole catholyke church plainly determined for
heresy / and sith men can not know that a man byleueth the truth in his heart,
if he hold against it openly with his mouth / and those therefore that speak
heresies, every good man that hereth them is bounden to denou^ce or accuse the^
/ and the bysshoppes are bounden upon their words proved to put them to
penance and reform them / which if they refuse or fall in relapse, the
bishop is bound to deliver them, and all good temporal governors are than
bounden to punyshe them: if every other man did on all sides the part of a
good christian man, it appears that the polycy of those whom this pacyfyer
calls so politic, would within a while prove a pore polycy.

How be it what mind this pacyfyer has him self concerning these points /
him self declares that he byleueth y^ right way and the true. which I am
very glad to here / and for my part as help me god I verily trust he
fayneth not therein, but as a true christen man verily says as he thinks. And
yet is not every man therein of my mind. And therefore it would be wrong if
every some say and every some think, should serve to bring a man in hatered or
obloquy. For surely some say that they think, that if some men may as he says
of polycy feign them self heretykes, and yet bylyue full truly for all that
in their hertes / some one man may myche better feign him self for polycy full
catholyke, and yet in his heart believe the while full falsely. But what so ever
some men say or some men think, in that matter I never will think that a man
byleueth other wise than he says he does, but if him self should by some other
words or deeds of his own, declare of his mind the contrary. And as I will
not against a mannys words spoken according to the right says, think that
he byleueth wrong: surely so can I not think that he which in his words
openly inueyeth against good and faithful things, and dyspyseth true points
of the common known catholyke faith, does in his heart secretly think and
believe right / but if he were among Paynems that would for fere of pain
compel him to renye his faith, which were yet in that case dampnable to his
soul, and therefore is here among christen men where no such force compels
him, but upon his petell forbedeth him, of very good reason dampnable to his
body.

The.xxiiii. chapyter.
How be yt what this good pacyfyer though he believe right him self and
plainly protests the treuth of his bylyete, yet what he would should be done
either with those that against their own wrong words he byleueth to believe
tyght in their minds, or with those either whom he byleueth to believe wrong
in deed, I can not very well gather of his words here. For here he says of
them thus: And though some men have mystaken them self in the said arty^fes /
yet diverse other have said that if they had been well and ^harytably handeled,
they might have been reformed, and peradventure saved in body and in soul.

In these words I find again good readers a plain open declaracyon as in my
mind, that this man byleueth in these artycles like a true catholyke man. For
he confesses in these words, that all those that have dyed in the contrary
bylyefe, been perysshed in body and soul. For he says that some men say,
that with good handelynge they might have been reformed, and peradventure
saved in body and soul. So that it appears by these words, that neither him
self thinks, nor ^hath herd so myche as any other men say, but that they be
now plainly lost and perysshed for those heresies. which is yet an other good
token that he not only byleueth well him self, but also talks not myche nor
has no such conuersacyo^ with heretykes, y^ they dare well and plainly put
him in full trust. For if he were / he should here them undoubtedly say, that
those folk be saved soulys and holy saints / as Baynam that was late burned
said by Bayfelde both an heretyke and an apostata, that was burned about a
year before him.

How be it though they call them saved sowles and saints / yet will they say
that they be not in heuyn. For there is no soul they say / but in some place
of rest they lie still and sleep full soundely / and sleep shall they say till
Gabryels trumpe a wake them and call them* up erely, to rise and record
their appearance before our savior at the general day of dome.

But in good faith this one thing am I sorye to se, that sith him self seems
to me so faithful, and that therefore I can not persuade unto my self, but that
in his own heart he loves and favors the clergy / which no man can as I
think heartily hate, but he that hates also y^ faith: some of these wyly
heretyques like the angelys of Satan transfygurynge them self into the
lykenes of angelys of light, should so deceive this good man, and so abuse his
good gentell nature and symplycyte, as to make him with their wyly invented
figure of some say, under a pyty pretended toward those herytikes that are in
their obstynacy peryshed, set his words in such wise, as though his mind were
to aggreue and bring in hatered among the people, the name and body of the
clergy / by making the people wene that their ordynaryes had with evil and
vncharytable handelyng, ben the occasyon that those heretyques are both in
soul and body destroyed / sith they might as is here said under y^ figure of
some say, by good and charytable handelyng of the clergy, have been better
reformed, and peradventure in soul and body saved.

would god these same some folk that so have said unto this pacyfyer, had
named him at the lest wise some one, that was so evil and so vncharytably
handeled, that the lack of better and more charytable handelynge, has been the
loss of his body and soul. For then might the clergy declare their demeanure
toward that man / and then should they perceive by this pacyfyer, in which part
of their delynge good charytable manner ^acked. But verily whom so ever they
should have named / I ^oute not but those y^ were the ^rdyna^yes in the cause,
cou^de easily prove that they (...) used no rygour to him (...) the law, nor
omytt^^ no charitable mean unto him that came to their minds, while the man
lived and the matter in their hands, nor in prouydyng for good exhortacyon
toward his conuersy on again and his salvation, even till the life left his
body.

But now for as myche as some so say by the^ concerning some of them that are
gone / the clergy would I wene be yet glad to here, in what wise manner of
charytable fasshyon this pytuouse pacyfyer would have them handle other
heretyques hereafter, such as shall be denounced, and ex officio brought
before them.

For all be it y^ this pacifyer in a another place, somewhat seems to mysse like
that order: yet I fere me there would as I shall after show you, many a place
in the realm swarm very full, ere ever they were brought before the ordynary
by the mean of accusacyon.

How be yt let us put the sample by some one, that is lykely to be brought
and delivered unto the ordynarye, by the mean of the kings grace and his
counsel. I mean John^ Fryth. For he is in prison in y^ tower all ready taken
by the bishops servants, by the aid of the kings officers at
commandment of his grace and his counsel, and so by the kings officers
brought into the tower where he remains yet / and therefore he shall I doubt
not be brought as I said, and delivered unto the ordynary.

Now then if the ordynary knew this good pytuouse pacyfyer, and would because
he sees his good and charitable mind, desire him of his good advise and
counsel, in what wise he might best and most charitably handle him for the
saving of his soul and body, the laws of Christ's church observed, that the
saving of him if he would stycke sty^^e in his obstynacy, should not be y^
occasion of corruptynge and destroynge the souls of other men / what counsel
would this man give him?

First if no man would profess him self for his accusare, and yet there would
twenty be ready when they were by commandment of the court compelled, not to
let but depose y^ truth, that he has sins he came in the tower, written a
fresshe against purgatory, and a book that he calls the Mirror against
rel^gyouse, aduysyng every man to give none of them nothing though they be of
that relygyon that nothing have of their own / and twyse has he there in like
wise written against the catholyque faith of Christ concerning the blessed
sacrament of the altar: whyther would now this pacifyer, that the ordynarye
having good prouys and yet none accuser, should proceed against him ex
officio, or else for lack of an accuser let him fair go. If he would he
should proceed ex officio as I think he would think yt reason: what should he
then do, sith all can not be done in a day. whether should he let him walk
abroad upon his promise to appear again, which Fryth were lykely to break and
get him over see / or else take suertyes bounden for his appearance, as John^
Purser and some such other were bounden for John^ Byrt, and force not to
forfayt their bond for bretherhed, but let him slyppe a side and never bring
him forth, and keep him close among the brethern as the the other was kept, till
y^ postle may make some bysshoppes among the new brethern / and after his new
Titus and Timothe stablyshed each in his own see, then the new Poule this
apostle Fryth, take shippyng at Sandwych and sail into Freselande.

would this pacifyer advise the ordynarye thus / or else to keep him in prison
where he should do no hurt, and let the walls and the lokkes be his
suertyes for his forth coming.

Thus far yet as I suppose this pacyfyer would advise the ordynary to keep
Fryth fast. But now when his heresies were laid unto his charge, as for to
give counsel to the ordynary to exhort Fryth to leave them / this pacyfyer I
dare say shall not need, nor to take him to grace neither, nor to show him
great favor upon good tokens of his repentance and amendment. But now if he
were one of this pacyfyers polytykes, and would say that he believed ever the
right way in his own heart contrary to the words that his own hand wrote /
but after the manner that this pacifyer speaks he wrote all these heresies of
polycye, because that by the bylyefe of purgatory, and of the sacrament of the
altar, and of miracles i^ so many places so plainly showed thereon, he saw
that offering and richesse came into the clergy, and therefore would say that
he must not be taken for an here^yke: but for a man wise and polytyke: what
advise would here this pacyfyer give his ordinary?

what counsel would he give the ordinary if Fryth would make none excuse by
policy, but say that he w^ote against purgatory and all relygyouse orders,
and the sacrament of the altar to, for love y^ he bears to the troth / and
that those heresies be very faith, by which he will abide unto the death. what
advise will this pacyfyer give the bishop than? what good and cherytable
handelynde will he deuyse to save his body and soul / specially when he shall
se certain letters which some of the brethren let fall of late, and lo^t
them of lykelyhed as some good kytte leseth her kayes / by which letters both
Tyndale and George Iay write unto Fryth, and counsel him to stycke fast /
and Tyndale shows him that all the brethern look what shall become of him,
and that upon his speed hangs all their hope. I can not tell what good and
cherytable handelynge this pacyfyer can deuyse / but I dare say that there is
neither ordynary nor other honest man spyrytuall nor te^porall, but that he is
as sorry as this pacyfyer him self, to se that young man or any other, so
stobernly set in such heresies, that no man can show him the favor that every
man ^ayne would, without the dys pleasure of god and perell of their own
sowlys and many other mennys to.

The.xxv. chapyter.
ANd upon all these matters there (...) risen a great opinion in the people, in
manner universally, that in puny shyng and correccions all these persons before
rehearsed should have like punisheme^t, if spyritual men might have free lyberty
in that behalf. And that spyrytuall men would if they could, as well put them
to silence, that speak against the abusyon or dysorder of such thinge^ as be
before rehearsed, as them that spek^ against the thing self.

Those words be not very well spoken of this pacyfyer by the people. For if he
have spoken with many mo then the tone half, and felt their opynyons him
self / else is yt not only against the spyritualty spoken very shamfully,
but also to the false contryued rebuke of the whole people in manner universally.
For sith that neither this pacyfyer nor any man else, can bring forth any one
of these heretyques, that have been by their ordynaryes delivered for their
obstinacy in the seculare hands and burned, that have had any wrong done
them, or ben therein otherwise ha^deled then charity with justice, according to
the comen laws of all Christ's catholyke church, and the laws of this realm
have required: there is no good man nor reasonable that has any cause thereby
to conceive by the clergy such a malycyouse folysh suspycyon, as this pacyfyer
here untruely layth unto the whole people of this realm in manner universally /
when he makes as though y^ hole people in manner universally were so malycyouse
and so folyshe, as because the clergy which has toward many heretykes been
over myche favorable, have of necessyte be dreuen to deliver the^ to the
seculare hands and therein have done them right, he makes as though the whole
people were in manner universally so mad and malycyouse, as theruppon to take
an opynyo^ that to those which are none heretykes the clergy would do wrong.

Surely in this one point is this book of his the most indyfferent that it is
in any part that I se therein. For there is no point in all the book wherein
it more dyffameth the spyrytualtye, then in this one it dyffameth in manner all
the whole people universally.

But now if he say the people in manner universally, think that those which
are as he says for lack of good and cherytable handelynge lost and peryshed
in body and soul, had wrong and ought not have been by the clergy delivered
to the seculare hands / and that therefore the whole people in manner
universally do and well may, think in their minds that the clergy would in
likewise do wrong to other, and bring to like punyssheme^t all those persons
that any thing speak against only the abusyons of such thing as bring
richesse in to the church: now can not this pacifyer thus excuse his words.
For he confesses in his own words, that they which thus have been lost and
perysshed, that might as he says with good and cherytable handelynge have been
saved, be of those that have mysse taken them self in those artycles of
purgatory, trentallys, obitys, and pilgrimages, and have as him self says
before, spoken against them and despised them / and then had they no wrong.
For I am sure there was none of them, but that he was either relapsed, or else
did of obstynacy stand still in them. And then appears it yet again, that in
going about to dyffame the clergy, he does in deed greatly diffame the
people / when he says that because the clergy has punysshed them that have so
far myssetaken them self in those articles, that they have spoken against
those holy things and despised the things self, the people would be so far
unreasonable as therefore to think y^ they would punyshe in likewise all those
y^ would only speak against the abuses and not against the things. For all
the people sees perde, that the clergy punyssheth those that speak against
the sacrament of matrymony / and yet they punysshe not those that speak against
the abuses there of, as aduowtry / or against those that under the name of
matrymony, live in sacrylege and incestuouse lechery / as friar Luther does and
friar La^bert, and friar Huyskyn and Otho the monk, and such other.

And yet if he will go from his own words again, and say now that some of
them that be for lack of good and charytable ha^delyng in body and soul so
peryshed, did not mysse take themself at al, nor did not speak against any of
y^ things, but did only speak against the abuses, and that therefore he may
without reproach of y^ people well say y^ the people have an opinion, that the
^^ergy would if they might, have fre lybertye in like manner to punyshe all
other that would in like manner speak / that is to wit not against the good
and holy things, but against the abuses of them: to this I say yet ones
again, that he still dyffameth the people of a great intolerable fault, that
is to wit an unjust and unreasonable judgment / while he says that they
think and believe that the clergy has done to those men in so great a matter
so great wrong, and hitherto not one such wrong proved.

But I shall in this point go yet a little nerer him. Since he speaks of those
that might with charytable handelynge have been in body and soul saved / yt
appears well as I have said, that in this pyece of his tale he speaks of
those that have not be saved, but in earth here condemned and burned, and in
hell dampened and there burning still. Now as for any time so late before this
brablynge or speech of any dyuysyon between the spyrytualty and the temporalty,
that this pacifyer might seem to mean of / I remember none delivered to the
seculare hands, but sir Thomas Hytton at Maydestone, and sir Thomas Bylney at
Norwyche, and one of late at Excester, and one of late in Lincoln^ diocese, and
in London here Bayfeld the monk, and Teuxbery the powchmaker, and Baynam. Now
this will I say / let th^s pacyfyer come forth / or if he be any religyouse
recluse that can not come abroad, let him appear by attorney (How be yt, yt
appears that he can be none such, but must needs be of lykelyhed some such
as gooth myche abroad, for eli^s he could not surely tell us of so many some
says, nor what opinion the whole people of the realm has in manner
universally) and therefore let him come forth and appear in his own proper
person, before the kings gra^e and his counsel, or in what place he list,
and there prove calling me thereto, that any one of all th^se had wrong,
but if it were for y^ they were burned no sooner / and because he shall not
say* that I bydde him t^otte about for naught / this shall I profer him, that
I will bynd my self for suerty and find him other twain bysyde of better
substance then my self, that for every one of these whom he proves wro^ged,
his ordynary or his other offycer by whom the wrong was done, shall give this
pacyfyer all his costs done about the proof, and a reasonable reward bysyde.

And yet now though no man would give him nothing / it were his part perde to
prove it for his own honestye, sith he has said so far.

And this dare I be bold to offer, to se the troth openly proved. After which
well proved onys to be as he says, men may be bold to say the thing that
they se proved true / and thereupon if they lift, to cast and suspecte some
ferther fere of the like, ye or of wurse if they will, I will not let the^. But
without any such thing proved before / there will no reason nor good conscience
bear it, that we should suspecte that our prelates and ordynaryes in their
judgments against heretykes, use to do them wrong / sith all y^ laws both
spyrytuall of the whole church, and temporal of this realm, have ordained
full faith and credence to be given to them therein. which laws to contrary
now there appears little cause, considering that the king our sovereign lord
that now is and long mote be, has in his time as prudentely and as
vertuousely provided for this realm, that it should have such prelates and
ordynaryes as should in learning, wisdom, justice, and living, be mete and
convenient therefore, as any prince has (number for number) that has reigned
over this realm, I dare boldly say this hundred year / and should in my mind
keep my self a great way within my bounds, all though I would set an other
hundred to it. But now lettynge this pyece pass, wherein I might yet say many
things mo then I do, and would save that the brethren would than call me
long, and will yet peradventure say that I am scant short enough: let us go
ferther and speed up this one chapyter of his.

The.xxvi. chapyter.
ANd many other mur^^urs and grudges beside these that be before rehearsed / be
among the people, mo then I can rehearse now: but yet above all other me
thinks that it is most to be lamented and sorowed / that spyrytuall men,
knowing these gr^dges and murmuracyons among the people, and knowing also
that many lay men have opinion, that a great occasyon thereof ryseth by
spyrytuall men, and that they do no more to appease the^, ne to order them
self in no other manner for the appeasyng of them, then they do. For all that
they do therein mo^^e commenly is this: they take yt, that they that find
defa^te at such abusyons and dysorder / love no prefies: and therefore they
esteem that they do of malice all that they do / to destroy the church, and to
have their goods and possessions them self: and therefore they think it a
good deed to se them punished, so that they shall not be able to bring their
malice to effect. And therefore have they punyshed many persons, wihch much
people have judged them to do upon will / and of no love unto the people. And
though spyrytuall men are bound in this case, for appeasynge of these opynyons
in the people, which be so dangerous as well to syrytuall men, as to
temporal men, that many souls stand in great peril thereby, not only to
reform them self, and to leave and avoid all things, that give occasyon to
the people so to offend / that may be charity be omytted and left, but also
to fas^e, pray, wear the hear, give almoyse, and to do other good deeds for
them self and for the people, cryenge contynually to our lord / that these
dyuysyons may cease, and that peace and concord may come again into the
world: yet yt appears not that they do so, but that they rather continue
still after the old course, pretending by confederacyes and worldely polycyes,
and strayte correc^yons, to rule the people / and that is greatly to be
lamented, and yt will be hard for them to bring yt so about.

But if they would a little meken them self, and wythdrawe such things a^
have brought the people into this murmur and grudge: they should anon bring a
new light of grace into the world, and bring the people to perfect love and
obedyence to their superyours.

And here me thinks I might say farther in one thing / and that is this,
that as long as spyrytuall rulers will either pretend / that their authorite
is so high, and so immedyatly deryued of god, that the people are bound to
obaye them, and to accept all that they do and teach / without arguments,
resystence, or grudgynge against them / or that they will pretend, that no
defaute is in them, but in the people / and will yet continue still in the same
manner, and after the same worldly contenaunce / as they do now / and have done
late time paste: the light of grace that is spoken of before, will not appear /
but that both parties shall walk in this darkness of malice and diuysyon / as
they have done in time paste.

His other murmours and grudges that he says he cannot now rehearse, he
reherseth after many of them in his other chapyters / which I will pass over
vntowched, both for that the more part of them be such as every wise man will
I suppose answer them him self in the redyng, and satysfye his own mind
without any need of mine help therein / and for that some things are there
also therein, that are very well said / and some also that be they good or
badde, I purpose not to medyll much wythall, as are the things that towche any
laws or statutes all redymade, be they of the church or of the realm, defend
them I am content to do, if I think them good. But on the the other side if I
think the^ naught / albe it that in place and time conuenyent I would give
mine aduyce and counsel to the change, yet to put out books in writing
abroad among the people against them, that would I neither do my self, nor in
the so doing comme^de any man that does. For if the law were such as were so
far against the law of god, that it were not possible to stand with ma^nys
salvation / than in that case the secret advise and counsel may bycome
every man / but the open reprofe and redargucyon thereof may not in my mind well
bycome those that are no more spyrytuall than I. And surely if the laws may
be kept and observed without perel of soul though the change might be to y^
better: yet out of time and place convenient to put the defawtes of y^ laws
abroad among the people in writing, and without any surety of the change
give the people occasyon to have the laws in derysyon, under which they live,
namely sith he y^ so shall use to do may sometime myssetake the matter, and think
the thing not good whereof the change would be worse: that way will I not as
thus aduysed neither use my self nor advise no friend of mine to do. And
therefore I will as I say leave some things of his book untouched, whyther he
sya well or evil. And finally for y^ the towchyng of this matter is no part of
my pryncypall intent, but happens as an incydent to fall in my way, wherein
it suffyseth by the co^syderacyon of one piece or twain, to give men an
occasyon to look well to the remanaunt, and let it not over lightly synke deep
down into the breast, till it be well chammed and chowed in the mouth / and not
only se what he says, but also by the wisdom of the reder consider what may
be said against it / and who so has wit and redeth it in that wise, shall I
warraunte you soon perceive that mild indifferent book, to bear more shrewde
store of evil stuff therein, then the brethern that boste it would that such
good folk should se, as of a good mind menyng none harm, wene every thing
were well meant that they se fair set out to the show, and soft and smothely
spoken.

The.xxvii. chapyter.
I will not also stick much upon his high solemn dyuynacyon, wherein he
prophecyeth that as long as the spyrytuall rulers will either prete^de that
their authoryte is so high, and so immedyatly dyryued fro god, that the people
are bound to obey them, and accept all that they teach, without argument,
re^ystence, or grudge / and that they will pretend that no defaute is in
them, but will yet continue ^tyl in the same manner, and the same worldely
c^tenaunce as they do now and have done in late time paste / the light of grace
that is spoken of before, be with you now and ever more amen.

This end of this holy sermon is to little purpose. For first as for wordly
co^tenau^ce is among the clergy within these few years not a little abated.
which thing who so list with an even eye to look upon yt, and indyfferently
consider yt, shall not fail to perceive. And so there is good hope, if that
may help the matter, that then the light of the grace that this gracious
pacyfyer spoke of before, is not now very far behynd. And verily for aught
that I can se, a great part of y^ proud and pompose appareyll that many prestes
in years not long paste, were by the pride and over sight of some few, forced
in a manner against their own wyllys to wear, was before his godly counsel so
by this pretye prented book pryuyly given them in their ear, myche more I
trow then the tone half spent, and in manner well worn out. And I wot well
yt is worn out with many, which entende herafter to bye no more such again.
And for the resydue of the countenance I dare be bold to waraunt, that I can
find of those that most may spend, which were they sure that yt should in
this matter do any good, would be well co^tente to withdraw from all their other
countenance the chyefe part of their mouables, and of their yearly lyuelode
to, and out of hand bestow the tone, and with their own hand yearly bestow
the the other openly among the pore. And I durst again be bold to warraunt that
if they so did / even the self same folk that now grudge and call them
proud for their countenance, would then find as great a grudge and call
them ypocrytes for their almoyse, and say that they spend upon noughtye
beggars the good that was wont to keep good yomen, and that thereby they both
enfeble and also dishonor the realm.

Now as for the the other part of his prophesye, concerning that the light of
grace that he spoke of before, will not appear as long as spyrytuall rules will
prete^de that their authory^e is so high and so immediately deryued of god,
that the people are bounden to obaye them and to accept all that they do and
teache, without arguments resistance or grudgynge against them: in this part
he must first declare whyther he mean in this words, their authoryte, all
their hole authoryte, or their authoryte in some part. If he mean that they
say thus of all their whole authoryte in every thing that they may now at
this time lawfully do or say: I answer that they neither ^te^de nor never
did, all that authoryte to be given them immedyately by god / but have
authorite now to do diverse things by y^ grant of kings and princes, as
have also many te^porall men / and by those grau^tes have such right in those
as te^porall men have by the like grau^tes in theyrs. And therefore in that part
the pacyfyer is answered.

And tha^ if he mean that the light of his grace that he spoke of before, will
not appear as long as the prelates pretend y^ any part of their authoryte is
so high that it is immedyately given them of god / then has this pacyfyer
lost the light of treuth. For the greatest, and highest, and most excellent
authoryte that they have, either god has given them, him self or else they
be very presu^ptuouse and usurp many t^ynges far above all good reason. For
I have never read, or at the least wise I remember not that I have read, y^
ever any king granted them the authoryte, that now not only prelates but
other pore plain prestes also daily do take upon the^, in mynistryng the
sacraments and consecratynge the blessed body of Christ, with diverse other
authorytees beside

But it seems to him peradventure, that in one point at the least wise y^
spyritualty is to proud. For he says they pretend to be obayed, and have
their ordynaunces and their teachynges observed, without resystence grudge or
arguments to the contrary. Surely in such things as the whole clergy of
chrystendome techeth and orders in spyrytuall things, as be diverse of those
laws which this pacyfyer in some places of this book touches, being made
against heretics / and albeit that they be and long have been through the
whole corpse of chrystendome both temporalty and spyrytualty, by long usage
and custom ratyfyed agreed and confyrmed, yet he lays some lack in them
calling them very sore / in those things I say, that sith I no thing dowte
in my mind / but in that congregation to goddys honor gracyousely gathered
together, the good assyste^ce of the spyryte of god is according to Crystes
promise as very^y present and assystente as it was with his blessed apostles,
me^ ought with reverence and with out resystence, grudge, or arguments to
receive them. And if a prouyncyall counsel err / there are in Cristes
church ordynary ways to reform it. But in such things as any spyrytuall
governors after a lawful order and form, deuyse for the spyrytuall weal of
their sowles that are in their charge, and which things are such as good
folk may soon perceive them for good / in these things at the lest wise
should the good not give ear to the bad folk and froward, that against the
best thing that can be devised can never lack a fond froward argument. And
therefore not only thapostles being diverse, assembled together with the
church in their counsel holden at Jerusalem, did in those laws that they
there devised and prouulged among the gentyls that were in diverse countrees
far of converted unto Christ, did with authoryte write unto them, these
things have seemed both to us and to the spyryte of god necessary for you to
keep, lest some stoborne folys would peradventure be bold with froward
arguments and reasonynge to resyste it* but saint Poule also by him self when
he devised unto the Corinthyes certain good laws and orders concerning their
order that he would have them keep in the church in time of gods service,
lest such as would feign with dysputynge against good order, be taken and
reputed for wise, should with some propleme pulled out of a penny pycher,
enueigle and corrupt the company, whom far the febler reason may draw to
the wurse part for affection unto lewd lyberty: he finally bysyde the reasons
that he laid for his law, did put them to silence with his authoryte / and
forbidyng the^ to reason or dyspute there against but obaye it said, against
all such arguments and such choppelogiques against good rulys, if any man
will be contencyouse in this matter, let him well know that we have no such
guyse or custom, nor y^ chyrches of god.

But now will this pacyfyer peradventure, say that he neither speaks nor
means of such things as the spyrytualtye does or says that is good / but
that the light of grace will not appear as long as the prelates pretend that
their authorite is so high and so immediate of god, that the people are ^ounde
to obaye them, and to accept all that they do and t^^he / with our arguments,
resistance, or grudgyng / so that he has cyrcumspectly for the nones qualyfyed
and modered his tale with this word all, that the prelates should not prete^de
to be obayed in things as well badde as good. who herd ever the prelates of
this realm pretend this? that they should be obayed in all things were the
things bad or good? I am very sure that ever hitherto they have professed the
contrary / and not let to say, that if ever any prelate of this realm, ye
or the most part of them, ye or all the whole mayny were so far fallen fro
god, as to preach the contrary of our old known catholyque faith / as for
ensample that there were no purgatory after this world, or that yt were not
lawful to pray to our blessed lady or other holy saints, or to preche that
there is yet never a saint in heaven, but that all souls lie still and sleep,
or to preach against penance as Tyndale does, that is as loathe good tender
pernell to take a little penance of the priest, as the lady was to come any
more to dyspelynge that wept even for tender heart two days after when she
talked of yt, that the pressed had on good frydaye with the dyspelynge rod
beten her hard upon her lyly white hands: who so would I say preche any of
these heresies, or that in y^ blessed sacrament of the auter were not the very
body and very blood of Crist, but as Fryth teaches nothing but wine and
bread, or else as Tyndale testeth starch i^ stead of bread / though there
would hereafter (which shall I trust never happen) all the prelates in this
realm fall thereto and preach the same, yet all the prelates hitherto plainly
do preach and teach that no lay man should then believe them.

And therefore like as if the prelates did prete^de y^ thing that this pacyfyer
speaks of, then were his aforesaid words well and wisely tempered and
crycumspectly spoken / so while they neither preteude that thing now, nor
never here before did, there is little wit in those words. For now does all
his tale amount unto no more, but y^ the light of grace will never appear, as
long as the prelates do the thing that they neither do nor never did. Is not
this therefore good readers by this good pacyfyer brought unto a wise conclusyon?

The.xxviii. chapyter.
NOw where he most lamenteth that the clergy does no more to appease these
grudges of the temporaltye toward them, and after he preaches to them holyly
what things they should do that they do not, that is to wit, forbere such
things as he spoke of before / whereby he specially means as both before and
in diverse places after appears, the evil and vncharytable handelyng of
heretyques, whereof the man has nothing proved / but also that they should do
things which he says men se them not do, that is to say give almoyse, and
were hear, and fast,* and pray, that this dyuysyon may cease: now y^ all the
spyrytual men do not so, that is very true. And yt is as true I trow that
this thousand year was never the time that all so did. And therefore if that
thing cause and keep in this dyuysyon, yt must have been a thing of a
thousand year old. But I think that many of, them do all these things
which this pacyfyer precheth to have done. For I am sure that though some do
not their part therein / yet among y^ spiritualty there is both geui^g of great
almoyse, and wearynge of hear, and fasting, and prayenge for peace. But
whether they take this dyuysyon to be so great and so universal as this
pacyfyer speaks of, that can I not tell, and peradventure they do not. And
whether they do or no / surely I do not. Nor whyther they pray for the
pacyfycacyon of this dyuysyon in all such manner wise as the thing requires,
that I can not tell / but there may be peradventure therein some over sight
upon their part. For if they leave nothing vnprayed for that may perteyne to
y^ pacificacyo^ of this dyuysyon, then must they peradventure put into their
service both matens, mass, and euynsonge, some special collect, and therein
pray god that yt may please him that the people may perceive the sotle
sleyghtes of the devil and some other of his lymes, in many parts of this
book of this pacyfycacyon / which things peradventure the compyler perceived
not him self, but was therein of symplycyte by some sotle shrewe deceived.

The.xxix. chapyter.
BUt this pacyfyer perceiving that what one man does in secretenesse, a another
can not se / is therefore bold to say they do not all those things which he
would have them do / that is wit, fast, and pray, were hear, and give
almoyse. For he says that they do al^ these things yt appears not.

As for prayenge, yt appears perdye they do. And that so myche they daily
pray, as some of us lay men think yt a pain ones in a weke to rise so sone
fro sleep, and some to tarry so long fasting as on the sunday to come and
here out their matens. And yet is not the matens in every paryshe neither, all
thing so erly begone nor fully so long in doing, as yt is in the
chartrehouse ye wot well. And yet at our sloth and glotony that are lay
people, this pacyfyer can wynke and feign him self a sleep. But that the
clergy prays not, that can he shortly spy, as soon as their lyppes leave
styrynge.

How be yt because he is peradventure of the clergy him self / therefore
lest he should seem parcyall to his own part, he rather speaks of their
defautes then ours: wherein I will not myche strive with him. But surely as he
may be bold to preach being a pressed / so if I were a priest to, I would be
bold to preche thus much again to him, that for any winning of the gloss
and fame of indiffere^cy, though he leave y^ fautes of us lay people vntoucheth,
yet of his own part the clergy, for no lay mennys pleasure he never should
say more then treuth.

For now as towchynge of almoyse / is there none geuyn troweth he by the
spyrytualtye? If he say as he says here, that it appears not y^ they do
give almoyse / I might answer again that they follow therein the counsel of
Christ, which says let not thy left hand se what thy right hand does /
as I might in prayeng have laid those other words of Christ, Thou when thou
wylt pray enter into thy chamber and shette the door, and pray to thy father
privily. But like wise as god for all that counsel was content that men
should both pray and give to the nedy, and do other wurkes both of penance
and of cheryte, openly abroad in company where there be no desire of vayn
glory, but y^ the people by the syghte thereof, may have occasyon to give
therefore laud and glory to god: so dare I boldly lay that as they both
secretly and openly to, do use and accustom to pray so do they both secretly
and openly to, give no little almoyse i^ the year what so ever this pacyfye
say. And I somewhat marvel that sith this pacyfyer goth so bysyly abroad, y^
there is no Some say any where all most in all the whole realm, but that he
hereth it and can rehearse it / I marvel I say not a little that he neither
sees nor hereth any some say, that there is in the spyrytualty given any
thing in almoyse. I use not myche my self to go very far abroad, and yet I
here some say that there is / and I se sometime my self so many poor folk at
westmynster at the dolys, of whom as far as ever I hard, the munkes use not
to send away many unserved, that my self for the preace of them have been fayn
to ride another way.

But one answered me to this onys, and said that it was no thank to them /
for it was lands that good princes have given them. But as I than told him
again / it were than myche less thank to them, that would now give good
princes evil counsel for to take it fro them.

And also if we call it no gyuynge of almoyse by them, because y^ lands
whereof they give it, other good men have given them / whereof will you have them
give almoyse, for they have none other.

The.xxx. chapyter.
ANother thing also which this pacyfyer seems to disprayse under the name of
proud worldely cou^tenau^ce / if men were as ready in a deed of his own nature
indifferent, to construe y^ mind and intent of the doer to the better part, as
they be of their own in ward goodness to construe and report it to the worse /
than might I say that the same thing which they call the proud worldely
countenance, they might and would call a full cherytable almoyse / that is to
wit the right honest finding and good bringing up of so many temporal men
in their service / which though they be no beggars, yet might peradventure
the great part of them go beg if they found them not, but sent them abroad
to seek them self a service.

And like as if you would give a poor man some money because he needs, and yet
would make him work therefore in your gardayne, lest he should by your almoyse
live idell and wax a loyterer, the labor that he does takes not away the
nature and merit of your almoyse: no mo^e it makes the finding of servants
none almoise, though they wait on the fynder and do him service in his house.
And of all almoyse the chyefe is, to se them well brought up, and well and
honestely guyded. In which point though neither part do full their duty /
yet I suppose in good faith, that the spyrytualty goth in that point which is
no small almoyse, rather somewhat before us then anythynge dragge behind us.

The.xxxi. chapyter.
THen follows there fasting / which things the spyrytualty does as I
suppose, all such as keep still the old christen faith, and fall not unto
these new heresies.

But this pacyfyer fyndet^ a fault, and reherseth out of John^ Gerson, that
the clergy keeps not now the (...) we by which it was ordey^^d that the
clergy should (...) a longer lent the^ they now do. And would god as saint
Poule says, that both they and we could and would every day. But this
pacyfyer that is so well seen in the laws of the church, sees well enough
that the universal custom to y^ contrary, discharges the ^onde of that law,
though peradventure yt dyscharged not them that first began the breche whereby
the custom grew. For as for fasting / the (...) of the cu^trey may either to
the bond or to the dyscharge and interpretacyo^ of the (...) made therefore,
the custom I say may do myche, as saint Austayne shows in ^o places the^
one. For if it were otherwise / then fasted almost no man any ^ast at all at
this day while we dyne at none. For the very ^aste was of old, as both by the
scripture and holy writers appears, to forbere their meal till night / which
is as ye se all changed. And the church to condescende unto our infyrmyte,
has be feign therefore to say in lent their even song before none / and
bysyde the natural days, to deuyse us new days ex fictione iuris, that we
should at the lest have euynsonge in the lenton fast before we fall to meat.
And yet we keep not that neither. But as an Almayne of mine acquayntaunce, when
I blamed him lately for not fasting upon a certain day, answered me, Fare to
sold telaye men fasten, let te prester faste^: so we begin god wot to fast
full little for our own part / but bid the prester go fasten. And where our
self would for our own part be fayn that the lent were two wekes less: yet
would we that for the clergy the ^ent were one weke longer. But some of them
toss yt ^ro them self as fast, and send yt to the freres. And verily
relygyouse folk use I trow both long lentes and aduent to, and some of them
diverse other fastes beside / and they be perdye a great part of the
spyrytualtye.

The.xx^ii. chapyter.
^Hen preaches this pacyfyer yet farther, ^ha^ the ciergye should were hear.
He is surely somewhat sore, if he bind them all thereto / but among them I
think that many do all ready / and some whole relygyon does. But yet says this
pacifyer, that yt does not appear y^ they do so* Ah well said. But now if all the lack stand in that point, that such holiness is hid, so that men may not
se yt / yt shall be from hens forth well done for them, and so they will do if
they be wise, upon this aduertysement and preaching of this good pacyfyer, come
out of their cloisters every man into the market place, and there knele down
in the kanell and make their prayours in the open streets, and were their
shyrtes of hear in sight upon their coulys / and then shall yt appear, and
men shall se yt. And surely for their shyrtes of hear in this way were there
none ypocrysye / and yet were there also good polycye, for then should yt not
pryck them.

The.xxxiii. chapyter.
BUt as for all this pacyfyers preaching, the spyrytualty may be content to
take in good worth. For peradue^tur if he were known, he were such one as to
preche to all the spyrtualtye might well become his personage / and yet if he
be but a simple person in deed, yet the spyrytualty may meken them self
according to his good counsel, and admyt his wholesome admonycyons. But surely
this one thing, though the spyrytualtye bear yt and take yt well in worth / me
thinks yet that every good temporal man may very much misselyke, that this
pacyfyer in the beginning of this his holy preaching, preaches upon them to
their sore slander / first with an untrue surmyse grounded upon ymagynacyon,
and after with a very plain open lie / neither an idle lie nor of any good
purpose (of which two kinds of lyeng saint Austayn admytteth neither another,
in folk of y^ perfeccyon that th^s pacyfyer by his preaching used with such
authoryte toward all the spyrytualtye, should seem to be) but a lie very
pernycyouse, ^hyche is one of the things y^ lest can become any good christian
man.

For first hy says, that all that the ^pyrit^a^ty does to the appeasyng o^
the people is mo^^e c^menly this, that they take yt that they that find
defaute at abusy^n^ and dysorder of the (...) that they do yt of ma^yce all
that they d^, to de^troye the church.

This is a goodly ^ false surmyse, grounded as I said upon a cherytable
imagynacion. But for all this, though good temporal men be evil content with
such as are in the spyrytualty naught, with whom the good folk of the
spyrytualtye be as evil content as they: yet I verily trust for all this as I
say, that not the temporaltye nor any one good temporal man, is for them that
are naught among the spyrytualtye, so dyspleased and angry against the
spyrytualtye, that is to wit against the corpse and body thereof, that they
should greatly need to be appeased / nor do not lay the fawtes of noughty
spyrytuall persons, to the rebuke of the hole spyrytualtye / no more then they
would think it reason, that y^ strangers of other realms so should lay the
fawtes of evil temporal folk here to the rebuke of the whole temporaltye, y^
they should grudge and say shrewdely by us for them.

Now if this pacyfyer will say that it is not like / and will say that we be
not sewtely y^ temporaltye and spyrytualty of this realm / but that we be much
better for our part then the spyrytualty be for theyrs: the temporaltye shall
not be dispraysed for me. For I trust that though in respect of the goodness
that gods benefytes unto man requires of men again / and in respect of the
constaunce and perseueraunce in virtue that men should hold fast and keep,
there are few or none good in neither another part: yet in such kind of
goodness as the frayltye of our nature suffers in this world, now up now
down, now falling by sin and now rysynge again by grace, the temporaltye
is good I trust and the spyrytualtye both, for all that there lacks not a
sort of some such as are very desperate deuylysshe wreches in both / as no
man dowteth but there was a very good church of Christ in his blessed apostles
days, and yet were there (...) many full very naught and stark heretykes to
therein.

And as for the dyfference in goodness bytwen them and us, god knows the
better and the wu^se both. But strangers of other countries that come hycther
and se both (saving some that have come both out of France and Flanders,
and have here be put in trouble by the spyrytualty for bryngyng in of Luthers
gospe^) other strangers else I say when they have considered y^ spiritualty
of this realm, and compared the^ in their minds not only with the
temporaltye of the same, but also with the spyrytualtye of their own
countries, have said that our spyrytualtye may without any special
reproach, show their facys among other folk. And therefore that the whole body
of y^ spyrytualltye of this realm is so far fallen in the grudge and
indygnacyon of the hole temporaltye, as this pacyfyer speaks / I neither se
cause why it should so, nor yet believe that it is so, nor think it either good
or honorable for this realm that other realms should wene it were so

But where as this pacyfyer speaks of appeasyng: I pray god that some of the
spyrytualtye have not in some things gone about ou^r myche to appease that
sort of p^ple, by whose meanys they have thought that all their ^is^ase has
come / those folk ^ ^aye of whom by good informacyon they have had dete^ted
unto them for ^ery stark here^ikes in deed / who^ yt for any fere of such
other folks false suspycyon spryngynge upon such slaunderouse lies as this
pacyfyer speaks of, and grou^deth his conclusyons upon, the clergy begin to
spare / and for any ^uc^e causes begin to slak^, and be the mo^e remiss in the
calling* attachyng, and cra^myny^ge, and of the ferther o^d^rynge of
heretykes, god will not fail to make fall in their necks the dowble slander
of that from which they fle. For when they wa^e so faint hearted in his great
cause of repressynge of heresies and maynteyn^nge of his faith, that they
forbere their dewty for fere of false slaunderouse words / god will than make
them fall into the more slander, by the self same meanys by which they fle
fro the less. For instede of the false slander of evil men and here^ikes
that they fere in the pursewynge / god will send them a true slander, and
make them be dyffamed among good men and catholyk^s, for their slack and
remysse handelyng. And ferther if they fall into y^ folly that the prophet
reproves, and ceace to call upon god for strength, and then tremble for dread
where there is no perell, and for any dread of men which if they not only would
slander the^ but beat them and kill them to, can yet kill but the body and
than have spette all their poysen, would forgete the fere: god (which when he
has slain the body may send y^ soul into everlasting fire) if (which our
lord forbede) any bishop fall in this fere and cowardyse of faint heart,
that for a^y worldly fere they suffer to be blown out the light of his
lant^rne of faith, he will no^ fail to make fall upon them the terryble
commynacyon and thrette that the spyryt speaks of in the Apocalypse unto the
bishop of Ephesye, I will come and remove thy candelstycke out of his place.

The.xxxiiii. chapter.
NOw where this pacyfyer here surmyseth, y^ the spyrytualtye does most
co^munely nothing ellis, but malycyousely mysconstre the minds, and therefore
malycyousely persecute and pursew the bodies of all them y^ find defaure at
their dysorder and abusyons: y^ vntrewth of this surmyse well and plain
appears by this that every man daily hereth, that there is not in all the
clergy any man that uses to preach the wo^de of god, but that as he touches
the ^autes of the temporalty, such as he sees in that audye^ce metely to be
spoken of / so touches he in like w^se the f^utes of the spyry^^alty / and is
for his so doing not ha^ed o^ the spyrytaulty, no more then of the
temporaltye, but well commended of both. But of troth, he y^ would ey^^er upon
the spyrytualty alone, or upon the temporaltye alone, or upon any one part
of either the tone or the the other, as of only kings, or only dukes, or only
lords, or only ge^tylmen, or only men of law, or only marcha^^tes, make h^s
whole sermon, when that one part only were not his whole audyence / and would
by that part among all folk say many shrewed things by manner of
exhortacyon to thame^dynge: though euyl^ folk and malycyouse would have a
pleasure to here y^* yet would no good folk and indyffere^t think that he did
well / and specially if he would use that manner, where him self pretended that
all the remanaunte of his audyenc^ were in grudge and diuysyon al ready against
that one part / whose fautes and vices all his whole sermon holyly puts in
all the peoples earys to mytygate their hatered with / and with such
prea^hynge so to make the peace in like manner wise, as y^ he fownde a corner of
his neighbors house burning, he would of great love and polycye lay on
fagottes and gunpowder to put out the ^yre.

The.xxxv. chapyter.
NOw where this pacy^yer upon that mysse ymagyned surmyse, goth on farther and
says, that because the clergy so mysse constreweth the minds of all those y^
find f^ute a^ their mysse order and abusyons, therefore they (...) yt a good
d^de to se them punys^hed* and they* have therefore punyshed many pers^ns,
which myche people have judged them to do upon will and not of no ^^ue to the
people: in these words how charitably this pacyfyerment I can not tell / but
either by malice or ouersyght, either by defau^e of him self or craft of some
sotle shrewe, these words are as evil and as malycyously written, as any one
y^ would feign falsely dyffame the clergy could ymagyne or deuyse.

For here he says that because they have (as him self bears them in hand)
conceived a false suspycyon against all those that find fault at their
mysseorder and abusyons / therefore they not only have persecuted and punysshed
many persons, but also think their wrong full persecucyon and vnryghtuouse
punyshement well done. what can be worse done then this? and therefore as this
doing were the worst that could be, if yt were true / so is this saying the
very worste that can be sith yt is very false.

And in these words the figure of some say will not well serve him / and yet in
yt comes here also myche augme^ted and increased, in that he says not that
some men so say, but that myche people so ^udgeth. How be yt as I said this
figure will not serve him here. But he plays like a wyly thief, that because
he would not be known would were a vysour / and yet forgetyng him self, would
first come forth bare faced / and when every may had seen him and marked him
well, would then put on his vysour a pace, and cover his vysage to walk awa^
unknown. Even thus wisely lo plays this pacyfyer here. For first he says
as of him self, that the clergy has punyshed many persons therefore / that is
to wit for the evil and false susspycyon that they have conceived against
all those y^ find fault in the^r misseorder and abusyons. And when he has
thus said as of him self, and thereby well showed him self / then to cover
and color yt with, he says that much people judges so. And therefore his
whole tale amounts unto no more, but that him self first affermeth yt, and
after confermeth his affermac^on by the pretense that myche people judges the
same / of which myche people he names yet never one, nor proves that myche
people so does, nor shows cause wherefore either myche people or little people,
or any one person so should / but brings forth a bare surmyse in such wise
ymagyned against the clergy, as every man that list to lie, may sone ymagyne
in some other matter against any temporal men.

But as for his myche people I set not myche by. For much people may sometime
b^leue some one mannys lie. And against his much people, if there were myche of
them that so judge before the prof^ and fish before the net, and set the
carte before the horse, as I wene there is not: yet is there against them myche
other people more wise in that point, and more cyrcu^specte, which till they se
such an evil tale proved true, will either of indyfferencye keep them self
in a stay, and suspend their s^nte^ce for the season, or else o^ a good mind
rather for the while think and believe the contrary.

Lettynge therefore for this time his much people pass / I would now demand
of him how he proves this abominable fawte that he lay^th here to the
spyrytualtye him self / where he says plainly y^ they* have punysshed many
persons therefore, that is to wyt^e for the thing that he there has rehearsed /
which is ye wot well, because they have he says conceived a false suspycyon
against them, for fyndyng defaute at their mysseorder and abusyons, and take
it as though they loved not the clergy* but of malice would destroy the
church and have their goods and possessions them self.

Now if the clergy have therefore punysshed many persons, because the same
persons have only spoken against their mysseorder and abusyons / and that the
clergy have therefore mysse co^strued their minds, and imagyned that they would
destroy the clergy for their possessyo^s, which those other folk that spoke
against their mysseorder went about with those words to get fro the clergy
to them self: if the clergy did I say for this cause of their own false
imagyned suspycyon, punysshe those many persons that this pacyfyer speaks of,
what thing in this world could they do that were worse? and therefore sith
that saying against the clergy is an intolerable dyffamacyon but if that be
true / I ask this pacyfyer by what mean he proves it true.

And first to show that in some part at the lest his words appear false /
every man knows that some of those y^ have been punyshed, have been such, as
neither if the clergy lost their lands should have any part thereof them self
/ and were of such well known noughtynesse and lewd living bysyde, that no
good man could think it lykely, that such folk as they were should do it for
any devotion / as was sir Thomas Hytton that was waxen a ioynour, and in many a
day neither said ma^ens nor mass, but raged and rayled against the blessed
sacrament / and Blofelde ^hapostata that was abiured in London, and after
rayled against all relygyons at Ipswych, and thereupon taken and emprisoned at
Norwich / and Bayfelde the monk and apostata, that was as an a^^ured and after
perjured and ^elapsed heretyke, well and worthily burned in Smythf^lde: these
with diverse such other as have been punysshed for heresye, have been none such
as the clergy neded to punysshe them for fere that they should get from them
any part of their lands to them self, nor were of such wys^ome, lernyng,
nor virtue neither y^ the clergy could fere y^ any men of wit or of autho^yte,
would any thing regard their words / but only that the clergy fered, that by
their means might grow the loss and destruction of many light persons
souls.

For if this pacyfyer will say, that the clergy fered lest those folk and
many such other like, should conspyre and gather together, and pull all away
from them by force: I can not say nay but such a thing might in deed by long
sufferaunce come about, as well in this land as (...) has in other. But than
if the clergy feted y^ thing / they fered for mo than them self. For surely
if such thing should fortune as I trust it never shall / those folk would
not take only fro the clergy, but among other from some of their own lay
brethren to, such as have aught to lose.

But this pacyfyer will peradventure say, that though such manner folk as
evil prestes and apostatas that the clergy have punysshed, be none of those
that they pun^sshed for y^ cause, but because they were heretykes in deed / yet
many other have they punys^hed for that cause, that is to wit because they
mysse construed their minds and rekened them for enymyes to the clergy, for
only findyng of fawtes at the mysse order and abusyons of the clergy. And he
will say as he says, that not only him self says that the clergy have
punysshed many persons therefore / but that also much people (though they say
not so far as he says* that is to wit y^ they punys^hed them therefore)
w^l yet say that they punysshed them rather of will than of love to the
people, well yet the ^ame much people if this pacyfyer have herd them so say,
thou^h their so saying be grounded but upon imaginacyon and gessyng at the
secretys of other men's minds (as* his own imagynacyon is) yet judge they
not so evil as him self does. For if they judge in that punyssheme^t no more,
but less love to the people then desire to punisshement / they judge not yet
that the punysshers did the parties wrong as this pacyfyer does him self,
that says the clergy mysseconstrued their minds, and upon such
myssetakynge of their minds for only speaking against their mysseorder and
abusyo^s, did therefore punysshe them.

And therefore lettynge as I said before his much people pass by about their
other bysynesse / I ask this pacyfyer him self, sith he says that the
clergy has for that ^ause punysshed many, what number is the le^te that he
calls many? For though very few be over many to be so wrongfully^
m^ssehandeled and punysshed* for only sp^kynge against mysseorder* and
abusyons / yet^ eue^^more this word many, must^ needs importe and sygnyfye
some greter number ^erdye than one or two or three.

And over this, because the matter wheruppon this pacyfyer brings yt in, is
for a ^ause of a great and in ma^e^ universal grudge and diuysyo^, now of late
(as he says) s^rong^^ up and grown between the spyrytualtye and the
tempor^l^ye / these many persons that he speaks of, whych^ have been so late
for only speky^ge against mysorder and abusyo^s punyshed, must needs ^e so
many as that there have been some such so punyshed almost in every (...). For
else he plain re^roueth his own process, and excuses the clergy him self
v^ware / and lays no little ^au^e in the temporalty, if for the wrongful
demeanoure of one bishop or ^wayn in one person or ^wayne, they would ^ere ^n
universal* grudge against all the remanaunt.

Now to prove to wha^ pass this pacy^yer could bring his proc^sse of his
many persons, so sore myshandeled and p^nyshed for only sp^kynge against
mysseorder and abus^o^s of the clergy / let this p^cy^yer peruse and rehe^se by
name all the dyocises of england and wales therwyth, and I wene verily that
except London and Lyncoln^, he shall scante in any one of all the ^emanaunt
find punyshed for heresye four persons in five year, and in the more part of
them not five in.xv. year / nor delivered into y^ seculare hands in the most
part of them any one in.xx. year. And then ^f this be thus, all though (which
I trow no man thinks) of all those that in all the other dyocises have been
punyshed were wronged every chone / yet were not so few lykely to have made so
great an universal grudge, as this pacy^yer speaks of. For I suppose no man
doute^h, but that by one occasion and other, m^ men then so many, have miss
happed to be in less space mysse punyshed in so myche space of the land by
temporal men / and yet has there not growe^ any universal grudge or
dyuisyon against any part of the people thereby.

Let us now then come to those two dyocises of London and Lyncoln^ / and of
those twain first to speak of Lyncoln^, as great a dyocise a^ yt is* and as
many shyres as he has with i^ yt, yet have I not her^e of late many punysh^d
for heresy among them all. But about a ten year a go to my ^eme^b^au^ce,
there we^e in that dyocise about. (...) or ^ourten abiured in o^^ town / and at
that time euer^ man that I herd speak th^^ of either in y^ court or else
where, appeared very glad that such a bed of snakes was so ^ound ou^ and
broken. For then were there at that time no (...) to pu^te forth books and
lament such dyuysyons, with laye^g for a cause of y^ grudge, y^ many persons
were mysse handeled and punyshed for only speaking against the mysse order
and abusyons of the clergy. But now every one y^ is punished any where, is
enough for a matter of a lamentable book of dyuysyon, that may to pacyfye y^
grudge^re yt bygynne, use a fyguer of some say, and they say, and many say, and
myche people says, and many men think, and such other / and therewith enueygle
y^ reder, and ^ake some good ^olke wene that right were wrong and every one man
an hundred.

But now come I to the dyocise of London, in which though there have been
somewhat more a do in these matters there is no great marvel, sith unto this
dyocise there is so great resort and confluence, not only from other parts
of this realm, but also from other lands. And yet even here of all that has been punyshed in this dyocyse, either in the countye of Essex (for as for in
Myddelsex I remember none) or in the city self, ^yther of resyau^tes therein
or of resorters thereto, English men or strangers, sith this pacyfyer
affermeth that many persons be punysshed by the clergy for the only spekyng
against their abusyons and mysseorder / and of those that have been punyshed
either right or wrong, far the most part have been here double and treble I
trow to all the remanau^t of the whole realm / and this is here next at
hand, whereby the proves of all such myssehandelynge ma^^ here with les^e
labor and charge be brought forth, and the tre^th most easily try^d: ^^tte
^hys pacyfyer of those many myssehandeled and (...) punyshed persons that he
speaks of, come forth and here prove us some. Let him prove.xx. let him prove
x^. let him prove.x. let him prove sy^, let him prove (...) / or for very
shame aft^r such a great word of (...), let him prove some one at the l^^^e. But
surely I suppose he sh^^l never be able to do that.

The.xxxvi. chapyter.
BUt I suppose in good faith that this pacifyer ha^h of some facylyte of his
own good nature, ben easy to believe some such as have told him lies / and has been there b^ persuaded to think* that many other folk said and knew the
thing that some few ^old him for very treuth. And surely they that are of this
new bretherhed be so bold and so shameless in lyenge, that who so shall here
them speak and knows not what sect they be of shall be very sore abused by
them.

My self have good experyence of them. For y^ lies are neither few nor small,
y^ many of y^ blessed brethern have made, and daily yet make by me

Diverse of them have said that of such as were in my house while I was
chancellor, I used to examyne them with turmentes, causynge them to be
bo^^den to a tree in my gardyn, and there pituous^y beten.

And this tale had some of those good brethren so caused to be blown about,
that a right wurshypfull friend of mine did of late within less than this
fourtenyghte, tell unto another nere friend of mine that he had of late herd
much speaking thereof.

what can not these brethern say, that can be so shameless to say thus? For
of very troth, al be it that for a great robbery, or an heyghnouse murder, or
sacryledge in a church, with caryenge away the py^e with the blessed
sacrament, or (...) casting it out, I caused some time such things to be done
by some officers of the marshalsy or of some other pryso^s with which
ordering of them by their well des^rued pain, and without any great hurt
that afterward should stycke by them, I found out and repressed many such
desperate wreches, as ^llys had not failed to have gone ferther abroad, and to
have done to many good folk a great deal much more harm: yet though I so did
i^ thieves, murderers, and robbers of chyrches / and notwythstandynge also that
heretykes be yet much worse then al they, yet saving only their sure keeping,
I never did else cause any such thing to be done to any of them all in all my
life, except only twain / of which the tone was a child and a serua^nt of
mine in mine own house, whom his father had ere ever he came with me,
nowseled up in such matters, and had se^te him to attend upon George Iaye or
Ge^ otherwise called Clerk, which is a priest, and is now for all y^ wedded in
Antwarpe / into whose house there, the two nonnys were brought, which John^
^yrt otherwise called A^ryan stale out of their cloister to make them
harlo^tes. This George Iay did teache this child his ungracious heresye
against the blessed sacrament of the altar / which heresye this child
afterward being in service with me, began to teache another child in my house,
which uttered his counsel. And upon y^ point perceived and known / I
caused a servant of mine to strype him like a child before mine household, for
ame^dement of him self and ensample of such other.

Another was one, which after that he had fallen in to y^ fran^ike heresies,
fell soon after in to plain open fra^sye bysyde. And all be it that he had
therefore ben put up in bedelem, and afterward by betynge and correccyon
gathered his remembrance to him, and began to come again to him self /
being theruppon set at lyberty and walking about abroad, his old fansyes
began to fall again in his head. And I was fro diverse good holy places
a^^er^ised, that he used i^ his wandering about, to come into the church,
and there make many mad toys and tryfles, to the trouble of good people in
the dyuyne service / and specially would he be most besy in the ^yme of most
silence, while the priest was at the secrets of the mass about y^ le^acyo^.
And if he spy^d any woman knelynge at a form / if her h^d hynge any thing
low in her medytacyons, tha^ would he stele behind her, and if he were not
le^^ed would l^boure to lift up all her clothes and cast them quyte oue^ her
head. wheruppon I being aduertysed of these pageau^tes, and being sent unto and
required by ^ery devout relygyouse folk, to take some other order with him /
caused him as he came wa^deryng by my door, to be taken by the co^stables and
bounden to a tree in the street before the whole town, and there they stryped
him with roddys therefore till he waxed were and somewhat longer. And it appeared
well that his remembrance was good enough, save y^ it went about in grasynge
till it was beten home. For he could tha^ very well rehearse his fawtes him
self* and speak and trete very well, and promise to do afterward as well. And
verily god be thanked I here none harm of him now.

And of all that ever came in my hand for heresy, as help me god, saving as
I said the sure keeping of them / and yet not so sure neither but that George
constan^yne could stele away: el^ys had never any of them any strype or
stroke given them, so much as a ^ylyppe on the forhed.

And some have said that when Co^stantyne was gotten away, I was fallen for
anger in a wonderful rage. But surely though I would not have suffered him go
if it would have pleased him to have tarried stylle in the stocks / yet when he
was neither so feeble for lack of meat but that he was strong enough to break
the stocks, nor waxe^ so lame of his leggys with ^yenge but y^ he was ly^hte
enough to lepe the wallys / nor by a^y myssehandelyng of his h^d so dulled or
dased in his brayn, but that he had wit enough wha^ he was onys out, wisely
to walk his way: neither was I than so heavy for the loss, but that I had
youth enough left me ^o were it out / nor so angry wtih any man of mine y^ I
spoke the^ any evil word for the matter, more then to my porter that he should
se the stocks me^ded and locked fast, that the prisoner stale not in again.
And as for Co^stantyne him self / I could in good faith good thank. For
never will I for my part be so unreasonable, as to be angry with any man that
ryseth if he can, wha^ he fyndeth him self that he sytteth not at his ease.

But now tell the brethern many meruaylouse lies, of myche cruel tormentynge
that heretykes had in my house so farforth that one Segar a book seller of
Ca^brydge which was in mine house about four or five days, and never had
either bodily harm done him, or foul word spoken him while he was in mine
house, has reported syns as I hear say to diverse, that he was ^ou^de^ ^o a
tree in my gardeyn, and thereto to pyt^ousely beten / and yet beside that
bounden about the head with a cord and wrongen, that he fell down deed in a
swowne.

And this tale of his betyng, did Tyndale tell to an old acquaytaunce of his
own, and to a good lover of mine / with one pyece farther yet, y^ while the
man was in betynge, I spyed a little purse of his hanging at his doublette,
wherein the poor man had (as he said) five mark* and that caught I quyckely
to me and pulled yt from his doublette, and put yt in my bosom, and that Segar
never saw yt after / and therein I trow he said true, for no more did I neither
nor before neither, nor I trow no more did Segar him self neither in good
faith.

But now when I can come to goods by such goodly wa^s / it is no great
marvel though I be so suddenly growe^ to so great substance of richesse, as
Tyndale told his acquayntau^ce and my friend / to whom he said that he wist well
that I was no less worth in money and plate and other mouables, then twenty
thousand marks. And as myche as that have diverse of the good brethren
affermed here never home.

And surely this will I confess, that if I have heped up so myche good to
gether / then have I not gote^ the tone half by right. And yet by all the
theuys, murderers, and heretyques, that ever came in my hands, am I not I
thank god the rycher of one grote, and yet have they spent my twayn How be yt
if either any of them, or of any kind of people else, that any cause have had
before me, or other wise any medelyng with me, find him self so sore grieved
with any thing that I have taken of his / he had some time to speak thereof.
And now sith no man comes forth to ask any restytucyo^ yet, but hold their
peace and slack their time so long: I give them all plain peremptory warn^nge
now, that they dreue y^ of no longer. For if they tarry till yesterday, and
then come and ask so great somes among them, as shall amount to twenty
thousand mark / I purpose to purchase such a proteccyon for them, that I
will leave my self less then the fourth part, even of shrewden^s, rather then
ever I will pay the^.

And now dare I say, that if this pacyfyer had by experyence known the
truth of y^ kind of people / he would not have given so myche credence to
th^yre lamentable co^playnynges, as yt seems (...) by some of his Some says
he does.

How by yt what faith my words will have with him in these mine own causes, I
can not very surely say, nor yet very gre^tly ca^e. And yet stand I not in so
myche dout of m^ self, but that I trust well that among many good and honest
men, among which sort of folk I trust I may ^eken him / mine own word would
alone even in mine own cause be somewhat better byleued then would y^ oaths of
some twayn of this new bretherhed in a matter of a another man.

The. xxxvii. chapyter.
BUt now to come to some spyrytuall men's causes, against whom there are laid
like lies / one Symondes a long well known heretyke walking about the realm,
way taken not long ^go, by y^ officers o^ the right reverend father my lord
bishop of winchester / and being put in a chamber to keep, and brekynge out
at a wyndow, has told many of his brethren syns, that he was meruaylousely
tormented by the bishops officers in prison, and should have been murdered
therein to, and that else he would never have run his way. But he would never
syns complain of his harms to the king or his counsel / but will rather of
perfeccyon suffer them al pacyently, then (...) pur^ew and prove them with his
forth coming again.

would god this pacyfyer might have thexamynacyon of that matter. It would
peradventure do him great good hereafter, to find out the truth of such a
false heretyques tale.

And now not wythstandynge that the brethern boste myche of his happy escape:
yet if he happed to dye or be hanged somewhere there as no man wyste where but
they, they would not let for a need to say that he escaped not at al, but was
priuyly killed in prison, and pryuyly cast away. For so said some of them by
George Constantine, not only upon his first flight out of my keeping, but also
even now of late, not wythsta^dyng that they well know that many merchants
of our own had seen him syns laugh and make merry at Intwarpe.

Such lust have these blessed brethren y^ ever talk of faith and sprete and
troth and veryte, continually to deuyse and imagyne lies of malice and
hatered, against all those that labor to make the^ good.

And such a pleasure has either Fryth him self or else some other false
^olysshe brethren of his sect. For he told one or twayn, and caused the
brethren to blow it ferther about, that word was sent him into the tower,
that the chau^cellour of London said it should cost him the best blood in
his body.

Now whyther Fryth lied or his fellows, let them draw cut between them. For
surely where they tell it under such manner, as though master chancellor
shoide reloyce and have a cruel desire of the man's death: I know him so well
that I dare well say they falsely by l^e him ther^n.

How be it some treuth they might hap to here wheruppon they might build
their lie. For so was it that on a time one came and showed me that Fryth
labored so sore that he swette again, in studyeng and writing against the
blessed sacrament. And I was of troth very heavy to hear that the young
folysshe fellow should bystowe such labor about such a deuelysh wurke / and
wys^^hynge that the man had some good christen friend to whom he would give
ear, that might with draw him from geuynge and enclynynge all his heart to
y^ following of that frantyke heresye, wherwyth he were in perell to perysshe
both body and soul, said in the co^munycacio^ these words or other of like
effect: For if y^ Fryth quod I sweet in laboryng to quench y^ faith, that all
true christen people have in Christ's blessed body and blood, which all
christen folk verily, and all good folk frutefully receive in the form of
bread: he shall labor more t^an in vain. For I am sure that Fryth and all his
fellows, with all the friends that are of their affinite, shall neither be able
to quench and put out that faith. And over that if Fryth labor about the
quenchynge thereof till he sweet / I would some good friend of his should show
him, that I fere me sore that Christ will kyndle a fire of fagottes for him, and
make him therein sweet the blood out of his body here, and strayte from thense
send his soul for ever into the fire of hell.

Now in these words I neither meant nor mean / that I would it were so. For so
he^p ^e god and none otherwise but as I would be glad to take more labor
loss and bodyly pain also, then peradventure many a man would wene, to win that young man to Christ and his true faith again, and thereby to
preserve and keep him from the loss and perell of soul and body both.

Now might it peradventure be, that I told master chancellor this tale,
and so I wene I did / and he might theruppon happen to report it again, or
say some such like words of like purpose to some other man / and that there
upon these brethren buyelde up their tower of lies. Or else which were
not impossyble, Fryth if he herd the tale told by me, might wythdrawynge the
best, and making it seem such as him self list, tell it out by master
chancellor, to bring him among the people in opynion of malice and
crueltye. But his mylde mind and very tender dealing in such matters, is
among all the people by good experyence so plainly proved and so clearly
known, that it will be hard to bring any such synyster opinyon of him in any
good honest mann^shed, for the words of a great me^nye such manner folk as
Fryth is / which not only speaks lies against honest men, but also writes
false l^es and heresies against the blessed sacrament of the altar.

Some man will yet peradventure say, that this is a thing far, unlikely,
that eyth^r Fryth or any man else would wyt^yngly take a bourden from one man and
lay it in a another mannys neck^ / and namely to lay it to the chau^cellour
for me, sith that all (...) folk reken in them self, that they have more cause
of gr^efe against me then him.

Surely if they were wise and ente^ded to be good / they should neither think
them self to have cause of gryefe or grudge against me nor him neither. For
of my self (...) wore well, and of him I b^leue the same, that we no^^ynge
entende unto them (...) own welthe / which (...) their amendment of (...) of
their heresies (...) the ^rewe faith again, is impossyble to be gotten.

But for the point that I spoke of, y^ it were not so far unlikely as it
would happily some, that Fryth would turn y^ tale fro me to master
chau^cellour / ye shall perceive partly by his own deed, and partly by the
dealyng of some other such i^ such like manner of matter. For ye shall
understand, that after that Fryth had written a false folysshe treatyce against
the blessed sacrament of y^ altar / I having a copy thereof ^ent unto me, made
^^ortely and answer thereto.

and for because y^ his book was not put abroad in prent / I would not
therefore let mine run abroad in men's hands. For as I have often said,
I would w^sshe that the common people should of such heresies never here so
myche as the name. But for as myche as that thing is impossyble to provide but
that heretics will be doing / therefore are other folk sometime dreuyn of
necessyte to speak of those matters also, and to make answer unto them.

And therefore when heretykes abjure and do their penance / the prechour is
feign to rehearse their opynyons in the pulpet, and there answer those
deuelyshe arguments openly, with which those heretykes first deceive men and
wom^n in corners secretly, and after sprede the^ abroad in audience by defense
of those heresies i^ their examinacio^ openly.

And also if their books be ^nys put abroad in prente / it is a thing very
hard to get them well in again. But as for me, I used therein this
prouysyone for the remedy on both parts, that though I would not put mine
answer abroad into every man's hands at adventure, because Frythes book was
not put out abroad in prente: yet I caused mine answer to be pre^ted under
mine own name, to thentent I might as in deed I have, give out some to such
as I perceived had seen his book before.

Now happed it that upon ^ time, the right reverend father my lord bishop
of wynchester, sent for Fryth unto his own place, of very fatherly favor
toward the yo^ge mannys amendem^^ / which he fore desired, bo^e for other
causes, and among other causes partly also for this, because he was not many
years ago a young ^oye waiting upon him and ^ scoler of his. In that
commu^^nicacio^ what words were between them were now to long to rehearse. But
^uch they were as I would wysshe that a^l such as be wise, and wene y^ Fryth
were wise (which be peradventure some that here the brethren speak of him,
and way not them self his words) had there standen by and herd. For they
should I am sure have taken Fryth ever after, for such as he plainly before
good record proved him self than / which was not an heretyke only, but
bysydes that a proud unlearned fool.

But as I was about to tell you, in that comunycacyon my said lord of
wynchester among other things co^muned with Fryth against his before remembered
heresye y^ he so sweteth in, to impugn the true christen faith concerning the
sacrament of the altar. And when Frith there stood in his heresy, as styffely
as he defended yt folyshely secretly between them twayn / my lord longyng that
the fellows folly might appear, called good and worshippefull witnesses unto
the^. And then because his lord ship perceived Fryth, loath to have it known
abroad out of the bretherhed, as yet at that ty^e that he went about to poysene
the realm with y^ pestilent heresy against the sacrament: my lord I say said
unto him, that yt was now to late for him to think that he cou^^e keep close
/ revoke it Fryt^ (q^od his lordshyppe) ye may and repent yt, and so were yt
well done ye did / but keep it fro knowledge you can not, ye be gone now so
far. For your books of this matter have been seen abroad in many men's hands
/ and that so long, that lo here is an answer all ready made unto yt, and
showed him my book in prent / but of troth he delivered yt not unto him. How
be yt sone after he gate mine answer I can not tell of whom / and syns have I
herd of late, that he sweteth about y^ matter a fresh, and has I here say,
the deuylyshe books of wyclefe, Swynglius, and friar Huyskyn secretly conveyed
unto him into the toure, and has begone and gone on a great way in a new
book against the sacrament.

But the thing that I tell you this tale for is this. I am well informed y^ he
knows very well that I made that answer / and yt is not very lykely but that
by one or other he has the book in prent / and of lykelyhed he never had yt
otherwise. For that was as easy a way ye wot well, as one to write it out
that had it in prent all ready / and before yt was prented I know very well he
could never get it. And at the lest wise I know it well that he knows well
enough that the answer was made by me / and yet he dyssymuleth that, and
faynynge him self not to know who made it, but to think yt rather that my
said lord of wynchester made yt then any man else, makes his new book as I
am very certainly enfourmed, not against me by name, but all against my said
lord, of a solemn pride that he would have his book seem a dysputacyon
between the boy and the bishop.

But there shall not greatly need such a bishop so learned as my said lord
is, to dyspute with any such as Fryth is, for five such books as that is, if
yt be no wyser then was his other, or the^ this his new is either, if it be no
wyser then one tells me, that both can good skyll and has herd a great part
read / nor how so ever he have handeled it, wise will it never be while y^
matter thereof is so false And therefore when y^ book shall hereafter be finyshed
and happeth to come to mine hands, I trust to make almost every boy able to
perceive the false folly thereof, though he cover his roten fruit as close and
as comely as ever any costerdmonger covered his basket.

But this as I said ye may good reders se, that as Fryth takes mine answer
fro me, which him self and every man else knows well for mine, and
imputes yt to the bishop of wynchester: it were not myche unlikely, that he
would when he had herd of a thing that I had said, and when him self had made
yt worse, then change yt fro me and impute it unto master chancellor of
London.

The.xxxviii. chapyter.
Which if he do, he does yt not alone. For this point played also Thomas
Philippis of London letherseller now prisoner in y^ tower* whom when I was
chancellor, upon certain things y^ I found out by him, by thexamynacyon of
diverse heretyques whom I had spoken with, upon the occasyon of the
heretyques forboden books, I sent for / and when I had spoken with him, and
honestely entreated him one day or twayn in mine house, and labored about his
ame^dement in as hearty loving manner as I could: when I perceived finally the
person such that I could find no troth, neither in his word nor his oath,
and saw the lykelyhed that he was in the setting forth of such heresies
closely, a man mete and lykely to do many folk myche harm: I by endenture
delivered him to his ordynary. And yet for because I perceived in him a great
vain gloryouse liking of him self, and a great spyce of the same spyryt of
pride that I perceived before in Richard Hu^ne when I talked with him / and
fered that if he were in y^ bysshoppes prysone, his gostely enymy y^ devil
might make him there destroy him self / and then might such a new besynes
arise against master chancellor that now is, as at that time arose upon
the chauncelloure that was then / which thing I fered in Thomas Philyppys
somewhat also the more, because a cosyn of his a ^arbour in Pater noster row
called (...) John^, after that he was ^u^spected of heresye and spoken to
thereof, (...) the shame of the world drowned him self in a well: ^ for these
(...) aduysed and by my means help, that Thomas Philips (whych^ all be yt
that he sa^d that y^ clergy ^oued him not, s^med no^ yet very loath (...) to the
bishops pr^^on) was received pryso^^r into (...) tower of London. and yet
(...) that he (...) to know how the matter stood. which known and reported to
y^ kings grace / his hyghnes as a most virtuous catholyque prince gave unto
Thomas Philippis such answer, as if he had been either half so good as I would
he were, or half so wise as him self weneth he were, he would forth with have
followed / and not stand still in his obstynacye so long, as he has now put
him self thereby in a another deper parell.

Other have besides this complained, that they have been untruely and unjustly
handeled / and this have they not let to do after that they have been
conuycted and ab^^red, and their just condemnacyons after their open
examynacyons and plain and clear proves, so well and openly known, y^ they
have by their shameless clamoure nothing gotten, but rebuke and shame. And yet
were some of them if their ordynaryes had been so sore and so cruel as this
book of this pacifyer makes them, fallen again in the danger and parell of
relapse.

And some has been herd upon importune clamor, and the cause and handelyng
examyned by the greatest lords temporal of the kings most honorable
counsel, and that sins that I left the office / and the complaynour fou^den
in his complaining so very shameless false, that he has been answered that he
was to easily dealt with, and had wrong that he was no worse served.

And such have these folk ever be fou^den and ever shall. For when they fall
to a false faith in heart / their words can not be true. And therefore if this
pacifier well and thoroughly knew them / I bare say he would less believe their
lamentable ^ales, the^ I fere me that he has byleued some in complaynyng upon
their ordyna^^es, against whom he se^^^th upon such folks false complaynyng,
to have co^cey^^^d this opinion that his (...) of dyuysyon shows, y^ is to
wit* that y^ clergy think that (...) man that speaks against their mysseorder
and abusyons, loves no prestes, and that therefore they have punyshed many men,
which god forbede were true. For if yt were / surely they that so punysshed
any one man for that cause, that is to wit, because them self conceive a
false suspicyon against him / yt were pytye that they lived. But I think in
good faith that the prelates will never desire to live longer, then till this
pacyfyer prove that same false tale true.

The.xxxix. chapyter.
I Said before, that I would towche of this book, and so have I towched, his
first chapyter hole, because it has for the first setting forth the chyefe
countenance of myldenes and charity. And yet what charity there is therein,
when it is considered I suppose you se. For no part is there of the clergy
that can please him, neither prelates, nor mean seculare prestes, nor
relygyouse persons, not so much as any one man / as you may plainly perceive
by other words of his in other places of his loving book. And yet among al
these fautes, I se him find none with them y^ ru^ne out in apostasye / but all
the fautes be assygned in them y^ abide in their professyon still. Nor I (...)
not in his book any cause of his dyuysyon, to be founden in the sowynge and
setting forth of these new sprogen heresies. And yet do they make, and nedys
must make where so ever they come the greatest dyuysyon that can be / first in
opynyons and contraryouse minds, and afterward in fervor of language and
contencyouse words / and finally if it go forth long, in plain sedycio^,
manslaughter, and open war.

And this fault of these heresies he might as well have laid unto y^ clergy,
as some of the the other that he so sore speaks of, if he take heresies for any.
For like as noughty prestes and noughty relygyouse persons, have all way been
they that do those other fautes, which under the ^ygure of Some say this (...)
lays to y^^ charge of the spyrytualty: so have noughty prestes and noughty
relygyouse folk (being among the clergy as Judas was among Crystes
apostles) bytrayed the faith of Cry^te, and bygonne and set forth these
ungracious heresies, as taste and as fervently for their part, as nowghty lay
^olke ^or theyrs / and both twain first corrupt some of their company at
home, and after ru^ne (...) in apostasye, and put^e abroad their heresies in
writing. And some men say (...) some pre^ates have not done all their parts,
in the repressynge and dew punysshement of them. And yet as great fautes as
these be, and such as all the tempoa^tye should be most grieved with and grudge
at, and therefore should be most cause of this dyuysyon, if there be such a
dyuysyon / and that every defaute that is in any noughtye persons of the
spyrytualty be a cause of all most an universal dyuysyon and grudge of the
whole corpse of the temporaltye, against the whole body of the spyrytualtye:
yet I say for all this, the book of this pacyfyer lays no pyece of this
fault unto the spyrytualtye / but rather fyndeth fault and cause of grudge and
dyuysyo^ in the spyrytualty, for over sore handelynge of them that are
heretykes in deed / and laboreth to abasshe the ordinaries with obloquy, and
put them in dread with fere of infamy, and falsely bears them in hand that
they have punysshed many persons for a wrong suspicyo^, falsely conceived in
their own minds against those whom they punysshed.

And thus far has he gone in his first chapyter. In which manner all be it I
trust in god the man meant him self but well / yet I fere me some wyly shrew
has somewhat set him a wry in the temperyng o^ his words.

The.xl. chapyter.
ANd verily all be it as I said before, I purpose not to meddle with every part
of his book y^ I think were well done for him to amend: yet in his seventh
chapyter and his eyghte, which twain create all of these matters of heresies /
for the great weyghte of the matter I shall not forbere to show you some
dyfference and dyuersyte between his mind and mine.

An other occasyon of the said dyuysyon has been / by ^eason of diverse futes,
that have been taken in the spyrituall courts of office, that is called in
latin, ex officio: so that the parties have not known who has accused them /
and theruppon they have sometime ben caused to abjure in causes of beresyes:
sometime to do penance, or to pay great sommes of money for redemynge the^of /
which vexacy^^ and changes the parts have thought have come to them by the
^udges and the officers of the spiritual court: for they have known ^o^e
other accu^ers, and that has caused myche people in (...) parties of this
realm to think great malice and parcyalyte in the spyrytuall judges. And if a
man be ex officio brought before the ordynarye for h^resye, if he be notably
suspected of heresye: he mu^^e purge him self after the will of the ordynarye,
or be accursed, and that is by the law extrade hereti^is. cap. and Ad
ab^sendam. And that is thought by many to be a very hard law, for a man may
be susspected and not gyl^ye, and so be driven to a purgacyon without proof or
without offense in him, ^r be accursed.

I will in this point of co^uentynge ex officio, no ferther speak at this time
than concerning the crime of heresy. For I am in good faith loath to meddle with
this book of his at all. For loath am I any thing to meddle against any other
mannys writing that is a catholyke man, saving that it seems me verily that
be this man never so good, yet if his mind were followed in this matter, it would
wurke this realm great harm and no good.

For surely if the conuentynge of heretyques ex officio were left, and
changed into an other order, by which no man should be called be he never so
sore suspected, nor by never so many men detected, but if some man make him
self party against him as his accuser / the stretys were lykely to swarm
full of heretykes before that right few were accused, or perade^^ture any one
either.

For what so ever the cause be / it is not unknown I am sure that many will
give unto a judge secret enformacio^ of such things, as though they be
true, yet gladly he will not or peradventure dare not, be openly a known that
the matter came out by him. And yet shall he sometime give the namys of diverse
other / which being called by the judge, and examyned as wytnessys against
their wyllys, both know and will also depose the troth, and he that first
gave enformacyon also / and yet will never one of them wyllingly make him self
an open accuser of the party, nor dare peradventure for his earys.

And this find we not only in heresy, but in many temporal matters among our
self / whereof I have had experyryence many a time and often, both in the
dysclosynge of felo^^es, and sometime of much other oppressyo^ used by some one
man or twayn in a shyre, whereby all their neighbors sore smarted / and yet not
one durst openly complain.

How be it, it comes in heresies sometime to much worse point. For I have wist
where those that have been in the company at the time, being folk of good
substance and such as were taken fro wurshypfull, being called i^ for
witnesses, have first made many delays / and afterward being examyned on
their oaths, have sworn that they herd it not, or remembre^ it not, and took
no head to the matter at the time / where as it well appeared by y^ deposycyons
of diverse other being with them at the time, y^^ in every man^^es conscience
they lied.

when would these folk bycome an hertykes accusar, against whom they would
rather be forsworn then of the troth to bear witness.

And this thing makes, that yt may be sometime (all be yt very selde yt
happeth) that in heresy upon other vehement suspycyons without witness, a man
may be put to his purgacyon and to penance also if he fail thereof* which
thing why so many should now think so hard a law as this pacyfyer says they
do / I can not se, nor those wise men neither that made the law. And yet were
they many wise men / and not only as wise, but peradventure many mo also in
number, then those that this pacyfyer calls many now, that as he says find
now the fault. For though yt be alleged in the extrauagat de hereticis ca. Ad
abolend^: yet was that law made in a general counsel.

And verily me thinks that he which can not be proved gyltye in heresye, and
yet uses such manner of ways y^ all his honest neygh^ours wene he were one,
and therefore dare not swear that in their conscience they think him any other
/ is well worthy me thinks to do some penance for that manner of byhauour,
whereby he gives all other folk occasyon to take him for so noughtye.

And by the comen law of this realm, many times upon suspycyon the judges a
ward a writ to inquire of what fame and behauour the man is in his country
/ and him self lies sometime still in prison till the return / and if he be
returned good, that is to wit if he be in a manner purged, then is he
delivered, and yet he pays his fees ere he go. And if he be returned naught
/ the^ use the judges to bind him for his good abe^ynge, and sometime suertyes
with him to, such as their dyscrecyon will allow. And then to lie still till
he find them, is sometime as much penance to the tone, as the spyrituall judge
enioyneth to the the other. For the tone comes to the bar as openly as the
the other to the co^systory / and sometime his feters way a good py^ce of a faggot,
bysydes that they lie le^ger on y^ tone man's legs, then the faggot on the
tothers sholdre. And yet is there no remedy but both these must be done,
both in the tone court and in the the other / or else instead of one harm
(which to him that deserves yt not happeth seldom, and as seldom I am sure
in heresye as in theft, and myche more seldom to) ye shall have ten times
more harm happen dayle to folk as innocent as they / and of innocentis many
made nocentes, to the destruccyon of them self and other to, both in goods
body and soul.

And because this pacifyer takes yt for so sore a thing in the spyrytuall
law, that a man shall be called ex officio for heresye, where he shall not
know his accuser: if we should change the spyrytuall law for that cause, then
had we need to change the temporal to, in some such points as change yt
when ye will, and ye shall change yt in to the worse for aught that I can se,
but if yt be better to have mo theuys then f^wer.

For now if a man be endyghted at a sessyons, and none euydens geuyn openly at
the bar (as many be, and many may well be. For thendytours may have euydence
given them a part, or have herd of the matter ere they came there, and of whom
be they not bou^de^ to tell, but be rather bounden to keep it close, for they
be sworen to keep the kings counsel and their own) shall than the party
that is endyghted be put unto no business about his acquytayles? And who shall
tell him there the names of his accusers, to entytle him to his writ of
conspyracy? This pacyfyer will peradventure say, that the same twelve men that
are his endyghtours are his accusours, and therefore he may know them. ^ut
what helps that his undeserved vexacyon if he were fautelesse? For amends
the law gives him none against any of them, nor it were not well done he
should / but may when he is after by other.x^i. acquyte, go get him home and
be merry that he has had so fair a day / as a man get^eth him to the fire and
shakes his hatte after a shoure of rain. And now as it often happeth, that a
man comes into a shoure by his own ouersyghte, though sometime of chance and
of adventure: so suerly though sometime it hap that a man he accused or
endyghted of malice, or of some lykelyhed which happed him of chance and not
his fault therein / yet happeth it in comparyson very ^elde, but that the party
by some demeanure of him self gives occasion that folk have him so suspected.

Now if this pacyfyer say, that yet here is at the least wise in a temporal
judge an open cause apperyng, whereupon men may se that the judge calls him
not, but upon a marter brought unto him / where as the spyrytuall judge may
call a man upon his own pleasure if he bear the party dyspleasure: this is
very well said as for the te^porall judge. But what says he now for the
temporal.xii. men? For ye wot well they may do the same if they were so
dysposed / and then had I as live the judge might do yt as they. For in good
faith I never saw the day yet, but that I durst as well trust the troth of one
judge as of two iuryes. But the judges be so wise men, that for the avoiding
of obloquye, they will not be put in the trust.

And I dare say the ordynaryes be not so folysshe neither, but that they
world as feign avoid it to if they might / saving that very necessyte lest
all should fall to naught, compels them to take this way / which necessyte
sometime causes also both the temporal judges and the kings counsel, to
put some foke to business or dyshonestye sometime, without either jury or
bringing of the accuser to the prose of the matter in the parties presen^e

For if the judge know by sure enformacyon, that some one man is of such
evil demeanure among his neighbors, that they may not bear it / and yet that
the man is bysyde so violent and so iubardouse, that none of them dare be a
known to speak of it: will there no judges upon many secret complayntes made
unto them, without making the party preuy who told him the tale, bind that
busy troubelouse man to good aberynge? I supposeyes, and have seen it so to /
and wrong would it be sometime with good pore peasyble folk in the cu^trey, but
if it were so done among. And my self when I was chancellor, upon such
secret enformacyo^ have put some out of commyssyon and office of justice of
the peace, which else for much money I would not have done and yet if I were
in the tone rome still and they in the the other again, but if they be mended
(whereof I neither than saw^ nor yet here any lykelyhed) I would put them out
again, and never tell them who told me the tales that made me so to do.

But yet will peradventure this pacyfyer say, that some time in some very
special case, he could be content that the spyrytuall judge should upon his
dyscrecyon call one for suspycyon of heresye ex officio / but he would not have
men come^ly called, but either by accusacyon or presenteme^^ in their senys or
endyghte^ mentes at the common law. I had as lyefe for any thing that I se,
that this pacyfyer should say thus: By this way that they be called I would not
have them called / but I would have them called after such an order as they
might be sure that than should they never be called. For as for accuse folk
openly for heresye, every man has experyence enough, that ye shall seldom
find any man that will / but if the judge should set an offycer of the court
thereto without any perell of expensys / and than were this way and that way
all of one effect. And as for presentementes and endyghteme^tes, what effect
would come of them concerning heresy, ye se the proof I trow metely well all
ready.

For this is a thing well known unto every man, that in every seen, every
sessyon of peace, every sessyon of jail de^yuery every let thorough the
realm, the first thing that the jury have given them in charge is heresye.
And for all this, through the whole realm how many presentementes be there
made in the whole year. I wene in some seven year not one. And I suppose no man
dowteth, but that in the mean time some there be. I will not be curyouse about
the searching out of the cause, why it is either never or so very selde
presented, not five in fyftene year.

But this I say, that sith some will not, some can not, and none does / if he
should put away the process ex officio, the thing should be left undone /
and than should soon after with heretykes encreaced and multiplied, the faith
be undone / and after y^ thorough the stroke of god reuengyng their malice and
our negligence, should by sedycyon, and trouble, and derth, and death, i^ this
realm many men both good and badde be undone. And therefore for conclusyon of
this pyece, my pore aduyce and counsel shall be, that for heresye, and
specially now this time / men shall suffer the processes ex officio stand /
and for as many other synnys also as are only reformable by y^ spyrytuall
law, except there be any such synnys of them as ye think were good to grow.

The.xli. chapyter.
ANd yt appears de heretici^ li.vi. in the chapyter In fide^ fauorem* that
they that be accursed and also parties to the same offense, may ^e witness in
heresy: and in the chapite^ Accusatus perag. licet / yt appears, that if a man
be sworn to say the troth concerning heresy, ^s well of him self a^ ^f
other, and he first confesset^ nothing* and after contrary to his fyr^te
saying he appeleth both him self and other: if yt appear by manyfeste tokens,
that he does it not of lyghtnes of mind, ne of hatered nor for corrupcyon of
money: that then his witness in favor of the faith shall ^^ande / as well
against him self, as agayns^ other: and yet yt appears euy^^^ly in the same
court, and in the same matter, that he is a perjured person.

This is a dangerous law, and more like to cause untrue and unlawful men to
condemn innocents, then to co^dempne offender^. And yt helpe^h little, that
if there be token^, that yt is not done of hatered, nor for corrupcyon of
money: that yt should be taken: for sometime a wolf may show him self in the
apperell of a lamb. And if the judge be parcyall, such token^ may be sone^
accepted then trewly showed.

This pyece concerning the testymony of known evil persons to be received
and taken in heresy / I have some what touched in the third chapyter of the
third book of my dyaloge / where sith they may read it that will, I will make
here no long tale again thereof. But well he woteth that heresye, whereby a
christen man bycometh a false traitor to god, is in all laws spyrytuall and
temporal both, accounted as great a crime as is the treason committed against
any worldly man. And than why should we find so great a fawte, that such
witness should be received in a cause of heresye, as are received not only in
a cause of treason, but of murder also, and of other more syngle felony / not
only in favor of the prince, and ^e^estacyon of such odyouse crimes, but
also for the necessy^e which y^ nature of the matter wurketh in the proof. For
s^th evil folk use not to make good folk of their counsay^e in doing of
their evil deeds / those that are done, should pass unpunished, and molyke be
committed a fresshe, but if they were received for records to their
co^de^pnyng, that were of their counsel and perteuers to the doing. which
kind of folk will not let to swear twyse nay, before they confess onys ye /
and yet their one ye more true upon their bare word, tha^ their twyse nay
upon a solemn oath / and yet confess they not so symply, but that it is
comenly helped with some such cyrcumstaunces as make y^ matter more clear.

Now se you well that as him self shows, the law prouydeth well against
all light receyuynge of such confession. And yet this pacyfyer says that all
that helps little, because the judge may be parcyall, and the wytnes may be a
wolf, showing him self apparelled in the apparel of a lamb, which apperynge
in apparel, poor men that can not apparel their speech with apparel of
rethoryke, use comenly to call a woulfe in a lambs skin.

But what order may serve against such obieccyons? what place is there in
this world spyrytuall or temporal, of which the judge may not have some say
that he is, or at the lest wise (as he says here) may be parcyall? And
therefore not only such witness should be by this reason of his rejected, in
heresy, treason, murder, or felony / but also by his other reason of a woulfe
in a lambys skin, all manner of witness in every matter. For in every matter
may it happen, that he that seems a lamb, may be in deed a woulfe / and be
naught where he seems good / and swear false where he seems to say true.
And therefore this patche of this pacyfy^r concerning witnesses / every wys^ man
may bear wit nesse (...) there is (...) wit therein / and less good would grow
t^erof, if folk would follow his ^uencyon, and make of the laws a change.

The.xlii. chapyter.
ANd in y^ chapyter there, that begins Statuta que^^^, yt is decreed / that
if the bishop or oth^^ enquere^^s of herely, se that any great danger might
come to the accuso^^s or wytnes of heresye by the great power of them that be
accused: that then they may command, that the names of the accus^urs or
witness shall not be shew^d but to the bishop or enquero^rs / or such other
learned men as be called to them, and that shall suffyce / though they be not
(...) to the party. And for the more in^^mpnytye of the said accusours and
witness yt is there decreed / that the bishop or enquerours may enjoin
such as they have showed the names of such wytnes unto / to keep them close
upon pain of (...), for disclosyng that secret without their lycen^. And
^urely (...) / that a man shall be co^d^m^^^d / and not know the names of t^^m
that be cause^^ th^rof.

and though the said law seem to be (...) upon a good consydera^yon for the
(...) of the accusours and witness / (...), that that co^syderacy^n can (...) to
prove the law reasonable.

F^r yt seems that the accusours and wytnes might be saved fro danger by a
noth^^ w^y, and that is by this way. If the (...) or enquer^^^ dread, that the
(...) and wytnes might take hurt / as is said before: then might they show yt
(...) the king and to his counsel / bese^^^^g his grace of help in that
behalf / to ^^ue and defend the accusours and wit^es fro the extort power of
them that be acc^^^d: And if they would do so: yt is not to suppose / but that
the king would sufyciently provide for their sauegarde. But for as myche as yt
should seem / that spyrytuall men somewhat pretend to punyshe here^yes only of
their own power / without calling for any assystence of the temporal power /
therefore they make such laws, as may help forth their purpose / as they
think: but surely that is not the charytable way, to put the knowledge of the
names of the accusours and wytnes fro him that is accused / for if he knew
them / he might percase allege and prove so great and so vehement cause of
racour and malice in them that accuse him / that their sayenges by no law
ought not to stand against him. And that spyrytuall men pretend / that they
only should have the hole inquyry and pynyshement of heresye / yt appears
extra the heretices li.vi. cap. Vt^inquisitionis, perag. Prohibemus: where all
powers, and all lords temporal and rulers be prohybyte / that they shall not
in any manner ^^ke knoweledge or judge upon heresye / sith yt is mere
spyrytuall / and he that inquyreth of heresy / takes knowledge of heresy. And
so the sum called Summa rosella / takes yt titulo excommunicat. perag. iiij.
And if that be ^rew, yt seems then, that all instyces of peace in this realm
be excommunycate: for they by authoryte of the kings commyssyone and also by
statute, inquire of heresies. And I think yt is not in the church to prohybyte
that: for though yt were so / that the temporal men may not judge what is
heresye and what not / yet they may / as yt seems, by their own authoryte
inquire of yt / and inform the ordynarye what they have found. And also if a
metropolytane with all his clergy and people of his dyocyse fell into heresye:
yt would be hard to redress yt without temporal power. And therefore
temporal men be redye and are bound to be redye to oppress heresies, when
they rise: as spyrituall men be. And therefore spyrytuall men may not take all
the thank to them self / when heresies be punyshed / as though their
charytie and power only did yt, for they have thye favor and help of
temporal men to do yt / or else many times it would not be brought about.

The prouysyon of the law that he speaks of, was made as appears upon a
great cause, in the aduoydynge of the great dau^geour y^ might in some
special case happen to those, by whose means heresies were detected and
conuycted. But this law this pacifyer accompteth sore and vncherytable / and
deuyseth as he thinks a better But his deuyce peradventure though it would
serve in some one land, would yet not serve in some other / and they that made
that law, made it as it might serve most generally through chrystendome / where
as this devise though it might serve in England, might not have served well in
many places of Almayne that are perverted synnys, not even while y^ matter was
in a mameryng before the change was made.

But surely that law and other of old made against heresies / if they had
been in Almayne dewly followed in y^ beginning, the matter had not there gone
out at length to such an ungracious ending. And undoubtedly, if the prince,
and prelates, and the noble men of this realm, and the good people of the same,
had not been dylygent in the time of the prince of famous memory king Henry
the.iiii. both to have against heresies those laws of the church kept with
which this pacy^ier fyndeth now these fautes, and also to make great
provisions against it bysyde: it was than very lykely and coming to the point,
as utterly to have subverted the faith in this realm here, as it has done
synnys in any part of Swycherlande or Saxony.

And also the dowte that this pacyfyer puts, i^ excepcyo^s to be laid by
the party against the accu^ours or wy^nesse / sith the knowledge of the party
lacks must be supplied the more effectually by the judges, to inquire and
enserch by their wysedomes, whyther any suspycyon of ^^^yll will or other
corrupcyo^, might led the witness or accusers any thing to depose or do in
the matter. wherein if dylygence be by the judges used / it will be very hard y^
any such thing should be of any weyghte but they shall here thereof, and may
consider the matter according.

And on the the other side, the re^^^dy that he deuyseth for the sureiye of the
wytnessys, should not peradventure make the men so bold, as in a cause of
heresy to meddle in y^ matter, a^aynst some manner of man / but that they rather
would for (...) own surety, keep their own tongues still, than with all the
suretye that could be founden them bysyde, have their parsons dysclosed unto
the party.

And as touching the (...) of this pacyfyer, that the sp^rytualty pretend ^o
that (...) man should have the enquery and punysshem^nt of heresies: the laws
of this realm and the laws of the hole church may w^ll stand together for
awght that I se in them both / and so have they in these matters of heresy god
be thanked hitherto full well. And therefore this pacyfyer seems me to br^ing
i^ this matter to no great purpose now, but if it be either to set some
deuysyon, or else to fill up the lefe. And therefore sith as I said before, I
purpose not in any open englysh book to ransake and rebuke either the tone law
or the the other: I shall let him with that matter alone.

The.xliii. chapyter.
Nevertheless mine intent is not to prove the said laws all holly to be
cruel and unreasonable / for I know well / that yt is right expedyent, that
^^rayt lawe^ be made for punyshement of heresies, that be heresies in deed /
more rather then any other offense / and that the dyscrecyon of the ^^dges
spyrytuall may right well as wage the rygour of the said laws, and use them
more favorably against them that ^e innocents / then against them that be
wylfull offenders / if they will charitably search for the troth. But surely
if the said laws should be put into the ha^delyng of cruel judges, yt might
happen that they should many times punyshe innocents, as well as ofendours /
but I trust in god, yt is not so. Nevertheless whyther yt be so or not*
certain it is / that there is a great tumor among the people that yt is so,
and that spyrytual men punyshe not heresye euely for zele of the says / and of
a love and a zele to the people / with a fatherly pytye to them that so
offend as they ought to do, how great offenders so ever they be / but that
they do yt rather to oppress them that speak any thing against the worldely
power or riches of ^pyrytuall men, or against the great confede^acy, that (as
many men say) is in them to maynteyne yt.

Now his intent is not he says, to prove the said laws of the church
against heresies, wholly cruel and unreasonable / but so myche of them as yt
stands not with his pleasure to approve. And now he is conten^ that strayt
laws ^e made for punyshement of heresies, such as be heresies in deed /
wherein (...) this book of his means two things. One, that he is content they
be sore puny. ^ed if they be condemned. But first he would have them called by
such means, as he sees well they never should be sent for.

And then he would erclude all such witness as were likely to by wray them. And
when that no man shall accuse them, nor no man be received that can prove yt
against them: then when the judge can lawfully conuyete them, he would I trow
be content that they were burned twyse / and so would I wene them self be
content to / for they shall be saufe I now I warraunt you then.

yet a another mystery he m^^neth what so ever yt be, in those words, the
punyshement of (...) that be he^e / yes in^ede

Here would he peradventure have every heresy when th^^e new br^therne were
taken therein, be brought in que^^yon again, and stand in controversy whyther
yt were heresy or not / and that were another good help for them / as though
the church used to lay to their charges the spekyng against some false taith /
or at the lest wise would prove the^ heretics in speking against some such
things as they had never herd of before.

But now he shows why he does not wholly condemn these laws of the church.

But then y^ cause he shows to be such, as he by and by takes yt away. For
he lays the cause to be, for that the judges (if they be good and charytable)
may by their wisdom and goodness mother and temper the rygoure of the laws /
but on the the other side the evil judges may do by those laws he says much
harm. But now what laws are there or may there be, by the abuse of which
none evil judge may do harm.

But then to show that by these laws of the church, myche harm and little
good or none could come / he handeleth (...) so that he would make men wene,
there were not a good indyfferent judge in all the whole clergy. For when he
has showed what hurt an evil judge and a cruel should do by those laws / he
says y^ him self trusts the spyrytuall judges be not such.

How be yt lest we should take him at that word and believe him / he shows us
yet that the comen people with a great rumor say the contrary. And the thing
that he says here under the name of the people and great rumor / that says
he in his first chapyter under the name of many men. And yet immediately before
that / he says myche worse as of him self / affermynge that many persons
have been punyshed by the spyritualty for an evil suspicyon and a false of
their own ymagynacyon, because those many persons so punysshed had before
spoken only against spyrytuall mennys mysseorder and abusyons / which point,
honesty would he should have proved first, and then write yt after.

And now comes he and couertely goth about to make men wene, that no
spyrytuall judges be indyfferent. For thus he says.

And though many spyrytuall men may be found, that have right many great
virtues and great gifts of god, as cha^tytie, lyberalytie, pacyence,
soberness, temperaunce, conning, and such other / yet yt will be hard to
find any one spyrytuall man / that is not infecte with the said desire and
affection to have the worldly honor of prefies exalted and preferred / and
therefore if any lay man report any evil of a pressed, though it be openly known
that yt is as he says / yet they will be more dilyge^t to cause the lay man
to cease of that saying / then to do that in them is to reform that is a
mysse in the priest that is yt spoken of, taking as it were an occasyon to do
the less in such reformacyons / because say men speak so myche against
them: But surely that will be none excuse to spyritual rulers before god, when
he shall ask account of his people, that were committed unto their keeping.

If the best spyrytuall men be such as this pacyfyer here says they be, than
be they a very sherwde sort in deed, if they be all so badde that it be hard
to find any one, but that though any priest be so noughty that his lewdnes is
openly known, yet if any ley man report it / the best spyrytuall men will he
says be more dylygent to cause the ley man ceace of his saying, than to do
their deuoyre to reform the priest / ye and yet more then this, he says they
will do the less toward the amendment of the priest, by cause ley men speak
so myche of it. And this says this pacyfyer him self, showing forth boldly
therein his own open face without any visour of some say. And therefore sith he
says this even by the best / till he prove it somewhat better, this shameful
tale is somewhat shameless dare I say / and somewhat is it folysh to, sith he
says therewith that those which thus will do, have yet among many other great
gifts of god, pacye^ce, soberness, temperaunce, and cunning to. For I am
sure if they have that condycyon, that they be so affeccyonat unto every evil
priest, that they can so evil bear y^ disprayse of his open known
vnthriftynesse, that they will do the less toward his amendment, because ley
men much abhor his lewdenesse: this pacyfier may be pacyent I will not say
nay, and may peradventure have myche conning to / but surely either is this
pacyfyer not very sober, or has his brain otherwise somewhat out of temper,
if he take them (as he calls them) for pacie^t folk or for temperate either.

The.xliiii. chapyter.
ANd yet to bring the spyrytualty in y^ more hatered, and to make the name of
the spyrytualtye the more odyouse among the people / this pytuouse pacyfyer in
diverse places of his book, to appease this dyuysyon withal, alleges
against them that they make great confederacyes among them, to make and
maynteyne a part against the temporaltye / and by such confederacyes, and
worldely polycyes, and strayt correccyo^s, to rule the people and punysshe
them, and keep them under. And this point he brings in here and there in
diverse places, sometime with a some say, and sometime with a they say, and
sometime he says it him self. And I wot not well if he hated the
spyrytualtye in deed (as some say he does, and yet I trust he does not) what
more odyouse thing he might say.

what any one kind or sort of people is there i^ this realm husband men,
artyfycers, merchants, men of law, judges, knights, lords, or other, but
that evil dysposed people might begin against them a sedycyouse murmr /
castyng abroad a suspicyouse babbling, of gatheryng, and assemblynge, and
rownynge, and talking, and finally co^federynge together? and yet all such
suspycyouse bablyng not worth a fether al together when it were well co^sydered.

But in sundry places much he harpeth upon the laws of the church / as
though the spyrytuall laws which the spyrytualty here have made, were a great
cause of this dyuysyon. And than diverse of the laws that he speaks of, be
laws not prouyncyall made by the clergy here, but the laws usual through the
whole church of Christ / whereof the making may not be ^ayed to them / nor men
are not therefore so unreasonable (though those laws were less good thanne
the great wisdom of this pacyfyer could deuyse) as to be angry for them
with our clergy that made them not, but have be bound to keep them.

And as for dyffamyng them with the abuse of those laws toward cruelty, as he
both in his book / there is no great cunning in the making of that lie. For
every ^ole that list, may deuyse and lay y^ like to some other folk wha^ he
will.

Now as for their assembles and coming to gether to the making of their laws
and constytucyons prouincyall / this pacyfyer to lay those for any
confederaeyes, that should be now a cause of this so sudden a late grudge and
deuysyon, were a very far fette inuencyon. For setting a side the
dysputacyon, whyther those constytucyons be so unreasonable as this pacyfyer
would have them seme^ this thing suffyseth against him, y^ there is not I think
verily any one prouy^cyall co^sty^ucyon that he speaks of, that was made, or
to any ma^nys gryefe or grudge put in execucyon, in the time of any of all y^
prelates that are now living. And how could than any of them be any such (...)
or cause of this late spronge^ dyuysyon.

But I suppose he calls those assemblynges at their conuocacyons, by the name
of confed^racyes. For but if he so do / I wot nere what he mean^th by that
word. And on the the other side if he so do / for aught that I se he gives a
good thing and an wholesome, an odyouse heyghnouse name. For if they did
assemble ofter, and there did the things for which such assembles of the
clergy in every prouynce through all cryste^dome from the beginning were
instytute and devised / much more good might have grown thereof, then the long
dysuse can suffer us now to perceive.

But as for my days as far as I have herd, nor as I suppose a good part of
my fathers neither / they came never to gether to co^uocacyon, but at the
request of the king / and at their such assembles concerning spyrytuall
things have very little done. wherefore that they have been in that great
necessary point of their dewty so neglygent, whyther god suffer to grow to a
secret vnperceyued cause of dyuysyon and grudge against them, god whom their
such negligence has I fere me sore offended, knows. But surely this has in
my mind ben somewhat a greter fault in y^ spyrytualty, then diverse of those
fautes which under his figure of some say this pacyfyer has made very great
in his book.

But surely if this pacyfyer (...) those assembles confederacyes / I would not
greatly wyshe to be confederate with them, and their assocyate in any such
confederacyes. For I could never wit them yet assemble for any great winning
but come up to their trauayl, labor, cost, and pain, and tarry and talk and
cetera and so get them home again. And therefore men need not greatly to
grudge or envy them for any such confederacyes.

The.xlv. chapyter.
BUt what fautis so ever this pacyfyer find in the spyrytualty / yet of his
tender pytye he has ever a specy al eye to se that they should not rygorousely
mysse handele such good men as are suspected or dedected of heresy. And
therefore where as in other places he has showed before, y^ they have punyshed
many men of malice, for only speaking against their mysseorder and abusyons:
now he comes in the.vi^i. chapyter / and lest bysyde their malice they
might happen to punyshe them also for their own ignorance, therefore he
teaches the spyrytuall judges one great point concerning heresye and says:

It is a com^n opinion among doc^our^ / that none is an heretyke for that only
that he er^eth / but for that he defends opynatynely his error. And therefore
he that erreth of symp^ycyte may in no wise be said an here^^que. And Summa
R^^ella, in the tyt^e ^ereticus in princip^^, says / that a man may err, and
merit thereby: and he puts this example. If a simple unlearned man hear the
preaching of his bishop, that preaches happily against the faith / and he
byleu^th yt with a ready mind to obey: this man (...) / and yet he erreth: but
that is to be understand where ignorance (...) any thing that is heresy /
though (...) speak yt only of an ignorannce / or of a pussyon / or if he can
by interrogatorye^ (...) questyon^ be driven to confess any thing / that is
prohybyted by the church: anon they will drive him to abjure / or hold him
atteynted without examynyng the intent or cause of his saying / or whether he
had a mind to be reformed, or no^^ and that is a very ^ore way / our lord be
more merciful to our souls, then so greuo^^ely to punyshe us for every light
de^aute.

This process were a pretty pyece, and somewhat also to y^ purpose, if this
pacyfyers doctoring were a good proof, that the spyrytuall judges knew not this
tale before, nor wyste what appertayned unto their part in this matter, until
this pacyfyer taught them this great secret (...) S^mma ^osella, so (...) a
book to find and so hard to understand, that very few men had medeled wych
it before.

But the tale is not so much told of any pride to teach them, as of cheryte
to teach us, to take and believe for true, every false feigned tale with which
any man list to bylye them. For upon this lesson he brings in as you se his
cherycable infamacyon of the clergyes crueltye / making men wene it were so,
under his fair figure of lamentacio^, and great pytye that it were if it
should be so / but yet it is (he says) reported so, and some say that it is
so.

But surely some say again, that like as there is nothing so evil, but that
some may hap to do it / so is there nothing so false, but some may hap to
say it. And some other say also that like as there is nothing so false, but
some man may hap to say it / so can no man say any thing so false, but some
man under precexce of pacyfyenge may hap to repete and report it.

For as (...), all that gaye reported tale that some ley men say that some
spyrytuall men have (...) great desire to have men ab^ured, or to have extreme
punyshement for (...), that if any will witness that a man have spoken any
thing that is heresye, though he speak yt but of ignorance (...) all this tale
though he tell ty but as yt were by some spyrytuall men, yet is yt told to
make all lay men wene that those some spyrytuall men were so great a sum,
that it were some great cause of all this great grudge and dyuysyon, which he
says that the temporaltye now has in this realm against the spyrytualty in
manner universally. wherein he makes yet as I trust in manner an vnyuer sall lie
/ sith I can yet se no such universal cause / and lest cause of all in this
point specially, which most specially as y^ sorest and the most cruel
^eyghnouse point, in sundry places of his book this pacyfyer preaches and
preaceth upon, that is to wit the myshandelynge of men in y^ cause of heresy /
making men wene with his heyghnouse handelynge, that the spyrytuall judges in
this realm handeled that thing so cruelly, that all the world had cause to
wonder and grudge thereat.

But when all his wholesome holy babelynge is done / every man may se these three
things true. First that sith in punysshynge of heresies, there is and a good
while has been, so little besynes in all the shyres of England and walys, both
about examynacyon and punycyon of heretykes, except only London and Essex,
and those are both in one dyocyse / his some spyrytuall men that he would have
seem so great ^ sum, are yet of truth so few, that he seems in manner to
point them with his finger, and might as well in manner rehearse the^ even by
name.

Secundely of those same some so few / yet is there some so learned to whom the
matter most specially pertayneth, that if this pacyfyer keep no more conning
in his breast t^e^ he puts out in his book (as conning as he weneth yt
were) he is no more able to reach some one of those the lessons that long to
the matter, then he that learned to spel, is able and mete to teach a good
master in grammar to read.

Chyrdely y^ al his whole tale of their great desire of men's sha^e or harm,
and of their mishandelynge of men, and of uncharitable dealyng, is a very false
feigned ta^e / and so has been all ready proved and fou^den, in those y^ have had
there surmyse brought forth unto the trial / and so shall be prou^d again I
doubt yt not, when so ever this pacyfyer will fall fro y^ babelyng of a
generalty (wherein he may poi^t and spyce a false tale with suspycyouse words)
and come to the namynge of any one person special, and before any folk
indyffere^t offer him self to y^ proof.

For let him come forth and name any one whom he will / and I warrau^t you
the deed shall show it self, that the spyrytuall judges which had the matter
in hand, were neither such as neded of this pacyfyer to be taught what longed
unto right / nor were so malycyouse and cruel, but that they would be as loath
as him self to do them rygoure or wrong.

And he shall find whom so ever he will name, that has been either punysshed
or abiured, that the matters which have been laid unto them, they have not
been by any subtyle questyons enduced to confess them / but they have been both
well proved against them / and neither have been sleyghte, nor light, nor so
strange artycles and unknown, as they might therein of ignorance or
symplycyte so sore ouershote theymselfe.

But where this pacyfyer speaks of passions and of willing to be reformed:
surely if he will so lyghtely perdon all passyo^s, that he will have no man
punysshed for any thing done or said in a passion, than shall his pytuouse
affeccio^ many times do much harm, by the taking away of the punysshement
whereof y^ fere is ordained to refrayn the passyo^, and to make other also
forbere the like for any such manner passion.

For well ye wot, men fall in aduowtry through such da^pnable passyo^s. And by
the passion of (...) and anger, men fall into manslaughter. And by a passyo^ of
pride, many a man falls to treason. And by the same passion also, men fall
into heresye, and sometime ye wot well fall in a plain fra^sye to. And in
their passions of heresye, they speak vngra^yousely, and contend against the
sacraments, and blaspheme our blessed lady, and our savior him self also,
and horrybly despise y^ holy howsell, and make mockes and mowys of the mass,
and rail on Crystes own blessed body and blood in the blessed sacrament.
will this pacyfyer that all these blasphemouse dampnable heretykes shall be
spared, for such desperate da^pnable passions? If that way were allowed / than
were that (...) most sure, y^ against all the faith most could rail and rage.
For than might it be said that the man was in a great passion.

Now as for wyllyng to be reformed / I dare say that the spyrytuall judges would
gladly se every man, and therein would gladly show them all the favor they
could, but sometime they can not show all the favor that they feign would.
For though they may receive him and save his life at the first time: yet are
they streyghted by the plain law that they may not so do at the second, when
the man is relapsed.

And the laws have determined who shall be taken and reputed for an heretyke,
and who not, as well as this pacyfyer can teach us* and a l^tell better to.
And they have both had a respect and a sure eye to provide, that neither
innocents or plain simple folk should be for any sleyght offense sore
ha^deled or untruely cyrcumue^ted and punysshed / nor that wyly false wreched
heretykes, should by craft and sophems be suffered to seem wise among unlearned
people, and feign simplycyte and say they repent and so be sent away
lyghtely, to go teach their heresies and sow their poison into mennys soulys
again.

For if that way were taken which it seems that this pacyfyer would have, that
every man might be hold excused that would say he spoke heresye of
ignorance, or of ouersyghte, or of symplycyte, or of a passion, or which as
often as he would not defend his heresye and stobornly stycke thereto, or
though he did for the while, would afterward yet offer to be reformed, and
promise y^ he would amend: if all these I say should all way pass
unpunished, the church of Christ at the making of the laws foresawe, and all
chrystendome should shortly find, how little fruit would grow thereof.

And when this pacyfyer has told thus, myche mysse handelynge and crueltye of
the clergy, wherein if he said true it towched yet very few, and has proved it
by a some say of as few / and fyndeth some such things for fautes as if they
were changed after the fasshyon of his book, would of heretykes in many places
for a very few make a very great many / and the lies that heretykes of malice
blow about against their judges, laboreth to make men believe them for true, by
his repetynge and reportynge under a pretext of cheryte: than ends he that
painted process with his devout prayour full holyly and says, This is a very
(...) way / our lord be more merciful to (...) souls, then so greuousely to
punyshe (...) for every light defaute.

When he has proved those evil deuyses good, and those false lies true /
than let this good sir Ioh^^ Some say take his portuouse and his bedys and
pray. But in the mean while those good men whom by such fygurys and such
holy pretertes, he goes about ungodly to dyffame / do ernestely pray god for
him, to give him the grace to c^aunge this evil fasshyon and this very sore
way. And they pray god heartily to be more merciful to this pacyfyers pore
soul* than this pacyfyer is to other mennys / whose sou^ys (believe him self
never so well, and mean he never so well therwyth) ^et his ^ooke go^^^ abou^e
by sowynge of dyssensyon and emboldynge of heretykes, to enfecte and enuenome
with a grudge and hatered against the spyrytualty, and with the cankar of
pestylent poysened heresies / and all against their own salvation.

The.xlvi. chapyter.
FOr here shall ye se to the ferther encoragyng of heretykes, what an other
goodly Some say this good sir John^ Some say fyndeth Lo thus he says.

And here some say / that because there is so great a desire in spyrytuall men,
to have mena^i^^e, and to be noted with he^esye / and that some as yt were of a
poly^ye d^ noise yt / that the realm is full of heretykes, more then yt is in
deed: that it i^ very peryllon^e / that spyrytuall men ^ulde have authorytie to
(...) a man for every light suspeccyon, or complaynte of heresye / till that
desire of punyshement in spyrytuall men be ceased and gone: but that they
should make process against them to bring them in upon pain of cursynge:
and then, if they tarry forty days / the kings laws to bring them in by a
wryt De excommunicato capien do, and so to be brought forth out of the kings
Jail to answer. But surely, a^ yt is somewhat touched before in the.vii.
chapyter, yt seems that the church in time paste has done what they could
to bring about, that they might punyshe heresye of them self / without
calling for any help therein of the seculer power.

And therefore they have made laws that heretykes might be arrested and put
in prison, and f^okes if need were / as appears Clementinis de hereticis.
Capi. Multor^m querela. And after at the special calling on of the spyritualty
/ it was enacted by parlyament / that ordynaryes might ares^e men for heresye:
for some men think, that the said Clementyne was not of effect in the kings
law to are^^ any man for heresy: but if a man were (...) and notably suspected
of heresye, and that there were suffycient record and wytnes agayn^t him / and
there were also a dout that he welde flee and not appe^^^ (...) he might infect
other: yt (...) that he be (...) by the bodye^ but not upon every ^yght
complaynt, that full lygh^ly may (...). And yt will be right expedye^t that the
kynge^ hy^^nes and his counsel (...) specya^ly ^ppon this matter / and not to
cease / (...) yt be brought to more quyetnes then yt i^ yet, and to se with
great dylygence, that pride, couetyse, nor worldly (...) be no (...), nor (...)
be punyshed, ne yet (...)t wylfull o^^enders go not without (...).

In this process lo good readers this pacyfyer decla^e^h, that he would have
the kings hyghnes and his counsel so specially look upon this matter, that
neither innocents should be punyshed, nor yet wylfull offenders go without dew
correccyon* who could end and conclude all his matter more frutefully?

But now the special ways whereby he deuy^eth, that the kings hyghnes and his
counsel should bring this chyng about / betwayne.

The tone is, if they provide that neither men that be proud nor couetouse,
nor have any love to the world, be suffered to be judges i^ any cause of
heresy.

The the other is, that the bysshoppes shall arrest no man for heresy, till the
desire that spyrytuall men have to cause men abjure heresies and to punyshe
them for heresies, be ceased and gone.

And surely I think that his two dyuises will serve suffycyently for the tone
part / that is to wit that none innocents shall be punyshed. But I fere me very
sore, that they will not serve half so suffycyently for y^ the other part, y^ is
to wit that wylfull offenders go not without correccyon.

For now to begin with his first dyuyce, y^ none be susfered to be judges in
cause of heresye, that are proud, or couetouse, or have love to the world /
if he mean of such as have none of these affeccyons with notable enormyte,
then till he prove them that are all ready worse then he proves them yet /
that is to say till he prove yt otherwise by some of their outragyouse deeds in
the dealing and myshandelynge of men for heresy, that he here defameth them
of, then he has yet proved, and that he prove their cruel wrongful dealyng,
otherwise then by some says, or by his own saying: the kings hyghnes and
his counsel can se for all his wholesome counsel, no cause to change those
judges that are all ready, but to leave them still / and the^ serves that diuyce
of naught

And on the other side, if he mean that y^ kings highness shall suffer none
to be judges in cause of heresye, that has any spyce at all, either of pride,
or of couercyse, or any love at all unto this world: heretyques may sit still
and make merry for a little season, while men walk about and seek for such
judges. For yt will not be less the^ one whole wekes work I wene, both to
find such, and to be sure that they be such.

And yt will be somewhat the more hard, because that where as men would have
went soneste to have found them, there this pacifyer has put us out of dout,
that there shall yt be merurylous hard to find any one of them / that is to
wit in a^y part of the spyrytualty, prelates, seculer pres^es, or relygyouse
persons, any one or other. For he says plainly that have they never so many
virtues bysyde / yet yt will be hard to find any one spyrituall man, but that
he is so infected with desire and affection to have the worldly honor of
prestes exalted, that he is through such pride far fro such in difference
and equity, as ought and must be in those judges tha^ this pacyfyer assygneth,
which must have no spyce of pride, couetyse, nor love toward the world. And
then sith in all the spyrytualtye yt will be as he says hard to find any one
/ yt will be ye wot well twyse as hard to ^ynde twain / and yet be they to
few for all y^ realm though they were made justices of Air.

Now if it will be so hard to find any one such in the spyrytualtye / I can
scant believe but that it would be somewhat a do to find many such in the
temporaltye either / and specially not only such but those also that y^ king
might be sure to be such / bysydes y^ there must be tha^ many chau^ges and
many new deuyses of laws for y^ matter, because few temporal men be
suffycyently learned in those laws of the church, by which that matter has
been accustumed to be ordered before. And happily if any such men be so
suffycyentely learned / yet is it possible that those men which are so learned,
are not those y^ are so pure and clean from every spyce of pride, couetyse and
worldely love. And therefore were y^ heretykes lykely thus to make merry a good
while, before there should be found^ good judges for them.

Now as for the ^other point, that bysshoppes should not arreste them / this
would also help to the surety of innocents, as from any trouble of suyt /
and so will it also ferther, if neither bishop nor king arrest them. And in
like wise will it save innocents from y^ trouble of all false endyghtementes,
if no man should be neither for no felony arrested nor endyghted neither.

But than this way would not well serve for the the other side, that wylfull
offenders should not pass unpunished. And thereby sith it would help wylfull
offenders to pass without punysshement / it might hap to punyshe
innoce^tes more sore, than should the trouble of suy^ and wrongful arrestyng do.

But yet is this pacyfyer not so favorable toward folk suspected of heresye,
as to take away the power of the bishop for ever, of arrestynge them, and to
drive the ordynaryes for ever to suecytacyons against heretykes and process of
excommunycacyo^ / but will have he says the bysshoppes power of arrestyng no
longer suspended, than as long as spyrytuall men have that great desire to
cause me^ abjure or to have them punysshed for heresye / as though he had well
proved that they have so, because he says that some men say so.

But now if Some say be no suffycyent proof / than is his tale los^e. For than
he shows no cause why that power of theyrs should in any cause be more
supended now, than in any time here before. and on y^ to^her s^de, if some say
be a good proof / than the suspendynge will be as long as a ^^pryuyng for ever,
sith there shall never be any time ^n which there shall lake one or other some
say to say more than ^routh.

yet is he content at the last, lest every man might spy the perell of his
deuyce, to ^empere his deuyce in such wise, that till the spyritualty ^aue
left their cruel desire (...) ^^^urynge and punyshyng folk for heresye, they
should not be suffered to arreste folk for every light suspycyon, or every
complaynt of heresye. How be it he grants that where one is openly and
notably suspected of heresy, and suffycye^t record and wytnes against him,
and bysydes all that, a dowte that he would fle whereby he might enfecte other:
than he grants it conuenyent that he should be arrested by y^ body. And
therein he brings in the Cleme^tine and the statute, by which the ordynaryes
have power to arreste folk for suspycyon of heresye / and would as far as I
perceive, have the king ^eforme the^ after his deuyce. But yet sith which is a
light suspycyon, and which is an heavy / and which is a light complaynte and
which is an heavy / and which is an open s^spycyon, and which but a preuy, and
which suspycyon is notable, and which is not notable, and which witnesses b^
suffycyent, and which be not suffycye^t, be things that must be wayed by the
spyrytuall judges / and upon their wayenge of y^ matter for light or heavy, must
follow the arre(...) of the party or the leuynge of the arreste: we be come
again as in a mase to the point where we began, that be the matter g^^ate or
small, lest all the while they (...) cruel they should judge (...) heavy and
small great, their arrestynge of any at all must be suspended fro them, and
send them to sue by cytacyon, till men se that same mind of theyrs of
desiring mennys abiuracyon and punyshement utterly changed and ceace / that
is to say till there be no man left that will so myche as say that some men
say that they have not left that mind yet, and make a lie again of them
than, as those some have done that have so said all ready to sir John^ some
say now. And long will it be I warraunt you ere ever all such folk fail.

And therefore sith in the mean season by this pacy^yers good deuyse, heretykes
may go vnarrested / I can not believe that if his way were followed, it would be
any good mean to make that wylfull offenders in heresye should not pass
unpunished, as fast as both in the end of this chapter and the the other before
also* he calls upon the kings hyghnes and his counsel and his parleament,
to look upon this matter after his good aduertyseme^t, and never ceace till
they bring it to effect.

I little doubt but that if the kings highness do as I doubt not but his
highness will do, maynteyne and assyste the spyrytualty in executynge of the
laws, even those that are all ready made against heresies / and command every
temporal offycer vndes him to do the same for his part: though there were
never mo new laws made therefore, yet shall both innocents be saved
harmless well enough, and offendo^^s punyshed to.

The.xlvii. chapyter.
NOw where as this pacyfyer says, that some of the spyrytualty as of polycy do
noise yt, that the realm is full of heretics more then yt is in deed: I think
there is no polytyque man of the spyrytualty that will make that noise, whereby
the heretics might be the more bold, and the catholics more inclynable to
the worse part, and y^ more faynte and feeble in the faith.

But I know this very well that heretyques have made that noise, both for the
cause before said, and ^lso to fere the ordynaryes therewith, and to put their
officers in dread from doing of their office. And peradventure upon such noise
some officers have been aferd. And at the least wise I wo^e well, some
heretyques have been so bold, that they have not fered to flock to gether /
not all ar the first for heresy, but some fall in among t^em ^or good
company, to (...) some s^rewd turn they (...) greatly what / but (...) with a
little more acquay^taunce and communycacyon, have fallen into their heresies
also. And such noyses be some time for the advantage and fortherans of them
that entende unhappiness, to make folk wene they were very many, be they never
so few.

I remember many times that even here in London, after the great besynes that
was there on a May day in the morning, by a rysyng made against strangers /
for which diverse of the pre^tyces and journey men suffered execucyo^ of
treason, by an old statute made long before, against al such as would violat
the kings saufconducte: I was appointed among other to search out and inquire
by dylygent examynacyon, in what wise and by what persons, that pryuy
confederacy began. And in good faith after great time taken, and myche
dilygence used therein / we perfytly tried out at last, that all that bysynes
of any rysynge to be made for the matter, byganne only by the conspyracy of two
young laddes that were prentyces in chepe. which after y^ thing dyuysed first
and compaced between them twain, perused pryuyly the iourneymen first, and
after the prentyces* of many of the mean crafts in the city / beryng the
first that they spoke with in hand, that they had secretly spoken with many
other occupacyons all ready, and that the^ were all agreed thereunto* and that
bysydes them there were two or three hundred of seruyng men of diverse lords
houses, and some of the kings to, which would not be named nor known, that
would yet in the night ^e at hand / and when they were ones up, would not
fayll to f^ll in with them and take their part.

Now this ungracious inuencyon and these words of those two lewd laddes
(which yet in the business fled away them self, and never came again
after) did put some other by their oversight and lightness in such a courage
and boldenes, that they wend them self able to avenge their ^yspleasure in the
night / and after either never to be known, or to be strong enough to bear yt
out and go farther.

And the like ungracious ^olycy dyuise now these here^yques that call them
self eua^gelycall brethren / some pot-heded postles they have, tha^ wander
about the realm into sundry shyres, of whom every one has in every ^hyre a
diverse name / and some peradventure in corners here and there they bring into
the brether^ed. But whyther they get any or none, they let not to lie when
they come home, and say that more then half of every shyre is of their own
sect. And the same boste Bayfelde thapo^^ata which was after burne^ in
Smythfelde, made unto mine own self. But blessed be god wha^ he came to the
fire, he fownd none very ready to pull him fro it.

How be it there was in one place of the dyocyse of London but la^e, a company
that by such means each encoraging other, took such heart and boldenes, and
openly by day they ensembled them self together to the number of an hundred or
above, to rescue a well known open hertyke out of the ordynaryes hands. How
be it as many as they were they spedde not, and some of them punysshed after.

And in y^ same dyocise also, when there was a priest taken for heresye, and in
the co^myssaryes hands / word was brought him that except he delivered the
priest and let him go, he should within two hours have.ii. or.iii. hundred
come fet him, that would pluck down his house or burn it over his head. wheruppon
the commissary wers afraid then hurt, delivered out the priest / whom if he
had kept still, there would peradventure for all y^ crakes, not one heretyke
of them all have been so bold to come fette him.

But yet that could I not well have warraunted him.

And in some place of the same dyocise also, they have made a great face, and
said that though the king sent his commyssyon under his great seal therefore
/ they would not suffer a sore suspected priest of theyrs for heresye to be
taken thense. How be (...) when that after I s^aled a co^missyon and sent it
upon the assaye, it made their hearts (god be thanked) faynted and were so
well come down, that they laid all the wyghe to a few lewd fellows and
women in the town.

And therefore boste and brag these blessed br^therne never so fast, they feel
full well them self, that they be to feeble in what country so ever they be
strengest. For if they thought them self able to mete and match the
catholykes / they would not I wene lie still i^ rest three days.

For in all places where heresies have spronge^ hitherto so has it ever proved
yet.

And surely so neglygently might it be handeled, and the matter so long
forslowthed, y^ at length in time so might it hap here to. And verily that
they look onys therefore (as far as they be yet fro the power) some of them
have not let to say, nor some to write it neither. For I read the letter my
self which was cast into the palyce of y^ right re^erende father in god
Cuth^^rt now bishop of Durhm^, and at that ^^me bishop of London / in which
among many other bragyng words mete what so ever they were for those heretyke
brethren that made it, were these words contained.

There will onys come a day.

And out of questyon that day they not only long for* but also daily look for
/ and would if they were not to weke not fail to find it / and in some morning
erly like good thryuynge husbands, arise by them self uncalled, as they
suddenly did in Basyll.

And the greter hope have they, because in places where they fall in company,
men use them not now adays as the time was when they did.

For they se^ that it begins almost to grow in custume, that among good
catholyke folk, yet be they suffered boldly to talk vnchekked.

which thing all be it far from commendable, yet with many folk it happeth
upon a good surety, that good men in their own mind co^ceyue of the strength
and fastnes of the catholyke faith / which they verily think so strong, that
heretykes for all their babbling shall never be able to vaynquyshe. And therein
undoubtedly their mind is not only good but also very true. But they think
not far enough. For as the se^ shall never surunde and over whelme all the
land, and yet has it eaten many places in* and swalowed hole cuntrees up,
and made many places now see that sometime were well inhabyted lands, and has
lost part of his own possessyon in other parts again: so though the faith
of Christ shall never be ouerflowe^ with heresies, nor the gates of hell
prevail against Crystes church / yet as in some places it wynneth in new
people, so may there in some places by negligence be lost tholde.

For if that we because we know our cause so good, bear our self theruppon so
bold, that we make light and sleyght of our adversaries: it may happen to
fare between the catholykes and heretykes at length, as it fares sometime in a
suyte at the law by some good man, against whom a su^tle wily shrew begins
a false accyon, and asks from him all the land he has.

This good man sometime that knows his matter so true, persuadeth to him self
that it were not possible for him to lose it by the law. And when his counsel
talks with him, and asks him how he can prove this point or y^, for him
self / answers again, fear ye not for that sir, I warraunt you / all the
whole country knows it / the matter is so true, and my part so plain, y^ I
care not what judges, what arbytrours, what.xii. men go thereon. I will challenge
no man for any labor that mine adversary can make therein. And with such good
hope / the good man goes him home, and there sytteth still and puts no
doubt in the matter. But in the mean while his adversary (which for lack of
treuth of his cause, must needs put all his trust in craft) goes abouth his
matter busely, and by all y^ false means he may makes him friends, some with
good felowshyppe, some with rewards, fyndeth a fellow to forge him false
euydence, makes means to the shyryffe, geteth a parcyall panell, laboreth the
jury / and when they come to the bar he has all his trynkettes ready / where
as good Tomme Treuth comes forth upon the the other side, and because he weneth
all y^ world knows how true his matter is, brings never a witness with
him, and all his euydence vnsorted. And one wist I ones, that brought unto the
bar when the ^ury was sworn, and openly delivered his counsel his tender
box with his flynte and his matches, instead of his bo^ of euyde^ce, for that
had he left at home / so neglygent are good folk sometime, when the known
^routh of their matter makes them over bold.

And surely myche what after this fashyon in many places play these here^ykes
and we. For like as a few birds always chyrkynge and fleyng from bushe to
bushe, many times seem a great many: so these heretyques be so besyly walking,
that in every ale house, in every tavern, in eu^ry barge, and almost every
bote, as few as they be a man shall always find some / and there be they so
besye wyt^ their talking, and in better places also where they may be herd,
so fervent and importune in putting forth of any thing which may serve for
the fortheraunce of their purpose, that between their importune preasyng, and
the dylygence or rather the negligence of good catholyke men, appears often
times as great a dyfference, as between frost and fire.

And surely between the tre^ catholyke folk and the false heretykes, yt fares
also much like as yt fared between false Judas and Crystes faithful apostles.
For while they for all Crystes calling upon them to wake and pray, fell
first in a slumber, and after in a deed sleep: the traitor neither slept nor
slumbered / but went about full besely to betray his master, and bring him
self to myschyefe.

But yet when he came with his company, they escaped not all scot fre / nor
Peter well a waked out of his sleep was not so slothful, but that he could
cut of one knaves ea^e / nor all the wreches of them with all their wepens,
able to stand against Crystes bare word, when he said, I am (...) whom ye
seek / but to ground they fell forthwith up right upon their backs. whereby we
be sure that neither heretics nor deuyls can any thing do but by gods
special sufferau^ce / and that they shall between them both, never be able to
destroy the catholyke faith, nor to prevail against y^ catholyke church / and
all the myschyef shall be their own at length, though god for our sin
suffer them for a scourge to prevail in some places here and there for a while
/ whom upon me^nes amendment he will not fail to serve at the last, as does
y^ tender mother which when she has beten her child for his wanto^nes,
wypeth his ^y^n and kysseth him, and casts the rod in the fire.

How be it if ever it should (as god forbede it should, and I trust it never
shall) ^y such ^old sloth and negligence on the catholyke part, and such hot
fervent labor of the heretykes, y^ the heretykes part should hap to grow so
strong, as they should co^spyre to give the adventure by fete of hands: I
nothing dout of good me^nes good hertes, nor of the present aid and help of
god, but that the presence of parell raysyng men out of this dulle sleep, would
cause them than so to wax warm and dylygent in y^ matter, that the heretykes
should have such speed, as they have before this time had in this realm when
they have attempted the like.

But yet though the heretykes part should (as I verily trust they should) have
ever more the worst / yet very sure it is, y^ neither part should have y^
better / but y^ it would then well appear, that it had been much more wisdom
for all good catholyque men, to have waren warmer before, and to have repressed
those heretykes in time, before they grew to so many.

And this thing was perceived very well both before the making of that statute
of king Henry the iiii, which statute this pacyfyer would have now reformed,
and also at the time of the making / and yet much better sone after in y^
reygn of the prince of famous memory king Henry y^.v. For before this statute
made / the parleame^t i^ the fyfth year of king Richard the *ii. complained of
heretics / and found great harm grow that they were not arrested, but
without arreste in contempt of the censuris of holy chirch, spread their
heresies about fro shyre to shyre and fro dyocise to dyocise. whereof the realm
fered as y^ statute expresses, that thereof would at length grow some great
co^mocyo^ and perell. And therefore it was than provided, that at the request of
thordinary y^ chau^cellour should fro time to time award out commyssyons, to
attache such heretykes and keep them in strong prison, till they were iustyfyed
and ordered according to the laws of the church. And yet was it afterward
well perceived, that this prouisyon could not suffyce. For the heretykes would
comenly be gone before the co^missyo^ could come, and do as much hurt in an
other place. And therefore the parleame^t in the second year of king Henry
the.iiii, both being informed by the clergy, and also by them self perceiving
that those here^^kes encreaced still, and would at length do some great
myschiefe but y^ they were better repressed / did among other good things
provide, that thordynaryes might arrest the heretykes, and imprysone them them
self. And yet was all that to little to. For in some places y^ heretykes waxed
to strong, and would not be arrested for them. And therefore at last it came to
that point, that men long had looked for. For those heresies bygonne by
wycleffe in the time of the noble prince king Rychard the.ii, and being then
by some folk mayntened, and by many men wynked at, and almost by all folk for
slouthed / the parell was so long neglected, that y^ heretykes were grown
unto such number, courage, and boldenes, that afterward in the time of y^ said
famous prince king Henry the fyfth, they co^spyred among them, not only the
abolycyo^ of the faith, and spoylyng of the spyrytualtye, but also the
destruccyon of the king and all his nobylyte, with a plain subuersyon and
ouerturnyng of y^ state of his hole realm. Upon which their false conspyracy
dysclosed / when they were by the policy of y^ noble prince and his counsel
dysappoynted, and secretly prevented, and the field taken up before, i^ which
they had ente^ded to gather to gether by night, and from thens to have made
their ^nuasyon: than after dew punysheme^t done upon many of the^, it was well
perceived what great need it was ever after to repress and subdue such
sedycyouse heresies forthwith at y^ first springyng. And therefore was there by
and by thereupon by the full perlyament, not only that law confermed which
law this pacyfyer here speaks of in this chapyter* but also mo made thereunto
/ as y^ they that were delivered to y^ secular hands, should forfayt both
goods and lands / and that the great officers of the realm should be
solempnely sworen to repress heretykes and assyst y^ ordynaryes. And therefore
undoubtedly y^ good christen zele of the prince, the nobles, and the commons,
toward the mayntenau^ce of the faith / and their high wisdom in prouydynge
for the conseruacyon of the peace, rest, and suerty of the realm, were the
authors and very doers, in y^ making and passing of that very virtuous and
very prudent act. which act, that ever this pacyfyer, or a great many such,
shall be able to ^nduce this prudent parlyament to change, that will I se ere
I believe. which I trust I never shall in this time / namely in which, though
there be not the.xv. part of so many heretykes as these y^ be would very feign
there were, and while there be not, yet would have the^ seem to be, yet are
there of troth many mo then there were within these few years past / and
thereby the cause for which the statute was made, not only stands still, but
is over y^ of late very gretely increased / and so more need to let those
laws stand and make mo such to the^ beside, then by the asswagyng and
mytygacyon of any part of the^, to bring these heretykes into such courage and
surety, as the goodly dyuyses of this pacyfyer could not fail if they were
followed to bring them.

The.xlviii. chapyter.
WHich, where as he uses to y^ setting forth of his purpose, a surmised
suspicyo^ against the spyrytualty, making men believe under his figure of Some
say, that the spyrytuall judges mysse handle those matters, and use them self
therein cruelly: I dare be bound to warraunt, that right good witness and
worshypfull shall record and testyfye, that they have been present and seen the
judges handle them with very great favor always, and sometime to say the troth
to tenderly.

whereof for the mean while me think I may take to record for all his Some
says this pacyfyer him self and his own words, which in this pyteouse
book of dyuysyon him self says. For in his first chapyter he says (as I
showed you) that some men to pull richesse from the church, have not only
spoken and by plain words affermed heresye, but have also despised
pylgrymages and purgatory, and plain inueyed against them of polycy.

Now sees every man that any eyes has, that if the ordynaryes and the
spyrytuall judges were so fyerse and so cruel as this pacyfyer speaks of,
then would not those other men think that openly to speak and afferme false
heresies, were for any manner purpose any proper polycy. And therefore as for
such crueltye and mysse handelynge of innocents / that this pacyfyers ^ale is
untrue, both other good folk can testyfye, and his own words also bear
witness.

And therefore need we no such change of the laws for that purpose. But on
the the other side, what harm would come of his mytygacyons, and what increace of
heretykes, the hole sum and sequel of his deuyses do more than many festely
show.

For suppose me now, that a tynker or a tylar which could (as some there can)
read english, and being instructed and taught by some old cunnyng weuar in
wyclyffes wyckette, and Tindals books, and Frythes, and friar Barons were now
become him self an vsshar, or after his masters deceace a doctor / and that
were such a one as Fryth writes resorted to him, wh^che though he was but
Frythes dyscyple and scolar, was yet (he says) more meately to be bishop
than many that wear the myter: now if this tynker or tylar lurking about and
teaching his gospel in corners, were secretly detected to his ordynary, and
thereupon sent for and came / he should by the deuyse of this pacyfye^ for the
first shyfte say bring me forth mine accuser / and tha^ sith the calling ex
officio were gone, home goes the tynkar again merely for that time, and
takes forth his scolars a new lesson.

Then if the court will appoint an offycer of their own for an accuser, as an
officer of a temporal court may give informacyon for the king: the tynkar
yet when he were called again, would cry out upon that. And who so holds
against the process ex officio, would take the tynkars part therein to, and
call those twain but both one / and so home goth the tynkar again.

Then if some man (which would be long erste I wene) could yet at the last be
founden, that would offer him self as an accuser against this tinkar, when he
were called agay^^, and his heresies were laid unto his charge: yet if the
witnesses were peraduen ture some scolars of his own / and lackyng the wyly
shyftes that him self had, first had denied their heresies upon their oaths,
and after yet confessed them again both upon them self and their master
tynkar to, then were there never so many of them, yet by the deuyse of this
pacyfyer, al their wytnes were naught worth, because they were naughty men,
here^ikes them self, and first forsworen also / ^o that yet home goth the
tynkar again.

Now if there were after other good honest proves, that would come in and
prove plainly the heresies that he held / when the tynkar were thereto called,
he would say he (...) yt all of ignorance.

Then if the matter were such, as he must needs have herd of and known the
true faith before, as pilgrimage, purgatory, or the sacrament of the autre: he
will not yet stycke myche to say, bring in some body here that will swear
that ever he did teach yt me. And yet when that answer in such an open matter
will not serve / he will say that he said yt of symplycyte, and that he
byleueth as the church byleueth he. And when he is asked how the church
byleueth, he will say he woteth nere. And if his words be rehearsed unto him
clean contrary to the comen known catholic faith of the church / he will say
he was not ware that the church byleued so / and will say that they should not
speak of such high matters y^ serve for doctors, to such a pore tynkar y^
medleth with brass and not with latin. And there shall he then have some of
his other faculty gather and stand about, and say yt is pytye in deed that
such a pore simple soul should have any such questyons asked him. But they
will put yt for no pyty^ at all, that such an unlearned fool shall among such
other as are less learned then him self, teach boldly the false part, and
there brage and boste that he better understands y^ matter, then all the
doctors in the town.

yet if it appear that by sore words he despised and inueyed against
pylgrymages and purgatory, and such other things so that he did it not of
sym. plycyte when he spoke therein so shrewdly / then has this pacyfyer taught
him to say, that he did it of polycy to pull away riches from the church /
and therefore can that be no heresye.

Now if the judges be so sore and so cruel, that they will not allow that
polyccy / yet has this pacyfyer taught him farther to say, that he did but
speak it affyrmatyuely, and will not hold it opinatyucly / and than ye wot
well it is by this pacyfyer no heresye.

And therefore must his judges when they have all done, send this tynkar yet
onys home again / and not keep him to long a way, lest his scolars should
play the truantes and lack their learning the while.

And yet if he said as myche after again, and theruppon were called again / he
might say agarne that he were ouer^sene in y^ saying, of a ^yghtne^^e of wit
and slyppernes of tongue. But he will not hold it opynatyuely / and therefore
yet again it may be no heresye / so that home must the tynkar again.

And now y^ it should happen him to say and do so far as he were afraid to
bide any farther rek^ning, namely where spyritual men so f^erce and so cruel
should be his judges / the bishop might not arest him yet, till proves be
brought in first, that the spyrytualtye have left their great desire to
abjure and punysshe heretykes / but must all the mean while cite him suspende
him, and accurse him, and fet him in by the kings wryt when he is run ou^e
far of into an other cu^t^ey, and there ha^h changed his name and set up a
new scole, where as men can neither find him nor yet wot where to seek him.

when should there by these means wylfull offenders be punysshed? which
though this pacyfyer pretend that he would have done / yet consider these th^e
chapyters of his which I have rehearsed you, the first, the seventh, and the
eyghte, and ye shall find his deuyses come to little better effect, than
after this fasshyon that I have here descrybed you.

And than if such good prouysyons may be made for them, that they may never
be brought into answer, and that they may have so many shyftes when so ever
they come: it will little fere them what pain ye set after con^uyc^yon /
burn them twyse if ye will after judgment, they will with good will agree /
prouydynge first such good acts for them as they shall never come so far.

And therefore good chryste^ readers, would god the world were such as every man
were so good, spyrytuall, te^porall, and all, that neither part could find
any fawte in other / and all these heresies so clean gone and forgeten, and al
those that are infected were so clean turned and changed, that no man neded
either abiuracyon or punysshement.

But sith that this is more easy to wyshe, than lykely to look for: therefore is
it wisdom that spyrytuall and temporal both, albe it men be not all saints,
yet if their condycyo^s be tolerable, either part labor to make him self
better, and charitably somewhat either part bear with other. And those extreme
vices which neither the tone nor the the other ought in any wise to suffer, as
theft, adultery, sacrylege, murder, inceste, and perjury, sedycyon,
insurreccyon, treason, and heresye / both parts in one agreyng, to the honor
of god and peace of Christ's church, with rest, wealth, and surety of y^
prince and the realm, dylygently refourme and amend in such as are mendable
/ and those whose corrupt canker no cure can heal, cut of in season for
corruptynge farther.

ANd thus good christian readers I make an end of this matter, the book I mean
of this dyuysyon / wherein I have nothing touched nor ente^ded, but only y^ I
would not the te^poralty bare the spiritualty y^ worse mind or affeccyo^, for
any such subtle inue^ced ways that lay the fau^es of the badde to the whole
body, wherein be many good / and under a figure of some say, say some things
false them self / nor that men should causeless upon such surmysed and
unproven crueltye, change the good lawis before made against heretyques,
whereby to the dyspleasure of god and provoking of his indygnacyon, we were
lykely to have the faith decay, and more harm grow thereon then any man yet can
tell.

The whole so^me and effect therefore of my mind in this matter is, that as
touching the spyrytualtye, I bear a tender mind of troth toward (I say) y^
body not toward those that are naught therein. And this mind is every man
bound to bear / and I trust so does this pacyfyer to, and will of him self I
wene do well enough, if he use to the contrary none evil counsel.

As touching here^ykes, I hate that vice of theyrs and not their persons /
and very feign would I that the tone were destroyed, and the the other saved. And
that I have toward no man any other mind then this, (how lowdely so ever
these blessed new brethren the prof^ssours and preach^rs of verycye bylye me)
if all the favor and pytye that I have used among them to their amendment
were known, y^ wo^de I warrau^t you well and p^ayne appear / whereof if it were
requysyte I could bring forth witnesses mo then men would wene.

And sure this one thing will I be bold to say, that I never found any yet,
but had he ben never so bad, nor done never so myche harm before: yet after
that I found him ones changed and in good mind to mende, I have been so
glad thereof, that I have used him fro thens forth not as an evil man or an
abject, nor as a stranger neither, but as a good man and my very friend.

How be yt because yt were neither right nor honestye, that any man should
look for more thank then he deserves / I will that all the world wit it on y^
tothersyde, that who so be so depely grounded in malice to the harm of his
own soul and other men's to, and so set upon the sowynge of sediciouse
heresies, that no good means that men may use unto him, can pull that
malycyouse folly out of his poysened proud ob^tynate heart: I would rather be
content that he were gone i^ time, then over long to tarry to the destruc^yon
of other.

Finally as for the author of y^ book of dyuisyo^, because he professes these
herety^ues opynio^s for heresies as they be / I trust in all his other things
him self means but well / but partly may be by some pytyfull affection
led. And some things he says but upon report / and somethynges affermeth
peradventure as of him self, because of y^ fyrme c^edence that he therein has
given to some that were not so credyble as he took them fore. But in
conclusyon what so ever he be, for a^y thing that I perceive in his book, he
shall I trust in conclusyon be founden no such manner of man, as folk should of
reason reken to bear unto the weal of the prince and the realm, any better
mind the^ I. How be yt if his wit and his learning find a better way, then
not only I (which am but a plain soul and can invent no neweltyes, but am
content to stand to the old order and laws) but also then all they, which
for this realm in special, and for the whole church of Christ in general,
have made those prouysyons of old: I neither can nor will forbede any man to
follow him.

But this will I be bold to counsel every man, to whose part so ever any
such change shall perteyne, first that they have as I dout not but they
will, a good christen mind to the mayntenaunce of Crystes catholyke faith /
and that they therein stand by the old, without the contrary change of any
point of our old bylyefe, for any thing brought up for new, not only by
Luther, Tyndale, Fryth, or friar Barons / but also if there would (as there
never will) an angel (as saint Poule says) come out of henyn and preche a
contrary new.

Secundely for as myche as these new fathers of these new brethren, like as
they make falsed treuth and treuth falsed, and faith heresies and heresies
faith, so do call also the new old and the old new / not lettynge to call
in their books that faith but new, which them self confess in the same
books to be more old than thage of eight hundred year: I will advise you
therefore good readers for the true taking of the old faith, and for the
dyscernyng thereof from all new, to stand to the common well known bylyefe of
the common known catholyke church of all christen people / such faith as by
your self, and your fathers, and your grau^defathers, you have known to be
byleued / and have over that herd by them that the contrary was in the times
of their fathers and their graundefathers also, taken ever more for heresye.
And also ye y^ read but even in english books, shall in many things
perceive the same, by stories five times as far before that.

we must also for the perceiving of the old faith from new, stand to the
wrytynges of old holy doctors and saints / by whose exposicyo^s we se what
points are expressed in the scripture, and what points the catholyke church
of Christ has bysyde the scripture received and kept by the spyryte of god and
tradycyon of his apostles.

And specially must we also stand in this matter of faith, to the
determynacio^s of Crystes catholyke church.

Now if any man will bear other in hand, that this point or that point is not
determined, or that the holy doctors of y^ church write not in such wise but
the contrary / than who so ever is not of such learning, as to perceive by him
self whither of those two say true that hold therein contrary partys: than
except the article be a plain open known thing of it self, not dowted of
before, let him not be light of credence in the byleuynge either the tone
dysputer or the the other, though they would both preche high praises of their
own conning, and say that bysyde all their much worldely business they
had spent many years about the study of scripture, and bost that their books
of dyuynyte were worth never so myche money, or that by the spyryte they were
inspired and with the celestyall dew suddenly sprongen up dyuynys, as lustye
fresh and grene as after any shower of rain ever spronge any bed of lekes.
Let no man I say be light in byleuynge them for all that / but let him by my
pore co^sayle pray god inspyre him self, to believe and follow the thing that
^^aye be his high pleasure / and let him thereupon appoint with him self to
live well / and forth with to begin well, get him self a good goostely
father, and shryue him of his sins / and than concerning the question, ask
aduyce and counsel of those whom him self thinks between god and his new
cleansed conscience, for lernyng and virtue most lykely, without any parcyall
lenynge, indyffere^tly to tell him treuth.

And thus far I say for the faith it self, because I here some men myche
speak and boste that they will labor for declaracyons of heresye, which as me
seems is a thing that little needs. For I never wyste any man in my life
put in trouble for any point of heresye, but such points as were for
heresye well and openly known among the common people. And saint Poule says y^
heresies be manifest and open / so that he thought as it seems, that there
neded none other declaracyon than the common received faith of the chryste^
pepl^ to the contrary.

But now as touching any new order concerning heresies, with the change of
laws before dyuysed for the repressyo^ of them: I have n^ more to say therein,
but aduys^ every good man endeuour^ him self to keep well y^ laws all ready
made of old / except he se the cause of the making changed, or some other
great necessyte / and that he se that point by more ordinary means proved,
than either by some say, or they say, or many say / or else that he perceive
well at y^ lest, that those folk which would labor to change them be better
and wyser both, than ever were those y^ made them. And thus fynysshe I this
matter concerning heresies / besechynge our lord and savior for his bitter
passion, that as his holy sacraments thereof took their strength, so by the
prayour of all those holy saints y^ have both by their holy doctrine and
ensample of living, some of them planted y^ faith, and some of them in sundry
times well watered the plants, so him self will of his goodness specially now
vouchsaufe as the warm son (the ^ery eternal only begotten son of his
eternal father) to ^prede his beams upon us, and aspyre his breath into us,
and i^ our hearts as saint Poule says give his faith strength and encreace.

The.l. chapyter.
NOw come I to the last ^^wt that the brethern find in my books. For as for
one more that was showed me wyth^n this seven night, I not so myche esteem, as
to vouchesau^e to answer, that is to wit where they reprove that I bring in
among the most ernest matters, fansyes and sportes, and merry tales. For as
Horace says, a man may sometime say full soth in game. And one that is but a
lay man as I am, it may better happily become him meryly to tell his mind,
tha^ seryously and solempnely to preach. And over this I can scant believe that
the brethern find any mirth i^ my books. For I have not myche herd y^ they
very merely read them.

But as to the last fault that they find, which I was about now to speak of,
where as they say that as concerning the church, I have not fulfilled my
promise / I shall here first put you in remembrance what my promise was.

In the end of my preface before Tyndals confutacyon these are my very words.

Now shall I (god willing) at my next ^eyso^ go farther in his book / and
come to the very breast of all this battle / that is to wit the question
which is the church. For that is the point that all these heretyk^ by all the
means they may labor to make so dark / that by their wills no man should
wit what they mean^. But I trust to draw the serpent out of his dark d^nne /
and as the poets ^a^n that ^ercules drew up C^^^erus the mastrffe of hell in
to the light where his eyes dased: so shall as I wi^h y^ grace of that light
which illumyneth every man that comes into this wor^de / make you that ma^er
so light some and so clear to every man / y^ I shall leave Tyndale never a dark
corner to (...) into / able to hyde his hedde.

Then after that I laue so clearly confu^ed Tynda^e concerning that point / and
shall have plainly proved you the sure and stedfas^e authoryte of Cristes
catholic known ch^rche / against all Tyndales tryflyng sophys^ycacyons /
which he would should seem so solemn subtle ins^^ub^es / which ye shall se
prou^d very ^rantyke folyes: after this done I say / before I go farther with
Tyndale / I purpose to answer good yon^e father Fryth.

Now god readers who so list to say that I have not fulfilled this promise /
if he read not my book, I can not make him se the thing that he list not to
look on.

If he have red it, and think him self not satisfied / I can not make him
perceive more then his wit will serve him.

If he understand it well, and yet will say my promise is not fulfilled / I
can not let him for his pleasure to lie. But let him what so ever he be put
in writing what moves him so to say, and I shall than I dowte not make other
folk perceive, that all my promise in that point I have fully pertormed and
more / that is to wy^^ by as myche more at the ^este, as all mine eight book
amounts. For like as in the the other I have fully confuted Tyndals church: so
have I in that book confuted as for this world, the church that friar Barns
had falsely framed here also / whereof I promised nothing. So that as towchynge
the certentye of the church, and of y^ infallible doctryn thereof / who so read
and advise well this work of mine made for the confutacyon of Tyndale / and
therwyth read and consider y^.vii. first chapyters and the last of my second
book of my dyaloge, wheruppon Tindale made all his wurke: I dowt not but he
that thus will do, shall find him self fully satysfyed.

And therefore good christian readers, as for such farther things as I have in
my said preface promised / I purpose to pursew at some other farther leysour.
But first I think yt better to bes^owe some time upon an another thing / and
leuynge for a while both defense of mine own fautes and finding of other
mennys in writing, think better to bestow some time about the mendynge of
mine own in living, which is a thing now for many men more necessary then is
writing. For of new book makers there are now mo then enough.

wherefore that all such as will write, may have y^ grace to write well / or at
the least wise none other purpose then to mean well / and as well writers as
other to amend our own fautes and live well: I beseech almyghtye god to
grant us / and that all folk spyrytuall and temporal in this world living,
and all good cryste^ souls departed hence and yet not out of pain, may for
grace every part pray for other / and all y^ blessed holy saints in heaven,
both here for grace and there for glory, pray to god for us all. Amen.

I have consyde^ed good rea^ers of late, a place in a book of Tindale, whe^^ he
somewhat (...) and gooth bakke, and modefyeth part of his old posycyons
agayns^ satysfaccyon. For he agrees in that p^ace, that because when a man
has sinned, he is as after a sykenesse the wea^er / therefore he mus^e tame the
body the more, and do the more good to make him again the ^^enger. Which
words of Tyndale if I had marked, I would have touched in the said place. And
sith I have seen them sins / I give you knowledge thereof, because I would not
willyngly in any thing mysse rehe^se him.

How be yt though he by those words somewhat more mytygate the matter, then he
was wont to do before: yet as for any sacramental penance to be taken of the
priest, or any penance to be done, in reuengynge upon him self the
^yspleasure that he has done to god, or alms, or other good work for
helping to weshe (...) any sin passed, or to mynys^e any part^ of the pain
dew thereunto, or for the aswagyng of the wrath of god: all this gere for all
hy^ moderacyon is great sin with him still. And therefore as touching the
sacrament of penance, his moderacyon nothing mendeth his heresy.
