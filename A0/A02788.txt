The epistle exhortatorye of an English Christyane unto his derelye beloved
co^treye of England / against the pompouse popyshe Bysshoppes thereof / as yet
the true members of their filthy father the great Antichrist of Rome / Henrye
Stalbrydge.

As I have compyled this treatise in the zele of God and my prince against the
tyrau^t of Rome and his secret maynteners. So is yt my desire that his grace
may have yt as a fruit of my Christen obedience. And I doubt yt not / but some
godly manne loving his grace better then that wicked Pope / will faythfullye
deliver it unto him / the slayghtes of their false generation considered. Pray
(gentle reader) that yt may find grace in his sight.

Deal with Babylon as she has deserved / for she has set up herself against
the Lord / and against the holy one of Israel. ^ere. (...).

The epistle exhortatorye of an English Christian unto his derelye beloved
contreye of England against the pompouse popyshe Bysshoppes thereof / as yet
the true members of their filthy father the great Antichrist of Rome.
IN my heart I wyshe daily / and for the same do I ernestlye pray unto our
most mer cyfull father the euerlyuynge God / and that for his sons sake our
only redemer / and full sauer Jesus Christ / if his heavenly will so be /
that he ones open throughlye the eyes of our most worthy and noble king (as
he has alredye begone) and of all his other counselors / lords / and
burgeses of his parliament / which are chosen out of the whole realm to
confound ungodly customs and to set up in there towmes sawes that are more
godly / to suppress wickedness and to maynteyne Christen virtues / to
prefer the commen welthe before all singular or private welthes / yea /
utterly to destroy and abolyshe for ever soche filthy tradicions as have no
just ground upon Gods holy word / as are all the vsages / rytes / laws /
decrees / services / supersticions / and sorceries of the Romish Antichrist /
and to s^ in open practice the true worshyppinges auaunced to Christ's glory /
so edifyeng his people by the scripturs in the knowledge of one only eternal
lyuinge God. And in so doing they should mainteyne the co^m^n welthe both of
soul and body.

I say yet ones again / and that in theze se of ye Lord as he is my judge /
I wyshe ^f his graciouse pleasur so were / that first the kings majesty and so
forth all the rest (unto whom God has given power and auctorite upon earth
under him may throughlye se and perseyue how that not only the bloody
bearwolfe of Rome / but also the most part of ye other Bysshoppes and stout
sturdye canons of ca thedrass churches with other petie prowlers and
prestigiouse Prestes of Baal his malignaunt members in all realms of
Christendom / specially here in England / does yet tore abroad like hongrie
lions / frete inwardlye like angry bears / and byte as they dare like cruel
wolves / ^ringe together in corners (...) a swarm of add^rs in a donge hyss /
(...) wylye subtle serpents / to vphold^ and pr^ their fylthy father of Rome
the head of their bawdye broad if it may be.

This ones perseyued and seaue by a godly circumspeccyon / I wysh ^n the same
vehemency of sprete and prayer / the said noble king / counselors / and
burgeses to procure a full reformacyon concerning there aduowterouse doctrine
/ there prodigiouse pomp / there insaciable cloyninge / and tyrannycall
persecutinge of Christ in his faithful members. No doubt of yt / but the
mercy of our eternal father has opened unto us in these latter days what
there forked fatherhede / there oyled auctorite / and there shaven holiness is /
for all there craftye compases of wordlye wisdom that they should not apere ye
same generacyon of vipers that Johan Baptist and Christ has warned us of. His
word has he now appointed by diverse of his ministers to be their utter
destruccyon / for blasphemouslye deludinge his redeemed heritage so many
hundred years in there counterfete kyngedome of hypocresie / wherein they show
now what they have been / even very heretics to God / trayters to their
princes / and thieves to their Christen commons.

No less do I judge it then a bound duty of ye said faithful ministers /
to manifest their mischeues to ye universal world / every manne according
to his talent given of God / some with pen / and some with tongue / so
bringinge them out of their old estimacyon / least they should still regne in
the peoples consciences to their souls destruccyon. An evident example have
they of Christ thus to do / which openly rebuked their filthy forefathers the
scribes / lawers / pha rise^s / doctors / pr^s / bisshops / and hypocrites for
making Gods commandments of non effect to support their own tradicions /
so clerlye condempninge their hypocrita^ life and doctrine. Mat thew. xv. xvi.
and. xxiii. xxiiii Beware (says he) of the corrupt leven of the pharis^s /
Mark. viii. Luke. xii. Pause admonishes us also / that soche rauenynge wolves
should enter in among us after his departing as should not spare the floc ke /
Act. xx. ii. These. ii. i. Tim. iiii. So does John. i. John. ii so does Peter.
ii. Pe ii. so does Judas Thadeus in his epistle.

By these and many other places of the scriptures are we taught easily to know
at none days the wolf from the lamb and the hastye lion from the simple
sheep. As Christ sought by all means to deface the proud Pr^s / and to bring
poor Johan Baptist in reputacion of the people / for that he had uttered the
truth without flatterye. So would he now the true teachers of his Gospel to
be regarded be they never so poor / for his veryte^s sake / and the
blasphemers thereof to be had in an utter contempt. No less is it therefore than
a doctrine of his to be put in practyse among true Christianes / both in word
and writing to have the myscheues manifest of these spiritual mahoundes / the
very ofspringe of Cain / children of Caiphas / and successors of Simon Magus /
as their doctrine and lyuinge declares / nedynge no farther probation.
Notwithstanding through Gods grace I shall partlye open the wickedness both
of them and their fathers as the truth shall lead me. Most cruel enemies
have they been in all ages to ye verite of God ever sens the law was first
given and most ferce persecuters of Christ and his church.

Consydre first of all (besides that was done before in the law of nature) how
deuerslye Iannes and Iambres with other false prestes of Egypt persuaded Pharao
through lyenge signs and tokens to withstand the pleasure of God in Moses
and Aaron / Eyo. vii. and. ii. Tim. iii. Greuouslye was Micheas the true
prophet of the Lord vexed of Sedechias iii. Reg. xxii. and. ii. Para. xviii.
So was the good Prophet Hieremie of phassu^ and Semeias Hiere. xx. xxvi. and.
xxix Vvonderfullye were the Israelites abused by the idolatrouse prestes of
Baal / and the Chaldeanes by Belles prestes also in Babylon / till Helias and
Daniel in the word of the Lord detected their craftye cloyninges. iii. Reg.
xviii. and Daniel. xiiii. Great was the affliccion of ye Jews under king
Demetrius / through the cruel counsel of that trayterouse pressed Alchimus. i.
Machab. vii. Manifest is it by the. iiii. Gospels how the Bishops and Prestes
used Christ himself. Matthew. xxvi. Mark. xiiii. Luke. xxii. Johan. xviii. And
after what relygiouse sort they entreated his Apostles after his ascencyon /
Act. iiii. v. vi. and. vii.

Pause had to enemy Barieheu / Ananias / Hymeneus / Philetus / Hermogenes / and
Phyge^us / all maliciouse Prestes. Johan had Diotrephes / Carpocras Hebion /
Marcion / C^rinthus / and Cynopes / all bloodthursiye Prelates also / Peter had
Simon Magus and Menander / James the More had Abiathar the great Bishop.
Matthew had zaro^s and Arphaxat among the Moreanes / and the same likewise had
Simon and Thadeus as they preached among the Persianes / like as all the other
Apostles had in the quarters where they occupied No where could the verite be
taught / but those gloriouse glotto^s were ever at hand to resist it. After
the Apostels ty me was there no cruel tyrant unset a work by them to
persecute them which published that massage of light. Every where were they
whysperinge in that ^are and that ear / fearinge the fall of their kyngedome
if the Gospel were truly opened / as is evident to them which are expert in
the cronicles.

And thus have they co^tynued in their spyghtfull generacyon under the name of
a spiritualte / unto this present age / wherein their lowsye legerdemaine is
almost perseyued of all men / the light so abun dauntlye shyninge / yet are
they not ashamed / so whorishe is the face which they have cawte of their holy
mother. A great conscience made their natural forefathers to put the. xxx.
silver plates (that Judas ye trayter their elder brother had brought them) into
the treasurye / because yt was the price of blood / Math. xxvii. But no
conscience at all had those bloodye hypocrites to murder the eternal son ne of
God / in procuringe false witnesses against him / Matthew. xxvi. So like are our
spiritualte to these fore leaders of theyrs / as one adder is like an other or
the young wolf like the old as their daily fruits declares. They sought by
all means possible to quench the faith of his gloryouse resurreccyon /
wagynge the souldyers to say that his disciples had stolen him whyls they were
a sleep / Mat. xxviii. Which practice they occupye to this day by their hired
sophisters or university knights to blemishe his heavenly verite. Soche
shameless lyar^ are they against God and his word

But truly both they and their fathers has faughten in vain. ^ete soche
vessels of the wrath of God kycke / spewe / and spurn as much as they can /
yet will the truth of the Lord endure for ever. Seduce they never so
subtyllye / lie they never so lordelye / blaspheme they never so boldelye /
accuse they never so freshlye that the preachers are deceyuers and sediciouse
persons / procure they never so many cruel tyrauntes / yea / persecute they
and slay ^hey never so fercelye with Nero / Domicianus / Traianus / and soche
other / yet shall Christ always have a faithful co^gregacyon undefiled with
their wretched sorceryes. Maruele not ye Bysshoppes / Prelates / and Prestes /
though I thus in the zele of Helias and Phi^s stomach against your sturdye
storms of stubbernesse. For never was yet any tyranny ministered upon Christ
and his mystical members / but by your proud procurement. And now in our
days / where are any of the lords true servants burned or otherwise murthe
^ed for true preachinge / wrytinge / glosinge / or interpretynge the Gospel /
but it is by your cruel calling on.

How subtillye bewitched you the parliament house / when the. vi. blasphemouse
artycles collected out of the Popes wicked decrees were there enacted and
establyshed with more tyra^nie than ever under the Romish Pope / Mahomete or
any other tyrau^t before? Were not they first practiced of you to destroy all
them that should truly profess the Gospel (which are and will be always the
kings most faithful fryndes and to leave a plain path way that your Pope
might here after enter? At your trayterouse insurreccyon in the north it had
been wrong with this realm / had there not been a great nombre which had than
the fear of God written in their hearts / whereby they knew they could not rise
against their prince / but to their own dampnacyon / and that they were bound
also to defend him against all soche popysshe and rebellyouse trayters.

Thanks might well have been given in those days to our eternal God for
raysinge up (...) Tyndale the first true Apostle of Christ after Johan Vvy^ the
very manne of God and soche other like / which brought Christ's Gospel into
the knowledge of men / and wrote diverse grounded work^ upon the same. As the
Christen Obedience / the pa rabble of the wicked Mammon / the. iii. chapters of
Matthew / ye Sum of scripture / and diverse other / whereby the people were
than taught how to love God / and how to obey their princes and magistrates.
These heretic books (as you call them made the kings grace more faithful
fryndes in those days / than you Bysshoppes and Prestes were well co^te^ted
with. Well / I trust by this time they and soche other like have made him ten
times so many more. Not only were the said. vi. articles devised by the devil
and you for the utter destruction of Gods true servants and the kings
faithful subjects / but also to repare the broken walls of your yall Rome
again / as in deed they would do even to the very clouds if they were well
followed.

Think not that ^ne be so blind in this age / but they perseyue your craftye
cloyning. Full well knew wily Vvynche stre and other more of his fellawes the
first practisers of them / that were they ones received / granted / and
executed under pain of death / the Pope should never dye in England / what
though his name were suppressed with his pilgrimages / pardons / and a few
supersticyons besides. ^hmost wicked vermyne / wylly worms / subtyle and
craftye serpents / when will ye leave treading of Christ on the hele? Genesis
iii. When shall Gods son be unto you no sign of contradiccyon? Luke. ii.
When shall his verite be reueretlye used among you? I fear me / never / so
long as you remain in England. As our most godly sovereign began with
king Josias to reform his church / bannishynge your woluishe father as an
ungodly usurper for ever / ye patiently paused with lowerynge / lu^kynge /
and loutinge for fear of the sword and haltre.

But when ye ones perseyued that Gods holy laws were spredde / and your
unholy laws were set at naught / than thought ye it high time to work your
false feats. Than put ye apace in practyse your old serpentyne subtyste^s:
ye compassed them so with crafts which knew not your cursed conueyau^ces both
amongst the kings counsel and commons / that they were at the making of the
said six Popyshe artycles and are yet to this hour of this blind believe.
Though the Pope of Rome your old glo riouse grandes^re were the great
Antichrist of Europa by your own consent and grant / yet are his filthy
traditions holy / his beggerlye ceremonies godly / and his crooked Canon laws
laudable / convenient / and comelye / precyouse / fyt / and necessary to be
still admitted for the spiritual laws of the church of Englan de and for the
true worshyppynges of God therein / the scripturs of both testamentes rejected
or ess ponnished by most terrible death / where as they give not place unto
them.

Thus by soch^ subtyle slayghtes as ye bse / y^ mak^ God to give place to the
d^ / and his heavenly word to your false supersticious / as ded the first
serpent: yea / ye cause the kings majesty by aua^ynge soch^ h^ythnishe tyt^s
and sawes / to honor your Pope a fresshe / what though his name be abolysshed
with a few yearlye pos^ges besides. Ingenyo^se is your ^glynge as Melanchton
tells your tale / and as ^byllyam ^braghton declares in his hunting of the
Romish fox / like a faithful subject to his prince and no less natural
child and souynge brother to his contre. If you be not most wicked workers
against God and his verite / and most spyghtfull trayters to the king and his
realm / I can not think there be any lyuinge upon the earth. Be this only
spoken to you that maynt^e soche mysteries of madness.

If a tree may be judged by his fruits (as our sauer says it may) we must
needs judge you most pestilent Papists upon the manifest mayntenaunce of so
manyfolde myscheues with soche terrible terroure of halters and fire. So long
as the blasphemouse beggeryes of ye blodye Bisshoppes of Rome are not plucked
up by the roots / as were the vnsanerye sacrifices of Baal and of Bell / and so
broken in pieces with the brazen serpent idolatrouslye abused / the saw^s of
Gods true worshyppynge^ (which are in the Bible prescrybed) set up in their
stead / so long (I say) is (...) in (...) to ^an nishe the Pope out of
England / but he will sty^ dwell the in the secret consciences of men / do
the kings majesty and his counsel with his nobilite and commons what they
will or may to the contrary.

and yfas^ other craftye co^ueyaunces sail to the vpholdynge of him there /
yet shall their auryc^ar confession / a plant of his own setting in the
corrupt coun sell of laterane / do it workemanly enough No better way is there
to restore his nam^ again / nor no conuenienter mean to bring him to his
old es^macyon. No craftyar conueyaunce to bring the people in bondage of
blyndenesse / and in cruel captivity of co^ to the utter destruccyon of soul
an^ body. And that knew Gave gala^ (...) t^ ^opes holy (...) in Eng^ (...)
which now there in hie (...) most plenteousy^ ^eth his ^se vanit^s / with other
of his ^euterouse adherent^s more. Great is the diligence / labor / and stodye
of his whoryshe apostataes / holy Apostels I should say / as are both the old
and new tytled Bysshoppes / Suffraganes / archedea cons / officials /
chauncellars / deanes / c^ missaryes / doctors / curates / and parish prestes
with other gaudyshe gentilmen of that lyuerye and mark / to se these. vi.
artycles in every point observed.

In so much as having their mothers face / they have not shamed fercelye to
rebuke honest and godly men of sondrye questes at the geuynge up of their
verdy t^ / as they have not hunted after their minds and found out their game
to the cruel shedynge of poor innocents blood. To prove this true I will
bring forth one for example. Bonner the blodye Bishop of London Abashed
nothing at all extremelye to rebuke / manace and thretten a quest of honest
citeze^s and me^ne of good conscience in the yield hall at London in the year
of our lord a M. D. and. xli. for' quytynge of a poor innocent ladde called
Richard mekyns. Like a fer ce furyouse rauenynge wolf / insacyably desyerouse
of murder and cruellye gredye upon his pray / refusing the said quest /
chose out an other false quest to his purpose of soche as he and his filthy
generacyon had before perverted / and never ceased till he brought him to a
consuminge fire in Smithfelde / so making him a sacrifice to their great God
Mulciber.

And after this shameless sort no doubt of it / all the other Bysschoppes of
England / a very few excepted / have tyrannously handeled the kings true
subjects / and yet do to this day with less Christen equite and pity than
either Saracene or turk Jew or Pagane / to asuage their unquenchable thyrst:
It is not to be thought that they are very Gentle abroad or in the fardest
parts of the realm / when they use soche furyouse feats so nygh the kings
presence. So frantyke have they been of late days and so forgetful of
themselves in their mad modye mastry^s / that they have not feared to enter
the kings own house to hu^te their game / nor yet abashed at all sawcelye to
seek out their desyered pray in his own Preuye chamber / coveting so to have
murdered his most trustye fryndes and faithful servants. The same self
part in a manner would they have played with his noble grace that proud ^aman
the Amalechyte played with king Assu^s / malicyouslye seeking the destruccyon
of Mardocheus and other which above all men had sought his lives preseruacyon
^ester. iii. ^herin of right they have deserved upon a gyb^et to be hanged as
he was.

Never sent Christ soche bloodye Apostles nor two horned warryours / but the
deuyfe vicar Antichrist which is ye deadsye destroyer of faithful beleuers.
And now to you wc o^ishe (...) vynchestre agayne-the wyfye watterer of the
Popes old gardene. Although doctor London be dead doctor Pates run away /
and your own dear kynsmanne germane gardener hanged with other of your
preuycounsell. yet cease not you to play cruel Haman still. No / do your
old fears to show whose children ye are of nature. If your wicked counsel
had taken effect as God forbid it should very few true fauerers of the Lords
verite had been about the king this hour / least they should sometime have
infourmed him of your papistrie / and so detected you of your manifest
treason. Soche hauock began you to make in the court / as cruel Haman
thought to have made among the faithful Hebrews belonginge to good queen
Hester / had not God by the high wisdom of our said king prevented your
subtle practyses.

This mischefe ones performed / ye thought easelye to have deluded his nobl^s
/ and so in the end to have brought in again your great Patriarch of Rome /
and so layserlye to have made of him an other king Johan. But thanks be given
always to our eternal lyuinge God / for delyueringe his ^ellent may ste
with his most faithful subjects from the snares of your craftye compassinges
And how so ever this writing of mine shall be taken / yet is it a true tale /
and so much the more of his majesty to be marked / that your forefathers and
you have been trayters always for your Romish fathers sake to emprours /
kings / prin ces / and other wordlye governors all Christendom over /
specially sens the craftye vpcrepinge of that holy father of yours. I doubt
not but the most famous writers by all ages sens the churches beginning will
make this my saying good / yet have their cronicles written the best of them
to hyde their hypocresie and falshede.

What Christen blood has beneshed-betwyne empire and empire / kyngedome and
kyngedome / as betwyne Constantinople and Almayne / England and france /
Italye and Spain for the Bisshoppes of Rome / and how many cruel wars at
their prestes calling on / it were to much either to write or to speak.
Always have they been workinge mischefe in their idell generation to obscure
the verite of God. I say yet ones again that it were very necessary for the
kings worthy majesty with ernest eyes to mark how God has graciouslye
delyue red both him and his people from your troblouse termaga^t of Rome which
before made all Christen kings his common slaves. And to be ware of you hollow
har ted trayters his spiritual promoters / co^syderinge that your proud
predecessors have always so wickedlye used his graces noble prog^itours the
worthy kings of this realm sens the conquest and before.

Who ouerthrewe king Herolde / subduynge all this land to the Norma^ny^-who
procured the death of king William Rufus / and caused king Steven to be
thrown in preson: Who trobled king Henry the first / and most cruellye vexed
king Henry the second: Who subdued and poisoned king Johan: Who mourthered
king Edward the second / and famished king Richard the second most
vnsemynglye: besides that has been wrought against all the other kings also:
To him that shall read and throughlye mark the religiouse acts of Robert the
Archebisshop of Canterbury / of Odo / Eg^inus / Anselmus / Randoll of Durha^ /
Rafe of Chychestre / Alexander of Lyncoln / Nig^lius of Holy / Roger of
Salysbury / Thomas ^cket / Steven ^angton / Walter Stapylton / Robert Baldock
/ Rychard Scrope / Henry spe^ser / Thomas Arundell / and a great sort more of
your anointed auncetours / pontifical prelates / mytred mommers / mad mastrye
workers / ryuged ruff^rs / roche ted rutters / shorn sawcye swy^ olles / it
will euidentlye apere that your wicked generacyon has done all that and many
other mischeues more.

By these your filthy forefathers and soche other / has this realm been
always in most miserable captivity either of the Romans or Danes / Saxons or
Normannes / and now last of all under the most blasphemouse Behemoth your
Romish Pope / the great Antichrist of Europa / and most mighty mayntener of
Sodom and Gomorre / till God by the strong power of his eternal word gave
our noble king a clear victory over him. How vnchristenlye your said
predecessors have used the rewlers of all other Christen realms / it were to
long to write. I reaken it therefore high time for all those Christen princes /
which pretend to receive the Gospel of saluacyo^ / and accordynglye after
that to live in mutual peace and tranquillite / for ever to cast ye out of
their preuye counsels / and utterlye to seclude you from all administracyous /
till soche time as they find ye no longar wolves but faithful feaders / no
destroyers but gentle teachers. For as saint Peter does say. i. Petri. v. ye
ought to be no lords over ye people of your dioceses / but examples of
Christen meekness. Who sees not in these days that you blodye bishopp^s of
England / Italy / Sicell / France / Spain / Portingale / Scotland / and
Irelande be the ground and original foundacyon of all controuersyes / scysmes
/ variaunces and marres betwixt realm and realm at this present: As sure as
the lord lives it is the subtle serpent of Rome and your wylye viperouse
generacyon forth ^in ge from him which has sturred up ye first mouers thereof /
confedering the^ with ye Tur ke or great Barbarossa / utterly to destroy the
Christen common welthe. As in deed for your cause and his it was / that the
French king Frances first began that ungodly enterprise. ye feel it at
your fyngars ends that your father is syke to false / ye perseyue the daily
decay of his false and usurped power. Where upon ye consydre your own
private powers / inordinate pride / covetousness / voluptuouse lyuinge /
lechere / idelnesse / tyranny / and vain glory to follow sone after. And
that causes you to calke for his kyngedome so fast / to cloyne for his
coblarie / and to clought up his old cloak again. If ye speak ought against
him / it is from the tethe and for fear of the halter only. He has never the
less both your hearts and good will / and lacks neither your counsell^or
help preuilye / to the uttermost ye can do / as apereth by your daily
works. Else could he never continue as he does / nor yet be so strong as he
is. Vvele / do all that ye can in the world to his holdinge up / piece / patche
/ cobble / clought / cloyne / calke / and do the devil and all besides / when
the apple of iniquite is full type / he will fall of himself and a ye ye all
no leave. And than will all these your labors be in vain. Consydre first of
all both his beginning and yours.

Never came ye in with your myters / robes / and rings by the door as ded the
poor Apostles / but by the wyndowe vnrequyred like robbers / thieves / and
manquellers with Simon Magus / Marcion and Menander. Never was your proud
Pontifical power of the heavenly fathers plantynge / and therefore at the last
it must up by the roots. ye must in the end be destroyed without hands.
Daniel. viii. Inuisyblye shall ye be stryken as was the great tyrant
Antiochus. ii. Match. ix. With the mighty breathe of Gods mouth which is his
word inuincyble / shall your false kyngedome be consumed. ii. These. ii. and
Heb. iiii. This reken I suffycient to declare you both to God and to manne most
spyghtfull trayters unto them that will not be wilfullye blind.

Now to prove you spiritual thieves to ye common people / is the second part
of my purposed writing. ^arder need we not to seek for a proof of this / than
your own open acts. How long have ye kept the eternal testament of Christ
under your filthy fere from ye peoples reading / which is ye lively food of
their souls: yea / how many innocent Christen creaturs have ye most cruellye
murdered / to cause them to abhorte it: Not many years past ye brent a godly
woman at Couentre for having but one chapter of sainet Matthewes Gospel / and
an other manne at London for having saint Ioh^s Apoca lype / besides that ye
have done in other quarters else of the realm. Some burned ye in Johan Vv^ues
time and after for not allow^nge your pilgrimages / some for not beleuynge your
pardons / some for not fa^ynge the frydaye / for not obseruinge your ^ent /
some for your purga torie / some for your images / some for not prayinge to
dead saynctes of your making / some for your howsell at Easter / some for
not cr^pinge to the cross / some for not goinge processyon / and some for ho
ly water / and for other vain tryfels of your own inuentinge.

Why Vvynchestre hynge Thomas Sa^ye a man learned / in his porters lodge at

for not allowynge the Pope / Thomas Bylneye at Norwych only for preaching the

An thonye Person / Johan Testwode / and Johan Fenemor at Vvyndesore with a

To long were it far to recite all your mastryes of mischefe / whom ye have
always practiced to defuse Gods word. Never were ye yet contented that that
sede of salvation should fructifye among the people / but evermore ye have
stopped the sweet blast thereof / to do the devil your father a pleasur /
Apoc. vii. A few years a go when it began first to flotishe / ye caused one
Summers with serten other more openly to burn New Testa mentes in the mids
of chepe at London. And as ye perseyued that it still increased magrye your
hearts under the auctorite of our most worthy king / than roared you like
rude rampyon rauenours / than raged also your rank rabble of Romish ruffelers
in their side swepynge gowns / their shaven crowns / cappes / and typpettes /
like the charminge channters of Bell. Specially wode Vvynchestre / lewd
London / lurkynge Lyncolne / dreamynge Dur^am / york without wytt /
chatteringe Chychestre / smiling Salysburye / fleryng friar wattes / and that
double faced trayter Wilson / namynge it full of errors and very ill
translated.

Oh idell idyotes and abominable hy pocrites. Shame ye not at all so
euidentlye to lie and so boldelye to blaspheme? Never were ye able as yet to
match the^ whose just labors ye reprove: and though ye were / ye have not yet
done it to the pro fight of other. ye are those wild swyne / lewdeshepardes /
and foxes which has roted up the lords vine yearde. Psalm. lxxvii. Esa. iii.
Hier. xii. Can. ii. Never do you repare when any thing is therein decayed /
but contynuallye murder all them that would gladlye do it. Mat. xxi. Mark.
xii. Luc. xx. In the first chapter of Sapience is it mencyo ^ed how terryble
sentences ye shall geu^ against your selves at the latter day. (...) hortyble
fea re shall ye there confess openly that all has been dampnable f^lyshnesse
that ye have gone abought / that ye have ^rred from the truth / that ye have
been wilfullye ignorant / that ye have tired your selves in the ways of
wickedness and destruction / and so forth.

Before your own faces will I yet lay more largelye your own abhomina ble
fruits or good works as ye call them / be ashamed of them / yfye list. you
mastre wyncharde of Vvynchestre broyled in saynet Georges field beyond Sothwar
ke one gyles a Ioynar with one of the queen's servants and a paynter before
five a clock in the morninge / least the common people should have known your
lewd legerdemayne by their last confessyons. And you blodye Bishop boner ded
murder a godly young manne in Newgate only for reading the Bible in Pau les
/ whose life was well known to be vnrebu^eable among men / besides your
tyrannouse handelynge of others for the same / notwithstanding the kings
auctorite. you two blind Babylon braggers with your oyled adherentes made
Alexandre Seton a notable learned manne most miserably to recent for your false
fre will / William Tolwyn for your holy water making / Thomas Becon for your
images / your chastity / and your satisfaccids / Robert Wisdom for your
saints veneracion / your ceremonies / and the Popes old relygion / with
soche other.

yet was not your frettynge furye all qualyfyed thus / but styllye raged in
your former frenesye not unlike Pharaoes fer ce knights / and ones again ye
bewytched the parliament house / provoking them most pestylentlye to depryue
the common people all together of the Bible readyng. Only was it than admitted
to. iii. degrees of men / to gentle men / mer chandes / and Prestes / all
artyfycers and men of the common sort clerelye secluded / as though God were
parcyall / not willing his laws / precepts / and sweet promyses to be known
to poor men to their souls salvation. But false and craftye are ye in you^

played (...) and sange bawdye songs / blasphe^ge God and corruptinge men's
consciences* never blamed them / but were ve very well contented. But sens
they persuaded the people to worship their Lord God a right according to his
holy laws and not yours / and to acknowledge Jesus Christ for their only
redemer and sauer without your lowsye legerdemaynes / ye never were pleased
with them / when they tell you as the truth is / that your Romish father
has played the cruel Antichrist / and ^ou his false phesicyanes in holdinge
the Christen multitude so many hondreth years in soche dampnable darkness of
sprete without repentance / ye take it vnpacientlye s^kinge their destruction
for it.

Never repent ye your many fold mischeues be they never so manifest / but are
always redye with all ingyns possible to fall to them again. ye are not
ashamed that ye have before time depryued (...) people of all godly knowledge
by with holdinge from them the scripturs. But with toth and nail ye labor it
afreshe with all craftye cloyninges / to make them both blynd^ and ignorant / as
I have proved here before / (...) think the denyls in ^ell are not of a more
perverse mind nor (...) more ways to the souls destruction / than you.
Nether will you enter into the kyngedome of Christ by a true repentance and
faith in his holy promises / nor yet suffer any other that would gladlye do
it. But rather on every side ye stop vy the high ways there unto / least
they should believe and so receive salvation.

Nothing plesaunt is it unto your lordelye cares / to hear that we are
justified by Christ's only deservings. Nether do ye think it greatly to
your advantage / that we without your lowlye beggerye should be saved in his
blood shedynge. Slaunderouslye report ye the instructours of our time both to
preach and to write against good works not for any devotion that you have to
do them / specially if the scripture has commanded them. But to have soche
wicked worke^ fulfilled as your filthy father and you have commanded for
your own pryuate profyght and lucre / ye play Pha rao / Cayphas / Nero /
Traianus / with all tyrauntes parts besides. The faith which is lyuelye and of
value before God can no more be without good works / than the clear sun
apering can be with out bryghtnesse or the burning fire with out his natural
heat.

That faith which aryseth of the Gospel preaching / brings forth the worcester
kes of the Gospel which are the wholesome fruits of the sprete / as love /
gladness / peace / patience / gentylnesse / goodness / long sufferynge /
faythfulnesse / mehenesse / chastity / temperaunce / with soche other like.
Galat. v. These good worcester kes have not ^ou to be justified by / as we se in
your daily living. These be not they therefore that ye take for ye good worcester
kes of mynys iustificacion. I wot / ye good works that ye have cassed upon
before ty me / were the goyng^ to pardons / the se^ynge to images / the prayinge
to dead saynctes / the taking of holy water / the hearing of Mattens and
Mass without understanding / the wearinge of bedes / the offering of
candels, the bearing of palms and ashes / the ydell bestowynge of your holy
days / the coming to confession / the crepynge to the cross / the payenge
to the Paschall / the fasting of saynctes vigils / the prayenge for ass
Christen souls / the buysdynge of monasteryes and cha^teryes / the chat myng^
of churches and chalyces / with a thousand super^icyons mo^ / for your
commodyte and advantage.

The good works that we behold in your daily conuersacyon / for all your
bold brag^s of good works / are but the filthy fruits of the flesh as say
not ^oule does call them / for we se nothing in you b^ hawty^sse / bayneglorye
/ coue tousnesse / pr^de / hatred / malice / manniss lauc^r / banketynges /
glotonye / dronkenesse / slow the / sedicyon / ydolatrye / mytchecrast^ / (...)
/ (...) / (...) / besides your filthy feats in the dark when women are not
redye at hand. What ye apere in the sight of them which have no godly
understanding / I can not well tell you. But well I wot that ye seem unto us
with your iustifyeng works very pestilent ydols / as* zacharias says ye
are. zacha. xi. God requires mercy of his true beleuers / and nether your
unsavory sacrifyces nor yet your faint feeble ceremonies / D. see. vi. Math.
ix. Gal. iiii.

Though we do afferme with saynct Ia mes / that faith to be ydell / dead / and
boy de which occupyeth not good works soche as the Gospel prescribes / yet
grant we not those good works to be any part of our iustificacyon before
God / considering that to rest alone in Christ's good deservings which are
ours only by faith. Not for our own ryghtouse works (says saint Paul, are
we saved / but by the mercy of God through Jesus Christ / Titum. iii. Non
other is our universal righteousness before God / (says the Prophet) than
is a filthy clo the stained with a womannes floure^. Esa. lviiii. Semynge it
is that we become neweme^ne / Ephesians. iiii. that we be have our selves as the
ministers of God / that we walk in a new Christen life after the Gospel. i.
These. ii. that our light apere before men to the glory of God / Matthew. v.
and that we serve no more sin from hence forth / Romans vi. but that our daily
co^uersacyon be in heaven. Phil. iii

yet when we have done all this by the graciouse gift of God / we may not there
unto ascribe any part of our iustificacyon with the Pharise / Luke. xviii.
but say with the poor publicane / God be merciful unto me / I am truly an
unprofitable servant / I have not done so much as my duty / Luc. xvii. I am
not able to think a good thought of myself / much less than to do a good
work to my iustificacyon. ii. Cor. iii. Thus do we not condemn good works /
as you like false liars report us / but we allow them most hyghlye / as they
arise of the Gospel and not of your beggarly traditions / and so teach we
them in their right kyn de. Though your forefathers in all ages sens their
beginning has murmured against the verite / yet raged they never so
unreasonable as you do / nether sought they so cruel kinds of death for the
servants of God.

What the cause should be of this your frantyk furye / it is easy to
conjecture / your water is seane now a days / your sycknesse is known / and
your longinge perseyued. We se now what ye are both within and without. It
has pleased our eternal God in this latter time / by his despised disciples
to manifest the great Antichrist to the universal world / of whom your Pope
is the head and you his malignaunt members. No longar are ye like with your
abhominacyons to sit in the holy place / in the temple of God / in the secret
consciences of men. Matthew. xxiiii. i. Corinth. iii. ii. These. ii. But as
unlawful ^yars and sellars / robbers and thieves / ydolaters and murders / to
be driven out with whyppes / Johan. ii. Luc. xix. Mar. xi. Math. xxi. This is
the only cause of your blusterynge and blowynge / your roaringe and ragynge
/ your impresonynge and but^ynge of the said godly ministers / be they
writers or preachers / players or syngers.

Never the less your terrible turmoylyng yet takes the verite effect in
them whom God has appointed. My word (says the Lord) shall not turn again
void / but accomplysshe my mind and prospere in them whom I sent it unto.
Esa. lv. Against your selves work ye in your daily doyinges / yet perseyue
ye it not. In the sharp shedynge of ryghtouse blood / or burninge whether ye
will / have those things been opened / whom ye have most coueted to be hid
from all knowledge. As your pardons and purga torye to be of non effect /
your pilgrymages and other peltrycs to be of no value. An other thing there
is that ye set most by / which must away also / though it cost blood in
habunda^ce as I think it wist. And that is your abominable mass / by so
many pestilent Popes divised / which were both peruerters and poysoners /
sorcerers and stynkynge Sodomit^s. By that is the gloriouse supper of the Lord
which was his own institucyon most blasphemouslye bl^myshed and brought clean
out of knowledge in the Christen church.

For a co^tynuall remembrance of Christ's death in his co^gregacyon was that
heavenly supper first ordained / and for a universal thanks geuynge for the
most fruitful benefyght of the same. In that sacred supper are the mutual
members of Christ's mystical body there gathered / perfygh^lye ^nyt together
to their head with the Joints of faith and sy^nowes of love / where as it is
truly ministered. In your Popish Mass was never yet soche godly order.
Nether is the Lords death to understanding preached / nor yet his body and
blood fruit fullye therein received. Nether are the hearers thereof persuaded to
contynuall thanks geuynge / nor yet Christenlye exhorted to a mutual love and
concord. But of the denowtest that comes to that Mass of yours one
disdayneth an other / one hates an other / one troubles an other / one
robs an other / one goes to law with another / one defyleth an others wife
/ yea sometime / one sleyth an other / besides the abominable sorceryes /
sacryleges / supersticyons / and ydolatryes which are therein daily committed.

For therein ye offer to be worshypped of the people / a sign for a sa^ / and
that has been made by a synnefull mannys hands for our eternal living God.
Thus you most execrable Antichrists have brought them from the true
worshyppynge of God / to the worshyppynge of bread and wine / two false Gods
/ (as they are used) of your Romyshe fathers appoyntynge. Never commanded
Christ his words to be preached to brea de and to wine which are but dead
things / but to soche people as had faith to believe them and to follow them
^he badde the faithful receyuers of his holy supper to take the bread and to
eat it / but never to knele to it and to worship it: That odyouse obseruacyon
was added thereunto by your Pope sens satan was set at large after his
thousand years inpresonment / Apocalyp. xx. Not without the perpetual curse
of God / Deuteronomy. xii. Apocalyp. xxii.

The eternal testament of God wherein Christ is contained both reallye and
substanciallye / ye never hold up to be worshypped / though ye fatche from
the^s the words that ye occupye / for that were nothing for your commodite.
Most co^monlye is that office done by an unlearned luske / a blind bussarde /
an assehead an idiote / an whoremonger / a dronkarde / a bellygod / traitor /
a Sodomite / a tyraunte / an unfaithful Papist / and the most knave in a
town. yea / sometime from the vometyng of his vndygested supper / or else from
the filthy occupyenge of an harlot / he comes straight to the aultre to do it
/ yet must it be thought a sacrifice of no less value and strength / than that
Christ himself offered upon the cross. And he that will not so believe it /
shall be burned for an her etique.

Oh abominable scorners and thieves / which practyse nothing else but the vttre
desiruccyon of soul. If any thing under the heavens has need of reforma
macyon / let them think this to be one which myndeth any godliness / for
never ded cruel Pharao hold the people of Israel in so wicked a captivity /
as does this supersticiouse sort of ydest Sodomites the most derelye redeemed
heritage of the Lord. If they be no spiritual thieves soul murderers /
heretics / scysmatiques / church robbers / rebels / and traitors to God
and to manne / where are any to be looked for in all the world: An other thing
yet there is which causes me sore to lament / the inconuenyencyes there upon
considered. And that is this. Although the scripturs / cronicles / canons /
constitucions / counsels / and private historyes with your manifest acts in
our time / does declare your forefathers / and you soche heretics / thenes
/ and traitors to the Christen common wilthes as has not been upon the earth
but you / yet are ye still taken into the preuye counsels both of Emprour and
king.

But what a plage it is or miserable yoke to that Christen realm where as you
bear the swing / I think it truly unspeakable though it be not seane. Oh
eternal father for thy infinite mercyes sake / graciouslye grant thy most
faithful servant king Henry of England our most worthy sovereign lord
and governor under the / clerelye to cast out of his preuye counsel house
these lecherouse locustes of Egypt and daily vpholders of Sodom and Gomor /
the Popes cruel cattle tokened with his own propre mark / to the universal
health of his people / as thou have now constitute him an whole complete king
and the first sens the conquest. For never shall he have of them / but
disseytfull workemene and hollow hatted gentylmenne. And not only that good
lord but also to depryue them of there usurped auctorite and power restorynge
again thereunto his temporal magistrates whom their proud Pope has hitherto
most tyrannouslye thereof ^yryued.

Finallye to take from them their inordinate pomp and ^yches and more godly
to bestow them / that is to say / to the aid of his pouerte and maynte^au^ce
of his common welthe. ^s for an example the noble Germaynes has gracyouslye
done before him / making of they^ monasteryes / nonnes / coue^tes / and friars
houses / scoles of Christen sernynge / hospitalles for sick people / and
convenient dwelling places for the impote^t / poor / and aged / ^eseruynge
the reest of the lan des and goods to the mayntenaunce of their cyte^s and
contrees / which godly distribucyon is much commended all Chr^ stendome over
where as it is throughlye known. Notvnknowen is it to these pom pouse prelates
/ that when those lands and goods were first delivered unto their
predecessors / it was not to the intent that they should become possessours or
lords of them / but faithful disposa^s to the use of the weak and nedye /
that Christ might so be harbored / norryshed / covered / fed / and visited in
his disseased members / as will be required at the latter day.

But whom have you harbored ye beast lie bellygoddes whom have you visited and
feddesens ye have become^ of lowlye preachers mytred modye ydols: Not the sore
and sy^ / the impotent and same, the fatherless and motherlesse / nor him that
has b^ decay^d (...) / or thrown in strong pr^son for the verite. No / but
great lords and sadyes / ler^ed men and ^owte sawers / gentylmenne / great
doctors / (...) so^he as has fat ben^fices / with a ^nde of bold brag gets
or blasphemouse swearers abought ye / to wait upon your tabl^s / to hold up
your tails in the s^rete / to keep your hounds and horses / and to conueye
you in the dark a piece for your pleasur. And this do ye for two specyast
causes / one is this / for so much as your^ selves are becomen great fordes /
ye must needs have lordelye companyons somewhat like youreselues.

Peter / James / and Johan / with the other dis^ples of Christ (whose succe^yon
ye bo^ youreselues to be were now no mete^ ^hyp for you. Never were they yet in
so^he high auctorite as you be in now. ^ther had they here any soche prche^ of
p^acye as to be called my (...) ^tyouse ^egne of covetousness that he lest
behind him upon the high mou^tay^. Math. iiii. I think not the co^t^arye but
you s^tdye struggelers will somewhat s^le at this wy homelye writing / yet
shall not that make me to l^aue of / consyd^ynge that Christ has promised.
^uce xix. that though we should hold our peace and neither write nor speak
against you in these lattre days / so hydynge his talent under the ground /
yet mold^ the domme stones do it against your ydolatrouse generation.

In vain therefore have ye made it death to impugn your mysche^s. Truly we
can no^ otherwise chose but in the power of that sprete which he has given us
boldelye to replye against your fylt^ye father Anticrist and you / though ye
should there upon make a thowsande deaths more. And I do not doubt it but in
process of time we shall in the same sprite and worcester de clerelye overthrow
that fleshl^e ch^ ^he of his / so that there shall no more there of apere / than
now does of the carnal synagoge of the Jews. The more cruel act es ye make
against us / the more ernest are we and will be / ty^ we have weded ye whollye
out of the lords vyneya^de. your holy brethren and systerne ye monks /
f^ytes / chanons / and nonnes / with your h^s pilgrims / and perdoners be gone
forth before you / think not but your selves shall follow with your myters /
shaue^ crowns / and long ryppetes arysynge out of the same soil. For Rome
that ryall cite was the orygynall mother to ye both.

^omore are you in your proud painted relygyo^ of the heaue^lye fathers
plantynge / than were they in there I dell I pocresye. And therefore ye must up by
the roots with your pompouse palaces / proud prebe^des / chapels / and
chau^teryes. The gre^ sale of your m^rytes and holy whoryshe works shall not
be able to uphold you. As the lord has given it to owr most worthy king by
the strength of his worcester de to destroy that rank ^able of Romystes so will he
grant him to sub due you al so yt cruel captains ^d shorn forcerers of that
sodomytycall kyngedome as yet left behind / to make perfyght the work that he
has begone / that ye do not herafter so wyckedlye abuse hy^ succession / as ye
have before time his most noble pro genytours. I faythfullye believe yt / that
both Achitofel and Haman shall have there just plages / ere his grace give place
unto nature / as all men must dye. ii. Reg. xvii. Hester. vii.

If it should be otherwise (as the lord forbydde both prince Edward and the
whole realm b^syde should be in most d^e danger. For though ye play now
dyogenes flies and whysper plesauntlye in the e^re / yet will ye hysse cruelly
like s^ pe^tes throwynge forth your venim wh^ ye shall se your time /
according to your subtyle and ungentle nature. Though the mermaydes song be
sweet / yet is yt full of payson (as are also your honyed thetoryckes) and
leads the^ unto death which gives the^ thereof ye h^arynge. (...) uer is
Gnato vnrydie wc his fair flat ringe feats / to bring his false matter^ to
pass where as he find yt chynge ^res. Were it not for fair speech in
hypocresye / Satan should never apere ye gloryouse (...) of light / to ye
daily perfour maunce of all his mastryes of myschefe. What (...) decays has
chaunc^d to all Chri^n ^gyons and there rulers for geuynge swyft credyte to the
fleryng^ flatteryes of your babylonyshe broad / yt were very much to write.
It shall be therefore necessary for our most worthy king / to look upon you
intyme / and both to demynyshe your auctoryte and riches leas^ ye here after
put all his godly enterpryses in hasarde. For nothing else can ye do of your
spu^all nature but work daily mysch^ues. As well may ye be spared in the
common welthe / as may kytes / crows / and bussardes / polcattes wesels / and
rattes / otters / wolves and foxes / body lyce / flees / and flesh (...) with
other deuowrynge and noyfull vermyne. For as unprofitable are ye unto it as
they / and as little have ye of the word of God to uphold you in those vain
offices of papystrye as they.

This vncommodiouse co^modite has England had of you always when ye have
been of the kings preuye counsel / and I think has now at this present
hour. That when so ever any godly enterprise is there in doying / be it
never so preuylye handeled / yet shall the Popish prelates of Italy / Spain
/ Frau^c^ / Flaunders / and Scotland have sure knowledge thereof by your
secret massengers / and you again their craftye co^ passynges to deface it if
it may be. Nether shall those realms continue long after without war /
specially if an ernest reformacyon of your shameful abuses be sought there.
And never shall the original ground of that war be known / but other
causes shall be laid to co lour it with / as that the king seeks his right /
his princelye honor / the maynte^aunce of his tytles / or the realms common
welthe / being nothing less in the end / but an vpholdynge of you in your
myscheues.

So long as you shall bear rule in the parliament house / the Gospel shall be
kept under and Christ persecuted in his faithful members. So that n^ godly
acts shall come out from thens to the glory of God and Christen common welthe
/ but you shall so sauce them with your Romish sorceryes / that they shall at
all times be redye to serve your turn. Although the kings majesty has
permytted us the scripturs / yet must the true ministers thereof at your most
cruel appointment either suffer most tyrannouse death / or else with mouth
openly deny Christ's verite which is much worse than the death. For where as
he which mannefullye suffers / declares himself an able witness of the
lord / he that cowardlye recanteth shows himself to be but a faint hearted
hypocrite / throwynge himself whollye under Antichrists yoke again. Thus
give ye strength to his laws and norryshe up his kyngedome / whom ye say with
your lyppes that ye have refused / your pestilent Pope of Rome.

ye play altogether hyck scorner under the figure of Ironia. That ye say ye
ha te ye love / and that ye say ye love ye hate. Let all faithful men be
ware of soche double day dremers and hollow hearted trayters / and think
where as they bear the rewle / nothing shall come ryghtlye forewarde nether
in faith nor commonwealth. Never find these tyrau^t^ of Sodom any place to
repentance for their contynuall murtherynge of Christ in his faithful members
/ but more and more they sin against knowledge blasphemynge the holy ghost /
to bryn ge upon themselves the more swyft dam nacyon. And as concerning their
princes / always are they at this craftye point with them / to follow their
minds outwardlye for the time / for of all men lyunge they are ever the
mosilsubtyle obseruers of time.

But be sure of this ones / that what countenaunces so ever they show before
them with lowlye sowtynge and duckynge down to the ground, yet ^ane they, all
that way which makes most to there vpholdynge in the vain gloriouse and (...)
regne of Antichrist, whether it be with the French hynge / the Turk / or the
Emprour. As now at this present time / speak they never so fair / look they
never so demu^ show they never so wise polecyes / or provide they never so
ware^ye for the kings hoos^ in bakynge / bruynge / broylynge / gryndynge /
seasonynge / saltynge / sowsynge / and sethyng / yet has the French king
their inward hearts for the great good will he bears to their Romyshe
father. yea / although the kings grace and the Emprours majesty be now
ioyntlye joined fryndes parauenture not without their procurement also for an
other purpose of theyrs / as to stop a general counsel wherein they doubt
their vttre fall) yet shall they not long so continue / if they by any other
false polecye may altre it / as I hope it shall never lie in their wicked
power to do it.

These have been always their common practyses / as they have seane their
matters in danger. And therefore they are now least of all to be trusted /
consyderyng that at this present they are in most danger of all. If this
general war set them not up again / they are never like to go forward. And
therefore hardelye they work now a tawnte for the vpholdynge of their kyngedome
/ take head to their hands who shall / yea and parauen ture to some of their
fete if God be their good lord. What other works can come from the deuyls
workynge toles / than comes from the hands of his own malyngnaunt myschefe:
who can deny these Bysshoppes and Prestes to be the instruments of satan /
understanding the scripturs and beholdynge their daily doyinges: Only
persecute they simple men unto death for beleuynge in Christ / and never for
the great ab hominacyons of ydolatrye and supersticyon.

Only are they great enemies to marriage which is holy / and never to the
stynkynge Sodom^trye that is daily used among them. No / of that they have
set up an ydos^ among themselves / calling it holy virginite and the vowed
(...) ite of prosses yea / they have so bewytched the parliament house / that
it must be honored of all England under pay^ of death though it be the mo^
filthy fruit of (...) that ever yet y^ued from (...) ye there can be a gr^
plage to a Christen realm / than to have such goo^ lie fathers of the kyn g^
preuye counsel: If wise men do judge it any other than a just plage for
our sin and a yoke laid upon us for o^ vnreuerent receyuinge of that
heavenly treasure the eternal testament of Christ / to have soche hypocrites
/ thieves / and trayters to regne over us / truly they judge not a right.

If we would (...) therefore repent our former living / and unfeignedly turn
unto our ever living God / as we find in that testament / I would not doubt
yt to I ^parde both my body and soul / that we should in short space be
delivered of this Romisshe vermyne rysynge out of the pyt bottomless /
Apocalyp. ix. which eats up all that is grene upon earth or that has taken
any strength of the living word of the Lord. For the heart of a king is
always in the hands of God and at his pleasure he may evermore turn it /
Prou. xxi. Take me not here that I condemn any Bishop or Pressed that is
godly / doing those holy offices that the scripture has commanded them /
as preaching the Gospel / prouydynge for the poor / and ministrynge the
sacraments right. But against those bloodye botchers that murder up Gods
people / and make daily hauock of Christ's congregacyon / to maynteyne the
Jews ceremonies and the Paganes supersticyons in the Christen church.

These are not Bishops but byteshepes / tyrauntes / tormentours / termaga^tes
/ and the deuyls slaughter men. Christ lest no soche disciples behind him to
sit with cruel Cayphas at the sessyons upon life and death of his innocent
members. But soche (...) in pouerte preached the Gospel / rebukyng the wicked
world for ydolatrye / hypocresye / and false doctrine / called sin /
ryghtousnesse / and judgment in the. xvi. Chaptre of Johan. Episcopus is as
much to say as a superintendent or an ouers^ar / whose office was in the
prymatyue Church purelye to instruct the multitude in the ways of God / and
to se that they were not beastlye ignorant in the holy scrip tures as the
most part of them are now a days. Pres^iter is as much to say as a seuyour
or elder / whose office was also in godly doctrine and examples of living to
gyde the Christen congregacyon / and to suffer no manner of supersticyon of Jew
nor gentyle to regne among them. And these two offices were all one in those
days / and commonly executed of one several person.

They which than were appointed to these spiritual offices ded nothing else
but only preach and teach the Gospel having assistent unto them other
inferyour officers called D^akons to ministre the sacraments than used / and
to provide for the poor / the dyseased / and aged / ^cto. vi. Christ sent not
me forth (say^) (...) Paule^ to baptyse / but to preac^ the Gospel or glad
tydyng^ of salvation in his death and resurreccyon i. Corinth. i. Roma. iiii.
No godly manne can dispyse these offices / nether yet condemn those that
truly execute them. Not only are they worthy to have a competent living. i.
Cor. ix. but also double honor after the doctrine of saint Paul^. i. Timoth.
v. But from inordinate excess of riches ought they of all men to be
sequestered / considering that the most wicked nature of Mammon is always to
corrupt / yea / the very elect if God were not the more merciful. And that
caused Christ our sauer to say unto his Apostles / ye can not serve God and
Mammon. Matthew. vi. which might be an admonyshme^t to our lordelye Bishops
when they be in their wordlye pomp / that they are not Gods servants /
believed they his sayenges as they do nothing less.

I can not think that any Christen Bishop or Pressed will be offended with
ought that I have written here / but rather prefer it to their power /
seyinge it makes nothing against them / seeking Gods glory and not their
own. And as for ye Romyshe Popes ydols / the better it will beiudged of all
Christen beleuers if they do spattle against it. My conscience does give me
that I have herin followed ye example of Christ. For like as he labored by his
daily preaching to deface the great opinyon that the people had of (...)
Pharis^s and false Bysshoppes* and to p^ace Johan Baptist and Peter in th^yr
romes / Matthew. xi. ^uc. x. So do I here to my simple porcyon that the Popes
Presies and Prelates should no longar occupye the conscience of men with their
beggerlye dead baggage above the eternal God and his living word. ii.
Thessal. ii. Daniel. ii. The which in the zele of his only verite / I desire
that lord of his bottomless mercy and for his son Jesus sake / shortly to
perfourne to the just expectacyon of his elect flock. Fynallye with heart I
desire / that those enemies of the truth be no longar given over of God and so
left to themselves / but that they may find some just way to repentance /
and so from henceforth to maynteyne the pure laws of Christ / as they have in
times past the most filthy tradicyons of Antichrist.

So be it.

Written from Basyle a cite of the (...) by me Henrye Stasbrydge in the year
from Christ's incarnacyon. 1544. and the first day of August.

An appendyce Iorned to the foreseyd Episile.
BE it known unto you brag gynge (...) / that the day after I had synyshed my
Episile / there came unto my hands an answer of your making against the
lyberall hunting of your Romyshe father the fo^e of all falshede wherein ye
show your self nether learned nor yet wise. In ded eye apere there a very
shameless gentylmanne. For where as nether scripturs nor good natural reasons
will serve you / ye fall to plain scolding like an whore of the stews. ye
stamp and ye stare / ye face / fret / and fare / as it were great N^mroth of
Babylon. Nothyn ^e else find we in your writing but boystuouse boastes /
bragges / and brawlynges / lordelye checkes / rebukynges / and tyrannycall
threttenynges / all after the fashyon of your cruel kyngedome. They that were
blind before are like to ^e so still for ought they shall learn of you It is
not your office to make them to se / ^ut to keep them ignorant still / you
Bishops can not chose but show youreselues still as ye be / even the
natural loving children of your father.

In no wise may ye suffer it / that he in his tyght colors be reuelated to
the world / least you risynge out of his right side be thrown from your vain
gloriouse dygnytees with him. Much rather had ye that all princes powers were
nothing / than the acts of that father of yours should utterly come to
naught. But seeing ye have taken so great pains to defend h^s holy quarrel /
(...) maruele what ye cause should be that ye putt yt not forth in prent that
your trayterouse brethren also might be confirmed in there obstynate errors by
ye same. If you will not shewethe cause why / than I shall ta ke ye pains to
do it for you. ye have consy dered with your self and with other your craftye
counselors / that if ye should so put for the that work of yours / ye might
chance to apere to some eyes in condempnynge this honte to allow in your holy
father his suppressed auctoryte afreshe. Take heed what ye do in any wise /
for the worl de is not now as it has (...).

Again yfye should have let it pass vntowched / ye should either have showed
your self (...) cowarde / or else have condemned utterly the. vi. wicked arty
cles of your own deuysyege for Antichrists Idell and blasphemouse wares. In
deed ye were brought to a narrow point both ways / and seem yet scat an
honest conueyar in the art of Mome bowgett. O vell / to keep your self
vpryght / ye have written against this honter. And ye think ye have gested him
out of countenance though ye have done nothing else for want of matters to
your mind. As ye d^d Ale^andre seton and other more / to who^ in co^paryson ye
were judged a very blind ass in the learning of God / but that auctoryte
(they say) makes fools bold. But my lord my lord / yfye think wraghto^
thus overthrown or yet dasshed out of countenance / ye are sore dece yued.
David will ones again lay hand upon his slynge. They be not your lor delye
lokes that shall cause him to shrynke in so just a quarrel of his lord Jesus
Christ.

I suppose your vulerned legerde maynes will encorage him to pour double upon
that Romyshe whore your malygna^t ma dame / the mother of all fylthynesse /
Idolatrye / superstycyons / hypocresye / vain glory / craft / subtylte /
falhede / Idelnesse auaryce / glotonye / lechere / sodometrye / and most
unshame fast tyranny. Let your work come a broad and not lurk thus in
corners / that your father may say ye ha ue done your part well / and your
brethren report that ye are a great pyllar of there is. Ifye will not set it
forewarde / I putt ye out of doubt that. I will do it to your sma^ honest /
that ye kings mageste may se and all ye realm besides what a forsworn
gentylman ye are / and what an wholesome cou^seller with. ii. Faces in an who de
/ suppressynge the gospel for your old relygyon to keep your father s^yll in
England. Non otherwise shall it apere tha^ your own copye is. N^yther will I
add unto it one word (as god shall judge me) nor yet demynyshe it in one
tyttle.

But as ye delivered it to your dear fryn de Doctor westo^ / so shall it be
seen in eve rye point. ye shall not deuye it to be your own act / if ye said
O vesto^ be (...) ^amyned. How heretycall / trayterouse / and blasphemouse the
s^rmon was which the said O ves^on preached a^ ye (...) on the tewesdaye in the
^aster weak / a great sort of ye hearers can tell. And although he was there of
accused / yet after the anointed broad had swarmed on^s together soche a cloak
was cast upon it that it was judged a good matter and a very catholyek sermon.
Now to you again my lord because ye shall well know that. I have your work
/ I sygnyfye here unto you / that this is th^rof the superscripcyo^ or title.
The ^amynatio^ of a proud pre sumptuouse honter. Thus fare ye well for this
tym^ / and the lord send you herafter a more godly sprete / (...)

Amen.
