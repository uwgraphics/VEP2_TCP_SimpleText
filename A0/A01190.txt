AN ORATION MADE TO THE FRENCH KING, BY THE deputies of the National Synod, of
the Reformed Churches of France; together with his Majesty's answer to the
same, the 27. of May. 1617.
THE NATIONAL SYNOD OF VITRY in Britain, having deputed to his Majesty the
20. of May, 1617. these Reverend gentlemen, Piere Hesperien, Pastor of the
Church of Saint Foy, in base Guienne; Denis de Bouteroue, Pastor of the Church
of Grenoble in Daulphinois; Albert de Mars, Esquire, Lord of Balene, and
Ancient of the Church of Maringues, in high Auergne; and William Gerard,
Esquire, Lord of Moussac, Ancient of the Church of Moussac in base Languedoc,
the 27. of the said month, when the Lord Hesperien spoke to the King in this
tenor following:

SIR,
Behold here prostrate at your feet, in our persons, all your subjects that
profess the reformed Religion, represented in the National Synod, by your
permission, summond and assembled, and under your Royal authority, in the
town of Vitry, which has deputed us toward your Majesty, to testify unto
you the extraordinary passions of joy, which have and do possess your said
subjects, as also the solemn and unfeigned thanksgiving which they have, and
daily do give unto Almighty God, in that they now behold your present estate
in perfect peace and repose, your authority in full force and vigor, and your
Royal person in absolute liberty; and all this, by the no less noble, then
sage resolution, which you undertook and executed, for his just punishment,
that disturbed your Realm, suppressed your authority; and yet which is worst,
exposed your person to most eminent peril and danger. Something indeed very
extraordinary concurred with this action, but so as a divine and miraculous
hand was not also herein wanting; which (as it were) in a moment turned all
the storm into a calm, war, into peace; fear, into all security; danger;
into deliverance; and an odious tyranny, into a most just and lawful
government. For now (as it were) by a new inauguration of your Majesty in the
Crown of France, France her self now clearly discernes that she has a King,
and all the world no less apprehends, that there is a King in France, worthy
to reign and rule. Now, that your Royal self holds the raines of the State,
all your subjects are ready to yield you, that most humble obedience and
submission which they owe, but more particularly those of the reformed
Religion, who are very prompt and willing, to offer up for your service, their
goods, their honors; yea, and their lives themselves. And for this effect the
Convocation and assembly; which deputed us to your Majesty was no sooner met
and conuented, but they solemnly swore and protested, and in the name and
behalf of all the reformed Churches within your Realm, enjoined us;
representing their several charges, to protest and swear in their names, that
we will never go aside, nor start from that most humble obedience and service,
which (as your natural subjects) we owe unto you. Whereunto we further find
our selves more straightly obliged, by the many and great benefits that we
received from the late deceased, Henry the Great, of most glorious memory,
your renouned Father; by others, which it has pleased your Majesty to continue
toward us; and by many more, which we daily attend and hope for from you. And
though we firmly believe, that the maintenance of your authority and
dignity, is our best security; and the establishment of your Crown, our
peace and quiet: yet we deem our selves hereunto yet more nearly bound by the
bond of our Religion, and consciences, which conformable to the holy
Scriptures, daily teach us, that we must be subject to all superior powers;
and that the resisting of them, is but an evident opposition to Gods will and
ordinance: who (we know) has elected, and seated you in your throne; set the
Crown on your head, put the Scepter into your hand, and planted correspondent
royal virtues, and sufficiencies for discharge of the same in your noble
heart. So that under him, we acknowledge no other Sovereign, but your Majesty.
Our firm belief is, that between God and the King, there is no middle, nor
third person. To call this received verity into any doubt or question, among
us, is taken for convinced heresy; and to make thereof so much as any
problematicall argument, is reputed an odious and capital crime. This lesson,
Sir, we have learned from our Predecessors, which we firmly believe, and
diuulge all over, both with lively voice, and in writing, recommending the same
likewise both by precept and example, to all those that shall succeed us. And
therefore we do promise so much again unto our humble selves, in the behalf
of your Majesty, that being undoubtedly confirmed and resolved of our fidelity,
your Majesty will propagate toward us the benefits of your former edicts: your
royal ears will be always open to hear our complaints, and peazing equally
the balance, you will be ready to do us justice, as we will likewise be ready
every day, to plant more deeply in your royal heart an immutable and constant
belief, that we will ever be ready to live and die in the state of your most
faithful and obedient servants, and subjects.

Whereunto the King replied in these words: I thank you all, continue you in
my good and loyal service, and be assured that I will be your good King, and
maintain you in the privileges of my Edicts. Then taking the letter which the
Synod wrote to him, he gave it to Mounsieur de Pont Chartrain, commanding him
to read the same, and frame an answer.

THE LIFE, CARRIAGE, AND PROGRESSIONS OF THE unworthy Marshall d' Ancre.
Gentlemen:
IT was a Lynceus (but not the son of Aphareus) one of a more clear and
penetrant sight, which observed even in the depth of the Kings noble heart, and
in the secret thoughts of his faithful subjects, the sighs that they daily
poured forth, before his Divine Majesty, to be delivered, together with this
whole poor Realm and Kingdom, from the tyranny and oppression, whereinto
they were reduced and brought, by the deep subtilty, and insupportable pride
of Cochino; in whom questionless (if Metempsycosis, or Pythagoricall
transmigration could take place) the devilish soul of Aman, the son of
Amadathi, the Agagean, resumed another body. But to the end every one may be
advertised of the true cause of these sighs, you shall conceive by this brief
recital, that Cochino was borne in Florence, of poor and mean place; and as
such an one, grew to affect amorously a Ioyners daughter, who was called
Leonora Galligaia, as men said; she being placed at the first as an inferior
chambermaid, with the Princess Maria de Medices, whose close stool she
oftentimes cleansed and emptied: within a while her continued services, joined
with some liberality of mind and spirit observed in her, brought her to be
raised and preferred to be in the said Princess her chamber as an attendant
gentlewoman; which Princess at last coming into France, to be joined in
marriage with Henry the Great, the said Elenor came along with her, and she was
also followed by Cochino; when arriving at Marcelles, a little boy of about
twelve years old, was able with all ease, to carry their whole luggage and
furniture; being a French youth, and a Parisian borne, who died not long since,
of a dyssenterie, or bloody flux, in the street called de Beau-bourg: when the
Princess came to be Queen, out of a frank and most noble disposition, she
advanced all her followers, and peculiarly the said Elenor; who humbly
requested her, that she would permit her to marry the said Cochino, which at
last she compassed, with the Kings pleasure and consent. Then either of them
insinuating themselves more and more into the Queens favor, they grew to
great fortunes and means, by commending unto their Majesty's diverse men's
suits; who having occasion to sue unto them, were urged by important occasions
and businesses, of what nature or quality soever. God at last, for our own
unworthiness, called the King to his mercy, depriving us of that glorious Sun;
leaving to succeed him, Lewis the thirteenth, (whom God maintain and prosper)
being then but ten years old, who presently, by the general voice and consent
of all France, was invested in the flowers de Luce, and acknowledged for King;
and the Queen his mother, a lamentable, desolate, and disconsolate Lady, by
the same general consent was proclaimed Regent. The natural benignity, and
noble inclination of this great Queen, suffered her not to fear, either
deceit, or treachery, but being her self of an untainted and innocent soul,
she thought every one had the like; especially such as were so far favored,
to come freely into her Majesty's presence, and had the credit to speak to her
in private. Now was the time, when this ambitious Cochino, began by the
isntrumental offices of his wise, to deprave and detract from the Kings loyal
and good servants; for presently he then caused Syllery the Chancellor, and
his brother, to be dismissed and driven from his presence; and under the cloak
and color of Justice, to take from the Parliament of Province, their
resplendant Son, under this color to propagate his ambition; and yet this
presently not giving him such full contentment, he must needs take from him
the public Seals, for to confer them upon one of his own creatures; then
he must needs remove from about the King, Mounsieur le Cheualier de Vandosme,
his beloved Minion; then his faithful servant Luynes; forthwith his vigilant
and careful Physician Erouard, and then his good Counselors; presently he
gave one office to one, another to another: to conclude, at one instant he cast
al these Officers in a mould; the Keeper of Seals; the Secretary of Estate,
and the Controller general of the Treasuries; by little and little, contesting
with the greatest, for the place of chief Gentleman of the Kings chamber,
using all the power possible to marry his daughter with Mounsieur the Duke of
Longueuill: who no ways bending to this contract, was in great danger to have
lost his government of Picardie, and all his credit at Court, being enforced to
eclipse and retire himself. During these entercourses, that sage Prince, the
Count de Soissons was called to heaven; whose government the Queen kept in her
own hands, to appease the great iealousies of those that were competitors for
the same; constituting therein Cochino, sometimes Marquess d' Ancre, and
Marshall of France, for her Lieutenant. Here then you see him Lieutenant of
Normandy, being Master and Commander of the principal places in the same,
which he fortified with Bastions, Ditches, and Cannon, which he conveyed
thither out of the Arsenall at Paris. But while these occurrents thus passed,
he drained the Bastile of fourteen millions, bitterly checked that Imperial
Parliament, about the demonstrations of his disorders, preventing the Princes
and great Lords from conuenting and assembling therein. At last he found a
means that the Princes forsook the Court, and Mounsieur le Iay President of
the said Parliament, the Kings most loyal and trusty servant, was committed
prisoner to the Castle of Ambois, under a colorable and counterfeit pretext:
he procured that neither his Majesty, nor his faithful Counsel, gave any
ear neither to the manifestation of Mounsier the Prince, nor to the complaints
and intimations of the other Princes. One of which, that is to say, Mounsier de
Vandosme, he caused to be imprisoned (but that he made a cunning and subtle
escape); so that by these means he laid the foundation of a dangerous war,
and of great leuies of soldiers, arming near kinsmen one against another, as
Mounsier de Guyse against Mounsier de Mayenne his cousine german, and thus
ruinating the Kings poor subjects: so that at last, by the wise and discreet
courses of my Lords the Dukes de Neuers, de Ventadour, Chancellor Syllery, and
other ancient Officers of the Crown, a good Treaty should have been drawn,
the King being then at Tours, and the said Lords Princes at Loudun. But because
the said Cochino perceived, that the power of these the Kings two faithful
servants to his mind, crossed his ambitions, making rather use of his own
ministers, and vpstarts, whom himself termed Agents of a thousand Frankes, of
whom he had to the number of eight hundred; and wonderfully abusing the Queens
exceeding clemency and bounty, as also the fear and jealousy, that both by
himself and others he possessed her withal, that she should be careful of
her self, and of the Kings minority and youth: he caused Mounsier the Prince
to be taken prisoner on a thursday the first of September, anno 1616: and so
consequently all the rest, upon this, dispersing themselves, not daring to
return, they were proclaimed Rebels, attainted of high Treason, all their
goods confiscated, (part of which came into his own hands) and then three
Armies were hereupon raised to take the spoil of the^, and so bring them in
alive or dead. Mounsieur de Guyse went of the one part, to seize on Mounsieur
de Neuers, whom he dispossessed of many places: on the other side Mounsieur de
Montigny and Mounsieur the Count de Auuergne, went directly to Soissons with 40
Canons; Cochino by an imprinted letter, promised to the King forthwith an
Army of five thousand foot, and eight hundred horse, which he entertained for
four months at his own charge; sending out in the mean while three or four
hundred Spies, or Intelligencers, over all the country, especially into Paris,
that by this means he might discover and know all such as ordinarily exclaimed
against his Tyranny, causing diverse gibbets to be erected within the city
whereupon to hang his opposites, though they armed themselves but for the Kings
true and faithful service. While all this thus passed, the Kings loyal
servants, who saw their Masters captivity, and the unworthy entreatie of his
Majesty, being now of years, of greater maturitie and ripenes, they conuented
together, and began to enter into a sacred union, to shake off this yoke of
Cochino, and all his assistants, which aimed at the destruction of all the
Princes, and so to seize on their goods (I mean not only of those absent and
withdrawn, as my Lords de Vandosme, de Neuers, de Longueuille, de Bouillon,
and de Mayenne, but also of them present) as my Lords the Count de Auuergne, de
Guyse, Ioinuille, the Cardinal of Rhemes; then of my Lords the Prince of Conde
prisoner, and Count de Soissons very young, but endued with an excellent
spirit, and a noble impe of great expectation and hopes, for his Prince and al
France; then of the most eminent Officers of the Crown, then of Sieur Erouard
chief Physician, one most loyal to his King; of Sieur de Luynes, and at last
of the King himself. All this effected, Mounsier should have been seated in
the Throne very young, the Queene-Mother Regent, himself Mayor of the Palace,
which dignity he meant again to re-erect; and then in a little time, having
all the authority in his own hands, no body opposing nor contradicting him,
(all the race of Bourbon clean extinguished, through the sudden death of
Mounsier the King) Cochino should then have been mounted upon the Throane, and
then his wife being made away by some privy practice of his own, he might
have married whom he would at his pleasure. Here you may see a well wouen web,
for the amputation whereof, God, who always preserves this kingdom, put into
the heart of Lewis (beloved of God) the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
as he did sometimes into Solomon; and so strengthening the arm of Sieur de
Vitry, his faithful Guardian and Captain, caused it to discharge his just
choler, upon the head of this Salmoneas, which being too favorably dealt
withal, according to the opinion and judgment of the people, when he was
buried secretly in the night, they dis-interred at high noone day, and thinking
him unworthy of burial, they dragged his corpse to the foot of Pont neuf;
there hung up by the feet, on a gibbet he had lately erected: then they cut
off his nose, and his ears, plucked out his eyes, couched his head, cut off
likewise his arms, and shameful parts: this being done, it was trailed again
through the streets of the City, beaten, and laid upon with cudgels, part of
it burnt before his own house, and some of it once again retrailed and burnt
the second time, and what remained was at last thrown into the water. Now, the
longer they had been mute, no man daring to speak against him, the more they
talked, sung, and writ so loudly, and publicly, that all the streets
re-echoed with the exulting joys and outcries of the inhabitants. The blow was
no sooner given, but a miraculous change and alteration was observed over all
France, especially in Paris; for every one assumed to himself a new form,
through such an admirable pleasure and contentment. The Army before Soissons,
was presently by the Kings commandment dissolved; the Lords de Vandosme, de
Neuers, de Mayenne, de Longueuille, fell down incontinently at his Majesty's
feet, who received them with a free and royal heart, to the confusion and
shame of all Cochinoes creatures; who (at the arrival of that grave and
prudent Chancellor, whom his Majesty sent for, and reconfirmed him of his
Counsel; of the Lords, de Vair, restored to the keeping of the public Seals,
President Ianin, and Villeroy, together with others, who had been formerly
dismissed and chased away by this Haman) vanished, and were dissipated, like
mists or fogges at the arising of the Suns clear beams. Cochinoes life
(sometimes Marquis de Ancre, and Marshall of France) requires a great and
entire volume, to express and relate it at large, the which, attending and
expecting from the learned pen of Piere Matthew in his History, I have here
abridged in as brief a form as possibly I could, for a note and mark unto
those, which may peradventure hear talk but of a parcel of his infernal
ambition: and to be a just terror to all such Nimrodes, from attempting to
scale the heavens, and to bandy against lawful Kings, who are the anointed of
the Lord, principally against such spirits and minds, void of all gall or
bitterness, but clement and tractable, being of the same years that our King
Lewis the 13 (beloved of God) is: for whom all France ought daily to pray, that
he may be preserved, and blessed, with a most long and happy life. God through
his omnipotent holy favor and grace, daily guard and defend him, for us,
together with all the faithful Princes, and Officers of his Crown; guiding and
instructing his heart, for the maintenance and propagation of his holy Church,
and the benefit and comfort of his poor people, Amen.

FINIS.
