DE CIVILITATE MORVN PVERIlium per DES. ERASMVM Roterodamum, Libellus nunc
primum and conditus and aeditus.

Roberto VVhitintoni interpret.

A little book of good manners for children / now lately compyled and put
forth by Erasmus Roterodam in latyne tongue / with interpretacion of the same in
to the vulgar english tongue / by Robert whytyngton laureate poet.

Cum priuilegio.

Erasmus Roterodam saluteth a child of noble blood and of singular hope /
named Adolph. son unto the prince of Uerian.
IF that Paul very excellent was not abashed to be made after all fasshyons
/ to every person / to the end he might profyt all fasshyons of men: how
much less ought I to be grieved to play the child again in like case / for
lou^ to help youth. Therefore like as late I applied my se^fe to the youth of
Maximi^yan thy brother (whiles I fasshyoned the tongue of young children) so
now I apply my self to thy childhode / and shall teach the manners of
children: Not because thou nedest these prescriptes and rules / brought up at
the beginning of an enfant among courtye^^ / after that obtaynyng so notable
a master to fasshyon youth rude and ignorante / or (...) write perteyneth to
the / an^ that ar^e come of princes / and borne to principalyte / but for that
end that all children shall more couragyous^y learn this things / because it
is dedycate ^o the a child of great possessyon / and of synguler hope. Nor it
shall not give to al youth a dull spur / if they ^e noble men's sons to be
f^l^y given to lernyng fro chyldhode / and run in the same raze with them.

The office of fasshyonyng of chyldhode rests in many par^e^ / of the which
that which like as it is first / so it is chief: That is / the tender wytee
shall drink the seeds of love to god and his parents. Secondely that he
shall love and learn the lyberall science. Third / that he shall be instruct to
the order of his living. Fourth that fro the first ^udymen^ of youth he shall
be accustomed to cyuilite and norture. This last now I have take upon me as a
thing proper / for o^ the other three both many oth^^ (...) wri^^en m^^ny
things. And al be it this outward honesty of the body comes of the soul
well composed or ordered / natwithstandyng we se it chaunseth often times by
neglygenc^ of masters that we desire (as a thing that lacks) this grace of
honest behauour in men of nobylite and learning: Nor I deny not this to be a
very notable part of philosophy / but yet that part (after the judgment of
men in this days) avails greatly to al^re beneuolens / also to represent to
the eyes of men these laudable gifts of the soul.

It is semely and syt^ynge that a man be well fasshyoned in soul / in body /
in gesture / and in apparel: and in especyall it besemeth children all manner
of temperaunce / and in especyall in this behalf noble men's sons. All are
to be taken for noble / which exercise their mind in the lyberall science.
Let other men paynte in their shyldes Lions / Egles / Bulls / and Leopardes:
yet they have more of very nobylyte / which for their badge may paynte so
many images / as they have learned sure the lyberall scye^ce. Than that the
mind of a child well burnysshed may upon all sides euydent apere / for it
apereth most clear in the vysage or countenance.

Of the eyes.
Let the eyes be stable / honest / well set / not frownyng / which is syne of
cruelty / not wa^ton / which is toke^ of malapertnesse / not wandering and
rollynge / which is syne of madness / not twyringe and spyeng / which is
token of suspection and compasynge disceyte / nor ha^gyng down which is syne
of folly: nor afterward twynklyng with the brows / which in sign of
unstableness / nor masing as a man astonyed (And that was noted in Socrates)
nor to sharp / a syne of malice / not making synes and profers nor besy wanton
/ a token of yuell chasty^e: but representyng a mind well enstabled / and
amy^ble with honesty. Nor it is not said with out cause of antique sage me^ /
that the eye is the seat and place of the soul.

The antique pyctures she^weth to us that in old time men were of synguler
demure countenance / and looked with eyes half closed / like as in Spain
certain look as they were pore blind / as it seems to be ^ake as a fair and
amyable countenance. Likewise we learn of pictures / i^ old time they were
narowe and strayte mouthed / a sign of virtue: But that thing that of his own
nature is semely / it is taken with all men comely. All be it becomes us
sometime to be like the lopster / and to apply our self to the manner of the
regyon we be in.

Now there be certain countenaunces of the eyes / whom nature gives of this
fasshyon to one and that to an other / which chaunseth not be under my
precepts: save that gestures out of order do blemysshe not only the behauoure
and sauoure of the eyes / but also of all the body. And v^on the contrary
part gestures manerly makes that which of nature is semely to be more
comlye: and that which is of reproach / if so be it take it not away / yet it
hydeth it and does dymynisshe it. It is unsitting to look upon a man and
wynke with the one eye: For what else is it but to make blind him self? Let
leave that gesture to the fysshes called Thynnes and craftismen.

Let the brows be set up / and not bente / which is token of cruelty / not
set up t^ hye / which is syne of arrogance and proud heart / not ha^gyng in to
his eyes / which is ^yne of yuel ymagynacio^.

A forheed merry and plain / signifies a mind of clean conscience and a
gentle nature: let it not be knytte in wrincles as in an old person / not
mouynge up and down like an hedge hog / nor crooked or wri^hen like a bull.

Let not the nose thrilles be full of s^yuell like a sluttysshe person: That
vice was noted in Socrates as a reproach.

To dry or snytte thy nose with thy cappe or thy cote is all of the carte /
upon thy sleue or thine elbowe / is property of fysshmo^ger^. Nor it is not
mo^h^ more manner to dry with thy bare hand / if so be afterward thou daube
it on thy clothes.

It is good manner to dry the fylthe of the nose with thy handkercher / and
that with thy heed somewhat turned a side / if more honest persons be present.

If any snyt fall on ye ground after thou haste sny^^e thy nose with two
fyngers / by and by tread it out under thy fete. It is also against manner to
snuff with thy nose / it is a syne of malice: It is more leude to snu^^e with
thy nose / and a syne of fury if it be usual. As for such as be short
breathed / that be sick of tysyke must ^e hold excused. It is a reproach to
speak in the nose / for it is the property of crows and elephantes.

To wrie the nose is the property of scoffers and natural fools.

If snesynge chance other being presen^e / it is good manner to turn a side:
after wha^ the passion does cease / to bless thy mouth with the syne of the
cross / after to take of thy cappe and thank the^ (or desire pardone) that
said or were about to say christ help: for snesynge as gawnyng is wont to
take a way the sense of herynge.

It is goodly to say^ christ help to an other man that sneseth: And it is a
chyldes par^e to do of his cappe / if diverse that be elder be present that say
christ help to man or woman. And ^ynally to make a shyrle noise or a shrike
purposely in snesyng / or to itera^e snesyng of purpose / to the ^ste^tacio^ of
his strength is lewdness.

To stop the snesyng that nature moves is folly of such that prefers manner
before health.

The color.
Let natural color (and not counterfeit) ornate the chekes: al be it let
natural color be so mesured or ordered / that it be not altered to
shamfastnesse / nor make a child so astonyed / to bring hi^ to the deg^e (as
it is said) as it were of a man that were mad. To some children this passion
feeble is so impressed that it makes a child like to a dastarde. This leude
manner is sone correct / if a child be acustomed to live among his elders /
and be exercysed to play comedies or interludes. To puff up o^ swell in the
chekes / is to^en of a proud heart and solle^. To smyle is token of a man that
shows tr^e mind: the one is Thrafos perte / the other is Judas the traitors
part.

Let not thy mouth be stopped / that is syne o^ him that fears to take the
brethe of a another: nor let it not gape / that is token of ydio^ fools / but
closed the lyppes soft touching together. It is no good manner to set out the
lyppes and make a bow or ba^ / although great me^nes sons (going there a
multitude) use it: they shall be pardoned / as men in who^ what so ever they do
is taken as manerly / but I inform children. If the chance gapi^g / and thou
can not turn away^ or go away / close thy mouth with thy ha^dkerchife or the
palm of thy hand / after cross thy mouth.

To allow every man's words or deeds is the properti^ of fools: to apply to
no man is property of a dastarde. To show merry cou^tenau^c^ to fylthy words
or deeds / is syne of lewdness. Grinnyng and laughyng out of mesure / wherewith
all the body does shake / which passion the greeks call risus syncrusius /
that is a shake / is not semynge to any age / nor yet in a child. It is
unsitting that some laughing neye like an horse. He is vnmanerde and rude
that laugheth with wide mouth and writhen chekes / showing his tethe like a
dog that gnarreth: and it is called the laughing of Sardinia (an herb /
which eaten makes a man to dye laughyng) Let the cou^tenau^ce so show myrthe
that it do not disfygure the mouth / nor bring ^eproche of a light mind.
These be the sayenges of fools / I brast for laughter / I leap for laughter /
I dye for laughing / or any such other folisshe ^utche chance / so that he
be not willing ^o show such laughing / he must cover his face either with
a napkyn or his hand. To laugh only with out euydent cause / is sign of
folly or madness. And if so be such thing chance / it is manner to open the
cause to other / or if ye think it not mete to be showed / to bring some
cou^terfet excuse lest that any man suspecte him self to be mocked.

To byte with the tethe the nether lyppe is not manner / but syne of malice:
like wise to the upper lyppe.

Also to lycke the nether per^e of thy lyppes with thy ^o^ge. is folly.

To set o^t the lyppes and joined / as to kiss / in old time with the almayns
was judged gentylnesse / as their pictures shows.

To bleare out the tongue and mock any manne / is point of a knaves scoffyng.

Turn thy face when thou spyttest / so that thou spyt upon no man / or
spattell any man.

In like manner to scrubbe or rub with the nails other parts of the body is
fylthe / in especyall if it be done of custom and not of necessyte.

The here.
Let not thy here kyuer thy brows / nor fly upon thy sholders. Also to
ruffle the here of thy heed with shaking of thy heed / is the property of
wanton coltes. To cast back thy bussh^ fro the forheed toward the crown /
is bare manner: it is more manerly to deck or deuyde it with thy hand. To
bend in thy neck and crouche in with the sholders is the manner of s^uggartes:
to set out the breast is syne of pride / it becomes to set the body straight
up. Let not thy neck wrie upon the lift side nor on the right / it is syne
of ypocrisye / except comunycacion or some other thing require.

The sholders.
It becomes ^o hold thy sholders of a like heythe / not of ye fasshyon of a
sayle-cloth / to se^de up the one and to threst down the other / for this
negligent behauer i^ children grows unto a nature / and disfourmeth the
behauour of the body against nature.

The body.
And so they that for slouthe draws to a custom to croke their body /
causes them to be crouche backed / which nature never brought. And they that
use to hold their heed upon the one side grows in to such a custom / that
in old age they labor in vain to altre it: For young b^dyes be like unto
tender plants / which in to what fasshyon you bend them / like a ^orke / or
writhen like a cord / so they grow and wax styffe.

The arms.
To cast both thine arms behind on thy back / both ha^h the fasshyon of
slouthe / al^o of a thief: nor it is not more comely to stand or sit and ^et
thy one hand on thy side / which manner to some seems comely and like a
warryoure / but it is not forthwith honest that lyketh fools / but which is
agreyng ^o reason and nature. Other things shall be said after / when we come
to comunycacion and the table.

Privy members.
To disclose or show the members that nature has give to be covered / without
necessyte / ought to be utterly avoided from gyntyll nature. Also when need
compels to do it / yet it must be done with conuenyent honestye / ye
though no person be present / for aungel^ be ever present / to whom^ in
children basshfulnesse is a tuter and a follower of chastyte: The sight of the
which to withdraw from the eyes of me^ is honest. Much more we ought not
suffer other to touch them.

To keep thy water is against health / and hurteful^ to nature: to make water
secretly is honest. There be that teaches that a child shall keep in his
nether wind / his buttockes fast closed or clynged / but it is no manner when
thou entendest to be take honest / to alure t^ the disease and syckenesse: If
thou may go aparte do that a lone by thy self / i^ no (after the old
prouer^e) Let him close the fert vnde^ color of a coughe: or else why do not
they ^yd a man by the same manner tha^ a man ^hal not go to the draught / where
as is more danger to hold the wind than to refrain the draught. To ^y^ ye
knees laid a shoyle / or to s^a^de the legs set bowed or crooked / is the
property of bragg^rs. Let the knees join when a man sytteth / when he stands
let the fe^e join / or else a little seperat the^ a so^der. So^^ sit on this
fasshyo^ / that they cross one leg^e over the other ^ne / so^e stand their
legs joined / tra^plyng and dau^syng: ^ha^ one is the property of pensive
persons / that other of fools. The rygh^ leg cast over the lyf^ thyg^e / was
the manner of old and antique kings to sit / but now not laudable. Some of the
ytalie^s set tha^ one foot upon that other because of nurture / and stand upon
one leg after the manner of storkes / which whether it become children I
dou^e. Lykwise i^ maki^g of cur^^sy / one manner be comes i^ some place / and
in so^e place it is not comely. Some make curtesye with both knees ^owed (as
yrisshmen) and on contrary wise some do it wi^h upright body / ^ome w^^h body
s^oupyng. Some there be that judge that the curtesye of women. Some likewise
with upright body make curtesy / first bow the right kne / after the lyf^ /
which among englysshmen is laudable i^ youth. The frenchmen do bow the right
kne with a little pleasant return of the body. In all such manners in the which
varye^e or change has no repugnance with honesty / it shall be laufull to use
the manners of our natural country / or else to follow the manner of strangers /
when the manners ^e such as strange countries does allow The manner of goy^ge
neither in and out / nor hasty staggryng / of the which that ou^ is property
of wan^o^nesse / the other of men furyous and mad: for this ^olysshe going as a
hal^yng man / we wo^ commit to these clean warryours / and to such as think
it a gorgyous fasshyon to wear^ plume^ i^ their cap / albe it w^^e that
bys^hops take a pleasure in such gesture. A man that sytteth to play with his
toes / is property of foole^ ^ and to play with his fingers is syne o^ light
mind.

Of apparayle.
It is fully or suff^ciently said of the body / now of apparayle somewhat /
because apparayle is the form and fasshyon of the body: And of this apparayle
we may conjecture the haby^e and apparayle of the inward mind. Al be it this
certain manner may not be given / in so much that the fortune of all men nor
dignyte be not like: no nor the same honest or inhonest manner is in all manner
of men: finally nor in all manner of times / the same manners may please or
displease. wherefore lyk^ as in many other things / so in this manner no thing
is to be allowed or praised / after the comen proverb: To the law / to the
country / and to the time / wise men byddeth a man to enfourme him self. yet
there is in this chaunges / what thing in himself is hones^^ or not / as the
things which have no profit to the person that the apparayle is made for.
To draw after them long traynes / in women is discorned / in men it is leude.
I pray you is it commendable in cardynalles and bysshoppes? I remytte that to
the judgment of other. Light and wanton gardyng of the breche and lasyng of
the belly / was never praised in man nor woman: for this is a strange fasshyon
of apparayle that covers the secret pertes / that be shamfull to be seen. In
old time it was taken not honesty to go vngyrt or s^yt / in this days it is
rebuke to many / because they be couerd with short petyco^ and close hose late
found: albe it that come or kyrtel ^ly open / or else shorter aparell than
does cover the secret parts (which should be kept honest) when a person
stoupes / is ever dishonesty. To ^agge or to ma^gle apparayle is property of
mad men. To use painted and diverse colors / is the manner of ydiots and apes.
Therefore after the degree of ye dignyte and substance / and after the country
and the manner / let the clennes of aparayle be used: nor let it be shamefully
daubed with fylthe / nor sh^wyng lechery / wa^tonnes / nor pride. Homely
aparayle becomes youth / but without uncleanness. Some distayne the he^mes of
their lynen and woollen yuell fauordly with spots of urine and pysse. Some
bark their bosom and their sleues with a cruste of fylth / na^ with perget /
but with the fylthe of their nose and their mouth. Some there be which let
their gown ha^ge on that one side / some let i^ slyppe down to the reins /
and some think it becomes them. Like as it becomes every part of
thapparayle of the body to be clenly / so it becomes it to gre unto the body.
If thy fre^des have given to the apparayle bette^ and more gorgious / cast not
thyn eyes backwarde upon thy body / nor iette not for joy and show thy self
to other / for that one is property of apes / that other of proud pecockes.
Let other praise / be not thou aknowe^ of thy fresshe apparayle.

The greater that fortune is the more amyable and gentle be. we must pardone
mean persons to take a delight in a mean / to consolacyon of their poverty /
bu^ rich men setting forth the glory of their apparayle / shows with
reproach to other their own misery / and gets the^ self but grudg^ and
envy.

Of manners in the temple.
As often as thou come by a church do of thy cap and make curtesye / and thy
face turned toward the sacrament / salute with reverence Christ and holy
saints. And do the same whether it be in the town or in the feldes / as often
as thou see the image of the cross. Go not through a church / but with like
reverence salute Christ with a breue prayer / and that with thy cappe of / and
knelynge upon both knees. When divine service is in doing it becomes to
apply al parts of thy body to honor god. Think that Christ i^ there present
with innumerable thousa^des of angels. And if so be a man shuld^ speak to a
mortal king / with a multitude that sta^d^ round about him / and neither do
of his cap / nor make curtesye / he should be tak^ of every man / not for a
carter / but for a mad body: What a thing is it there to keep thy heed
covered stately standing / where as he is king of kings / immortal / and
graunter of immortalyte / where as honorable angels of heaven stand round
about him. Nor it makes no force if thou se them not / they se the / and it
is as sure that they be there / as though thou ^awest them with thy bodyly eyes
/ for the eyes of faith se more surely than eyes of the flesh.

It is not syttyng that some use to walk up and down in the church / and
play like Arystotles schole^s / as for walking yles / marketplace and
courts / be conuenyent / not churches that be dedycate to preach / to
mynystre sacraments and holy prayers: but let thine eyes behold the
preacher / thither bend thine ears / let thy mind be set thither with all
reverence / as though thou herdest not a man / but god speaking to the by the
mouth of a man. When the gospel is read rise up / and if thou can here it
red / devoutly when these words be read in the credo / Et homo factus est /
fall down upon thy knees / or in that wise enclyne down^ in his honor that
came down him self from heaven for thy he^the / to this miserable world. And
where as he was god he was content to become man / to thentent to make the a
god. Whiles the mass and divine service is in doing / apply thy self with
all thy body to devotion: let thy face be turned toward the altar / and thy
heart to god. To touch ground with the one kne and the other standing up /
upon the which the lift elbowe does lean / is the gesture of the wicked
jews and ge^tyles / which to our lord Jesus scornyngly did say / Hayle king
of ^ewes. Thou shalt knele on both knees / and the rest of thy body so^what
be^te down to show reverence. The remenant of the time either read somewhat of
thy book / or say thy beads / or else set thy medytacion upon celestyall
things. That tym^ to chatte in an other man's ear / is the property of such
as think that Christ is not there. To gape this ways and that ways / is the
manner o^ mad men. Judge that thou art come to church in vain / except thou
depart thence more pure and more devout thanne thou cam^ thither.

Of manners at table.
At table or at meat lett^ myrthe be with the / let rybaudrie be exyled^
sytte not down unto thou have washed / but let thy nails be pared before
that ^ no fylthe stycke in them / le^te thou be called a slouen and a great
nygarde: remember the comen saying / and before make water / and if need
require ease thy belly / and if thou be gyrde to strayte to unloose thy gyrdell
is wisdom / which to do at the table is shame. when thou wypest thy hands
put forth of thy mind all grefe / for at table i^ becomes not to be sad nor
to make other sad.

Commanded to say grace / apply thy countenance and thy hands to devout
manner / beholdynge either the master of the feast / or the image of Christ or
of our lady: at this name Jesus or his mother Mary virgyne / make curtesye with
both linees. If this office of saying grace be put to an other both take
dylygent head / and make answer with like de^oute manner. Give place with good
will to an other of the highest place / and if thou be bydde to sit in a higher
place / gen^ylly refuse it / but if a man in auctorite bydde the of^e and
ernestly / obey him manerly / lest thou should seem shamfa^t for lack of
manner. At the table lay both hands upon the table / neither joined nor upon
thy trenchour / for some unmannerly hold the one hand or both upon his belly.

To lean upon the table with both elbowes or the one of them / is pardoned to
them that be weak and feeble / by reason of age or sickness: the same in some
courtyers delycious / that think all thing well that they do / it is to be
forborne and not followed. In the mean time thou must take heed lest that thou
trouble him that sytteth next the with thine elbowe / or him that sytteth
again the with thy fete. Syttyng in the there to mo^e thy buttockes this way
and that way / is like a man that lets a blaste / or is about it: Let
therefore thy body sytte upright egally. If the napkyn be given the lay it on
the right sholder or the lift. when thou syttest wi^h greater men se thy heed
be kembed / and lay thy cappe aside / except the manner of some devotion cause
the otherwise / or else some man of auctorite command the contrary / whom to
disobey is again manner. In some countries it is the manner that children
standing at their betters table shall take mete at the tables end al bare
heed. There a child ought not come uncalled / nor let him not tarry there
unto dy^er be at an end / but after he has repasted him self suffyciently /
take up his trenchour / make curtesy and salute them at the table / specially
the greates^ person at the table. Let the cup stand on the right hand / and
the meat kny^e clean wyped / on the lift hand breed. To hold the breed in
that one hand / and break it with thy fynge^s ends / it pleases some
cour^yers: let them have their pleasure / but cut thou thy breed manerly
with a knife / not pluckyng away the crust above and under / as swet^ mouthed
men. In old times men were wont at all manner of repastes reuere^tly as a
relyke to handle their breed / by reason whereof now in this ^yme a manner
remains when breed falls to the ground / to take it up and kiss it. To
begin your repaste with drink / is property of blowbowles that drink not for
thyrste / but of use. And this use is not alonely unmannerly / but also hurts
the body. Nor ye shall not drink immedyately after brows or potage / nor
specially after eating of milk.

A child to drink oftenner than twyse or thrice at the fardest at his repaste
at table / is neither manerly nor wholesome. Let him dri^ke ones after he has
fed a ^hyle upon ^he second dysshe / ^pecially if it be dry meat / and
again at the end of the dinner or supper / and that moderately / drink not like
a swylbolle / not suppynge or smackynge with the lyppes like an hor^e. To bolle
and drink both wine and al^ superfluously / it both hur^eth the health of
children / likewise it dystayneth the manners of children. water is mete for
youth and the hot age / or if he may not away ^herwith / or the nature of
that country is not such / or any other cause woll na^ suffer it / let him
use small ale or small w^rie / and alay it wi^h water: Or else this reward
follows to such as delight in pure wine / rotten ^ethe / bleared eyes and
droppynge / dull sight / and dull mind / and in short space to look like an
old man / before his old age. Before ^hou dri^ke ^ha we down thy meat / nor
put not thy lips to the cup but dry thy lyppes before with thy napkyn or
ha^d^ercher / specially if another man o^fer to the the cup / or when thou
drinkest of the comen cup. To look a side when thou dri^kest is a rude manner
and like as s^orkes / to wrie his neck back ward. To dri^ke all that nothing
remain in the cup / is the property of a ^hor^e. Let a child curtessy salute
again the person that saluteth him when he dri^keth / and touch the cup
with his lyppes and ca^te alytell / showing a face as tho he did drink: it is
ynough^ to light person that takes su^he manner upon him. If a ^arterly person
woll compel the ^o dr^ke / ^et a child promise to answer him wha^ he is
elder. Some when they be sca^tly set / ^orthwith they put their hands in the
d^ssh^ that is the property of wolves ramyyng / or of such (as they say) that
devour ^^es^h^ out of the boylynge lead / not yet ready to ^ate.

Se that thou put not thy hand first in the dysshe / not only because it
shewth the to be gredy / but because it is sometime joined with parel as wha^ he
takes any thing scaulding in to his mouth at vnwa^ / either he must spyt it
out again / or if he swalow it down it woll scaulde his throat: on both sides
he shall be laughed at / and take as a fool. A child must so^what tarry / to
accustom him self to forbear his appetyte: by the which counsel Socrates
being an old man could never forbere / but to drink as soon as the cup ca^e
to the table first. If a child sit at table with his betters / let hi^ sit
lowest / nor let hi^ not put his hand to the dyssh but he be bid. To threst
his fi^gers in to his dysshe of potage / is the manner of carters: but le^ him
take up the meat with his knyfe or else his forke / nor let hi^ not chose out
this or that sweet morsel out of the hole dysshe / which is the property of a
lykerous person but that which chau^seth lie toward him / which we may learn
of Homerus / in whom often is repeted this verse^ They russhed the^r hande^ in
to the dysshe that stod^ before them. And if tha^ or this morsel be very
deyn^is leave it to an other / and ^ake of that which is nex^. And like as it
is the manner of a gloton ^o threst his hand in to every part of the disshe /
so it is unmannerly to turn the dysshe up so do^ne / to the end more deyn^ie
dysshes may ensue. If an other man give to the a deynti^ morsel / ^^rste pray
him to hold the e^cused / than tak^ it / but deu^de part to thy self / than
offer to him ^he remenaunt that gave it to the / or give part to him that
sytteth next the.

That gobbe^ that can na^ conuenyently be take with thy hand / take it on thy
tre^cher. If any man reach to the of a custarde or a pie any thing in a spone
/ either take it on thy trenchour / or take the spone offered / and the meat
laid on thy tre^cher / give him his spone again. If it be lyquide and thy^
^ha^ is give to the in the spon^ to ^aste / take the spone and r^ceyue the
meat / and wype the spone and deliver it agay^e^ To lycke thy ^yngers greacy /
or to dry them upon thy clothes / be both vnmane^ly / that must rather be
done upon the boorde clothe or thy napkyn. To swalowe thy mea^e hole down / is
the manner of s^orkes and devouring glut^ous.

If any thing be cut by an other / it is again m^ner to pu^ forth thy hand
or thy tren^hour before the ke^u^r offer it to the / lest thou should seem to
ca^che tha^ which was poi^ted for an other. That that is raught to the must
be ^ake with three fyngers / or with thy trenchour. If any thing be offered the
that agreth not with thy stomach / beware thou say not that Clytipho said / I
ca^ not away with it father: but gentylly say I thank you. This is a very
manerly manner of refusing. If he that offreth it the persevere / say it gree^h
not with thy stomach / or else thou wolte eat no more.

The manner of cuttynge of thy meat is to be learned from the ten^er years / not
peuysshe as some use / but manerly and con^enyent. The sholder must be cut
otherwise / and otherwise the leg / otherwise the neck piece / otherwise the
side / otherwise the capon / otherwise the fesante / o^herwyse the partriche /
otherwise the malard^ wherefore pertyculerly to speak of al were both per^use
and also not profit. This su^marily may be taught. It is the property of such
as be preparers or masters of ba^kettes / to engrosse from every side all that
may please the mouth. It is small honesty to give to an other that thou have
bytten of. It is al of the car^e to dyp or put thy breed again in to the
disshe of po^age that is gnawen upon. Likewise to take the meat^ out of thy
mouche that tho^ have ^hawed / and lay it on thy trenchour / is a leude
tutche. For if thou have take any morsel that can not go down / it is manner
to turn thy heed and cast it privily away. It is reproach to eat again the
meat that is gnawen or bones laid on thy trenchoure. Cast not under the
boorde bones or any other fragme^t defyling the flore / nor ^ast it on ye table
clothe / nor put it in the dysshe / but lay it on the cover of thy trenchour /
or in the voyde^ that is set for fragmentes.

It is noted a folly to give meat to strange dogs at the table: it is more
folly to handle dogs at the table.

To pyll thyn eggeshell with thy fyngers or thy ^hombe is a leude tutche: the
same is more leude to put thy tongue in to thegge. with thy knyfe to take it out
is more comely.

To gnawe bones is the property of dogs / to pycke i^ with thy knyfe is good
manner. To take sal^e out of the salt celler with three fyngers / in a vulgar
ieste is called the norter of carters or ploughmen. Salt must be take as is
necessary with thy knyfe. If the salt be far of it must be asked.

To lycke the dysshe wherein is sugar or any sweet meat / is the property of
cattes / and not of men.

Cut thy flesh small or mynce it v^on ^hy tre^cher / and after take breed
and ^haw it a reason before thou let it go down: and this not only is manerly
but helthfull.

Some rather devour than eat their meat / non other wise than such as be
led in to prison. This rauenyng and devouring is appropred to thieves.

Some cramme so much in to their mouth at ones / that both their chekes
stand out and swell like a pair of belowes. Some in eating slubber up their
mea^e like swyne. Some snuff and snurte in the nose for gredynesse as though
they were choked.

To drink or speak with bridelde or full mouth / is neither honesty nor
surety. Entrechaunge of comunycation by pausynge / does interrupte contynuall
eating.

Some without pause still eat and drink / not because they be an houngred and
thurstye / but because they can none otherwise order or behave them self / but
if they scratche their heed / or pycke their ^ethe / or show leude gesture with
their hands or their knyfe / or eis coughe / hemme / or spyt^e.

This manner come^h all of the carte / and has in a manner a resemblaunce of
madness. This tedyous manner must be avoided / in markynge the comunyca^ion of
other / if a man can se no opportunyte to speak. It is an yuell manner to sytte
in a study at the table.

Thou may se some in such an ecstasy or stony that they here not what is said
of other / nor perceive that they eat: and if thou call them by name / they
seem as men that came from sleep / their mind is so rauysshed.

It is no good manner with rollyng eyes to mark what every man eats / nor it
is not sitting to gase long upon any that sytteth at the ^able: also it is
worse manner to scoule or look awrie upon any that sy^ upon the same side. It is
worste fasshyo^ to wr^e his heed and look behind him what they do at an other
table.

To blabbe out what is said or done at large / when men drink and make merry /
becomes no man nor child.

A child sitting with his betters should never speak / but necessyte compel
/ or el^ he be bydden. At merry words let him somewhat smyle: at rybaudrie let
him show no light countenance / no^ roughe / if he tha^ speaks be a man of
hye auctorite / but let his countenance so ^empre his behauour / so that it
shall seem either tha^ he herd not / or understood not.

Silence becomes women / but rather children.

Some does answre before he that speaks hat^^ made an end / and it
chaunseth that he makes contrary answer / and is had in derysyon / and
this old proverb may be said of him: I asked for hooks / an other answered
saying he had no boots / answering nothing to purpose.

King Solomon sayth^ thus / he is a fool that answers before he hereth the
end: he hereth not that perceyueth not. If he understand not him that asks
/ let him cease until he that has spoke repete his tale. If he do not so /
but co^strayneth him to answer / let the child gentylly pray him of pardon
/ and desire him to show the thing again. And the questyon understand /
let him pause a little / after let him answer in few words and meryly.

At table nothing ought to be blabbed forth that should dimynisshe myrthe.

To hurt the fame of them that be absente is a great fault: nor no old sores
of any man should be renewed.

To find fault with any meat is against good manner / and is displeasure to
him that makes the feast.

If the feast be made of thy cost / like as it is manner to excuse the syngle
fare / so to praise the feast or to reherce what it cost / is sour sauce to
the gestes.

To conclude / if any thing be done of any man not manerly by ignorance / it
should be dissimuled rather than had in derisyon. Liberty is me^e at meat and
drink.

It is reproach as Flaccus says / to blow abroad if any thing ouerslyppe a
man at table vnaduyse^.

what so ever ^e do^ne or said there / should be lapped up in the clothe /
lest thou here this: I hate him that wol reherce that is said at table.

If the feast be longer than is mete for chyldhode / and seem superfluous / and
thou felest that thou have enough / either convey thy self privily thence /
or ask license.

They that keep chyldehode to hongerly / in my mind they be mad / and
likewise they that e^gorge them wi^h ouermoche meat. For as tha^ one does
enfeble the strength of the ^endre bodies / the other likewise oppresses ^he
w^^: But measure ought to be known.

The body of a child ou^h^ to be fed without full belly / and rather often a
little at ones.

Some knows not when they be full / but when the belly is swollen so that it
is in danger to b^eke / or else by vomy^e he must pycke over the perch.

They hate their children / that sytting at supper long unto late in the night
/ suffer them to sytte still by them.

Therefore if tho^ must ry^e fro long supper / take up thy trenchour with
fragme^tes / and salu^e him that seems the great^st man at the table / and
other likewise / and so dep^^te: but by and by return / lest thou be noted to
depart because of play or of other light cause.

Retournynge / wait if any thing lack / or honestly attend at the table /
and look if any man command any thing. If thou set down any thing or take
up / take heed thou sheade nothing upon other men's clothes. If thou s^uffe
the candle / first take it of the boorde / and either cover with duste the
snuff / or trede it under thy foot / lest some yuell savor be tedyous to
smell.

If thou reach forth any thing or pour be ware thou do i^ na^ wi^h the lift
hand.

C^^maunded to say grace / order well thy behauoure / showing the self ready
unto the company keep syle^ce / and time come to say.

In the mean time let thy countenance be stable / with r^uer^nce regarding
the g^ea^est man at the table.

Of metynge to gythers.
If any man mete the by the way worshyp^ull / either by reason of age / either
by relyg^on or dignyte / or otherwise worthy reverence / let a child
remember to go forth of the way and reverently put of his cappe / and somewhat
make curtesy with his knees. Let him not think thus / what have I to do with
an unknown man / what with him that never did for me? So reverence is not give
to man for his merytes / but to god. So god commands by Solomon / which
commands to rise up to an aged man: likewise by Paul / to show double
reverence to prees^es. To conclude / to show reverence to every person / to
whom reverence is due / following also the gentyles reverence. If so be that
the Turk (which god forbid) should have domynion upon us / we should offend
if we did not show reverence to that auctori^e. Of the father and mother I
speak not among other / to whom chief reverence after god is due. Like
reverence to our teachers / which likewise as they fresshen the minds of men
/ so they engendre good manner. And so among like of degree this saying of
Paul must take place / Prevent you one an other with due reverence. He that
preuenteth his egall or inferior with reverence / he is not therefore the worse
/ but more honest therefore and more to be had in reverence.

with our betters we must speak with reverence / and in few words: with our
peers louyngly and gentylly. And when a child speaks he must hold his
cappe in the right hand / and hold his lift hand toward his myddle / or
else that is more comely / hold his cappe with both hands joined / so that his
thombes apere covering his codpece. To hold his book or hat under his arm is
take as rudeness.

Let basshfulnes be showed / but as becomes / not as makes a child amated.
Let the eyes look upon him that thou speak to sadly and only / showing
nothing wanton nor leude.

To cast thine eyes down as a be called Catoblepas / is a suspectyon of an
yuell conscience. To look a^yde is token of disdain. To turn this ways and
that / is a syne of light wit. It is rudeness often to change countenance /
as now ^o wrie the nose / now to knytte the brows / now to set up the brows
/ now to set a wrie the mouth / now to gape wide / now to make a narowe
mouth: these be synes of inconstance.

It is also all of the carte to shake the heed and cast the busshe / to coughe
without cause / to hemme or rey^he / lykwise to scratche thy heed to pick
thine ears / to sny^ thy nose / to stryke thy face / as a man that wypeth for
^hamfastnesse / to scrubbe or rub thy ne^ke / to shrugge or wrigge thy
sholders as we se in many ytalyens.

To deny with touenynge away thy heed / or beckenyng with thy heed to call him
/ and to conclude / to speak by gesture and beckenynges as sometime becomes a
man / but not a child. It is no manner to wagge the arms / to play with the
fyngers / to stager with the fete / to speak hastily not with the tongue / but
mouynge all the body / which is the property of turtyll doue^ or wagtayles /
nor much different fro pyes ^hatterynge. Let thy voice be soft and still / not
hye and clamorous like carters / nor so bause that he to whom thou speak
may not here the^ Let thy speech not be hasty and over ron thy wit / but
soft and open.

This also auoydeth natural stu^tynge / buffyng / and stammerynge / though
not fully / yet for most party it demynis^heth / where as hastye speech
causes vice in many / that came not by nature. Also in co^munycacion it is a
gentle manner to repete some honest title or name of room or dignyte of him
that thou spekest to.

There is nothing more honest or plesaunt than the title or name of father or
mother / nothing more amyable thanne the name of brother and suster.

If that private names come not to mind / name all learned men worshypfull
masters / all priests and monks reverend fathers / all companyons /
bretherns and friends: breuely all that be unknown / call the^ master and
maystresse.

Of a childs mouth it is not honest to swear / whether it be gamyng or
ernest. what is more reproach than this manner in ^ome countries / to swear at
every third word / ye the little gyrles / by breed / by salt / by ca^dle: by
what thing swear they not? To foul words let no manerly child make answer
/ nor lay his ear. Finally if any thing be showed to the eyes / or herds by
the ears in honestly.

If the cause require that he must name any membre privy / let him cover it
with honest circumstaunce.

Further / if it chance to speak of vile things / as vomyte / a draught / or
a ^orde / he must say before save reverence.

If he must deny any thing / let him beware that he say^ not ye say not truth
/ specially if he speak to his elder^ but first by your favor say it was
otherwise told me of such a man.

A well manered child shall contend with no man / no not with his fellows /
but let other have their will: if the thing come to discencyon / let him
refer the matter to arbytrement. Let him not presume before an other / let him
not auaunte his own deeds / nor reprove the manner of other / nor reuyle the
nature and manners of any nacyon / nor publysshe an^ secret showed him / nor
scatter no new tales / nor defame no man / nor rebuke no honest man of that
which is natural / for that is not only spy^efull and ungentle / but
folysshe. As if a man call him that has but one eye / one eyed: him that
halteth a crypp^e: him that can not se bu^ nigh unto him sandblynde / or he that
is borne out of wedlock bastard. By this means it shall follow that a man
with out envy shall get praise / and allure s^endes.

To interrupt any man in his tale before it be ended^ is again manner.

Let him bear malice to no man: show gentylnesse to every person / let
him take few to his secret counsel / and those with good discrecion. Let
him not show that he would have secret. It is folly to look that an other man
shall keep close / that can not keep close to thy self. No man is so close of
tongue but he has some in trust / to whom he woll open his secret mind. It
is most sure nothing to do or say / whereof thou should be shamed if it be
spoken abroad.

Be not over besy in other men's causes. And if thou se or here any thing /
look thou know not that thou know.

To pry or look upon letters that be not brought to the / is leude manner. If a
man open his casket before the / go a part.

Also if thou perceive any secret counsel to rise among any persons /
avoid thence thy self as though thou knew no thing / and do not entremedle
to come to counsel except thou be called.

Of gaming and pla^.
In gaming and gentle sport let merry fasshyon be showed / let craft /
cause of strife and discey^e be set a part / also lies. For through these
pri^ciples a child grows to further inconuenyence. He ouercometh better that
s^ryueth not / than he that has the victory. Never repugne judgment. If thou
play with them that ^e ignorant^ / thou may always win / but be content
sometime to lose tha^ the gaming may be more merry. If thou play with mean^r
persons / take not upon the to be better than they. A man should gamen for
recreacion and not because of lucte. They say that the inclynacion of a child
can not be better known than in gaming. If any be disposed of nature to
deceytes / to lies / to stryues / to vyolence or presu^pcion / here the vice of
nature woll apere. Therefore a manerly chyld^ should be like him self / no
less in gaming than at the table.

Of the chamber.
In the chamber sylenc^ is laudable / with honesty. Loud speech and clattryng
is not honest / much more in bed. whether thou do thy clothes of or upon /
regard honesty / beware thou show nothing bare to sight that manner and
nature would have covered. If thou lie with a bedfelowe / lie still / and make
not bare thy self with tumblyng / nor vex not thy bedfelowe with pulling of
the clothes. Before thou lay thy body down / cross thy forheed and thy breast
with the syne of the holy cross / and commend the to Jesus Christ with some
little prayer.

Do the same in the morning wha^ thou rysest / begin the day with some prayer:
Thou canste not begin with better luck. And after thou haste be at the ^akes
do no thing unto thou hau^ washed thy hands and face / and thy mouth.

To such as chance to be well borne it is to the^ shame not to be of like
manners as their progenytours were. whom fortune wylleth to be of common sort
/ of low blood / and vplandysshe / they must labor the more to set them
self forth with auauncement of good manners / in that that fortune has
debarred them.

No man can chose to him self father and mother or his country / but
condycion wy^ / and manners any man may countrefet. I will annexe to this a
short prece^te as a sure testimonye / which seems to me worthy pr^emyne^ce.
It is the chief part of gentle manner / although thou never offend ^hy self
/ yet gentilly to pardon other men's fautes / nor to love less thy companyon
therefore / though he have some co^dycions out of frame. Nor these things be
not here spoken for that intent / as though no man may be honest without the^.
If so be thy companyon do offend by ouersyght / for as much as he seems of
some reputacyon / to aduer^yse him between the and him and with gentle
fasshyon / is good manner.

This small gift my son well beloved / I will it shall be given for thy sake
to all the company of children / that forth with through this reward both
thou shalt allure the good minds of thy fellows / and thou shall give to them
the desires of lyberall science and good manners. The goodness of Jesus vouche
safe thy noble and virtuous enclynacion / and to increase to better at all
times.

indiciu^ est: molliter erectum, decet. Ceruix nec in leuu^, nec in dextrum
uergat, by pocriticum enim, nisi colloquium, aut aliud ^imile postulet. Humeros
oportet aequo libramine temperare, non in morem antennarum, alterum attollere,
alteru^ deprimere. Nam huiusmodi gestus in pueris neglecti, uertutur in
naturam, and corporis habitum praeter natural deformant. Itaque qui prae
desidia collegerunt co^sui tudine^ inflecte^di corpus, sibi gibbu^ conciliant,
que^ natura non dederat: and qui de fl^xu^ in latus caput habere consueuerunt,
in eu^ habitum ind^rescu^t, ut adulti ^r^stra mutare nita^tur. Siquidem tenera
a corpus^ula plantu^is similia sunt, quae in qua^cunque s^eciem sur^a
^uniculoue de flexeris, ita cr^scunt and indurescu^t. Vtrumque ^rachiu^
interg^m retorquere, simul and pigritiae speciem habet, and furis. N^que multo
decentius est, altera manu in ilia iniecta astare ^edereue, quoth tamen quibusda^
elegans ac mili^are uidetur. At no^ statim honestum est quod stultis placuit,
sed quod naturae and rationi consentan^um est. Reliqua dicentur, quum ad
colloquiu^, and conuiuium uentum erit.

Membra quibus natura pudore^ addidit, retegere citra necessitate^, procul
abesse debet ab indole liberali. Quin ubi necessitas huc cogit, tamen id quoque
dece^te uerecu^dia faci^ndu^ est, etia^ si nemo testis adsit. Nunq enim non
adsu^t angeli, qbus in pueris gratissimus est pudicitiae comes custosque pudor.
Quoru^ au^t conspectu^ oculis subducere pudicu^ est, ea multo minus oportet
alieno praebere co^tactui. Lotiu^ remorari uae letudini perniciosu^, secreto

Deductis genubus sedere, aut di uaricatis tibijs distortisue stare T^asonu^

DE CVL^V.
In summa dictu^ est de corpore, nu^c de cultu paucis, e^ quod uestis
quoda^modo corporis corpus est, and ex hac quoque liceat habitu^ animi
co^ijcere. Quanq hic certus praescribi modus non potest, e^ quod non omniu^ per
est, uel fortuna, uel dignitas, nec apud omnes eade^ decora su^t, aut indecora,
postremo nec omnibus seculis eade^ place^t displicentue. Vnde quemadmodu^ in
alijs multis, ita hic quoque no^nihil tribuendu^ est, ^uxta prouerbium, (...),
atque etia^ (...), id est, legi, and regioni, and tempori, cui seruire iubent
sapie^tes. Est tamen in hisce uarietatibu^, quoth per se s^^ ^onestum, aut secus,
uelut illa quae nullu^ habe^t usu^, cui paratur uestis. Prolixas trahere caudas
in foeminis ridetur, in uiris improbatur. An Cardinales and episcopos deceat,
alijs aestimandu^ relinquo. Mulctitia nu^quam no^ probro da ta sunt tu^ uiris
tu^ foeminis, qua^doquide^ hic est alter uestis usus, ut ea tegat q impudice
ostendu^tur oculis hominu^. Olim habebatur parum uirile discinctu^ esse, nu^c
ide^ nemini uicio uertitur, quod indusijs, subuculis, et caligis repertis
tega^tur pude^da, etia^ ^i diffluat tunica. Alioqui uestis breuior q ut
inclinanti ^egat parts quibus, debetur bonos, nus q no^ inhonesta est
Dissecare ueste^ amentiu^ est, picturatis ac uersicoloribus uti, morionu^ est
ac simiorum. Ergo pro modo facultatum ac dignitatis, proque regione et more
adsit cultui mundicies, nec sordibus notabilis, necluxu^, nec lasoiuia^ aut
fastu^ prae se ferens. Neglectior cultus decet adolesce^tes, sed citra
immu^diciam. Indecore qda interularu^ ac tunicaru^ ora^ aspergine lotij

nariu^ and oris pituita. Sunt qbus uestis in alteru^ la tus defluit, alijs i^
tergu^ ad re nes usque, nec desunt qbus hoc uid^atur elegans. Vt ^otum corporis
habitu^ and mundu^, and compositu^ esse decet, ita decet illu^ corpori
co^gruere. Si quid ^lega^tioris cultus de dear pare^tes, nec teipsu^ re^lexis

amictus, alijs suam exprobrat miseriam, sibique conflat inuidiam.

DE MORIBVS in templo.
Quoties fores templi praeteris, nudato caput, ac modice flexis genibus, and ad
sacra uerso uultu, Christu^ diuosque salutato. Ide^ and alias faciendu^, slew
in urbe, sieve in agris, quoties occurrit imago crucis. Per aede^ sacra^ ne
tra^sieris, nisi simili religione saltem breui precatiuncula Chris^^^ appelles,
idque retecto capite, and utroque genu slexo^ Cu^ sacra peraguntur, totum
corporis habitu^ ad religione^ decet componere. Cogita illic praesentem
Christum cum innumeris angeloru^ milibus. ^t si qui regem homine^ alloquuturus
circu^sta^te proceru^ corona, nec caput aperiat, nec gen^ ^lectat, non ^^^ pro
rustico, sed pro insono ^aberet^^ ab oi^bus: quale est illic ^pertu^ habere
caput, erecta genua, ubi ad est rex ille regu^ immortalis, and immortalitatis
largitor, ubi uenerabundi circu^stant aetherei spiritus? Nec refert, sleos non
^ides, uident illi te, n^c minus certu^ est illos adesse, q si uide res eos
oculis corporeis. Certius enim cernunt oculi fidei q oculi carnis. Indecentius
^tiam est quod quida^ in templis obambulant, and Peripa^^cicos agunt. Atqui
deambulationibus porticus and fora conueniunt, non templa, quae sacris
concionibus, mysterijs, ac deprecatio^i dicata su^^. At co^cionante^ spectent
oculi, huc attentae sint aures, ^uc inhiet animus omni cum reuere^tia, quasi
non homine^ ^udias, sed deu^ per os hominis tibi loquente^. Quu^ recitatur
Euangeliu^, assurge, and si potes ausculta religiose. Quum in symbolo cani^ur,
and homo factus est, in genua procu^be, uel hoc pacto te submitte^s in illius
honore^, qui semet pro tua salute, quu^ esset supra omnes coelos demisit in
terras, quu^ esset deus, dignatus est homo fieri, ut te faceret deu^. Dum
peragu^tur mysteria, toto corpore ad religione^ composito, ad altar uersa sit
facies, ad Christum animus. Altero genu t^rram contingere, erecto altero, cui
laeuus i^nitatur cubitus, gestus est impioru^ militu^, q domino Jesus illude^tes
dicebant, Au^ rex Iudeoru^. ^u dimitte u^ru^que, reliquo etia^ corpore no^
^ihil inflexo ad ueneratione^. Reliquo te^pore aut legatur aliquid e libello,
five precularu^, s^^e doctrinae salutaris, aut men's celeste qdpiam meditetur.
Eo tpe nugas abg^nire ad aure^ uicini, eoru^ est, q no^ credu^t illic adesse
Christu^, huc illuc circumferre uagos oculos, amentiu^ est. Existimate frustra
templum adisse, nisi inde melior discesse^^is puriorque.

De conuiuijs.
In co^uiuijs adsit ^ilaritas, absit petulantia^ non nisi lotus accumbe, sed
ante praefectis unguibus ne quoth in his haereat sordium, dicarisque (...), ide^
sordidus and impendio parcus, uide proverb. ac prius clam reddito lotio, aut si
res ita postulet, exonerata etiam aluo: and si forte^ strictius cinctum esse
contingat, aliquantulum relaxare uincula consultum est, quoth in accubitu paru^
decore fi^t. Absterge^s manus, simul abijce qcqd ai^ o aegre est. Na^ i^
co^uiuio nec triste^ esse decet nec co^tristare qu^^q, iussus co^secrare
me^sa^, uultu^ ac manus ad religione^ co^poni^o, specta^s aut co^uiuij
primariu^, aut s^ fors adest, imagine^ chri^ti, ad nomen Jesus matrisque
uirginis, utrumque ^lecten; genu. Hoc muneris si cui alteri delegatu^ fuerit,
pari religione tu^ auscultato, tu^ respo^deto. Sedis honorem alteri liben^er
cede, and ad honoratio^e^ locu^ inuitatus, comiter excusa: si tamen id crebro
s^rioque iubeat aliqs authoritate praeditus, uerecu^de obte^pera, ne uideare
pro civilly praefractus. Accu^bens utra^que manum super mensam habe, non
coniu^ctim, nec in quadra. Qu^dam enim indecore, uel una^, ^el ambas ^abent in
gremio. Cubito uel utroque uel altero in^iti mens^e, senio morb^ue lassis
co^donatur: idem in delicatis quibusda^ aulicis, qui se decere putant quicquid
agu^t, dissimulandum est, non imitandu^, interca cauendum, ne proxime
accumbe^ti pedibus sis molestus. In ^ella uacillare, and nunc huic nunc alteri
nati insidere, specie^ habet subinde ue^tris ^tatu^ emittentis, aut emittere
conatis. Corpus igitur aequo libramine sit erectum. Mantile si datur aut ^umero
sinistro, aut brachio laeuo imponito. Cu^ honoratioribus accubitu^us, capite
pexo, pil eu^ relinquito, nisi uel regionis mos diuersu^ suadeat, uel alicuius
authoritas praecipiat, cui no^ parere sit indecorum. Apud quasda^ nationes mos
est, ut p^eri stantes, ad maiora^ me^^a^ capia^t cibu^ extremo loco, re^ecto
capite. Ib^ ne puer accedat, nisi iussus, ne haereat usque ad co^uiuij ^ine^,
sed sumpto quod satis est, sublata quadra sua, flexo poplite, salutet conuiuas,
praecipue qui inter co^uiuas est caeteris honoratior. A dextris sit poculum et
cultellus escarius, rite purgatus: ad laeuam pa^^s. Panem una uola pressu^,
summis digitis refringere, quorunda^ auricoru^ delitias esse sinito, tu
cultello seca decenter, non undique reuellens cru^tum, aut utrinque reseca^s:
delicatoru^ hoc est. Panem uete res in omnibus conuiuijs c^^rem sacra^
religiose tractabant, unde nu^c quoque mos relictus est, cu^ forte delapsu^ in
humu^, exosculari. Co^uiuium stati^ a poculis auspicari, potoru^ est, qui
bibu^t non quod si^^e^t, sed quoth solea^t. Nec ea res solu^ moribus est i^
honesta ueru^ etia^ officit corporis ua^etudini. Nec statim post su^per tam ex
iure ofsam bibendu^, multo minus post lactus esu^. Puero saepius q bis, aut ad
su^ mum t^r, in conuiuio bibere, nec decoru^ est, nec salubre. Semel bibat
aliquandiu pastus de secu^do missu, praesertim sicco: dein sub conuiuij finem,
idque modice sorbendo, non ingurgita^do, nec equoru^ sonitu. Tum ^^nu^, tum
ceruis^a nihil ominus quam uinu^ inebrians, ut pu^roru^ ualetudine^ lae^it, ita
mores dedecorat. Aqua feruidae co^uenit aetati, aut si non patitur, siu^
regionis qualitas, siu^ alia quae ^ia^ causa, tenui cer^^sia utitor, aut ui^o
nec ardenti, and aqua diluto. Alioqui m^ro gaudent^s haec sequuntur praemia:
d^ntes rubiginosi, g^nae defluentes, oculi luscios^, mentis stupor, breuiter
seniu^ ante senecta^. Antequam bibas, praemande cibu^: nec labra admou^as
poculo, nisi prius mantili aut ^inteolo abstersa: praesertim s^ quis suu^
poculum tibi porrigit, aut ubi de co^mum bibitur poculo. Inter bibendu^
intueri, illiberal^ ^st, quemadmodu^ and ciconiarum exe^plo ceruice^ in tergum
r^flectere, ne quid herea^i^ imo cyat^o, parum est liberale. Saluta^te^ poculo
resalutet comiter, and admotis labris cyatho paululum libans bibere si ^^mulet:
hoc ciui^^ nugoni sa^is erit. Qui si rusticus urgeat, polliceatur se tum
responsurum, quum adol^uer^t. Quidam ubi uix been co^sederit, mox manus in
epulas conijciunt. Id luporum est, aut eorum, qui de chytropode carnes nondum
immolatas deuorant, iuxta prouerbium. Primus ^ibum appositu^ ne at tingito, non
tantu^ ob id quod arguit auidu^, sed quod inter dum cu^ periculo co^iunctum
est, du^ qui feruidu^ inexploratu^ recipit in os, aut expuere cogitur, aut si
deglutiat adur^re guld, utroque ridiculus aeque ac miser. Aliquantisper
morandu^, ut puer assuescat affectui temperare. Quo co^silio Socrates ne senex
quidem unquam de primo cratere bibere sustinuit. Si cum maioribus accumbit
puer, postremus, n^c id nisi ^ui^atus manu^ admoueat patine. Digitos in
iuscule^ta immergere agrestiu^ est, sed cu^^tello fuscinaue tollat quod uult:
nec id ex toto eligat disco, quoth sole^t liguritores, sed quod forte ante ipsu^
iacet sumat, quod uel ex Homero discere licet, apud que^ creb^r est hic
uersiculus: (...), Id quoque si fuerit insigniter elegans, alteri cedat, and
quod proximu^ est accipiat. Vt igitur in tempera^tis est in oe^s patinae plagas
manu^ mittere, ita paeru^ decoru^, patina^ inuertere, quo ueniant ad te
lautiora. Si quis alius cibum ^orrexerit elegantiore^, praefatus
excusatiunculam recipiat, sed resecta ^ibi portiuncula, reliquu^ offe^at ei qui
porrexerat, aut proxime asside^ti co^municet. Quod digitis excipi non potest,
quadra excipiendu^ est. Si quis e placenta, uel artocrea porrexerit aliquid
cocleari, aut quadra excipe, aut cocleare porrectu^ accipe, and inuerso in
quadram cibo, cocleare reddito. Si liquidius est quod datur gusta^du^, sumito,
and cocleare reddito, sed ad mantile extersu^. Digitos unctos uel ore
praelingere, uel ad tunicam aex^ergere, pariter in civil est: id mappa potius
aut mantili faciendu^. Integros bolos subito deglutire, ciconiaru^ est, ac
balatronu^. Si quoth ab alio fuerit resectum, inciuile est manu^ quadr^ue
po^rigere, prius q ille structor offerat, ne uidea^e precipere quoth alteri
paratu^ e^at^ Q^od por^igitur, aut tri^us digitis, aut porrecta quadra
excipie^^^^ Si quoth offertur no^ co^gruit tuo stomacho, cave ne dixeris illud
Comici Clitip^onis. No^ possu^ pater, sed blande agito gratias. Est enim hoc
urbanissimu^ recusandi genus. Si prestat inuitator, uerecunde dicito, aut non
co^uenire tibi, aut te nihil amplius requirere. Discenda est ^ primis statim
annis seca^di ratio, no^ sup^titiosa, quoth quida^ faciu^t, ^ed ciuilis and
co^moda. Aliter enim insciditur armus, aliter coxa, aliter c^ruix, aliter
cratis, aliter capus, aliter phasianus, aliter p^rdix, aliter anas, quadere
singulatim praecipere, ut prolixu^ sit, ita nec operae preciu^. Illud i^
uniuersu^ tradi po^t. Apitiorum esse omni ex part, qdqd palato bla^^itur,
abradere. Abs te semesca alteri porrigere, paru^ hon^sti moris est. Pane^
praerosu^ iteru^ in ius immerge re rusticanu^ est. Sicut and cibu^ mansu^
faucibus eximere, and in quadra^ reponere i^ elega^s est. Na^ si quoth forte
suptu^ est quoth deglutiri no^ expedit, ^la^ auersus aliquo proijciat. Cibu^
ambesu^ aut ossa semel i^ quadra^ seposita repetere, uicio datur. Ossa aut si
quoth simile reliquu^ est, ne sub me^sa^ ab ^eceris pauime^tu^ co^spurca^s, ^ec in
me^sae str^gula^ proijce, nec in patina^ repone, sed in quadrae angulu^ sepone,
aut in discu^ q apud no^ nullos reliquijs excipie^dis apponitur. Canibus
alienis de me^sa pro rigere cibu^, ineptiae tribuitur, ineptius est illo^ in
conuiuio co^trectare. Qui putamen di gitoru^ unguibus aut pollice repurgare
ridiculu^ est: idem inserta lingua facere magis etiam ridiculu^, cultello id
sit decentius. Ossa de^tibus arrod^re caninum est, cultello purgare civil.
Tres digiti sa lino impressi, uulgari ^oco dicitur agrestiu^ insignia. Cul
tello sumendu^ est salis quantu^ satis est. Si longius abest saliuu^, porrecta
quadra petendum est. Quadram au^t patinam cui saccarum aut aliud suaue quiddam
adhesit, lingua lambere, feliu^ est non hominum. Carnem prius minutim in quadra
dissecet, mox addito pane ^imul aliqua^diu mandat, priusquam ^raijciat in
stomacu^. Id non solu^ ad bonos mo^es, uerum etia^ ad bonam ualetudinem
pertinet. Quida^ deuora^t uerius quam edunt, non aliter qua^ mox, ut aiu^t,
abducendi in carcerem. Latronu^ est ea tuburcinatio. Quida^ ta^tum simul in os
ingeru^t, ut utrinque ceu folles tumea^t buccae, alij mande^do diductu labiorum
sonitu^ edunt procoru^ in morem. No^nulli uora^di studio, spirant etiam
naribus, quasi praefocandi. Ore pleno uel bibere, uel loqui, nec honestu^ est,
nec tutu^. Vicissitudo fabularum interuallis dirimat perpetuu^ esum. Quidam
citra intermissionem edunt bibuntue, non quod esuriant sitiantue, sed quod
alioqui gestus moderari non possunt, nis^ aut scabant caput, ^ut sca^pant
dentes, aut ge^ticule^ter manibus, aut ludat cultello, aut tussie^t, aut
screent, aut expua^t. Ea res a ru^tico pudore profecta, nonnullam insaniae
specie^ habet. Auscultandis alioru^ sermonibus fallendu^ est hoc tedij, si no^
datur opportunitas loquendi. Inciuile est, cogitabundu^ in mensa accumbere.
Quosdam aute^ uideas adeo stupentes, ut nec audiant quoth ab alijs dicatur, nec se

intentos ^abere oculos: inurbanius e^^am transuersim hirquis intueri, qui in
codem accumbunt latere: inurbanissimum, retorto intergum capite co^templari,
quid rerum geratur in altera mensa. Effutire si quid liberius inter pocula
dictum factumue sit, nulli decoru^ est, nedum puero. Puer cum natu maioribus
accumbens nunquam loquatur, nisi aut coga^ necessitas, aut abs quopiam
inuitetur. Lepide dictis modice arrideat: obcoene dictis ne quando arrideat,
sed nec frontem contrahat si praecellit dignitate qui dixit, sed ita uultus

Mulieres ornat silentium, sed magis pueritiam. Quidam responde^t, pr^usquam

intelligens negabat se habere scaphas, respondens quod nihil ad rem atti^eret.
Vide prouerbi. Docet ^oc Rex ille sapientissimus, stultitiae tribuens,

interponat morae, deinde tum pau ^is respondeat, tum iucunde. In co^uiuio nihil
effutiendu^, quod offuscet hilaritatem. Absentiu^ famam ibi laedere, plac^lu^

Quidam se saturos nesciu^t, nisi dum ita distentus est uentriculus, ut in

De congressibus.
Si quis occurrerit i^ ^^a, uel senio uenera^dus, uel religio^e reuere^dus, uel

quid mihi cu^ ignoto, quid cu^ nihil unq been de me merito? Non hic honos
tribuitur homini, no^ meritis, sed deo. Sic deus iussit per Solomone^, qui
iussis assurgere cano, si per Paulu^ q presbyteris duplicatu^ honore^ precipit

spectent eum cui loqueris, sed placidi simplicesque, nihil procax improbu^ue
pre se ferentes. Oculos in terra^ deijcere, quod faciunt catoblepae, male
conscientiae suspitione^ habet. Transuers^m tueri, uidetur auersantis. Vultu^
huc illuc ^oluere, leuitatis argumentu^ est. Indecoru^ est interim uultum in
uarios mutare habitus, ut nu^c corrugetur nasus, nu^c co^trabatur frons, nunc
attollatur superciliu^ nu^c distorqueantur labra, nu^c diducatur os, nu^c
prematur, haec ai^um arguu^t Proteisimile^. Indecoru^ and illud, concusso
capite iactare coma^, sine causa tussire screare, que^ admodu^ and manu scabere
caput, scalpere aureis, emu^gere nasu^, demul cere faciem, quoth est u^luti
pudore^ abstergenti^, suffricare occipilu^, humeros adducere, quoth in no^nullis
uidemus ^^alis. Rotato capite negare, aut reducto accersere, and ne per sequar
oi^a, gestibus ae^ n^tibus loqui, ut uiru^ interdum deccat, pueru^ minus dicet.
Illiberale est iactare brachia gesticulari digitis, uacillare pedibus, breuiter
non lingua, ^ed toto corpore loq, quoth turturu^ esse fertur, aut motacillaru^,
nec multu^ abhorre^s a picaru^ moribu^. Vox sit mollis ac sedata, no^ clamosa,
quoth est agricolaru^, nec ta^ pressa, ut ad aures eius cuiloqueris no^ perueniat.
Sermo sit non praeceps, and me^te^ praecurre^s, sed lentus and explanatus. Hoc
etia^ natural batarismu^, aut haesitantia^, si no^ in totu^ tollit, certe
magna exparte mitigat, quu^ praecipitatus sermo mul^is uitiu^ co^ciliet, quoth no^
dederat natura. Inter colloque^du^ subi^de titulu^ ^onorificu^ eius que^
appellas repetere ciuilitatis est. Patris ac matris uocabulo nihil
honorifice^tius, nihil dul^lus. Fratris sororisue no^e, nihil amabilius. Si te
fugiunt tituli peculiares, oe^s cruditi su^t tibi, praeceptores obserua^di,
oe^s sacerdotes, ac monachi, reuerendi patres, omnes aequales, fratres and a
mici, breuiter o^^s ignoti dn^i, ignote dn^ae. Ex ore pueri turpiter auditur
iusiurandu^, sieve iocus sit, sieve res seria. Quid enim turp^us eo more, quo apd
nationes quasda^ ad tertiu^ quodque uerbu^ deierant etia^ puellae, per pane^,
per uinu^, per candela^, per quid no^? Obscoenis dictis, nec lingua^ praebeat
ingenus puer, nec aures acco^modet. Denique quicqd in honest nudatur oculis
hoi^m indece^ter ingeritur auribus. Sires exigat, ut aliquod me^, bru^ pudendu^
nominetur, circu^^tione u^recu^da re^ notet. Rursus si quid inciderit, quoth
auditori nausea^ ciere possit, u^lut si quis narret uomitu^, aut latrina^, aut
oletu^, praefetur honore^ auribus. Si quid refellendum erit, cave dicat: haud
uera praedicas, praeserti^ ^i loquatur gra^diori natu, sed praefatus pace^,
dicat: m^bi secus narratu^ est a tali. Puer ingenuus cum nemine co^tentione^
suscipiat, ne cum aequalibus quidem, sed cedat potius uictoria^, si res
adiurgiu^ ueniat, aut arbitru^ prouocet. Ne cui se praeferat, ne sua iactet, ne
cuiusq i^stitutu^ reprehendat, aut ullius nationis ingenium mores ue ^uggillet,
ne quoth arcani creditu^ euulget, ne nouos spargat rumores, ne cuius obtrectet
famae, ne cui probro det uitiu^ natura insitu^. Id enim non solu^ co^tumeliosu^
est and inhumanu^, sed etiam stultu^. Veluti si quis luscu^ appellet luscu^,
aut loripede^ loripede^, aut strabu^ strabu^, aut nothu^ nothu^. His rationibus
f^et, ut sine inuidia laude^ inueniat, and amicos paret. Interpellare loquente^
anteq fabulam absoluerit, inurbanum est.

Cu^ nemine s^multate^ suscipiat: comitate^ exhibeat oi^bus per paucos tame^
interiore^ familiaritate^ recipiat, eosque cu^ de lectu. Ne cui tame^ credat quoth
tacitu^ uelit. Ridiculum enim est, ab alio silentij fide^ expectare, qua^ ipse
tibi non praestes. Nullus au^t est adeo linguae contine^tis, ut no^ ^abeat
alique^, in que^ trans^u^dat arcanu^. Tutissimu^ au^t est nihil admittere,
cuius te pudeat si proferatur. Alienaru^ r^rum ne fueris curiosus, and si quoth
forte co^sp^xeris, audieris u^ fac quod scis nescias. Literas tibi non oblatas
limis intueri, paru^ civil est. Si ^ors te praesente scriniu^ suu^ aperit
aliqs, subducito te. Na^ inurbanum est inspicere: contrectare aliqd in^rbanius.
Item si senseris inter aliquos secretius oriri colloquium, submoue te
dissimulanter, and in huiusmodi colloquium ne ^emet ingeras no^ accitus.

DE LVSV.
In lusibus liberalibus adsi^ alacritas, absit puicacia rixarum parens, absit
dolus, ac mendaciu^. Na^ ab his rudime^tis prosicitur ad maiores in^urias.
Pulchrius uincit q c^dit co^tentioni, q qui palmam obtinet. Arbitris ne
reclamita. Si cu^ impitoribus certame^ est, possisque semper uincere, no^nunq
te uinci patere, quo ludus sit alacrior. Si cum inferioribus luditur, ibi te
superiore^ esse nescias. Animi causa ludendu^ est non lucri gratia. Aiu^t
pueroru^ indole^ nusq magis apparere, q inlu su. Si cui ad dolos, ad me^daciu^,
ad rixa^, ad uioletia^, ad arrogantiam propensius ingenium, hic emicat naturae
uicium. Proinde puer ingenuus non minus in ludo, q in conuiuio sui s^milis sit.

De cubiculo.
In cubiculo laudatur sile^^iu^ and uerecu^dia. Certe clamor and garrulitas
indecora est, multo magis in lecto. Sieve cu^ exuis te, sieve cu^ surgis, memor
uerecundiae: cave ne quid nudes alioru^ oculis, quoth mos and natura tectu^ esse
uoluit. Si cu^ sodali lectum habeas co^mune^, quietus iaceto, neque corporis
iactatione, uel t^ipsu^ nudes, uel sodali detractis palijs si^ molestus. Priusq
reclines corpus in ceruical, fronte^ and pectus signa crucis imaginae, breui
precatiu^cula temet Christo co^mendans. Ide^ facito quum mane primu^ temet
^rigis, a precatiuncula die^ auspicans: Non ^ni^ potes ab omine feliciore.
Simul ac exoneraueris aluu^, ne quid agas, nisi prius lota facie manibusque,
and ore proluto. Quibus contingit been nasci, his turpe est generi suo non
respo^dere moribus. Quos fortuna uoluit esse plebeios, humiles, aut etiam
rurestres, his impe^sius etiam adnitendu^ est, ut quoth sors inuidit, moru^
elega^tia pense^t. Nemo sibi pare^tes, aut patriam eligere potest: at ingenium,
moresque sibi quisque potest fingere. Colophonis uice adda^ praecepciu^cula^,
quae mi^i uidetur propemodu^ primo digna loco. Maxima ciuilitatis pars est quu^
nusq delin quas, aliorum delictis facile ignoscere: nec ideo sodalem minus
habere charu^, si quos habet mores inconditior^s. Su^t enim qui moru^
ruditate^, alijs co^pense^t dotibus. N^que haec ita praecipiu^tur, quasi sine
his nemo bonus esse possit. Qoud s^ sodalis per inscitia^ peccet, in eo sane quoth
alicuius uidetur momenti, solu^ ac ^la^de monere ciuilitatis est.

Hoc quicquid est muneris ^ili chariss. uniuerso pueroru^ sodalitio per te
donatu^ esse uolui, quo statim hoc co^giario, simul and co^militonu^ tuorum
animos tibi co^cilies, and illis liberaliu^ artiu^, ac moru^ studia co^mendes.
Praeclaram indole^tuam Jesus benignitas seruare dignetur, seperque in melius
proue^ere. Datu^ apud ^riburg. Brisgoiae, Me^se Mar. An. M.D.XXX.
