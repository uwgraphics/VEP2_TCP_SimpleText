Articles presented to the King by the Deputies of the reformed Churches of the
country of Languedoc, and other places adjoining. With the Kings answer.
SIR,
we the Vicounts, Barons, Gentlemen, and other here under written, making
profession of the reformed Religion, both in our own name particularly and of
our adherents, and also as persons deputed by the reformed Churches of the
countries of Guyenne, Viuaraiz, Giuaudan, the Seneshalsee of Tholouze,
Auuergne, Rouergue, hie and base March, Quercy, Perigord, Limosin, Agennois,
Armaignac, Commanges, Conserans, Bigorre, Albi and Foys, Lauragais, Albigeois,
the countries of Castres, Villelongue, Mirepoix, Carcassois, and other
Provinces adjoining, assembled by the permission and under the safe conductes
of my Lord the King of Polonia your Mastiesties brother, in the town of
Montauban: Having perused sundry letters missiue of your Majesty concerning
declaration of your good intention and will to reestablishe and maintain a
good and firm peace in this Realm, to perform the parts of your Royal
office to al your subjects, and namely to those of the Religion, whom your
Majesty wills and means from henceforth to enbrace and entreat with all
favor, protection, and in the right of true and natural subjects, and to take
order by way of justice for the request that by them shall be made and presented
most humbly to your Majesty, touching all the particulars that to the^ shall
seem to be requisite and necessary for the maintaining of a true and sincere
peace: We protest to this effect, and with all our heart make most humble
petition of that which follows, under the instant and often repeted promises of
my Lord your Brother the King of Polonia.

First we protest before God and his Angels, that it never entered into our
hearts, before these last troubles, nor since, to take away nor withdraw from
your Majesty our duties of most humble, most obedient, and faithful
subjection: But with true and firm loyalty of subjects we have always
acknowledged and do acknowledge, that it is our vocation and natural estate by
the ordinance of God, to yield to your majesty all things due by a faithful
subject to his King and sovereign Lord.

If that your Majesty have taken in evil part and in displeasure that which by
us has been done, protested, and executed, since the month of August 1572
until this present: we most humbly beseech you to call to mind your letters of
declaration dated the xxiiii. day of the said month, and to have in your most
wise consideration the most just occasions yt have by force and constraynt
compelled us to take weapon in hand, with all other things requisite to a just
and necessary defense: to turn your eyes to the poor decessed persons
slaughtered and cruely put to death in sondrie towns and places of your
realm, under the pretense of a conspiracy, but truly in hatred of the
reformed religion: and that it will please you in pity to look upon the small
remna^t escaped out of ye said slaughters, with a true remorse and compassion of
a father of your country: to enter into your self and deeply and intentiuely
to behold yt benefit that your Majesty receives of the singular and
wonderful goodness of God: and there upon to meruell with us as well of our
preservation, as of this ouerture of peace in your realm, like as a good
Father would do in his house, when after that he has beholden in his house
some of his natural children murdered before his face, and his whole family
in manifest danger of utter ruin, he does at length see by the grace of god
all the rest of his children and his house restored to a good peaceable and
sure estate.

If it shall be by any man thought evil and unmeet for the greatness of your
royal estate, to make open declaration and protestation of such a grief,
surely (under the favor and ^orrection of such as so thinks) so ^o think
should be to do so much ye more wrong, first to God, and after ^o your own
conscience, to your ho^or and suertie, and to your justice and office royal,
and to throw upon ^oure subjects professing the religion as well those that be
murdered as these that be left alive, an everlasting infamy joined with
reproach of a pretenced conspiracy and rebellion, whereunto, next after the
service of God we ought to have regard above al other things that be nedeful
for us, for by such mean, also should in plain terms and openly be justified
as well the authors as executers of those murders, which should be to us
reproachful and impossible to be dissemblingly passed over.

And therefore, for the first article of our request, we holding us to your
Letter of the 24. of August, do most humbly beseech your Majesty, that
following the course that was begone upon the hurt of the late Count de Coligny
Admiral of France, it will please you according to the purport of your said
Letter, to do exemplar^ justice upon the said murders, by unsuspected Judges
thereto specially appointed, of like and equal number of both religions, and
namely other then those of the courts of Parliamentes and Presidencies of
Paris, Tholouze, Bordeaux, Rouen, Orleans, and Lion, in which the principal
presidents and councellers are reputed to have been the favorers approuers and
practisers of ye said slaughters, at least of those that have been committed
within their towns, yea and within your prisons, and at open assemblies: and
with as great speed as may be, to depute and apoynt the said Judges in all
places where it shall be nedfull, enioyning them upon a great pain to proceed
therein spedely, diligenly and uprightly, without maintenance, without parciall
wynking and desembling of Justice: for so shall your Majesty begin to pull out
of the hearts of your subjects that be of the religion, the just and great
distruste that they have conceived by seeing themselves given up and abandoned
to the cruelty of murderers, and so shall they the more spedely take to them
selves occasion to trust in your only word and promise.

Also it may please your Majesty to remember that in certain your Letters of
instructions and declarations, sent to the gouerners and your Liefenantes of
your provinces, in ye months of September, October, and December, there is
specially reserved the punishment of those that shall be found charged with the
supposed conspiracy against the persons of you and yours, and with
intellygences, practices and conducting of matters done during the last peace,
which thing might be a cause that under this false pretense of reseruacion, we
or some of us might be here after touched enquired upon and molested in this
realm iudicially or otherwise: And to mete with such captious dealinges and
oppressions, it may please your majesty by express words to revoke the said
reservation, and declare that your majesty holds and always reputeth us for
good and faithful subjects innocent and gyltlesse of al conspiracy and
rebellion, with inhibition to your aduocats and atourneys gennerall, their
substitutes and all other for ever, to make thereupon any pursuit process
mention or reproach.

That ye same declaration be made of the said Lord Admiral, ye County dela
Roche-foucaut, the Ladies de Briquemaut and Cauaignes, and the others that were
murdered condemned and put to death for the said supposed conspiracy. And
that all arestes and Judgments given, and all procedinges had or passed under
that pretense, against those ot the religion, be reuersed, adnulled, and
declared to be of no effect and value, and to have been given upon false and
sclanderous information, and that the persons decessed shall be restored to their
good renounes, and their heirs to their goods and rights of inheritance: And
that their children which for hatred to their fathers are imprisoned, or put or
holden in any other distress, be spedely delivered, and restored to their
former honor and liberty into the hands of their next friends. And to ordeyne
that those to whom their estates, dignities, charges, and offices, subject to
ye finances have been given, shall be bound to pay the finance to the said
heirs as shall be awarded by two of the kindred or friends known, and
nevertheless that their goods and money taken shall be restored them, and ye
withholders constrained there unto by all ways of justice.

That likewise al declarations, ordinances, and rules made against those of
the Religion since the xxiiii. of August last past, be reuersed, revoked and
declared of no effect and value.

And to extinguish the memory of the said judgments and arrestes and the
execution of them, that likewise the said declarations, ordinances, and rules
be rased and withdrawn out of all registers of Courts as well sovereign as
inferior, and that the same judgments, arrestes, and executions, declarations,
ordinances, and rules be taken away, cancelled and defaced: That also all
momuments, marks, and tokens of the said executions be destroyed, together
with the Books and infamous acts against the personages, memory and
posterity of the said persons deceased and executed, and that namely and
specially shall be defaced suppressed and (as much as shall be requisite) there
shall be prohibited all proceedinges, general and ordinary, as well by arrest of
the Parliament of Paris, in memory of the said slaughters, as by an other
arrest of Tholouze, reuersed by arrest of you privy counsel touching the
taking of the town house in the said first troubles, and that all be done in
the presence of four special persons, whereof two shall be of the Religion,
having continued in the same during the troubles. And ye record examplified
word by word of ye proceeding herein shall be expedited and delivered to those
which shall have express charge of procuration for that intent.

That it be declared that those of the Religion, have justly and upon good
occasion taken arms, withdrawn them selves and made war in these last
troubles, as being thereto constrained by violence done, where with they have been
terrified and put in fear.

And forasmuch as by the hearing of the word, and by Ecclesiastical discipline
your subjects are the better bolden in duty of their subjection, first toward
God, and next to your Majesty, and to their other superiors whom it has
pleased you to appoint over them, they most humbly and with most entire
affection beseech your Majesty in this behalf to extend to them ye most of
your favor, and therein to ordeine that of your grant and perpetual benefit,
the exercise of their Religion, and Ecclesiastical Discipline, and namely of
their Synodes, conferences, and co^sistories Ecclesiastical be freely
permitted to the^ for ever, and in all parts of this Realm, as well publicly,
as privately, comprising therein by special name the liberty of honest and
seemly burial without difference of time, in the same common Church-yardes,
about which matter many of the Catholics have oftentimes stirred up great
riots and debates in the towns where the said exercise was not permitted. And
that al exemptions from the exercise of the said Religion, limited in ye
towns and places as well of the Queen your Majesty's honorable mother, as of
my Lord the King of Polonia your Majesty's Brother, and other within your
dominion, be revoked and declared from henceforth of no effect.

And to prevent all suspiscions yt oftentimes heretofore have been raised
touching the collectio^s made and levied among those of the religion for the
charges and maintenance of the ecclesiastical ministry. It may please your
majesty from henceforth to exempt those of the religion from the payment of
tithes in those places where the said exercise shall be, for as much as the
tithes of their own nature are appointed for the said ministry.

That none of the religion shall be sommoned or constrained by your officers,
universities, colleges and Comunalties, to any ceremony and contribution
contrary to the said religion, and that so much as the case shall require there
be express prohibicion in your courts and universities in any wise to exact
of them atteyning to any office and degree, the oaths accustomed in the church
of Rome contrary to their said religion.

That all ye houses rents and revenues of colleges and schools appointed for
the instruction of youth shall be accounted and holden as ordained for ever for
your subjects yt will be there received, without making difference of religion,
neither as touching the Rector or Regent, nor for the Scholars and officers,
consultes of towns and places: where the said scholars and Colleges shall be
bound to receive rectors, and regents of both religions, for ye satisfaction
and instruction of both sorts without fraud or parcialitie.

That the marriages of Priests and Ecclesiastical persons that now be or
hereafter shall be of the said Religion, be declared lawful, and likewise their
children issuing of their marriage for their inheritance and other rights of
lawful legitimation: And that as well the father as the children be declared
capable of public offices estates and administrations.

That the deciding of marriages, that is to say, whether they be lawful and
perfect or no, shall be from henceforth determined by the consistories and others
of the religion, or at least by their superior Judge of your Justice being a
man of the same Religion.

That the gardians of Orphans whose father was of the Religion shall be bound to
cause them to be instructed and taught in the Religion of their Fathers, at the
least until their age of discretion, like as your Majesty has at other time
heretofore ordained.

That the same benefit of the exercise of the Religion be accorded and ordained
to the inhabitants and dwellers that be of the Religion in the County of
Venisse, and the Archbishopricke of Auignon: And that it please your Majesty
to do so much with the King of Navarre, that all things may abide in Navarre
and Bearne in the same estate as the late Queen of Navarre his mother left
them at the time of her deceasse: and also to treat so with the Pope and
Archbishop of Auignon that your grant and good pleasure in this behalf may be
confirmed and approved in due form, specially for the restitution and full
recompense of the goods of those of the said County of Venisse.

That the Frenchmen which have borne Arms with those of Bearne, may enjoy the
profit and benefit of this Edict.

As touching the administration of justice, it may please your Majesty to
consider the demeanors of your courts of Parliament against those of ye
religion, specially in your town of Tholouze, whereby may be judged what is and
always may be their intention. For this cause, it may be your good pleasure to
assign them judges unsuspected, and to ordain that all process between parties
of two religions shall be judged as well in cases civil, as criminal, in
instances as well superior, as inferior, by equal number of judges, whereof the
half shall be Catholic, and the other of the Religion: and where all the
parties be of one religion, that there all the judges likewise may be taken
and appointed of the same religion, except such as be suspected. And that for
this intent there be ordained one chamber or court for the resort of every
Parliament, and one peaceable and unsuspected town for those of the Religion.

That all provisions and declaratio^s obtained during these troubles and since
the 24. of August last by the Catholics, against such sentences judgments and
arrestes as upon learning of the parties, and in time of peace have been given
for the benefit of those of the Religion, shall be revoked and delayed of no
effect and value, as obtained by stealth, the said arrests remaining in their
full force and virtue executorie, according to your ordinances, although those
that have had the said arrests have been persons Ecclesiastical of the Church
of Rome.

That all seats of justice that of old time and before the troubles, have been
holden in the towns now presently possessed by those of the religion shall be
there continued: or if they have been removed, they may be restored and brought
thither again: And generally that all those of the Religion be restored, and
from henceforth without any stay for circumstance of form, fully placed
again in the exercise of their estates and dignities, charges and offices, as
well of your Majesty as of inferior Seignories, and that al provisions to the
contrary be revoked, and other fees and pensions paid as well for the time
past as for ye time to come.

And for as much as diverse of the religion have had by resignation and for
money, according to the usage of your permissio^, certain offices either
Judicial or other, alitle before the beginning of ye present trobles since
which trobles being happened, the resignes by reason of ye hatred borne to
their religion, and for their just fear of murder, have not been able to
obtein the Letters of grant nor to get the resignator aducted of your Maistie.
In the mean time some of them have paid the fine promised wholly or in part,
some other have entered into bonds and given sureties to pay within a short
time which time being incurred ye sureties have been constreyned to make payment
which is not reasonable: it may please your Majesty to declare the said bonds
and promises discharged and as not made, and so to ordein without having
respect to the Judgments which possibly may have been given in the mean time:
And that the said judgments also be declared void and of no efect. That the
money paid for these causes, whether it be to the resigner or his heirs
shall be repayed to the resignes being of the religion, being prevented by just
impedimentes. And where payment has not been made, that in yt case there bond
shall remain not suable and exempt from constraint of Justice.

That these of the religion be admitted and received indifferently to estates
charges of offices as well judicial as other, without difference of religion,
specially of resignes, and yt the receiving and admitting of them shall be
exempte from other courts, and reserved to the chamber yt shallbe erected for
the judgment of their Princes.

That all prescriptions either by convenient custom or Law, whereof ye time
may have been incurred during and since ye first troubles and ye later troubles
that since have happened, until this present shall be deemed and holden as not
incurred.

As touching policies, your Majesty may well have understood how great
disorder and confusion the parcialitie, difference and distinction of persons
for Religion, has brought in this behalf in all towns and places where the
Catholics do in number and power exceed those of the Religion, accompting
them always as degraded unworthy and deprived of public charges and
administrations: It may therefore be your good pleasure beside the declaratio^s
already made by all your Edictes as touching the capabilitie of those of the
Religion, and their common enjoying and participation of those charges, to
ordeine that from hence forth in all the towns and places of this Realm the
said charges be distributed equally between the Catholics and these of the
religion, and namely to avoid the ouerchargings of taxes forbidden by your
Majesty.

That those of the religion remain quite and discharged for all their
assemblies as well general as perticularlly establishment of justice, policy,
and rule among them selves, judgments and executions thereof, voyages,
treaties, negotiactions, and contractes made with all strange princes and
estates, and of all moneys taken of your fiances and receiptes, coynages,
mouables, debtes, arerages of rentes and revenues, felling of woods, sale of
goods mouable, assessing of rentes of ye immouables and rightes belonging to
Eclesiasticall persons and other catholics taxes, impositions of money and
other things, exactions and leueyinges of the same, baylyes ransomming of
prisoners, and of all other kinds of money which by occasion of these trobles
have been taken by them, of the ordeining of these that have had commandment
among them, or of counceles provincial and poletike according to their rules,
so as neither they, nor those that have been appointed for the leueyeng and
disposition of the said moneys mouables and other things abouesayd, nor these
that have delivered and furnished the same, may in any wise be answerable
therefore now nor her after, but that ye sumes to that effect paid by your said
officers and others be allowed by your chambers of accomptes, tresorers of
finances and others by virtue of this Edict with out other warrant.

And that all persons accomptant whether it be of ye receiptes by them
established or other dealing with any thing what soever it be, shall be bound to
verify their accomptes of their dealinges by those that have had general
authority over them, and to the said councels prouincial. And that the like be
done of all those that have had the handeling charge and administration of
money during the former trobles and since the year 1567. And the remain that
shall be found due by the said accomptantes and other detters of ye said moneys
shall be employed to the acquital and discharge of those of the religion for
charges by occasion of the trouble and maintenance of the war. And this done,
the said accomptantes shall remain acquitted of their said administration and
dealinges, and wholly discharged thereof, bringing the aquitance of those that
had the commanding of them in these last trobles made by the advice of ye said
councels Prouincial and according to their rule, so as in time to come neither
they nor their successors shall in any wise be put to answer therefore,
forbidding to al your chambers of accountes and other Judges ordinary or
extraordinary all Jurisdiction and conusance, and to your attorneyes general
or particular al power to sue for the same. That also those of the religion
remain acquitted and discharged for all acts of hostility, leuyeng and
conducting of men of War, founding and taking of artilerie and munitions,
making of powder and saltpeter, takinges dismantellinges and rasinges of towns
and Castles, enterprises against the same, burninges and destroyings of
Churches and houses, and fortifications and reparations of Towns and places
holden in their holding, and generally of all that has been by them don and
practiced during the aforesaid and the former trobles although ye same be not
perticularly expressed and declared, so as for any of the things abouesayd nor
other that have happened in the said trobles, none of them nor of their
posterity in general or in particular be charged nor in any wise reproched
with any matter of Rebellion Disobedience or Treason, notwithstanding all
declarations, Edicts, and ordinances which your Majesty may have made, to the
contrary and that ye same according to ye case, may be revoked and declared of
no effect and value, as well in this respect as in respect of all other things
proceeding or depending upon the said trobles.

That all things taken by private persons without public authority,
Magistrate, Gouernoure, Consul, Captain, or other by their commission, or by
the assemblies of the Comunalties on both parties, and against the rules of the
said assemblies, be restored to those to whom they apertaine, if ye things be
found remaining in their former kind, and if not, then ye value by just
appraisment. And as touching moueables and other things taken by hostility,
although they be found remaining in their kind, they shall not be challenged
nor subject to restitution.

That the fruits of this present year that have been taken and levied until
the day and date of these present Articles, be declared not to be subject to
any restitution on the one part or the other, to the intent to stope all
variances and process that by this occasion may arise among your subjects.

That these of the Religion be not constrained nor drawn into yt law for
payment of impositions ordinary and extraordinary assessed by the Catholics
during the present and former trobles, but shall thereof remain acquitted and
discharged.

And for as much as in all places where we have warred for our defense, ye
charges have been so expressed and importable, that the most part of us are
greatly in detted and charged, It may please your Majesty to give us leave to
have an imposition and tax to be set among all us of the Religion, at the
least to the some of six score thousand pounds payable in two years to be
employed to the full discharg of our said deftes: And for the leuyeng thereof to
grant us necessary means of constraint as it were for your own money.

It may please your Majesty to grant to those of ye Religion which in the
trobles passed have bought any thing Temporal of Eclesiasticall persons and
truly paid ye price thereof, that they may continue the possession and enjoying
of the things by them bought for ye assurance of their Money, until they be
recompensed by the said Ecclesiastical persons or other yt will or may redeem
the same with this condition yt they shall leave the possession immediately after
such repayment to them made.

Now Sir, rests ye principal point, namely the means of a true and just
surety for the holding, enduring, assurance and perpetual inviolable
mainteyning of your Majesty's promises and ordinances touching all the matters
above said by a firm and continuing peace, wherein we are most sorry and much
agreued to propounde, and to demand of your Majesty by our most humble
supplication such means as seem to us pertinent and reasonable yea and
necessary to the establishment for ever of a good and firm peace in this
Realm. For we had rather that these means had been offered us of your
Fatherly good will and favor, and of your own proper motion.

But for as much as it pleases your Majesty to permit us and to do us that
honor to demand it of you, we most humbly beseech your goodness that it be your
good pleasure, for the commodity of your estate, the rest of your consience,
the greatness and assurance of this Crown, and the common benefit and quiet
of your Subjects, to contracte an unity and League of new promise, coniuncti,
on, and Amity to endure, with all the Princes Potentates and estates of
Almaigne and Swisserland that be of the Religion, and the Queens of England
and Scotland, to this intent, with one common hand and consent to maintain
unity as well between them and their Subjects, as between your Majesty and
all your Subjects entierly both those that be called Catholics and those that
be named of the Religion reformed, and this to be don in all civil and human
things. That al these allies promise and swear to mayntaine ye said unity
coniunccion and amity for the common continuing of all in the said estate and
community of all Civil and human things, in like manner as if they were
all of one religion, and this to be done in every estate of the Countries
Lands and Seignories of ye said Kings Princes Potentates or commonweals.

That they swear and promise that none of the said Lords Kings or their
successors, Princes Potentats or commonweals shall break the said unity, nor
violate the public faith and promises as well between the said allies as
between any of their subjects: yt those which shall observe it on their part,
may by all ways of force constrain him or them that shall do to the
contrary. And that they be bound to do ye like at the only request of those
who^ it shall concern, truly observing ye said unity, of whether soever
religion they be.

That for eschewing a conspiracy of a Sicilian euensong) as they term it)
those of the religion in this realm may have by special privilege and grant
in perpetuity, the keeping of the towns and places which we hold at this
present, and also of certain other towns in every province, such as shall be
thought mete by the eight special persons indifferently chosen by two that
your Majesty will depute and two that those of ye religion shall name: which
is to be done with expedicion at the place to be agreed upon.

That your Majesty's garrisons be placed only in ye frontier towns and places
where garrisons has of ancient time been used, or at the least as far of as
well may be from the said towns and places now presently holden by those of
the religion, be it in coming or going of the said garriso^s, and that there
be not lodged greater number of horse with their armures without the consent of
these of the religion, and that they come and seiourne so modestly, that
thereof arise no suspicion nor inconvenience.

It may please your Majesty to take in good part, that we most humbly
beseech you, that your Governors and Lieuetenants general that will pass by
or visit the said towns and places now holden by those of the Religion, may
not come thither with force nor with great company, than with their ordinary
and accustomed train in time of peace, and that they be admonished, so to
behave them selves in the said towns and places, as those of the Religion may
have no occasion thereby to enter into fear and suspicion, And that the like be
observed by the Lords of the said Towns and places.

That nothing of the said towns and places holden by those of the religion be
rased, that has been made for fortification, saving only so far as they shall
think it expedient for their surety. And that there be not required or taken
from them any of their munitio^s of war or armor, whether it be artillary or
other.

And for the greater and better efficacy of your royal authority and good
will to the upright and sincere observation of the Articles of this peace: We
most humbly beseech your Majesty that first in full assembly of your privy
counsel, and afterward in your court of Parliament of Paris, in full audience,
by your Majesty, the Queens your most honorable mother and spouse, our
sovereign Ladies, my Lords your brethred, and the Lords the Princes of your
blood, the Lords Mareschals of France, and the counselors of your privy
counsel, it be confirmed and sworn that the Articles of this peace shall be
entirely maintained, and perpetually and faithfully observed. And that the like
be done by all your presidents, counselors, advocates, procurators or
attorneys, and every of them in all other your Courts of Parliaments, and
presidencies.

That for mutual observation of a perpetual obedience and fidelity, those of
the Religion throughout this Realm generally, together with the Catholics,
renew their oaths offidelitie before your officers in their places, with
enterchangeable condition and promise on both parts, never hereafter to commit
any slaughters one against an other generally or particularly, by whom so ever
the same be commanded, without exception: but to leave the whole conusance of
crimes and public revenge to the course of your laws, as is agreed in these
articles of peace.

And to the intent to come by little and little to a true entier and general
reconciliation of amity among all your subjects of both the religions: We
most humbly beseech your Maistie to ordain that every year during five years
the said oath be renewed, as well by the assemblies of the estates of every
Province in one of the most peaceable towns in each Province, as at other
general assemblies of the inhabitants of every principal Town of ye diocese,
which shall be holden at sundry terms among those of the two Religions, that
is to say, in the principal assembly by the Deputies of either Religion as well
of the nobility as of the commons of the whole province, and in the assembly of
every Dioces and Bayliwicke: where they shall promise and swear not only to
keep firm peace and amity mutually, but also to employe their lives and
goods for your service, and specially to maintain this unity and
pacification against all breakers and disturbers thereof without any exception
as is abouesayd.

Finally we hope that your Majesty shall well like, that we your most humble
and most obedient subjects continue our standing upon our Guard, without
doing any force or hostility, under the suspencion and intermission which it
has pleased your Majesty to enjoin us.

The Kings answer to the Deputies of the reformed Churches of the country of
Languedoc and other places adjoining.
THE King having understood the declaratio^s that to him have been made by
those of the Religion called reformed being sent unto his Majesty, using
toward them his clemency and natural goodness, has by mouth declared unto
them the assurance that they ought to have of his good grace favor and
protection when they shall by the effects show them selves such toward him
as al good and loyal subjects ought to be to their Prince: whereunto he has
sufficiently moved them by his last Edict, under the benefit whereof they have
all due satisfaction of that which they have always showed themselves to desire
touching the exercise of their pretensed Religion and the surety of their
persons and goods. And for as much as they have always declared that they have
no other will but to satisfy the commandments of his said Majesty, he has
thought good, for their better conformity, to send the Duke de Uses peer of
France, and the Lord of Caplus Knight of his order to Monsieur de Dampuille
Marshall of France his Governor and Lieutenant general in Languedoc, to say
to him on his Majesty's behalf, that he choose some town or place of his
government near to Montauban, and which he shall think fittest for the
purpose, and that he repair thither, and there advertise those of the Religion
called reformed, that they send thither the said Deputies or other whom they
will on their behalf, for conference to be had with them by the said Lord
Marshall, touching their quiet, surety, and preservation, and other things
concerning and appertaining unto the execution and observing of the said Edict,
and also the course of law and justice, which his Majesty means to have
ministered unto them with all uprightness and equity: Also to be advised of
such procurations as shall be necessary for the particularities depending upon
the said case, to the end that by the xv. day of December, by which time his
Majesty hops to be returned to his town of Compiegne from the voyage that
he presently makes to the frontiers of his realm, for conducting his brother
the king of Polonia going toward his kingdom, his Majesty being then
advertised of the whole by the said Lord Mareshal, may give order as to him
shall seem necessary. And where he is required by the said deputies to
prolong the ceassing of arms, his Majesty will write to the said Lord
Mareshall, to cause all acts of hostility to cease, provided always that they
of the religion give order on their part, that nothing be atttempted to the
contrary, as of late has been done, which his Majesty does expressly forbid.

At Villiers-Cotterets, the 18. day of October. 1573. Thus signed, CHARLES.
And underneath. FIZEL.

A request exhibited to the King by the Deputies of the third estate of the
Countries of Languedocke, Dolphine, and Province.
Sir,
before we went in hand with the charge that was committed unto us by your most
humble and obedient subjects ye people of the third estate of your country
and County of Prouence, Folcaquier, and the Lands bordering thereupon, we well
foresawe three points which would make our suit odious or at leastwyse not so
well favored as we gladly would have desired, that we might return into our
country with good speed of the thing for which we come and present our selves
sewters unto your Majesty.

The first is, that it is an unseemly thing for Subjects to inquire of ye
peculiar affaiers of their King, or to go about to demand a reason why he
does them. The Second is, that subjects ought to have a sure good opinion of
their Princes good meaning toward them, and that he will not grieve them with
extraordinary subsidies, without great cause and urgent necessity, and
therefore that the sessing of them lies not in the controlment of the
Subjects. The third is, that it is an unseemly and intolerable rashness of the
Subjects, to intend to bridle or restrain the affairs of the state, whereof
they have no knowledge but superficially and by conjecture. And in very deed
these three points have made us to refuse our commission often times, and we
had not condescended to have received it, but for three other considerations
that were laid before us in the assembly of the three estates, held in the
Month of July last past in your town of Aix. One was the consideration of your
natural goodness and clemency, sufficiently showed by experience toward
your subjects, where through we ought to hope for gentle and favorable
audience in the woeful state of your said Country of Prouence, whereof it may
be that your Majesty is not faithfully advertised. An other is, that good
Kings, Princes, and Potentates, have at al times not only harkened to the
complaints and griefs of their people, but also received the^ and gently
disburdened the Deputies of such and so importunat charges. The last is, yt in
extremities me^ ought to have free and vnrestreyned recourse to him that is
only able to apply the needful remedy. Whereunto we may ad, that many things
are don under ye authority of Kings without their knowledge, for which they be
now and then displeased with such as have not advertised them of them. Surely
Sir, all these considerations have we set before us, to the intent that all men
may know, that we come not as Mutiners, Rebels, or Sedicious persons, to
countermaund your treasure, or to inquyre perticulerly of the employment
thereof, or to call in question the faithfulness and upright dealing of such as
have the ordering of your receytes: but only to give you true intelligence how
great charges, impositio^s, aids subsidies, tallages, taxes, increases, and
other contributio^s, this poor and miserable third state pays and bears.
But peradventure Sir, you will think it strange that we which are Deputies for
Proue^ce, should also interlace the griefs and complaints of the Third estate
of your Contries of Languedocke and Dolphenie. Nevertheless I which am the
messenger, am assisted by the Deputies of the said Contries here present, who
gave me in commission so to do as we met to gether by chance at Tarrare,
because we had all one message and suit. Therefore sir, it is done to the
intent your Majesty should not be troubled with the repetition of like matters.
And forasmuch as our griefs are all upon the self same points and tend to one
self same end: they have chosen me alone to speak indifferently for all the
three countries alike, which thing I have so much the more willingly and boldly
taken upon me, because your highness has had experience of my loyalty,
honesty, and sincerity in your Country of Prouence, where it has pleased
your Majesty to advance me, to one of your chief rooms of your Counsel.

Sir, your County of Prouence belonged of old time to the kingdom of
Austrasie, and until the time of Reyner king of Sicili, who made a gift of it
to king Jews the eleventh, it continued always under the dominion of the
Dukes of Lorraine and Bar. In the time of the said good king, (whom some have
seen that are alive at this day) the men of Prouence paid not any tallages,
impositions, ayds, subsidies, gables, or other manner of contributions at all,
but lived welthely and merely of the revenues of their demayns, in peace withal
their neighbors, and passing their time in making those excellent kind of
peytings which are yet still to be seen in the palace of Aix the chief City
of Prouence.

King Jews at his taking of possession of the country of Prouence, granted
and confirmed all their privileges which they had in ye time of good king
Reyner, which continued so to the time of the great king Francis the first, who
upon necessity of the defense of the same country when Charles the fifth came
down into it, made the people thereof taxable and subject to other impositions
of his Realm.

The country of Viennoys and Dolphenie, at such time as it was sold to your
Majesty's predecessors by Sir Humbert Dolphine, did enjoy like fraunchises and
liberties as the country of Prouence.

So likewise did the country of Languedoc in the times of Raymond and Berrager
Earls of Tholouze. And to say the truth, neither taxes, ayds, subsidies nor
impositio^s were heard of, any where throughout all the shires of the Realm,
till the Englishmen had gotten the better part thereof, for the dispossessing of
whose usurpations, our kings were constrained to raise great powers and armies
of men. And because the sovereign dominion was held by ye Englishmen: the
Frenchmen, (whose faythfulnesse and loyalty passes al other nations of the
earth) granted to king Charles the sixth, to tax the^ and cease them: and that
was the first time that tallages began, as ye Registers of the Parliament and
of the chamber of accounts do bear record.

When these so light Taxes and of so small estimation could not counteruaile so
great an enterprise, he desired the estates to help him in yt necessity. Then
they gaunted him a Twentieth of their wines, and afterward an Eighth and a
Fourth. In the end it came to setting of impost upon Salt. And all these
Impositions were named helps, as ye end of their device witnesses, which was
to take place but so long as the Wars lasted, as the Records of the said
Court and Chamber of accountes do purport. Nevertheless the People of France
are so obedient to their Kings, that they have continued the paying of them
freely, and are very well contented to continue the^ still, notwithstanding yt
they had ceased for a time after that the Englishmen were driven quite and
clean out of the Realm.

The great King Frauncis who was as sore vexed and weried with wars as was
possible, died happily without over charging of his people, saying with a
custom of the xx. penny set upon the Marchandises that went out of the
Realm, and with certain tolles set upon the wines, that were brought into the
great Towns, whereunto were added certain tenthes, taken of the Clergy.

King Henry inhaunced again the Tenths, and established the rights of Doua^ne,
high passage, foreign wars, and foreign Impositions. As for ye poor people,
they for their own succor were charged with no more but Tax faithfully
ordained for the payment of the men of War, and yet it is well known that the
said good Prince was combred with as many affairs as any Prince. At this day
Sir, it is clean contrary to that it was in King Lewis the Eleuenths time.
For the ordinary taxes of Dolphenie were but lxx. Thousand Pounds turnoyes,
and the taxes of Languedocke were six score and twelve Thousand Pound Turnoyes.

In the time of great King Frauncis, and at his taking at Pauie, they were
increased: in Dolphenie forty thousand pound Turnoys, and in Languedocke
three score and ten thousand and eight hundred. Which ought to be counted no
great matter, considering the great need that was for the deliverance of the
king and of the Princes his children.

Afterward in the time of king Henry, the taxes of Dolphine and Languedocke
were let alone in the same state that they were at the decease of King
Frauncis. Likewise also were the taxes newly imposed upon Prouence, which were
four score and six thousand pound turnoyes. And at that time the tallage was
for Prouence but two and thirty thousand: for Dolphine seven and twenty
thousand: and for Languedoc fifty two thousand, three hundred, three score and
two pounds turnoyes.

At the beginning of your Majesty's reign, which was altogyther peaceable and
without civil dissension, the ordinary tax of Languedocke was raised to five
hundred and twelve thousand seven hundred four score and ten pounds: The tax
of Prouence to three hundred, three score and sixtene thousand, four hundred
twenty and eight pounds turnoyes, with the increases of two, three, and four
sowses of ye pound, amounting to more than a moytie of the foresaid sums. And
the tallages are doubled. Upon every tonne of wine is set an impost of five
shillings. And imposition is set upon ye Oils by assignation of process.
Leuies of money have bin made now six times already by extraordinary
Commissioners, and loans as well general as particular, amounting in Prouence
to twelve hundred thousand pound turnoyes, comprehending therein the taxes of
the parishes: in Dolphinie to nine hundred thousand pounds: and in Languedocke
to more than two millions and three hundred thousand pounds turnoyes, besides
the vent of Ecclesiastical goods and the tenthes, which is four times as much
as the old taxation was wont to be, together with a general subsidy never
erst sessed upon the cities and great towns, to be paid in three years,
whereof the last payment fell out the last year, and a new custom is set upon
cloth. We speak not of other small gatheringes of money yt have bin made in
those three. Shyres for the waging, furnishinge, and intertayning of men of war
during these civil troubles. But the strange things that have bin done in
the plain Country, and the fyning and raunsoming of the poor people in the
said Shyres, does in estimation exceed all the taxes, increaces, helps,
subsidies, impositions, and all other leuyings, ordinary and extraordinary.
For if the Soldier were not paid his wages, he burst out intoo all
licentiousenesse of pilling, pollinge, oppressinge, raunsoming, and other
outrages which are not wont to be done in ye co^ntries of enemies or of
conquest. See I beseech you, how your Majesty's poor people have their
fat, their flesh, and their blood drayned from them. Let your highness
think you see a true anatomy of a man's body, whereof there remains nothing
but skin and bones, and yet those also all too torn and broozed. For your
people resembles it with great compassion, desiring too be relieved and
strengthened again, which thing can not be among so many impositions, and
specially with war. A true King is lykened to a good Shepherd, whose
property it is to fleece his sheep, but not too flea them.

Wherefore your Majesty's people of the third state of those three poor and
desolate Countries, do most humbly beseech your Highness to vouchsafe to
provide for ye general pacification of these troubles, and to have regard of
the miseries, ruins, poverty, calamities, desolations, murders, wastinges,
sackinges of towns, hauockes, exactio^s, oppressions, pillinges, ransominges,
mischeues, forcing of wives, deflouring of maidens, and other wickednesses
coming thervppon: and to bring the said shyres again to good tranquillity
union and concord, by such means as your Majesty shall perceive most
reasonable: for other wise it is impossible for men too live in such disorder
as ye ungraciousness of the time has brought upon the said shyres, which are
drayned so dry both of money and means, that the people of the said third
state can hardly shift to live, because ye men of war have pilled and fleesed
away all yt ever is, so as there remains not any great Cattle or money for
ye people to help them selves wtall

These are the causes that drive us to sue unto your Majesty, to discharge the
third estate of the said Countries for these six Years of the said taxes,
Increaces, and other Subsidies and of all other impositions both ordinary and
extraordinary, and after ye said term of six years, to bring all things
again to the state that they were at in the time of King Lewis ye twelfth or
at the leastwise under the reign of Francis the first. Nevertheless, in cases
of necessity, even during ye said term the people of the said Third estate,
do willingly offer your Majesty all their goods and their lives without
restraint. Which suit we beseech your Highness to wey well, and to apoynte
some trusty and faithful men of authority, to inquire to what uses so great
sumes of money hitherto leuyed of your people have been employed, and to cause
the men of war to be well paid hereafter, which is the only means to make
them live in order under good rule and warlike discipline: and the people of
the said third Estate, will pray to GOD for the preservation and increase of
your highness in all prosperity and health.

The Kings answer to the Deputies of the third State of the three Countries
of Dolphine, Languedocke, and Prouence.
THE King has taken in very good part the complaints, griefs, and requests
made by the deputies of the third state of the Countries of Languedocke,
Dolphine, and Province, and assures them that he will relieve the^ as soon as
his affairs may give him leave. It maruelously greeueth his Majesty, that his
poor people have suffered so many wrong full troubles. For the appeasing
whereof he has caused his Edict to be proclaimed, intending to have it kept,
and will to the uttermost of his power reach out his hand yet further to a
greater pacification. And his said majesty does all his subjects to
understand, that he is charged with allowances to the Princes his brethren,
and of the Ladies his Sisters, with the interteynement of the Queen, with the
dowries of his mother and of the Scottish Queen, with the allowances of the
old Queen Elinor, and of the Duchesses of Berrey and Ferrara, wherewith the
kings his Grandfather and Father were not charged, over and besides an infinite
mass of dettes, whereof the said kings his Graundfather and Father left him in
arrerages: which things have been the cause of his further charging of his said
people, to his great grief.

Made to Villiers-Cotterets the 18. of October. 1573.
The answer and advertisement of the Lord Lodowicke Earl of Nassau to the
King.
THe Lord Lodowicke Earl of Nassau, for the zeal which he has of the good
success of the kings Majesty's affairs, having not long ago talked freely
and plainly with the Lords of Schombert and Fregouza at Frankford, and
afterward with the said Lord Schombert at Cassel, thought that his Majesty
should have had intelligence of all, as well by the letters of the said Lord
Schombert, as by word of mouth of the said Fregouza, hoping also that he would
have taken all things in good part, according as it proceeded from a heart that
was at his commandment. Nevertheless the said Earl perceives by
instructions from the said Fregouza lately roturned unto him, and
understands thoroughly by his words, that his Majesty takes all things as
though he had meant to bridle him in his own Realm. Wherein notwithstanding,
it was the said Earls intent but to show his Majesty freely and uprightly,
the only means whereby he knew he might attain to the thing that he
pretended, which was to knit a firm friendship and good league with the
Protestant Princes, and to put away and bury the evil report that went of his
Majesty, as well by common devises of pictures, as by reproachful Books, and
finally to assure him self of good aid against the king of Spain, in who^ he
espieth daily diverse evil meanings toward him. And forasmuch as his Majesty's
said mistaking of things has caused the said Earl to fear, least he were not
informed of the thing which he would faynest have him to know, and which he
thinks in sound conscience to be the fittest way to bring the thing to pass
which his Majesty pretends: he has dispatched to him the Lord Chastelier,
to inform him more particularly of his meaning, and of the things which he
sees to be expedient for the compassing of his desire, Humbly beseechinge his
Majesty to believe that his so doing, is not upon any peculiar passion, or for
any affection that he has to any other thing, than to see him in better
estimation and reputation than he is among strange Princes and Potentates, and
further of from the destruction that preaseth hard at his heels.

The means for him to come to the foresaid ends with the said Protestant
Princes, and to recover the reputation whereof the former outrages have bereft
him, is that his Majesty should first and formest surcease his wars against
them of the Religion, which is the true and only ground work whereupon he
may build his reputation new again, and whatsoever he lists besides with the
Protestant Princes. For otherwise it is impossible for him to prevail.

And it is no brideling of his Majesty, but a receiving of favor at his hand,
when the said Princes may so trust in him as in them selves, and shall see in
good earnest that there lurketh none evil meaning toward them: which thing
cannot be, so long as his Majesty shall persecute them of the same Religion in
his Realm, whereof the said Princes make profession, and whereupon they
ground themselves. By reason whereof they can never hope for any steadfast
friendship or league with his Majesty, so long as he shows him self so sore
against them in the chief point, namely Religion, which is the thing that
over rules the doings of men. Wherefore it is requisite to give his Majesty
a Blanke whereon he might contitinually set his eye, that first and formest he
let the Protestants alone in peace.

And to the end that his Majesty should think, that these be no discourses
in the air: the said Earl beseeches him to remember, that the same had been
the welspring of all his reputation: and to call to mind what he had said to
his hignes the first day of his coming to Bloys, in the evening and many other
times duringe the treaty of the king of Nauarres marriage, namely that
forasmuch as his Majesty had labored so much to set peace among his subjects,
and freely granted the Protestants the exercise of their Religion: the said
Lords and Princes desiring to be mayntained in like liberty, bare him so
hearty good will, that in devising ere whiles among themselves who^ they might
wish to be their Lord (if the case should so fall out as to come to election)
they desired his Majesty with one mind, wishing his auauncement and increase,
and having not any thing more common in their mouths than his praises.
Whereupon the said Earl said unto his Majesty, that he hoped one day to
see the imperial Crown upon his head, and that his Majesty might believe
that that saying of his came not of himself, but of such as having the
authority and power to do it, made their full account to choose him to be king
of Romans. VVherin his Majesty should have this advantage, that whereas other
Princes were wont to buy and purchase it by all means, and to offer all manner
of conditions of advantage that they could devise for the purpose, (like as
the Emperor now present, his Majesty's father in law had never ben chosen
without earnest suit and solemn promises made, whereof one among many other was
that he swear to maintain every man in freedom of conscience and exercise of
the Religion:) his Majesty should be entreated and sued unto, to take that
great dignity upon him.

That was the very cause why they of the low countries perceiving their Prince
to depart from his promises, and from the condicio^s whereunto he was bound,
and that on the contrary part, his Majesty used his subjects so lovingly:
wished withal their hearts to have him to their sovereign Lord, casting
themselves into his arms, to the end to have the freedom of their consciences
and the exercise of their religion, and generally to enjoy the selfsame benefit
which his Majesty's subjects then did by his permission.

It was the selfsame and the chiefest reason that moved the Queen of England
to make league with his Majesty a little before the murder.

But now contrariwise his Majesty is nere his fall, his state is weakened on
all sides, and he is as it were abandoned to the pray to whosoever lists to
take it because that through his last outrage and former wars made to force
the consciences of his subjects, he is so destitute of noble men and men of
war, yea and of the strongest fortress or hold of his Realm, which is the
love and good will of his subjects, that he is become like an old house, that
is daily shored up with some proppes, and yet in the end cannot be kept from
falling down.

His Majesty may see how the Spanishe king his mortal enemy makes his hand
of the backwardness of his estate, laughing with open mouth at his
misfortunes, and employing al his study, and indeuer to maintain trouble in
his realm: assuringe him self (and not without good cause) that it is the
only means to attain to his purpose without stroke stryking, since that the
Spaniard has more weakened his Majesty by the former wars, late slaughter
and present troubles, than if he had made thirty years war against him
himself. Furthermore, the Spaniard serves his own turn against his Majesty
every where where he can, with the late outrage, as he did alate in Poleland as
his Majesty understands well enough: and the same was the only cause of
courtesy and faithfulness which the Duke of Alua used toward the said Earl
at his goinge out of Mons, as he himself reported to diverse afterward, namely
that he did it to show that he would not commit so foul a treachery as the
French king had done, and that he was not sorry for the Admirals mischaunce,
because he was the king his Masters deadly enemy, but yet he had lever to
have lost both his arms, than to have done that deed.

And if his Majesty continue his purpose of making war against the
protestants, and will not suffer them in his realm: the said Earl can assure
him, that the Duke his brother leaving him in that plight to go into Polonia,
shall never be welcome thither. But the people of that country thinking that
he comes to set them in a broyle as France is, will count him but as a
cipher in Agrim, and the Princes of the land, in steed of coming forth every
where to meet him on the way for his honor, will drawn back a ten leagues of
for fear to see him. And contrary wise, if he make himself a mean of good
peace in France be, fore he go thence, he shall be received, loved and honored
as much as heart can think-and the foresaid Princes will wait for him by the
way, to do him all the honor and solemnity in receiving him, that they can
devise.

And so long as his Majesty abides in the same mind that he is in at this
day, the said Earl sees not that it is to any purpose for him to hope that
the Prince Elector the Palsgraue should send to the Queen of England for the
accomplishing of marriage between her and the Duke: and much less that the said
prince Elector should consent that the Prince Casimire his son should serve
his Majesty: for the said Earl was sure that it should smally boot him to
move the matter, neither could he do it with a safe conscience, so long as
his Majesty is in arms against the protestants.

His Majesty has all occasions that can be wished to draw away his armed
hand from his subjects, and to cease his wars against them, besides that
the Duke his brother the chosen king of Polonia, if he desire to be well
received, and to assure those country men, that his being among them, shall not
be to trouble them or to disquiet their consciences, but to maintain them in
the freedom wherein he found them, may also as the Duke his brother, upon
like occasion make means to his Majesty, not to disquiet the protestants:
and that if they depart otherwise, the one into Poland, and the other into
England: besides that it should fall out ill for them selves in respect of the
reasons aforesaid, they should leave his Majesty with such a war upon his
hand as should be so much the more hard and daungerouse, in respect of the
abateme^t of his power, with the smalnesse of his comfort, and (which worse is)
for that he should not have any man whom he might trust with the leading of
his army, for as much as some are too seruisable and affectioned toward the
Spanish King as his feed men, and his Majesty could not trust any man by
reason of the things that had passed.

Moreover, the said Earl could not forget to advertise his majesty, that
beyond the seas men began to be grieved at the French fashions, and to wax
loath to deal with them, because they bewray themselves to go unsoundly to
work, and to seek for nothing but dissimulation: as not long ago while the
Queen of England was deliberating upon the treaty of marriage between her
Majesty and the Duke, in the mean while ships of war were sent privily in
to Scotland, to stir up and maintain troubles there, and to make them spread
by little and little into England.

Again, the brute goes commonly here, that the men whom his Majesty sends
abroad, are all of them spies which come to discover what is done in princes
houses, and moreover that all the discourses which his Majesty makes with
Ambassadors, (specially in the name of the Pope) and all the dispatches which
he makes unto Rome, are but tales and colors of assurance of good will, too
overthrow the protestants on all sides, and namely the foresaid princes.

And that there appears so much dissimulation and untruth in his majesty's
letters and words, as men cannot tell how to trust them in any good case:
like as in his letters written to the said princes upon the wounding of the
Lord Admiral, when he had given them to understand that he was sore
displeased at the receyt of such a mischaunce, and would make such an example
of justice of it, as should be remembered while the world endured: A two
days after, he caused it to be proclaimed that it was his own doing.

Furthermore, how much assurance so ever his majesty gave after the death of
the said L. Admiral throughout all places of his dominion, that he meant not
neither would, that any man should by any means alter his Edict of
pacification: it can not in any wise agree with the war which he makes
presently against his subjects of the religion, and much less with his own
saying that he would not suffer any other Religion tha^ his own within his
realm.

By reason of which persuasions, the prince cannot think that his Majesty's
promising to succor him in the offer which he caused to be made to the said
Earl without condition, was spoken with a playnmeaning heart, but rather
fears that the same proceeded out of the selfsame shopp that the former
things came, because that in the letters of the Spanishe Ambassador which were
surprised a while ago as they were coming out of France to the Duke of
Alua, it was seen that the Queen mother used such speech as this: I cannot
think that these so good Christians will make any agreement with the
Heretics: she spoke those words of the Prince to his hinderaunce, and
therefore it is unlikely that there was any good meaning toward the
furtherance of his affairs.

The said Earl besecheth his Majesty yet further, to set before his eyes what
he has oftentimes told him of the Cardinal of Lorreine: namely, that his
doings were so suspiciouse on all sides, that whereas he was in credit with
his Majesty, and had the ordering of all his affairs, it was not too be
thought (so far as could be seen) that he would deal soundly or
incorruptly in any thing, by reason of the great priuitie which he had with the
Spaniardes: yea and much less, in as much as it is reported, that he has
offered his majesty a great sum of money, to employ it against the
protestants.

Moreover, the said Earl beseeches his Majesty to call to mind, what his
highness has said unto him oftentimes: namely, that he considered well the
mischiefs that had assailed him on all sides, and that if he might by Gods
grace once remedy them, by the peace which he has payned himself so much to
make, he would take good heed, that he fell no more into them. For whereas he is
at this hour further over the shoes tha^ ever he was, through the counsel of
such as under his name do bring those in suspicion which are called the heads
of the factio^s, and provoke him to make clean riddance of them by what means
so ever it be, as he did by the last slaughter: his Majesty may well see, it
was not to leave of so, but to make him bathe himself more than before in the
blood of his poor subjects, to the end to hasten his own ruin the more,
whereof they have laid the platt a long time before hand: which skarre his
majesty may yet for all this heal up again, by making a good peace in his
realm, and by ceassing to trouble his subjects of the reformed religion.

Finally, the said Earl desires his Majesty to bethink him of this point,
that although he had taken all the towns that are hild by the Protestants in
his Realm, yet should he not have rooted out the Religion: and to consider
also, that the late Emperor Charles the fifth did not only take the towns,
but also had the persons in his hands that did set themselves against his
procedings, seized upon their lands, and beat down their fortresses, and yet
for all that could nor drive the Religion out of Germany, because it is a
thing so rooted in men's hearts, that it cannot be weeded out by force of
arms.

Wherefore the said Earl most humbly beseeches his Majesty, to take these
reasons in as good part, as the Earl has without passion or particular
affection, soundly, truly, and with good conscience commanded the Lord of
Chastelier to prefer them to his understanding, and to wey them and consider
them well and thoroughly, not suffering himself to be flattered by such as play
the lewd Physicians, which tell not their pacient the least part of his
disease, whereupon follows his undoing, but rather crediting such as seek
nothing but his good furtherance and great increase. If he do so: his affairs
shall have as good success, as he would wish. If not, but that he continue
still in his former behavior: all that ever he can do shall but turn to his
undoing, and imbattell both God and men still more and more against him.

FINIS.
Concerning the conclusion and effect that has ensued of these requests and
aduises, and touching the decease of the French King.
IT is good for subjects to trust and pray that Kings shall live. It is good
for Kings to think and know that kings may and must die. Many have bin the
examples thereof, and great is the fruit to the wise co^siderers. Gods is the
judgment and execution, man's is the good or harm as God is to dispose in
wrath or favor. The end is Gods honor. It is therefore good for all, even the
highest, to fear God, and to govern subjects as Gods people. And sweet is
the comfort to those noble Princes, whose hearts and consciences the spirit of
God feelingly assures, that they have lead their people in truth, holden them
in Justice, and preserved them in mercy and equity. Let the one Realm of
France, in their Kings, their subjects, and their state, preach to
Christendom the mortality of kings, the miseries of civil wars, the losses
by disloyalty of word and deed, the fruits of truth, right, and peace. Gods
is the justice, and judgment, whose be the honor of all things seeming to men
good or evil.

The valiant and famous French king Henry the second, when he was in greatest
appearance of felicity and joy, in the entric of peace, in the feasts of
marriage, in the very acts of triumph, and even than when after execution of
sundry for the cause of conscience he had Annas du Burg and other counselors
of the Parliament of Paris in prison, whom for their Religion he thought meet
and intented to have put to death, was hurt and slain, to the great loss,
dissolution and lamentation of that mighty kingdom.

His son Francis the second, enriched with one kingdom more than ever his
father or his ancestors enjoyed, the Realm of Scotland, when after execution
of many persons upon the tumult of Amboise, and the death of the Vidame of
Chartres, he had the prince of Co^de, Madame de Roye, and other noble persons
and gentlemen, prisoners in the Bastile of Paris and elsewhere, was suddenly
taken away by the hand of God to the great destitution and sorrow of those that
depended upon his Majesty.

Charles the ninth, now lately deceased second son of King Henry, and younger
Brother to the said Frauncis, when he thought himself delivered of those whom
he supposed dangerous to his estate, and whom he charged with most heinous
conspiracy, found afterward mighty resistance by the remnants of that
execution, by whom these Articles of request were presented unto him:
whereupon has not followed such full conclusion as had been to be wished for
the quiet of that kingdom. Since which time, and the lamentable troubles
depending, when the said king had his own Brother, with the next Prince of his
blood, his greatest Mareshals of his Realm, and a number of noble men, in
custody and prison, and daily expectation was of a total destruction of some
part of his subjects, God has added him to his auncesters.

The circumstances of his disease, the cause, occasion and manner of his death,
pertayneth not to us. It was the work of God. No doubt, he lacked not the
care of a mother, the counsel of Phisicians and cunning persons, the help,
advise, wish and prayer of the famous king his brother, and all that men might
do. But Kings who to us in resemblance are Gods, to them selves in Nature be
men. God give to all Princes, not that opinion only, but also that cogitation,
both to think it, and think upon it. God give quiet to that christian region
of our neighbors, and an heart to all Christian governor:, to have care of the
safety and peace of their posterity. For beyond all posterity there is a
King of Kings to be answered, And GOD give us Englishmen quiet and thankful
hearts, that we may rest in unity, cleave to present state, abhor changes,
and so use our Religion that God find it not necessary to withdraw our highest
treasure. Amen.
