Philotus directis his speich to Emilie. O Lusty luifsome lamp of licht,
our bonynes our beauty bricht
our staitly stature trym and ticht
With gesture grave and good:
our countenance, our color cleir
our lauching lips, our smyling cheir,
our properties dois all appeir,
My senses to illude.
2
Quhen I our beauty do behald,
I man unto our fairnes fald:
I dow not fly howbeit I wald,
Bot bound I man be ouris:
For ow sweit heart I wald forsaik,
The Empryce for to be my maik,
Thairfoir deir dow sum pity tak,
And saif me fra the schowres.
3
Deem na ill of my age my dow,
I se play the onkeris part to ow.
First try the treuth, then may e trow,
Gif I mind to desaue:
For Gold nor geir e sall not want.
Sweit heart with me thairs be na scant,
Thairfoir some grace unto me grant,
For courtesy I crave.

Pleasant. Ha, ha quha brocht their bittocks hither
The mekill feind resaue the fithir:
I trow e was not al together,
This twel-month at ane preiching.
Allace I lauch for lytill luck,
I lauch to sie ane auld Carle gucke:
Wow wow sa fame as he wald f^,
Fra he fall till his fleitching.
5
Now wallie as the Carle he caiges.
Gudeman quha hes maid our mustages?
Lo as the bo^ of fourescoir ages,
As he micht not be biddin:
Came e to wow our Less, now lachter,
e ar sa rasch their will be slachter,
e will not spair nor speir quhais aucht her,
e ar sa raschlie riddiu.

Emily. 6
I wait not weill sir quhat e meine,
Bot suirlie I have seindill seine,
Ane wower of our eirs sa keine,
As e appeir to be:
I think ane man sir, of our eiris.
Sold not be blyndit with the bleiris,
Ga seik ane party of our peires,
For e get nane of me.

The auld man speikis to the Macrell to allure the Madyn. 7
Good Dame, I have ow to employ.
Sa e my purpose can convoy:
And that on Less I micht enjoy,
e sold not want rewaird:
Give her this Tablet and this King,
This Pursse of gold and spair nathing:
Sa e about all weill may bring,
Of gold tak na regaird.

Macrell. 8
Na sir, let me and that allane,
Suppose scho war maid of a stane,
I se gar her grant or all be gane,
To be at our command:
Thocht scho be strange, I think na wonder,
Blait things is sone brocht in ane blunder,
Scho is not the first sir, of ane hunder,
That I have had in hand.
9
I am ane Fische I am ane Eile,
Can steir my tongue and tail richt weill,
I give me to the mekill Deill,
Gif onie can do mair:
I can with fair anis fleitch and flatter,
And win ane Crown bot with ane clatter,
That gars me drink good wine for watter,
Suppois my back ga bair.
The Macrell intends to allure the Madyn. 10
God blis ow Maistres with our Buik,
Leise me they lips that I on luik:
I hope in God to sie ow bruik,
Ane nobill house at hame:
I ken ane Man into this town,
Of highest honor and renoun,
That wald be glaid to give his Gown,
For to have ow his Dame.

Emily. 11
Now be my saull I can not lie,
That their sik vertew is in me,
Gudwyfe, I pray ow quhat is he,
That man quhome of e meine?

Macrell Philotus is the man a faith,
Ane ground-riche man and full of graith:
He wantis na jewels claith nor waith,
Bot is both big and beine.
21
Weill war the woman all her life,
Had hap to be his weddit wife,
Scho micht have gold and geir als ryfe,
As Copper in her Rist:
^^, no^^ a Lady in all this Land,
I wait micht have mair wealth in hand,
Nor m^t have mair at her command,
To do with quhat scho list.
13
Fair flower, now sen e may him fang,
It war not good to let him gang,
Unto our self e'ile ^o greit wrang,
Sweit heart now and e sl^p him:
Now their is twenty i^^o this town,
Of greitest riches and renoun,
That wald be glaid for to sit down,
Upon their kneis to grip him.
14
Thocht he be auid my joy, quhat reek,
Quhen he is gave give him ane geek,
And tak another be the neck,
Quhen e the graith have gottin:
Schaw me our mind and quhat e meine,
I fall conuoy all this sa clein^,
That me ee fall esteem ane freine,
Q^^en I am deid and rottin.

Emilie. 15
I grant gude-wyfe he is richt good,
Ane man of wealth and nobill blude,
Bot hes mair uniter of ane Hude,
And Mittanes till his handis:
Nor of ane bairnelie Less like me,
Mair meit his Oy nor wife to be:
His age and mine cannot agrie,
Quhill that the world standis.

Macrell. 16
Let that allane he is not sa auld,
Nor it of curage half sa called,
Bot gif e war his wife, e wald,
Be weill aneuch concent:
With him mair treitment on ane day,
And get mair making off e may,
Nor with ane Wamster suith to say,
Quhen twenty eiris ar spent.
17
e neither mell with lad nor loun,
Bot with the best in all this town,
His wife may ay sit formest down,
At either burde or bink:
Gang formest in at dure or et,
And ay the first gude-day wald get,
With all men honourit and weill tret,
As onie heart wald think.
18
Se quhat a woman's mind may meise
And heir quhat honor, wealth and eise,
e may get with him and e pleise,
To do as I deuyse:
our fire sall first be birnand cleir,
our Madynis than sall have our geir,
Put in good or dour and effeir,
Ilk morning or ow rise.
19
And say, lo Maistres heir our Muillis,
Put on our Wylicote for it cuillis,
Lo, heir ane of our Veluote stuillis,
Quhairon e sall sit down:
Than twasum cummis to cambe our hair,
Put on our heidgeir soft and fair,
Tak their our glass sie all be clair,
And sa gais on our Goun.
20
Than tak to stanchethe morning drouth.

For fame cast sucker in at fouth,
Togidder with a Toist:
Thrie Garden gowps tak of the Air,
And bid our Page in haist prepair,
For our Disione sum dainty fair,
And cair not for na coist.
21
Ane pair of Pleuaris pypping hait,
Ane Pertrick and ane Quailie get,
Ane cup of Sack, sweit and weill set,
May for ane breckfast gain.
our Cater he may cair for syne,
Su undelicate agane e dyne,
our Cuke to seasoun all sa fine,
Than dois employ his pain.
22
To sie our servants may e gang,
And luke our Madynis all amang,
And gif their onie wark be wrang,
Than bitterne them blame,
Than may e have both Quaiffis and Kellis,
Hich Candie Ruffes and Barlet Bellis,
All for our weiring and not ellis,
Maid in our house at hame.
23
And now quhen all their warks is done,
For our refresching eftern one,
Gar bring unto our chalmer sone,
Sum danitie dische of meat:
Ane cup or two with Muscadall,
Sum other licht thing thairwithall,
For Rasins or for Capers call,
Gif that e please to eat,
24
Till suppertyme then may e chois,
Unto our Garden to repois,
Or merely to tak ane glois,
Or tak ane buke and reid on:
Syne to our supper ar e brocht,
Till fair full far that hes been socht,
And dainty disches deirlie bocht,
That Ladies loves to feid on.
25
The Organes than into our hall,
With Schalme and Tymbrell sound they sall,
The Vyole and the Lute with all,
To gar our meat digest:
The supper done than up e rise,
To gang ane quhyle as is the gyfe,
Be e have rowmit ane Alley thryse,
It is ane mile almaist.
26
Than may e to our Chalmer gang,

With talk and merry mowes amang,
To eleuate the spleen:
For our Collation tak and taist,
Sum lytill licht thing till digest,
At nicht use Rense wine ay almaist,
For it is could and clean.
27
And for our back I dar be bold,
That e fall weir even as e would,
With doubill Garnischings of gould,
And Craip above our hair:
our Veluote hat, our Hude of Stait,
our Myssell quhen e gang to gait,
Fra Sone and wind both air and lait.
To keip that face safair.
28
Of Pareis wark wrocht by the laif,

For to decoir ane Carkat craif
That cumlie Color bane:
our greit gould Cheinzie for our neck,
Be bowsum to the Carle and beck,
For he hes gould aneuch, quhat reck?
It will not stand on nane.
29
And for our Gowns ay the new guyse,

To have them louse with plets and plyis,
Or clasped clois behind:
The stuff my heart e neid not haine,
Pan Veluot, raysde figurit or plain,
Silk, Satyne, Damayse or Grograine,
The fynest e can find.
30
our claithes on cullouris cuttit out,
And all Pasmentit round about,
My blessing on that semelie snout,
Sa weill I trow sall set them:

our borderit Wylicote abone,
As e deuyse all sall be done,
Vncraifit quhen e get them.
31

Gould bracelets and all other things,
And all our fingers full of Rings,
With Pearl and precious stanes:

Rickillis of gould and jewellis jo,
Quhat reck to tak the Bogill-bo,

Thairfoir sweit honey I ow pray,
Tak tent in time and nocht delay,
Sweit sucker, neck me not with nay,
Bot be content to tak him.

Pleasant. 33
The devil cum lick that beird auld rowan
Now sie the trottibus and trowane,
Sa busily as sho is wowane,
Sie as the carling craks:
Begyle the barn sho is bot oung,
Foull fall they lips, God nor that tongue,
War doubill gilt with Nurisch doung,
And ill cheir on they cheikis.

Emily. 33
Gude-wyfe all is bot good I heir,
For weill I lufe to make good cheir,
For honouris, gould, and other geir,
They can not be refusit:
I grant indeid, my daily fair,
Will be sufficient and mair,
Bot be it good e do not spair,
As royally to ruse it.
35
I grant all day to be weill tret,
Honors anew and hicht vpset,
Bot quhat intreatment sall I get,
I pray ow in my bed?
Bot with ane lairbair for to ly,
Ane auld deid stock, both cauld and dry,
And all my days heir I deny,
That he my schankes sched,
36
His eine half sunkin in his heid,
His Lyre far caulder than the leid,
His frostie flesch as he war deid,
Will for na happing heit:
Vnhealthsum hosting ever mair,
His filthsum flewme is nathing fair,
Ay rumisching with rift and rair,
Now, wow gif that be sweit,
37.
His skin hard clappit to the bane,
With Gut and Gravel both ouirgane,
Now quhen their troubles hes him taken,
His wife gets all the wit:
For Venus gains I let them ga,
I guess he be not good of they,
I could weill of his manners ma,
Gif I list till indyte.

Macrell. 38
For Venus game cure not a cuit,
Waill me ane Wamfler that can do' it,
Sen their may be na other buit,
Plat on his head ane horn:
Handill me that with wit and skill,
e may have easments at our will,
At nicht gar oung men cum ow till,
Put them away at morn.

Emily. 39
Gude-wyfe, all is bot vain e seik,
To me of sik matters to speik,
our purpois is not worth ane leik,
I will heir ow na mair:
Mark Dame, and this is all and sum,
If ever e this earand cum,
Or of our head I heir ane mum,
ea sall repent it fair.

Macrell. 40
on dainty Dame scho is sa nyce
Sche'ill nocht be win be na deuyce,
For nouther prayer nor for price,
For gould nor other gain.
Scho is sa ackwart and sa thra,
That with refuse I come her fra,
Scho, be Sanct Marie saynde me sa,
I dar not ga agane,
Philotus enteris in conference with the Madynis father. 41.
Good Gosse, sen e have ever been,
My true and auld familiar friend,
To make mair quentance us between,
I glaidly could agrie:
e have ane douchter quhome until,
I bear ane passing grit good will,
Quhais Phisnomie prefigures skill,
With wit and honesty.
42
Gif me that Less to be my wife,
For Tocher-gude sall be na strife,
Believe me scho sall have ane life,
And for our geir I cair not:
Faith e our self sall modifie,
Her Life, Rent, Land and Coniunct fie,
And Gossop, quhair they same sall be,
Appoint the place and spair not.
43
Betwixt us two the Heyris-maill,
Sall bruik my heritage all haill,
Quhilks gif that they happen to faill,
To her Heyris quhat saeuer:
My moueables I will deuyde,
Ane pairt my Douchter to provide,
Ane pairt to leave sum friend aside,
Quhen deith sall us disseuer.

Alberto. 44
Good sir, and gossop I am glaid,
That all be done as e have said,
Tak both my blissing and the Maid,
Hame to our house togidder:
And gif that scho play not her pairt,
In onie lawful honest airt,
And honor ow with all her hairt,
I wald sho gaid not thither.
Alberto speiks to his Dochter. 45
For the ane man I have foreseine,
Ane man of micht and wealth I meine,
That staitlier may the sustain,
Nor any of all thy kin:
Ane man of honor and renoun,
Ane of the Potentes of the town:
Quhair nane may beinlier sit down,
This City all within.

Emily. 46
God and good nature dois allow,
That I obedient be to ow,
And father hithertils I trow,
e have nane vtherseine:
And als estemis ow for to be,
Ane loving father unto me,
Thairfoir deir father let me see,
The man of quhome e meine.

Alberto. 47
Philotus is the man indeid,
Quhair thou ane nobill life may leid,
With quhome I did sa far proceid,
We want bot thy good will:
Now give thy fry consent thairfoir,
Deck up and do thy self decoir,
Gang quickly to and say no moir,
Thou man agrie thairtill.

Emilie. 48
Gif e fra fury wald refrain,
And patiently heir me agane,
I sold ow schaw in termis plane,
With reason ane excuse:
Sen Marriage been but thraldom free,
God and good nature dois agree,
That I quhair as it lykes not me,
May lawfully refuse.
49
I am fourtene, and he fourescoir,
I haill and sound, he seik and soir,
How can I give consent thairfoir,
Or it till him agree?
Judge gif Philotus be discreit,
To seik ane match sa far vnmeit,
Thocht I refuse him father sweit,
I pray ow pardon nice.

Alberto. 50
How durst thou trumper be sa bald
To rant or tell, that he was ald?
Or durst refuse ocht that I wald,
Have bidden the obey:
Bot sen e stand sa lytill aw,
Ise gar ow Maistres for to know,
The Impyre Parents hes belaw,
Abuif their Children ay.
51
And heir to God I make ane vow,
Bot gif thou at my bidding bow,
I sall the dress and harkin how,
And syne advise the better:
I sall thee cast intill ane pit,
Quhair thou for eir and day sall sit,
With breid and water surely knit
Hard boundintill ane fetter.
52
Thou sat sa soft upon thy stuill.
That making off maid the ane fuill,
Bot I sall make thy curage evil,
For all thy stomach stout:
That efterwards quhill that thou leif,
Thou's be aghast me for to grief.
Perchance thou greines that play to preif,
Advise thee and speik out.

Emily. 53
Sweit father, mitigate our rage,
our wraith and anger sir, assuage,
Have pity on my outhlie age,
our a win flesch and our blude:
Gif in our ire I be ouerthrawin.
Quhome have e wraikit bot our awin,
Sik creweltie hes not been knawin,
Amang the Turks sa rude.
54
The savage beists into their kind,
Their oung to pity ar inclynde,
Let mercy thairfoir muif our mind,
To her that humbly cryis:
Tak up and lenifie our ire,
Suspend the fury of our fire.
And grant me layser, I desire,
Ane lytill to advise.

Heir followis the Oratioun of the onker Flavius to the Madyn, her answer and
consent, The convoying of her from her father: her father and the auld wower
follow is, and finds Philerno the Madyns brother laitlie arrived, quhome they
tak to be the Madyn, and of his deceit. THe raging low, the feirce and flaming
fire
That dois my breist and body al combure
Iucendit with the dart of grit desire,
Fra force of these two sparking eyis full sure,
Hes me constraynit to cum and seik my cure
Of her, fra quhom proceidit hes my wound,
Quhom neither Salve nor Syrop can assure,
Bot only sho can make me saif and sound.
56
Like as the captive with ane tyrant taine,
Perforce with promise toistit to and fro,
Quhen that he seis all other graces gain,
Man succor seik of him that wrocht his woe,
Samon I fald to my may freindly fo,
To seik for salve of her that gave the sair:
To pray for peace, thocht rigor bid me go,
To cry for mercy, quhen as I may na mair.
57
Sa sen e have me captiuate as thrall,
Sen e preuaill, let pity now have place:
Have mercy sen e Maistres ar of all,
Grudge not to grant our supplicant sum grace
To slay ane taine man, war bot lack allace,
Fra that he cum voluntarlie in will:
Sen I am, Mistres, in the self same case,
Ane thrall consenting pity war to spill.
58
Quhat ferly thocht, puir I with luif oppressed
Confess the force of the blind Archer Boy?
How was Appollo for his Daphne dressed,
And Mars amasit his Venus to enjoy,
Did not the thundering Jupiter convoy
For Danae him self into ane shower,
The gods above sen luif has maid them coy,
Unto his law then quhy sold I not lowre?
59
As taine with ane nor Daphne mair decoir
Quhais vult to Venus may compairit be:
And been in beauty Danae befoir.
Suppose the God on her did cast his eye:
Quhais graces to her beauty dois agrie,
And in quhais fairnes is no folly found,
Quhat meruell Mistres than, suppose e se,
With willing band me to our beauty bound.
60
Quhais bricht containing beauty with the beamis
Na les al other pulchritude dois pas
Nor to compair ane clud with glansing gleames,
Bricht Venus color with ane landwart las:
The quhytest layke bot with the blackest ass,
The rubent Rois bot with the wallowit weid
As purest gold is preciouser nor glass,
our beauty sa all other dois exceid.
61
our hair lyk gold, and like the Pole our eye
our snawisch cheiks like quhytest Allabast,
our louesum lips sad, soft, and sweit we sie,
As Roses red quhen that ane shower is past:
our tongue micht make Demosthenes aghast,
our teith ye peirls micht of their place depryue
With Bwillis of Indian Ebur at the last
our Papis for the prioritie dois strive.
62
And like as quhen the stamping seal is set
In wax weill wrocht, quhill it is soft I say,
The prent thairof remaining may e get,
Suppois the seal it self be taken away,
our semlie shaip sa sall abide for ay,
Quhilk throw the sicht my sensis hes ressaifit,
Thocht absent e, it I sall nicht and day,
our presence have as in my heart ingraifit.
63
Thocht fancy be bot of ane figure fainit,
Na figure feids quhair their is na effect:
Euin sa sweit saull I perisch bot as painit,
With fancy fed that will na fasting breck,
Suppois I have the accident quhat reck,
Grant me the solid substance to atteine,
Gif not, quhen e to deith sall me direct,
Quhom bot our awin have e co^foundit clein?
64
Last, sen e may my meladie remeid,
Releive our Sysiphus of his restles stane:
our Titius breist that dois full ryfely bleid,
Grant grace thairto, befoir the grip be gane,
Cum stanche the thrist of Tantalus anon,
And cure ye wounds geuin with Achilles knyfe
Accept for ours fair Maistres, such a one,
That for our saik dar sacrifice his life.

Emily. 65
OUR Orisoun sir sounds with sic skill
In Cupids Court as e had been vpbrocht:
Or fosterit in Parnassus forkit Hill
Quhair Poetis hes their flame and fury socht
Nocht taisting of sweit Helicon for nocht,
As be our pleasant preface dois appeir:
Tending thairby, quhill as we have na thocht,
To make us to our purpois to adheir.
66
With loving language tending till allure,
With sweit discourse the simpill till ouirsyle,
e cast our craft, our cunning and our cure,
Bot puir Orphans and Madynis to begyle,
our waillit out words, inventit for a wyle,
To trap all those that trowis in ow na train
The fruit of flattrie is bot to defyle,
And spread that we can never get agane.
67
e gar us trow that all our heids be cowit,
In praising of our beauty by the Skyis:
Quhe^ with our words we are na mair bot mowit
This way to sie gif us e may suppryse,
our doubill heart dois every day deuyse,
Ane thousand shifts was never in our thocht,
e labor thus with all that in ow lyis,
For till undo, and bring us all to nocht.
68
And this conceate is common to ow all,
For our awin lust, e set not by our schame,
our sweitest word, ar seasonit all with gall,
our fairest phrase, disfigures bot defame,
I think thairfoir they gritlie ar to blame,
That trowis in ow mair nor the thing they se
Bot I, quhill that Emilia is my Name
To trow I sall like to Sanct Thomas be.

Flavius. 69
For feir sweit maistres quhat remeid
Quha may persuade quhair their is dreid:
it deem e wrangouslie in deid,
Now be my saull I sweir:
our honor, not our schame I seik,
I count not by my lust ane leik,
It was na sik thing Maistres meik,
That maid me to cum heir.
70
This is my suit e sall me trust,
Judge e our self gif it be just,
In honest luif and honest lust,
With ow to leid my life:
This is the treuth of my intent,
In lawful lufe bot only bent,
Advise ow gif e can consent,
To be my weddit wife.

Emily. 71
Sir surely gif I understood,
our meining for to be as good,
I think in ane we sold conclude,
Befoir that it were lang:
I am content to be our wife,
To lufe and serve ow all my life,
Bot rather slay me with a knyfe,
Nor offer me ane wrang.
72
Bot sir, ane thing I have to say,
My father hes this other day,
In Marriage promisit me away,
Upon ane deid auld man:
With quhome thocht I be not content,
Till nane other he will consent,
Make to thairfoir for till invent
Ane convoy, gif ow can.
73
Lykewayis ow mon first to me sweir,
That e to me sall do na deir,
Nor sall not cum my body neir,
For villainy nor ill:
Ay quhill the Nuptial day sall stand,
And farther sir, gif me our hand,
With me for to compleit the band,
And promeis to fulfill.

Flavius. 74
Have their my hand with all my heart
And faithful promeis for my part,
Na time to change quhill deithis dart,
Put till my life ane end:
Bot be ane Husband traist and true,
For na suspect that anis sall rue,
Bot ready ay to do my dew,
And never till offend.

Emily. 75
All day quhairto the tr^^th to tell,
I dar nocht with that matter mel,
Bot it I sall deuyse my sell,
Ane schift to serve our turn:
For keiping stairt both lait and air,
Vnsend-furth may I never fair,
Make I ane mint and do na mair,
I may for ever murne.
76
Quhen I have vnbethocht me thryse,
I can na better way deuyse,
Bot that I man me disagyse,
In habit of ane man:
Thus I but danger or but dout,
This business may bring about,
In man's array unkind pas out,
For ocht my keipars can.
77
Thairfoir e sall gang and provide,
Ane Pages claithis in the meine tide,
For all occasions me beside,
Against I have ado:
Let me euin as they list me call,
Or quhat sumeuer me befall,
I hope within thrie dayis I sall,
Cum quyetly ow to.

Flavius. 78
Be my awin meins I sall atteine,
And send to ow they claithis unseen,
Convoy lat sie all things sa cleine,
That never nane suspeck:
I will wait on my self and meit ow,
To se our new claiths as they set ow,
The Carle that hecht sa weill to treit ow,
I think sall get ane geck.

Emilie. 79
I have won narrowly away,
on Carle half put me in effray,
He lay in wait and waiting ay,
In changing aff my claithis:
Sir, let us ga out of his sicht,
Sen I am fry, my friend gude-nicht,
He lukis as all things war not richt,
Lo onder quhair he gais.

Flavius. 80
My only luif and Lady quhyte,
My darling deir and my delight,
How sall I ever the requyte,
This grit good will let see:
That but respect that men callis schame,
Nor haart of thy awin good name,
For brute, for blasphemy nor blame,
Hes venterit all for me.

Stephano Albertus Servant. 81
Master full far I have ow socht,
And full ill news I have ow brocht,
The thing allace, I never thocht,
Hes happinnit ow this day:
our douchter sir (e had bot ane)
Ane mannis claithis hes on her taken,
And quyetlie hes her earand gave,
I can not tell quhat way.
82
I wonderit first and was aghast,
Bot quhen I saw that sho was past,
I followit after wonder fast,
it was I not the better:
Scho schiftit hes her self aside,
And in sum house sho did her hyde,
Na sir, quhat ever sall betyde,
It will be hard to get her.

Alberto. 83
Falls pewtene hes scho play it that sport
Hes scho me handlit in this sort?
To God I vow cum I athort,
And lay on her my handis:
I sall her ane exampill make,
To trumpers all durst undertake,
For to commit sa foull ane fack,
Quhill that this City standis.
84
Vylde vagabound falls harlot hure,
Had sho na schame, tuke sho na cure,
Of Parentis that her gat and bure,
Nor blude of quhilk sho sprang:
All honest beauty to dispyse,
And like ane man her disagyse,
Vnwomanlie in sik ane wise,
As gudget for to gang.
85
Falls mischant, full of all mischief,
Dissaitfull traitor, commoun theif,
Of all thy kin curit not the grief,
For fleschly foull delight:
Quha sall into sik trumpers trust?
Quhais wickit wayis ar sa unjust,
And led with lewd licentious lust,
And beastly appetyte.

Philotus. 86
O sex uncertain, frail and falls,
Dissimulate and dissaitfull als,
With honey lips to hald in hals,
Bot with ane wickit mind:
Quhome will dois mair nor reasoun mufe,
Mair lechery nor honest lufe,
Mair harlotrie nor good behufe,
Unconstant and unkind.
87
In quhome ane shaw, bot na shame sinks,
That ane thing sayis and other thinks:
Ane eye lukis up, ane other winks,
With fair and feine it face:
Bot Gossop go, quhill it is greine,
For to seik out quha hes her seine,
Gif of her moyen we get ane meine,
It war ane happy grace.

Philerno. 88
Good sirs is nane of ow can tell,
In quhat streit dois Alberto dwell,
Or be quhat singe I Will know my sell,
Good brethren all about:
For thocht I be his Sone and Heir,
I know him not a myte the mair,
And to this Town dois now repair,
My father to find out.

Alberto. 89
ea harlote, trowit thou for to skip
Sen I have gottin of the ane grip,
Be Christ I sall thy nurture nip,
Richt scharply or we sched:
For God nor I rax in ane raip,
And ever thou fra my hand escaip,
Quhill I have pullit the like ane Paip,
Quhair nane sall be to red.

Philotus. 90
Rage not good gosse, bot hald our tongue
The las bot bairnlie is and oung,
I wald be laith to wit her dung,
Suppose scho has offendit:
Forgive her this ane fault for me,
And I sall souertie for her be,
That instantly sho sall agree,
That this slip sold be mendit.

Philerno 91
Father I grant my haill offense,
Their claithes I have taken till ga hence,
And gif it please ow till dispense,
With their things that are past:
Their bygane faults will e forgive,
And after father quhili I live,
Agane I sall ow never greiue,
Quhill that my life may last.
92
Schaw me the manner and the way,
And I our bidding sall obey,
And never sall our will gane say,
Bot be at our command:

Alberto. This fault heir frelie I forgive thee,
Philotus is the man releiues thee,
Or vtherwayis I had mischeifit thee,
And now give me thy hand.
93
This is my ordinance and will,
Give thy consent Philotus till,
To marie him and to fulfill,
That godly blissit band:

Philerno. Father, I hartlie am content,
And heirto gives my full consent,
For it richt fair wald me repent,
Gif I sold ow gainstand.

Philotus. 94
Heir is my hand my darling dow,
To be ane faithful spous to ow,
Now be my saull Gossop I trow,
This is ane happy meiting:
This matter Gosse, is sa weill dressed,
That all things ar cumde for the best,
Bot let us set amang the rest,
Ane day for all compleiting.

Alberto. 95
Ane Month and na langer day,
For it requyres na grit delay,
Tak their our wife with ow away,
And use her as e will:

Philotus. Forsooth e sall ga with me hame,
Quhair I sall keip ow saif fra schame,
Unto the day, or than me blame,
That scho sall have nane ill.

Pleasant. 96
Quha ever saw in all their life,
Two cappit Cairlis make sik ane strife,
To tak a oung man for his wife,
on cadgell wald be glaid:
The feind resaue the feckles frunt,
Put down thy hand and graip her cunt,
The Carle kennis not, he is sa blunt,
Gif scho be man or maid.
97
Auld guckis the mundie, sho is a gillie,
Scho is a Colt-foill, not a fillie,
Scho wants a dow, bot hes a pillie,
That will play the ane pass:
Put down thy hand vane Carle and graip,
As they had wont to cheis the Paip,
For thou hes gotten ane joke jaip,
In lykenes of ane Less.

Philotus speiks to his Dochter Brisila. 98
Brisilla Dochter mine give eir,
A Mother I have brocht the heir,
To me a wife and darling deir,

Her honor, serve, obey and luif,
Wirk ay the best for her behuif,
To pleis her sie thy pairt thou pruif,
With wit and all devoit.
Philotus to his new Bryde. 99
Use her even as our awin my dow,
Keip her, for sho sall ly with ow,
Quhill I may lawfully avow,
To lay ow be my side:

Philerno. I sall our dochter Husband sweit,
Na les nor my companeoun treit,
And follow both at bed and meit,
Quhill that I be ane bryde.
Philerno to Brisilla. 100
How dois the quheill of Fortoun go,
Quhat wickit weird hes wrocht our woe?
Brisilla ouris and mine also,
Unhappily, I say:
Our fathers both hes done agrie,
That I to ouris, euin as e sie,
And e to mine sall maryit be,
And all upon ane day.
101
Hard is our hap and luckles chance.
Quha pities us suppose we pance?
Full often this matter did I skance,
Bot with my self befoir:
I have been threatnit and forflittin,
Sa often that I am with it bittin,
Invent a way or it be wittin,
And remedy thairfoir.

Brisilla. 120
Maistres allace for sik remeid,
That sik ane purpois sold proceid,
I wald wisch rather to be deid,
Nor in that manner matchit:
Quhat aillit e Parents to prepair.
our Childrens deip continual cair,
our crewell hands quhy did e spair,
First us to have dispatchit.
103
Unnatural fathers now quhairfoir?
Wald e our dochters thus deuoir?
For our vane fantasies far moir,
Nor onie good respeck:
Is it not doittrie hes ow dreuin,
Haiknayis to seik for haist to Heauin?
I trow that all the world euin,
Sall at our guckrie geck.
104
Solace to seik them selves to sla,
Ane mire to miss they fall in ma:
They get bot grief quhen as they ga,
To get their greitest game:
And we oung things tormentit to,
Their daffing dois us swa undo,
Gif they be wise, their doings lo,
Will signify the same.

Philerno. 105
It profeitis not for to compleine,
Let us forsie our selves between,
How we this perrell may preueine,
And saif us fra their snairis:
Gif that the Gods, as they weill can,
Wald me transform intill ane man,
We two our selves sold marie than,
And saif us fra their cairis,

Brisilla. 106
Make ow a man, that is bot mowis
To think thairon our grief bot growis,
For that deuyse devil haid it dowis,
Sen it can never be:

Philerno. Quhy not? gif that with faith we pray
For often the Gods as I hard say,
Hes done the like and it they may,
Perchance till us agrie.
107
That Iphis was a Maid we reid,
And swa did for her prayer speid,
For very reuth the Gods indeid,
Transformde her in ane man:
Pigmaleons prayer purchased life,
Unto his new eburneall wife,
Quhais handis had caruit her with ane knyfe,
With visage paill and wan.
108
Quhy may not now als weill as than,
The Gods convert me in ane man,
The like gif that my prayer can,
I surely will assay:
May secreit Gods Celestial,
e michtie Muifers greit and small,
And Heauinlie powers ane and all,
May humbly I ow pray,
109
Luke down from our impyre above,
And from our heich triumphant Trone,
Till us puir saullis send succor sone,
Of our may special grace:
Behald how we puir Madynis murne,
For feir and luif how both we burn,
Thairfoir intill ane man me turn,
For till eschew this case.
110
Behald our Parents hes oppressed,
And by all dew their Dochters dressed,
With vnmeit matches to molest,
Us silly saullis e sie:
Thairfoir immortal Gods of grace,
Grant that our prayeris may tak place,
Convert my kind, this cairfull case,
With solace to supply.

Pleasant. 111
Ane faith perfumit with fine folly,
And money vane word alla-volie,
Thy prayer is not halfsa holy,
House-lurdane as it semis:
Bot all inventit for a wyle,
Thy bedfallow for to begyle,
The bonie Less bot to defyle,
Na dowbilnes that demes.

Brisilla. 112
Maistris quhat now? bethink ye dreme.
Or than to be in sown e seime:
Scho lyis als deid, quhat sall I deime,
Of this unhappy chance?
Scho will not heir me for na cryis,
For plucking on scho will not ryis,
Sa larbair-lyke lo as scho lyis,
As raueist in a trance.

Philerno. 113
O blisfull Deitis divine,
May happy convent, Court and Tryne,
That dois our glorious eiris inclyne,
Our prayeris to adheir:
We rander thanks unto ow all,
For heiring us quhen that we call,
And ridding us from bondage thrall,
As plainly dois appeir.
114
I am ane man Brisilla lo,
And with all necessaris thairto,
May all that onie man may do,
I sall gar ow considder:
Now sen the Goddis abone hes brocht,
This wondrous wark, and hes it wrocht,
And grantit all euin as we socht,
Let us be glaid togidder.

Brisilla. 115
Now sen the Gods hes succor sent
And done even as we did invent,
My joy I hartly am content,
To do as e deuyse:
Throw Gods decreit my only choice,
In mutual luif we sall rejoyse,
Our furious fathers both suppose
They wald skip in the Skyis.

Philotus. 116
My dow suppois I did delay,
Now cum is our sweit Nuptial day,
Thairfoir make haist sooa that we may,
In time cum to the Kirk:

Philerno Ga quhen e list sir, I am ready,
Their is ane Gus-heid, for be our Lady,
I was our Sone, and e my Dadie,
This morning in the mirk.

Minister. 117
I dout not bot e understand,
How God is Author of this band,
And the actioun that we have in hand,
He did himself out set:
To that effect all men I meine,
Micht keip their bodies puir and cleine,
Fra Fornication till abstain,
And Children to beget.
118
Bot sen the matter cums athort,
Ilk other day, I will be schort,
And dois the parties both exhort,
To charity and luif:
Tak heir this woman for your wife,
Keip, luif and cherisch her but strife,
All other als term of your life,
Saif her e sall remuif.
119
Tak for our Spous Philotus than,
Obey and luif him as e can,
Forsaik for him all other man,
Quhill deith do ow disseuer:
The Lord to sanctify and bless ow,
His grace and favor als I wisch ow,
Let not his luif and mercy miss ow,
Bot be with ow for ever.

Flavius conjuration. 120
O mercy God, how may this be?
on is indeid richt Emilie,
In form of her a faith I sie,
Sum Devil hes me desaifit:
I will in haist thairfoir gang hame,
Expel on Spreit for sin and schame,
And to tell me the awin richt Name,
For Gods cause I will craif it.
121
The Croce of God our Savior sweit,
To saif and sane me fra that Spreit,
That thou na hap have for to meit,
With me in all thy life:
In Gods behalf I charge the heir,
That thou straik in my heart na feir,
Bot pas thy way and do na deir,
To neither man nor wife.
122
First I conjure the be Sanct Marie,
Be Alrisch King and Queen of Farie,
And be the Trinity to tarry,
Quhill thou the treuth have taull:
Be Christ and his Apostilles twell;
Be Sanctis of Heuin and hewis of Hell,
Be auld Sanct Tustian him sell,
Be Peter and be Paull.
123
Be Matthew, Mark, be Luik and Iohne,
Be Lethe, Stir and Acherone,
Be hellishe faries every one,
Quhair Pluto is the Prince:
That thou depart and do na wonder,
Be lichtning, quhirle wind, hayle nor thunder,
That beast nor body get na blunder,
Nor harm quhen thou gais hence.
124
Throw power I charge the of the Paip,
Thou neither girne, gowl, glowme, nor gaip,
Like Anchor saidell like vnsell Aip,
Like Owl nor Alrische Elfe:
Like fyrie Dragon full of feir,
Like Warwolf, Lion, Bull nor Beir,
Bot pas ow hence as thou come heir,
In lykenes of thy self.

Emily. 125
Gude-man quhat meine e ocht bot good
Quha hes ow put in sik ane mude?
Befoir I never understood,
The form of our conjuring:

Flarius. I charge the it as of befoir,
Pas hence and troubill me no moir,
Trowis thou to draw me ouir the scoir,
Falls feind with thy alluring.

Emily. 126
Gude-man quhat misteris all their mowis?
As e war cumbred with the cowis,
e ac I think like Iohne of Lowis,
Or ane out of his mind:

Flavius. In Gods behalf I the beseiche,
Impesche me not with word nor speiche,
Ill Spreit, to God I me beteiche,
Fra the and al thy kind.

Pleasant. 127
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha,
The feind resaue the lachters a,
Quhilk is the wysest of us two,
Man quhidder thou or I?
Flemit fuill, hes thou not tint thy feill,
That takis thy wife to be ane Deill,
Thou is far vainest I wait weill,
Speir at the standers by.

Flavius. 128
I charge the it as I have ellis,
Be halie relickis, Beidis and Bellis,
Be Ermeitis that in desertis dwellis,
Be Lumitoris and Tarlochis:
Besweit Sanct Steuin stanit to the deid,
And be Sanct Iohne his halie heid,
Be Merling, Rymour and be Beid,
Be witchis and be warlochis.
129
Be Sanct Maloy, be Moses Rod,
Be Mahomeit the Turkisch God,
Be Julian and Sanct Elous nod,
Be Bernard and be Bryde:
Be Michaell that the Dragon dang,
Be Gabriell and his auld sang,
Be Raphaell in time of thrang,
That is to be as gyde.

Emily. 130
My luif, I think it very like,
That e war Licht or Lunatyke,
e feir, e fray, e fidge, e fyke,
As with a Spreit possessed:
Quhat is the matter that e mean?
Quhat garris ow braid? quhair have e been?
Quhat aillis ow joy? quhat have e seen?
To rage with sik unrest.

Flavius. 131
Quhat have I seen falls hound of Hell
I trowit quhen I did with the mell,
Thou was richt Emilie thy sell,
Not ane incarnate Devil:
Bot I richt now with my awin Eine,
Richt Emilie have maryit seine,
Sa thou mon be ane Spreit vncleine,
Lord saif me fra thy evil.
132
Be vertew of the halie Ghaist,
Depairt out of mine house in haist,
And God quhais power and micht is may,
Conserve me fra thy cummer:
Gang hence to Hell or to the Farie,
With me thou may na langer tarry,
For quhy? I sweir the be Sanct Marie,
Thows be nane of my nummer.

Philerno. 133
Gar wsche this house for it grows lait
Husband I have for to debait,
With ow a lytill of estait,
Befoir we go to bed:
Sen I am oung and e ar auld,

A faith defoir we sched.

Philotus, 134
We will not for the maistrie stryne,
We mon grie better and we thryue,

Philerno. Na be my saull we is wit belyue,
Quha gets the upper hand:
Indeid thou sall beir me a beuell,
For with my Neiues I sall the navel,
Auld custrone Carle tak their a revel,
Than do as I command.

Philotus. 135
I sie it cummis to cuffis the man,
Ileend the play that thou began,
That victory thou never wan,
That sall be bocht sa deir:
Ha mercy, mercy Emilie,
Tak e the maistrie all for me,
For I sall at our bidding be,
And slay me not I sweir.

Pleasant. 136
Well clappit burd quhan will e kiss?
Auld fuill, the feind resaue the miss,

To have ane of their Maggies:
Quhat think e now? how is the case,
Now e'ill all doit, allace, allace,
Now grace and honor on that face,
Quod Robein to the Haggies.

Philerno. 137
Than hecht in haist thairfoir that thou
Sall ready at my bidding bow,
Quhat ever I do thou sall allow,
My fancy to fulfill:
Sa gang I out, sa cum I in,
Sa gif I waist, sa gif I win,
Quhat ever I do make e na din,
Bot let me wirk my will.
138
Thou may not speir the cause, and quhy,
Quhen that I list not with ow ly,
Quhat I the did, and thou deny,
We will not weill agrie:
Quhen that I pleis forth to repair
Speir not the cumpanie, nor quhair:
Content thy self and make na mair.

Philotus. 139
I am content quhen and how sone,
All till obey that e inione,
That e command it man be done
Their is nane other buit:

Philerno. Quhat is our price Damesall fair?
Quhat tak e for a nichts lair?

Huir. e sall a Croun upon me spair,
Bot quhom with sal I do it?

Philerno. 140
I Will get a man, have heir a Croun,
Bot be weill strange quhen ely down,
Make nyce and gar the Larbair lowne,
Believe e be a Maid:

Huir. The oungest Las in all this City,
Sall bide na mair requeist nor treitie,
I Will cry as I war huirt for pity,
Quhen I am with him laid.

Emily. 141
Now sen my Husband hes done la
But cause for to put me him fra,
I will unto my father ga,
Befoir his feit to faid:
Father sa far I did offend,
That I may not my mis amend,
And am ouir pert for to pretend
our dochter to be called.

Alberto. 142
Lament not, let that matter be,
Thy faltis ar buriet all with me.
Betwixt thy Husband now and thee,
Is onie new debait?

Emily. I know of nane, bot he indeid,
Hes put me fra him, quhat remeid?
And will na mair sik fosteris feid,
He sayis of mine estait?

Alberto. 143
Quhat is the matter that e meine
Against all ordour clair and cleine,
Schut hame our wife that hes not been,
it five days in our aucht:
Is this ane pleasant godly life,
To be in barrace, sturt and strife,
The feind wald feign man be our wife,
Can never sit in saucht.

Philotus. 144
Knew e the treuth gude-man I trow
Hirlabour e sold not allow,
Luke all my face, behald my brow,
That is both blak and bla:

Alberto. It may weill be, I can not tell,
That scho durst with that matter mell,
Let her make answer for her sell,
To sie gif it be sa.
145
Dochter gave I the this commend,
That thou thy Husband sold ganestand,
How durst thou Huir, him with thy hand,
Put to the point of felling?

Emily. That war grit wrang sir, gif sa be,
Bot he na Husband is to me,
Than how could we two disagree,
That never had na melling.

Alberto. 146
Na melling Mistress? will e than
Deny the Marriage of that man,
In face of holy Kirk quha can,
This open deid deny?

Emily. Let resoun sir with ow preuaill,
Condemn me not first in the faill,
Befoir that e have hard my taill,
The treuth syne may e try.
147
Now this is all that I wald say,
That Flavius tuke me away,
About a Month and a day,
Dressed in a Varlets weid:
With quhome I have been ever still,
Ane other Emilie ay and quhill,
He saw ow give Philotus till,
And than in very deid,
148
Supponing me ane Devil of Hell,
With crewell conjuratiounes fell,
Did me out of his house expel,
As with a Bogill bazed:
As ane out of his mind or marrit,
He hes me of his house debarrit,
I can not tell quhat hes him skarrit,
Or hes the man amazed*

Alberto. 149
This purpois gosse, appeirs to me
Sa wonder nyce and strange to be,
That we to wit the verity,
For Flavius man send:
Sir gif e could declair us now,
How lang this woman was with ow,
And all the manner quhen and how,
We wald richt gladly kend.

Flavius. 150
Sa far Alberto as I know,
I sell the suith unto ow schaw.
Quhen I our Douchters beauty I saw,
I offerit her gude-will:
Accepting than the promise maid,
Cled like a Boy but mair abaid,
Fra ow dissaitfullie scho slaid,
And come mine house until.
151
Quhair I her keipit as my wife,
Tret, luifit and chereist her for life,
Quhill efter-ward fell out ane strife,
Their matters all amang:
For plainly in the Kirk I saw,
This man became our Sone in law,
I did thairfoir perfytly know,
My Emilie was wrang.
152
And that some Spreit her schaip had taken
Sen Emilies their was bot ane,
I thairfoir to that Ghaist have gane,
Conjuring her my sell:
And fra my house expellit her to,
This woman seimis for to be scho,
Sensyne I had na mair ado,
With that falls feind of Hell.

Philotus. 153
Now Flavius, I wait richt well
Sen ane of them man be a Deill,
My maiglit face maks me to feill,
That mine man be the same:
For quhy? richt Emilie is ouris,
And that incarnate Devil is ouris,
I gat, e may sie be my clouris,
A Deill unto my Dame.

Philerno. 154
Heir I am cum to red the strife,
For I am neither Deill nor Wife,
Bot am ane oung man be my life,
our Sone sir, and our Air.
Quhome e for Emilie haif taken.
And wald not sirs let me allane,
Quhill e saw quhat gait it is gane,
I can tell ow na mair.

Philotus. 155
A man, allace, and harmisay,
That with my only Dochter lay,
Syne dang my sell, quhat sall I say?
Of this unhappy chance?
Have I not maid a berrie block,
That hes for Iennie maryit Iock?
That mowit my Dochter for a mock,
The Devil be at the dance.
156
Allace, I am for ever schamit,
To be thus in my eild defamit,
My Dochter is not to be blamit,
For I had all the wit:
Auld men is twyse bairnis, I persaif,
The wysest will in wowing raif,
I for my labor with the laif,
Am driuin to this dispyte.

Alberto. 157
Good gosse our wraith to pacify
Sen that their may na better be,
I am content my Sone that he,
Sall with our Dochter Marie:

Philerno. I am content with heart and will,
This Marriage father to fulfill,
Quhat neidis Philotus to think ill,
Or it his weird to wary.

Flavius. 158
Be frolic Flavius and feign,
To get thy Emilie again
To deem my dow, was I not vain,
That thou had been a Spreit
Now sen I am fred fra that feir,
And vain illusioun did appeir,
Welcum my darling and my deir,
My sucker and my sweit.
159
Good sirs, quhat is their mair ado,
Ilk outh his lufe hes gotten lo,
Let us thairfoir go quickly to,
And marie with our maitts:
Let us four Lufers now rejoyse,
Ilk ane for to enjoy his choice,
Ane meiter match nor ane of those,
For tender oung estaitis.
160
Let us all four now with ane sang,
With mirth and melody amang,
Give gloir to God that in this thrang,
Hes been all our releif:
That hes fra thraldom set us fry,
And hes us placit in sik degrie,
Ilk ane as he wald wisch to be,
With glaidnes for his grief.

Ane sang of the four Lufearis.
WERE Jacobs Sons mair joyful for to se,
The waltring wawes king Pharaois Oist confound
Was Israel mair glaid in heart to be
Fred from all feir, befoir in bondage bound?
Quhen God the^ brocht from ye Egiptian ground,
Was Mordocheus merier nor we,
Quhen Artaxerxes alterit his decrie?
162
Was greiter glaidnes in the land of Greice
Quhen Jason come from Colchos hame agane
And conqueist had the famous golden Fleis,
With labor lang, with perrell and with pane?
The Father Aeon was not half sa feign,
To sie his Sone returning with sik gloir,
As we, quhais myndis ar satisfyit, and moir.
163
Gif onie joy into this Earth belaw,
Or warldlie plesour reput be perfyte,
Quhat greiter solace sall e to me shaw,
Nor till enjoy our hartis all haill delight?
To have our Lufe and lusty Lady quhyte,
In quhome e may both nicht and day rejoyse:
In quhome e may our plesures all repose.
164
Let us thairfoir sen euin as we wald wisse,
Reciprocklie with leill and mutual lufe,
As fleitand in the Fludes of joy and bliss,
With solace sing and sorrows all remufe,
Let us the fructes of present plesour prufe,
In recompense of all our former pane,
And misery, quhairin we did remane.

Philotus. 165
Bot now advert good bretherin all about,
That of my labor hes the succes seine:
e that hes hard this haill discourse throw out,
May know how far that I abusit have been,
I grant indeid their will na man me meine,
For I my self am author of my grief,
That by my calling sold be caryit cleine,
With outhlie toyis unto sa greit mischief.
166
Gif I had weyit my gravity and age,
Rememberit als my first and ancient sait,
I had not sowmit in sik vnkyndlie rage,
For to disgrace mine honor and estait,
Quhat had I bocht bot to my self debait,
Suppois the matter had cum than as I meinit:
Nay my repentance is not half sa lait,
As I had gotin the thing quhairfoir I greinit.
167
For thocht my folly did the Lord offend,
it my good God hes wrocht all for the best:
And this rebuik hes thairfoir to me send,
All sik inordinate doings to detest,
Quhilk sweit rebuik I reckin with the rest,
From fatherly affection to proceid,
That vthers with like passiouns possessed,
May leirne be my exampill to tak heid.
168
Sen age thairfoir should gouernit be with skill
Let countenance accord with our gray hairis
e ancients all, let resoun rewll our will,
Subdew our sensis till eschew their snairis,
Gif e wald not incombred be with cairis,
Be master over our awin affections haill:
For hailillie the praise is only thairs,
That may against sik passions preuaill.

The Messinger. 169
Good sirs, now have e hard and seen this serse
Unworthy of our audience I grant,
Vnformailie set out in vulgar verse,
Of waillit out words and leirnit leid bot skant
The Courteours that Princes Hallis do hant,
I wait will never for my rudenes ruse me:
it my gude-will for to supply the want,
I hope sall of our courtesies excuse me.
170
For passing weil I have imployit my panis
Swa that e can be with the same content:
For dew regaird good acceptiouns gains,
And parties pleisit dois make the time well spent
Gif God had greiter leirning to me lent,
I should have schawin the same with als good will:
Wit ignorance that I did not invent.
Ane seese that micht our fantasies fulfill.
171
Last sirs, now let us pray with ane accord,
For to preserve the persoun of our King:
Accounting ay this gift as of the Lord,
Ane prudent Prince above us for to ring.
Than gloir to God, and praysis let us sing,
The Father, Sone and halie Gaist our gyde,
Of his mercies us to conduct and bring,
To Heuin for ay, in plesoures to abide.

FINIS.
WHAT if a day or a month or a eere
Crown thy desire with a thousand wisched contentings
Can not the chance of ane nicht or ane hour,
Cross thy delights with a thousand sad tormentings?
Fortune, honor, beauty, outh are but blossoms dying
Wanton plesoures, dotting love are but shadows flying:
All our joys are but toys idle thoughts deceauing,
None hes power of an hour in their lives bereauing.
Earth's but a point of the World, and a man
Is but a point of the Earths compared centure.
Shall than the point of a point be so vain
As to delight in a silly points aventure?
All is hazard that we have, here is nothing byding:
Days of pleasures ar but stremes through fair meadows glyding
Well or woe time dois go, in time is no returning,
Secreete fates guydes our states, both in mirth and murning.
