Cayphas and asked them what was prosylyte. And they said that proselyty was
paynyms children / and so be his dyscyples / and for that they say that he is
borne in fornycacyon. Than answered these.xii. men whose names were such.
Lazarus. Astorius. Antonius. Jacob. Serius. Gamaliel. Isaak. Fyues. Azarius.
Agrippa. Amenus / and Judas. We say that we ne are proselyty / but we be Jews
children / and we say troth that we were there as Joseph wedded Mary. Than
called Pylate these.xii. men that said thus / and he coniured them by ye hight
of holy Cezar if that he were not borne i^ fornycacyon that ye bear wytnes and
surete and swear before all this people. And these.xii. men answered to Pylate
and said we have be our law that we ne ought to swear for it is syn^e / but we
will swear by holy Cezar / if it be not as we say we will be culpable of ye death.
we se well ye Jesus is not borne in fornycacyon to be byleued by their word. And
we say all said yt other that he is borne in fornycacyon / and that he is an
euyil werker. And thus he says yt he is gods sone and thereto a king / and
yet thou wylt not believe us that have the law to keep. Than commanded Pylate
that all should go out of the parlore save these xii. men that said that our
lord was not borne i^ fornycacyon / and also he commanded that our lord Jesus
should be led out unto that one side of ye parlore. Than said Pylate to the
se.xii. men. For what cause is it ye they will bring Jesus to death. And they
answered and said that the masters of ye law had him in hate because that he
heled maladyes and sykenesses upon the Sabot day. Than said Pylate. A I se
well for his good works they will slay him. Than went Pylate out of the
parlore full of heaviness and said to all ye Jews I have witness yt I can find
in this man no point of death. The Jews answered / if he had never be^ an evil
doer we ne had not delivered him to the. Than said Pylate to the Jews. what
said god that there should be no man slain but of me. Than eatred Pylate in to
the parlore again / and called our lord Jesus to him and said. Thou art king
of Jews. Our lord Jesus answered again / thou say ye of thy self or else
other have said that to ye of me. Than said Pylate unto our lord Jesus christ.
Thou w^^est well that I am no Jew but of thine own nacyon / ye bysshoppes and
princes have delivered ye to me / but I wot never what evil thou have done
them / if thou be king of Jews answer to me. Our lord answered to hy^ my
kingdom is not in this world / for if my kyngedome were in this world my
mynysters would not be against me / nor I should not have be delivered to the but
my kyngedome is not now here. Than answered Pylate / than I se well thou art a
king. Than answered our lord Jesus / thou say ye I am a king / and to that I
was borne / and for to declare to the world that who so be of troth will here
my word. Than said Pylate what is troth by thy word there is but little
troth in the world. Our lord said to Pylate / understand troth how ye it is
Iuged in earth of that yt dwell therein. And thus said Pylate to the Jews I have
witness both in heaven and in earth / son and m^ne that I can find no cause
of death in this man. Than a^swered the Jews / is not this a^grete cause that
he says of our temple / that he might dystroye it and reyse it again in three
days. Than said Pylate what temple is that the which ye speak of. And the
Jews answered that it was the temple of Salamo^ the which was in
edyfyenge.xivii. year / and this Ihesus said that he would dystroy it / and
reyse it again in three days. I am said Pylate without gylte of spyllynge of
this man's blood / and that shall ye well se what will ye do with him. The ie
was that were full of envy cried all with one voice / the shedynge of his blood
upon us and upon our children.

How Pylate took of the most ancient men of the law / as bysshoppes and
other masters to counseyle.
Cayphas. Pylate. Annas.



THan Pylate took of ye most ancient men as bysshoppes and masters of ye
law and said. Syrs do not against this simple man for I do you to wete that he
is not worthy to be deed / is not he more worthy that has heled maladyes tha^
he had broke ye sabbot day. Than said ye Jews a good Judge take heed if any
man has done a forfayte against Cezar / were he not worthy to be deed. And tha^
Pylate said unto them yes. Tha^ said ye Jews much more is he worthy yt
forfayteth against god / for he said him self that he is gods sone / for when
we coniured him that he should tell us if he were gods sone or not / he deny.
(...) it not / and yet he said yt we should se the sone of man^^^tynge upon ye
right hand of the godhede / coming out of ye skies of heaven. And when Pylate
herd thus he led our lord Jesus upon that other part of the parlore and
said to him. Man I ne wot what I may do with ye. Than said our lord Jesus to
Pylate. Moy ses and ye prophets here before preched of my passion and of my
resurteccyon. When Pylate herd this he pro nounced all the words of our lord
to ye Jews. And anon the Jews said to Pylate. What would tho^^ here more
of his false felau^der. Tha^ said Pylate take him i^ to your synagoge / and deem
there on him your law. The Jews answer / our law commands yt if any man
syn or trespass against any man he shall withdra we him.xiii. days out of the
temple. And he ye synneth or trespasseth against god by slander / our Iawe
bids that he shall be stoned to death. And for as much as Jesus says that he
shall sit in heaven upon the right side of ye deuyne mageste / and that he shall
come from heaven in to ye skies / for this sclannder we will that he be
crucyfyed. Than said Pylate ye is not good that ye cast you for to do. And than
Pylate looked about him and saw many men and women that wept sore / and held
their countenance upon him. Than under Cezare the Emperor. When ye Jews
herd this than they said to Nychodemus. ye take thou the troth of Jesus / and
ye thou may have thy dwelling place with him. Than lift up Nychodemus his
hands to heaven and said. God grant that I may have part of the troth of
Jesus / and a dwelling place might I have of him. God grant that it may be so
as ye have said

How certain Jews showed to Pylate the miracles that Christ had done.
ANd anon there starte forth a Jew before Pylate / and thus he said. My lord
Pylate I say beddred.xxxviii. year / and every day for ye most part in peril
of death / and so it befell that my lord Jesus came by me and had pity on me /
and than he had me take my bed and go home i^ to my house / and anon with his
words I was made hole. And anon after came an other Jew before Pylate and
thus he said. My lord Pylate I was poor blind / as my lord Jesus passed
before me I said to him Jesus the sone of Dauyd have mercy on me. And he had
mercy on me / and he put his hand to mine eyes and than I saw. And than
another Jew that stood before Pylate said. Sir I was a me fell and my lord Jesus
christ made me hole with his word. After that came an aged woman before Pylate
and fayd my lord Pylate I was dyseased with the reed flyx three pere and more /
and Idyd not but touch the hemme of the vesture of my lord Jesus / and anon I
was made hole of my malady / and therefore / my lord pylate have mercy on him /
and do him not to death. And when Pylate herd this he fered. And anon a great
company of Jews yt our lord Jesus had heled cried all with one voice. A great
savior of ye people is our lord Jesus. when Pylate herd this he said unto Cay
phas and Annas / and other masters of ye law. I marvel why yt your forne
faders princes and bysshoppes of ye law heled not men of their infyrmytes / as
this man does. And they answered no word thereto. And these men yt our lord
had heled cried with one voice Our blessed lord Jesus has wrought many dyuyne
miracles / as he yt raised Lazar fro death to life which had layen deed four
days in ye earth / and our lord Jesus by the virtue of his words raised him out
of his moment and brought him a live among us and his systers / and made him
to sit with him at his table. Wha^ Pylate herd this he was all abashed for
fere and cried with an high voice to the Jews and said. Men what is this that
ye wyldo. Ise that without gylte ye will shed the blood of him that has
nothing wrought amysse. Than rose Pylate up and took Nychodemus to him and
these.xii. men which that said that our lord was not borne in fornycacyon /
and thus he said to them Syrs I have great affection in you / tell me what I
shall do with him. And they said sir we can not say but we will never asseut
to the will of ye masters of the law nor to their works / and therefore let
the^se well to their souls that they may be saved at the day of Judgment. Than
turned Pylate to ye masters of the law and to the other Jews and said thus
to them Syrs ye know well that it is ye custom among us to deliver a
prysonere to the people for ye love of our sabot ye hye day of sacryfyce / and
syrs ye know well that I have i^ my pryso^ a noble pryloner a man sleer which
is worthy to be deed / whose name is Barabas / will ye that I deliver you him
or else Jesus which is with out gylte and not worthy to dye. The princes and ye
byf shoppes and ye old men they said with one voice we will that thou deliver
to us Barabas. Tha^ said Pylate what will ye than say that I do with Jesus
which is called cryft. Than said ye Jews with an hye voy ce / let him be
crucyfyed / and some said if thou let him go thus / thou ne art Cezars friend
sith that he laid this foul sclau^der that he is gods sone / and thereto a
king / for who so ever said yt he is a king / he speaks against Cezare. And
when that Pylate herd this he was wonders heavy / and thus he said to ye Jews
all days from ye beginning ye have be co^traryous to them yt have done well
to you / and to him ye have done much harm and much turmentynge. Than said
ye Jews what is he yt has done so much good to us Than said Pylate our god
which has helped you and delivered you out of ye hands of Egypt which
drowned your enemies in the depnesse of ye reed see and ^edde you thrughe the
water of the sea also dry as upon ye ground. And also in deserte he reyned
unto you ma^na and made water come out of the hard stone in desert which that
ye drank of and all your beestes. And also he gave to you the.x.
commandments of ye law. And in all these commandments that he has
charged you with ye have been contraryous to your god. As when ye made a calfe
to be your god / which would have dysheryted you and dystroyed you ne had
Moses be your master / that prayed to your god for you for ye peril yt ye
were in / and now ye say to me that I hate my king and am not his friend if I
deliver not this man Jesus that has cured much of your people of many if yrmy
ties which is your king that never did evil but ever much goodness and
profit. When the Jews herd this they were full of anger and maltalent / and
thus they cried all together and said. Our king is Cezarem perour of Rome. For
we know well yt Jesus is no king though yt kings sought him in Bedlem and said
ye they sought y king of Jews / and offered to hy^ gifts / but yet is he
thertore no king / we know well ye wha^ He rode herd say that they sought ye
king of Jews / he would have slain hy^ therefore. And so he did slay thousands
or children therefore in Bedlem and all ye country a bout / as we have said to
you here before. wha^ Pylate herd this he commanded the^ to be still / and
tha^ he said to the^. A is it not he tha^ yt Herod sought for to slay. And ye
Jews answered and said yt it was he. And anon Pylate did commanded water to
be brought to him / and before the^ all he washed his hands sayng thus. I am
not gylty of ye spylly^ge of this ryghtful man's blood and ye may you well se
/ but ye blood of hy^ be upon you and upon your children. Than commanded
Pylate ye a great company of knights should be brought before him to his
parlore. And tha^ Pysate cast ye sentence upon our lord Jesus christ and thus he
said to him.

How Pylate commanded the Jews ye no bylaynes should put Jesus christ to his
passion but knights.


Thine own people has dyspreued all that ever I have spoken for the / and
therefore I command at ye beginning ye no man lay hands on hy^ but if he be
a knight / or else of gentle blood / for it is not sitting that a king
should be slain of vylaynes / and therefore I command that at the first
beginning that he be scourged to ye pleasynge of the first princes / and than
lift him up upon the cross / and with him two thieves the which that has
beneuyll doers / that one by name ^ysmas and that other Gesmas / and let them
be slain with vyllaynes / and no gentylles to touch them. And tha^ our lord
Jesus was led out of the parlore / and the two thieves with him / and than they
lebde them in to another parlore / wherein was a pyller of white marble / and
there they dyspoyled our lord Jesus out of his clothes / and bound him naked
unto the pyller / and there they beat him and scourged him with yerds and
whyppes / so hugely that there was no skin hole upon him / and that was a
pyteful sight for to se that blessed body standing all naked before all the
people scornynge and saying thus to our lord god in his scourgyng / do gladly
our king for this is our first beginning. And than the masters of the law
said to the knights / do on our king a soft garment and let us crown him for
our king. And than ye knights did upon him a clothe of sylke which for
haboundau^ce of blood was so clonge to him / that at ye pulling of it was an
hundred fold more pain to hy^ than was his scourgynge. And when they had
pulled of this garment they did on him a reed man tell of sylke / and after
that they set a garlande of thorns upon his heed / and they pressed so sore
ye garlande of thorns upon his heed that the thorns perced down in to his
brain and so at the last they led him to the cross / and there they
crucyfyed hy^ between two thieves. Dysmas an the right side / and Gelmas on the
left side. And so they put to his mouth a sponge full of azell and gall a that
they put to his mouth for to drink of. And thus that blessed lord Jesus
suffered all that ever they would do to him. And than our lord Jesus looked up to
the fader and said thus. My fader forgive the^ this trespace / for they ne wot
what they do / and than ye knights kest lottes upon his vesture for to wete
who should have it / and than the princes of ye law with bysthoppes and many
other / they cried unto our lord Jesus and thus they said. Thou have heled
many other / and thou ne may hele thy self / if thou be gods sone come
down of the cross and we shall believe on the. And tha^ said ye knights in
scorn if you be king of Jews deliver now thy self. And than was commanded
that a knight should be brought forth whose name was Longeus / and him they
made to put a spear to Jesus side. This knight Longeus was blind / and so the
princes of the law made him for to perce our lords side and so there came out
of his side both blood and water / and so ye blood came re^nyng down by ye
spear shafte unto Longeus hand / and he by adventure wyped his eyes with his
hand / and anon he did se.

ANd than Pylate did write a bylle upon ye which was written. Jesus nazarenus
rextudeorum. That is for to say. Jesus of Nazareth king of Jesus. And this
was written in hebre we / greek / and latin. And this title they put above his
heed upon the cross. Than Gesmas the thief which henge on the left side of
our lord said thus to our lord Jesus / if thou be god deliver both the and
us. Than Dysmas that henge on the tyghte side of our lord Jesus blamed him for
his words and thus he said to him. It seems by thy words that you dredest not
god nor byleuest not in him / and therefore thou art endlesly dampened / for well
thou wotest that we have deserved that we suffer death / but he has right
naught forfayted nor mysdone / and without deler uynge he is brought here to.
And when Dysmas had said these words he looked upon Jesus christ and thus he said
to him. Lord Jesus have mercy upon me wha^ thou come in to thy kingdom. And
than answered Jesus unto him and said. This day shalt thou be with me in
Paradyce / and that time was about myddaye / and fro this time unto none of ye
day the son was hid and lost his bryghtnes / and the veil of ye temple
was smyten down to the ground in two parties and some men say that an
angel did it with a trace of fire. And this au^gel said many one heryng I am
witness of ye passion of Jesus Christ. After that our lord Jesus christ cried
with an high voice and said. Fader in to thy hands I be take my spyryte /
and than he yielded up his soul unto his fader. And when Centurio that was
prince over the Jews / and Constable in like wise saw these tokens that were
be fall he gloryfyed god and said / forsooth this man was right full / and that
is well seen by ye tokens that are be fallen And so all the people that were
there as good folks when the saw these works of ye virtue of our lozde they
smote the yrbrestes with their hands.

How Centurio told Pylate of the wonders that was at Christ's passion / and
the same Pylate told the Jews thereof / and of the precious cloth that our
lord was buried in.
Cayphas. Pylate. Centurio.



ANd Centurio told to Pylate all that was be fall. And wha^ Pylate herd this
he was wonders heavy and lory / and so for forynesse and heaviness he ne ete nor
dra^ke that day Than called Pylate the Jews / and thus he said to them.
Marvel ye not of ye tokens that here be fallen at the passion of Jesus / and
that the son lost his light and also the day. And the Jews said to Pylate.
Syrit was the clypse of the son as we have understood of wise men before us.
Tha^ said Pylate how may it be that ye veil of the temple is smyten a sonder
and many graves undone / and deed men rise up from death to life / has ye
clypse of the sone done all this. All these tokens men tell me are befalle^ in
the cite of Jerusalem / and if ye believe not me ask Centurio / and they that
were with him which kept Jesus. Than were these men brought forth before ye
Jews which that bare witness / and thus they said. Forsothe we say ye in
the dyenge of Jesus the earth groned and shoke as a water does when it is meued /
and we same that many bodies arose frodeth to life / and by these tokens we
believe that this Jesus is gods sone. Than ye apostles and holy women that had
followed our forde Jesus fro Galylee / saw that was befallen and that men had
done to him dre we them by them self. Than Joseph of Barmathy kest hy^ for to
by a precious clothe for to wind our lord Jesus in when he might get grant
of Pylate for to have ye body. And on these wise came Joseph by this precious
cloth as ye shall here. There was a knyt of Capharnane whose name was Leuy /
this knight wedded a young lady / and by process of time they had together a
daughter / whom they called Syn donia and her they put to learning / and so by
process of time she wexed a curyous werker / as of clothes of gold and
clothes of sylke / and of all other women's works. And so at the last wha^ god
would this Leuy dyed and than his wife for ye great love that she loved him she
fell in to a great malady as in a palsy / so ferforth that she might neither
stere hand nor foot / and so for this great sekenes she fell ia great pouerte
so ferforth that she ne had to live upon / but vy the work of her daughters
hands. And so it befell that upon the same day that our lord Jesus was deed
this lady said to her daughter. My dou ghter Syndonia thou know well that
our great sabbot day is nere / than must we ete our paske lamb / and on this
day is ye great market at Barmathye / therefore good daughter go and array the
/ and take some of thy work that thou have wrought and bye us there such
things as is nedeful to the and me at this holy time. Her daughter Sindonia
answered to her mother and said / mother your will shall be do ne / and mother I
do you to understand that I have wrought the curyousest cloth that ever was
made / for it fell so grac yously to work that it is more curyous than I can
skyl of / and than ye lady said to her daughter let me se that clothe / and
Syndonia she wed this cloth to her mother. And wha^ this lady saw this cloth she
said thus. Blessed be that lord that has made ye to work such a cloth / and
daughter upon my blessing sell it to no man but if he tell the what he shall
do withal. And than this maid Syndonia washed and bawmed her / and arrayed
her to the market / and in ye market stood Joseph of Barmathye with much
people speaking of our lords death / and by adventure this maid Syndonia came
before him / and Joseph of Bar mathye espied ye clothe that hanged on her arm
/ and asked her if she would sell that cloth. And she answered and said ye sir.
And than Joseph asked her ye price and she said.xxx. besauntes. And anon
Joseph paid to her.xxx. besauntes. And Syndonia fell down to his fete prayeng
him yt he would tell her what he should do withal. And than he answered her
and said. Daughter this day is deed an holy prophet that men called Jesus of
Nazareth / and that holy prophet Ipurpose for to bury and wind in this cloth
/ daughter now have I told ye what Iwyll do withal / and therefore tell me who
made this cloth that I have bought of the. And this maid said that her self
made it. And Joseph asked her what was her name / and she said Syndonia Than
said Joseph now after you I shall name this cloth for this cloth shall be named
Syndonia / and than this maid went home to her mother and told her how she
had spedde / and her mother asked her what should be done with the cloth. And
Syndonia told her that the holy prophet that was yt time deed should be
buried therein. And who shall bury him therein said this lady And Syndonia said
yt Joseph of Barmathye should burye him therein. And wha^ this lady herd this
she said thus. Would my lord god and that prophet that I had given that cloth
to his buryeng. And anon with that word she was more holer tha^ ever she was
before And anon ye lady and her daughter fell down to the ground upon their
knees thank ynge our lord god of this glorious miracle. And so afterward our
lord gave them such grace that the mother was wedded to a worthy duke / and her
daughter was Empress of Rome And so they lived ever after in our lords
service / and wha^ Joseph of barmathye had bought / this precious cloth which
was lord and Constable over all Pylates me / he was a full good man and a
ryghtful / he was not assented to the accusacyo^s and words of the Jews he
abode ye kingdom of god / and so he came to Pylate and asked him the body of
Jesus. And Pylate granted hy^ it. Than this Joseph and Nychodemus took down
the body of Jesus of the cross / and him he wound in this Sindonia that he had
bought / and he buried him in his monument / where as never man was buried in
and so ye Jews would have slain Joseph and the.xii. men ye had spoken for our
lord Jesus before Pylate. And also they would have slain Nychodemus / and also
those yt our lord had made hole of many great infyrmytes and alson they had
dyscouered before Pylate all his good works that he had done in every place.

How the Jews co^spyred evil against Nychode mus and Joseph / and of many
other meruayles.


THAN Nicho demus. we wed hi self to ye Jews / hicause ye he was their prince
and their guide / and sone after there gadered a great multitude of Jews in
toye temple before Ny chodemus / and thus he said to the^. How may this be that
ye are entered i^ to this holy temple which have your hanoes blody of the death
of Jesus that ryghtfull man whom ye have untruly crucyfyed. Than answe red to
Nychodemus / Annas and Cayphas / Symeon and Datan / Gamaliei / Judas / Leuy /
Neptalim / and all the other Jews / how art thou so hardy to come among us
that art consenting to Jesus / and therefore such part as he has must thou
have with ye in this world. Than answered Nychodemus and said. A men ye peace
of Jesus be with me in this world / and in that other endlesly. And ye Jews
answered and said. A men And as Nichodemus had a^swered thus / came Joseph of
Barmathye among them and said thus to ye Jews why be ye beuy to me with
maletale^te for Iasked ye body of Jesus of Pylate / and Ido you to were yt I
have buried hy^ in my new monument / and wound him in a precious clothe ye is
called Syndonia. And I say to you that ye have wrought evil and synfully ye ye
have untruly crucyfyed Jesus without deseruynge / and also malycyously ye persed
his side with a spear / and wha^ ye Jews herd this they took Joseph and
commanded hy^ to be kept well and thus they said to Joseph. we know well ye
you art not worthy to have a buryenge place among us for we shall give thy
flesh and careyne to wild bestes and wild fowls / and to be devoured with
hounds. Than Joseph said to the^ these words / ye be like to proud Golyas as
ye prophet says / to me lo^geth vengeance and I shall yield it says god. And
yet wha^ yt Pylate washed his hands and said I am unguilty of this man's
blood shedyng / he answered and said / ye blood of him be on us and on our
children / wete it well that fro ye time forward shall ye wrath of god come
upon you and upon your children as your self said / and wha^ ye Jews her de
this they were right angry / and put Joseph in a derke prison and shyt the door
strongly and put thereto kepers. Than Annas and Cayphas and other bysshoppes of
the law / kest for to assemble them after ye sabbot day for to slay Joseph /
and when they were assembled they sent to the prison and vndyde the door / but
they found not Joseph therein / wherefore they were fore abashed.

How one of ye knights that kept the sepulcre of our lord came and told the
masters of the law how our lord was gone in to Galisee.

ANd as they were i^ this are ruaylyng they and ne entered in to their synagoge
/ and among the^ there came one of the knyghres yt kept the sepulcre and to
them he told right sykerly yt our lord Jesus was not in ye monument. And anon
the masters of ye law asked him where ye they had done him. And ye knight thus
answered them and said. As we kept ye grave the earth shoke / and than we saw
verily that an aun gell descended down from heaven and lyfted up the stone
from the monumente / and set him there upon / and his face was very bryghte /
and his vesture was white as snow / and for the great dread that we had we
lay as we were deed. Than we herd the au^gelt say unto the women that were
comen to the sepulcre dysmaye you not nor dread you not / for I know well that
ye seek Jesus that was crucyfyed / but Ido you to were that he is risen and is
not here / for ye shall se him in Galylee / as he said to you before. And when
the princes of the law herd this they said to ye knight. Is Jesus than on
live / we may not vyleue this that ye say. Than the knight answered them. Jesus
has done many myracies that ye have well herd / and seen and ye believe it not
how should ye than believe us but your own demand is good / when ye ask if
Jesus be on live / whom than said ye Ie was to ye knight we shall yield to
(...) Joseph if ye will yield to us Jesus for we do you to were that Joseph is
i^ Barmathy Than said ye knight / and we do you to were that Jesus is in Galilee
risen from death to life / and there they should se him. And when ye Jews herd
this they had great dread / and thus they said among themself / if men here
these words of these knights they shall all believe in Jesus. Than they
assembled them together and gave to the knights treasure / and thus they said
to the^. Goye and say to ye people as ye lay and slepte his dyscyples came
pryuely by night and stole ye body of Jesus / and if Py late know here of we
shall excuse you. Thus ye knights took this treasure and proclaimed as they
commanded them / and so their words were soon spread all about.

THan came there three men which yt hight Fie nees / Abbas / and Leuy / these
three men came fro Galilee in to Jerusalem and thus they said to ye princes and
to all them yt were in the synagoge. Syrs we have herd and seen Jesus which
that ye crucified and fyt and speak to his dyscyples upon ye mount of olyuete
and there he preched to them and said. Go and preche my name and my gospel
through out ye world / baptysynge in the name of the fader / and ye sone / and
ye holy ghost And what so ever he be that will be baptized and believe in me he
shall be saved / and he that byleueth not shall be dampened. And when ye princes
herd this they said to these three men. Men give praysynge and worship to our
lord Jesus and be a know if this be true that ye have hard and lene / and
these men said all together with one voice / by that lord that is god of Abraham
/ of ysa ac / and Jacob / we saw Iesusy ttynge and prechyng to his dyscyples /
and if we cover this that we have herd and seen we should do great syn^e. And
anon ye pry^ces rose up and held ye law in their hands / and thus they said
to them. we conture you by the laws of our lord that ye keep this counseyle
ye ye have said to us of Jesus / and so they gave to these three men great
treasure / and so they sent three knights with them for to bring them in to
their own country / and that they should nolenger abide in Jerusalem.

SO came there agrete assemble of comyns to ye princes / and thus they said
with a great co^playnt / what tokens are these that are befalle^ in Israhell.
Than Annas and Cayphas conforted the^ and said we ought not for to believe ye
knights that kept the sepulcre wherein that Jesus was put / they said to us
that they had seen an angel lift up ye stone from the monument / and
peradventure his dyseyples said to ye knights / and we wot well ye they gave
to ye knights great treasure for to say thus / and so stale away his body /
thus men ought to byleuevs rather than the dyscyples that gave the knights
great treasure for to bear false witness. Than arose Nychodemus up and thus he
said to them / ye have herd what these three men have said and sworn upon the
law that they saw Jesus sytte and speak to his dyscyples upon the mount of
olyuete / and there he styed up to heaven. And ye wot well that ye scripture
tells us that Elye ye holy prophet was rauysshed in to paradyce / and wha^
me^ asked his dyscyple Elyze we where that his fader Elye was / he answered
rauysshed in to heaven. and than they supposed well ye he was rauysshed by ye
holy ghost and left him somwhere on ye mou^tes of Israel / and therefore they
said let us seek some men that may go and seek him. So they went and sought
three days and three nyghtes / but they could not find Elye / and therefore I
counfeyle you for to send some for to seek ye mou^tes of Is^ahell / for
parauenture ye holy ghost had rauysshed Jesus / and parauenture he may be found
/ let us than do penance for the trespass ye we have done. This counsel of
Nychodemus was plesynge to all ye Jews and so they sent men for to seek our
lord Jesus / but they might not find him in no place. And wan these men were
repaired again they said to ye te was / we have lought Jesus on every hill of
Israel / and in every dale and i^ every place / but we can find hy^ no where
but we have found Joseph in ye cite of Barmathy / and wha^ ye princes herd
this they were wonders joyful and merry / and they gloryfyed god ye Joseph was
found / and so ye fewes and may sters of ye law assembled the^ together / and
kest among the^ how they might speak to Joseph / and so they made letters
which said thus. Peace be we the and also we them ye be we the / we know well
ye we have spn^ed in god and in the / and therefore fader Joseph come to us sith
ye we have knowing ye we have grievously syn^ed and trespast flyenst ye and
hugely we marvel of thy delyuerau^ce and taking away fro us. we know well
ye we co^spyred evil counsel against ye but goddelyuered ye fro us / but peace
be we the fader Joseph worshyppes of all people.

How ye Jews chose.viii men that were Iosephes trendes to desire him to come
to them.
THan they chose. viii. men which that were fre^des to Joseph and said when ye
come to Joseph salve him in peace / and do to hy^ gretynges in our behalf and
deliver to him these letters. So these men went forth to ye cite of Barmathye /
and wha^ they came before Joseph they salued him and great him and delivered to
him ye letters And wha^ Ieteph had reed these letters he said thus, Blessed be
my lord god that has covered me with his wings / and also blessed might he
he that has saved me from all myscheue. Tha^ Joseph ladde all these men in to
his place / and ye next day aftes he took his horse and rode with them in to
Jerusalem. And when ye Jews with the masters of the law herd tell of his
coming they went worshypfully against him / and wha^ they met with him they
said thus to him. Peace be at thy coming fader Joseph / and Joseph answered.
The peace of our lord be to all his true people. And than ye masters of the
law with all the people they kysted Joseph. And Nychodemus led Joseph in to
his house. Than the next day after Annas and Cayphas and Nychodemus ladde
Joseph in to the temple / and thus they said to him. Fader Joseph give us
knowledge and to god this temple of that we shall are of you / fader Joseph ye
know well yt ye berryed the body of Jesus / and fader ye know well yt we
shette you inpryson and we could not find you therein and therefore tell us what
befell there Thau Joseph answered and said what ye did she its me in ye eldse
prison upon ye sabbot day as I was in my^^ or y^^^^ and prayers ye place was
spredde above me with huge light as me thought feont the foute parties of ye air
/ and so Ilyfte up my heed and saw mylorde Iesustande fast by me shynyng with
great clerenesse / and so for dread that I had Ife^dovone flat to the
goou^de. Than my blessed lord Issaher^^ me by the h^^^ de and ly^^ me up from
the groside and washed my fate kyssyn^^ me and thus he said to me. Brother
Joseph ye are elens by ye water of thy faith / for thy sins ben rel eased and
forgyuen / and there is my frenbe have ^od^e^e (...) set hold me and know what
I am and so Ioyde behold ^ him and said any may ster Elye and he answated
again and laid. I am not Elyt but I am Iosucryst ye wh^ the thou buried
worshypfully / and than fayd I to him Lord show me thy monument where Ibaryed
the And than my forde Jesus hente me by the hand and ladde me to the monumente
/ and there he showed me the precious Syndonia that I wound him in. And than I
knew verrly that he was my lord Jesus / and so I fell down and worshypped him
/ and said my lord Jesus blessed might thou be that art come hyder for to
vysyte me / and thrughe thy grace have delivered me and so he held me by the
hand and ladde me to ye cite of Barmath ye. And than he ladde me in to my
place and said to me. Joseph brother peace be with the / and look ye thou go not
out of thy place these.xi. days / for ye Jews shall do many great dystresses
to many of my fre^des / and now shall I go to my dyscyples and speak to them of
ye saluac yo^ of the world. And when he had said yt word he vanysshed away
from me / and wha^ ye princes of the law and other Jews herd this that
Joseph laid / they were hugely abashed / and for ye great dread yt they had
they fell down to ye earth / and so they cried and said. what tokens are these
yt are befallen in Isra hell the knights that kept ye sepulcre bear witness
yt they law an angel dyscende down from heaven / and that Jesus was risen
frodeth to life / and that he shall he seen in Galelee. And we know welthat
Jesus was a man / and his fader and mother we know well / both Joseph and Marye.
What may we say here against. Than said a Jew whose name was Leuius. I know
well the begyunynge of Jesus / for I have been mothe with them / for upon a time
as I was in ye temple in mine offrynges and orylons / that same time saint
Symeon took him in his arms / and thus he said to him. My lord godlette now
thy servant come to the in peace / for mine eyes have seen thy health that thou
ordained or any people was. Than said ye Jews. Let us send for these three men
that said that they saw Jesus speaking to his dyscyples upon the mount of of
yuete. And so they sent for these three men / and wha^ they were come^ for them
they said truly that god of heaven was on live / and that we saw berely how
that Iesustped in to henen before all his dyseyples.

THa^ a^swered Annas and cayphas / out law says that by ye words of two or
three is suffycyent witness / what may we sayhereto / we know well ye Enocke
pleased god / and was rauy flhed in to heaven and ye fepulchre of Moses might
never be fou^de^. Pylate delivered to us this Jesus which we bear with frourges
and crowned him with thorns / and after ward was crut yfyed / and smote him in
ye side with a spear and Joseph buried his body in ye sepulcre / which ye now
bears wytnes yt he is on live. And these men say yt they saw hy^ stye up in
to heaven / and tha^ Joseph told another great meruay le yt there rose up many
deed bodies out of the yr graves I wot well yt some me^ of the^ have been in
Ierufale^ / which yt mysbyleuers have not seen / and we know well yt saint
Simeon received Iesuin his atmes in ye temple which was a full holy man / this
Simeon had two sons whose names were Garius and Leuicius and we were at
theyrdeth and at their but yenge. Go now and search the yr graves / but I wot
well they be not there / but they be in yt cite of Barmathye in orylons and
speak to noma^ / but keep the^ still as though they were deed / and therefore
let us go to the^ with worship / and bring them to ye temple / and wha^ we have
co^iured them pars uenture they will tell us somewhat of ye resurtete you of
Jesus / and how that he rose from death to life.

How the Jews went to seek two deed men that were risen from death to life in
Barmathye.
Cayphas. Annas. Earius.



ANd so al ye jews and masters of ye law went to ye graves of these two
bredren / and so they found the^ not there. And anon they went to ye cite of
Barmathy which was.xl. mile fro Jerusalem / and so they found the^lyuynge.
Than they kyssed the^ and led them with them to Jerusalem with great worship /
and tha^ they lad the^ i^ to their synagoge / and wha^ they had shet ye doors
surely they took their laws / and co^fured the^ by ye law of Israel / and by
god adonay if yt theylyued / and if yt Jesus was god of Israel yt raised the^
wha^ Garius and Leuicius herd this co^iuracyo^ / they looked up together in to
heaven. And tha^ they made signs of ye holy cross on the^ / and than they said
and spoke / give us per thement and ynke / yt we may write things yt we have
herd and seen / and so they gave to them both ynke and perchement / and when
they were set they wrote both together and said thus.

Our lord Ielucryst is resurreccyo^ of ye death and life yt believe upon hy^ /
suffer us to say ye secrets of thy dyuyne mageste that you dydest in hell by ye
death of thy holy cross / for we be co^iured by ye for to speak of ye / you have
commanded to thy servant by Myghell thyn archau^gel yt we should tell ye
secrets of thy dyuyne mageste what you dydest in hell after thy holy
resurreccyo^ as we were with our forne faders in ye great preuy depnes of derknes
there came a great bryghtnesse as it had been a beme of light fro ye son / and
yt kest alyght royal upon us / and anon Adam ye was our forne fader / and
patryarkes and prophets rose up lightly and said. This is ye light of him yt
behyght us for to send to us endeles light and anon ysaac with an high voice
began for to say.

This is ye light of our fader sone of god as I said here before when I was on
live in the land of zabulo^ and neptalem over ye flomiordan. The people that
sat iderkenes saw great bryghtnes of light and ye light was sent to them
that sat in ye shadow of death that was there as it had been a sterre shynynge
above upon us. And as we were in this Joy and gladness of this light that
shone upon us there came to us our fader Symeon and thus he said to us with
great Joy.

Gloryfye our lord god Jesus christ our savior which I received a child in ye
temple / and took him in mine arms saying thus / let now thy servant pass
for mine eyes have seen thy health / when all ye great company of layntes that
were i^ hell herd this they were wonders Joyful and merry. And after came
another ma^to us as it had be^ an heremyte / and our forne fader asked him what
he was / and he answered again and said I am a voice of a prophet of an hye
company for I have gone before ye face of his coming / and also to make ready ye
way of his coming / and to give health and co^nynge to his people in the
remystyon of their sins / and wha^ Isawe him come tome I was fulfilled with
ye holy ghost / and thus I said / se the lawbe of god and be hold him that
does away sin of the world / and him I have baptized in the Flomiordan and
upon him I saw ye holy ghost delcende in lykenes of a dove. And than I herd a
voice yt came fro heaven saying thus / this is my sone in whom great plesynge
is unto me. And now I am come before him to you to she we to you the sone of
god is come fro he yght for to deliver us yt sit in derkenesse / and in ye
shado we of dethabydyng his mercy. When yt Adam our forne fader was baptized
anon he said to Seth his sone. Tell to thy thyldren and to patryatkes and
prophets yt the angel laid to the when I sent the to ye gates of paradyce
that you sholdest pray our lord god yt he would send to me by his au^geil of
ye fruit of lyte / and also of the oil mercy for to anoynte withal my membrs
such time yt I was fulfilled full of malady and sickness. Than Seth starte up
and said with an high voice. As I was at ye gates of paradyce prayenge our
lord god of ye oil of mercy our lord sent Myghell his archau^gell sayage
thus unto me our lord god has sent me to ye / travail not for to have ye
oil of mercy to anoynte with Adam thy fader / Ido do the to were thou may not
have it unto the last day be complete of.v. M. and.v. C. year. And than shall
the sone of god Jesus christ come in to ye world for to reyfe the body of Adam
thy fader / and ye bodies of the holy saints patriarchs and prophets / and
than shall he be baptized in flomiordan / and wha^ he comes out of the water
than shall he anoint with the oil of mercy all those yt shall believe in him /
and than shall the sone of god go down to hell and led Adam thy fader in to
paradyce to the tree of life and mercy. when the patryarkes and prophets herd
this ye which Seth had said / they made than great Joy and gladness / and
as they made this great Joy Satan the prince of hell and master of death said
to ye masters of turmentry Make the ready for to receive Jesus Christ the which
that gloryfyeth him self to be ye sone of almighty god and yet he is man that
dredeth death / for he did say my soul is heavy against death. And this Jesus has
wrought many heuynesses and euylles against me for them that I made blind
crooked and lame and mezel he has made hole by his word. And also ye deed that
I have brought to the he has raised to life. Than the prince of turmentry
answered to Satan what is he yt is somyghty by his word / and thou say
that he is man that dredeth death / all that ever were mighty in earth thou have
brought the^ to my bo^des / and if he be so mighty in man hode as thou say.
I say to ye he is so mighty in dyuynyte yt we may never resyst against him /
and if ye he said that he dradde death I say to ye that he will dysceyue the
and overcome ye at all times / and than answered Satan to the masters of ye
tourme^try and said Why dredest thou for to receive mine adversary and thine I
have made the Jews for to be against him / and I have made ready the rod that
he shall be smyte^ with / and I have made ready ye tree that he shall be crucyfyed
on / and three nails for to faste^ him thereto / and I have made a drink with
azel and gall that he shall drink / and I tell the that he shall be deed anon
/ and I shall bring him redely to the. Than answered the prince of the
tourmentrye / this that thou say yt he by his might has taken fro me them
that were deed / what hopest thou he may be yt does such maystryes by his
word. I dred me perauenture that this was he that took away Lazer from me and
raised him that was three days deed / whom that I held boside in my prison /
and him he yielded to life by his word. Than an swered Satan and said. I do
the to were that he is the same Jesus. And when ye prince of turmentry herd
this he said to Satan I co^ture the by thy virtue and mine that thou bring
him nothere to me / for wha^ I herd the commandment of his word I trembled
and shoke for dred and all my fell sergeau^tes with me so that we ne might keep
Lazer / but he fle we fro us so swyfte as it had been an Egle out of the bonds
that we had him in / and ye earth that he lay in deed vndyd and yielded him
quycke fro him / wenest thou Satan for to hold such a lord that took his
servant fro us maugre us all by the virtue of his word / were you well this
without doubt if thou bring him hyder that is so mighty to save all mankind /
he will put us hens I say Satan and all tho that be shytte in our prison and
strayned by their sin in our bo^des by him they shall be delivered and brought
unto everlasting life And as they spoke thus together there came a voice as it
had be^ thonder of ye holy ghost / and thus he said. (At tollite portas
pricipes vr^as) ye pry^ces of death unclose your gates / for ye pry^ce of glory
shall enter therein And when the prince of hell herd this voice he said to
satan / go hens fro us and thou be might yo fight / go fight with him that is
king of glory. And so helkest satan fro hy^ / and tha^ he said to his fell
sergeau^tes shyt myghtely your gates with yren bars and fight myghtyly / and
withstand him myghtly that the king of bliss come not herein / yt our
strength be not taken from us / and we be put unto endelesse soro we. And wha^
the saints herd this they said with an high voice to ye deuylles and to ye
princes of turmentynge wretches undo your gates and let the king of glory come
in. Than said Dauyd ye prophet / prophesied I not when I was living in earth
and said thus (Quia hec est dies qua^ fecit dn^s exultemus et letemur in ea
That is to say / this is the day yt god made / therein we may be blythe and
glad. And after him said ysaye to all ye saints. Said I not when I was living
that ye deed should be lift up and the bodies that lie in graves should be
raised up frode the to life / and that they ye be in earth should be full of Joy
/ and yet I say now more ye cayt yues of death and hell where is now your pride
where is now your vyctorye. when ye saints herd ysaye say these words /
they said all at ones to ye pry^ce of hell. Undo your gates wretches for ye be
but taken and bound and may not help your self. Tha^ came ye voice ye
second time saying thus (Attollite portas vr^as) And when that hell herd this
voice come two times he answered vnauysedly thus (Quis e^iste rex glory that
is to say / what is ye king of bliss. And than answered David saying thus. I
know well yt voice by his words of ye holy ghost. For I prophesied it before,
and now I say to the hell (Du^s deus fortis etpotens dn^s pote^s i^ prelio /
ipse est rex glory) this is for to say. Our lord god strong and mighty / and
mighty in battle / he is king of glory (Et ipse de celo i^ terram aspexit vt
audiret gemetus co^peditoru^ vt solueret filios intere^ptoru^) That is to say
/ that blessed lord beheld fro heaven to earth to here ye waymentynge of them
that are in bonds / and that he should unbind ye chyl dren that were brought
to ye death to be slain / and therefore thou vylsayne stynkynge hole undo thy
gates ye the king of bliss may come in.

ANd as Dauyd had said this to hell / came upon them the glorious desired king
of glory in form of man / and enlumyned all the derkenesse of hell with the
glorious bryghtnesse of his glorious face / and all ye gates and shyttynges
with yren bars and boltes all to braste in his holy coming / and all ye tell
fendes made him space and way. And wha^ ye saints saw Jesus our savior come
with au^gelles / they were abashed of ye great Joy so yt theyne durst speak
/ but wc great and soft heart they said thus. Our lord god and our savior you
art come to us king of glory to deliver us out of the bonds fro these false
felons / and blessed be thy name / for now shall we be made hole. Than came our
lord Jesus and brast all ye bonds that we were bound with / and commanded
that we should be delivered of all anguysshes from that time forward. And when
the prince of hell with all his fell sergeau^tes saw ye great bryghtnesse /
they had than huge sorrow and dread. Than.x. princes of hell rose up of their
setes with huge full roryng and cryenge / and said thus with great way mentyng. O
Jesus how we be overcome by the / what man art thou that reysest thy request
against god un knowing us what art you that brekest all our power what art thou
that art so great and appeared solytel in earth. what art thou that was so meke
and lowly i^ earth and now thou art a pryncely fyghter in form of man and now
king of glory ye was deed and now thou lyuest and now al creatures tremble
and quake by the cross and by the death / and were buried in a sepulcre and art
dyscended down to us / all quyck creatures tremble and quake be thy death / and
all the four elements showed their tokens / and now have thou delivered al
them that were deed and dystroubled / and put to myschefe al our full fell my
hysters. what art you that have delivered the^ that were dystreyned here among
us for their sin / and haste called them again to their first fraunchyse.
what art thou that gyuest light to them that are blind by ye bryghtnesse of
thy godhede. And tha^ all yt were in hell cried with one voice and said. A what
art thou ye art so mighty a man and so clear in mageste shynynge with out blame
and clean of erthly sin / what art thou that entrest in to our regyon and
country without dread / and doubtest no point of turmentynge but have fro us
all tho that were streyned in our bonds / parauenture you art that Jesus yt our
nrynce Satan said to our princes that thou sholdest take to ye all the power of
ye world by thy death of ye croste. Than our lord Jesus Christ took Satan and
bound him and del yuered him in to hell to the prince of turmentry. Than be
held Satan saying thus to him. A ^chucnk^prynce of perdycyon Belsabub with
thy three hedes / liar upon ye au^gelles of god why have thou do this false
deed. A what a dyffpoylynge thou behyghtest us when you let him fall to such a
deed / what harm thou did to us wha^ thou let the king of glory be
crucyfyed. A thou falls Satan thoune wotest what thou have done / for this Jesus
has enlumyned all the derkenesse of death with the clerenesse of his dyuynyte /
and has now broken all the gates of our deep pryfons / and unbound all that
were therein / and they that were i^ our turmentryes they scorn us and by their
prayers we shall ever after be over come yt never before durst say one word
against us / and now shall never none of mankind come among us but ever shall
led us where they will / ye never before durst do against us / and now are they
fulfilled full of merualous Joy by ye praysynge of their lord god. A thou
prince of all shrewdnes / and fader of all telonyes why have thou done thus /
how durst you do such a lord be crucyfyed / for now be all tho that were in
dyspayre fro ye be gynnyng unto this time now in health and in endless ly te.
And we shall never here their grudgy^ge gronyng nor weeping. A thou fell Satan
all ye riches yt thou had conquered by thyn apple i^ paradise / you have now
lost by ye tree of ye cross / and all thy Joy is perysshed while that you have
crucyfyed him ye was against the / and wete thou well that thou shalt suffer
tormentry end lesly in mine horrible prison. A thou falls cursed Satan auctor
of death and fader of pride thou sholdest first have inquired his cause: and if
he had be worthy death and if thou had found no cause of death in him
thou sholdest have left him on live / but thou found no fault nor cause to
crucyfye him / and because thou were so hardy to crucyfye him / thou art ye
cause that he is entered in to our regyon / and wotest thou what you have done. I
say to ye thou have all forlorn and we wretches shall dwell in turmentrye yt
ever shall last as hell And as Satan spoke thus came the king of bliss and
thus he said to hell. Thou prince of hell Satan thy power shall be endlesly too
dwell here instead of Adam and his children and all my ryghtfull people. and
than our blessed lord spredde forth his right hand and said come to me my
holy and all that have mine image and my likeness which were dampened to ye death
by the fruit of the apple and by ye devil / and now may ye well se yt the
devil is dampened by the tree and by the cross / and anon all ye saints
assembled the^ together under our lords hand. Than our lord took Ada^ by the
right hand and said thus to him. My peace be with ye and all my ryghtfull
children / and all my holy saints / and tha^ our fornfad fell down on his
knees before our blessed lord wepy^ge for Joy / and thus he said (Exaltabote
dn^e qm^ suscepisti me no^ delectasti i^ imicos meos super me. Dn^e deus meus
clamaut ad te et sanasti me deduristi ab iteris aiam mea^ sanasti me a
desce^de^tibus in lacu^) This is to say. My lord I shall enhaunce ye for that
thou have taken me / for you ne have suffered mine enymyes to be above me. My
lord god I have crted to the and thou have made me hole / you have brought my
soul out of hell and have saved me from them ye are fallen in the depnesse of
ye lake. And than all the saints fell down to our lords fete saying all with
one voice to our lord god / you art come to us byer of ye world / blessed be
thy name as thou she west to us by the holy laws and by the holy prophets /
thou bought us again by thy holy cross and you art come down to us by thy
holy virtue for to draw us fro death / and fro ye horrible pains of hell / and
tha^ our blessed lord lift up his hand and made ye sign of ye holy cross
on Adam and on his holy saints. And so he took Adam by ye right hand and
styed out of hell up in to the air and all ye saints followed him. Than king
Dauyd said with an high voice (Cantate dn^oca^ticu^ nou^ quia mirabilia fecet)
That is to say. Sing to our lord god a new song / for he has wrought
meruayles (Ethec est gloria oibus sa^ctis eius) this is to say / blessed be god
for thy great Joy to all his saints Than after Dauyd said Micheas (Quis deus
sicut tu domine auferens iniquitatem and tra^sgredie^s peccataet nunc continens
in testimonio tram tua^. etc) That is for to say. Whois such a lord as our
lord Jesus christ is putting away al euylles of sin / and after him said
Abacuk the prophet. Thou come out with health unto thyn humble people for to
deliver all thy friends from all sorrows dyseases and trybulacyons. And tha^
after him said all ye holy saints with one voice. Blessed might thou be that
comes i^ the name of our lord Jesus christ / for thou art Joy and also bliss
unto all thy true people (Alleluya) And than all ye prophets pronounced all
their prophecyes that they had showed in earth with great pleasynge to our lord
god. And than all the saints said / this is our lord god that shall govern
us without end. Alleluya.

How our lord led all his holy saints in to the Joys of paradyse / and of
the three men yt they met.
ANd than our lord took Adam our forne fader by the hand and led him in to
paradyse and al his holy saints with him / and them he delivered to Myghell
his archau^ gell / and he led them in to paradyse where as is end less Joy.
And wha^ they were entered in to paradyle there came against them two men of
great age and the saints asked them what they were / and how it might be that
they were there so bodyly and had not ben with them in hell. Than one of them
answered and said I am Enocke that by ye word of god am translated hyder / and
he that is with me here is Elias tesbytes which was brought hyder in a
brennynge chair / and yet suffered we no death / but we are kept to ye coming
of Antecryst to fight with him with words and tokens of our lord god / and of
him we shall be slain in ye cite of Jerusalem / and three days and a half
after we shall rise fro death to life / and be taken up in ye skies. And as
Enocke told this to ye saints / there came to them a man berynge upon him ye
sign of ye holy cross. And when all ye saints saw him they said to him what
man may thou be that have here ye lykenes of a thief / and why berest thou the
sign of the holy cross. And than this man answered unto them and said /
forsooth ye say truly that I was a thief / and many cursed de des did I in earth.
And therefore the Jews crucyfyed me with our lord Jesus / and when I saw ye
sterynges of ye elements in his passion I byleued that he was savior of the
world / and maker of all creatures / and king almighty / tha^ said I to him /
lord have mercy on me / and have me in mind wha^ thou come in to thy
kingdom. And anon that blessed lord took my prayer / and said to me. This
day shalt thou be with me in paradyce. And than he took me the sign of the
holy cross / and said to me / bear this sign with the and go to paradyce. And
if the angel that is keeper of paradyce will not suffer ye toentre in / she we
him the sign of the cross / and say to him ye Iesucryst which that was now
crucyfyed sent me to the / and when I had said this to the angel / anon he
vndyde ye gates and led me i^ to paradyse / and set me on ye right side
saying thus to me / suffer and hold ye here a little while / for Adam which
is fader of all mankind with all this children and all the fre^des of god shall
come hyder by the virtue of crystes passion. And when the holy saints as
patryarkes and prophets had herd these words of this thief than they said al
with one voice. Blessed be our lord god almighty endless fader of mercy that
such grace has given to sinners and brought us to ye Joy of paradyse and in
to the pasture of delyght and to endless Joy. Amen.

THese are the holy secrets of the dsuynyte that we have seen I Garius and my
brother Leuicius but our lord god will suffer us no longer to tell and she we
unto you the secrets of his dyuyn yte / for saint Myghell the archaungell said
to us / rise and go in to ye cite of Jerusalem / and be there in prayers and
gloryfye the holy resurreccyo^ of our lord Jesus christ with your brethren that
rose with you / and that ye speak to no person / but be you as domme unto the
time that our lord shall suffer you for to show the secrets of his dyuynyte /
and so ye holy angel saint Mychaell co^mau^ ded us to goo to flomiorda^ to a
place there that many are risen with us in witness of ye resurreccyon of our
lord Jesus christ. Our lord god has granted us three days to be in Iherusalem
and hold there ye holy palke of our lord god with our friends / and also that
we shall be bapt ysed in ye flomiordan each of us / at yt time making white
stools. And thus saint Myghell commasided us yt we should be in oryso^s in ye
cite of Barmathye / and ye we should she we to you these holy secrets / and
therefore give praysynge to our lord god / and be a know of your defaute / and
do penance yt he may have mercy upon you. Now peace be with you of our lord
Jesus christ that is lauyour of us all Amen.

How Nychodemus and Joseph told to Pylate all that these two me^ had said /
and how Pylate treated with the princes of the law.
ANd when this serypture was written this Garins and Leuicius rose up / and so
Gartus delivered the byll that he had written in to ye hands of Annas and
Cayphas and to Gamaliel. And Leuicius gave that he had written in to the hands
of Nychodemus and Joseph of Barmathye / and anon they were transfygured and
was no more seen / for both ye bylles were all one hand / as though one man
had wryte^ them both / and there was not one letter more in that one than in
that other. And when ye Jews and masters of ye laws had reed these bylles and
understood the^ they were hugely abashed and ashamed And than they said among
them that forsothe Jesus was very gods lone / blessed might he be endlesly
for all thing be reth witness thereof. And anon after they went out of ye
lynagoge. And than Nychodemus and Joseph of Barmathy told all this unto Pylate
and than Pylate did write all that which was befalle^ of Jesus / and of that
the Jews had said of him. And all these meruayles he did put i^ his books.
After that Pylate entered in to the Jews / and before him assembled all ye
masters of the law / as princes and byssoppes. And than Pylate did commau^de
the gates and doors to be shette / and than he said to them. Syrs it is done me
to were that ye have among you a new storye of great scripture the which
scripture I coueyte for to se / and therefore I charge you that it be brought in
to my presence. And when it was brought to his presence / than said he to them
all. I conjure you all by ye virtue of our lord which that is fader and maker
of all thing that ye ne hyde no counsel but for to say ye troth. Syrs ye
know by ye scryptures that is written here that Jesus which yt yecrucyfyed is
very gods sone / and so it be houeth him to come i^ to this world for the
health of mankind. And therefore I charge you that ye tell me what time yt christ
should come by your lcrypture. When ye Annas and Cayphas were thus coniured /
they charged and commanded that all should go out of the temple save Pylate
and them two. And than they said to Pylate good Judge thou have so coniured us
that we must needs show to the ye troth of this that thou have inquired of
us. Sir unto ye time that we had crucyfyed Jesus / we know not that he was
gods sone / but we wend that ye virtues that he wrought had been done by some
charm. Tha^ made we us assemble in this temple / and here we did reherle all
ye virtues that he had wrought. And so there were many of our lynage that said
that they had seen Jesus after his passion: and that they had herd him speak to
his dyscyples / and they said yt they law him stye in to heaven / and we law
also two men that Jesus raised fro death to life which told us many meruayles
that Jesus did in his dyenge and after / and that may ye were by three
scryptures ye we hold in our hands / but our custom is such that we do
worship to stories ye have be^ here before in our synagoges / and so we find by
witness of god in ye first book as it says ye Myghell the archaungell said to
Seth that was ye third sone of Adam when.v. M. and.v. C. year were co^plete
tha^ should ye sone of god Jesus christ come fro heaven / and yet we abede his
coming and paraue^ture this god of Isra hell that said to Moses that he should
make a hutche of wydnes in ye lenght of two cubytes and an half / and in the
lenght of a cubyte and an half / and these.v. cubytes we understand vy ye
old testament that when. v M. and.v. C year is comen / than shall Iesucryst
the sone of god come in to ye hutche / that is the womb of ye mayde^ Marye
Thus our scripture bears wytnes of him that shall be ye sone of god / and a
king of the people of Israel / but after ye passion of Jesus we and our
princes meruayled of ye tokens and words that were done by him / and so we
looked our stories and counted all ye lynage down to Joseph's lynage / and ye
lynage of Mary that was mother of Jesus / and so we have accounted that fro yt
time that god made ye world and Adam the first man unto Noes flode is two. M.
and. v C. year And fro the flode to Abraham is three. M. and. v. C. year / and
fro Moses to Dauyd is.v. C. year / and fro ye tra^smygracyo^ of Babylone to ye
incarnacyo^ of Jesus christ is four. C. year / and thus is ye accounte in all.v.
M year. All these things and maruayles did pylate write for to be read of all
them ye should come after. and than Pylate wrote a letter to the cite of Rome /
and to Claudio the Emperor. etc.

Thus ends Nychodemus gospel.
