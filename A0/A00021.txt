A Letter written out of England to an English Gentleman remaining at Padua,
containing a true Report of a strange Conspiracy, contrived between Edward
Squire, lately exec^^ed for the same treason as Actor, and Richard ^allpoole a
Jesuit, as Deviser and Suborner against the person of the Queens Majesty.

Imprinted at London by the Deputies of CHRISTOPHER BARKER, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1599.

SIR, I thank you for your Relation of Ferrara; and to make you payment in the
like commodities, I return to you a true report of a fresh accident of State,
happened here with us; memorable for the strangeness of the matter, and the
great signification it carries with it of Gods extraordinary and most visible
providence; but otherwise worthy to be damned to perpetual oblivion, as well
for the detestable nature of the fact, as yet more (if more were possible) for
the impiety of the persuasion; such as I assure you, a man ought to make
scruple to infame the times, or infect men's cogitations with the repetition of
it, were it not that these works of darkness are framed and forged in such a
deep vawte of hypocrisy, as there is more danger, that they should be
unrevealed or vnbeleeued, then that being brought to clear light, they should
provoke an imitation in any, of that which is so odious and foul.

And this Sir you may believe, that as I have had good means, to inform my
self to the full, of that which passed in this matter, and the truth of all
the particulars, as well those which were opened at the arreignment of Edward
Squire, one of the offenders, as those which were reserved, so I have set down
this Narration, rather abridged of some circumstances, then any ways amplified
or enlarged.

This Squire dwelt in Greenwich diverse years, and took upon him the practice
of a Scriuener, yet rather as a help to maintain himself for a time, then
that he bare a mind to settle in that trade. He obtained also before his going
to Sea, for some two years space, an employment about the Queens Stable, by
way of deputation to one Kaies, a Purueiour of those provisions. But being of a
wit above his vocation, disliked with that condition of life, and put himself
into action by Sea, in the last voyage Sir Francis Drake made into the Indies;
in which voyage, it was his hap, that the Frances^ (a small bark wherein he
went) was scattered from the Fleet about Guadalupe, and taken by ^iue Spanish
frigots. And so was Squire brought prisoner into Spain, where soon after he
was set at liberty.

Not long after his enlargement, he became known to Richard Walpoole an English
fugitive, and by order a Jesuit, a man of principal credit there, and a kind
of Vicar general to Parsons in his absence. This Walpoole, carrying a waking
and waiting eye, upon those of our Nation, to discover and single out sit
instruments for the greatest treasons, observed this Squire, found him a man of
more then ordinary sense and capacity, for his quality and education; found
him a man, that had passed his middle age, well advised, and yet resolved
enough, and not apprehensiue at all of danger; (for I do affirm this unto
you, that never man answered upon his trial for life and death, with less
perturbation, nay scarsely with any alteration, as if he understood not his
peril and calamity, and yet as sensible for speech, as insensible for
passion.) But besides the disposition and temper of the man, Walpoole discerned
in him two conditions of special advantage; The one, that coming into Spain
a prisoner, and not a fugitive, his return into England would be subject to
less suspicion: The other, that he understood, Squire had formerly had some
attendance about the Queens Stable, which he straight caught hold of, as an
opportunity.

Yet nevertheless, the better to prepare him, and work him to his purpose;
and the better also to give color,(when Squire should return into England)
that he was a man that had suffered in Spain for his conscience, subtly he
compassed, that upon a quarrel picked, Squire was put into the Inquisition. By
this means, when he had got his heart into his hands, mollified by distress,
and became secure of him, that he was a fixed and resolved Papist.

After probation and preparation sufficient, he began to open himself unto
him; and first for introduction, fell into the ordinary burden or song, of that
kind of people, touching the tyrannies and persecutions exercised here in
England against Catholics; though Sir, you know very well, the distinction
and moderation of the proceedings here in Ecclesiastical causes, with what
lenity, and gentleness, it has been carried, except where it was mixed with
matter of State; for else I would gladly learn, what should make the
difference, between the temper of the Laws in the first year of the Queen,
and in 23. or 27. but that at the one time, they were Papists in conscience,
and at the other they were grown Papists in faction; or what should make the
difference at this day in Law, between a Queen Mary Priest, and a Seminary
Priest, save that the one is a Priest of supers^ition, and the other is a
Priest of sedition. But to the purpose; After the Jesuit had at sundry
conferences, discoursed his pleasure of the miseries of Catholics here in
England, and of the slanders of the government, and upon how few persons
lives, the State here did stand; and Squire on the other side, (who wanted no
wit to perceive which way he was led) had first made some signification,
and after some more serious and vehement protestation of his mind and
devotion, to do service to the cause, when the wicked Friar fawe he was
gotten into the true circle, he began to charm; and yet not having the power
to fall upon the highest point first, without a gradation or bridge, It were no
doubt (says he) an act ^ery meritorious to kill the Earl of Essex, but Vnum
necessarium, One thing is necessary. And having kept him in suspense a while,
brake with him plainly, and told him, that he would put a service into his
hands, that he might execute and accomplish, without any evident peril of his
life, because it was to be done, what time the Queen her self should not be
in presence; (which I think he spoke as having heard that which is very true,
of some Conspirators, that having undertaken and vowed her Majesty's
destruction, have nevertheless at the very instant of the access and
opportunity, been stricken with astonishment, and had no power to execute
their malice.) Nay further he said, that he should not need to fear, in the
doing thereof, to be seen or observed, by any persons of care or judgment,
but such as might be easily conuersed withal, without suspicion: And it was
the impoysonment of the pommell of the Queens Sadell, at such time as she
should ride abroad; her Majesty being like to rest her hand thereupon, for a
good time together, and not unlike for her hand to come often about her face,
mouth, and nosethrils; and this by reason of his former acquaintance and
service about the Stable, he thought he might easily perform, and safely; And
yet he said, If imminent death should ensue thereupon he might not account of
it, as being assured that he should exchange his present state, with the
state of a glorious Saint in heaven. Unto which accursed proposition after that
Squire had assented, then did the Friar use all diligence to confirm and bind
him to resolution and performance. And to that end, at sundry confessions
took his vow and promise to be constant; caused him to receive the Sacrament
upon it; renewed his devilish persuasions, varying them in all fourmes to
besiege his mind and cogitations, that he might find no way to get out of
this wicked purpose; Telling him that he stood now in the state of damnation,
if he did not his uttermost endeavor to perform his vow. And bid him
remember how that sin did seldom obtain pardon; and if he did but once make
doubt of the lawfulness or merit of the act, it was enough to cast him
headlong down into hell; And if he did cast any difficulties or terrors, he
wished him to consider What it did avail a man to win the whole world, and
to leese his own soul. So as now Squire must not descend into himself, he
must make no objections, cast no doubts; but the eyes of his understanding
blinded and sealed up, he must only contemplate upon these vows and
adiurations. And for a conclusion and final benediction of this most execrable
plot, Squire kneeling before Wallpoole at confession, he lifted him up, hugde
him about the neck with his left arm (such were Squires own words) and
crossing him with the other hand after some words mumbled in Latin, said
distinctly to him in English, God bless thee and give thee strength my son;
be of good courage, I pawn my soul for thine, and thou shall have my prayers
dead and alive. And upon this imbracement and enchantment, this desperate
wretch and this blasphemous Exorcist parted for that time.

Then does he give him full instructions for the disposing of this poison;
showing him that he should receive it in a double bladder, and when it should
be used, he was to prick the bladderfull of holes upon the upper part, and
so to carry it within the palm of his hand with a thick glove for the
safeguard of his hand: and in the instant when it was to be applied, he should
turn it in his hand ^he vpside down, and so press it hard upon the pommell
of the saddell: telling him further of the nature of it, That it would lie and
tarry long where it was laid; and that it would not be checked by the air.
And lastly upon his coming away, delivered him the confection it self in such
a bladder as was before described.

This was the true manner of the subornation of Edward Squire by Richard
Wallpoole as it was confessed by the same Squire almost in the same words, as
well for the persuasions as for the instructions. Which confession I do
affirm unto you upon knowledge was delivered without torture or show of
torture: and was roundly and sensibly uttered with all circumstances of a
credible narration for that part which concerns the manner of the
impoisonment: and for that part which concerns the manner of the persuasion
was set down by an advised declaration under his own hand, and the same as
far as hitherto we have gone, was maintained and confirmed, and in no point
retracted or disauowed, either at his trial or at his death.

It seems also that Wallpoole in some of his conferences did insist upon the
impoisonment of the Earl of Essex, the rather to defeat the voyage by Sea,
then exspected (for these things past about May 1597.) So as Squire conceived
it, there could be no one thing more acceptable in the second degree.

Now after that Squire had received both poisons, as well the spiritual
poison of wicked resolution, as the material within the bladders; and that
Wallpoole had interlaced some promise to him of rewards and comforts, besides
those of the other world, and had schooled him for secrecy, which he made to
be parcel of his vow, there rested only his dispatch for England. Whereunto to
give an apt color, it was devised that there should be a permutation treated,
by the means of a Chanon in Civil of two Spanish prisoners here, taken at
Cales, friends of the said Chanon, for Squire and Rowles now Prisoner in the
Tower, who came over with him^ whereby it might be carried, far off from
suspicion, that Squire did not return as a man employed, but upon that private
occasion. According to which project he was sent away conveniently moneyed,
that he might be the better in heart, and yet not so abundantly as might make
him love his life too well, and to go away with his fare quietly, though
indeed there were more money stirring, but not in that hand.

And being arrived here in England about a fortnight before the Earls setting
forth toward the Islands, he did address himself to a Counselor of
Estate here, both to show himself to the end to avoid suspicion, and with
pretense also of some aduertisements, to the end to win the better opinion
and trust; and finding his coming well conceived of according to his desire,
he did craftily and subtilely devise with himself, that if he could find any
opportunity to execute his purpose before the Earl went, (supposing that the
poison could not work but in some space of time) it would be more security
for him to be absent, and in the voyage, left percase some suspicious tokens of
poison^ appearing, somewhat might fall out (upon such diligent inquisition as
in such a case were like to be made) to be discovered against him; and
therefore made his means to go with the Earl in his Shippe^ and obtained his
suit. So as now making his reckoning to have the peril upon his back, he did
but watch his time.

And it pleased God for the manifestation of his glory, that the Mundaie
seuennight next after Squires coming home out of Spain, he understood that
the horses were making ready for her Majesty's riding abroad. Whereupon, full
of those evil spirits wherewith so many exorcismes had possessed him, he
came into the Stable yard where her Majesty's horse stood ready sadled, and in
a familiar and cheerful manner in the hearing of diverse that stood thereby,
having all things ready according to his instructions, he laid his hand upon
the pommell of the Saddle, and said, God save the Queen, (wherein it pleased
God to take his words and not his meaning) and bruized the poison as he was
directed.

Thus was her Majesty's sacred and precious life by the All-haile of a second
Judas betrayed, the attempt put in act, and all the Conspirators part played to
the uttermost line and title; there rested only Gods part: For so it was, that
her Majesty's going abroad held; and as the Viper was upon S. Paul's hand, and
shaked off without hurt; so this done, was in July in the heat of the year,
when the poores and veins were openest to receive any malign vapor or
tincture, if her Majesty by any accident had laid her hand upon the place. And
as the Heathenish people at that time did argue and conclud^ thereupon, that S.
Paul was a God, so we may christianly infer that it was Gods doing and power
who has defended his Handmaid and servant by his secret and more then natural
influence and preservative from so actual and mortal a danger, speaking by
these signs to all her disloyal Subjects and ambitious enemies, That as he
has done great things by her, past ordinary discourse of reason, so he has
done, and will do as great things for her, beyond the course of his ordinary
providence.

For surely, if a man consider how many times her life has been sought and
assailed, since the beginning of her reign, by violence, by poisoning, by
supersticious Votaries, by ambicious Undertakers, by singular Conspirators, by
Conspirators combined, (speaking of those that have been revealed, besides a
number (no doubt) of the like which have groueled in darkness, and never came
to light) he will not find the like reflection of Gods favor in any Sovereign
Prince that has reigned.

But in the mean time you see the strange mysteries of the Jesuits doctrine
that have mingled heaven and hell, and lift up the hands of Subjects against the
anointed of God; arming them with the invisible armor of Scriptures,
Sacraments, Vows, Prayers and Blessings against their natural Soueraigns.
Wherein there is great difference between the spirit that wrought in David,
and this that works in them. For David when relation was made to him (by one
that thought he had done Saul the last good office) how Saul had fallen upon
his own sword in battle, and being in the anguish of death, and careful not
to fall alive in the hands of the Philistims a people uncircumcised desired
this soldiour to make an end of him, who did so, and was therefore by David
adjudged to die, because he dared to lay his hands upon the anointed of the
Lord: and yet was Saul a king forsaken and abandoned of God; he had taken his
mortal wound before, so as this soldiour took from him his pain, and not his
life; and it was to a good end, least a heathenish people should reproach the
name of God by insulting upon the person of Saul.

And surely for my part I do wonder that Princes do not concur in loosing
these bands, and suppressing this Sect, which makes a traffic of their
sacred lives, concluding and contracting for them with these blinded Votaries
in the secrecy of confessions and shrifts. For I do not see that Pirates
(whom the Ciuilians account to be Publici hosts societatis humanae, and
therefore Princes bound as they affirm, though they be otherwise in no league
one with an other, yea and though they be enemies, to join in the suppressing
and extirpation of them) are any such disturbers of humane society as these
are. Neither do I think, that the order of the Templers (that was put down
throughout Christendom in a few weeks) were ever offenders in so high a
degree. And I find somewhat strange that the bishop of Rome (if it were but to
avoid the aspersion of so great a slander and imputation to that Religion)
should not purge out this leaven so strange and odious.

But to return: within five or six days after this fact committed, Squire
went to Sea in the Earls own ship, and belike as Tacitus says, Ferox scelerum
quia prima prouenerant, taking the remain of the same poison with him in a
little pot in his portmantue, when the Earl was at Sea between Faial and S^
Michael, he bestowed it upon the pommels of a chair of wood, where the Earl
used to dine and sup: but thanks be to God nothing came of it neither.

Now let me acquaint you a little with the manner of detecting of this matter,
which God did likewise strangely bring about. Squire slept now in security:
for although he failed of success, yet he took himself to be out of danger:
thinking because it was carried between his Confessor and him, it could never
be revealed. But his Confessor whom it imported not so much to keep it secret
as it did Squire, tickled belike with the joy, that he had such an iron in the
fire, imparted it (for his own glory) to some principal of the fugitives
there; This raised a great expectation in them of some effect to ensue. When
time passed, and nothing came of it, they made construction of it, that Squire
had been false to them. One of the more passionate of them inueyeth bitterly
against Squire, tells how he was trusted, and how he had undone the cause; and
the better to be revenged on him, is content that one (that they let slip
hither as if he had fled from them) should give information of this matter, not
with the circumstances, but generally against Squire, partly to win himself
credit, partly to wrecke themselves on Squire. And this fellow, because he
would be thought to do the better service, would not bring this in his mouth,
but in a letter, which he pretended to have stolen out of one of their Studies.
This letter compared with another letter that the same man brought as written
from a several person, both which letters had one and the same busy knot to
both names, is suspected to be counterfeited; it is so found. Hereupon it is
collected that this was but an engine against Squire, and that he was an honest
man. Yet because it was a tender matter, Squire was sent for and examined. For
a time he denies; after, he comes to some circumstances, which concurring
with the others tale, it gave it to be understood that there was somewhat true,
and that all was not an invention against him: Hold was taken of that; and
thereupon Squire, not knowing how far his Confessor had broken trust with
him, by good persuasion, and Gods good working, disclosed all without any
rigor in the world.

^ut upon a second advise being a man of a very good reach, finding that it had
been his wisest way to have confessed the whole plot and subornation which was
known to Wallpoole, and there to have stopped, and not to have told of the
putting of i^ in execution, which was only known to himself, and which
indeed was won from him by good following, he endeavored at his arraignment
to have distinguished, and auowching the first part, to have retracted the
second; pretending that although he undertook it, yet he had not any purpose
to perform it.

Whereupon one of the Commissioners being well acquainted with all the
particular circumstances, did set before him the absurdity of his denial
against his former confession which was voluntary, particular, and needless
(otherwise then in conscience of truth) upon which speech he being stricken
with remorse, and convicted in himself, acknowledged and justified the truth
of his former confession in the hearing of all the standers by.

Thus Sir, I have interteined you with a discourse, which I think in reading
will affect you diversely, as it did me in writing; But in the end I think we
shall join in congratulating for our good deliverance, and desiring of God the
continuance of her Majesty, in whom our good days do consist.
