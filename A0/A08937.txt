of adoraco^n propre and vnpropre / also for worship of veneraco^n and so on
many manners for the unknowing whereof many men fall in doubts and errors
when they read of worshyppynge of images. ca.xiij. Offering is not made to

Diverse causes why christian people pray and worshypp god commonly eestwarde /
and that the son ne the moon be not to be worshypped of men as some fools
do. ca.xvi. Of the falsehede of Iudycyall astronomye and how it blasphemeth god
ca.xvij. What service planetes and the bodies above do to mankind / and how
god does with them what he will. Ensample of a smythe and his gryndynge stone.

ca.xxxij Wytches and Iapers yt conjure fendes compelle not fendes as it seems
that they do / ne the fend is not closed in a ring / natheles by holy

so lempne making of chirches and good arraynge of them / and that fair
service is done in chirches of England / is more of pomp and pride than to

ye poor pay a like to ye tabernacle / and y^ after diverse circu^stau^ces
sometime it is more co^uenyent to make chirches than to help poor men / and
sometime ayenwarde. ca.lij. How that many y^ grutche against making of chirches
and things longyng to chirches ben like Judas that grutched when Magdaleyne
enoynted christ / and that waste costs and pomp in such ^hynges ben to be
repreued. ca.liij. How it is vnthstande y^ christ says when y^ shall pray
enter thy chamber and^ and how with eue^ charity bet^ is to pray in chirches
than out of chirches / and so the prayer of many is better than of one alone.
ca.liiij. How processyons done for to pray for peace be not done with due

not speak much in prayer / and causes why pryncypaly men should pray in
chirches. ca.lvij. Why men pray to god not withstanding yt he is
unchangeable / and of two manner prayers one common an other synguler / and
diverse causes why men should pray by mouth. ca.lviij Why in ye beginning of

of christian faith / and yt the multitude of miracles sygnyfyed unstableness in
the faith / and rather shows y^ the people is malycyous than good. ca.lxi.
Doing of miracles is no syker preef of holiness / of the deeds of ypocrytes
/ and why god suffers false men to do woundres and miracles to begyle the
people. ca.lxij. Common solempnyte of christian buryenge is not to be forsaken /
and of the dygnyte of man's body and woman's caplm.lxiij. Feyres and markettes

ca.lxiiij.
The second commandment.
In three manners is gods name taken in vain / god is our pryncypal godfader /
for after christ we be called christian men / and if we live not crystenly we
take the name of christ in vain for myslyuynge. Ca.I. Gods name is taken in
vain by myspeche in many manners / in scornynge / in Iapynge / in erroneus
techynge / in couetouse or enuyous prechynge in bannynge of warynge / in lewd
vows making / and in brekynge of le full vows. ca.ij. Vows should be made
w^a good auysement / that Iept sinned in his vow making / and y^ wicked vows
and wicked byhel^ be to be broken. ca.iij Gods name is taken in vain by
blasphemye / by grutchynge against god / by ouerhope and wanhope / and by vayn
swery^ge / and what harm comes of customable swerynge. ca.iiij. Three false
excusaco^ns of oaths / and answers to the two first excusacyons. ca.v. In
seven cases it is lefull to swear and in every oath should three things be
kept / and so answer to the third falls excusaco^n. Also true vnderstandyuge
of textes of the new law that speak of swerynge. ca.vi. Of two manner
swerynges / of attestacyon and execracyon / and why it is forboden to swear by
creatures on y^ first manner. ca.vij. How peryllous the second manner sweryng
is / and what it is to say so help me god at the holy dome / and why men
swerynge byfor a Judge lay their hondes on a book and kiss it. ca.viij. They
that begyle men with their subtell oaths ben forsworn though they say sothe /
for in two manners may a man be forsworn in sweryng sothe. ca.ix. In six manners
may a man be forsworn / also he yt does an other to swear wytynge well that he
will forswere him synneth gretely. ca.x. How great sin it is to swear by
gods body / by gods heart / and other parts of christ / and how they
should be punysshed by law canon and law Imperyall. ca.xi. How they sin
that swear nyce oaths / as by cok / by our laken / by hode / tepat / and such
other. Also that ye truly / and nay truly ben none oaths. ca.xij It is more
sin a man to forswere him by god than by any creature. A man swerynge a
lefull thing by his hode is bound to keep his oath. A christian man may lefully
take an oath proffered of an hethen man y^ swereth by his false gods / but he
may not styre him to swear so. On what wise servants ben bounden by their
oaths to be true to their masters. ca.xiij Successors be bound to keep that
their predecessors bound them to by oath. How a man may be vnbou^de of his
oath and how not. A vow byndeth harder than an oath / though a man be clean
shreuen of dedely sin / yet may he not swear sykerly that he is not gylty /
and cause why. A man swerynge two contraryous oaths shall keep the first if it
be lefull. If he make two vows contrary y^ gretter vow shall be kept.
ca.xiiij. What vow is / of vows made in disease / of wives vows / of
childerns vows / of servants vows. A deed done with a vow is more medefull
than the same thing do without vow / of vows made under condycyon. For
four causes a man is vnbou^de of his vow. A maiden that vowed chastyte and
after is corrupt / yet she is bounden to contynence in as much as she may /
and so it is of other vows that may not fully be kept. Of vows of need and
of vows of free will. Ryghtfull cause and auctoryte of the sovereign ben
necessary in dyspensaco^n or chaungynge of a vow. The husbonde ne the wife
may not enter in to relygyon / but if that the other make perpetuell vow of
contynence / which vow is solemn / and how it lets matrymonye. Brekynge
of fast in sickness is not brekyng of abstynence. ca.xv. Of oaths made in
hastynesse / and of childre^s oaths and wives oaths. ca.xvi. Perjury is gretter
sin than ma^slaughter / and causes why that periurye is cause of much
manslaughter / and of many great harms that come of forswerynge. ca.xvij. What
penance longs by the law to forswerers / and why so great penance Also
what vengeance has fallen in England for periurye. ca.xviij Gods name is
taken in vayn by myshery^g and yt in diverse manner. c.xix Gods name is taken
in vayn by brekynge of covenant made in gods name / and confermed by
swerynge in gods name. Of the oath of Gabonytes made to Iosue / and how that
periurye is cause of hongre and many myscheues. ca.xx.
The third commandment.
On what manner god rested the seuenthe day / and six causes why god badde the
seuenthe day to be hallowed. Ca.I. Of three manner commandment / cerymonial.
Judicial. and moral. also diverse causes why ye halowynge of y^ sabot is

pryncypaly hallowed. ca.iiij. Of three manner sabotes / and causes why god badde
us have mind to halowe the sabot day. ca.v. What holy occupaco^ns men should
have an sondayes / and on other festes. ca.vi. An other cause why god badde
have mind to halowe y^ holy day. For men should so ordeyne their occupacyons
on work days / y^ they should not need to break the holy day / also which
ben seruyle works. ca.vij. Why god bade man and be to rest on y^ holy day
/ and how it is understand that god rulfylled his work in the vij. day / and
y^ mercy is fulfyllynge and perfecco^n of al gods work. ca.viij Of four
manner sabottes / and what they betokenen. ca.ix. Why the sabot in y^ old law
was more solemn than other festes of y^ time / how all the festes of the new
law ben days and sabotes of our lord specyaly the sunday. Causes why more
sole^pnyte is made and in some other festes than in common sondayes / why each
thursdaye is not hallowed as it was sometime / and of ye processyon that is done
on sondayes. ca.x. Holy days yt holy church has ordained ben to be kept /
and how the sunday though it be the.viij. day yet it is the.vij. day in
obseruaunce of the commandment. ca.xi. How the nombre of six is a parfyte
nombre / and therefore god made the world in six days / and in the sixthe day
and in the sixth age of the world he bycame man. ca.xij. Causes why god badde
rest on the vij. day / and of seven blysses that men shall have in heaven.
ca.xiij. How long the holy day should behalowed / and why men ring in
vigyles at myddaye / and how great need and pity excuse works done on holy
days / and what manner folk be excused though they travail on the holy day.

or to travail about making of chirches and how not Vytaylers and other
chapmen should not ride fro town to town to use their markettes on holy days
/ for such markett should not be holden on sondayes / neither in sanctuarye /
what hour so euensonge be said on vygyles or holy days / the holy day is to
be kept from even to even. How men should axe doubts of their curates / and
what Ignorance excuses. ca.xvi. In what manner the servant is excused of his
travail on ye holidays by the bidding of his sovereign / and to the
sovereign is halowynge of the holydaye pryncypaly boden. In what manner plays
and dau^ces ben lefull on the holy days. And in what manner men should both
mourn / and also make mirth on holidays. ca.xvij. Where it is grounded in
holy write that men may make merry and fare well on holy days / and why
fasting is defended on sondayes / why it should not be much used in pasche
time / holy wrytt shows some dau^ces and songs to be plesaunt to god / and
these two things sadness and gladness should be kept in gods service.
ca.xviij. Which ben y^ commandment of the first table / and which of y^
second / and why and how the.x. commandment be co^prehe^ded in y^ two
co^mau^dem^t of charity / how y^ three first co^mau^dem^t ben applied to the
three persons in trynyte after declarynge of this first commandment of
charity / thou shall love thy lord god with all thine he^te with all thy
soul. ca.xix. Also how we should love god with all our heart and with all our
soul and^. and how by the three first commandment we be taught faith hope and
charity / and how these three commandments teache us to love god in heart
word and deed. caplm.xx.
The fourth commandment.
All the commandments of the second table be knyt in the second
commandment of charity. Why the commandment of worshypynge fader and mother
is the first of the second table / and how they should be worshypped also of
pain yt comes to them that worship not fader and moth. E^ample of Cham the
sone of Noe. Ca.I. What myscheef comes to childern that hinder fader and mother
for their good / and of them that been vnburum to fader and mother. Example by
Absolon and Adonye. ca.ij. By example in kind we be taugh te to worship fader
and moth as of the storke and of the pellycane. ca.iij. Help at need is called
worship in holy wryt / and yt ought the child to fath and moth. What peril it
is and folly man or woman to dysmytte them of their good / and trust to their
childern. ca.iiij In what manner the child ought to hate fader and mother / and
to forsake them / and how fader and mother should help the child and the
child them at need. Example by the rote and the croppe of a tree / but the
fader and the moth have more kyndely love to their childern than ayenwarde.
ca.v. In what manner men of relygyon should help fath and moth at need.ca.vi.
The goods of holy church ben ye goods of poor men and nedy. How saint Benet
yaue goods of his covent to poor men / saint Frau^ces bade the same. ca.vij.
Goods of relygyon should be more common than other men's goods to help nedy
folk. Of the abusyon of some proud relygyouse men and their ypocrytes
excusing fro gyuynge of alms. ca.viij. Textis of holy wryt how childern
should be obedyent to fader and mother / and that good living of the child is
worship to fader and mother / and their evil living is shenshyp to fader and
mother. ca.ix. Myssuffrau^ce of childern in their youth is their shenshyp and
velonye to all their kynne / that men should chastyse their childern and teache
them to serve god. ca.x. Every man and woman is bound after his degree to do
his business to know gods law that he is bound to keep / and how each man
in some manner should teache gods law / how ye child should worship fader and
mother when they ben^deed. ca.xi. How we should worship god as pryncypall
fader and mother. ca.xij. Onre goostly faders be to be worshyped / and why they

help all nedy folk upon our power. capitulum..xxv. Why this commandment is
given with a byheste of welfare and mede. caplm..xxvi. Pride rebellyon and
vnbuxu^nesse of the people against their soueraynes / and that they will
entremet them and determyne every cause of the land and of the church is
cause of destruccyon of reames. ca.xxvij.

The tenthe commandment
What manner couetyse is forboden in the nynthe commandment and what in the
tenthe. Assent to dedely sin is dedely sin. Why the ten commandments
that forbede the deed of lecherye and of theft stand before the
commandments that forbede wicked will of lecherye and theeft. Ca.I. Cause of
dyuersyte why the two last commandments ben transposed Exodi.xx. and
Deuto.v. ca.ij. Mind of crystus passion is remedy against temptacyons of
lecherye. Example by the pellycane. Of the love of christ / and how it
quenches uncle ne love. ca.iij. Diverse remedies against lecherye and remouynge
of occasyons. Example by two holy wymen. ca.iiij. A man should rule his flesh
as a knight does his horse / and of goostly sadell brydell and spores. ca.v.
How a christian man is like a bird that is called a bernake. How every christian
man is a knight / and with what armure he should be armed. As much as a man
keeps gods commandments so much he is in gods sight and no more. All
that break gods commandments ben accursed by y^ great sentence of god.
ca.vi.and.vij Of myscheues and curses temporal and endelesse that shall come
to the brekers of gods law. Common myscheue falls not to a comontee but for
sin of the comontee. Why tho six sons of Jacob that were assygned to bliss
/ were assygned to that office / and why the other six to curse. And that
prelates should not curse but for great need. ca.viij. Of welthe and blessing
temporal and endless that is behyght to the kepers of gods law / and of the
Joy and bliss that is in heaven. ca.ix. Heaven is lykened to a cite. Of the
worthynesse of the people of this cite and of the bliss that is therein. ca.x.
Heaven is understand by the Cite that saint Johan speaks of in the Apocalypse /
and of the goostly expownynge thereof. ca.xi.and.xij. Why that men have no sad
faith to believe that there is so great a bliss by example of a child born in
prison A little taste of heaven bliss tourneth all erthely Joy to bytternesse

dives and pauper



Of holy pouerte.
Capitulum. Primum.
Dives et Pauper obuiaueru^t sibi. vtriusque operator est dn^s. Prouerbi. xxij.
These ben y^ words of Solomon / thus much to say in English. The rich and
the poor met to gydre / the lord is fourmer of them both. This text
worshypfull Beda expowneth thus. A rich man is not to be worshypped for this
cause oonly that he is rich / neither a poor man is to be despised because of
his pouerte but the work of god is to be worshypped in them both / for they
both ben made to the image and to the likeness of god. And as it is written
Sapiencie vij. ca. One manner of entering in to this world / and a like manner
of outgooynge fro this wretched world is to all men both rich and poor. For
both rich and poor comen in to this world naked and poor / weeping and
weylyng / and both they departen hens naked and poor with much pain.
Nevertheless the rich and the poor in their lyuynges in this world in many
things ben full unlike. For the rich man habou^deth in tresour of gold and
silver and other richesses. He has great honors and erthly delytes / where
the poor creature lives in great penury and pain / and for lackyng of
richesses suffers cold and honger / and is often in despyte. Pauper. I that am
a poor caytyfe simple and little set by / beholding the prosperyte of them
y^ ben rich / and the disease that I suffer and other poor men like unto me
am many a time steryd to grutche and to be weary of my life. But thanne re^nen
to my mind the words of Solomon before rehearsed / how the lord made as well
the poor as the rich. And thereto Job witnesses / that nothing in earth is
made without cause Job.v. Then I suppose within my self / that by y^ preuy
domes of god that be to me unknown / it is to me prouffytable to be poor. For
well I wot that god is no nygarde of his gifts But as the apostle says
Rom^.viij. To them that been chosen of god all things werken to gydre in to
good. And so sythen I trust thorugh the goodness of god to be one of his
chosen I can not deem but yt to me it is good to be poor. Moreover saint
Poule.i. Thimoth.vi. writes in this manner. They that will or desire to be made
rich fall in to temptaco^n and in to the snare of the devil / and in to many
desires vnprouffytable and noyous. For coue tyse of richesses more than is
needful to a man for to have / is rote of all euylles. Experyence accords
with this saw of the apostle. For lesynges and periuryes / falls subtyltees and
gyles / and many other wyckednesses ben as common as the cartewaye with such
inordynate lovers of richesse / which sins bry^ge them to endelesse
perysshynge / but if they be wasshen away before the hour of death with great
and bitter penance. It is an old proverb. He is well at ease that has
enough and can say ho. He has enough as holy doctors say to whom his
temporell gods be they never so few suffysen to him and to his / to find
them that them needs. I know well that as saint Poule says in the place
before reherced / and Job says the same Job.i. Naked we come in to this world
/ we bring no richesse with us / ne none shall we bear with us when we shall
pass fro this world as is also before said. Nevertheless whiles we live here
we may not utterly cast all temporal goods away / wherefore after the
Informacyon of this holy man Poule in the same chapter / have I health and
simple lyuelode. I purpose through gods grace to hold me content / and never
besye me to keep togydre habondau^ce of worldely richesses.

Caplm secundu^.
Dives. Thou art the more fool. But it is a common proverb A foles bolte is
soon shot. Abide and answer and I will ley an hundred pound that I shall
preue the by good argument y^ he is but a fool which will not besye him to be
rich. And that thou be not in doubt of what richesse I speak / worldly
richesse or ghoostely. I do the out of doubt I speak of worldly richesse.
Pauper. I will neither strive ne leye wageours / but if it like your benygnyte
/ to talk with me a simple caytyfe. I will lowly admytte your comynyng. Say
what ye will. Dives. God made Adam and mankind lord of all erthely things
when he said Gen^.i. Dominamini piscibus maris and^. Be ye lords he said of
the fysshes of the sea / and of the birds of the air / and of all things
that live and styre upon earth. Now to a lord it longs for to be rich.
Sythen than lordshyppe perteyneth by kind unto man / and so suynly to be rich
/ how may thou deny but that he is a fool that will not besye him to be
rich. For who is a more fool than he yt will not besye him to keep gods
ordenau^ce / what canste thou say to this Pauper. Lordshyppe is taken in
diverse manners. There is naturell or kyndely lordshyppe. There is also cyuyle or
seculer lordshyp. And there is lordshyp pretense. Of naturell lordshyp speaks
the scripture that ye alleged. For god ordained in the state of Innocencye man
kyndely to have soueraynte over bestes fyshes and birds. And this manner of
lordshypp ordained by way of kind may a Just man have without habondaunce of
worldely richesse. To seculer or cyuyle lordshyppe Introducte by occasyon of
sin perteyneth worldely richesse / which manner lordshyp longs to kings /
dukes / earls / and other lower lords. If I that am a poor wretch should
besye me to get such lordshyp / of holy scripture ne of holy doctors I wot
well praysynge get I none. Dominiu^ or lordshyp pretends to have tyrau^tes
and falls oppressors over the people / which manner of lordshyp god forbede
that ever I desire. Sir if ye mark well this dystynccyon and this simple
short answer ye shall clearly see that your argument is but feeble and preueth
not me to be a fool because that I besye me not to have worldely richesse.

Caplm.iij.
Dives. What sayste thou than to this. Christ Ihesus said thus. Beacius est
magis dare quam acciere. Ac^.xx. It is he says more blysfull to give than to
take. But the rich man may better give than may the poor / for he has more
whereof. Ergo it is more blysfull to be rich than to be poor / but he yt will
not besye hy^ to have the better part is a fool. Ergo nu^c tibi concludi^. Now
thou art concluded. Pauper. That christ says may not be false. But ye rich
men take full much and give oftentyme full little for the love of god. Ye take
the great and give the small / ye take much more than takes y^ poor. And
the more that ye take to harder ye be bounden / and to harder rekenyng ye mus^e
give. For as says Gregorye. Quanto dona crescunt tanto crescunt raciones
donorum. The more that gifts increase / the more increase rekenynges of gifts
/ and saint Poule says to the rich man. Quid habes quoth no^ accepisti What have
thou / that thou have not received of god / right not but sin. So ye rich
men ben all on the taking side / and little on the yeuyng side. The poor man
takes but little / and gives full much. For one penny given of the poor man
is more in gods sight in case / than twenty pound given of the rich. And
therefore Christ says in the gospel Luce.xxi. that the poor wydowe which
offered but two mytes in the Temple / that is but one ferthynge / she offered
more than did all men and wy^men that day / and yet it was full great
offryng. For as christ says she offered all that she had to live by. Other
men might have offered much more than they did and not have been the worse. And
as touching crystus words which ye allegge. Beacius est dare and^. It is more
blysfull to give than to take. Worshypfull Beda says upon the same text.
Ac^.xx. The lord he says prefers not by these words rich men that give
alms / before them that forsake all things and sue Christ. But Christ
commends them most which forsake worldely richesse and travail
nevertheless with their hondes with such lytyl as they may get Justly to
help the poor nedy. Or else it may be understand thus. That to every man be
he rich be he poor / if he have any thing which he may forbere / it is
better to hy^ with such as he may to help other that been poor and nedy /
than him self to take gifts of other men Moreover sythen the poor wydowe
that offered but.ij. mytes gaaf so great a gift because of her good will. A man
that forsakes the world / and gives away all that he has for the love of
god / and also forsakes therewith couetyse of having / save oonly that him
bare needs / because that he so dyscarged him of worldely business / may be
the more ghoostly occupied he gives a full great gift / ye so great a gift
that a rich man as he keeps his richesse with couetyse may not give so much
as such a poor man gives. Ergo sir by your own words such a poor man is
more blessed than many that been full rich.

Caplm.iiij.
Dives. If all men were as poor as thou art thou sholdest fare full evil.
Pauper. If all men were so rich as ye ben / ye should fare much worse / who
should tyle your lord / hold your plough / repe your corn keep your bestes /
who should shape your clothes or sewe them / what myllare would than grynde
your corn / what baker bake you bread / what brewer brewe your ale / what coke
dyght your mete / what smyth or carpenter amend your house and other things
necessary / ye should go sholesse and clothelesse / and go to your bed
metelesse / all must ye than do allone. If ye had a wife much woe should she
have. And if ye had none ye should be wretch of all wretches. There should
noman well do any thing for you. Therefore says saint Austyn. Quod dives and
pauper su^t duo sibi necessaria. The rich and the poor ben two things full
necessary each to other. And I say moreover the rich man has more need than
ye poor. Dives. How pryuest thou that. Pauper. Have a poor man simple
lyuelode / simple mete / simple drink / and other simple things / and few
necessaryes to him / it suffyseth to his person and to his astate / he cares
not but for him self or for few mo. But the rich man carith for his person
for his astate / for his great meyne / for his worship / for his goods. He
has need of much gold and silver / much meyne / many vytayles. He has need
of many men's help / of servants / of laborers / men of craft / of men of
law / of great lordshyp without which he may not mayntene his astate ne his
richesse The poor needs but little of all this He that much has byhoueth
much. And he that has less byhoueth less. The rich man must give to his
friends to have their assystence / and their help. He gives his enemies to
let their malice. And so of much richesses he gives but little for to
help his soul with. The poor man of little may give little and has much
thank of god. So the rich man needs more and has more need and myschyef
than has the poor man. For the more that he has / the more him needs / and
in more myschyef and in more perell he is night and day. For as the house that
stands high on a hylle is in more tempest than the house in the valaye. So
men of high dygnyte and great rychesses in high worshyppes ben in most dread
and most disease. And therefore god says to the proud covetous rich man.
Thou hold the full rich / thou see that thou have need of no good / and
thou know not how wretched thou art / how myschyeuous / how blind poor and
naked. Apoc.iij.

Caplm.v.
Dives. Thou magnefyest much pouerte. Pauper. Crystus words must needs be
true Beati pau^es ^m^ vrm^ est regnu^ celorum Luce.vi. Blessed he says be ye
poor men / for yours is the kingdom of heuens. And in an other place he says
thus to the poor / ye that have forsake all these worldely richesses for the
love of me and have followed me / shall syrte on twelve thrones at the day of
dome / and deem the twelve kynredes of Israel. That is to say / all that
shall be demed quycke or deed. And therefore rich men do ye as Christ byddeth
you in the gospel. Make ye the poor men your friends of the deuyllessheyf
either richesses of wickedness / that the poor men may resceyue you in to
dwellynges of endelesse bliss. Either ye must be poor or beg heaven of the
poor if ye will come to heaven. Dives. Why calls Christ richesse richesses or
a deuyllessheyf of wickedness. Pauper. For couetyse of richesse makes folk
to serve the devil / and bring them to sin and to shrewednesse. Dives. This
is full wonderful to the rich folk for to here. Pauper. We find Machei.xix.
That there came a young man to our lord and axed him what he should do to have
the life that ever shall last. Christ answered. Serua mandata. Keep the
commandments. Slay no man. Do no folly by no woman. Stele not. Bear no false
witness. Worship fader and mother Love thy neighbor as thy self. Lord said
he all these have I do / what lacks me yet. Than said Christ. If thou will
be perfyght / goo and selle all that thou haste and give it to the poor folk
/ and come and follow me. But as says the gospel when he herd these words
he went away full sorry / for he had many possessions and much richesses.
Than Christ said to his dyscyples. It is full hard the rich man to enter in
to ye kingdom of heuens it is more easy said he a Camele to pass through nedels
eye / than ye rich man to enter in the kingdom of heuens. Than his dyscyples
said to Christ. Lord who may than be save. Christ answered and said. That as
anentes man it is Impossyble / but to god all thing is possible. Dives. These
words sound full hard to mine understanding / and soon may bring me and
such other in dyspayre. I pray the declare me this manner of speech if thou
can. Pauper. Some exposytoures of the words of Christ say that in Iherusalem
was a little pryue yate which for straytnesse was called the nedell. when the
Cameles came ycharged to this yate they might not enter but they did away
their burdeynes and their packes. And so by these words Christ excludes not
you rich men from heaven. But he techeth you how ye may enter the yates of
heaven. For as he says in the gospel. The yate and the way that ledeth to
life and bliss is full strayte / and few pass thereby. And so by this nedell
is understand the entering in to heuens bliss. By the Camele charged / y^
rich men that been charged with the richesse of the world / which charge as
long as it is fast upon them. So long they may not enter in to the bliss
of heaven. For Christ says in the gospel. Nisi quis renunciauerit omnibus que
possidet / non potest meus esse discipulus. But a man forsake all that he has
/ he may not be my dyscyple. And therefore if thou enter in to the strayte yate
of heaven / thou must unbind and louse thy charge (...) richesse from the /
and leye it besides the under foot / to that thou be lord and master of thy
richesses / and not the richesses thy master.

Caplm.vi.
Dives. How should I louse my richesses fro me. Pauper. As the prophet says.
Diuicie si affluant nolite cor apponere. If richesse and welthe fall to the /
set not thyn heart to much thereon. Love them not to much. Be ready to
thank god when he sent them to the / and as ready to thank him pacyently /
if he take them fro the / and say as Job said. Nudus egressus sum de vtero
matris me. Naked came I in to this world out of my moders womb / and naked I
shall go hens again. Sythen we than have taken goods of richesses and of
wealth of gods hand / why should we not suffer pacyentely woe and disease if
he send them to us. God gaaf me goods / and god has taken them away / as
god would so is it done / blessed be gods name. Job primo. Vnlouse so thy
richesses from the / that in gods cause thou be redye for to forsake all that
thou haste rather than thou sholdeste offend thy god. So that for no
winning neither for no loss thou woldeste do any dedely sin. Always be
ready rather to forsake thy goods than thy god. And in this manner must every
man forsake all that he has if he will be Crystus dyscyple. That is for to
say / he must withdraw his heart and his love from all that he has / so
that he love no thing as much as god / ne in lettynge of his love neither of
his worship. For who someuer that will be saved / he must be poor in
spyryte and in will. And therefore says Christ in the gospel. Beati pauperes
spiritu quoniam ipsorum est regnum celorum. Blessed ben they that been poor in
spyryte and in will. For theyrs is the kingdom of heuens. All though this
exposycyon as touching the moral sense be fulle true and fair. Nevertheless
doctor de lyra because it has none auctory^e of holy scripture / that there
was such a yate a^te Iherusalem that was called a nedell / expowneth the
words of Christ in an other manner and says / that Christ speaks in that
text of rich men that set their bliss and their trust in richesse /
wherefore this is the menynge of the text as lyre says. As it is Impossyble
for a Camele to pass thorugh the eye of a nedell. So it is Impossyble for a
man that sets his trust and his bliss in richesses for to enter in to the
royalme of heuens. But if he cast from him such inordynate love and trusting
in richesse And that these words of Christ should thus be understand / the
same doctor preueth by Crystus own words in an other place Marci.x. where
our lord says thus. How hard it is yt men trusting in richesse to enter in
to the royalme of god. It is easyer or lyghter that a Camele pass thorugh the
eye of a nedell / than a rich man for to enter in to the kingdom of god / yt
is to say so trusting in his richesses / Inordynatly them loving.

Caplm.vij.
Dives. I assente to this exposycyon. I was aferde that god had not loved
rich men. Pauper. Abraham Ysaac and Jacob y^ holy patryarkes were full rich
men and yet god loved them full well. Dauyd Ezechie and Iosie were kings of
gods people / much loved and praised of god. Joseph Danyell rulers of
royalmes were of god chosen. Job Iachee Joseph of Aromathye were full rich men
/ and now ben full high in bliss. For ye rich men be not lacked in holy write
for their richesses / but for her wicked couetyse and myswyll of richesse. And
therefore says saint Ambrose super Lucam / that the fault is not in the
richesse / but in them that can not use their richesse in due manner. And
therefore says he / that right as richesse is lettyng of virtue to wicked men /
so it is helping of virtue to good men. Ne poor men be not praised so much
in holy write for wantynge of richesse / ne for myschyef that they ben in / but
for their good will and their good love that they have to god. When for his
love they forsake richesse / and put them in pouerte and myschyef to serve
their god the more freely without lettyng of worldely couetyse. For more shrewes
find I none than poor beggars that have no good that the world has forsake
/ but they not the world. Dives Therefore me thinks always that it is better
to be rich than poor. For pouerte and myschyef draw many a man to robbery /
manslaughter / and lecherye / and other sins many moo. And therefore says
Solomon, Propter inopiam multi deliqueru^t. Ecclesiastes.xxviij. Pauper. Some
be poor and nedy by their good will / and some against their will. And they
that been poor against their will / some have pacyence / and some have no
pacyence / and they because of myschyef they lightly fall in sin But neither
pouerte wylfully taken for the love of god / ne pouerte that falls to man
against his will / brings man to sin if he have pacyence. More over I say
that couetyse of richesse is more cause of sin than pouerte. And therefore
says saint Poule that couetyse is rote of all manner wickedness. And the poor
man dare not / ne may not sin / ne mayntene his sin as the rich man may.
For he may sooner be punysshed and chastysed than the rich man. Also there is
need of pouerte and need of couetyse. For as Solomon says / the coueytous man
has never enough / but for myschyef of her te he leseth his soul. And of this
myschyef and need speaks Solomon y^ words that thou alleggest.

Caplm.viij.
Dives. I here by thy talkyng thou art a lettred man / what can thou say to
the words of Solomon Proverb.xxx. Where he prayed thus. Mendicitate^ and
diuicias ne dederis michi / ne egestate compressus periure^ nomen dei. Lord he
says give me neither great richesse ne beggary that I be not constrained by
need to for swear my gods name / and holy church syngeth and says. Diuicias
and paupertates ne dederis michi. Lord says he give me no great richesse /
ne great pouerte whereby as me thinks each man should be besye to flee pouerte
beggary and myschyef. Pauper. I pray the be as besye to forsake thy richesse
by ensample of Solomon / as thou art to fersake pouerte and beggerye. For in
his prayer in which be contained moo words than thou rehersest / he forsook
both richesse and beggary. But thou do as many men done / thou alleggest
the scripture as the list / and applyest it to thy fantasye / and leuest
behind what the list which is against thy fantasye. The hole prayer of
Solomon is this. Mendicitatem et diuicias ne dederis michi. Tribue tantum
victui meo necessaria. Ne forte saciatus illiciar ad negandum / et dicam quis
est dominus / et egestate compulsus furer et periurem nomen dei mei. Beggary he
says and richesse ne give thou not to me / give thou oonly to my lyuelode
needful things. Lest perauenture I fulfilled be drawn to deny / and say
who is the lord. And through need constreyned stele / and forswere the name
of my god. After the exposycyon of Beda and Lyra in this text Solomon prays
to god that he be not so filled with richesses / that he for pride and
habondaunce of worldly goods forgete his god and endeles goods Also on that
other side that vnpacyence of pouerte compelle him not to stele neither to
forswere him. In which prayer he refuses no more pouerte / than he does
habondau^ce of richesse. But his prayer Indyfferentely beholds great richesse
/ and much pouerte. Also sir saaf thy pacyence / thou rehersest the words of
Salomons prayer with false English and not conuenyent. For he said not give
me neither richesse ne beggerye as thou saydeste. But he said give me richesse
and beggerye. That is to say / give me not richesse with nygardshyppe and
straytnesse of heart and couetyse / which make the rich man always to beg
and crave. For as I said Ecclesiastes the.v. ca. The nygarde has never enough.
And so by these words he prays to god that if he give him richesse / that
he should give him therewith largeness of heart / and grace to spend them to
gods worship / and to have good of his good by his life. For as he says
Ecclesiastes.vi. It is a great myschyue and a great vanyte that god gives a
man richesse / and goods enough what he will have. And with that he gives
him no power for nygardshyp to have part thereof / but keeps them to the
stranger / which shall devour all that he gets with much care. Against
this myschyef and beggary of couetyse. Solomon made his prayer saying to the
lord / give me not richesse and beggerye together. For such nygardshyppe and
beggerye makes rich men to forsake their god. So it is understand of
beggerye and pouerte ye comes of myscouetyse / not of pouerte and beggerye
that comes of need and wantynge of good. For the rich man needs more to
beg bodily than the poor. Dives. That is false. Pauper. I preue it. Dauyd
that worthy king said. Ego autem mendicus sum et parper. I am said he a beggar
and a poor man / where as the gloss says thus. Beggyng is to axe a thing of
an other that he has not of him self. But the rich man needs more than the
poor for to axe help of an other as I showed here before. Ergo it needs him
more for to beg than the poor man. Dives. All though we axe help of other
men as us needs all / yet we pay them for their trauaylle and for their good
/ and therefore it is no beggerye / but a couenaunte making / payeng / byeng /
and selling. Pauper. Full often ye pay full evil. Thou askeste for the love
of the penye / and a poor nedy man axeth for the love of god. Thou profferest
men of whom thou axest bodily help the penye to their need / and god
prouffereth him self to mede to them that help poor men. Dives. All we be
beggars goostly as says saint Austyn / for we have no good goostly but of
gods gift. Pauper Ergo we be all beggars bodily / for we have no good
bodily but of gods gift.

Caplm.ix.
Dives. Thy speech is reasonable / but not much pleasant to many rich. folk.
I pray the what is thy name. Pauper. why ask thou. Dues. Twenty year a goo
I spoke with a man of thyn astate that was full like the in speech and person.
But he spoke of so high perfeccyon as thou now begynnest for to do / that unto
this day I could never atteyne thereto. And he told me the same tale of that
young man that thou toldest me now. Pauper. Of whicht young man. Dives. Of hy^
that asked Christ what he should do to have the bliss withouten end. To whom
Christ taught him that perfecco^n that thou spekest of / and yet he did it not
no more than I do. Pauper. There is two manner of perfeccyons / of which Christ
spoke and taught yt young rich man. There is perfeccyon less / and perfecco^n
more. The first is needful and suffycyent. The second is a passing holiness
and full excellent. Of the first god says. Perfectus eris sine macula. Glosa
criminali. Deu^.xviij. Thou shall says he be perfyte without spotte of dedely
sin. Of this perfeccyon spoke Christ to that young rich man when he bad him
keep the commandments. Of the second perfecco^n that is so excellent / he
said to him. Si vis perfectus esse and^. If thou wylt be perfyte / go and selle
all that thou haste and give it to the poor folk and come and follow me.
Dives. The same tale told me thy brother twenty year paste But we spoke than
most of the high perfeccyon of excellencye. I pray the let us now speak a
while of the less perfeccyon that is needful to all. For sythen I may not
atteyne to the more perfeccyon. I would as we must keep and hold well the
less perfeccyon. Pauper. Do than as Christ taught that young rich man. Serua
mandata. Keep well the commauadementes. Have one god in worship. Take not his
name in ydelnesse. Halowe the holy days. Fader and mother worship and pay.
Slay no man. Do no folly by no woman. Look that thou stele not. And no false
witness that thou bear. Coueyte thou not thy neighbors good with wrong house
ne land. Desire not his wife ne his child. ne his servant / ne his be /
ne onythynge that to him longs. These ben the.x. commandments which god
wrote in.ij. tables of stone / and took they^ Moses for to teache them to the
people. The three first commandments were written by them self in the first
table. For tho pryncypaly teache us how we should worship our god / and love hy^
above all thing / and therefore they ben called the three commandments of the
first table. The other.vij. ben called of the second table / for they were
written in the second table. And they teache us how we should worship and love
our even christian as our self And so all the.x. commandments ben
comprehended in the two commandments of charity. Dives. Which ben tho.
Pauper. The first is that you shall love thy lord god with all thyn heart with
all thy mind / with all thy might The second is that you shalt love thy
neighbor as thy self / that is to say thou shalt love him to ye same bliss
that you love to thy self / and do to him as you would men did to the / and
not do to him but as you would men did to the / as long as he keeps the
law of charity. For and if he forfete and do against charity it is charity to
chastyse him and punysshe him till he will amend hy^ for saluaco^n of his
soul / and ensample of other. In these two commandments as Christ says in
the gospel hangs all the law and all the prophecye. And therefore saint
Poule says that love and charity is fulfyllynge of all the law.

Caplm.x.
Dives. Me meruaylleth much why Christ taught more that young rich man the
commandments of the second table / than of the first / and why he taught
him more how he should love his neighbor / than he should love his god. For
neither christ spoke to him of the first commandment of charity / how he
should love his god above all thing / ne how he should have one god in
worship / ne how he should flee periurye / ne that he should halowe the holy
days. And yet without keeping of these may no man be saved. Pauper. When Christ
bad him keep the commandments in general / he bad him keep the.x.
commandments and the two commandments of charity / and al gods hestes
and his laws But he specyfyed more the commandments of ye second table
than of the first / and more the second commandment of charity than the
first / not that he was more bound thereto / but for he was more enclyned
because of youth / of richesses / and of lordshyp to forfet against tho
commandments than ayenste the other in the first table. For youth is
enclyned to wrath / hastynesse / fighting / and so to manslaughter / to
lecherye / auoutrye / to lyenge / and so to false witness / to theeft / to
pride and rebellyon / to indygnaco^n / to despyte of his elder. And so in many
wise offends his neighbor and his even christian. And namely when youth is
under set with richesse / and is at his own rule without dread of punysshyng
/ as that young man was. For he was full rich and he was a prince leder and
ruler of the contre / as says saint Luke in his gospel. And therefore Christ
most sovereign leche / not oonly taught him how he should live withouten end
/ but moreover he warned him to what sickness he was most dysposed to /
whereby he might lose that life and deye withouten end / and taught him
medycynes against tho sekenesses / when he bad him not slay / do no lecherye /
no theft / bear no false witness / worship fader and mother / and in his
reulynge love his neighbor as him self / and do to him as he would men did
to him. Dives. Why specyfyed not Christ to him the two last commandments of
the second table which be against false couetyse. Pauper. For young folk be
not so much enclyned to couetyse as they be to other sy^nes. Dives. That is
sothe / for couetyse reygneth most in old folk. And so as men wexe in age so
increases their couetyse. And when all other sins forsake man for elde and
feblenesse / than couetyse is most breme. Pride is first in youth / couetyse
last in age. Say forth what thou will.

Caplm.xi.
PAuer. Evermore thou shall understand that there be two manner of lives by y^
which man may be saved. The first is contemplatyfe / the second actyfe. The
first stondeth pryncypally in business to know god and gods laws / and to
love him above all thing. The second stondeth pryncypally in good deeds and
good rule and help of our even christian. The three first co^mau^dementis of the
first table belongs to all / but pryncypally to them that been in contemplatyf
life that have forsaken the world and worldely business for the love of god.
The seven commandments of the second table also longen to al. but
pryncypally to them yt ben in actyfe life and in business of the world. The
contemplatyf life is in ease and rest of heart. The actyf life is in doing and
traueyll and business of body and soul. And of this life spoke yt young rich
man when he said. Lord what shall I do / how shall I live to have the life
withouten end. And Christ taught hy^ what good deeds he should do / what
misdeeds he should flee / if he would keep well the actyfe life. Also you shall
understand for this speech of christ and many such other / yt christ in y^
gospel and holy write by example of y^ less preueth and shows y^ more. As
when he says yt men should be saved at ye day of dome for they gaaf mete to
the hungrye / drink to the thrustye / much more than should they be saved
that gave all that they had or might have for the love of god / and hem self
to serve god night and day body and soul / and put them to the death for his
love. And they also that feed man's soul with bread of gods word. And sith
they shall be dampened that will not give to the poor folk mete and drink for
gods sake / mochemore should they beda^pned y^ rob men of their life and
lyuelode / and they y^ done lecherye / auoutry manslaughter / robbery / and
other horrible sins. And on the same manner when Christ specyfyed to that
rich man / the commandments of the second table / and the second
commandment of charity. He shows that sythen tho were so necessary to
have the life withouten end. Much more the commandments of the first table
and the first commandment of charity ben necessary to all that will have
y^ life withouten end. Dives. Therefore would I feign keep them better thanne
I have done / but I see many doubts therein that I can not keep them. Pauper.
What doubt haste thou therein.

Here begins the first commandment.
Caplm Primu^.
Dives. In the first commandment as I have learned / god says thus. Thou
shalt have none other strange gods before me. Thou shalt make to the no
graven thing / no mawmette / no likeness that is in heaven above / ne that
is bynethe in earth / ne of any thing that is in the water under therthe. Thou
shall not worship them with thy body outward / ne within thyn heart
inward. Exodi.xx.c. So by this me thinks that god forbedeth making of
images and worshyppyng of them and yet men do make images these days great
plente / both in the church and without the church. And all men as me think
worship images. And it is full hard to me but I do in that as all men done.
And if I worship them me thinks I do ydolatrye ayenste gods law.
Pauper. God forbedeth not men to make images / For he bad Moses make images of
two aungellys that be called cherubyn in the likeness of two young men / as we
find Exodi.xxxvij.c. And Solomon made such and many mother to in the Temple
to the worship of god / the third book of kings.vij.c. And god bad Moses
make his tabernacle and all that longs thereto after she ensample and the
likeness that was showed to him upon the hylle / when he was there with
god.xl. days and xl. nyghtes. Exodi.xxv. And therefore god forbedeth not
utterly the making of images / but he forbedeth utterly for to make images for
to worship them as gods / and to set their faith their trust / their
hope / their love / and their believe in them. For god will have man's heart
hole knytte to him allone / for in him is al our help and all our saluaco^n.
And therefore we must worship him and love him / and trust in him above all
thing / and nothing worship but him or for him. That all the worship that
we do to any creature be do pryncypaly for hy^ and arrected to him. For he
says. Gloriam meamalteri non dabo / et laudem meam sculptilibus. Ysaye.xlij. I
shall not give my worship / my bliss / my glory to none other / ne my
praysynge to graven images / neither to painted images. And in the same
chapter he says Shamfully shente might they be all that set their trust in
to graven images. Dives. whereof serve the images. I would they were burnt all.
Pauper. They serve for three things. For they be ordained to stere man's mind
to think on Crystus Incarnacyon / and on his passion / and on his living /
and on other saints living. Also they ben ordained to styre man's affection /
and his heart to devotion. For often a man is more stered by sight than by
heryng or redynge. Also they be ordained to be a token and a book to the lewd
people / that they may read in ymagerye and paynture / that clerks read in the
book as the law says. De co^secra. distinct.iij. per latu^. Where we find
that a bishop destroyed images as thou woldeste do / and forfended that no
man should worship images. He was accused to the pope saint Gregorye which
blamed him gretely for that he had so destroyed the images / but utterly he
praised him for he forfended them to worship images.

Caplm secundu^.
Dives. How should I read in the book of paynture and of ymagerye. Pauper. when
you see the image of y^ crucyfixe / think on hy^ y^ deyed on y^ cross for
thy sin and thy sake / and thank him for his endless charity that he would
suffer so much for the. Take heed by the image how his head was crowned with a
garlonde of thorns till they went in to the brain / and the blood braste out
on every side / for to destroy the high sin of pride / that shows most
in man's head and womannes and make an end of thy pride. Take heed by the
image how his arms were spradde abroad and drawn fulle strayte upon the tree
tylle all the veins and all the synowes craked. And how his hondes were
nailed to the cross and stremed out blood for to destroy the sin that Adam
and Eve did with their hondes when they took the apple against gods
commandment. Also he suffered this to destroy the sin of wicked deeds / and
wicked works / that men and wymen do with their hondes / and make an end of
thy wicked works. Take heed also how that his side was opened / and his heart
cloven in two with the sharp spear / and how he shed blood and water / to
she we that if he had had more blood in his body more he would have given
for man's love. He shed blood the raunsonne of our souls / and water to
wasshe us from our sins. Also he suffered this for to destroy y^ sin of
pride / couetyse / envy / hate / wrath / and malice that reygne in man's
heart and woman's. Take heed and make an end of thy pride / of thy false
couetyse / of hate / envy / wrath / and malice / and forgive thyn even christian
for his love that forgave his death. Take heed also by the image how his fete
were nailed to ye cross and stremed on both to destroy the sin of sloth
in gods service / and make an end of slouthe in gods service / and haste
the for to go to gods house and to gods service. Take heed also by the
image how his body was to rent and all to torn / with tho sharp scourges
that fro the sole of the foot unto the top of the head / there was no hole
place on his body / and that was for to dystroye the sin of lust and lykyng
of the flesh / glotonye and lecherye / which regne in man's body and
woman's / and make an end of glotony and lecherye. Take heed how naked and
poor he henge upon ye cross for thy sin and thy sake / and be thou not
ashamed to suffer pouerte and myscheyf for his love. And as saint Bernard
byddeth / take heed by the image how his head is bowed down to the all ready to
kiss the and come at one with the. See how his arms and hondes be spradde a
broad on the tree / in token that he is ready to halse and clyppe the and kiss
the / and to take the to his mercy. See how his side was opened / and his heart
cloven on two / in token that his heart is always open to the / and redye to
love the and to forgive the all thy trespass / if thou will amend the and
axe mercy. Take heed also how his fete were nailed full hard to the tree / in
token that he will not flee away from the / but abide with the and dwelled
with the withouten end. On this manner I pray the read thy book and fall
down to the ground / and thank thy god that he would do so much for the /
and worship him above all thing / not the image / not the stock / stone /
ne tree / but him that deyed on ye tree for thy sin and thy sake / so that
thou knele if thou will before the image / not to the image. Do thy worship
before the image / not to the image. Make thy prayer before the image but not to
the image / for it sees the not / it hereth the not / and it understands the
not. Make thyn offrynge if thou will before the image / but not to the image.
Make thy pilgrimage not to the image ne for the image / for it may not help
the / but to him and for him that ye image represents to the For if thou do
it for the image / or to the image thou do ydolatrye.

Caplm.iij.
Dives. Me thinks that wha^men knele before the image pray and look on the
image / with weeping teeres / bou^che or knock their brestis with other such
contenau^ce / they do all this to the image / and so weneth much people.
Pauper. If they do it to the image / they sin gretely in ydolatrye against
reason and kind. But as I said before / they may do all this before the image
and not to the image. Dives. How might they do all this before the image /
and not worship the image. Pauper. Often thou see that the priest in the
church has his book before him he kneled / he stareth / he looks on his
book / he holds up his hondes. And for great devotion in case he wepeth /
and makes devout prayers. To whom weneste thou that the priest does all
this worship. Dives. to god and not to the book. Pauper. On the same manner
should the lewd man use his book / that is ymagery and paynture / not to
worship the image / but god in heaven and saints in their degree. And that
all the worship that he does before the image / he does not to the image / but
to him that the image represents. Dives. This example is good / but know
thou any better. Pauper. When the priest says his mass at the aultre /
commonly there is an image before him / and como^ly it is a crucyfixe / stone or
tree / or portrayed. Dives. Why more a crucyfixe than an other image. Pauper.
For every mass singing is a special mind making of Crystus passion / and
therefore he has before him a crucyfixe to do him to have the more fresshe
remembrance as he ought to have of crystus passion. Dives. The reason is good
/ say foeth. Pauper. Before this image ye priest says his mass / and makes
the highest prayers y^ holy church can deuyse for salvation of the quycke and
of the deed. He holds up his hondes / he boweth / or else he kneled down /
and all the worship yt he can do he does. Ouermore he offered up ye highest
sacrefyce and the best offrynge that any heart can deuyse / that is Christ
gods sone of heaven / under form of bread and wine. All this worship does
the priest at the mass before the image / And yet I hope that there is no man
ne woman so leude / that he would say that ye priest syngeth his mass ne
makes his prayer ne does that worship / ne offreth up gods sone Christ him
self to the image. Dives. God forbede that any man or woman should say so or
believe / that were error most of all errors. Pauper. On the same manner
should the lewd man do his worship before the image / and make his prayer
before the image and not to the image.

Dives. Contra. On good frydaye over all in holy church / men crepe to the
cross and worship ye cross. Pauper. That is sothe but not as thou menest. The
cross ye we crepe to and worship so hyghely yt time is christ himself yt
deyed on ye cross that day for our sin and our sake. As says Beda
libro.iij. de ge^ma anime. For the shap of a man is a cross. And as he henge
upon the rode he was a very cross. He is that cross as all doctoures say /
to whom we pray and say. O crux aue spes vnica. Hayle be thou cross our only
hope / increase thou to the mekely her rightwysnesse this passion time / and
give pardon to them that been gylty. He is that cross bryghter than all the
sterres of the world as holy church syngeth and says. O crux splendidior
cunctis astris mundi and^. And as Beda says for asmoche as christ was most
despised of mankind on good frydaye / therefore holy church has ordained that
on the good frydaye men should do him most worship of all. And for this
cause we do that great high worship that day / not to the cross that the
priest holds in his hand / but to him that deyed for us all that day upon
the cross. For oftentyme that cross that the priest holds in his hand is
fulle vnreuerenced and vnthende. Christ himself / crystus passion / crystus
death / crystus living in earth fulle of pain and woe / the cross that he deyed
on and every likeness of the cross is called Crystus cross. But the
likeness of a thing ought not to be in as much reverence and worship as
the thing himself. And every lord and knight has a specyale token in his
arms or else besides his arms whereby he is known / and often bears the name
of his token / and by the name of his token his deeds ben told of heraudes and
gestours that know not their name neither their person. Right so Christ in
holy write oftymes is called a cross / for the cross is his special token.
And so sometime we speak to the cross as to Christ himself. Sometime we speak
of the cross only that he henge upon. And so we speak often in holy church
service to the cross as to Christ himself / and anon we turn the word
oonly to ye cross / that he dyed on. And so sometime we speak to the cross and
of the cross / as to him and of him yt the cross betokens. Sometime we speak
of the cross only as of his token / and the cross yt he dyed upon / and so
one word is referred to diverse things / and this blyndeth much people in
their redyng. For they mean yt al ye prayers yt holy church makes to ye
cross that he makes them to the tree that Christ dyed on / or else to ye
cross in the church / as in yt anteme. O crux splendidior. And so for
lewdness they ben deceived / and worshypp creatures as god himself. Dives. On
palm sunday at processyon the pressed draws up the veyle before the rode /
and falls down to the ground with all the people and says thryes. Aue rex
noster. Hayle be thou our king / and so he worshypeth that image as king.
Pauper. Absit. God forbede. He speaks not to the image that the carpenter has
made and the peyntour peynted but if the priest be a fool / for that stock or
stone was never king / but he speaks to him that deyed on the cross for us
all to him that is king of all thing.

Caplm.v.
Dives. I assente / for this is against nature reason and kind / that man
which is nere of kynne to god that is very man and our brother / should
worship in that manner either stock or stoone. For they may neither here ne see
/ ne help themself And therefore who so worshyppeth images in this manner /
does great dishonor to man that is so noble in order of kind / and much
more to god that took mankind and became man / and in our manhood is above all
mankind. Pauper. If the kings sone kneled to his churl or to his page and
worshypped him as his sovereign and prayed hy^ of grace / that oonly the king
might grant and did him the same worship that he should do his fader the
king it were a great dishonor both to the sone and to the fader. And
therefore it is repreef to gentylles to be over homely with boys against good
norture. But much more dishonor do we to god and to our self also / sythen we
be ye kings childern of heaven / so nyghe of kynne and heirs of the kingdom of
heaven / if we worship stocks or stones or any other images / or done them any
service / as says the law. De consec di iij. Venerabiles. Dives. This is open
enough that thou say. For the image neither can ne may help at need For it
has no virtue at all. It is no thing else but a book or a token to the
lewd people as thou saydeste first to styre hem to think on god and on
saints in heaven / and so to worship god over all thing and saints in their
degree. Pauper. For this reason ben crosses made by ye way / that when folk
passing see the cross / they should think on hy^ that deyed on the cross /
and worshypp him above all thing. And for the same reason is the cross born
before in processyon that all that follow and mete with the cross should
worship him that deyed on the cross / and thank him for his endeles charity.
Also the cross is borne before / in token that in all our living and all our
deeds we should have eye and heart to him that deyed on ye cross as to our
king / our head / our lord / and our leder to y^ bliss of heaven. And therefore
Solomon says Oculi sapientis in capite eius. The eyes of the wise man ben
always in his head / that is Ihesu christ / which is head of holy church and
of all christian people.

Caplm.vi.
Dives. Sythen ymagery is but a token and a book of the lewd people / teache
me yet a little better to know this book and to read therein. Pauper. Ymagery
some what betokens in special / somewhat in common and general. In special
token the image of our lady is painted with a child in the left arm in token
that she is mother of god and with a lylye or else with a rose in her right
hand / in token that she is maiden withouten end / and flower of all wymen.
And so of other saints / whose images have diverse signs in their hondes and
other places for diverse virtues and martyrdoms that tho saints suffredde^ and
had in their life The image of saint Peter is painted with keys in his hand
in token that Christ betoke Saint Peter the keys of holy church / and of the
kingdom of heaven. But yet afterward Christ gaaf tho keys to all the apostles
/ as ye gospelles witness Mathei xviij. et Iohe^s.xx.c. Saint Poule is painted
with a sword in his hand in token that he was heded with a sword for Crystus
sake / and also in token ye sometime he pursued holy church with ye sword.
Saint Johan the euangelyste is painted with a coupe in his hand and an adder
therein in token that he drank dedely venym / and thorugh the virtue of the
cross it lost his malice and did him none harm. and in his other hand he
bears a palm in token that he was a martyr / and had the palm of martyrdom /
all though he was not slain / for yet his will was for to deye for gods
sake Saint Johan baptyst is painted in a Cameles skin at the payntours will
in token that his clothyng was full hard and sharp made of Cameles here. He
bears a lombe with a cross in his left hand / and his finger of the right
hand there toward in token that he showed gods lombe gods sone y^ deyed
for us on the cross wha^ he said to the people. Ecce agnus deiecce qui tollit
peccata mu^di. See gods lombe / see him that does away the sins of the
world. Saint Katheryne is painted with a whele in the one hand / in token of
the horrible wheles which the tyrau^t. Maxen cius ordained to rent her from
lyth to lyth / but the angel destroyed them and many thousands of hethen
people / and so they did her none harm She has a sword in the other hand /
in token that her head was smyten of with a sword for Crystus sake. Saint
Margarete is painted also with a dragon under her feet / and with a cross in
her hand / in token that when the dragon devoured her / she blessed her / and
by the virtue of the cross the dragon braste / and she camout of him in good
health and hole. And so forth of diverse images of other saints / which
images be made to represente to man the virtuous living of saints / and the
holy ending of their temporal life.

Caplm.vij.
Dives. What betokens ymagerye in general or common. Pauper. Commonly all the
apostles ben painted bare foot in token of Innocencye and of penance.
Nevertheless they went not always fully bare foot / but sometime with galoches /
a sole byneth and a fastnynge above the foot / of which galoches saint Beda
says in his Orygynall. The angel spoke to saint Peter saying. Calciate
caligas tuas. Do on thy galoches or sandalynes as says saint Mark in his
gospel. Also the apostles commonly and other saints ben painted with manteles
in token of the virtue and pouerte which they had. For as says saint
Gregorye. All these worldely goods ben naught else but a clothing to the
body. And a man tele is a louse clothing not fast to the body but louse /
and lightly may be done away. Right so the goods of this world was but a
mantell to ye apostles and other saints. For they were always so louse from
their heart yt they gaaf no great tale thereof / nor to lose them. They were
not fast ne clyued not to them by no false couetyse / but always they were
redye to forsake all for Crystus sake. Dives. What betokens the round
things painted on their hedes. Pauper. The bliss that they have withouten
end. Of which ye prophet Ysaye speaks. Leticia sempiter na super capita
eorum Ysaye.li. Dives. They were not so gay in clothing as they ben painted.
Pauper. That is soth. For many of them were clothed in full hard clothyng and
poor as saint Poule says. Circuierunt in melotis in pellibus caprinis
angustiati. They went about in broken skynnes / in shynnes of got nedy
anguysshed. Nevertheless images standing in chirches may be considered in two
manners / either as they represente the astate of saints of whom they be images
as they lived in this life / and so they be to be painted in such manner
clothing as tho saints used whiles they lived here. Or else they may be
considered as they represente the astate of endelesse bliss in which saints
be now / and so they be to be painted ryaly and solempnely / as the cherubyns
yt represented the angellys yt ben in heaven were made of gold. Exodi.xxv.
Nathelesse in all such paynture an honest mean neither to costly because of
this consyderaco^n / ne to vile because of ye fourmer consyderacyon me thinks
is to be kept.

Caplm.viij.
Dives. why ben angellys pay^ted in lykenes of young men sithe they be spyrytes
and have no bodies. Pauper. There may no payntour paynte a spyryt in his kind.
And therefore to the better representaco^n they be painted in the lykenes of a
man / which in soul is most according to angellys kind. And though the
angel is not such bodily as he is painted / he is nevertheless such ghoostly
/ and has such doing and being spyrytuell. They be painted like young men
berdlesse / in token yt they ben endless and elden not / ne feeble not / but
always in one lykyng / in one astate / always mighty and strong And also they
be pay^ted with crulled here / in token yt their thought and there love is set
always in right order / and turn always up again to god / than king him and
worshyppynge him in all thing. For by the here of the head in holy write is
understand thought and affecco^ns of the heart. Also they ben painted with
stoles about their necks / in token that they be always ready to serve god and
man at gods byddyng. And therefore they ben called Administratorij spu^s. Ad
Hebre.i.c. That is to say / spyrytes of service. For they serve to god / in
rulynge of mankind and governance of this world. They ben pay^ted fethered
and with wings / in token of lyghtnesse and delyuerenesse in her works. For
in a twynclynge of an eye they may be in heaven and in earth / here and at Rome
/ and at Ihrusale^. They ben painted with wheles vnth their fete in token yt
they meue and rule ye round bodies / the wheles and the cercles in heaven / and
ye course of the planetes as ye phylosophre says / and also in token yt as the
whele tourneth always about the center and his mids / so the angellys doing
is always about god / and always ben nygh hy^ where ever they be. Also sometime
they be painted armed with spear sword and shield / in token yt they be ready to
defend us fro ye fendes that been besy night and day to lose us. For but if
holy angellys helped us and defend us and kept us lettyng ye fendes malice /
we might not withsto^de ne be saved. And therefore right as every man and woman
has a wicked angel assygned to hy^ by ye fend to te^pte hy^. So has he a
good angel assygned to hy^ of god / to save him if he will follow his rule.

Caplm.ix.
Dives. Why ben the four eua^gelystes painted in such diverse lykenes sythen
they were men all four. Pauper. For diverse manner of writing and techynge.
Mathewe is painted in likeness of a man. For he pryncypally wrote and taught
the manhood of Christ and told how he bycame man. And most specially and
most openly wrote his genologye. Saint Johan that wrote. In principio erat
verbu^. Is painted in likeness of an egle / which of all fowls flees
highest / and in sight is sharpest and may see ferthest. So saint Johan spoke
and wrote highest of the godhede / and had more Insyght and understanding in
the godhede than the other Euangelystes. Saint Luke is painted in the likeness
of a calfe or an ox / because that he speaks most openly of the passion of
Christ that was offered up to the fader of heaven on the Aultre of the cross on
good frydaye / as the ox or the calfe was offered on the Aul^e in the Temple by
the law for salvation of the people / which offrynge was betokenyng of
Crystus passion And for yt saint Luke speaks most openly of Crystus passion /
which was betokened by the sacrefyce of the ox. Therefore he is painted and
presented by the likeness of an ox. Saint Mark is painted in likeness of a
lion / because yt he speaks most openly of Crystus resurrecco^n / how he rose
from death to life. For when ye lioness has whelped they leye.iij. days
and.iij. nyghtes deed / tylle on ye third day / the lion their fader comes
and makes an hydeous cry over them and anon with yt voys and cry they
quycken and waken / and in yt manner rise from death to life / and for this
reason is saint Mark presented by the likeness of a lion / for he spoke more
openly of Crystus resurrecco^n. And therefore his gospel is read on esterdaye.
Also you shall understand that Christ was god and man / and priest and king.
Mathewe spoke most openly of his ma^hode / and began at his manhood / and
therefore he is painted in the likeness of a man. Saint John^ spoke most of
his god hode / and began at his godhode. And therefore he is painted in the
lykenes of an egle as I said first. Saint Luke spoke most of his preesthode /
and therefore he is painted in the lykenes of an ox or of a calfe. For that was
the pryncypall sacrefyce that the prestes by the old law offered in to^ the
Temple. Saint Mark spoke most of his kingdom / showing him king of all thing.
And therefore he is paynte^ in the likeness of a lion / that is king of
unreasonable bestes Dives Why ben they so painted in the four ends of the
cross Pauper. In token that he that deyed on the cross is king of all thing.
For the Egle is king of all fowls. The Lion is king of all wild bestes
unreasonable. The ox is king of all tame bestes helping to mankind. Man is
king of all bestes and of all vysyble creatures that were made for him. But
Christ is king of all thing vysyble and Inuysyble. And in token thereof / the
four Euangelystes ben painted about him on the cross in diverse likeness of
four diverse kings / in kind as four kings herawdes blasynge his arms / and
the great battle and vyctory that he did against the fend for mankind upon
the cross. Dives. why ben they painted in houses in four parties of the
house. Pauper. For the same cause and for deuoco^n and for knowlechynge of his
high lordshypp that all we have of him / and against tempests and wicked
spyrytes that free the eua^gelystes ben set in manner of a cross / and ben
ashamed and abashed of the cross / and specially of Crystus passion / by the
which they were all dysconfyted.

Dives. Why ben images covered in Lenten from man's sight. Pauper. In token
that while men ben in dedely sin / they may not see gods face ne saints in
heaven. And in tokenyng yt god and all the court of heaven hyde their face from
man and woman whiles they be in dedely sin / till the time that they will
amend them by sorrow of heart and shryfte and satysfacco^n. Dives. why ben
they more hyd in lenten than in other time. Pauper. The time of lent
betokens the time of Adams sin / for the which we lost the sight of gods
face / and god and the court of heaven hyd their faces from mankind unto the
time of Crystus passion. And in token thereof dn^ica in septuagesima when holy
church begins to make mind of Adams sin / he leueth songs of myrthe /
as Glia in excelsis. Te deu^. and Alla. For thorugh the sin of Adam our Joy
was turned in to sorrow and woe. Dives. I hold it well done to hyde images in
lenten to let men from ydolatrye. Nathelesse images of common offrynge ben
seldom hyd in lenten for lettyng^e of lucre. Pauper. Saint Poule says that
couetyse and namely of prestes is cause of much ydolatry. Auaricia est
ydolorum seruitus. Coloc. iij. For were not couetyse tho images should be set
as little by as other and as soon covered and hyde. Dives. I suppose that
saints in earth were not arrayed so gaye with shone of silver and with clothes
of broodery rings and broches and other Iewellys as images be now. And sometime
you saydest that by the fete is vnderstonden man's love and his affection. And
therefore me thinks yt the fete so shode in silver showed that the love and the
affecco^n of prestes is much set in gold and silver and erthely couetyse.
For such richesses of clothing of the images is but a tollynge of more
offrynge / and a token to the lewd people where they should offer and what /
for they had lever a broche or a ring of silver or of gold / than a penny or a
half penny / though the broche or the ring be but of easy price. And commonly
they shoe none images ne clothe them so richely / but if they erne first their
shone and their clothes / but if it be to toll folk to offrynge. Pauper. Leave
this matter for it is odyouse to y^ coueytouse prestes that win great richesse
by such images. And therefore let such words pass at this time and speak we
some thing else more to purpose.

Caplm.xi.
Dives. Christ says in the gospel. Dominu^ deum tuum adorabis. et ei solt
seruies. Mathey.iiij. Thou shalt worship thy lord god / and serve him
allone / And it is of the first co^mau^demente as holy write shows well Deuteronomy
sexto. How might I keep this that I should no thing worshypp ne serve but
god. I must also worship my king / my prelate / my soueraynes and serve
them as mine astate axeth and do to them my deutees / homage / and ^ewtee. And
saint Poule says. Per caritate^ seruite inuicem. Ad Gala.v. Serve ye togydre
each man to other by charity. And Saint Peter says. Serui subditi. estote
dn^is vestris. non tantum bonis et modestis. sed eciam discolis. Ye servants
be ye subgett to your lords / not only to the good and to the meke / but also
to the tyrauntes. And in the same place he byddeth us worship all men. He
byddeth us also dread our god and worship our king. Pauper. As clerks say /
there is two manner of service and of worship. One that longs oonly to god and
to no creature / and is called Latria in latin / that is to saxe dyuyne
service and dyuyne worship / for it longs oonly to god. An other is a
service and a worship common to god and to creatures reasonable and
understanding / that is to say to man woman and angel / and is called Dulia
in latin. The first service and worship that is called Latria. dyuyne service
longs oonly to god And in this manner service speaks Christ when he says
tho words. Dominu^ deum tuum and^. Thou shall worship thy lord god and
serve him allone with dyuyne service and dyuyne worship. That is to say /
thou shall do no Latriam / no dyuyne worshypp / ne dyuyne service to no
creature / but only to god. And therefore who so does any dyuyne service that
is called Latria. to any creature to any image or to any form or figure / he
does ydolatrye. For Ydolum in latin is called a form and an image in
English. And therefore who so does dyuyne worshypp that is called Latria / to
any image he does ydolatrye. Dives. What call thou proprely Latriam / dyuyne
worship and service that longs oonly to god. Pauper. As says a great
clerk Antisidorenlis in su^ma sua libro.iij. Latria is a protestacyon and
knowlechyng of the high mayeste of god that he is sovereign goodness sovereign
wysedom / sovereign might / sovereign troth / sovereign largeness / shaper
and sauer of all creatures / and end of every thing / and all that we have we
have of him / and without him we have right naught / and naught may have ne do
without him / nor we ne none other creature. This knowlechynge and protestacyon
is done in three manners / by heart / by speech / and by deed. By heart that we
love him as sovereign goodness / and love him as sovereign wysdom and
sovereign truth yt may not disceyue ne be disceyued and hope and trust in
him as in sovereign might that may best help at n^de and as sovereign
largeness and lord that may best yield us our mede / and as souorayne
savior most merciful and most redye to forgive us our mysdede / by mouth
and speech this knowlechyng and this service is done / wha^ we swear by his
name worshypfully and truly in thing of charge and fle ydell oaths / foul
oaths / false oaths / and in our speech do worship to his holy name / and swear
not by creatures / but only by his holy name. For he says in y^ gospel.
Reddes domino iuramenta tua Thou shall yield thyn oaths to thy lord god and to
no creature. Also it is done by vows making / for it is not lawful to make
auowe to any creature. And therefore he says. Reddes dn^o vota tua. Thou shall
also yield thyn auowes to thy lord god / and to no creature. And the prophet
says. Vouete et reddite domino deo vestro. Make ye vows / and yield ye your
vows to your lord god / and not to the images stocks ne stones Also it is
done with prayer and praysyng of the mouth. For we must pray him and praise
him as sovereign might sovereign wisdom / sovereign goodness / sovereign
troth / as all rightful and merciful / as shaper and sauer of all thing /
and lord of all and sovereign help in every need. And in this manner may we
not pray ne praise any creature. And therefore they yt make their prayers and
their prasynges before the images / and say their Pater noster / and their Aue
maria / and other prayers and praysynges / used commonly of holy church / or
any such other / if they do it to the image / and speak to the image they do
open ydolatrye. And they be not excused all if they understand not what they
say. For their sight and their other wits and their Inner wit also /
shows well there ought no such prayers praysynges ne worship for to be done
to none such images. For they may not here them / ne see them ne help them at
a need.

Caplm.xij.
ALso this protestaco^n and knowlechynge is done by deed / as by offrynge / and
sacrefyce making which longs oonly to god. For what man offreth or makes
sacrefyce / he knowlecheth him gyuer of grace / and maker of holiness /
savior and forgyuer of sin / and this may no creature do. Also it is shows
by tokens of the body / as by knelynge / bowyng / lyftyng up of hondes / by
bu^chyng of the breast / the which tokens may be done both to god and to
reasonable creatures / but otherwise to god than to reasonable creatures. For as
says a clerk Ricardus de media villa super terciu^ sentenciarum did.ix.
q^one vltima. When we knele to god / in y^ we knowledge that we may not stand
in virtue / in goodness / ne in well but oonly by him. When we fall al down
to the ground to god / we knowledge that but he held us and kept us we should
fall all to naught / and when we hold up our hands to him / we knowleche
that we may right naught do without him / and that we be all in his power /
and that he may do without us what he will / and so we put us only in his
grace. Also by that we knowleche that all that we have of any goodness / we
take it of his hand and of his gift. When we bunche our breasts / we
knowleche us gylty against him in heart and in deed. And that we have done much
sin which oonly god knows. For oonly he knows man's heart and man's
will. Also we bunche our self on the breast in token of sorrow of heart for
our misdeeds / and that we repent us sore of our misdeeds. These tokens of
reverence be done also to reasonable creatures / as to the angel / man and
woman / but not in this manner. For when we knele or bow us / or fall down to
the ground / or hold up our hondes to any creature / we knowleche that there
is some soueraynte and some virtue in him that we knele to / whereby he may
help us / not as pryncypall helper / but as secondarye with the help of god.
And therefore these deeds of worship and reverence should not be done to images
/ stocks / or stones / ne to none such other. For they have none such virtue
ne soueraynte above man ne woman another right naught may help them at their
need / neither them self also So that these deeds of reverence pryncypally
ought to be done to god / seco^darye to angel man or woman / but in no wise
to none other unreasonable creatures / ne to none such images. And as says a
great clerk doctor Halis in su^ma sua. To god men should knele with both the
knees / in token that in him is all our pryncypale help / but to man oonly
with the one knee. So my friend ye shall understand that the worshypp which
is called Latria. shall be done oonly to god. The worshypp that is called
Dulia. is common both to god and man For we should worship man woman and angel
/ not for them self / but pryncypally for god / for that they ben made to
gods image / for they ben gods servants and gods mynystres. For there is
no lord / ne tyrant / ne prelate / man nor woman so wicked / but that he
served god in some thing. And also though he be now wicked / we wot not how
soon that he shall amend him and be onr brother in to the bliss of heaven. As
Saint Austyn says upon the saultre. But to the fend should we do no
worship / for he is dampened without an end / and there is no hope of his
salvation.

Caplm.xiij.
WE should worship man and woman / for he is made to the likeness of god / for
his office / for the worship of god / and despise his sin. And therefore
Saint Peter says. Omnes honorate. Worship ye all men and wymen. Honor
inuicem preuenientes. Be ye besy / who so may every man worship other.
Dives. Me meruaylleth much why men be so besy to do the people worship or
images. Pauper. Couetyse of men of holy church and lewdenesse both of them
and of the people ben cause of such ydolatrye. Dives. I have herd say that
many great clerks holden therewith / and say that men should worship images.
Pauper. Worshypp is a large word and common to dyuyne worshypp and service that
is called Latria. and to worship that is called Dulia. which longs
proprely to speak only to reasonable creatures. For as says the phylosophre
quarto Ethicorum. Worship is mede of virtue / and it ought not for to be done
to any creature / but that the creature have some goodness of virtue moral /
and of grace / or else some office to lead and to bring folk to moral
virtue. Dives. Than to the image stock or stone / gold or silver / longs
none such worship. For when that it is so sere and so dry and worm eten /
it has no virtue at all / but for to brenne sooner in the fire than a grene
tree. But when that it wext upon the earth / it had bertue to wexe and spring
and to bring forth grene leaves and flowers to conforte of man's eye and fruit
to help of man and be. And yet will no man worshypp such grene trees ne
precious stones ne herbys all if they have great virtues and wonderful / for
they have no virtue moral. Much more men should not worship se^e dry and
worm eten trees / that have no virtue at all. Say forth what thou wylt.
Pauper. Also worshypp is called veneraco^n that stands in honest and syker
keeping / honest handelynge / clean dyghtyng / in standing / in sitting / in
place setting. And this manner of worshypp may be done and ought to be done to
every holy thing that longs to god and to holy church / as book chalyce
vestyment belles and images / in as much as the be ournaments of holy church
/ and the lewd men's book But this worship and veneracyon is no service ne
subgeccyon of him yt does it to thing yt he does it to / but it shows
subgeccyon and service of the things so worshypped to him that puts it so
in worship / so keeps it and so saved it. And in this manner the law called
images venerable and worshypfull / for there should no man despise them ne
defoule them / brenne them ne break them. De consecraco^e. dis. iij.
Venerabiles. And for this manner of veneraco^n and worship says the law in the
same place / and some doctors / that images book or vestymente and chalyce
may be worshypped with Dulia. But they take that Dulia full largely / and full
vnproprely. For such worship and veneracyon is no service ne subgeccyon as I
said before. And proprely to speak Dulia is a worship that longs only to god
and to reasonable creatures. And pryncypally and excellently to our lady saint
Mary / and to the manhood of Christ / which worship is called Yperdulia.
proprely said. Also to the cross that Christ deyed upon / if that men had it
as clerks say longs Yperdulia. For all things that lacked life / the
cross of Christ ought most to be worshyped / and be in most veneraco^n and
reverence. But that veneracyon is called yperdulia. vnproprely. Also friends
there is worship that the subgette does to his sovereign / know lechyng him his
sovereign by word or by token / as by knelyng bowynge and such other / and
this manner worship is called proprely adoracyon. Other worship yt is called
honoraco^n / and veneraco^n is co^uenyent both to the sovereign and to the
subgette. For a lord honors his servant by gifts / by promoco^ns in
office and dygnyte. Also a lord worshypeth a poor man wha^ he sets hy^ at
his own table / or above other that been of higher degree than he / and yet he
adoureth him not / ne does him ye worship of adoraco^n Nathelesse adoraco^n is
taken sometime full vnproprely for common honoraco^n and veneraco^n. And for as
much as all these manners of worship so diverse ben called with one name of
worship in English tongue / and often y^ latin of worship is taken and used
vnproprely and to commonly / therefore men fall in much doubt and error in
redyng and not well understand what they read.

Caplm.xiiij.
Dives. This dystyncco^n and declaraco^n of worshypyng how it is taken and used
in diverse manner / and how it is called with one name in English / has avoided
many arguments and reasons which I thought to have made against the. I am out
of doubt. I can answer there to my self by thy declaracyon. But two things
as me thinks you saydest not all troth. Pauper. Which be tho. Dives. Thou
saydest that men should not offer but only to god ne knele on both knees but
oonly to god. And we see at our eye that men offer to the priest in the
church and knele on both knees to the priest in shryfte. Pauper. Men offer not
the pressed but oonly to god as I said first by the hondes of the priest / for
the priest is gods mynystre ordained to resceyue things that been offered to
god as tithes and deuocyons and live thereby honestly and to spend the
remenau^t to nedy folk and to worship of god and the help of holy church. Ne
men knele not in that manner to the priest / but to god before the priest for
the reverence of god and of the sacraments of holy church. But when man
kneled to temporal lords prelates or prestes or any other person / for
reverence of his person or of his dygnyte / he should knele oonly with that
one knee. But as says Saint Austyn de ciuitate dei libro decimo capitulo
quinto. By flaterye and ouerlowenesse of the people and ambycyon of the
soueraynes many worshyppes that longs sometime to god allone / ben now used in
the worshyppynge of sinful man and woman. And though it be also do to man or
to woman for the worship of god as I said first / it is suffrable and
suffycyent.

Caplm.xv.
Dives. Thuryfycacyon and encensyng was by old time an high dyuyne worshypp
also And many saints were put to the death because they would not encense
images stocks ne stones. But now clerks encense images and other / prcestes
and clerks and lewd people olso. And so as me thinks they do ydolatrye.
Pauper. In every law thuryfycaco^n or encensynge has been an high dyuyne
worship that ought not to be done to any creature by way of offrynge.
Nevertheless it may be done in two manners. First by way of offrynge with
conuenyent betokenynge / and so it may be done to any creature. For in this
manner it owes not to be done but oonly of a priest and at an aultre hallowed or
with a superaltare hallowed / so that prestes lefully may say there their
mass. For by the encensour is understand man's heart by the encense holy
prayers / by the fire charity. And so such encensyng and thuryfycacyon
betokens that right as the priest offreth up in the encensour encense / sweet
smelling by hete of the fire. So the priest and the people by the priest
offren up her hertes to god and her prayers quyckned by the fire of charity.
And pray that their bedes and their prayers and deuocyons may be pleasant to
him for that endelesse charity that he showed to mankind / when he deyed for
us all upon the cross / which charity is presented in the sacrament of the
aultre For all the mass singing is a special mind making of Crystus
passion. And right as Christ was mean in his passion between god and mankind.
So is the priest in his mass saying / and sacrefyce making and offrynge and
encensynge mean between god and the people. And therefore oonly a preeste
should encense at the aultre and with hallowed encense / and with holy prayer
saying in this wise for him self and for the people. Dirigatur oracio
measicut incensum in conspectu tuo. Lord make my prayers goo right up in thy
sight as encense. Also thuryfycacyon or encense may be done only for sterynge
of devotion and for tokenynge. And so it may be done to the clergy and to the
people / in token that as the encense by hete of the fire smells sweet / and
also styeth up to heuenwarde. So should they lift up their hertes with
deuoco^n / and make their prayers in charity that they might be pleasant to
god. For but if the preeste and the people ben in charity / otherwise their
prayers pleases not god / neither gooth not up to god as it should else do /
and therefore is no man worthy for to be encensed but if he be in charity. And
when the clergy in the quere or the people is encensed / they should bow them
low for the reverence of god / and take it not as for worship done to hy^ but
as sterynge to deuoco^n / and as a token what deuoco^n they should she we to
god / and by bowynge them show lowenesse of deuoco^n yt it stereth them to.
For without deuoco^n and lowness of heart our prayers gone not up to god. But
as says the wise man. The prayer of hy^ that loweth hy^ in his prayer thyrleth
the clouds. The myssalle and the gospel is encensed in token that the prayers
written therein prouffyte little or naught / but if they be made with devotion
and in charity And there should no man preche the gospel / but with devotion
and for charity / and all his speed and all his prouffyte refer up to god /
and all his prayers put in his will. At buryeng of people men encense the
deed bodies / in token yt he deyed in charity / and in his deyeng he had his
heart up to god / by hope faith charity and deuoco^n / for else he is not
worthy to be buried in christian buryelles. Also in token that he shall quycken
again and rise up from death to life at day of dome and go up to heaven for his
charity which he had by his life as the encense styed up by the hete of the
fire / And for the same cause is the grave encensed / in token that he shall
awake and rise from death to life. Also the body and the grave ben encensed /
in token yt it is pleasant to god yt holy church prayed for him. But this
manner of encensynge done to the clergy to the people to the deed bodies and to
the grave should be done with encense not hallowed ne blyssed / for it is none
offrynge. And as touching encensynge / done in the presence of images / as it
seems to me it is not done proprely to the images / but before the images in
diverse sygnyfycacyons or tokenynges. For when encensyng is done before a
painted image yt represents Christ which is very god and man. It seems to
me y^ the encensynge sygnefyed yt all deuoco^n and charytable prayer which is
bitokened by encense / should pryncypally stye up to god / and when encensyng
is done before any image of our lady or of other saints / it may sygnefye yt
the prayers of saints which pray for us wretches in earth stye up by their
great charity unto the mayeste of god. Dives. Sith encensyng is not done to the
people by way of worshyppyng / why encense they first the soueraynes more
thanne the subgettes. Pauper. For in all thing must be kept order in doing.
And also in token that as they ben pryncypal in state and dygnyte / so should
they be pryncypall in devotion and charity / and give other good ensample.

Caplm.xvi.
Dives. Why worship we god and pray to him more in the eest than in to the
weste / southe / and north. Pauper. Eest and Weste Southe and North / and
over all it is lewfull and medefull to worship god as him yt is over all lord
of all thing. But for to draw christian people to one manner doing / and to flee
dyfformyte. Therefore holy church has ordained yt men should in church and
other places if it may be welldone / worship god pray him and praise him in
the Eest / as the law shows well. Distinct xi. ecclesiasticarum. And that
for diverse causes. First for Christ deyed upon the cross in to the weste /
and therefore in our prayer we should turn us in to the eest to see how Christ
for us henge upon y^ tree / and for to have an eye to his passion / and worship
him that deyed for us all upon the tree. Also to let the people to sue the
Jews in manner of worshyppyng For at gods ordenau^ce they worshyped
westwarde in token that their law and their manner worshyppynge in their
cerymonyes should soon pass and go down and make an end as the day ends
and passes away in to the weste. And also in token that for any worshypp or
praysynge or for prayer that they did / yet they should go down to hell /
till the new law came when Christ deyed for us all. And for the same reason
Christ deyed westwarde / and in his deyeng said. Consu^matum est. That is to
say. It is ended. For in his death the old testamente ended and went down as
the son / and the day gooth down in the weste. And therefore we christian
people worship in to the eest / by techyng of the holy ghoost / in token that
our law shall spring and sprede as the day coming as the son ryseth and
spryngeth out of the cest / and as all the sterres ben most bryghtest in the
eest / and when they go in to the weste all they begin to wax dymme and
derke / so was the old law full dym me and full derke. But the new law is
open bright and clear. Also we worship Christ most in the eest / for he was
most despised in the Eest / when he on a good frydaye henge on the cross
turned in to y^ weste / when the Jews stood before him and passed before him
with many scorns and despytouse words / with mowes / and many a Iape they
said. Vach q^ destruis templum dei. Tprut for the that destroyed gods Temple.
And for he was most despised in the eest of the Jews and hethen people.
Therefore christian people worship him most again in to the eest. And for he
was most despised for us on y^ good frydaye / therefore we worship hy^ most on
the good frydaye. And in this manner as much as we may / we turn all his
despyte in to worship of him Also we worship god in y^ eest in toke^ yt righ as
the son ryseth up in y^ eest so we believe that Christ rose up from death to
life / and in that we worship him as him that rose from death to life / and
shall live without end. Also in token that we long to come again to the bliss
of paradyse yt we lost in the eest / and pray god yt we may with his mercy
come again thereto Dives These reasons ben good. But why were than the.xxv. men
blamed of god / for they worshyped eestwarde at the rysyng of the son / as we
find Ezechiel.viij. Pauper. Not for yt they worshypped god eestwarde. For
Danyell and many other worshypped god eestwarde / west / south / and north / as
he is worthy for to be worshyped over all. A solis ortu vsque ad occasum
laudabile nome^ dn^i. From the son up rysyng unto ye going down gods name
is praysable and worshyfull. But they were blamed for they worshypped the son
in his rysyng / and did dyuyne worship thereto in despyte of gods Temple
and of gods law as many fools yet do now a days worshyppynge the son in
his rysynge / and y^ new moan in his first showing Dives. They worship him yt
made the son and the moon. Pauper. If they do so they do well / but I dread
they do not all so. And as says a great clerk Leo the pope in a sermon for
asmoche as it has a likeness of ydolatrye and custom of hethen people men
should absteyne them therfro. For the people is full much enclyned to folly
and to ydolatrye.

Caplm.xvij.
Dives. That is soth. For these days men do worship to the son / moan / and
sterres / y^ for to worship the sterres and the planetes / and the craft of
astronomye / they will put out god of his maysterye / out of his kingdom and
his lordshyp / and out of his fredom / and make him more bound to sterres /
than ever was any king or any lord / or any man upon earth. They will be of
gods pryue counsel will god or not / and rule his domes / his deeds / his
works and all by their wits and by the course of the planetes / in somoche
yt as they say there shall no man ne woman be hole ne seek / foul ne fair /
rich ne poor / wise ne fool / good ne wicked / but by the werkyng of the
bodies above and by their wits so that they can tell it before. There shall
fall no myschyef ne welthe neither to person ne to comunyte / but by her
wits and by y^ course of planetes. None hungre morayne ne tempeste / no
sickness / ^oo war shall fall but by their wits and by the werkynge of
the bodies above. For as they say / the bodies above rule all thing here
bynethe. And thus they will make god more thralle and of less power than any
king or lord upon earth. For why our lyege lord the king god save his life has
power and fredom of a page for to make a yoman / of a yoman a gentylman / of a
gentylman a knight / of a poor man a great lord without leave or help of the
planetes. And if a man trespass against him and be taken with treasone / he is
of power to do him to be hanged and drawn / and to take from him and his
heirs the heritage and make him full poor. And he is of power to make his
true lyegeman rich though he be right poor. This fredom and this powir has
our lyege lord our king / where so the planetes ben / or in what sign / in
what respect / or in what constellaco^n or coniunccyon / our king may do all
this and axe the planetes no leave / they may not let him / ne all the
astronomers with all their calculaco^n though they watch and stare after the
sterres / tylle they lose their hedes may not let hy^ / ne save oo man's life
that the king will have deed. Much more than the king of heaven yt made son
and moan and sterres and all thing of naught and rules gydeth and weldeth al
thing at his will may make rich and poor / fair and foul / hole and seek /
wise and fool / good or wicked whom he lyketh without any help of the
planetes. And if any person or comunyte trespass against him / he may chastyse
him by hungre by moreyne / by sickness / by tempest / by sword / by pouerte /
by loss of catel and what wise he will / and he may reward his true
servants as hy^ lykith both in this world and in y^ other world axinge the
planetes no leave, ne counsel of astronomers.

Caplm.xviij.
PAuper. As we find in holy write. Gen^. i.c. At the begy^nyng of ye world
when god made all thing of naught / the fourth day he made son and moan and
sterres and set them in ye fyrmament to give light to the creatures here
byneth / yt the son pryncypally should shine and give light by day / moan
and sterres by night More over as says ye book he made them and ordained them
for to part the day from ye night / and they should be in tokenes and times
days and years / yt by the tokens of y^ bodies above men should know y^ day
from ye night / and one day from an other / and wit what day it were and
what time of y^ day / what night and what time of the night / what year and
what time of y^ year / what month and what time of the month. Also god
ordained the^ and made them yt by the tokens and by y^ bodies above men should
know wha^ it were time to sleep and time to wake time to travail and time to
rest / time to halowe and time to labor / time to ete and time to fast /
time to set and time to sow / time to ere time to repe and to mow. And
therefore Salomo^ says Eccliastes.iij. That all thing has his time. and all
thing under heaven passes away by space of time. And so god made the fyrmament
above with bright bodies yt ben therein to serve mankind / and other creatures
also of light and time. Of light as a lantern that may not be quenched. Of
time as an orloge that may not fail. God made hem to serve man and not man to
serve them. He made them for man / and not man for them. He made them not to
govern mam / but he gaaf man and woman wit and dyscreco^n to govern them
self with his grace by the light and wyssynge of time / which he has of the
bodies above / that by their light they may see to work / and by their
styrynge and by their course they may wit when it is time for to work. And
therefore says the law.xxvi. q^. quinto. Non licet in glosa. That the bodies
above ben tokens and not causes of things here byneth. And as a lamp or an
orloge ben necessary to relygyouses by night where by they may rise and rule
them self in gods service / so serve the bodies above to mankind / that we
may have of them bodily light / and by their mouynge know our time for to
serve our god each man and woman in his degree. And as the lamp and ye orloge
in the dortour rule not the relygyouses / but the relygyouses rule them by the
lamp and by the orloge / and in cytees and towns men rule them by the clock
/ and yet proprely to speak / the clock rules not them / but a man rules the
clock. Right so man and woman / be and birds and other creatures rule them
self by the bodies above / and the bodies above rule not them. And therefore
they should not be called governors of this world / for they govern not this
world / they be naught else but Instruments of gods governance For it
fares by god and the bodies above / as it does by the smyth and his gry^dynge
stone / by the wryght and his axe by the orloger and his orloge* Dives. I pray
y^ show me well this. Pauper. Thou see at thyn eye yt when the smyth
gryndeth a knyfe or an are or a sword on his stone / ye stone does naught but
gooth about in one course. And as the smyth that sytteth above will dyspose and
hold / so gryndeth the stone. If he will grynde sharp it shall grynde sharp
/ if he will grynde blunte and plain / it shall grynde blunte and plain /
right as he will yt it grynde / so it gryndeth. If he take away the knyfe axe
or sword / the stone gryndeth right naught / and yet it gooth about the same
course as it did before. Right so it is of god and the bodies above. For the
planetes and the bodies above gone always about in one course certain / in
which god or deyned them at y^ beginning of the world / which course they
shall keep unto the dome. And as god will that they worche / so shall they
work / if god will that they grynde sharp / and cause mo reyne / sekenes /
and tempests hungre and war / and such other they shall do so / if he will
that they grynde plain and smothe and cause health of body / fair weder and
wholesome / plente of corn and vytayles / peace and rest / they shall do so.
Right as god will what that they worche so they shall work. So that god may do
with the planetes what he will / and he may do without the planetes what he
will. In what sign / in what constellaco^n / coniuncco^n / or respect that
they be / they be always ready to fulfill the will of god.

Caplm.xix.
Dives. Sythen god may do with the bodies above what he will and when he will
/ and sythen god is so free in his doing / and not arted by the planetes ne by
none other creature / how should any man know gods domes by the course of y^
planetes / or deem thereby / or tell what god will do in time coming / or
dyuyne of things that be to come Pauper. Thou may not know by the axe what
the wryght will worche ne when. Ne thou may not know by the orloge what time
the orloger will set it ne know the orlogers will. Ne thou may not know by
the gryndstone what the smyth will grynde / ne what manner / ne when. Dives. It
is soth Pauper. No more may we know by the bodies above / ne by the course of
the planet^ what god will do / ne what he will ordeyne of man or of woman / or
of any comunyte / land / royalme / contre or cite / for the planetes and the
bodies above be naught else but gods Instruments / and the course of the
planetes is not chaungeable ne varyable / but it is put in certain meouynge
and steryng which they may not fleene change / for they have no free eleccyon
in their doing. But god is sovereign Judge / most rightful / most merciful
/ most free to punysshe and to spare. For he is most of might / and no thing
may him withstand and therefore his domes and his works be not neded ne arted
by the planetes / but after yt men change their living so chau^geth he his
domes to punysshe or spare / to well or to woe / to heaven or to hell. He demed
the synful cite of Nynyue because of sin to be destroyed within.xl. days /
but when they repented them and amended them and cried after mercy / he
changed his dome and spared the cite / and destroyed it not as tells Jonas
the prophet / and yet the planetes changed not her course for none amendment
of the people. Also we find in holy write the.iiij. book of the kings that
god send the prophet Ysaye to the king Ezechie when he had sinned and badde
him made his testamente for he should deye and no longer live. Anon the king
repented him and wept full sore and axed mercy. And anon god badde the
prophet Ysaye that yet was in the kings halle to go again to the king and say
to him yt god had accepted the repentance and herd his prayer / and that he
should not deye than / but he should live.xv. year longer. Loo my friend how
soon the dome of god was changed all to mercy. And though the planetes yet
that time kept forth their course / they changed not for all the kings
weeping. Dives. Anon after the son changed his course and turned again in
to the eest and began a new day. Pauper. The tournynge again of the son was
not cause of the mercy of god / ne of chau^gyng of domes / for god changed his
dome before or the son turned again. So the tournyng again of the son was
not else but a token of mercy to ye king Ezechie and to all sinful wretches
that would amend them. For right as the son changed his course after y^
repentance of the king. Right so god changed his sentence anon as man or
woman repents him of his sin and is in will to amend him Therefore says
the law De penite^. di.i. sufficiat. Nouit deus mutare sentencia^. si tu
noueris emendare delictu^. God can change his sentence and his dome anon as
y^ canste amend thy trespass. Also it was a token to the king that gods
byhest to him should be fulfilled. But all the astronomers yt ever were could
not tell before of yt wonderful token of the son / for it was all against the
common course of kind / and that and such other show well that god is not
ruled by the course of the planetes / but that god ruled the planetes and not
the planetes him / ne his domes ne his works. But god rules demeth and
governs all mankind person and comunyte after that they deserve / and as
hy^ thinks most spedefull to his worship and to the common prouffyte of his
Royalme in heaven in earth and in hell / whoos domes and ordenau^ces pass
man's wit. And therefore Saint Poule says. Quis cognouit sensum dn^i. aut
quis consiliarius eius fuit. Who says he has known the wit of god / or who
was his counseyller. Forsothe not the astronomers neither the wytches / for
they ben fools of all fools / and put fertheste out of gods counseyll /
as folk that god most hates. Saint Poule says / that domes of god ben
incompre hensyble / no man may know them well / no man may trace his ways.
Tho ben his wonderful domes / they ben so meddled with mercy and rightfulnesse
that they pass man's wit. Therefore the prophet Dauyd says. Universe vie
dn^i misericordia et veritas. All the ways of our lord ben mercy and troth.
Iudicia dn^i abissus multa. The domes of god be of a great depenesse / ye so
deep that no man's wit may seek to the depenesse / ne know well the cause
ne the reason of his wonderful domes. And therefore such astronomers and
wytches that entermeten them so high of gods domes and wonder full works
/ and presume to dyuyne of things that been to come and make them wise as if
they were gods felawes and knew all his preuy counseyll / they ben fools
of al fools Dives. Therefore clerks say that they may no thing tell for
certain / but they may tell whereto man or woman or comunyte is enclyned by
the werkynge of the bodies above. Nevertheless as they say / man and woman
may by virtue overcome the planetes / and so every wise man is lord and
master of the pla^^etes. And therefore Tholomeus the great astronomer says.
Quod vir sapiens dominabitur astris.

Caplm.xx.
ALso as they say by astronomy they may know when men ben enclyned to war or
to peace. And when by common course of kind should fall morayne / hongre /
tempeste / drought / and such other. but as they say one holy prayer may
change every dele. And though it fall not in one co^tree it falls in an
other co^tree. Pauper. Sythen they can not tell for certain what shall
befalle but all in doubt / and their sawes and their domes may so lightly be
changed and brought to naught / it is a great foolye to set any trust to
their tales / for so may every fool tell what he will and excuse every
lesynge. This manner of speech is naught else but a mayntenyng of lesynges and
of faynnyng and of hydynge of folly and a sinful excusaco^n of sin / and a
net to cache with woma^nes souls / and a strenge to draw men to hell / and
to draw man's heart his love and his trust from god. They would feign be
holden wise and nigh of gods counsel / but they wot not how far they be
fonden so false. Ye shall understand my friend that there is but one son and
one moan and other five planetes Saturnus Iupyter Mars Venus and Mercurius /
which with other sterres gone about all the earth with the fyrmamente every
day naturelly / and so pass all the lands / all realms / persons / al
earth / al waters all air in.xxiiij. hours / that is called day naturally /
from son rysynge to son rysyng / from none to none. And sythen they passen
all lands and all persons so euenly / and make no more dwelling over one
land than over an other / why should they more enclyne one land than an other
/ or one person more than an other to vice or to virtue / to war or to peace.
Dives. For some constellacyon or some respect in her passing falls upon one
land more than an other. And as folk ben borne under diverse constellaco^ns
or coniuncco^ns / dyuer se respects in diverse signs and under diverse
planetes / so ben they enclyned in diverse manner and to diverse things / vice
or virtue / war or peace / health or sickness / pouerte or richesse / and
such other. Pauper. When the kings sone is borne / in the same time / in the
same constellaco^n respect planete and sign / is the poor bond man's sone
born / and yet have they not both one inclynaco^n / ne one dysposyco^n. For the
kings sone is dysposed by his heritage to be king after his fader. The poor
bond man's sone is dysposed by his birth to be a bond man all his life as
his faders have been before him hundred years / that no planete might avoid
their bondage / ne fro the kings their dygnyte. In the same time and in the
same constellaco^n and under the same planete and sign that one child is
borne ben many childern borne / and yet have they not all one inclynaco^n ne
one dysposyco^n. For some of them ben enclyned to goodness / and some to
wickedness / some to sickness and some to health / some ben full angry and
some ben not so / some be wise some be fools / some foul some fair / some
rich some poor / some living long and some deye full soon. Ezau and Jacob
had both one fader and one mother. Ysaac and Rebecca both were bygoten at ones /
as says saint Austyn / and both borne attones / and yet were they no thing
like. For Jacob was a good man Ezau a shrewe. Jacob was loved of god Ezau was
hated for his wyckednes. Jacob was smoth of body with little here Ezau fulle
of here as a be. Jacob was a true simple man Ezau a rauenoure and a
malycyous shrewe. Jacob was peasyble Ezau a faytour or a baratour. So thou
might well see that diverse inclynaco^n of man and woman / stands not in the
planetes ne in the time of the birth.

Dives. what else may be cause of such diverse inclynacyons. Pauper. For
Adams sin and orygynall sin there we ben all conceived in we ben all
enclyned to sin. And therefore god says Gen^.viij. That the wit and thought
of man's heart is enclyned to evil from his youth. Sensus et cogitacio cordis
humani in malum prona sunt ab adolescencia sua. And therefore Solomon says
Prouerbiorum.xx. That no man may say. I am pure and clean without sin.
Nevertheless all be we not like much enclyned to sin ne to sickness / but
some more some less and that for many diverse causes. Some time for wicked
suffraunce that childern be not chastysed in her youth For Solomon says
Prouerbiorum.xxix The child that is suffered to have his will shall shame his
mother and all his kynne. Sometime for wicked company that they ben in / and
wicked example of their elders and ylle informaco^n Sometime for mys use in
youth. For Solomon says Prouer.xxij. That a man in his elde goth not lightly
fro the way of his youth. Dives. And yet it is a common proverb / young saint
old devil. Pauper. It is a sinful proverb to draw men to sin fro virtue
/ fro god to the fend. For holy write says. Bonu^ est homini cu^ portauerit
iugu^ dn^i ab adolescencia sua. Tren^.iij. It is fulle good says he to a man
when he has borne the yok of our lord from his youth. And as a poet says.
Quod noua testa capit inueterata sapit. Which as the pot or the vessel
takes when it is new / such it sauoureth when it is old. And therefore in
holy write / saint Johan baptyst. Thoby Jeremy. Sampson. Samuel and many other
ben praised for their holiness in their youth. For commonly they that been good
and love god in godenesse in her youth they make a full good end / all if for
a time they fall in sin and ben full vein. God suffers them to fall for a
time / for they should else be to proud of their goodness / and have
dysdayne of other sinful wretches. Also sometime one is enclyned more to one
sin than a another / for he was conceived and begoten in more sin than an
other / al if he were begoten and born in wedlock / for the man and the wife
may sin togydre full grievously / either by mys will of their bodies / or by
intemperau^ce if they pass manner and mesute / or if they comen togydre in
vntyme / as in the time of sickness / or in holy time without dread or
reverence of the time / ne will not spare for the time. Nevertheless the sin
is in the axer and not in the yelder. Also they may sin by wicked Intencyon /
as if they do it for a wicked end / or oonly to fulfill the lust of the
flesh / not to flee fornycacyon / ne to yield the death of their body / ne
to bring forth childern to the worship of god / but oonly taken head of her
own lust. Also if they coueyte childern not to the worshypp of god / but for
the world to be great / and to make their childern great in this world. Also
men be enclyned to sin one more than an other by excess of mete and drink /
by myskepynge of his five wits. And for this same causes one is enclyned to
bodily sickness more than an other. For sin oftyme is cause of bodily
sickness. Also by mys dyetynge of the mother while she is with child / or by
mys dysposycyon of the fader / or of the mother / or of both / when the child
is begoten / or by mys keeping of the child in the youth. For childern in
youth will assaye and handle well nyghe all thing. And so oftyme they ete and
drink and receive inward many unthrifty things and enuenym herself and hurt
themself in many wise / yt but if the good angel kept them not they should
perysshe. Also god smyteth them with seknesse of myschyef. Sometime for the
faders sin and the moths / for they love them to much / and will go to
hell to make them rich and great in this world. Sometime he smyteth them with
sekenes to show his might and miracle as we find in y^ gospel of saint
Johan.ix.c. Of him that was born blind / that the might of god might be showed
in him in gyuyng him sight Other causes there ben full many which passen man's
wit / for we may not know all gods domes. Ne these causes here assygned be
not always general. For sometime a full good man has a full shrewed child /
some good some bad. And sometime a full wicked man has a full good child. For
if the childern followed always the fader and the mother in goodesse or in
wickedness / all the goodness should be arected to the fader and to the mother
/ and not to god. And they should be proud both fader / mother / and child /
and comyne togydre flesshly to much. And in the same manner all the shrewednesse
should be arected to the fader and mother all if it came on other behalf / and
they should ever be sorry and fall in dyspayre / and not will yield to them
togydre the debt of their body. And therefore god medleth so one with an other
/ and so modefyeth his domes that the good should not presume of himself ne be
to proud / but thank god of all / ne the wicked be to sorye and so fall in
dyspayre / but trust in god that so of the wicked makes the good / and of the
unclean makes the clean.

Caplm.xxij.
Dives. They say that as childern be born under diverse sins / so ben they
enclyned and dysposed to diverse crafts and diverse astates. If he be borne
under some sign they say that he shall be a fyssher / and under some a
monyour / and under some a clerk / under some a man of arms. Pauper. Many
contrees know no money ours ne money neither. And many contrees ben there that
have money / yet they have no monyours. For in a full great realm of.vi.
hundred mile in length / and.ij. hundred of bread be no monyours but in one
place assygned by the king / not by the signs ne by the bodies above. The king
assygneth both the place and them that shall make the money / not the bodies
above. And if any does make money but tho that y^ king has ordained / he
shall be slain as a tray toure / the signs neither the planetes shall not
save his life. And they that be born nyghe the sea / or nyghe some great water
/ give them to fysshynge and their childern also / not for the sins that
they be born in / but for the most oportunyte of their living which they have
by the water that is so nyghe. They that been borne fer from the sea give them
to tylthe the land. Sometime to clothe making if there be plente of wulle. Some
ben shepeherdes / some monyours or money quyners / some vynours / some of
other crafts as the contre axeth / not after the signs ne the bodies above
When a man has many childern he puts them to diverse crafts for to get
their living. Men of arms put their childern to arms. And commonly every man
that can ought or has ought whereby he may live / he puts some of his
childern in the same degree to get their living. And thou may well see that
such dyuer syte in craft or in living stands more in the childs fader and
his friends that ordained so for him / than it does in the signs or in the
planetes. For if they should abide ye ordenau^ce of the planetes they should
deye for hongre / for they teache them right naught ne ordeyne no more for one
than for an other. Dives. Sith such Inclynacyon stands lyryll or naught in
the planetes / what is that destenye that men speak so much of. And as they
say all thing falls to man and woman by destenye.

Caplm.xxiij.
PAuper. Foles speak as foles. For as says saint Gregory in his Omely of the
Epyphanye there is no such destenye. Absit a cordibus fideliu^ vt aliquid esse
fatu^ dicant. God forbede says he that any christian man or woman should believe
or say that there were any destenye. But god says he that made man's life of
naught / he rules and governs man's life and womannes after that they
deserve / and as his rightwysnesse and his mercy axeth. And he says that man
was not made for the sterres / but the sterres were made for man. Dives. The
gospel is against the. For we find in the gospel yt anon as Christ was borne
of the maiden / his sterre appeared in the Eest / in token that each man and
woman is born under a certain sterre and under a certain constellacyon the
which is called his destenye / for all his living after following is governed
thereby / as these astronomers sayen. Pauper. For to mayntene folly they say
many folly and ben not asshamed for to lie. For that sterre had no maystry ne
lordshypp upon that blessed child But the child was maystre and lord of that
sterre. The sterre governed not the child / but the child governed the
sterre. The child sought not that sterre / but that sterre sought the child.
The child served not the sterre / but the sterre served y^ child / and did
him full high worship and full wonderful service / and therefore it was called
the childs sterre / for ye child was lord of the sterre as he was of all the
other. For he was and is lord of son moan and of all the sterres and of all
thing / and they may not conferme their le synges ne their false domes of
astronomers by that sterre. For it was no planete ne sterre of the fyrmamente
/ as saint Austyn says and other doctors of holy church / and reason and
other causes shows it full well. Dives. How. Pauper. For as these clerks
tellen. Minima stella fixa mayor est tota terra. The least sterre set fast
in the fyrmamente is more than all the earth within the sea and without the sea
/ and every planete also is more than all the earth outake the moon and mercury
which be somdele less than all the earth. And therefore sometime they lose
their light that they have of the son by the shadow and the vmbre of the
earth when it falls right between the son and them. And if that sterre had been so much or any such sterre it should have overwhelmed all the earth / for
it went full low nygh the earth to lead and to bring the kings in their
way. Also the sterres of the fyrmament and the planetes follow the course of
the fyrmament / and rise up in the eest and go down in the weste every day
naturelly. That sterre did not so / for it was above the earth both night and
day and followed not the course of the fyrmament / but it held his course as
the way led best in to the cite of Bethleem for to bring the kings in their
way to the son of rightwysnesse that there roose out of that clear fyrmament
yemayden Marye / and as the son from under the earth. Also the sterres in the
fyrmament shynen by night and not by day That sterre shone both night and day
Also the sterres of the fyrmament show themself to all men commonly both poor
and rich young and old. That sterre appeared not but to the three kings and
their company. Also the sterres of the fyrmamente ben perpetuell and always
lasting / that lasted but a lytyl while twelve months at most as some
clerks say / and some say but xiiij. days or less. Dives. What manner
sterre was it than. Pauper. Some clerks tellen that is was an angel in the
likeness of a sterre. For the kings had no knowing of angellys / but took
all head to the sterre. Some say that it was the same child that lay in the
ox stalle which appeared to the kings in the likeness of a sterre / and so
drew them and led them so to him self in Bethleem. And therefore holy
church syngeth and says. Iacebat in presepio et fulgebat in celo. He lay
full low in the cratche and he shone full bright above in heaven. But the common
sentence of the clerks is that it was a new sterre newely ordained of god to
show the birth of Christ. And anon as it had done the office that it was
ordained for / it turned again to the matter that it come fro.

Caplm.xxiiij.
Dives. How might they know by the sterre that such a child was born / for
that sterre could not speak to them / ne tell no such tales. Pauper. That is
sothe / and therefore says saint Austyn openly in a sermon that the sterre did
naught else by his apperyng but brought them in wonder and in great study
for to know what it might sygnefye. And when they were at their wits end
/ and knew well that her craft served them not / than god showed them by
Inspyraco^n inward / or else by an angel what it betokened and badde them
follow the sterre. And the same says saint Johan with the gylden mouth upon
Mathewe. They knew well by Balames prophecye that such a child should be
born / but they knew it not by the craft of astronomye / ne might know by
their craft / neither the time of his birth ne the place / as the gospel
shows well. Dives Why says than Saint Austyn and other clerks / that the
science of Iudycyall astronomye of childrens birth was lefull unto the time of
Crystus birth sythen they might not by that science know his birth.xxvi.
q^.iiij. igitur. But as they say it was not lefull neither granted after his
birth. Pauper. Saint Austyn says not that the craft was lefull or granted
to do / ne that it was lefull to trust therein / for it was always false and
repreued of god and of phylosophres by skylle and reason. But he says that the
science of the craft was lefull and granted of god / not the doing yt by the
science men might repreue the craft / and the science also / and show by
their own pryncypalles and grou^des that the craft is false / and that the
science is no science proprely to speak / but open folly / as it was well
preued in Crystus birth. And for it was so openly preued falls in his birth /
therefore after his birth it is not lefull to use it ne to conne it / but oonly
to repreue the folly of them yt use it. The doing of the craft was unlawful
both before and after. The science was suffered of god both before and after
for to repreue folly / as the law shows full well distinct.xxxvij. De mensa.

Caplm.xxv.
Dives. Where fyndeste thou that god defends the Iudycyall of astronomye
before Crystus birth. Pauper. Exodi. xx. In the first commandment of the
first table / of which is now our speech / where as god badde that men should
make them no likeness of yt yt is in heaven. But such astronomers make them
self like asmoche as they may to god in heaven / in asmoche as they take to
them that lo^geth oonly to god / for oonly god knows when such things as
they make them wise of should fall and how and where. And therefore god
repreueth them and says to them. Nunciate que ventura sunt in futurum.et
sciemus qr dij estis vos. Ysaye.xli. Tell ye to us things that been to come
after this / and than shall we know that ye be gods. And therefore says the
law.xxvi. q^.iiij. igitur. That they call them self dyuynes as if they were
full nygh to god and knew all gods counseyll / and by faynynge and falshode
coniecte and tell to the people things that been to come as they were full of
godhode and gods felawes. And in this manner they and all such trespassen
full hyghely against the first commandment. For they maken them like to god
in heaven / and the worshypp that longs oonly to god they take it to them
self. Such presumpco^n and pride lost angellys kind and mankind also. For
as we find Ysaye.xiiij. Lucyfer said in his heart that he should stye up unto
heaven / and set his seet above the sterres / and sytt in the mount of the
testament. And that he should go up above the hight of the clouds / that is to
say above all angellys and be like to him that is highest. But anon he fell
down to hell / and so shall such astronomers and wytches / but if they
amend them. For they set their wits and their study and their faith so
much in the sterres / that they will pass the sterres and all creatures and
be like god that is highest. They will also sytte in the mount of the
testamente / for they will be against gods laws and have forth their domes
will it god or not. For if their craft were true / the testamente of gods
law should serve for naught / and so gods law / holy church law / skyll
and reason should serve for naught. For there is noman worthy to be punysshed
for a sin that he may not flee / ne worthy to be rewarded for a good deed
that he may not leave. But for that man does well when he might do amysse / he
is worthy to be rewarded. And for that he does evil when he might do well and
leave his mysdede and will not / he is worthy much pain. But if he were
compelled by the bodies above to virtue or to vice / he were neither worthy for
to have mede ne pain. This pride and presumpco^n lost also Adam and Eve and
all mankind. For when the fend said to them yt they should be as gods
knowing good and evil / they assented to him and ete of the apple against
godds commandment. For they would have be as gods and like god knowing
good and evil / and have known what was to come. We find also Deutro. xviij.
That when god led the childern of Israel out of Egypt in to the land of
byhest / he forbode them the Iudycyall of astronomye and all manner of wytche
crafts / and badde that they should axe no counsel of none such dyuynours
ne wytches. For I shall says he destroy the nacyons yt ye gone to / for they
have used such crafts / and if ye use them I shall also destroy you. We
find also Ysaye xlvij. That god repreued the people of Babylon and the Caldeis
of their wytche crafts and of their astronomye that they trusted most in. For
of all naco^ns they gaaf them most that time thereto / and said to them in
this wise / wydowehede and baraynhede shall come to the both in one day for
ye multitude of thy wytches / and for ye hardenesse of thy charmerys. And for
that thou had trust in such malice / thy conning and thy science has
dysceyued the. Disease and woe shall fall to the / and you shall not know fro
whens it comes. Sudden myschyef shall fall to the / and thou may it not
flee. Stand says he with thy charmers and with the multitude of thy wytches
in which thou haste trauaylled from thy youth. Look if they may ought help
the either strength the ayenste thyn enemies. Thou haste failed and thou
shalt fail in the multitude of thy cou^seyles that thou haste taken of such
folk. Let now says he thy dyuynoures of heaven stand and save the if they
may. They that stare so against the sterres and look after the planetes / and
calculen and casten years days and months for to tell the things that been
to come / they shall not help the / they can or may not help the. For as
saint Poule says. There is no counseyll against god. Also this craft of
astronomye is repreued Sapienc.xiij. by the wise Solomon / where he repreueth
them that meende and said that son moan and sterres were gods of this
world / for governance longs to none vnwytty thing / as son and moan and
sterres ben / but goueruaunce longs only to wytty things skylfull and
reasonable and understanding / as to god that is sovereign wisdom to angel
and man. Vnwytty bodies with their virtues and their might and their kinds or
natures be naught else but Instruments of gods governance and also of
angellys governance and of man's also if they can well use them. Also such
Iudycyall of astronomy is repreued by the law of holy church.xxvi. q^.iiij.
igit. et distinct.xxxvij. legimus etc^. qui de mensa. Also saint Poule
repreueth such craft of astronomye / ad Galathas iiij. Ye keep says he days
and months years and times as hethen people does. And therefore I dread me
says he that I have trauayled in vein about you for to convert you all. And
the gloss in the same place repreueth such craft of astronomye full hard.
Such science god repreueth as says saint Poule in his pystle.i. ad Little.i. I
shall says god lose the wisdom of the wise / and the slyght of the slyght /
and of them that trust so much in their co^nyng / where more over saint
Poule says thus. Where is now the wise man that lets and trusts so well
by his wit / where is now the man of law with all his cautelles / where is
now the seker of nature and of the course of kind of this world God says he
has turned ye wysdom of this world into folly

Caplm.xxvi.
Dives* Such science and wysedom so for to dyuyne of things to come which
stands in the will of god / and often in the free will of man or woman. I
hold it a great folly. There can none astronomer by his craft tell me my
thoughts / ne what I purpose me to do in time coming / ne how I shall led my
life. They know not my cou^seyl all if they see me and speak with me How
should they know gods counsel or what he will do in time coming sythen
they see him not and they speak never with him. They can not tell before ne
beware of their own myshappes / how should they tell of other men or women /
or warn them by their craft of their adventure. For commonly such dyuynours
of astronomye ben in great myschyef and myshappe as much as other or more /
and they know it not tylle it fall. and the more that they work by their
craft the worse they speed. Pauper. That is no wonder. For the more that they
trust in their craft / the less they trust in god / and the less they
trust in god in whom is all our welthe or help / the worse they shall speed.
And the more that they trust in their craft ye more they trust in folly /
and the more that they trust in folly the more folly and myschyef shall follow
him. There will no wise man write his counseyll and all that he thinks to do
in the year following in the roof of his halle / ne about on the walls where
all men may see it and know it. No more will god write his counsel ne what
he thinks to do in time coming above in the fyrmamente there all fools
might know his counsel his thoughts and his domes. Christ hid many
things from his apostles and said to them Non est vestru^ nosse tempora vel
momenta q^ pater posuit in sua potestate Actuu^ primo. It longs not to you to
know times momentes and stou^des which the fader of heaven has resceyued in
his power. And he says by the prophet. Secretu^ meu^ michi. secretu^ meu^
michi. Ysaye.xxiiij. I keep my pryuyte to me. I keep my pryuyte to me. And
sythen he reserved and kept such counseyll and pryuyte from his friends that
were so nygh of cou^seylle. Much more he reserved and kept his counseyll from
his enmyes fool sinful wretches. Dives. These clerks say that they may by
craft of astronomye lefull tell and dyuyne of drought / of rain / of tempeste
/ for they fall by common course of kind / and therefore they may by common
course of nature know them and tell them before. Pauper. As I said first /
the course of kind and of the planetes stands all in the will of god and do
therewith what he will / as the Instrument stands in the werkemannes will what
he will do therewith. And therefore they may not know by their craft ne by the
course of the planetes as by cause / neither of droughte ne of wete ne tempeste
coming. But they may know by the bodies above / as by tokens both of drought
of wete / of tempeste / froste / snow / wind / thondre / and such other /
and so knows the shepeherde in the field / the shypman in the sea / the bird
in the air / the fysshe in the water / and the bestes in the wode better than
all the astronomers in this land.

Caplm.xxvij.
Dives. How may the bodies above be tokenes of such things and not causee.
Pauper. Falling of soote in houses is token of rain soon coming / and yet
it is not the cause of the rain / but the rain is cause of the sote falling
For when the air wereth moist / the soote by moisture of the air wexeth heavy
and falls down. And so the falling of the sote is token of great moisture
in the air. Also swetynge of water on the stoones is a token of rain / and
yet it is not cause of the rain / but rain and moisture of the air is cause
of the water. Also meltyng of salt when it tourneth in to water is token of
rain coming / but not the cause. Also smoke in houses when it passes not
redely out is token of rain / for the air is so thycke and heavy of moisture
that the smoke may not stye up so redely as when the air is dry and clear
Also the broughe or cercle about the candell light is token of rain. And the
blewe glowynge of the fire is a token of the froste / but not the cause. These
and such other ben tokenes of weder coming / but not the causes. For they
show the dysposyco^n of the air whether it is dysposed to droughte or to
wete. And in the same manner the bodies above ben tokenes of weder coming. For
by their light and manner of shynynge they show the dysposyco^n of the air
wete or dry froste or snow / thondre / lyghtnyng / wind / and such other.
And as the light in the lantern shows dysposyco^n and color of the lantern
/ and yet is not the light cause of such dysposyco^n ne of the color of the
lantern. And as the light of the son or moan shows the dysposyco^n of the
glass that it passith by whether it be white or blake / blewe or read / yelowe
or grene / and yet is not the son ne the moon cause of the color. Right so
they show the dysposycyon of the air / and yet ben they not always cause of
such dysposycyon. And therefore the moon in one lunacyon and in the same time
shows in one contree great tokenyng of rain / and so it falls / and
twenty mile thens it shows great tokenynge of drought and so it falls / and
yet is it the same moan and the same lunacyon. And therefore the cause of that
dyuersyte is not in the moon / but in the air. For the air in one contree is
dysposed to rain / and in the other to drought. Also in one contree it shows
wind and tempeste / and in another contree not so. Some contree is full hot
by shynynge of the son and some contree is not so hot. One day is full hot
/ and the next day after is full cold. The son shows his light one time
of the day / and an other time of the day it shows not / which dyuersyte
stands not in the son / but in the air and other causes. For the son in
himself as the clerks sayen is always at one and shyneth always all like /
it is neither hoter ne colder. But such dyuersyte falls by dyuersyte of the
air / and other diverse means and causes which passen man's wytt. Some time
such anenture and hongre / of morayne / of tempeste / of drought / of wete
falls by the ordenaunce of god for man's sin / or for to show his might
and his worship. Sometime by werkynge of angellys good or wicked at gods
bidding. Some time without mean oonly at his will and his bidding. Sometime
by the werkynge of the bodies above at his bidding. For as I said first /
he may do with the planetes what he will / and he may do without them what he
will. And therefore by the course of the planetes may we not know such
adventures as bycauses but as by tokens. For god made them for to be tokenes
to man / be / bird / fysshe / and other creatures as I said first. And
therefore we should take heed to them oonly as to tokenes and not to causes. Ne
dyuyne by hem as by causes / for we wot not when they ben causes of such
things / ne when they be none.

Caplm.xxviij.
Dives. The moon as the derkes sayen is the cause of flowynge and of the
ebbynge of the sea / for it follows the course of the moon. Pauper. It may
well be so. But I wot well that the course of the moon is a token when that
the sea shall ebb and flow / and the sea keeps his time of ebbynge and
flowynge after the course and the time of the moon in one contree sooner and in
an other later. And yet every see does not so / but oonly one part of the
weste see that goth about Brytayne and Irlonde / and other lands nygh because
of tho. But in other far contrees / ne in the Greeks see is no such ebbynge
ne flowynge. So it seems that there be other causes of that ebbyng and that
flowyng than the moon allone. But sothe it is that man and be / bird and
fysshe / the sea and the air / tree and grass / and all other creatures use
and keep their doing in kind / and werken in time that god has ordained to
them which time they know well by the course of the son moan and sterres.
For as Solomon says Ecclesiastes.iij. All thing has his time ordained of god
by way of kind which time they know and keep by the course of the bodies
above / which ben tokenes to them showing what time they should do their
kind that they ben ordained to. And therefore god says by the prophet
Ieremye. viij. The puttoke in the air says he knows his time / the turtyll
and the swalowe keep the time of her coming. But the people know not the dome
of our lord god. For now a days men take none head to gods domes / but to
the domes of astronomers and to the course of the planetes. The kind of every
creature is ordained by the dome of god / and what time he shall do his kind
which time they know and feel by the course of the bodies above. For as says
the phylosophre / the bodies here above mesure all things here bynethe as
anentes time. And therefore says Dauyd. That by night when the son is down /
than in derkenesse begin bestes of raueyn to walk and seek their pray and
their mete / when the son ryseth they go again to her dens and hyde them /
than goo men out to work till it be night / not that the son ne the moon
cause hem to do so but only the law of kind ordained of god techeth hem so to
do and to keep their kyndly time. In the dawynge and spryngyng of the day
birds begy^ne to sing / flowers to sprede and spring that by night were full
close. Man bird and best begin to glad for Joy of the light / and for
the time of their myrthe and of their kyndly werkyng comes again by the
presence of the son which serves them pryncypally of light and of time.
The son rules them not proprely to speak / but kind rules them in time by
the course of the son and by the course of the bodies above. We find in holy
write Gen^.i. That the earth at the bidding of god brought forth trees grass
and herbs. Trees and herbs brought forth their fruit / each in their own
kind. The third day er god made son moan and sterres. And badde the earth
and gave it virtue and nature to bring forth grass and fruit of many and
diverse kind. He gave not the son ne the moon ne sterres that nature. He
made them the fourth day to shine and to be in tokenes of time to all
creatures here bynethe in earth. God gave grass trees and herbs diverse
virtues and wonderful nature to bud and bring forth leaves fair and grene in
diverse form / flowers fair blossoms bryghte of diverse shappe and of
diverse colors that no man by craft can deuyse. Also he gave them nature to
bring forth fruit fair and fine / some in the winter and some in the somer.
Some he ordained in time to lose their leaves and their grenehede. Some to be
grene winter and somer / as lorell / box / holme / yue / and many moo. When
other herbs sere and dry up / than in the cold weder saffrone begins to
spring / and with his flowers brings his fruit. Such dyuersyte in kind in
tree and in grass / in be fysshe and foul / virtues so diverse in stoones
and other things devised never ne made the son ne moan ne the sterres. But
he that made son moan and sterres / and all thing in kind / he made and
ordained / and he governs and keeps all this each in his own kind / and
has assygned each creature here bynethe his due time / his nature to do and
to show. In one land falls hongre / and in an other place plente of all
goods. In one land is plente of wine / and in an other none. In one contree
is plente of wulle good and clean / and in other little and full vnthende. In
one contree is plente of gold and silver and of other metalle / and in another
little or naught. Sometime is morayne general / and sometime parcyal in one
contree and not in an other. Some time in one town and not in the next.
Sometime in that one side of the street and not in that other. Some householde
it takes up all hole / and in the next it takes none. Some deye in yougthe /
and some in elde / some in myddell age / some well / some evil / some with
little pain / and some with much pain. How should men know or tell all this
dyuersyte by the bodies above or assygne causes thereto / or to such other
without nombre by the course of the planetes.

Dives. It passes man's wit. Oonly god that made all he knows all. They
ben his domes his ordenau^ce / and therefore me thynked great folly that men
entremete them so high of gods domes / and namely of things that been to
come. But I pray the tell me if the wonders that fall against kind in the
bodies above betokenen or she we any auentures that been to come. Pauper. That
falls against common course of kind betokens that some thing is coming
passing the common course of kind be it well be it woe. But commonly such
wonders fall more against woe than against welthe as cometes and sterres brennyng
castelles in the air. Eclypses of y^ son or moan against kind / men in the
air armed or fighting / the raynebowe turned up so down / mysshape things
in their birth against kind These and such other that fall against common
course of kind betoken that the people where they appear done against kind /
and that lord of nature is offended with them / and all creatures redye to
punysshe them. Dives. It may well be as thou say / for many such have
appeared within few years never so many I trow in so little while. And much
sorrow and woe follows after as we feel here and see. But I pray the what
betokened that wonderful comete and sterre which appeared upon this land /
the year of our lord a thousand four hundred and two from the feste of the
Epyphanye tylle two wekes after Eester that was in the myddell of Aprylle.
Pauper. It was an open token of the great offense to god with the people of
England / and that hard wretch was coming but if they would amend them of
her falshode and traytourye / periurye / murdre / myspryde in every degree and
ouerdone / couetyse / erroures and heresye / blasphemye and ydolatrye / lechery
and lesynges without shame / and other sins many moo / not oonly preuy but
open to all crystendome and sclaundre to all christian people. And for that men
repent them not ne will not amend them but put sin to sin. And by
sin of falsehode / murdre / and manslaughter / travail for to mayntene their
old sins / therefore vengeance falls as the sterre betokened. God of his
mercy smyteth not all at ones / but little and little / that by the little
men should beware of the more. But allas there ben but few or no man that will
be ware or amend him / but always do worse and worse. They give no ^a^e of
gods sword / but every contre is glad of others disease / uneaths any man
or woman has pity on other / but nygh every man is glad of others woe. And so
I dread me that god will make an end of this land / for we love no peace / we
seek no mercy. But all our liking is all in war / in woe / in murdre / and in
shedynge of blood / in robberye and in falsehode / and our business by night
and day is to mayntene our sin and to offend god. And more over they have
ordained a common law that what man speak with the troth against their falshode
/ he shall be hanged drawn and be heded. Dives. Thy sawes ben full soth and
open at eye. Every state and every degree in this land is now given to sin
and besy to meyntene sin. But I pray the what say clerks of such cometes
and sterres so apperynge against the common course of kind. Pauper. They say
that when it appears it sygnyfyeth moreyne or chau^gyng of some great prince /
or destrucco^n of some contre / or chau^gyng of some realm / or great werre or
hongre or wonderful tempest. Dives. War hongre and tempest and moreyne we
have had great plente / and many contrees in this realm ben destroyed and
changed in to other lordshyp and nacyons sythen the sterre appeared first. And
it is full like that in short time both the king and all the realm shall be
changed and destroyed. Pauper. Salomo^ says that for gyle and traytoury and
diverse wrongs and despytes done to god and to holy church / realms ben
changed from nacyon to naco^n. This matter is full heavy and doleful. Speak we
of somewhat else.

Caplm.xxx.
Dives. All if it be so that the Iudycyall of astronomye be repreued of god and
of holy church / yet experyence shows that often they tell many trouthes of
things that been to come and of preuy things that been done. Pauper. Sometime
they happen to say such trouthes / as the blind man cast the staf. And
sometime they know such things by other way than by astronomye / and that
they know by other way they say that they know it by astronomye For they
would feign be holden wise and nerer of gods conseyll than any other. Dives.
How may they know any such things on other half Pauper. Sometime by book of
prophecye / sometime by conjecture of diverse causes and dysposyco^ns that gone
before. As if man give him to wicked company / or use suspecte places / men
that wot it will coniecte thereof and say that in time coming it shall be his
confusyon. Also if a man mys dyete him and ete and drink out of mesure / and
thing that is not conuenyent to him men will say that he shall be seek thereof.
And if a man give him for to false the kings seal or y^ kings money / than
will they say that he shall be hanged and drawn / and commonly it falls so.
Also they know things that been to come by coniectyng of diverse tales and
speech in the people / as if common clamoure of the people be against their king
when their king trusts upon them / it is a token that the people shall undo
hy^ or he be ware. And in this manner the se days the most part of the people
ben prophets and tell things that been to come / which things they ben
about to perform in heart word and deed. And childern also by that they here
their elders speak ben and have been prophets nygh in every house. Also they
know such things by dyscoueryng of cou^seyl or knowing of counsel of them
that purpose such things. And sometime they be of the same counsel and of
the assente and helping thereto. And in this manner these faytours that been
called sothe sayers and astronomers / sometime tell things preuy and do come
again things that been stolen or lost / for commonly such ben thieves or of
their assent. And by one sothe saw or tweyne which they know in this manner /
they blind the nyce people and make them to believe all their lesynges. And
therefore if any such faytours did any thing come again that were stolen / he
should be taken as a thief or a thieves feere. And commonly such faytours and
Iapers have masters to have part of their winning / as tauerners brewers
hostlers / and nedy werkelesse men that go so gay and spend great / which
aspye after things that been done in the co^tree / and that yet ben to be done
/ and tell them to the faytours to do them have a name. And often they that
should keep most counseyll / dyscouer counsel / and so that men yt he wend
were counsel is no counsel. And commonly such faytours be slye spekers /
and slyghly can oppose the sheepherde and the plowman in y^ field or some old
simple folk or childern at the towns end / and axen how it stands among
the neighbors and in the contree about / and after that they tell them they
make them wise as if they knew it by astronomye or by prophecye / or by
nygromancye. And for as much as they ben unknown / and tell sothes that men
know / than the people weneth that they know all things / and might know
what they would / and so believe in them till they ben all dysceyued. Sometime
such faytours tell sothes not by their craft but by techyng and falshode of
the fend which is always ready if god suffered him to seche foles for to
dysceyue them and other by them.

Caplm.xxxi.
Dives. How may the devil know things that been to come other any preuy
sin. Pauper. Better than any man. For as saint Austyn says de natura
demonu^.xxvi.q^.iiij. sciendu^. The fend is more sotyll of wit and ferther
can see and cast than any man. Also he is more lyghter and swftyer in sterynge
and passing. For he is ten fold lyghter than any foul in his fleing. Also
he may lightly know what is done in diverse contrees and lands. He is so
sotyll in kind that there may no door neither wall shytte him out of counsel
/ and so he may here and see what men and women do though it be full preuy.
Also by long experyence / for they have lived so long that they can tell and
cast by way of kind many things that be to come / and can do many things
that pass man's wit. Also oftymes they have leave of god for man's sin
for to do wondres / to cause hydeous tempests / to enfecte and enuenym the
air / and cause morayne and sickness / hongre and drought / dyscensyon and
war by destruccyon of chary^e / by myspryde / couetyse / lechery / wrath and
envy / and such things as they done and pursue them to do and have done
aforne and made other to do they can not tell it before. Also by the signs of
the body outward they know the dysposyco^n of man or woman inward / signs
to health or to sickness / to vice or to virtue / or often by tokens outward
they know man's thought inward. But for as much as they may not know it
for certain such things / for only god knows for certain things that been
to come / and oftyme god lets them of their malice when y^ men will amend
them. Therefore the proud spyryte will not tell such things to the people
suddenly by him self / but easily by other y^ set their faith and their
trust in him / as ben wytches faytours astronomers / that if their sawes be
fou^den falls / they shall have the velonye / if it be fou^den true the fend
shall have the worship. Also they may know the things y^ is to come by book
of prophecye which they understand by naturell wit better than any man.

Caplm.xxxij.
Dives. Sothe it is that nygh every sin be it never so preuy / it is done by
the techyng and entysyng of the fend. And therefore it is wonder that any
lecherye / theft and myschyef / murdre / lesynges and other sins may be
hid and kept preuy sythen the fend knows it so well / and may know
things that been so preuy by so many ways as thou haste now here said.
Pauper. Full feign would the fend dyscouere man's sin and womannes to
bring them to shame and velonye / and so to destroy charity / and make
every man for to slay other But god of his mercy lets him / for he may
naught do ne tell but as he has a grant of god. And therefore as we find in
the gospel Math.viij. The fend might not enter in to the swyne that wend
there besides for to drenche hem tylle he had a grant of Christ. Also he
might not disease Job / neither in his body ne in his catell till he had a
grant of god. Job.i. et.ij. And he could not dysceyue king Achab with
lesynges and fayte byhestes to do him to fight there he might live in peace /
yet he might not do it till he had a grant of god. The third book of
kings the.xxij. chapter. He knows much thing by the suffraunce of god /
but he may naught do without grant and permyssyon or suffrau^ce of god. The
fend is so feeble and so faint that he may no man ne woman overcome by
temptaco^n but he will be overcome of him. Ne he may not dear the least child
in the way but he have a grant of god which sometime granted him power
thereto for the sin of fader and mother Dives. Why suffers god him so much
to tempte mankind. Pauper. To manyfolde or encresynge of our bliss and of our
mede. For as saint Poule says. There is no man worthy for to have the crown
of life but he withstand the fend in ghoostly strife. And as he says in an
other place / god suffers him not to tempte us but as we may well withstand
if we will. And if we fall he has ordained to us remedy of penance / soon
to rise again and better to fight if we will. And all our temptacyon shall
turn us to mede if our will be to withstand it. Dives. Sythen the fend
knows so many treuthes and wot what is done / for he is at every wicked deed
/ me meruaylleth much why he is so redye to lie and why he is so false.
Pauper. For he hates god that is sovereign treuthe / and for he might not be
even with god in soueraynte of treuthe / ne have the name of sovereign treuthe
that is god / therefore his lykyng and his trauayll is to be sovereign falshede
and soueraynly false. And therefore Christ says in the gospel that the fend
stood never in treuthe / for there is no treuthe in him when he speaks he
speaks lesynges by way of kind / for he is a liar and fader of all lesynges.
Ioha^nes.viij. And so whether his tale be true or false / say he sothe or
false / always he is felse / and always a liar.. Dives. How may he say treuthe
and yet lie / for if he says treuthe me thinks he lies not. Pauper. What
so ever man or fend does / or speaks against good conscience and against the
pleasaunce of god in will and in Intencyon for to dysceyue man woman or child
/ it is a lesynge / and he is a liar that does it or says it. And therefore the
law shows well.xxij. q^.ij. hoies and^. is aute^. That if a man say a
treuthe / which treuthe he wened be false / if he say it for to dysceyue his
even christian / in that he lies. And so with a soth saw a man or ye fend may
lie / as if I say to the yt it were not day to let the of thy Journey wenyng
my self that it were not day all though it were as I said yet I lie. And in
the same manner the fend tells treuthis of things that been to come / and
other sothes also / wenynge him self that they be false. And so in his sothe
sawes he lies / for he says that treu the vnwyttyngly for dysceyte and weneth
to say false. And if he say any treuthe wyttyng and wyllyng / he says it
oonly for to dysceyue men / and for a wicked end / and for to do folk with
one soth saw to believe an hundred lesynges / and so he is always false and
dysceyuable. And sometime he is compelled by the might of god to tell treuthes
against his will / to shame and to shenshyp of him and all his / as we find in
the gospel Math.viij Marce.i. Luce.iiij. et.vij. But for such sothe sawes is
he never the trewer but always a false liar / for such sothe sawes ben against
his will / and if he may he will turn him all to dysceyte / and make men for
such sothe sawes when they fall to believe all his lesynges. And therefore he is
called in holy write. Spiritus mendax. spiritus fallax. That is to say a
spyryte liar and a spyryte dysceyuable. And therefore as the fendes had said
the treuthe that Christ compelled them to say / anon he put them to scylence
as says the gloss in the same place for they would else under that sothe saw
have told many lesynges.

Caplm.xxxiij.
Dives. When he is coniured he is so bound by virtue of holy words that he
must needs say truth which he knows if it be axed him. Pauper. Such
wytches and charmers. Iapers and faytours that use such crafts have no power
to bind him ne to compelle him to tell such sothes / ne right naught for to
do ne for to tell. For he may naught do ne tell without to have grant of
god. And therefore such Iapers and wytches bind not the fend / but the fend
byndeth them full hard in his seruage / and keeps them thralles to him
passing all other / whose boundage is full hard to them for to escape
without a special grace of god. Dives Contra Often men know that clerks close
hem in rings and in other things and make hem to tell and to do many
wondres. Pauper. The fend fayneth him to be bound with such Iapers words
for to dysceyue them and other by them / and yet is he not closed ne bound /
but he gooth abroad as he did before / and when he is called he is sometime
ready to answer for he is full swyfte / some time he is not ready to answer /
ne to do their will / and often though he would he may not / for god will not
suffer him. Dives. Yet contra te. Men wot well that in many lands prestes and
clerks with holy coniuraco^ns and holy prayers ordained of holy church catch
wicked spyrytes out of men and wymen. Pauper. That is soth / and not oonly good
lyuers / but wicked lyuers in many lands catch fendes out of men and wymen
and childern by the virtue of gods words / and holy coniuracyons and holy
prayers ordained of holy church / and sooner a good man or a good woman shall
do that than a wicked. Such bind the fend and do him lose his power and his
lordshyp to shame and shenshyp of him and all his. Such seek the worship of
god and shenshypp of the fend and help of man's soul. And therefore they
have power of god to bind hy^ and to compelle him. But yet as the gloss says
Marce. v. super illud. Quod est tibi nomen. They that been so trauaylled with
the fend must first be clean shreuen as far as they may and know and tell
all the manner of the fendes doing / and of the temptacyon that they have
either waking or slepynge / by sight / by herynge / by feeling / or by any of
their wits / or by any thought or fantasye / and dyscouere all the fendes
counseyll. But the se wytches faytours and Iapers seek the fendes worship and
not gods worship. They seek help of the fend and forsake gods help / and
do sacrefyce to the fend and forsake gods sacrefyce and take the fend to
there lord and make him their god. And so the fend has power over them / not
they over the fend.

Caplm.xxxiiij.
ANd therefore says the law.xxvi. q^.vij. Non obseruetis. That all such
wytches and all that axe any counseyll or help of them / or set any faith in
them / or bring them in their houses / or go to their houses to have help or
counsel of them / and all that take heed of dysmale days / or use nyce
obseruau^ces in the new moan / or in the new year as setting of mete or of
drink by night on the benche / for to feed. All hold / or gobelyn. Ledynge of
the ploughe about the fire as for good beginning of the year that they should
fare the better all the year folowyn ge / or take heed to the Iudycyall of
astronomye / or to dyuynacyons / by chyterynge of birds / or by fleing of
fowls / or assente to any such nyce obseruaunces / or to dyuyne a man's life
or death by nombres and by the spear of Pictagoras / or to make any dyuynynge
thereby / or by songuary or sompnarye / the book of dremes / or by the book
that is called the appostles lottes / or use any charms in gaderynge of herbs
/ or in hanging of scrowes about man or woman or child or be for any
sickness with any scripture or fygures and caractes / but if it be Pater
noster. Aue or the Creed / or any holy words of the gospel / or of holy write
for devotion not for curyousyte / and oonly with the token of the holy cross /
and all that vsen any manner wytchecrafte or any mysbyleue y^ all such forsaken
the faith of holy church and their crystendome / and become gods enemies and
dys please god full grievously / and fall in to dampnacyon withouten end / but
they amend them the sooner. And therefore the law commands that bysshopes
should be besye to destroy all manner wytchecraftes. And if they fond any man
or woman that gaaf them to wytche craft but they would amend them / they
should chase them out of their bysshoryke with open despyte.xxvi. q^. v.
episcopi. And in the same place the law says that tho wymmen y^ which wene
by night to ride on diverse bestes and pass diverse lands and contrees and
follow a glorious queen the which is called Dyana / or else Herodyana or any
other name / and wene that they ben in their service bodily with much myrthe /
such wymen ben all dysceyued and blinded with the fend whom they serve. And
therefore the fend has power for to disceyue them And that they suffer only by
fantasy by dreme / and by Iapery of the fend. They wene it were so bodily and
in deed and it is not so. And all tho that say or believe that men or wymen
might by wytchecrafte be turned in to bestes or in to likeness of bestes or
birds bodily ben worse than any paynym. And they that for hate or wrath that
they bear against any man or woman take away the clothes of the aultre and
clothe ye aultre with doleful clothing / or besette the aultre or the cross
about with thorns / and withdraw light out of the church / or sing or do
sing mass of Requiem for them that been alive in hope that they should fare
the worse and the sooner deye the priest should be degraded / and both the
priest and he that stered him thereto for to do it should be exyled for ever.
And all manner wytches and all that by leave on wytchecraft should be acursed
solempnely / but they would amend them / as the law says in the same place /
and in the next chapter following et ca^. Si quis. As the law says there
ca^. Contra. If the wytches were bound men and wymen / they should be beten
hard and sore. If they were free they shlod be punysshed in hard prison. And
by the law Imperyall vt ca^. de maleticijs nullus. et l. nemo et l. culpa. And
by the law Canon xxvi. q^.v. qui diuinaciones in glosa. Such wytches should
be heded and burnt and their faytours exyled / and all their goods forteteth.
And by the law of holy church all that believe in them or mayntene them
should do five year penance.xxvi. q^.v. Non liceat. et ca^. Qui diuinaco^es.
Also it is forboden by the law as wytchecrafte for to do things come again /
by scripture in book or in tables or by astrola bye. ext. li. v. ti.xxvi. ca^.
i. et. n^ Dives. I hold it a full good deed to take a thief with his theft by
what craft y^ a man may for salvation of the people / and to punysshe or slay
a thief by the law for ensample of other.

Caplm.xxxv.
PAuper. It is not lefull to any man for to slay a thief against the kings law
and without process of the lands law and without auctoryte of his lyege
lord / ne without a lawful Judge ordained of his lyege lord / and yet is the
thief worthy to deye. Dives. That is sothe. For if every man might slay a thief
at his own will and by his own dome / men should vnd color of theft slay
many a true man for wrath couetyse and hate. Pauper Sythen men do so much
reverence to the kings laws and the lands laws to flee myschyues that
should fall but if the laws were kept. Much more reucrence should they do
to gods law and holy church law / and eschew for to forfete there against /
sythen gods laws and holy church laws ben so reasonable and as good as the
kings laws of England. Nevertheless the kings laws if they be Just they
be gods laws. And as many perils and moo should fall if men took thieves
by wytchecrafte against gods laws and holy church laws / as if they slew
them against the kings laws and the lands laws. Dives. Show me that.
Pauper. If a man slay a thief not him defendaunt against the kings law / he
forfeteth against his king and is worthy death. And if he make him a Justice by
his own auctoryte / though he keep other process of the law he is a traitor
to his king. And as much and more forfeteth he against the king of heaven that
takes a thief with wytchecraft against gods laws / sythen god and holy
church has forboden it / as does he that sleeth a thief against the kings
laws. And sythen he makes the devil and the wytches that been most gods
enemies his Judge and werketh by their domes in the desspyte of god y^ has
forboden it hem / he is a full high traitor to god. And so he does ten fold
more sin / and therefore he is worthy to be hanged more than a thief. More over
in as much as the fend is a liar always ready to lie and with lesynges
dysceyueth mankind / and brings men to murdre and to shedyng of blood / and
rather for to slay Innocents than for to slay thieves. If such wytchecraftes
were used / many Innocents and many a good man and woman should be taken and
slain / and thieves should go free. For the fend is more favorable to thieves
/ manquellers / lecherous and to all other sinful wretches than he is to any
good man or good woman and he has more liking for to slay a good man or good
woman than to slay a thief. Also god says in the gospel that the fend has
ever ben a liar / and stood never in trenthe / and that he is a manqueller /
and fader of liars and of lesynges. And therefore all thoo that give faith to his
tales and do thereafter as much as is in them / they make god false and
forsake their god that is sovereign treu the / and take them to the devil /
that is sovereign falshode / and so they worship the fend and despise god.
And if such crafts were suffered every man might accuse other of what sin
that he would / and say that the fend or the wytches told it him. And in
this manner every man might kylle and slay other. And therefore for these skylles
and reasons and many moo and for to flee these perils and many other / god
has forboden all manner of wytchecrafte / for it is not done withouten help of
the fend. But now a days god of his great mercy suffers not the fend but
full seldom for to say sothe / for if he suffered him for to say sothe /
English people should forsake god all attones and set their trust and
their faith all in the fend. For notwithstanding that they find the fendes
tales and all his crafts full false / by great and often experyence / and
spend full great therabout / and lesen all that they done and myshappen / yet
will they not leave nor cease for no loss / for no prechynge / for no shame /
neither for no punysshyng Nevertheless it is no great wonder / for the fend
holds them full hard bound in his bounds as his churles and his thralles.
For all such done a passing homage sacrefyce and service to the fend and
forsaken god as I said first.

Caplm.xxxvi.
Dives. Such crafts and co^mracyons with holy prayers and they that done them
ben holden for full good lyuers / and they give them to fasting / to penance
dooynge / and bedes bidding / and to many other good deeds. And therefore men
give the more faith and credence to them and believe them the better. For it is
not semely that the fendes craft should be done with such holiness. Pauper.
The more holy thing and the more holy prayer that man or woman used in the
fendes service / the more worshypp and the more pleasaunce they do to the
fend / and the more despyte and offense do they to god. For the worship and
the prayers and the service that they should do to god / they do it to the
fend. And things that been ordained oonly for gods service / they spend it
in the deuylles service. And therefore they that use holy words of the gospel.
Pater noster. Aue. or Creed / or holy prayers in their wytchecraftes / for
charms or comuracy^ns / and all they that use holy water of the font / holy
crysme / masses singing / fastings / contynence / wullen goeynge / and such
other in their wytchecrafte they make a full high sacrefyce to the fend. It
has often ben known y^ wytches with saying of their Pater noster / and
droppynge of the holy candell in a man's steps that they hated has done his
feet roten of. Dives. What should the Pater noster / and the holy candell do
thereto. Pauper. Right naught. But for the wytche worshyppeth the send so
hyghely with the holy prayers / and with the holy candell / and used such holy
things in his service in despyte of god. Therefore is the fend ready to do the
wytches will / and to fulfill things that they done it for / and so it
stands only in the devil and in mysbyleue of the wytche and not in the Pater
noster / ne in the holy candell / and yet the fools mean otherwise. For the
fend would not do their will but they do him such high sacrefyce. For when
that they light the candell and say their Pater noster / to that intent /
they do it not to god / but to the fend. And in that they forsake god and
worshypp the fend as god / and claim the fend to their fader / saying to him
that they ought to say only to god / as Pater noster qui es in celis and^.
Our fader that art in heuens hallowed be thy name. And all that follows they
say it to the fend And therefore y^ fend may clay me hem for his childern /
and god may resonably forsake them and say to them that he said to the Jews.
Vos facitis opera patris vestri. vos ex patre dyabolo estis. et desideria
patris vestri vultis facere. Io.viij. Ye done says he the works of the fend
your fader / ye ben of the fader the devil / and the desires of your fader ye
will do And in the same manner their chasty te / their fasting / their
penance doing is in as much as they do it to please the fend and for a
wicked end it is a service and a sacrefyce to the fend. And full few men or
wymen will do so much penance for the love of god / as the wytches do for the
love of the fend and to please the fend / in so much that sometime they
cut them self with knyues and prycke them self with launcettes / and so
offer their flesh and their blood in sacrefyce to y^ fend / as we find in
the third book of kings the.xviij. chapter. And therefore believe friends
sythen this manner of sin is so grievous so hydeous and so abhomynable in
gods sight / suffer it never to be do by none of your household / for no
loss ne no theft / for no sickness / for no health / for no welthe / for no
woe. For if ye do it your self / or do it to be done / or assente to the doing
/ or suffer it to be done when ye might let it ye be acursed and offend your
god full hyghely and full grievously. For all they that do it or assente to the
doing / and set their faith therein / they forfete against the first
commandment full grievously. For in that they forsake god / and make the fend
their god / and worshyppeh him as god. And by what thing y^ they do their
wytchecrafte / be it fire / be it air / or water / or earth / or deed bones /
or any other thing that is in their mawme try / and that they make symylytude
to god as much as in them is and worship it as god. And therefore god forbode
in the first commandment that man shode not make him likeness y^ is in
heaven / that is to say / neither in the fyrmament / ne in the fire / ne in the
air. And so in that word he forbedeth the Iudycyall astronomye / and
pyromancye / that is wytchecrafte done in the fire / and aeromancye / that is
wytchecrafte done in the air. Also he forbedeth men to make them likeness of
any thing that is in earth. In that he forbedeth geomancy that is wytchecrafte
done in the earth And also nygromancye / that is wytchecrafte done by deed
bodies that been but earth / and buried in the earth. Also he forbedeth men to
make them symylytude of any thing that is in the water under the earth. In
which words he forbedeth ydrom a^cye / that is wytchecrafte done in the
water. He badde that men should worship none such things as god / ne set
their trust ne their faith therein. For if they do they make such things
like god in as much as in them is. And not only they make such things like
god in this manner / but also they make the fendes like god / which dwell some
in the fire / some in the air / some in the water / and some in the earth for
to tempte mankind / and ben besy night and day for to lose man's soul and
womannes. Dives. Show me some example of this manner of wytchecraftes. Pauper.
I am besy for to destroy wytchecrafte and not for to teache it. But would god
that no man ne no woman wyste what it is / neither knew these ne none other /
for there ben all to many yt know these / and many mo thereto / and practyse
new year by year at the fendes techynge / tylle much of this land is blente
and shente with such folly. For over much wytchecrafte reygneth openly / but
much more pryuely / and namely among these old men and wymmen / the which
for their age would feign be holden wise. And than begin they most to dote and
to teache their younger many folyes and many nyce fantasyes that been very
wytchecraftes. And therefore both old and young should axe counsel of wise
men of holy church / and wit if such things and doings as they teache be
lefull or not lefull.

Dives. By common sawes of clerks god in the first commandment forbedeth
three pryncypall sins. Pride y^ is understand by the likeness above in heaven
for there it began. And y^ proud man and woman would always be above and
worlhyp his pride as god. For y^ proud man and woman will have forth their
proud wylles will god or not. And therefore Job says y^ the proud fend is
king of all childern of pride And as saint Paul says / proud Antecryste
shall have him as god and sytt in gods Temple as if he were god Also they say
y^ god forbade there the sin of couetyse / that is understand by the
likeness in earth / for myscouetyse stands most in erthly thing. And
therefore saint Poule says / that auaryce is seruage of mawmettes of ydolatrye.
For as saint Ierom says The auaryce man makes his money and his richesses
his god. Also they say y^ by the same commandment he forbade lecherye and
glotonye / which ben understand by y^ likeness in the water under the earth.
For as saint Poule says. Lechoures and glotones make their womb and their
body their god. For their most trauayll and business is to please and serve
their womb and their belly. Pauper. In as much as every sin is ayenste the
worship of god / in so much as god in the first commandment forbedeth all
manner sin in generale. But as I said by the first commandment / he forbade
in specyaall mawmetrye / ydolatrye / wytchecrafte / sorcerye. For afterward he
gave the four commandment specially against pride and vnbuxomnesse / and the
sixte and the tenthe against lecherye / the seuenthe and the nynthe against
auaryce and couetyse.

Dives. It is lefull to use lottes. Pauper. Sometime to break strife in partynge
and gyuynge of thing that may not well be departed. Or when y^ men ben in
doubt what is to do and man's wit fails / than is it lefull to use lottes
in things that is not against the worship of god / so that it be done with the
reverence of god and holy prayer by fore as the apostles did in chesynge of
saint Mathie the apostle / and Elyazar in chesynge of a wife to Ysaac Abraha^s
sone Gen^.xxiiij And therefore Solomon says prouer.xvi. y^ lot^ ben put in preuy
places / and god tempreth them as he will. But to use lott^ with out need and
only for vanyte / or for dyuynacyon / setting faith therein to wit thereby what
shall fall / it is unlawful and repreued of god and holy church / and if men
set trust and faith there in it is a grievous sy^ne. Dives. Playeng at the
dyce stands in lotte and adventure of the dyce / and yet the game is lefull.
Pauper. To use that game for recreacyon and only for play it may be suffered /
so that it be done in manner honestly / and in place and time co^uenyent / and
not to much in sesyng of time. But for to use it for to win thereby / and put
things in adventure of dyce / it is a full great sin and evil gotten good
that men get therewith. And therefore by the law if it were a man of holy
church that used such play he should be pryued of his benefyce if that he
had any. And if he had no benefyce he should be unabled and dysposed thereto
but if he would cease. And if it were a lewd man / he should be acursed.

therefore says the law / that no man of holy church should be at such
games.

Caplm.xxxix.
Dives. Sythen there be so maay manners of wytchecraftes y^ they may not be told
in special. I pray the tell me in general what is wytchecraft. Pauper.
Every craft that man or woman uses to know any thing or to do any thing that
he may not know ne do by the way of reason ne by the werkyng of kind is
wytchecrafte. And though it be do by way of kind / and they use thereto any
charms or nyce obseruau^ces in the doing / wenynge that it might not be done
without that charm / and such obseruaunce or else such charms oonly to
blind the people that they should trust in him for his charms and not in
werkyng of kind / it is wytchecrafte all if he say only his Pater noster / in
the doing for to be holden a charmer / and to do y^ people trust in him
pryncypally for charms / all though he says no charms but werketh only by
kind / yet he is a wytche and his doing is wytche craft. For by such doing
he blyndeth the people and dysceyued them / and does them trust in
wytchecrafte and so do worship to the fend and despyte to god. And what so
ever man or woman do by way of kind and reason / if he use any craft of
Iapery and faytrye for to blind the people / for to do them believe that he
were a wytche and that he did it not by way of kind / but by charms and
sorcery / he is a wytche in gods sight / and his doing is wytchecrafte. For
his craft is to make men worship the fend / in as much as he does the
people trust in wytchecrafte / and so spend their good in the fendes service
/ and to seek help of the fend and forsake gods help. And has lever him
self for to be holden a wytche and the deuylles servant / than for to be
holden gods servant / and lever for to take men's good in worshyppynge of
the fend than in worshyppyng of god. And by the conning and grace that god
has given him and by the might and virtue that god has given to things of
kind for help of man's kind / falsely he enhaunceth the fendes craft in
destruccyon of mankind. Dives.

Tell some example. Pauper. To hele man's wounds while they be fresshe and
clean / black wulle and oil ben full medycynable without any charm as
experyence shows well. But for as much as men wene that it were naught
worth without the charm / and set their faith pryncypally in the charm /
therefore it is to them a wytche craft. But though a man in the doing say his
pater noster / or some holy prayer calling the grace of god in his doing it
is no wytche craft but it is well done.

Caplm.xl.
Dives. What if he say pater noster / or other holy words / or some holy
prayer pryuely or aperte for to do the people wene yt it is do by way of
miracle and for his prayer ^ his holiness / when he does it by reason and
werkyng of kind. Pauper. Than is it a full great ypocresye and a full grievous
sin in him that does it in that manner and for that intend / but wytche
craft is it none / for it is no worship to the fendes craft / ne the people
is not styred thereby to trust in the fend but rather in god. Dives. Is it any
wytche craft to charm adders or other bestes and birds with holy words or
holy write or with any other holy words Pauper. If a man or woman take heed in
his doing only to the holy words and to the might of god / it is no wytche
craft. But if they use in their dooynge any mysobseruau^ce and set more
trust therein than in holy words or in god / than as clerks say it is wytche
craft^ / and the effect thereof if it fall it comes of the fend / and namely
in adders and serpents. For the adder was the first Instrumente that the
fend used for to dysceyue mankind / as we find Genesis.iij. And yet by the
adder he does men most trust in wytche craft. Dives. Is it any p^ryll to
man or woman to charge his friend in his deyeng to come again and teile hy^ how
he fares. Pauper. It is a full great peril. For as saint Poule says The fend
oftyme makes him like an angel of light / but he may not last in the beauty
ne bryghtnes. And so lightly the fend might appear to him that were alive in
the likeness of him that were deed and tell him lesynges / and in case make
him so afered that he should lose his wit and fall in wanbyleue as it fell
to one within a few years. And happily he should tell him that he were
dampened though it were not so / or tell him that he were in bliss though he
were in bitter pain / and so let him of his almesdede and from his holy
prayers and other good deeds by which not only that soul should be helped /
but many other with him. Also if he appeared to him / or if he wend that he
appeared to him he should have the less mede for his believe than he had
before / for than were he techeth by experyence to know that the soul lives
after the body. Also it is not in the souls power to appear to man or woman
after the death of his body / ne man is not able to see a soul / for it is
Inuysyble without a special miracle of god. And so both he that charge him
to come again / and he that behoteth to come again tempten god. And right as god
will that every man and woman be uncertain what time he shall deye / for that
he should always be dredeful to do amys and besy to do well. Right so he will
that men be uncertain of their friends when they ben deed in what state that
they ben / for that they should always be besy to help their souls with
masses singing alms doing with bedes bidding / and other good deeds / not
oonly for help of him but of other that have lytyl help or none Also for
encresyng of their own mede. For who so that trauaylleth well for an other /
trauaylleth best for him self. For as saint Poule says. There shall no good
deed be unrewarded / ne no wicked deed be vnpunysshid. Dives. Thy reason is
good. For if men wyste that their friends were out of pain they would do right
naught for them / and so they should lose much mede for that knowing / and
souls lose much help. And if men wyste for certain when they should deye /
they should be to bold to do amys in hope that they should amend them in
their deynge. But yet notwithstanding al thy reasons / some clerks sayen that
it is lefull to men for to charge their friends to come aren to show them her
state after their death. For as they say it is kyndely thing for to desire for
to know or to conne. For the phylosophre says that every man and woman by
way of kind desires to know and to conne. Omnes homines natura scire
desiderant. Pauper. They say sothe / and not against me. For it is lefull to
every man and woman for to desire to conne and to know. But it is not lefull
for to desire to know in that manner / ne by no mean unlawful not by techynge
of the fend / neither by techynge of them that been deed.

Caplm.xli.
Dives. How is it that spyrytes walk so about when men be deed. Pauper.
Commonly such spyrytes ben fendes and goo so about to sclaundre them that been
deed / and for to bring the people in to error and bachytynge and wicked
demynge / that if the people demed evil and spoke evil of them before their
death / to do them speak and deem much worse after their death / and so to
bring the people full deep in sin. And sometime they gone in to the bodies of
them yt ben deed and buried and bear it about to do them vylony. But when
spyrytes goo in this manner / they do much harm and mothe disease. Nathelesse
by the leave of god the souls appear in what manner god will to hem that been
alive / some for to have help / sometime to show that the souls live after
the body to conferme them that been feeble in the faith and believe not saddly
that man's soul lived not after his death / but such spyrytes do no harm but
to tho that will not believe them that they have such pain / or will not
redely help hem at their axinge.

Caplm.xlij.
Dives. Is it lefull to trust in these fastings new found to flee sudden
death. Pauper. It is a great folly to trust therein For as I said now late / god
will that man and woman be uncertain what time that they should deye and in
what manner. For god will that man and woman be always besye to flee sin and
for to do well for dread of death / and always ready what time that god will send
after them. And if that men were certain by such fasting that they should
not deye suddenly / but have time of repentance / and to be shreuen and
houseled / they should be the more rechelesse in their living / and they
should the less care for to do amys in hope of amendment in their dyeng.
And therefore god grau^teth them not the end nor the effect that they fast
for. For greter sudden death wyste I never than that men had than. I wyste
them have that have fasted such fastes.vij. years about / ne more dyspytefull
and shame full in open punysshyng of their sin / and there was never so much
sudden death so long reygnyng in this land as has be sythen such fasting
began / we may not treaten god ne put him to no laws. And therefore we should
put always our life and our death only in his will / prayeng to him of his
grace that he will ordeyn for us both in life and death / as it is most to his
worship and help of our soul. It is well done for to pray to god with
fasting and good deeds that he save us from sudden death / for all holy church
prays so. But for to set says in such nyce obseruau^ces and wene to be
syker of their asking for such obseruaunces that is not lefull / for we may
not know the will of god in such things with out a special reuelacyon of god
/ we may pray and ought to pray / but god shall grant as him lyketh / and
as he sees that it is most spedefull to us and most to his worshypp. And
therefore Solomon says. Nemo sit vtru^ amore an odio dignus sit. Eccle. ix. No
man he says wot sykerly whether he is worthy hate or love. And yet we hope
and ought all to hope that god will love us and save us if we do our devour.
Fasting is good if it be done in mesure and manner and in good intencyon / so
that men set no mysbyleue therein / ne ground them in no lesynges ne in no
nyce obseruau^ces. But in as much as they prefer in their fasting days of
their own choice before tho days that been ordained by holy church to fast /
in so much they sin in presumpcyon and do prejudice to holy church yt
ordained such days that been most conuenyente to fast / as wednesdaye
frydaye and satyrdaye. De conse. distinct.iij. Ieiunia and^. sabbato. Dives. I
see no ground ne reason in such fasting / ne why it should be more medefull
to fast all mondayes in the year when the feste of our Lady in lent falls
on the mondaye / than for to fast in worship of her ye wednesdaye frydaye or
satyrdaye. For I believe sykerly yt the mede of fasting or the virtue of
fasting is not assygned ne lymyted by the lettres of the calendar ne follow
not the course of the calendar / ne changes not from one day to another day
/ all if the lettres change from one day to an other. And so as me thinks
such fasting is grounded in some lesyng and faynyng and in some mysbyleue full
nygh wytchecrafte. Pauper. Me thinks the same For all if the feste fall
sometime on the mondaye / sometime on ye tuesday yet the deed in it self fell
neither on the mondaye ne on ye tuesdaye / but it fell on the frydaye / for
than ye angel greted our lady and than she conceived gods sone lord of
bliss. And.xxxiij. year after the same time and the same day / that is to
say on good frydaye about myddaye she saw her dear sone deynge for mankind
upon the rode tree. And so me thinks yt it is more pleasant to god and to
our lady and more conuenyent to fast the frydaye in the worship of christ that
deyed for us all that day / and also in worship of our lady that conceived
that day her dear sone at the gretynge of the angel than to fast either
mondaye or tuesdaye. And in as much as they wene that such fast should not
auayll them to the end yt they fast it fore / but if they change their fast
year by year after the course of the calendar / and that must be do.vij. year
during after other / it is a nyce fantasye and mysbyleue full nyghe
wytchecrafte. For Christ might grau^ them that boon as well for five or for.vi.
or for.viij. year fasting as for.vij. year fasting. I fond never ground
whereof it came neither reason ne auctoryte find I none. Axe forth if thou will
somewhat else.

Dives. Is it lefull to set any trust or any faith on dremes. Pauper. There
ben two manner causes of dremes. One from inward / and an other from outward.
Causes of dremes from inward ben three manner. One is common sterynge of man's
fantasye or woman's in their sleep / and such dremes ben but fantasyes and
vanytees And therefore says Solomon. Vbi multa somnia. ibi multe vanitates.
Eccle. v. Where as ben many dremes there ben many vanytees / for in this manner
one man shall have moo dremes than some twenty other Another cause from inward
is ye dysposyco^n of the body. For when men ben cold of kind / they dreme of
frostes and snow / and so by their dremes a wise leche may know in part the
dysposyco^n of there body / be it to health or to sekenes. The third cause
from inward is the dysposyco^n of ye soul For commonly men dremen of such
things as there souls and their thought is most in occupied while yt they
waken / either by study / by love / or by hate / by wrath / by dread / by
sorrow / by care pride or couetyse. Causes of dremes from outward ben two
manner / bodily and ghoostly. Bodily is the dysposyco^n of the air and of the
place about him / and other things beside him. And therefore in rain weder men
dreme of water and of fysshes / for often man's body chau^geth after the
dysposycyon of the air and of his abiding place And for these three causes
says the phylosophre De somno et vigilia. That leches should take bid to the
dremes of them that been seek to know thereby how they ben dysposed. Ghoostly
causes from outward of dremes ben ij. manners / the one is good / for that is
god by him self / or else by angellys / and that in three manners. For some
dreme so by ymagynacyon only / as did the king Pharao and Nabugodonosor. Some
dreme only by understanding / as did saint Poule and Balaam. Some dreme both
by ymagynaco^n and by understanding / as did saint Johan in apocalypse and
Danyell in his prophecye / which saw wonderful syghtes by ymagynaco^n and
understanding what tho syghtes betokened. But Pharao and Nabugodonosor
understand not the vysyons ne the dremes that they had. The other cause of
dremes from outward is not good as when it falls by Illusyon of the fend /
for tho pryncypally serve to wytche craft. Sometime dremes come of great
business and trauayl that one has when he is wakyng And therefore says Solomon
/ that after business folowen many dremes / for commonly men dreme of such
things as they ben in occupied while they wake. Sometime dremes come of to
much abstynance and of hongre. Sometime it comes of excess of mete or of
drink. Sometime of myslykynge that man has when he is wakyng. And in as much
as the effect of things is token of his causes / as smoke is token of the
fire / so such dremes ben tokens of causes yt they come of. And in this manner
awyse man may tell by dremes causes of man's dremes / and so by causes tell
other preuy things that may fall thereof. For oftyme one cause brings forth
diverse effects each after other. Dives. Tell some examples. Pauper.
Experyence shows that if a man talk much with a woman and set his heart
gretely to her by day / and in the night following he dremeth of her some nyce
dreme / by which dreme if he told it to some wise man / he would say that he
loved much that woman / and but he withdrewe him from her company / it should
turn him to felony And also as clerks say in asmoche as dremes come by way
of kind / in so much it is lefull to tell what they sygnefye after the
causes yt they come of / so that in their telling and castyng they pass not
the bounds of kind. Also it is lefull to tell things that been to come / by
dremes that come by reuelaco^n of god / if man and woman have y^ grace to
understand them as Joseph and Danyell had But for as much as dremes comen
in so diverse manners / certain it is full hard to know in what manner they
come / whether by god or by kind or by y^ fend or by any other way Therefore
it is full peryllous to set any faith therein / as saint Gregorye says
li.viij. morx. super illud Job. Terrebis me per sompnia. For sometime by dremes
the fend behoteth men great prosperyte and much richesses to bring them in
pride and hope of things that they should never have. Sometime by dremes he
pretends much aduersyte and great disease for to bring folk in sorrow and
dread and great heaviness / and if he may to bring them in to dyspayre / for
nyce fantasyes that he brings them in. And sometime for men set faith in
such dremes / god suffers such myschyues to fall to them as their dremes
pretend in punysshynge of their sin / for that they set in dremes against
the law of god. But prosperyte falls them none for no such dremyng. Dives
Where fyndest you that god forbedth men to set faith in dremes.

Caplm.xliiij.
Pauper. Leuitici.xix. where as god says thus. Non auguria bimini. nec
obseruabit sompnia. Ye shall not dyuyne ne make you wise of preuy things by no
wit checrafte / and ye shall wait after no dremes ne take heed thereto / ne
set faith therein. Also Deuteronomy0.xviij. God forbedeth all manner wytchecraftes and
charms / and byddeth that no man should take heed to dremes. And in the same
book.xiij. god says thus If be so says he that any man among you begins
to be a soche sayer and a prophet / and say that he had a dreme and a vysyon
and tell any wonder / which wonder and token falls as he says / if he
styre the to mawmetrye or to any wytchecrafte / here not the words of that
prophet and of that dremer. For by him god assayeth you / that it may be
openly known whether ye love him with all your heart and soul or nay. And
therefore god byddeth that such dremers and prophets should be slain and
though he were thyn own brother by fader and by mother you sholdest not spare
him in that caas. And therefore Solomon says / that dremes have also brought
much people in error and in folly / and they that trust therein fall to
naught. Eccle.xxxiiij. For all if dremes come oftymes by way of kind as I
said / yet it is full hard to know when it comes by way of kind or by
Illusyon of the fend. And though they come by way of kind and though a man
know the causes in kind of dremes / yet it is full hard to tell certaynely
what yt fall thereof / for only god knows for certain things that been to
come / and he may change and let the werkynge of kind. And also though men
know the causes of kind that dremes come of / yet know they not what
lettynges ben on other byhalfe by way of kind. Dives. Tell some example.
Pauper. When smoke meddled with fire comes out of an house by the wyndowe or by
the louerys / men that seen it from far will say that that house shall go on
fire. And yet there may be so good help nyghe for to quench the fire that yt
house shall take but little harm. And many a man by way of kind is dysposed
to diverse sickness / but yet he may so govern him and use such medecynes
that he shall let that dysposyco^n of kind and not have such sekekesses.
Dives. By the same reason though a dreme come of gods sendynge to help of
man's souls and in warning of myschyef to come / he should take none head
thereto / ne set ne faith therein / for he wot not fro whens it comes.
Pauper. Without reuelaco^n of god he wot not fro whens it comes. And therefore
when god sends such dremes / he shall show to him that thus dremeth / or to
some other from whens it comes / and what it betokens. As he did to the
king Pharao by Joseph / and to the king Nabugodonosor by Danyell.

Caplm.xlv.
Dives. If man or woman have a dreme that styreth them to good works and to
virtue and to flee sin and to amend his life / may he not set his faith
therein / and do thereafter. Pauper. Whether it comes of god or of the fend /
it is leful to him for to set his faith therein and to do thereafter. For it
styreth him to things that he is bounden to without any dreme And oftymes
both fend and the fendes lymmes teache well though they do full evil. But a
man so dremynge must be full well ware / that for such dremes he take none
head to other dremes that styre him to vanyte or to curyosyte for to know
things that be to come / or other preuy things / or to mysdeme of his even
christian / or to hate / or to mysloue / or to mayte after great prosperyte / or
to dread great aduersyte / or death of friends / or loss of catell / and of
such other. But in as much as they styre them to god and to goodness / he
may follow his dremes and do after them wisely and warly for often the fend
under color of holiness desceyueth both man and woman. Dives. Much people
had lever for to dreme of the fend than of god or of his mother Marye / for
as they say, when they dreme of the fend they fare well in the day following
/ but when they dreme of god or of our lady they fare evil afterward. Pauper.
Such people fare the worse for their mysbyleue and their nyce fantasye and
sin full grievously / and be full evil dysceyued by the gyle of the fend.
For when the fend sees that a man shall have disease / he makes him in the
night before to dreme of god and of our lady and of other saints / or of men
of relygyon and so to make him to have less deuoco^n to god and our lady and
other saints / and less affecco^n to men of relygyon because of his disease
that shall fall to hy^ after yt dreme. And so by the bodily disease that he
thinks for to bring in him / he trauaylleth to bring him in to ghoostly
disease and in deep sin. And therefore when men will be foles and set their
faith to such dremes that come so by gyle of the fend for as much as disease
falls to them ones or t^^es after such dremes. Therefore god suffers the
fend in punysshynge of their sin and of their mysbyleue for to do them
dreme often of such manner / and after to do them disease as they believe to
have. And therefore when men had such dremes with disease so following and
began to have any fantasy or faith therein / they should shryue them thereof to
some wise man and tell him the fendes gyle and they should fare the better.
Some dreme of god and of our lady and of holy men that have faren full well
afterward / for they have no such fantasye ne mysbyleue in dremes. And some
faren full evil after for their mysbyleue / and oftymes they faren full evil
when they dreme neither of god ne of our lady.

IN the same manner. Some man had lever for to mete with a froude or a frogge
in the way than to mete with a knight or a squyre / or with any man of
relygyon or of holy church / for than they say and believe that they shall
have gold. For sometime after the metynge of a frogge or a tode / they have
resceyued gold / and so they fall in mysbyleue and despysen their even
christian. For I wot well that they resceyue gold of men or of wymen / but not
of frogs ne of todes / but it be of the devil in likeness of a frogge or a
tode. And they mete with many a foul frogge and tode in the year and yet
resceyue they no gold for that metynge. And if they resceyued any gold / they
should thank god and their even christian / not the frogge ne the tode for they
may naught give them. And these laborers deluers and dykers that most mete
with frogs and todes ben full poor commonly. And but men pay them their hyre
they have lytyl or naught. Also in this manner some believe that if the kyte or
the puttoke flee over the way before them / that they should fare well that
day / for sometime they have faren well after that they see the kyte so fleing
/ and so they fall in wanbyleue and thank the kyte of their well fare and not
god. But such foles take none head how often men mete with the kyte so fleing
/ and yet they fare never the better. For there is no folk that mete so often
with y^ kyte so fleing as they that beg their mete fro door to door

Dives. What say thou of them that dyuyne by the first day of the year /
that is the first kalendas of Ianuarye / and by the Crystmasse day what yt
shall fall in the year following. That if it fall on the sunday / the winter
following shall be good / and the somer good and dry / and plente of wine.
Oxen and sheep shall well wexe and multyplye. Old men and old wymmen shall
deye / and peace and accord shall be made that year also. Pauper. I say that
it is open to lie and wytchecrafte / and full high offense to the mageste of
god. For he that made all thing and rules all thing is not bounden ne arted
to the course ne law of the calendar. He needs no calendar in his governance
But he governs and demeth this world by treuthe and equity meddled with mercy
/ and after that men deserve he sends them woe and welthe / peace or war what
day that ever y^ kalendas of Ianuarye or Crystmasse day fall on. In the year
of our lord a thousand and four hundred the kalendas of Ianuarye selle on y^
thursdaye when as they say should fall plente of all good and peace also but
that year following great hongre great pestylence / sudden death / war fell
within the land and war without / dread sorrow and care / and trybulacyon in
every degree. The kalendas has changes sythen from day to day / and the
year is come aren on the thursdaye / but our disease changes not but always
in to worse for our sins. For our sins always increases and lesseth not.
And in what day that so ever the kalendas of Ianuarye and Crystmasse day
falls in one land / the same day it falls all about / and yet follows it
not thereof that it should be over all peace if it fall on the thursdaye or the
sunday / ne over all plente / ne over all war / and hongre or pestylence /
if it fell on the satyrdaye. Dives. Some dyuyne by the thondrynge and make
them wise of all the year coming after the month that it thondreth in.
Pauper That also is a great folly and open wytchecrafte / for it is a kyndly
thing in somer time to thondre in May Apryll. Iuyn. July. August and
Septembre. But in other months that been in winter is it not so kyndely to
thondre as than. For when great tho^dre in winter falls it is against kind
and token of the great offense to god and token of vengeance coming / but if
men amend them. And so is every thing / and namely wederynge that falls
against common course of kind. But for to dyuyne thereby in a special what ye
shall fall either well either woe / peace or war / hongre or plente / health or
sickness / it is unlawful For oonly goo knows for certain what is to come of
such things / and where and when it shall fall. And god uses not y^ thondre
as an horn to blow his counsel about the world.

Caplm.xlviij.
Dives. It is a common opinion among the gentyles and other also / that all the
year follows the dysposycyon of the.xij. days in Crystmasse. So that the
first month shall be such in wedrynge as the first day of the.xij. days
is / the second month as the second day is / and so forth all following.
Pauper. That opinion is false and open folly. For it is a full kyndely thing
to have froste and snow all the.xij. days. But it were aye^ste kind to have
froste and snow all the year following. And sometime it falls that it is full
raynye weder all the xij. days / but it follows not thereof that it should
rain and be wete weder all the year after. It is a full kyndely thing that the
son show hy^ not three days or four togydre in crystmasse / but it were
much against kind if the son showed him not three months or four togydre
namely in the somer time. And often it falls that in all the.xij. days it
rayneth no rain / but every day son shine and full fair weder / but it
follows not thereof that it should be son shine without rain all the year
after / for than be and man should be in great peril. At the beginning of
the world the fend behyght Adam and Eve that they should be as god knowing
good and evil that was to come / if they would ete of the tree against gods
commandment / and so he brought them in to care and sorrow and in to her
folly. And in the same manner these days he behoteth men to be as god /
knowing well and woe that is to come / by such nyce fantasyes that he techeth
them tylle that he brings them in woe / and namely English nacyon that most
takes head to his lore / and most takes head to wytchecrafte and to them
that make them prophets and make them wise in such folyes against the law of
god.

Dives. It is not lefull to them that it can for to make metal gold or
silver / and to multeplye gold and silver from.xx. pound to.xl. pound / and
so forth. Pauper. If any man could do it by way of kind it were lefull / and
full prouffytable to this land. But I know well that there is noman that can
do it. For if they could they would first multeplye to their own self
prouffyte and make them self rich And commonly all them that use that craft
but if they have somewhat ellis for to take to / ben full poor and full nedy.
But when that they can or may begyle any man of his good as they done full often
and run away with other men's goods / and of the rich men make full poor
men. They behoten them multeplycacyon / but they play all with subtraccyon
and bring people in to great pouerte. Little neded our king for to charge the
people with taxes and talyages / if that he had such folk in his Real me
that could do that craft to make gold and silver and so to multeplye it. But
such Iapers and faytours destroyen much gold and silver in destruccyon of
the Realm / and blind many a wise man and begyle them of their good. For the
couetouse and the false accord soon togydre. And for asmoche as when men have
enough and ben not content therewith / therefore god suffreeh them to be begyled
/ and so for to be mocked for couetyse that they can not cesse till they be
brought to naught or to over great loss / for many a man has be undone by
this craft. And therefore this craft is condemned and forfended as
wytchecraft by the law.xxvi.q^.v. Ep^us.

Dives. What sayste thou of them that will have no men of holy church / and
namely men of relygyon with them on hunting / for their believe is also that
they should speed the worse because of their company. Pauper. I pray to god
that evil mote they speed also oftymes as they take any man of relygyon or of
holy church for to go or to ride with them on huntyng. For such hunting with
horn and with hounds / and great noise is forboden to men of holy church.

see our savior and be full sorry. Distinct.lxxxvi. Vident. Dives. What sayste
thou of them that when they go on hunting / or pass by the way / if they
mete with a man of holy church or of relygyon / and namely with a friar they
will leave him on their lift hand / for by that they wene to speed the better /
and the worse if they leave hy^ on their right hand. Pauper. I say that such
ben of false believe and wytches peers. And but they amend the^ god shall put
them from his right hond / and put them on his lift hand with them that
shall be dampened at the day of dome / and send in to the pytte of hell
without end. I would that al such were served as one was full late. Dives.
How was he served. Pauper. There came a proud gettour riding from London and
met wit two freres walking on a dyches brynke in a foot pathe for to flee
the foul way. The gettour came riding in great haste cryeng with great boste.
On the left hand friar / on the left hand friar. The freres prayed him full
fair to ride forth in his way and keep the horse way / as they kept y^ foot
way. He would not but algates he would have the freres on ye left hand and
presced in with his horse between the freres and the dyche so nygh the dyche
that the freres shoue both horse and man in to a deep dyche. And there lay
both horse and man till that other folk coming by the way drew him out.
Right also without doubt but such foles amend them and let be such nyce
fantasyes / god at the day of dome shall put them on the left side in to the
pytte of hell without end / and say to them in this wise. For ye put me on
your side so scornefully / therefore I put you now on the lift hand with them
that shall be dampened. And if they say. Lord when did we put the on our
left hand scornefully or despytously. He shall answer and say to them as
he shall say to other. Quod vni ex minimis meis fecistis. michi fecistis. That
ye have done to one of the least of the mine / ye have done it to me. And
therefore go ye now on the lift side in to the fire of hell / there to dwell
with the fend and his angels without end.

Caplm.li.
Dives. Me list now more to weep than any thing more to speak. For I wend
till to now that the English nacyon had worshypped god passing all y^ other
nacyons. But now I see well that it is not so. For much of my nacyon is
entryked and blente with such fantasyes many mo than I can tell. And so they
forfete hyghely against the first commandment that ought most for to be
charged. For that techeth us how that we should worship our god above all
thing. And there is neither bysshopp ne prelate ne curate ne prechoure that
will speak against the vices and errors that been so high against gods
worship. And so by mysuse and sleuthe of men of holy church vice is take for
virtue / and error for treuthe / the fend is worshypped and god is despised.
Nevertheless as men say / god is in no land so well served in holy church /
ne so much worshyped in holy church as he is in this land. For so many fair
chirches ne so good array in chirches / ne so fair service as men say is in
none other lands as it is in this land. Pauper. As saint Gregorye says in
his Omelye / god takes more head to a man's heart than to his gift / and
more to his devotion than to his deed. He takes no great head says he how
much a man or woman gives or offreth in holy church / but he takes head of
how much deuoco^n and of what heart he gives and offreth. And so a poor man
or woman has some time more thank for the gift of an halfpeny / than some
rich man has for the gift of.xx. shelynges. If the making of chirches and
the ournamentes and the service in this land were done pryncypally for
devotion / and for the worship of god. I trow this land passed all other
lands in worshyppynge of god and holy church. But I dread me that men do it
more for pomp and pride of this world to have a name and worship thereby in
the contree / or for envy that one town has against an other / not for
deuoco^n / but for the worship and the name that they see them have by array
and ournamentes in holy church / or else by slygh couetyse of men of holy
church. Dives. What fantasye haste thou that men do it not for devotion.
Pauper. For the people now a days is full undevout to god and to holy church
/ and they love but full little men of holy church and they ben loathe for to
come in holy church when they be bound to come thither / and full loathe to
here gods service. Late they come and soon they go away. If they ben there
a little while them thinks full long They have lever to go to the tavern
than to holy church. Lever to here a song of Robynhode / or of some rybaudrye
/ than for to here mass or matynes / or any other of gods service or any
word of god. And sythen that the people has so little devotion to god and to
holy church. I can not see that they do such cost in holy church for
deuoco^n ne for the love of god For they despise god day and night with their
evil and wicked living and their wicked thewys.

Caplm.lij.
Dives. Me thinks that it were better to give the money to the poor folk /
to the blind and to the lame / whose souls god bought so dear / than so to
spend it in solempnyte and pride and making of high chirches / in rich
vestymentes / in curyouse wyndowes / in great belles / for god is not helped
thereby and the poor might be helped thereby full much. Pauper. If it be do for
pride / and not with good mesure they lose much mede. If they do it of
devotion with dyscreco^n / it is medefull. For every man poor and rich after
his power is bound to worship gods house / so that god lord of all be
honestly and worshypfully served. And therefore god bad in y^ old la^we that
his people should make-hym a full costly tabernacle at his own deuyse. And he
badde Solomon make him a full costly temple / and yet without doubt there was
many a poor man that time / both blind and lame among gods people. Moses.
Dauyd. Solomon. Ioas. Iosyas. Esdras Judas machabeus / and many other both in
the old law and in the new ben praised hyghely of god for making and
worshyppynge and mayntenynge of gods house and his service. And as we find
in the gospel / that there was a poor wydowe that offered to amendynge of
gods temple two mytes that been worth a ferthynge / and she was praised of
Christ for her offryng passing al other that offered than much more. And we
find Exodi.xxx. That god badde that in the nombrynge of the people every man
should pay to his tabernacle an half sycle / that was five pens / and that
the rich should give no more than / and the poor no less / in a token that
that rich and poor should be besy to worship and to mayntene gods house and
gods service. God badde that both the rich and poor should pay alyke / in
a token that the poor man should hold himself as much bound to god as the
rich / and the good as the wicked. The good is bound to god for he kept him
out of sin. The wicked is bound to god for he keeps him that he perysshe
not for his sin. Also god badde both rich and poor pay even much to his
tabernacle / in a token that they ben both bought with one price of Crystus
precyouse blood / and that they should both hold themself alyke bounden / and
that they have both alyke need of suffrages and help of holy church. Also god
badde them both give alyke in a token that he accepts their gifts both alyke
/ if their deuoco^n be alyke in their gyuynge that the rich man should not be
proud of his great gift and of his richesses / ne the poor fall in dyspayre
for his small gift and for his pouerte. Nevertheless who so may do most best
is bound to help gods house what it needs and so it is full nedeful to
array well gods house / and mayntene and increase gods service. And also it
is needful to help the poor folk in their great need / and sometime more
medefull than is that other. And therefore my friends thou must take heed to
the time and other cyrcumstau^ces. For in time of welthe / of peace / and of
plente / when the poor has enough or lightly may be helped / tha^ pryncypally
men should trauaylle to worshypp gods house and to increase and mayntene
gods service. But in time of woe war and hungre of pouerte and other
trybulaco^ns / than should men pryncypally trauayll besely to their even
christian / and take heed that no man ne woman perysshed for defaulte / but by
besye to help the nedy both by gyuyng and by lenyng. In a token of this we
read.ij. Regu^.vij. et.i. Paralip.vij. et.xxij. That god would not suffer the
king Dauyd to make his temple / notwithstanding but he would full feign have
made it / and brought and ordained full much things thereto. For in his time
the land was in great trybulacyon by war within and without / by hungre and
morayne / by dyscensyon and debate of them self. But he said to Dauyd y^
Solomon his sone should make him a temple. For he said he shall reygne in peace
and in rest / in so much that he shall be called a king peasyble / for in his
days I shall give peace and rest in the land of Israel. And Dauyd when he was
in peace and rest and had dysconfyte his enemies / than began he to ordeyn
for gods Temple and would have made it. God could him much thank for his
good will / but he would not suffer him for to make it / for he was not in so
good rest as he had went to have been in. For after that began a great war
against him. As we find.ij.0 Regum.vij.0 et.viij.0 And therefore god said to him.
Thou shall not make to me an house. for thou haste shed much blood / and
thou art a man of bloodshedynge before me. That is to say. I have ordained
the for to fight against mine enemies and for to slay them and so for to make
peace. And I have ordained thyn sone after the for to make me an house in peace
and in rest / there I shall set him in by thy fighting and by thy doing.

Caplm.liij.
But it fares now a days by much folk as it did by Judas the traitor. We
find in the gospel Iohe^e.xij. That Marye Magdaleyn anointed the blysful fete
of our lord Ihesu with a precious oynement / not for any great need that
Christ had thereof / but for the great love and deuoco^n that she had to him.
Judas was sorrow thereof and grutched and said / why is this oynement thus
lost. It might have been sold for three hundred pens / and be given to the
poor folk. But as saint Johan says in the same place. Judas said not tho
words for the love y^ he had to the poor folk / but for he was a thief and
robbed Christ and his dyscyples of money that was given to them. And therefore
he would that the oynemente should have be sold for three hundred pens and
given to Christ which loved well poor folk that he might have myched or
deled the money away / for he bare y^ purce. And for that cause that he had
not his purpose of the three hundred pens / therefore he should Christ for three
hundred pens / that was.xxx. plates and pieces of silver. For each one of tho
xxx. was worth.x. small pens. In the same manner / now a days some folk
grutche for deuocyons and nedeful cost that men done in holy church / and
say as Judas said / that it were better to give it to poor folk. But many of
tho give full little tale how evil the poor people fare / for they do full
lytyl to the poor folk or to holy church either. But by ypocresye and
symylacyon of almesdede / they withdrawn men's devotion from god and holy
church / and from poor folk also. And so they rob holy church and the
poor folk. For they done but little them self / and let other that would
do. And if they do alms to the poor blind and lame / they do it to have a
name and for to exclude or put behind great almesses that they ben bounden to
/ as to worshypp of holy church / and in case good mynystres in holy church /
and them that trauayll holyly in gods service / and study in gods law
night and day and preche it to the people indede and word / and have need of
bodily alms / of the which Christ says in the gospel. Luce.x. That such
work men and trauayllers ben worthy their mede And saint Poul says that
Christ has ordained them that teache the gospeel and gods law / for to live
by the gospel and by their prechynge / not like as beggars passing by the
way / but honestly and worshypfully as gods knights / as saint Austyn says
super illud. p^i. Producens fenu^ iumentis. And therefore they that repreue
needful things as making of chirches / of vestymentes and books / and
making of belles / they that grutchen against the holy service of god in holy
church ben but fools and in Judas caas. For they mayntene worldely worship
and let gods worship. Nevertheless they waste cost of all these things and
other in holy church done for pride and vayneglorye or of envy one parysshe
against a another / or for couetyse of the mynystres in the church seculer or
relygyouse is gretely always to be repreued.

Caplm.liiij.
Dives. God byddeth in the gospel. Mathei.vi. That when man or woman should
pray they should go in to their chamber and shytte the door to them / and so
pray the fader of heaven. Pauper. In tho words Christ techeth us not oonly
where we should pray / but he techeth us how we should pray. For the chamber
that we should enter in to pray is our heart / for in our prayers we should
gadre our in wytt and our thoughts togydre in our heart / and set our heart
oonly in god and take heed to our prayers. The door that we should shytte ben
our five wits outward to flee dystracco^n. For than we should keep well our
sight / our he ring / our feeling / our tastynge / and our smelling / that
there come no dystraccyon in to our heart by any of our five wits. And he
badde also in the same place / as that men in their prayers should flee
ypocresye and vain glory. And for to flee and to esche we all this it is full
spedefull to man or to woman when they may not go to the church to go in to
their chamber and so in to their oratorye for to say there their prayers and
deuocyons. But if they despise gods house and leave gods service for such
pryue prayers they sin grievously / and lose the mede of their preuy prayers.
And therefore the law byddeth that they that have preuy oratoryes or chapelles
by leave of the bishop for to here in their mass and their service / that in
great festes / as Ester. Crystmasse. Epyphanye. Ascenco^n. Pentecost. and saint
Johan baptyste / and other such / than they should go to church / and no
priest should than sing in such oratoryes or chapelles without specyale leave
of the bishop / and if he did he should be put from his mass. Deconsecra.
distinc.i. si quis extra. Both pryue prayers and open ben good if they ben done
in due manner and in due place and in due time. Prayers is good in chambres and
in oratoryes but it is better in holy church with the comunyte / when the time
is of common prayer / and when men may well attend thereto with fervent charity.
Synguler prayer of one person is good in a chamber and in an oratorye / but
better in a church with even charity. But common prayers of a comunyte in
church is better than a synguguler prayer if every part of that comunyte be
in charity For Christ says in the gospel / that if two or three be gadred
togydre in his name that is charity / there is he in the mids of them / that
is to say in their hertes to help them in their prayer. And if any of you
said he consent togydre by charity in her prayer / what soever they axe it
shall be do to them. Math xviij. And therefore says saint Ambrose. super illud.
ad To.xvi. Adiuuetis me in orthibus vestris. That when many small ben gadred
togydre they ben full great. And it is not possible that the prayers of much
people in charity should not speed. And therefore says the prophet Ioell ij.^
Halowe ye your fasting / call ye company to you / gadre ye the people
togydre. And when ye be gadred / so make you holy and clean of sin / take ye
the old folk with you / and gadre ye togydre the young childern soukyng all
to prayer. For right as a voice of a multitude is myghtyer and ferther may be
herd than the voice of one person allone / so is the voice and prayer of a
multitude sooner herd than a voice of one person allone and sooner geteth
grace / therefore says y^ prohete. Laudate dn^m oe^s gentes. et collaudate eu^
oe^s populi. All folks praise ye your lord / and all peoples praise ye him
togydre. And saint Poule says ad Colocen^.iiij. Byddeth that men should give
them to prayers and walk in praer and thankynges in that they should pray al
togydre. Dives. Much people lie seek in their bed / and much in prison /
many one in the sea and in many other needful occupacyons / and may not come
to the church / and men dwell in many diverse lands many a thousand miles
bysondre / how should they pray and praise god all togydre. Pauper. All if they
may not come togydre all in one place ne in one church / yet they must come
togydre in charity / that the multitude of christian people be of one heart and
of one love and of one faith.

Caplm.lv.
Dives. We make many gadrynges togydre many general processyons and prayers in
common to pray for peace / and yet have we no peace / but every year more war
than other / and every year speed worse than other. Pauper. If men came togydre
and made their prayers in lowness / clenesse and charity / god shall here
them. For he says if two or three consent togydre in charity / what they axe
in the worship of god and to the help of their souls it shall be done to them
of my fath But our prayers and processyons be against charity made with great
pride. For tho if men go in processyon for peace / and sing and say with their
mouth. Da pace^ dn^e. Lord give us peace / yet with heart men pray all against
peace. For they would no peace have / ne desire no peace / but always to have
war and to shede christian me^nes blood. For not withstanding all the myschyef
there the people is in because of war / and tho we have the worste on every
side yet the people says that it is better for to have war than peace / and
they have lever to here of war than of peace. And they say that they may not
live without war. And when god sent them worshypfull peace on every side they
despise peace / and slay them that made peace for that yt they trauayled to make
peace. And the people had lever pay great taxes for she dynge of man's blood
than for to pay small taxes for to have peace. And sythen they love no peace /
ne desire no peace and will have none peace though god will give them peace /
without doubt they pray not for peace. For no man prays for a thing that
they will not have. And so in their prayers and processyons they scorn god /
and more provoke him to vengeance than to mercy. Also they make not their
prayers with lownes but with greece pride / for they will not be known of any
myschyef. They hold them self so strong and so wise that as them thinks
they have no need of any help. And therefore though god hereth us not in our
praers ne helps us not it is no wonder For with our mouth we axe peace / but
with our heart we axe war / and with our mouth we say kyryeleyson. Lord have
mercy on us / but with our heart we pray him for to help us to slay our even
christian that would feign live in peace. And so our prayer is all out of charity
/ and our living is full sinful and full hyghely against the pleasaunce of god.

Caplm.lvi.
Dives. It is a common proverb / that a short prayer thyrleth heaven. Oracio
breuis penetrat celum. And therefore says Christ in the gospel. Mathei.vi.
Orantes nolite multu^ loqui. When that ye pray says he / speak ye not much.
Pauper. It is a common proverb of truantes that soon be weary of their prayers
/ and have more haste to the tavern than to holy church / and have more
liking in the world than in god. Nevertheless if it be well understand / the
proverb is true good and holy. For every thing is called short when ye ends
bennyghe togydre. And the more ferther that ye ends of any thing is bytweyne
the more longer is the thing. And so it fares by prayers. For that one end
of our prayer is our heart / and that other end is god. And therefore says
saint Austyn / that prayer is a styeng up of a man's heart to god. And in this
manner the nerer a man's heart is to god in his prayer by love and lowness and
deuoco^n and right intenco^n / y^ more shorter is his prayer and this manner of
prayer thyrleth heaven. For as holy write says / ye prayer of him that loweth
hy^ in his prayer thyrleth the skies or the clouds. For the more that a man
loweth him in his prayer / the more nygher he is to god / for than god of his
mercy boweth down to hy^. And therefore says Christ / that he that so loweth
him self in his prayer he shall be hyghed up to god. And therefore says saint
James / that god withdraws the proud / and to the low and meke he gives
his grace. And in this manner speak a man never so much / as long as his heart
is nyghe to god by love and lowness / and with good intenco^n and devotion /
so long his prayer is but short though he speak never so much with his
mouth. And as long as he may continue his prayer so in deuoco^n / it is lefull
and medefull to speak in his prayer. But when his speech begins to let him
of his deuoco^n it is good to cesse of his vocal prayer that is in his own
fre will. But if he be bound thereto by a vow or confession / or by order / or
by office / than he must say his bedes that he is bound to and do his dute /
and he must say it distynctely not to hastly ne to saftly. For if he say it
to hastly he may lightly over escape / and if he say it to saftly he may fall
in to great dystraccyon and lose much time / and leave thereby many good deeds
that he might else do / and bring him self in lesynge of prayer and lettyng
of devotion of him self and of the people also that would here his prayers and
his office.

Dives. Why badde than Christ that men should not speak much in their prayer
Pauper. Christ badde not utterly that men should not speak much in their
prayers / but he badde that men should not speak much in their prayers as
hethen men do. For they wene that god should not here them but if they spoke
much. Also he badde us not speak much in our prayers as ypocrytes done for to
be holden holy and so get men's good. For as Christ says in the gospel
Luce.xxiij. Such devour wy^dowes houses by faynynge of long prayers. For as
the gloss says there / they pray longer than other for to be holden more
relygyouse and more holyer than other / and therefore their prayers torneth in
to sin / in so much that they may neither well pray for them self ne for
none other / and for such prayers they shall the more be dampened / as Christ
says in the same place Mar.vij. This people worshyppen me with their lyppes /
but their heart is full far fro me. For god is in heaven / and their heart and
thought is all in earth. It is a common proverb / that who so speaks unwisely
and vaynely / or in an evil manner / he speaks to much. And therefore as long
as a man or woman prays wisely / deuoutely / and with good intencyon / so
long they speak not to much. But if they pray unwisely with pride and evil
intencyon / they speak to much though they speak never so lytyl. And therefore
the pharyse spoke to much in his prayer / for he spoke all with pride. And
Peter spoke to much / for he spoke unwisely / and therefore Christ repreued
them both. Also they speak to much in their prayers that set their heart
and faith more in sownynge and saying of the words than they do to god / or in
the things that they pray for / and say again and often again wenyng that god
herd them not but by such yteracyons till that they ben weary / and so leave
many deuocyons that they should say. And therefore says ye wise man Non iteres
verbu^ in oraco^e tua Eccle vij. Say no word again in thy pray For such
doubt is lettynge of devotion / for such speak over much and make their
prayers in wanbyleue. For if man's heart be to god ward god hereth his
prayers long byfor er he speak it with his mouth. Dives. Sythen god is over
all present / why pray we more in holy church than in other places. Pauper.
For as much as he is over all / therefore in every place he ought to be
worshyped. But for asmoche as we may not worship hy^ in due manner in every
place. Therefore is holy church ordained that men should fulfylle there yt they
leave in other places. And therefore in every law god has ordained certain
places of prayers where he would be worshyped in / passing other places / and
that for many causes. First for common prayers and praysynge is more pleasant
as I said first. Also to flee errors and ydolatrye. For if each man or woman
drew him always allone in his prayers / the fend should dysceyue h^^ by
Illusyons and by Iapes / as he does commonly them that flee company / and love
well to be much solytarye. Also for to exclude sloth in gods service that
man and woman should fall in. For but they were bound to come togydre in some
certain place for to worship her god and to here gods law / they would
else go playenge and worship god in no place but full seldom. And they would
excuse them by uncunning if they did amys. Also holy church is ordained for
common prayers and gods service that each man and woman may bear wytnes of
other at the day of dome against the fend / that he did in that as a christian
man ought to do and served his god. For as saint Poule says / we must all
have wytnes of our faith by deeds and tokenes outward.

Caplm.lviij.
Dives. whereto should we pray to god for any thing / for he is not chau^geable
/ and he may naught give us but he wyste it well before the beginning of the
world what he should give us. Pauper. We do not pray for to change his
endeles ordenau^ce / but for to get to us by prayer that he has ordained
without end to grant it us by prayers. For sythen he is our lord / and we
may naught do / ne nothing have without him therefore he will that we pray to
him as to our lord / and in our prayers knowlechyng him our lord. And he will
not grant us many things yt us needs but we pray him therefore Dives. Why
pray we to god with our mouth sythen he knows all our thoughts / all our
desire / all our will and all what us needs. Pauper. For as I said first /
god will yt we know leche him for our lord / and knowleche our need yt we may
nothing do / ne nothing have without him / the which knowlechyng must be done
with the mouth. For saint Poule says. If a man or woman will be saved / he must
have right believe in heart inward and knowleche it outward with his mouth.
To.x. Cord em^ credi^ ad iusticia^ore au^t co^fessio fit ad salute^. More over
my friends ye shall understand that there is two manner of prayers / one is
common / an other is synguler. Common prayer is the prayers of the mynystres of
holy church and of common persons in holy church / which prayers they make
in the name of all the people. And this manner of prayer must be done by mouth /
that the people may know that they pray for them. And therefore it is ordained
by the law that such prayers should be said / and sometime song openly with
an high voice that the people may here it. But synguler prayer that is done
but of one synguler person / it may be done with heart allone without voice of
the mouth. Nevertheless sometime it is good to him yt prays to pray by mouth.
And that for many causes. First to excyte his heart to more devotion by tokens
outward. And therefore as long as a man or a woman is styred to devotion by
speech or vocal prayer / by knelynge / bowynge / fasting / or any other
obseruau^ce reasonable / so long it is well done to use it in his prayer / but
if he be letred thereby from deuoco^n and fall thereby in dystracco^n / it is
better to leave it for a time than to use it. For we find primo Regu^.ij. That
Anna spoke in her heart to god with bitter teres / and yet there herd noman her
voice. Also men pray with the voice of the mouth in yeldynge of debt. For
man is bounden to serve god with all his might and virtue that god has given
him / with heart word and work / with all his might and all his wit. And
therefore holy church syngeth and says. Os lingua men's sensus vigor
confessione^ personent. Mouth tongue wit and might make knowlechynge and
praysynge to god. And in this manner bedes bidding is part of satysfaccyon for
sin. Also men pray with voice of the mouth for great deuoco^n that is inward
in heart / which breketh out by speech of the mouth / as says Christ in the
gospel. Luce.vi. Ex habundancia cordis os loquitur. The mouth says he
speaks of such things whereof it is plente in the heart. And therefore the
prophet says Letatu^ est cor meu^ et exultauit lingua mea. Mine heart says
he was merry and glad inward / and anon mine tongue made Joy outward. Also
men pray with voices in speech to the more confusyon of the fend / for he may
not know men's deuoco^n inward but by tokens outward. And the more devotion
and love that he sees men to have to god / the more is it his confusyon and
pain. And therefore is he so besy now a days to tempte men in holy church to
pride / to couetyse / sleu the / glotonye / and lecherye / for to let holy
prayers in holy church / which is to him very confusyon and sorrow. And
therefore says the prophet of hy^ when he hereth holy prayers and sees men
devout. Peccator videbit et irascetur. dentibus suis ^^emit et tabescet The
sinful wretch the fend of hell shall see men's deuoco^n / and he shall be
full wroth. He shall gnasche or gnare with his teeth and be full evil abashed.
For the desires of the deuylles and their discyples y^ would let holy prayers
shall perysshe and come to naught.

Dives. In the beginning of holy church and in the time of the apostles was
no such service and solempnyte in holy church as now is. Pauper. Than were
but few christian men / and neither they might ne durst make such solempnyte
for tyrau^trye of the hethen people. Their will was good / but they might not /
but as they myghten they did worship to god and increased gods service. And
therefore we read in the life of saint Clement that by his prechynge and techynge
within one year were made.lxx. chirches in one lytylyle of Cerlone /
notwithstanding y^ there were two thousand of poor christian men outlawed and
dampened to full hard trauayll / and might have be releued full well with that
y^ tho chirches costed. Than holy church was in his youth and in his
beginning / as saint Ierom says in prologo super actus aplorum Now holy
church is grown / and the faith sprongen and spredde and stabled in peace fro
tyrau^tes. And therefore now we must worshypp our god with all our might and
our conning / for we have none excusaco^n as they had. And for to avoid
idleness of prestes our faders before this time ordained the prayers in holy
church to be said after a certain form / after the custom of diverse
contrees keep their hour after the hours of the day / as matynes at morrow
and mass afterward / and euensonge against even so that god shall be praised
of the prestes at all times of the day. Dives Me thinks yt it were better to
say gods service in holy church without note than with note and hackynge of
the syllabes and words of our prayers and praysynge as as we do For who should
tell the king of England a tale or make his prayer to him and made so many
notes and hackynges in his tale / he should have little thank. Pauper. The
king of heaven is above the king of England / and otherwise we must worship
him than y^ king of England. For we must worship him with all our might / and
all our heart / and all our wit / as him yt is maker and lord of all thing
/ and so may we not worship the king of England. It needs now to speak to the
king of England and to every erthely man dystynctly / for they know not the
man's heart ne his will. But god knows it long er we speak it with our
mouth. And therefore when we sing in our prayers with cle^nesse of life and
deuoco^n of heart / we please god in as much as we worshyh him with our power
of voice and tongue For every note so song to god in the church or in other
conuenyent places for deuoco^n in our self / and to engendre deuoco^n in to
other is a praysynge to god. And therefore Dauyd says. Cantate exultate et
psallite. Sing ye and make you merry outward / and sing ye to god craftily.
Iubilate deo ois terra. seruite dn^o in leticia. Introite in conspectu eius. in
exultaco^e. All ye yt dwell upon the earth / make ye hertely Joy to god /
serve ye our lord in gladness. Enter ye in to his syghte with Joy and
myrthe. For many causes my friends song and melodye was ordained in holy
church. First to the more worship of god. Also to the more excytaco^n of
deuoco^n to the people Also to put away heaviness and vnlustynesse / as says
saint Bernarde. For many man has more liking for to serve god in gladness
than in heaviness. And therefore gods service should be said lively /
dystynctly / and devoutly with gladness of heart. For if the service be said
or song so hauenly and dedely and so drawn a long that it loathe both the
synger or sayer and the herer / and brings folk in to heaviness or
dystracco^n / it is evil said or song. For that manner of singing is lettynge
of much goodness / and cause of idleness and of much folly / for it makes
men to withdraw them from gods house and from gods service / and so want
grace. De conse. did. v. Non mediocrit. Also we sing in holy church to
confourme us to saints in heaven which praise god and serve god always with
high voice and sweet singing / as we find in the Apocalypse and many other
places in holy write. And therefore says Dauyd. Cantate dn^o canticu^ nouu^.
laus eius in ecclia sanctorum. Sing ye a new song to our lord / for such
is his prysynge in holy church of all saints. And therefore song in holy
church is good when it is song deuoutely in clennes of life / roundely not
lettynge the devout prayers of the people / as does this curyouse knackynge
song of the vycyouse mynystres in the church / and specially in great and
rich chirches. For it is often seen / that the syngers in such places and
other also ben full proud glotons and lecherous also. And the melodye of such
men is no plesaunce to god / but it does harm to them self and many other.

Dives. Why ben there now no martyrs as there were wont for to be. Pauper. We
have now a days all to many martyrs in this land. Dives. How so. Pauper. For
the more martyrs the more murdre and manslaughter and the more shedynge of
Innocents blood / the more vengeance shall fall therefore. Dives. Much
people is slain now a days / but if they should be martyrs I can not say.
Pauper. All that be slain for the treuthe pacyently in charity ben martyrs /
in as much as they wytnessen the treuthe and stand therewith unto their death
For martyr in latin is a witness in english. It is no worship to any land
or nacyons for to have many martyrs of her own sleynge / but it is an endless
shame. And therefore the Jews that slew Christ and his dyscyples / and the
prophets and mad^ martyrs without nombre / ben in despyte and repreue all
about the world. And therefore Christ said to them that all the rightful blood
which they had shed fro the beginning of the world should fall upon them
/ and an hard vengeance therefore should come to them. And the Romans that
slew Peter and many martyrs in every land there as they had lordshyp / and
now they have lost there lordshyp and ben wretches of wretches / and both the
cite and the temple seems acursed. And now English naco^n has made many
martyrs. For they spare neither their own king ne their bysshoppes / no
dygnyte / no order / none astate ne degree / but indyfferently slay as them
lyketh / and so vengeance and wretchedness follows them / and grace and
worship has forsaken them / it was never worship to them that they slew saint
Thomas their bishop and their fader / ne that they would by common clamor and
common assent have slain their own king. Martyrdom is worshypfull to them
that in charity suffers death / and to them y^ hold with them in their
treuthe. But it is shame and dyshoneste to them that put them to death
unrightfully. And for asmoche as the multitude of shrewes is so great / and
falshede is so mighty that the treuth is ouersette and borne down / and true
folk so martred / we should weep and not be glad for that we have so many
martyrs / and night and day cry mercy to let wretch. If hethen people or
other naco^ns had made our martyrs than we might rejoice us of our martyrs /
but in that we have slain them our self we ought to be ashamed.

Caplm.lxi.
Dives. Sythen they be martyrs why does god no miracle now for them as he did
for martyrs and other saints in the beginning of holy church. Pauper. If a
lord have but a few servants that been true / he will praise them and
magnefye them and do them worship / both to hold them stylle in his service /
and also to draw other to his service by ensample of them. And the same does
the maystre in the scole to the childern that learn well. And when the mother
has but one child she cheryseth the more / and keeps him the more godely and
derely. Right so Christ in the beginning of holy church had but few good
dyscyples or true servants / and therefore he worshypped and magnefyed them
with great miracles to comfort them in the faith / and for to draw other to
the faith. For but god had showed than great miracles and many / they that were
in the faith should have forsaken the faith and few would have come to the
faith. And it fares by holy church and by y^ faith as it does by a tree /
when a tree is newely set men water it and set stakes and poles about to
strength it against the wyndes blastes and for storms / it should else bryse
it or break it and fell it a down. But when it is well roted and commonly wexen
than men cesse of waterynge and take away the stakes and the poles. Right so
when holy church and crystendome was in the beginning Christ watered holy
church with great gifts of grace and of deuoco^n / and vndersette it with
great wondres and miracles which he showed that time against the hard storms
of persecuco^n that was that time against the faith of holy church. But now
holy church is spro^gen and spredde and the faith is stabled in men's heart /
and therefore such miracles cesse. And if any such miracles fall in any land
among any christian people / it is a token that some of them be not stable in
the faith / and that god is not well apayed with the people. For saint Poule
says that tokens and miracles ben not given to folk of right believe / but to
folk of false believe And the more miracles that men see / the less mede they
have for their faith / as saint Gregory says in his Omely. And so multitude of
martyrs and of miracles preue not by the goodness of the heople there they ben
done among / but rather they show and preue the malice of the people when god
would destroy the kyngedome of Israel and of Judah for ydolatrye and other
sin that nygh all the people was fallen in / he sent his famous prophets /
as Hely and Helyzee Ysaye. Ieremye. Danyell. Ezechyell and other.xij. prophets
which taught the people gods law / and warned them of myschyef coming but
they would amend them. And they confermed their prophecy with many great
miracles / and yet the people was worse than ever they were before. At the
last Christ came to preche and to teache them and did many wondres / and heled
all manner sekenesses / and sent his apostles also among them / which did
many wondrefull miracles. And yet the people was than more worser than ever
they were aforne. In so much that they slew not oonly the prophets and the
apostles and Crystus dyscyples / but they slew Christ himself gods sone of
heaven and lord of all thing / which had done them so much worship and done
so many wondrefull cures among them.

Caplm.lxij.
Dives. I trow that if men were now as holy as men were than / they should do
miracles now so well as they did than Pauper. Though they were as holy or
holyer / they should not do such miracles / for they be not now so needful as
they were that time / ne it were not prouffytable to the people as I said right
now. And I hope that they ben as holy that do no miracles as many of them that
done miracles. For such doing of miracles stands not in the holiness of
him that does the miracle / but it stands in the calling and in the virtue
of gods name to the prouffyte of other / and often to dampnaco^n of hy^ that
so calls gods name and does the miracle. As says the gloss / super illud
Mathei.vij. Dn^e no^ne in noie tuo prophetauimus. Dives. It seems thereby that
shrewes and evil wicked lyuers may do miracles. Pauper. Christ says so him
self Math.vij. For as we read there / at the day of dome many that shall be
dampened / shall say to Christ. O lord we prophesied in thy name and casted
out fendes and did many tokens and miracles in thy name. But he shall say to
them again. Goo thou hens fro me ye werkers of wickedness. I know you not for
none of mine. And as saint Johan Crysostomus says in tractatu. Nemo leditur
nisi a semetip so. That Judas the traitor had power of god for to do and
did many great miracles / and yet is he dampened. Also doing of miracles is no
syker token of goodness neither of the doer ne of the people there as that
they ben done / but oonly charity and good living ben syker tokens of
godenesse. And therefore Christ taught us to know the good prophets from the
wicked / not by her miracles ne by their prophecy / but by her good deeds and
charity. Thereby says he men shall know that ye be my dyscyples if ye have
charity among you / not by miracles ne by prophecy. For Judas did miracles /
and Cayphas and Balaam full cursed wretches prophesied full truly. And saint
Johan baptyste that was so holy did never such miracles by his life. And
therefore Christ badde that we should take heed to men's deeds and know them
by their fruit. Dives. Ypocrytes and heretykes do many full good deeds and yet
be they shrewes. Pauper. Such manner of folk have two manner of deeds. Done
pryuely / and another in aperte or openly. Their deeds openly ben not theyrs /
but they ben clothynges of sheep under which they hele them or cover them as
wulues to dysceyue good sheep. And therefore Christ byddeth in the gospel yt we
should beware of false prophets / they y^ come to us in clothing of sheep /
for they ben inward wulues of raueyn. If their deeds be wicked / it is her
own clothyng whereby they may be known / but their preuy works and their
preuy techynge ben their own fruit which commonly ben full wicked. And so by
that that they do and teache pryuely me^ may best know what they ben. Dives. I
may well assente to thy speech / for so many wondres as have fallen in this
land with in a few years / in some moan and sterres / in land and water / in
the air / y^ we read in no book yt ever fell so many in so lytyl time / and as
men say full wicked lyuers do many miracles and prophecye / and yet we want
grace on every side / and the hard vengeance of god is upon us night and day
/ showing that we have grievously offended our god. Pauper. As says y^ gloss
super illud ij^. ad Thessalo.ij^. In signis et prodigijs mendacibus. For as
much as the people is out of charity and will not know the treuthe / but
trust all in lesynges and in falshode. Therefore god suffers false shrewes for
to do wondres and miracles for to dysceyue the people and to hold them stylle
in their error. I have said as my thinks / and say thou forth what thou
will.

Caplm.lxiij.
Dives. What sayste thou of them that will no solempnyte have in their
buryeng / but be put in earth anon / and that that should be spente about the
buryenge of them / they bydde that it should be given to the poor folk as
blind and lame. Pauper. Commonly in such preuy buryenges ben full small doles
and but little almesses given. And in solemn buryenges ben great doles and
much almesses given / for much poor people come than for to syke their
alms. But when that it is done so pryuely few men know thereof / and full
few poor people come for to axe alms / for they know not when ne where ne
to whom they should axe it. And therefore I believe sykerly that some false
executours that would keep the goods all to them self began first this
error and this folly. Dives. And yet men hold it a great perfeccyon now a
days. Pauper. Though men burye their friends pryuely or openly / it is no
harm to the deed neither to living. But if the worship of god be withdrawn
/ and the almesses of the poor nedy folk / and the holy prayers and the
suffragyes of holy church / the which ben ordained for to be prayed and done
for the deed folk and the quycke that have great need thereof. But it is a
great folly and also a great sin for to forsake solemn buryenges / that been
done pryncypally for the worship of god and for the prouffyte of the deed folk
/ spending their goods to needful releuynge of holy church / and for ye
prouffyte of the poor nedy people that been of no power for to help them
self / for that is a custom of false executours that wolden make them self
rich with the deed folks goods / and dele it not to the poor folk after
the deed folks will as now all false executours use by custom. And so they
that forsake worshypfull buryenges as I have reherced before / they let the
praysyng / the worship / and the sacrefyce and offerynges that should be done
to god. They do also great despyte to holy church / in so much that they
forsaken the prayers and the suffragyes of the holy mynystres of holy church.
Also they offend gretely against all the souls that been in purgatory that
should be releued by masses singing by the prayers and suffragyes of holy
church / which ben ordained in the buryenge of deed folk for the help of
all christian souls. And they please the fend y^ which is full besy night and
day for to let gods office / gods worship and holy prayers. Also they
offend greatly against man kind / and against god that took mankind of a woman
/ in as much as they put their bodies in such dspyte and pryue or take it of
the due worship. For the body of a good man or of a good woman that is
knytte to that precious soul that Christ bought so dear with his precious
blood / with which soul it shall arise again at the day of dome / and shall
live in bliss without end bryghter than y^ son / it is of a full great
dygnyte / all if it be here in great myschyef for a time for Adams sin.
Man's body is of full grere dygnyte in that / that god took our body of a
woman allone / and bycame man without part of man / and bodily in our kind
reygneth god and man above all creatures. And therefore by way of kind and for
worship of god that took our kind / it ought for to be worshypped / namely in
his death / for than is there no dread of pride. And therefore says the wise man
Eccle.vij. Mortuo non prohibeas graciam. Withdraw not thy grace and thy mercy
from the deed. That is to say / withdraw not ne let not the due service and
worshypfull Ceremonies that longen to the bodies / ne the suffrages and prayers
that longen to the souls / as the gloss says. And in an other place he says
thus. Sone weep thou for the deed man with bitter teres and great sorrow / and
after his astate as right is hele his body / despise not his buryenge / make
morning one day or two after his deseruynge Ecclesiasti. xxxviij. For by the
law of kind / by the law written / by the law of grace / and every time
worshypfull sepulture after men's power has be due debt to man's body and
womannes. In the law of kind have we example of Abraham Ysaac and Jacob / and
her wives / which had full costely buryenges. As we read in holy write Gen^.
lvi. And in the law written have we example of Samuel. Dauyd. Solomon.
Iosaphat. Ezechye. Iosye. Tobye / and of the Machabeys / whose buryenges were
costly and worshypfully. In the law of grace / that is in the new law have
we example of our lord Ihesu Christ / which not withstanding how well he
suffered spytefull death for mankind / yet he would have and had worshypful
and costely sepulture and buryenge. As we find in the gospel. Johannes.xix.
Whereby as the gloss says / there he gave men example to keep worshypfull
buryenge after the custom of the contree. And therefore he commended Marye
magdaleyn / that she came before his death to anoynte his body so precyously
and so costely in to the sepulture. And many saints were buried worshypfully
by the doings of angellys / as saint Clement saint Katheryne / saint Agathe /
and many other. And saint Poule the first hermyte was buried worshypfully and
wonderly by werkynge of lions and of wild bestes / in tokenynge yt man's
body and woma^nes ought to have worshypful sepulture / for sythen angellys and
wild bestes did such worshypp to man's body after his death. Much more
mankind should worship man's body after his death / and do worship to his
own kind. And so men should releue poor folk in their myschyef / and
specially in their deynge by alms gyuynge. But they should not for that do
any wrong by their living to their even christian for to make them rich for to
do much alms at their ending. For as ye law says / there should no man be
made rich with wrong and harm of an other. Locupletari no^ debes aliqis cu^

Dives. What sayste thou of them that hold markettes and feyres in holy
church and in sanctuarye. Pauper. Both the byer and the seller and the men of
holy church that mayntene them or suffer them when that they might let it
ben accursed. For we find not that ever Christ punysshed so hard any sin
whiles that he went here in earth / as he did byeng and selling in gods
house as we find Io.xi. On a time he came in to the temple of Iherusalem / and
there he found men byeng and selling oxen and sheep and douues to be offered
in the temple / and chaungers of money also to be offered in the temple. He was
hyghely offended / and made a scourge and bette them out of the temple / and
said to them in this wise. Mine house should be an house of prayers / and ye
have made it a den of thieves. Bear ye out said he this marchau^dyse. Led
hens these bestes and make ye not my fads house an house of marchau^dyse and a
den of thieves. And as saint Matthew tells and other gospellers / he drew
down her bothes / and ouertourned their stalles and their setes and shed
their money. And as saint Mark says / he would not suffer no vessel that
was not longing to y^ temple for to be borne through the temple. And sythen
Christ would not suffer things to be sold in the temple / that was only for
the worship of god and help of the temple. Much more he will not suffer
things to be sold in the temple that longs not to the temple / but oonly to
seculers. Dives. Sythen god was so offended for that men sold therein yt that
was needful to the temple / and for easement of them that came fro far
contrees / what should he have done if he had found them byeng and selling
things of seculers. Or if he had found them in bacbytynge and glotony /
dronkenshyp / lecherye / in song and speech of rybaudrye / as men use now a
days in holy church. Pauper. Saint Austyn says / that as he troweth he
should have cast them to the pytte of hell. Dives. How might Christ that was
so poor a man have cast out such a multitude of people It is a wondre that
they withstoden him not. Pauper. For as the gloss says / there came such a
light out of his face by way of his godhode as long as he would that they
were all aferde of the sight of his face and fled away. And for the same
cause in time of his passion when they came for to take him / he said I am he
that ye seek / twyes they went bacwarde / and for dread fell down to the
ground. Dives. Why said he that they made his house a den of thieves. Pauper.
For who so is about for to begyle any man or woman of his good / he is a thief.
And in byeng and selling either of them is about for to begyle other / and in
that they ben thieves. And for that they do it in gods house and there cast in
their heart how pryuely and how slyghely they may begyle her even christian /
therefore they make gods house a den of thieves. And commonly in such feyres
and markettes where so ever it be holden / there ben many thieves mychers and
cut purces. Dives. And I dread me that full often by such feyres gods house
is made a tavern of glotones / and a bordell of lechours. For the merchants
and chapmen keep there with them their wives and le^mannes both night and
day. Pauper. And if any man comyne there flesshely with his wife or his le^men
/ the church and the church yerde also ben pollute. And if it might be preued
/ there should no preeste sing ne say no mass therein / ne body be buried
till it were recou^seylled again by the bishop. De con. di.i. Si motu^. et c^.
significasti. Et Io. in su^ma sua li.iiij. ti^. CC.xliij. Vtru^ liceat. Et
durandus in sn^ia sua li.ij. per.i. di.viij. q^.xxxiij. Dives. And what if the
prelates and the curates of y^ place take money of the chapmen for the place
that they stand in by covenant made before / is it any symonye so to selle
the land of the sentuary. Pauper. It is sy^onye full great for to selle any
ground in the sentuarye for buryenge / as the law shows well.xiij. q^.ij.
q^sta. et c^. seq^nti. Much more to selle it or to let it to hyre for
marchaundyse. And therefore such marchaundyse in holy church is forboden / not
oonly by the gospel / but also by the common law. xvi.q^.vij. Et hec diximus.
For men of holy church by such symonye and taking of things that they have
no right to / they ben bycome strong thieves / and make the chapmen thieves in
that / that they do them occupye the place in sentuarye against gods will
lord of y^ place. And so they make gods house a dwelling and a den of
thieves. Dives. Sythen men of holy church do so much despyte to god and holy
church / though they be in despyte them self / it is no wonder. Pauper. That
is soth. For god says in holy write. Pri^. regu^.ij. Who so worshyppeth me
says he. I shall make him worshyfull / and they that despise me / shall be in
despyte. Dives. I thank the with all mine heart / for that thought me some
time no sin / now I know well that it is a full grievous dedely sin. For
the sins and the errors that we have now spoken of / ben openly against the
worship of the high mageste of god / and against the first commandment
that most ought to be charged. And thy reasons ben so great and thy speech so
open / that Ignorance might not excuse me ne any thing else that can reason.
And yet the people by evil custom and Ignorance of men of holy church and
of them self also by couetyse and pride of the clergy is so blent that they
think them no sins. And so we goo in sin all blente with folly and want
grace. Pauper. Wicked custom engendered sin and not excuses sin. And
therefore the law says that every wicked custom it should be done away.

Here ends the first commandment. And begins the second commandment.
Caplm primu^.
Dives. I pray the enfourme me now in y^ second co^mau^demente. Pauper. What
doubt haste thou there in. Dives. In the second commandment god byddeth
that we should not take his name in vain / for who so does shall be gylty and
shall not pass unpunished. Pauper. In three manners gods name is taken in
vain. That is by myslyuynge / by myspeche / and by myshe ring. First by
myslyuynge / for wha^ man or woman is crystened / there he forsakes the fend
and all his works / and his lordshypp / when his godfader and his godmoder
answeren for him saying. Abrenuncio. That is to say. I forsake. And there he
knytteth him to Christ / and makes covenant with him for to be his true
servant without end. And there he takes the name of Christ upon him and be
comes christian. For all christian poeple is named after Christ / and he is our
pryncypall godfader. For christian comes of Christ / and so all christian people
bear y^ name of Christ upon them And so in as much as we ben called christian
and gods people / in that we bear the name of god upon us. And therefore says
the prophet. Tu in nobis es dn^e et nomen sanctum tuum inuocatum est super
nos. ne derelinquas nos dn^e deus noster. Ieremye xiiij. Lord says he thou
art among us as a lord among his servants / and thyn holy name is
called upon us / lord our god forsake us not. But if it be so / that we live
not after our name that we have taken of Christ / ne live not as christian men
as gods servants / but forsake him and torn again to the fend and live not
as christian folk / but as Jews / sarasyns / or paynyms / or else worse / than
take we gods name in vain / for our name and our life accords not. And as
says saint Poule / wicked christian people with their wicked deeds and their
wicked living forsaken god. And therefore all wicked lyuers / and namely
ypocrytes that beren the name of holiness and of Crystus servants / and with
that they ben the fendes servants / they take gods name in vain / and do
great despite to gods name. And therefore Christ says to such wicked christian
people. Per vos tota die nome^ meu^ blasphemat in gentibus Ysaye. lij Et ad
To.ij. My name is despised by you every day among other nacyons or hethen men
For by the wicked living of christian people the name of Christ is ashamed. And
therefore we say in our prayer. Sanctificet nome^ tuu^. Hallowed and worshypped
be thy name. That is to say / grant us grace no thing to do / ne will / ne
to speak that / whereby thy name should be vnworshyped or ashamed in us.

Caplm.ij.
ALso gods name is taken in vain by much speech / and that in many wise.
First by namynge of gods name in vain / in tales telling / in Iapery / in
scorn for in such vanyte gods name should not be named. Dives. Tell some
ensample. Pauper. As if one said to ye in scorn when he is wroth with the /
god make the a good man. And some say of an other in scorn / that god has
forsaken him / and Iapers and dyce players commonly name gods name in vain in
this manner / though they swear none oath. And all such take gods name in
idleness / that teache any errors or heresies ayenste the faith and against god
/ or preche or teache the treuthe oonly for couetyse / or for envy / or for
vain glory / and not for health of man's soul / ne for worship of god. And
therefore the prophet says thus. Peccatori aute^ dixit deus. quare tu enarras
iusticias meas. et assumis testamentu^ meum peros tuum. God says to the
sinful man / why tellest thou my rightfulnesses / and takeste my testament and
my law by thy mouth / and so often nameste my name. For all tho that teache well
and speak well and will not do thereafter / they take gods name in vain. Also
gods name is taken in vain by cursynge and swerynge / as when men or wymen
in wrath or else in nyce myrthe say to an other / god give the myschau^ce /
god give the evil grace / evil death. Also it is taken in vain oftymes by
vows making and that in diverse manner. First if man make any vows to any
creature. For vows making is a dyuyne worship that ought to be done only to
god and to no creature. And therefore the prophet says. Vouete et reddite dn^o
deo vestro. Make ye your vows to our lord god / and yeldeth them to him. Also
it is taken in vain when that the people keep not their vows that been lefull
/ but break them retchelesly or wylfully / or by freylte without need and
without auctoryte of their soueraynes / which have power for to dyspense them
or to change their vows. Also if men make vows unlawful against charity / and
to do any thing against gods law. As if thou made a vow for to slay thyn
even christian / or that you sholdeste never do good to poor men / for
peraue^ture some poor man has aggreued the. Also when men make vows unwisely
lightly without auysement and by common custom of speech.

Caplm.iij.
Dives. And such vows ben made now a days full many. For with much folk be
they ones spoken / they ben no more thought on / for they ben so common in their
mouth. Pauper. Therefore they sin full grievously / so taking gods name in
vain. For there should no vow be made but for a thing of charity and with a
good auysemente. We find in holy write Iuducum vndecimo. That there was a leder
and a Judge of gods people / whose name was Iept. And when he should go for to
fight against gods enemies the people of Amon / he made his vow to god that
if he gave to him y^ vyctory of his enemies / when he came home again what living
thing he met first of his household in his coming home / he should slay it
and offer it up to god in sacrefyce. After this as god would he had the vyctory
and came home with great worship / when his daughter herd these tidings she
was full glad and took her timber in her hand and came in gre^e haste first
of all the household dau^synge playnge and singing against her fader for to
welcome hy^ home. When Iept saw his daughter so coming against him / he
bethought him of his auowe yt he had made and bycame full heavy / for he had no
childern but her / and he loved her full well. Alas daughter alas said he /
what haste thou done / why come thou so soon against me. I have opened my
mouth to god and have made a vow against the / for I must by my auowe slay the
and offer the up in to sacrefyce to god. But the woman his daughter yet clean
maiden was so glad of gods worship and of her faders worship / and that
gods enemies were so slain / that she made little sorrow or none for her
death and said to her fader Iept Sythen you haste made such a vow, and god has
sent the vyctorye of his enmyes / fulfylle thy vow / for I take the death
gladdly. But I pray the of one boon er I deye. Let me go with other maidens
my playferes and morn and bewail my maydenhode among the hills and the
mountains two months. For it was that time repreef to a woman to deye
without issue of her body. And Iept granted her bone. After two months /
she came again to her fader Iept / and mekely suffered the death for gods sake
and for the love of her fader. And thus my friends byle^e that yt womans death
which was a clean maiden betokens Crystes passion. For right as she took the
death wylfully for saluaco^n of gods folk / and destrucco^n of gods
enemies. So Christ a clean maiden yt never was defouled with sin / and never
did amys / he suffered wylfully bitter death for salvation of all mankind and
destrucco^n of the fendes power. Dives. Was not his vow lefull. Pauper. It was
not lefull. For by his vow if he had first met with a catte or an hounde
coming against him / he should have made sacrefyce to god thereof / which
sacrefyce should have been abhomynaco^n to god / for neither was able to be
offered in sacrefyce. And for as much as he made his vow so unwisely / god
suffered hy^ to fall in to that myschyef to slay an Innocent his own daughter
against gods law. For god says Innocente^ et iustu^ no^ occides. Thou shall
not slay the Innocent ne ye right full man ne woman. And so by his vow so
folysly made he did full great dedely sin / and forfeted full hyghely against
gods law. And therefore says the maystre of the stories and Josephus also
that he was a fool in his vow making and wicked and over cruelly done in the
fulfyllynge. And therefore says the great clerk Ysydorus in Synonimis li.ij.
et.xxij. q^.iiij In malis promissis rescinde fidem. in turpi voto muta
decretu^. quod incaute nouisti ne facias. impia est promissio que scelere
adimpletur. In wicked byhestes cut away the faith / that is to say /
fulfill no wicked byhestes / keep no faith for to do amys. For in shrewed
byhestes it is better to be holden false than true / for who so fulfylleth them
is false to god In the vow says he that is foul and unlawful change thy dome
/ and that that thou haste not wisely auowed do it not. For it is a wicked
byheste that is fulfilled and done with sin.

Caplm.iiij.
Dives. I assente / say forth I pray the. Pauper. Also gods name is taken
in vain by blasphemye and spytefull speech of god / as when that men grutche
against gods domes in sickness trybulacyons and disease / and say that god
is unrightful and cruel or grutched against his mercy when they may not have
vengeance of their adversaries as they would have it / and say that god is to
pacyent and to mercyable. And they also that fallen in wanhope / sayen that god
will not forgive them their sin. And they also that presume to much of
gods mercy and will not amend them for they say that god will forgive it
them at the first word. Also some say that god slepeth when he helps
them not as they would have it All they that speak thus or say any other
thing of god and that is against his worship and his godhode / they take gods
name in vain by blasphemy Also gods name is taken amys and in vain by evil
speech of oaths swetynge. For who so will lightly swear for a thing of naught
or of no charge / or customably or falsely / and wot well that he swereth
false / or dyspyteously / or dysceyuable / or swereth by any creatures / or
uses any nyce oaths / or unlawful oaths / all these take gods name in vain.
For there ought no man ne woman to swear but for a treuthe of charge / and
when it needs for to swear to witness of treuthe. And when a man shall swear
he shall swear by his god and by no creature. Dives. Much folk is so brought
in custom of swerynge / that uneath they can speak three words togydre but
they swear by god or by some creature / or some great or nyce oath. Pauper. As
I said by fore wicked custom excuses not sin but it accuses and aggregeth
sin. And therefore it is to dread yt they yt swear so customably and so
lightly that they sin dedely if they swear soth or false. And therefore
Solomon says. Iuracioni ne assuescas os tuu^. and^. Eccle. xxiij. Let not thy
mouth says he be uses to swerynge / for many hard happes and fallynges ben
in such swerynge. And name not to often says he gods name with thy mouth in
swerynge / ne be not vsaunt in swerynge to meddle the with saints names / for
if thou do thou shalt not be clear of fool swerynge / ne clear of sin. For
what man says he yt swereth much / he shall be fulfilled with sin and
shrewednesse / and trybulaco^n and disease shall not pass fro him and his
household For god says that who so takes his name in vain / he shall not
pass un punysshed. Such swerynge and despysynge of gods name is so horrible
a sin in gods sight / that as Solomon says in y^ same book the xxvij. ca.
When that men herd such swerynge / the here of their hedes should arise for
dread / and they should stop their eres and not here such yrreuerence and
despyte of gods name. Loquela multu^ iura^s horriplicacione^ capiti statuit.
et irreuerencia illius obturacio aurium.

Caplm.v.
Dives. Folk now a days in three manners excuse them of swerynge. Some say
that they swear so often for y^ love that they have to god for to have him often
in mind. Some say why may not I swear for I swear soth. Some say but I swear
there will no man believe me. Pauper. These ben no excusaco^ns but grievous
accusaco^ns and grutchynges of sin. For as for y^ first point it is false /
for such false swerers love not their god / for they keep not his
commandment / and they have him full little in mind / and swear many
horrible oaths in vanyte and shrewednesse because of mysuse when they think
not on god / and therefore that excusaco^n is but an open scorn and a great
blasphemynge to god. For if thy servant had done a thing that thou had
him forboden / the ofter that he did it the worse thou woldeste be paid. And
if he scorned the and said that he did it for thy love for to have y^ in mind
/ thou would hold it a full great scorn and ben much more an angered with
him / namely if thou ware his lyege lord and his king. Much more than god
that is lord and king of all things is an angered with them that so swear
ayenste his commandment / and excuse them so scornfully saying yt they do it
to have god in mind. And therefore it is for to dread yt they shall be put out of
mind among gods chosen people / for Christ complayneth him of such folk
to his fader in heaven / and says thus Qm^ que^ tu percussisti persecuti su^t.
et super dolore^ vulner^ meorum addideru^t. Fader in heaven says he for asmoche
as these wicked swerers have pursued and smyten him with their wicked tongues
that thou sendeste to suffer death for saluaco^n of mankind / and put new
sorrow above the sorrow and the bitter pains of my wounds that I suffered for
her sin and their sake / therefore fader put to them sin to sin / that
is to say / let them fall fro sin to sin / and let them not enter in
to thy rightwysnesse for to be saved. Put them out of the book of life from
among them that shall be in bliss without end. Let them not be written
with the rightwysse folk that shall be saved. These ben Crystus words
complanynge him to y^ fader in heaven of such foul swerers. p^o.lxviij. Dives.
It seems herby that such sweryng is fulgrete horrible sin and full
peryllous. But what say you of the second excusaco^n. Pauper. We ben bound
never to lie and nothing to say but soth. Nevertheless we be not bound to
say all the sothes / ne we ought not to swear for every soth that we speak. For
as says saint Thomas de veritate theology. Both he that forswereth him
against the treuthe / and he that swereth with the treuthe without great cause
both they take gods name in vayn For he that forswereth wyttyngly the name of
sovereign treuthe yt is god and despyseth it / and he that swereth with out
great cause he takes his name in idleness / for he swereth without good cause
and when him needs not / and so both little or naught set by gods name /
and so they take it in vain.

Caplm.vi.
Dives. In how many causes is it lefull to swear. Pauper In.vij. cases clerks
and lewd folk may swear lefully. First for to save man or woman from harm
of their body / and fro lesynge of his good when y^ treuthe can none other
wise be preued. Also for confyrmaco^n of peace. Also for to keep faith and
treuthe among mankind. Also for to keep obedyence and ordynall subgeccyon of
the subgettes to their soueraynes. Also for to save fredom of holy church.
Also for purgacyon and salvation of man's name and of his fame. Also for
assoylynge from a curse. Extra.li.i. de elect. significasti. And in every oath
men must have three things / which ben treuthe / dome / and rightwysnesse. As
says the prophet Ieremye. iiij. For who so shall swear he must have treuthe
in his conscience / that he wot well yt he swereth treuthe / for if he be not
syker / but only weneth to be syker / he shall not swear yt it is so / but that
he weneth that it is so as he says. Also he must have with him dome / that is
a good and a dyscrete auyseme^t er he swear / that he swear not but treurhe /
and for need that he to whom he swereth will not else believe him in things
of charge that is prouffytable to be byleued but he swear. Also he must have
rightwysnesse / that the thing that he swereth for / and the manner of sweryng
be rightful honest and lefull. Extra. li.ij. de iure iurando. Et si xp^s.
Dives. I would feign flee such oaths / but as I said first / men will not
bylene me but I swear. Pauper. If it be a treuthe of charge right profitable to
be byleued / and men will not believe the for thy simple word / than it is leful
to y^ to swear as I have said But if it be a thing of no charge nenedefull /
swear you not. For if thou use the to swear commonly for a thing of naught thou
synnest grievously and make other of wanbyleue yt they should no more believe
the for thyn oath than they do without oath / and wise men will the less believe
the for thyn oaths For commonly great swerers and vsaunt swerers ben full false.
Dives. Why so. Pauper. For in that they take gods name so vain / they ben
false to god in their swerynge. And sythen they ben false to god in their
swerynge / they give little tale for to be false to man or woman in their
swerynge / or to begyle them with oaths. And therefore if you wylt that men
believe the by ye or nay / use the to speak truly dyscretly and flee oaths. And
so worship gods name and be true to god in byeng and selling / in speech and
in living. And than men should believe the redely without any oath Do so and
speak of that than men may hold the a true man / and than men shall believe
the by ye and nay / better than other with their greter oaths And if thou be
varyenge and untrusty in thy word and in thy deed / men will neither believe y^
by oath neither without oath. Dives. Therefore some say that Christ forbade all
manner sweryng / when hae said in his gospel. Ego aute^ dico vobis no^ iurare
oino. Mathei.v. I say to you that ye swear in no wise. Pauper. That is not the
English of Crystus word. But this is the English. I say to you that ye
swear not in any manner / that is to say for no manner cause not lightly ne
customably. Also he badde by tho words that men should not swear by creatures
/ as for wytnes neither by heaven for it is gods trone. Ne by earth for it is
the stole under his fete. Ne by Ierlm for it is the cite of the great king. Ne
by thine head / for thou canste not make one of thyn here is white ne black.
Let your word be ye ye / nay nay. Mathei v. Dives. Must we than say twyes
ye and twyes nay. Pauper. That you must if you wylt be true. For the same ye that
thou sayste with thy mouth / you must say it with thyn heart / for thy mouth
and thyn heart must accord togydre. For if thou say ye with thy mouth / and
nay with thyn heart / you art false and doste against Crystus lore. Dives. Yet
Contra te. Saint James says Ante oi^a fre^s mei nolite iurare and^. Iacobi.v.
Before all things my leave brethern will ye not swear / neither by heaven ne by
earth / ne by any other oath whereby it seems that it is not lefull to swear.
Pauper. Saint James forbedeth us not utterly to swear / but he byddeth that men
should be in no will to swear any oath / for men should not swear but for need.
Dives. Yet Contra te. Christ byddeth in the gospel Mathei.v. That our word
should be ye ye / nay nay. Quoth aute^ his habundancius est. a malo est. For what
is more than this in speech it is full evil / whereby it seems that if men say
more than ye or nay by oaths swerynge they do amys. Pauper. Christ said not
that it was evil to say more than ye or nay or to swear when it needs. But
he said it is full evil that men swear and say more than ye or nay / for it
comes of wanbyleue of him that will not believe his even christian but he swear.
Also it comes of falshede of the people / that much people is so false / that
uneath men may believe them without oath / or by oath Dives. Where fyndeste you
that god badde men swear / or that it is leful for to swear. Pauper. In the
gospel that you allegest against me. Mathei. v. where Christ says thus. Reddes
dn^o iuramenta tua. Thou shall yield to thy lord god thyn oaths. That is to
say you shall swear by him and by none other. And therefore he says Deuteronomy.vi.
Thou shall dread thy lord god and serve him allone / and swear by his name.

Caplm.vij.
Dives. Why forbedeth Christ men for to swear by creatures Pauper. There is two
manner of swerynge. One is taking of witness of a thing that a man swereth by
/ and so it is not lefull for to swear by any creature. For saint Poule says.
Hoi^es per maiore^ suu^ iurant. ad Hebre.vi. Men swear says he by their more /
that is to say by him that is more of credence and of reverence than they ben
them self. But only god is more in dygnyte and more in order of kind than man
/ for he is both god and man. And therefore he will that we take in swerynge no
witness but only of him / for he is sovereign treuthe. And therefore such
manner swerynge is a dyuyne worship that longs oonly to god and to no
creature. For god will that when men may have no witness of treuthe that is
needful and prouffytable to be byleued / that they take him to witness and
swear by him as by sovereign treuth and by no creature. For such manner
swerynge is a dyuyne worshypp that longs to god and to no creature. As the
gloss says Mathei. v. super illud. Non periurabis. And as saint Austyn says
in the same place. Who so swereth by any creature / he swereth by god that made
yt creature. And therefore Christ badde y^ men should swear by no creatures /
for if they do lightly they fall in double sin / both in ydolatry and in
perjury. First in ydolatry for the worship that longs only to god / they do
it to creatures. Also they fall of^e so in perjury / for men dread less to
lie and to forswere them when they swear by creatures / than when they swear by
god allone.

Caplm.viij.
AN other manner swerynge is by execracyon and imprecaco^n / that is when man or
woman in their swerynge prays openly or pryuely against him self / or against
any thing that he loves / or any other thing but it be as he says. And thus
some man swereth by his head / some man by his thedame. For as saint Austyn
says / he that swereth so he byndeth him self and leyeth his head and his
thedame in plegge to god / and prays to god that he leese his head and his
thedame and never thryue but it be as he says / or but he do as he says or
behoteth. Some swear by their soul / by their chaffre and by all the goods
that they have / and so bind them to lose their soul / their chaffre / and
all their goods / and bind their soul to the fire of hell without end but
it be as they say. Some swear by their fader and moders souls / and so as
much as they may they bind their fader and moders souls to the pains of
hell without end but it be as they say / or but they do as they byhoten.
Some in their swerynge pray openly against themself / as when they say so
help me god. There they forsake the help of god but it be as they say. Some
say else the devil brenne me / god give me else myschau^ce / and such
other. And of this manner swerynge is that solemn oaths that men make in dome
and out of dome / when men say / so help me god at the holy dome / or else
so help me god and the holy dome. In this oath men forsake the help of god
and of our lady / and of all the company of heaven at the day of dome but it be
so as they say. And over that if they swear false they call god to witness
of a thing that is false / and sayen that god whose name is treuth bears them
witness of a thing that is false. And so they lie on god and do him great
velonye / for he was never false witness ne never shall be. For he is
sovereign treuthe that not dysceyueth / ne may not be dysceyueth. And that
shall these false swerers feel at the day of dome but they amend them. Dives.
Why lay men their hondes on the book when they shall swear before a Judge.
Pauper. For that men should charge their oath the more / for when he lays his
hand on the book / he forsakes all the faith of holy church / and all the
holy prayers written in the book but it be as he says. Also he forsakes all
the Joys of heaven written in the book / and byndeth him to all the pains
written in the book but it be as he says. And in that he lays his hand on
the book in his swerynge / he forsakes all the good deeds that ever he did
or ever he shall do but it be sothe that he swereth. For in holy write by the
hondes ben vnderstonden works. And that he swereth so with his mouth / and
kysseth the book / he forsakes all holy prayers and good words that ever he
spoke with his mouth or ever shall speak but if it be as he says / and but he
swear soth. And if he forswere him with his mouth / he makes it vnnable to
resceyue the holy sacrament of the aultre / that is Christ him self sovereign
treuthe under form of bread.

Dives. What sayste thou of them that though they swear soth / yet in slyghe
or safte words they dysceyue their even christian which understand them not.
Pauper. Such be forsworen. For in two manners a man may be forsworen in
swerynge soth. First if he swear soth in begylynge words and slyghe for to
begyle his even christian. For as Ysydorus says.xxij.q^. quinta Quacu^que. What
craft or saying ever thou use in thy speech and in thine oaths for to
dysceyue thyn even christian / god that knows thyn thought and thy conscience /
takes it not as thou menest / but as he understands it / to whom thou
swerest so in dysceyte. And as he says thou do double sin so swerynge /
for both you take gods name in vain / and also thou dysceyuest thyn even
christian. Dives Tell me some example. Pauper. We find in the life of saint
Nycholas / that a Jew lent a christian man a great sum of gold unto a
certain day / and took no sykernesse of him but his faith and saint Nycholas
to borowe. The day passed and the christian man paid not / wherefore the Jew
challenged his gold of ye christian man before a Judge / for he said falsely that
he had paid him. When the Judge should sytte on the cause / the christian man
bethought him to begyle and feigned him seek and came lenyng on a staff before
the Judge / in which staff he had put all the gold that he ought to the Jew
and more thereto / for the staff was holowe. As he should lay his hand on the
book / he took the Jew the staff in his hand prayeng him to hold it whiles
he made his oath. The Jew thought of no gyle / but took the staff to hold as
he prayed hy^ And than the false christian man laid his hand on the book and
made his oath in this manner. By god and saint Nicholas and so help me god at
the holy dome I took the all y^ money that thou chalengest and more thereto /
and he said soth / for he had taken it him that time in the staff. The Jew
was wroth and said to him. Now as trewely as you haste forsworen the by god and
saint Nycholas. I pray god and saint Nycholas that was thy borowe that hard
vengeance come to the. The christian man took his staff again of the Jew and
went again homewarde lenynge on his staff. There fell such an heaviness of
sleep on him yt he laid him down in the way to sleep a lytyl from the cite
where he had made his oath / and laid the staff with the gold fast besides
him. There came a carte and went upon him and slew him and brake his staff
till the gold scatered all about. Anon the people and the Jew also ran for
to see what was fallen. And when they saw the staff broken / and the gold
so scatered about / than they knew how gylfully he had sworen / and thanked
god and saint Nycholas that the treuthe was so tried and showed. The Jew gave
that gold to the poor folk and bycame a christian man. Dives. This ensample is
open. Now I see that gylefull oaths ben full peryllous. Say forth I pray the.
Pauper. Also a man may be forsworen sweryng soth vnwyttyngly and weneth to
swear false for to dysceyue his even christian. As if I swore to an other that it
were not day to dysceyue him and let him of his Journey / wenynge my self
that it were day all though it were not day but far from day / yet I were
forsworen. As the law shows well xxij. q^.ij.c.^.i. Also if a man swear a
treuth with a blasphemye of gods name. As if he swore by gods body heart.
eyes. wou^des. or any such other if he be used thereto he is forsworen / be it
soth or false that he swereth.

Caplm.x.
Wherefore my friend ye shall understand that in.vi. manners a man is forsworen.
First if he swear against his conscience / as wha^ he swereth false wyttyngly
though he do it for dread. Also if he swear any thing unlawful and against
charity / as if he swear to slay a man or defoule a woman with his body / or
yt he shall never do alms to poor men / ne come in his neighbors house.
Also if man do against his oath which is lefull though he do it for dread of
death if the oath turn to none evil end Also if he swear treuth for dysceyte
and gyle as I said now late. Also if he swear unwisely / as says Durandus in
su^ma sua. Extra. de iureiurando c.^ Sicut. et c.^ tua. And if he do it with
auysement or vsau^tly it is dedely sin. And he says there that every oath
made unwisely is periurye. Also if he compelle an other to swear wyttynge well
that he will forswere him. As the law shows well.xxij.q^.iiij. Inter cetera.
And saint Austyn also (...) sermon that he makes of the decollacyon of saint
Johan baptyste / where he t^^leth. That on a time a good simple true man had
lent a certain money to a false man / which forsook it and said that he
lent him none / wherefore the true man provoked him to swear / knowing well
that he would forswere him and so he did / and the true man lost his money.
And the night following the true man thought that he stood before a great Judge
/ which said to him in this wise. Why dydeste you that man swear sythen thou
wyste well that he should forswere him. Lord said he for he denied me my good.
Than the Judge said to him. It had be better to the for to have lost thy good /
than to slay his soul that god boughte so dear with his precious blood. And
anon he did him beat full hard and sore / in so much that when he awoke
his back appyred full of wou^des and all to beten full black and blew. But
when he repented him and axed mercy / his sin was forgyuen him.

Caplm.xi.
Dives. It might well be so / for both took gods name in vain and did
dyspyte thereto / the swerer in that that he forswore him wyllyngly and
wyttyngly / and he that made him swear. For wyllyngly and wyttyngly he did him
forswere and despise gods name / and so he assented to ^eriury. And by the
law both he that does the sin / and he that assenteth thereto ben gylty of
the sin and ben worthy the same pain. But I pray the what say thou of
them that swear so dyspytefully and horrybly by gods body / heart / blood
and such other. Pauper. That manner swerynge is open blasphemye and great
despyte to god. And if a man or a woman be used thereto / swear he soth or swear
he false / he synneth dedely. For not only such take gods name in vain /
but also in great despyte. And therefore it is forboden by the law.xxij.q^ i.
Si quis per capillu^ There should noman swear by the here of Christ / ne by his
head / ne by no part of Christ / ne use such blasphe mye against god in any
manner wise. And if he did / but he would cesse and amend him / and if he were
a man of holy church he should be deposed and degraded. And if he were a lewd
man / he should be acursed and pursued by censure of holy church till he would
amend him. And by the law Imperyall as the gloss says there / such foul
swerers should be punysshed with the vttrest pain and torment save death. And
therefore in Almayne such folk ben punysshed shamefully and in diverse
co^trees. And therefore in tho contrees ben used none oaths / but it be before a
Judge or else for great need. There is in their speech as y^ gospel techeth /
ya and nene / that is ye or nay in English. And they keep more treuth for ya
and nene / than we do with all our great oaths that we now use in this land.
Of such foul swerers speaks Saint Poule saying that as much as in them is
they do gods sone often on the cross / and make but a Iape and scorn of his
passion. Rursum crucifigentes sibimetipsis filiu^ dei et ostentui.i. irrisioni
habentes. ad Hebre.vi. For they can not speak to an unreasonable best / but
they all to rent Christ with their oaths / and night and day repreue Christ
of his shameful death that he suffered for their sin and their sake. And there
that they ought to take most matter to love him and to worship him / they take
most occasyon of unkindness to despise him. For had not he deyed the bitter
death and shamfull for our gylte our sin and our sake / we should never else
have sworen by gods death / and had he not wept salt teerys with his eyes
for our sake and not for his own / we should never else have sworen by gods
eyes. And had he not be percyd to the heart and shed his precious heart blood
to wasshe us from our sins / we should never ellis have sworen by gods
heart / ne by gods blood. And had he not suffered the deep wou^des and bitter
pains in his body and in his bones to save us from the pains of hell / we
should never else have sworen by his wou^des / his body / his bones / ne his
blood. And also against the endless love that he showed to us / we show him
great unkindness / and against the great worship that he did to us and brought
us to endless worship we do to him over great velonye. We find in y^ miracles
of our lady that sometime there was a ryghtfull Judge demynge / but full gylty in
such oaths swerynge. Somdele he was devout to our lady and grette her every
day with a certain Auees / wherefore our lady by night appyred to him and
showed hy^ a child all blody. The eyes were put out of y^ head and henge down
by the chekys / the heart was rent out of the body / and henge a down by the
side / and the body was all to corn and to wrappyd in blood. Than she said to
him. Thou art a Judge give me now a ryghtfull dome / what is that man worthy to
have that thus has arrayed my child. The Judge answered and said. He is worthy
to be hanged by the neck in the fire of hell without end. Than our lady
answered to him. Forsothe thou art the same man. For I had never no child
but this allone / which was borne of my body for salvation of all mankind.
And thou as much as in the is haste put out his eyes / when thou sworest by
gods eyes / and thou rentest out his heart when thou sworest by gods heart
/ thou have all to rent him with thine foul oaths. And therefore amend the /
or you shalt have the same dome that thou haste given and shalt be hanged by
the neck in the fire of hell without end.

Caplm.xij.
Dives. What sayste thou of them that swear by the cock instead of god / some
by god and by the holy dome / some by laken some by our lady / some by cocks
body / some by their hode / and some by their tytpat and cap / and many such
other nyce oaths that men use now these days. Pauper. If they swear any such
oaths for to begyle their even christian that understand them not / they sin
dedely and ben also forsworen. And for to couple or knytte to gydre god and the
holy dome in swerynge / in ernest / or in game / it is a full grievous sin /
and great despyte and scorn to gods name. And if they swear such oaths not
for dysceyte / but for to flee gretter oaths / yet they sin full grievously if
they ben used thereto / for they do against Crystus commandment that byddeth us
swear by no creature / ne to swear but for great need and prouffyte and else
not but outward should be ye ye / nay nay And if a man be compelled to swear
he shall swear by his god and by none such nyce oaths. Moreover my friend when
that a man swereth by his cap / or by his hode / or by any such other / either
he swereth so by way of witness taking or by way of execraccyon. If he
swear so by way of witness taking he does himself foul velony / for he
makes his hode of more worship and of more credence than himself. For as
saint Poule says / there should no man swear for witness taking / but by his
more and by his better. And he offends god full hyghely / for the worship
that longs only to god he does it to his hode. For as swerynge to bear
witness is a dyuyne worship that longs only to god. And if he swear by his
hode by way of execracyon / so that he must lose his hode but he say soth /
it is an over scornful oath / for it is no great loss a man to lose his hode
for to win an hundred pound Dives And yet such ben more true of their word
than other that swear gretter oaths. Pauper. Sometime it is so. For the fend
tempts them less / and to the less sin for to hold them stylle in y^
gretter / and so to draw other to the same sin yt they perceive it not. For
it is more sin to rob god of his worship / than to rob a man of his
catell. But such as swear by their hode do dyuyne worship to there hode and
take it from god / and make other to do more worship to their hode than to
gods holy name. And often such swerers keep treuth in small things and common
to dysceyue men in greter thyngis of more charge. And therefore I pray the use
not such nyce oaths / but let thy word be ye ye / nay nay / as Christ
byddeth it / so that it be said with meekness and reverence. And if you need
to say more / say ye truly / nay truly / or sykerly or sothly / for that
manner of speech is none oath. For it is not else to say / but I say ye truly
and not falsely. I say ye sykerly and not dysceyuably / and use none oaths but
you be compelled by thy sovereign / or for a thing of charge / and men shall
believe well by thy ye ye / and by thy nay nay / without any more.

Caplm.xiij.
Dives. Is it not more sin a man for to swear by god / than by his hode.
Pauper It is more sin. For the holyer that a thing is that man swereth by /
the greter is the sin and the periurye / as the law says. And it is more
sin a man for to forswere him by god than by creatures / or by false gods
or mawmettes. And thou if you swear by any oath or by any creature that is not
lefull to swear by / thou synneste grievously if thou swear soth or swear false.
But yet perjury by god is more sin than by any creature. Dives If a man swear
by his hode / is he bounden to keep his oath. Pauper He is if his oath be
lefull and spedefull / or else he does sin to sin. As the law
says.xxij.q^.i. Mouet te. Dives. Is it lefull for a christian man for to take an
oath of an hethen man that swereth by his false gods Pauper. It is lefull if
he may none other sykernesse have of him. But it is not lefull to a christian man
for to styre him so to swear. Example we have of this Gen^.xxxi. Where Laban
swore to Jacob by his false gods. Dives. When servants ben sworen to their
lord that they shall be true to him and warn him for his harms / ben they
bound to tell him all the myschyues false deeds and velonyes that is done to
the lord in household or out of household if they know them. Pauper. If the
lord be fell cruel and baratous or suspecte against the person that is gylty.
I trow the servant by that oath is not bound to tell the lord thereof for
to accuse the person / for also his oath is vn^^full. For so in keeping of his
oath he should bring the lord to grievous sin. And therefore he should not
have made that oath at the beginning / for it was semely yt much disease
might come thereof if it were kept. Nathelesse if that servant that so swore
knew any thing berynge or taking away or wastyng the lords good that he
has in keeping / he ought to warn his lord thereof / but if he can the more
peasybly have it again / and save his lords prouffyte. And every servant is
bounden to warn his lord of the harm that is done to his lord in his office
for good faith and salvation of his own person / if it can not else peasybly
be redressed. And if any other defaultes yt touchen not his office / if he can
preue them / he is bound to tell them to his lord if his lord is pacyent
and reasonable and not to cruel / and if he can not preue them / he is not
bound to tell them. As the law shows full well.xxxv. q^.vi. Ep^s in
synodo. et.ij.q^.i. Si peccauerit. et.q^.vij. Pleru^que.vi.q^.ij. Si tm^. For
if the servant when he made that oath thought to bind him to tell his lord
all the harms that he knew / and when he can not preue it / than his oath is
not lefull / and therefore it byndeth not. Every servant is bounden by his oath
and by his faith to be true to his lord and warn him of his harm and of his
velonye in common manner but he is not bound for to accuse in special but if he
can preue it / but it be full preuely to such one that will prouffyte to the
person and not harm him ne defame him / but only amend him. For by accusynge
in special but if the playnt can be preued it makes hate / fighting /
manslaughter dyffamacyon / and great disease.

Caplm.xiiij.
Dives. When a comunyte or a college swereth for them and their successors to
do or to keep a certain thing in time coming / if their successors do it
not / neither keep not their couenaunte / ben not their successors forsworen.
Pauper. Nay. For that oath byndeth the persons that swore it and not their
successors / as for perjury. Nevertheless the successors ben bounden by good
faith for to do and for to keep that their predecessors bound them to so
swerynge / if it were lefull and if they have the same prouffytes thereof that
their predecessors had. Extrahe veritatis. et Ray.li. pri.^ ti. de periurio.
Item pone Dives. If a man make an oath to an other man / may not that other man
yt he makes it to unbind him from that oath and forgive it him Pauper And if
it be so that yt oath be made pryncypally in favor of gods worship / the
man that he made it to can not assoyle him ne unbind hy^ from that oath / ne
none other may but by chau^gynge in to some better thing / but need or vnpower
excuse him. If the oath be made pryncypally in the favor of the man that he
swereth it to / that man may well unbind him fro his oath. And if he made yt
oath in favor of an other man / only that other man may unbind him from that
oath / but any condyco^n put in the oath let it. As I swore to the that I
should give thy fader.x. shelynges you myghtest not unbind me fro yt oath but
thy fath might well unbind me thereof. Dives. Whether is a man harder bound by
auowe or by an oath Pauper. The auowe byndeth harder. For our auowe byndeth us
by our faith and treuth that we owe to god to pay to him our byhestes. Our
oath bind us pryncypally for to be true to our even christian for the reverence
of gods holy name. As says Iohe^s in su^. con.li.i.ti.ix.q^.xiiij. quero.
Dives. If a man or a woman have do any dedely sin / of which he is shreuen
and contryte / may he swear sykerly that he is not gylty of that sin for to
avoid sclaundre of himself and of his friends / and of other that will not
believe him in that but he swear. Pauper. For asmoche as he knows not sykerly
yt he is suffycyently contryte / he is not syker whether his sin is forgyuen
him or not. And therefore he should for no myschyef swear so folysly. Much more
he should not swear it of his own profer when him needs not to swear. In su^.

Caplm.xv.
Dives. What is auowe proprely. Pauper. Auowe is byhotynge of some good thing
made to god with auysement. As Raymunde says. Dives. When a man or woman in
anguysshe and disease makes auowe to be helped / ben they not bounden to
fulfill yt auowe though anguysshe and disease brought them thereto. Pauper. Yes
forsooth if they thought on the cause when they made it / and than vere in
purpose to bind them if they had their desire and help in yt need / so yt by
keeping of their auowe they ben better dysposed to keep gods commandments /
for thereto should all common auowes deserve. And the wife that in peril of
child beryng or of other sekenes makes auowe all if she ought none to make
without leave of her husbonde / yet she ought not to do against that auowe by
her own dome / ne without dome of her sovereign if she feel her helped by the
auowe. Nevertheless I trow that her husbonde may unbind her therfro / and
her confessor also / by chau^gynge in to some other good deed / and namely if
the keeping of the auowe should turn in to preiudyce of yt husbonde / or
lettynge of the better deed. For wives ought not to make great auowes that
should be in disease and preiudyce of their husbonde Ne childern within age /
should make none auowe without assente of their fader or of their tutour. Ne
the seruau^te in preiudyce or hyndryng of his lord or of his maystre. And if
he do / his lord or maystre may revoke it / and so may the fader the childs /
and the husbonde the wives. Other. auowes that been not preiudyce to the
husbonde the wife may it / as to say certain bedes. But of no great
pylgremage / ne of great abstynence / ne of contynence / ne to give great
alms / but if her husbonde is evil dysposed in his wits / or not ruled of
custom by reason. For if her husbonde have no pity of nedy people than she may
make auowe to give to poor people to yt pleasau^ce of god after her power
saving their both astate. Dives. Whether is it more medefull to do a good
deed with auowe or without auowe. Pauper. With auowe / for a vow making is
one of the highest worship that man may do. Quia est actus latrie. Also by
auowe man meketh him most to god / and gives to god the most gift that he
can give that is his free will. Also he gives a greter gift that gives the
tree with fruit / than he that gives the fruit and reserueth to him the
tree. Also by a vow man's will is more stabled in goodness. Nevertheless for
as much as man and woman ben full frail and chau^geable / therefore men should
not make auowes but few and with a good auysement. For brekynge of auowes is a
great dishonor to god. Dives. What if a man make a vow oonly under condyco^n.
Pauper. If the condyco^n fall or be / he is bound / else not. And if a man
bind him by diverse causes / if there one fall he is bounden though the other
fallen not. As if I made any auowe for to go to saint James in hope to find
there my brother / and also to have redempco^n of my sins / though I wyste
afterward certainly ye I should not find my brother there / yet I were bound
to go thither for y^ other cause. Dives. For how many causes is a man or woman
vnbou^de from his auowe. Pauper. For four causes. First if the pryncypall
cause of his auowe making fail. As if a man make auowe to fast all yt
satyrdayes to have health of his child / if the child amend not / he is not
bound thereto. Also if it be made under condycyon that is not ne falls not.
Also if his sovereign unbind him thereof. Also if he have no power for to keep
it. Dives. Than if a maiden make an auowe to live in maydenhode all her life
during / if she be corrupt and lose her mayde^hode / she is vnbou^de from her
auowe / for she can no longer live in maydenhode. Pauper. All if she can no
longer live in maydenhode / yet she is bound to contynence all her life / and
to keep her auowe in as much as she may. And so it is of other auowes that men
may not all do / for they ben bound to do all that they may do. Moreover ye
shall understand that some auowe is of need as the auowe that we make in bapty
me / for to forsake the fend / and to keep the faith of holy church. And
other auowes of free will / as when a man byndeth him freely to do a good deed
without which he may be saved / as fasting / contynence / and pylgremage. Two
things be needful in chaungynge of auowe. Rightful cause / and auctoryte of
the souerayns. In dyspen sacyon of the auowe of abstynence or such other / it
must be taken head to the richesses or to the pouerte of y^ person. For a
poor man in caas ought to have as much dyspensaco^n for a penny or for right
naught / as a great lord for an hundred mark. Some condyco^ns ben
vnderstonden in auowes though a man say them not / as I shall do if I live and
if god will. Other condico^ns ben more specyal / as I shall vysyte saint Thomas
if I go in to kent. By both manners of these condico^ns if they fail man in
excused of his auowe if it stand all in yt condyco^n. The husbonde may not
enter in to relygyon / but his wife make first auowe of perpetuell co^tynence.
Neither the wife ne ye husbonde may make auowe of co^tynence without others
assente. Solemn auowe of co^tynence lets matrymony to do or to be done. If
it be not solemn / if the person wedde yt matrymony holds He must pay
the debt of his body to his wife / but he may not axe it of her. Solemn
auowe is made by taking of holy order / or by enter in to relygyon. Though a
man or woman break his fast because of sickness / he breketh not his
abstyne^ce. Extra li.v. de regulis iuris. quoth non est licitu^.

Dives. What if a man or woman swear a thing in hastynesse / which oath they
would not have sworen if they had auysed them. Pauper. If their oath be a
mean to keep the better gods commandment / and to flee thereby more sin
and love god the more / they be bound to keep this oath / and not else Dives.
If childern swear to do a thing leful while they be within age may their fader
and mother revoke that oath. Pauper. Fader and mother and his tutour may revoke
the childerens oaths and their vows as soon as they know thereof. And so may
the husbonde of his wife / and she is bound to obey his reuocaco^n. But if
they go forth when they wot thereof. and revoke it not at the beginning /
afterward they may not by the law revoke it / ne the fader the childs oath
ne the vow. Dives. I suppose they revoke it afterward. Pauper. Both the wife
to the husbonde / and the child to the fader while he is within age ought to
obey. Auyse him of the peril that so reuoketh.

Caplm.xvij.
Dives. whether is perjury more sin or manslaughter. Pauper. Perjury is more.
For as saint Poule says ad Hebr.vi. Men should swear by their better and their
gretter / and of every contrauersy / that is to say of every cause that is in
debate to conferme the true part / the last end is an oath. For every such
cause is termyned and ended by an oath. And sythen it is so that the cause of
manslaughter and of every open sin touching man's dome must be termyned by
an oath. Periurye must be taken for a passing sin and so it is. For who
so forswereth him wyttyngly he forsakes his god and therefore perjury is the
gretest sin of all sins next ydolatrye / for it is against the second
commandment / and inmedyatly against god / and in despyte and forsakyng of
god. But manslaughter is inmedyatly against man. And though man with
manslaughter grieved god full sore / yet he forsakes not god ne despyseth hy^ /
ne dyshonoureth him so much as he does by perjury. And as yt phylosophre
says. In princi.^ meta.^ Among hethen men oath has ever be worshypfull. For
every sect Jew Sarasyn Paynym flees to swear falsely by his gods name as
most inconuenyent / and if ma^slaughter were more sin than perjury / it were
but a folly to try the cause of manslaughter by an oath. For it is semely that
he that was not aferde to do the great sin of manslaughter / should little
dread to fall in yt sin of perjury if it were less. And thus says saint
Thomas in qo^e d qthlibe et Io. in su^.li.i. ti..q^.xxiiij. vtrum. Dives. If
all men charged perjury and false oaths as you do / many man had been hanged
and drawn and slain in otherwise that yet live and fare well. It is full hard
so lightly to slay a man with a word when his life may be saved with a word /
for a man costeth full much or he come to be a man. Pauper. Therefore men
should besyly flee periurye and false oaths. For there is no thing that causes
so much manslaughter and shedynge of blood as perjury does. Dives. She we me
that I pray the if thou can. Pauper. Solomon says Eccle.x. The kingdom is
fletted and changed fro nacyon to nacyon for wrongs / vnrightfulnes / and
despytes done to gods name in diverse gyles. But perjury is cause of all
false domes and wrongs / and of all unright fullness / cause of gyle and of
treason and of great dyspytes that been done to god and man. For as I said
first Every cause must be ended by witnesses or by questes / the which ben
sworen to say treuth / and also by a Judge which is sworen to god and to the
king for to deem rightful domes And if they that been charged for to say the
treuth give none answer to forswere them and to lie / they shall dysceyue the
Judge / and do him give a false dome. Such periurers rob men of their good /
and dyshereted much folk. They save strong thieves / and slay true men. Such
rob folk of their good name / such ben false to god / to the king / and to
prelates of holy church. Such ben cause that this land is in point to be
lost and to be changed to an other nacyon and in to a new tongue. And that
may not be without shedynge of much blood and manslaughter. And so perjury is
cause of much manslaughter. Also periurye is cause that we have so many
thieves and manquellers in this land / for they hope always to be saved by
perjury and falshode of questmongers yt for a lytyl good will forswere them.
And therefore in hope of perjury they ben so bold in their sin to rob slay
and brenne / for though they ben taken yet they hope to escape by perjury. And
if they were syker that there would no man ne woman forswere hy^ to save them /
they would never be so bold to sin / and all other should be y^ more aferde
to sin / if they wyste well that true dome should pass with out perjury.
Such sinful wretches as the prophet Ysaye says.xxiij. they have put their
hope all in lesynges and in proiury / and by lesynges falshode and perjury ben
they mayntened and not chasty sed. Also it is a sin against kind to save a
thief in dyspyte of god / whose name they forswere against his commandment.
For he byddeth that there should no man take his name in vain. Also he says.
Non suscipies vocem mendacij. nec iunges manu^ vt pro impio dicas falsu^
testimoniu^. Exo.xxiij. Thou shalt not take the voice of lesynges / ne Join
thyn hand in making of covenant to bear any false witness for the wicked
man to save them. Maleficos no^ pacieris viuere. Exodi.xxij. Thou shalt not
suffer wytches and open malefactors neither felones a live / but slay them in
chastysynge of other. Slay one and save many one. Also this is a sin against
kind and over great folly / a man to slay his own soul without end to save
a thief that never would do him a good turn / but always ready to rob hy^
and perauenture to slay hy^ when he may. It is a great folly to offend god by
perjury to plese a thief a manqueller that offends god and all the contree
Such ben like the Jews that saved Barrabam y^ strong thief and manqueller /
and slew sweet Ihesu sovereign treuth that never did amys And as holy
doctors tellen yt a man should rather suffer the most dyspytous death of body
than he should for swear him or do any dedely sin. Much more he should not
forswere him ne do no dedely sin to save a thieves life that god and lands
law command to slay. It fell late in this land that a Scotte appeled an
English man of high treason / when he should fight before a Judge in their
cause / the Judge as the manner is put them both to their oath / when the Scotte
should swear he said to the Judge. Lord I came not hyder to swear I came to
fight for my challenge was to fight / and thereto I am ready / but swear will I
not / for I made no challenge to swear The Judge said that but if he would swear
that his appele was true / else he should be taken as a co^uycte and a taynt
traitor / and be hanged and drawn without fighting. And so he was / for he
would not swear wyttynge well that his appele was false / and made only for
malice as he knowleched er ^e deyed. This man might have sworen / and happily
have had the better of his aduersarye and escaped the death with great
worshypp in this world. But yet he had lever to deye dyspytefully than for to
do dyspyte to gods name / to swear false thereby / and lever to deye bodily
than to do that perjury to god and slay his own soul. For he held it as it
is a gretter sin than manslaughter. And though he would avenge hy^ on man for
rancour of heart / yet on god he would not venge him by perjury. And so god
saved them both fro perjury and ma^slaughter and gave them grace to dey in
charity and make amends to god and man.

Dives. Sythen perjury is so great a sin. What pain is ordained thereto by
the law. Pauper. As the law says.xxij. q^..i. p^dicandu^. Asmoche penance
should be enjoined for perjury / as for manslaughter and auoutry. And they
should never more be taken to swear or to bear witness in any dome / but shall
be forsaken in every dome / as taynt false / and always suspecte of falhode.
And by lands laws in many contrees if they be taynt forswore^ before a Judge
they should be dyshereted for ever / and their houses be drawn down / their
wodes hewn down / their trees also man's hight above y^ ground / the
stocks stand stylle to endeles repreef of them and of al their kynrede. For
there is no sin so noyous to a royalme and to every comunyte as perjury is /
for yt is cause yt there may no sin be punysshed / ne malefactors ne felones
chastysed / ne wrongs redressed. Men of holy church should be degraded / and
lewd people accursed.xi. q^.i. Conspiracionu^.et c.^ Coniuracionu^. Al other
sins when they have done penance for their fynne and ben amended / they ben
by the law restored again to their same / so y^ they may bear witnesses in dome
/ and their oath ought to be resceyued. But periurers that been taynt shall
never be restored to their fame / ne be taken for witness / ne his oath
accepted in no dome. As says Hosti.li.ij. Ru. de testibus. Si ^s possit d.
excipit. et. ^. hoc ide^. Et extra li.ij. d testibus. c.^ ex perte. et.vi. q^.
i. Quicu^que. And if he be taynt forsworen before a Judge / he is not able to be
any prelate / either in holy church / or in the secularyte neither king ne
bishop / abbot ne pryour / prince ne duke / or any pryncypate of worship.
Dives. Why is periurye so hard punysshed by the law. Pauper. For the sin is
over grievous and over much hau^ted and for it is most openly against the
substance of treuth and witness / and most maynteneth falshode / and lets
most treuth and rightwysnesse. As says the same clerk Hostyensis in the same
place. Such periurers may say that is written Ysaye.lix. Concepimus et locuti
sumus de cord verba mendacij and^. We have conceived false contryuynges / and
we have spoken of heart words and lesynges. And therefore rightful dome is
turned bacwarde / and rightfulnesse stood from far. He durst not put
forth his head / and treuth fell down openly in the street. He was borne
down openly / and no man would help him up. Equity says he ne euenhode in
shyftynge and in demynge might not enter / for treuthe is all forgeten. And he
that fled from wyckednesses was every man's pray Dives. Now I see that
periurye is a full grievous sin and full peryllous to every comunyte / and
cause of much manslaughter and shedyng of man's blood and lesynge of
Royalmes. For as I have read / y^ Royalme of England for periurye and
falshode was translated from Brytons to Saxons. Afterward it was translated
for periurye from Saxons and English men to the Danes. Afterward when
English men had the kingdom again by the death of the Danes / they kept it
but two kings times. Saint Edward and heraldes / and anon it was translated
again for periurye unto the Normans by Wyllyam duke of Normandy / which slough
well nyghe all the chyualrye of this land / and changed the lordshyp and the
prelacye of this land nyghe all unto the frensshe men. And what murdre and
shedynge of blood fell for these periurers in these three times and chau^gynges
full hard to tell. And now allas newely in our days we ben fallen in perjury
in the highest degree / not one but nygh all. And what blood has be shed
sythen because of our periurye / no tongue can tell. And this land by shedynge
of blood is so feblysshed in every astate that we be not of power without
special miracle of god longer for to withstand. And so it is full much to
dread y^ this royalme in short time for our periurye shall be translated again
to the Brytones / or else to some other tongues. I pray the say forth what
thou wylt.

Caplm.xix.
PAuper. Furthermore I said that gods name is taken in vain by mysherynge.
For if you have liking to here great oaths of other men / or omy mysswerynge.
Or if thou wait all vain oaths ne art not myspraysed when thou hereste them /
thou take gods name in vain / for thou do no worship thereto as thou
ought to do. For as Solomon says / a man's here should arise for fere /
and he should stop his eres when he herd gods name so despised. And if a man
swear to y^ sadly in gods name and auysely / thou art bounden to believe hy^
for worship of gods holy name / but thou have the more euydence to the
contrary. And but you accept his oath and give credence thereto but ye know
the contrary else you take gods name in vain / for thou do no due
worship thereto / but great despyte in that that thou wylt not believe so
worshypfull a witness as god is / whom he takes to witness so swerynge. For
many a simple man would be evil paid if thou forsokest him for witness of
treuthe. Dives. If I find a man often false in his oaths / though I believe him
not I do god no dishonor. Pauper. That is soth / for thou may well wot that
god sovereign treuth bears him no witness in his fasholde. And therefore do
worship to his oath and to gods name / and repreue his falshode and despyte
that he does to gods holy name. Moreover if thou here men swear or blaspheme
gods name / or name gods name in vanyte / if thou have liking therein /
thou take gods name in vain. And but thou rebuke or repreue them if you
have power over them / and grutche against their sinful speech / else thou
take gods holy name in vain by herynge. Also if thou have liking to here
errors against the faith of holy church to consent to them / or shrewde tales
/ or vain tales meddled with gods name and dishonest speech against the
worshypfull name of Christ and of crystendom / which speech no good christian
man ne woman ought to here / thou take gods name in vain by herynge. For
if thou love well thy god thou sholdest not here patiently any speech that
sowneth dishonor to his holy name For if thou louedest well any man or woman /
thou would here no speech sownynge ayenste their name and worship ne that
might be causes of their offense or velonye.

Caplm.xx.
ALso gods name is taken in vain by brekyng of couenau^te made in gods
name / and confermed by swerynge in gods name. As when peace and couenaut is
made between kings and Royal mes / between comunytees and between persons /
and between comunyte and person / and is confermed by swerynge. Than every man
and woman that knows it should flee to forfete in word or deed against the
covenant and the peace for the reverence of gods holy name by which it was
confermed. And all tho that wyttyngly breken such couenauntes / or procuren by
word or deed or assenten thertoto / that such covenant shall be broken / if
the covenant be lefull / all if it be not pleasant they take gods name in
vain. And all tho that know of the covenant and of the oath / if they by
retcheleshede of speech or of deed ben cause of brekynge of peace and of such
couenauntes whether it touch them or not / they take gods holy name in
vain and do great despyte thereto / sythen the peace and the covenant was made
in gods holy name / and confermed also. We read also in holy write Iosue.ix.
That when as Iosue and gods people began first for to conquer the land of
byheste / the people of Gabaon in gyle sent messagers to Iosue for to make
peace with Iosue and with gods people. The messagers in gyle did on old
clothes clowted / old shone patched and all to torn. They took hored bread in
their scryppes / and sour wine in their botels / and loded asses with old
hored bread in old sackes and came so to Iosue / and made a presaunt to him of
old vytayles and said to him. Your name spryngeth far and wide / that there
may no king nor nacyon withstand you. Therefore we be come to you for salvation
of our lives for to make peace with you. Than Iosue and the people said to
them. If ye dwell in the land that god has given to us / we may no peace
make with you. Than Iosue axed them what they were and from whens they came.
Sir said they we ben thy seuau^tes and come to the fro full far contrees
sent fro the lords and the leders of our land to make peace with the. Thou
may see by our arraye that we be come fro far. For when we came out our
clothes and our shone were new / now they ben al to torn and al to rent. Our
bread was new baken / and now it is hored. Our botels and our wine weren new
/ and now our botels be nygh brusten and the wine is sour / and our vytales
and the presaunt that we have brought to the ben nyghe lost for elde. And thus
they lied almoost every word and desceyued Iosue / for they dwelleden but.xx.
little mile thens. Iosue took their presaunt and made peace with them. And he
and all the princes of gods people swore to them that they should have their
lives and their goods. Within a few days after Iosue came to Gabaon / and
began to fight against the cite / anon they came out and showed her charter of
peace. And how that Iosue and the princes of gods people also had sworen to
them to save their lives / the people would have slain them because of their
gyle. Than Iosue and the princes sayden to the people / We may not slay them /
for we have sworen to them in the name of our lord. And if we forswere us /
god shall take vengeance of us. Dives. I trow that clerks now a days would
say that they were not bound to keep that oath / sythen they gate that oath
of them with so great begyle. Pauper. If they auysed them well they would say
as Iosue said. For as I first said / a man ought to keep his oath if it be
lefull though he made it for dread of death. For every oath leful ought to be
kept though it be never so much against heart / and that shows god well
afterward. For as we find the second book of the kings xxi. Three hundred
year after. Saull king of gods people slew all the Gabaonytes y^ he might
find to plese his people / which hated always y^ Gabaonites for their gyle
God was dyspleased with y^ deed / and let y^ king Saull soon after slain in
battle / and all his household and much of gods people. After in time of
Dauyd that reigned next after Saull. There fell such an hongre in the land of
Israel three year togydre y^ much of gods people perysshed. Dauyd axed of
god what the cause was of y^ hongre. God said yt the death of the Gabaonytes
which Saull had slain y^ was cause thereof. Dauyd sent after the Gabaonytes
that were left and said to them. I know well yt for you sake this hongre and
myschyef is fallen in my realm. Axe ye amends what ye will and I shall do it.
Than they said / we axe neither gold ne silver / ne no man's death of Israel
/ but oonly vengeance on Saull and his kynrede that so wyckedly oppressed us
and destroyed us. We axe that every man of his kynred be slain / and that none
be left of his kynrede. Dauyd might not grant that axynge for that oath that
he had made to Ionatas the sone of Saull to save his kynrede. Than they axed
seven men only of the kynrede of Saull to hang them on y^ gebettes against the
son / and so to slay them dyspyteously in punysshynge of the spyte y^ Saull
had do to gods holy name / in y^ he did against the solemn couenau^tes y^
his predecessors had made and confermed swerynge by gods holy name / for in
that Saull took that oath and gods holy name in vain. As says the maystre
of the stories. When this was done the hongre cessed / and anon began rain
and plente of corn and fruit. Dives. This ensample is full good and shows
well that every othelefull made should be kept. And that every man and woman
should flee to do dishonor or spyte to gods holy name. Also it shows well
y^ perjury and dyspysynge of gods holy name / is cause of shedynge of blood /
of hongre / and of myschyef / and that god will not suffer that his holy name be
despised ne taken in vain. Pauper. Therefore god says that every man and woman
that so takes his holy nama in vain. I shall do to the as you haste do thy
swerynge in dyspyte of me / and chargest not to break covenant therefore thou
shalt bear thy sin and have dyspyte therefore Eze.xvi. Also he says thus by
the prophet. If ye will not here ne set in your heart to give worshypp to my
name. I shall send to you hongre and need and myschyef. And I shall curse your
blessings / and take your might from you that ye shall not witstande.
Malachye.ij.^

Here ends the second commandment / and begins the third.
Caplm primu^.
Dives. I thank the much. For now know I better than I did before how the
second commandment should be kept / and what peril it is to take gods
name in vain. Now I pray the enfourme me in the third commandment. Pauper.
In the third commandment god byddeth that thou sholdest bethynke the and
have well in mind to halowe thyn holydaye. Six days thou shalt work and do
all thyn own works. In the.vij. day in the sabbot / that is to say / rest
of thy lord god. In that day thou shall do no seruyle work / neither thou
ne thy sone thy daughter ne thy servant / man ne woman / ne thy be / ne
the strangers that been within thy yates. Dives. Why badde god that the.vij.
day should more be hallowed than the.vi. day. Pauper. For as god says there.
In.vi. days he made heaven and earth and the sea and all thing that is therein.
And in the.vij. day he rested and cessed of his works / and therefore he
blessed that day and hallowed it / and ordained that in that day man and be
should rest / and that man that day in a specyaall should thank god / for
all the creatures that he made before in the.vi. days he made them to help
and service and solace of man. Dives Why says holy write that god rested than
the.vij. day in so much as that he never trauaylled. For as saint Austyn
says / he made all things without trauayll / and as holy write shows
Genesis pri.^ He said but this one short word. Fiat. and badde that it should
be done / anon it was done as he would have it Pauper. When holy writ says
that god rested the.vij. day / he understands thereby that in the.vij. day
he cessed for to make new creatures / for every thing was made by fore in
the.vi. days / either in y^ thing himself / as angel / light son moan and
sterres either in his kind and in his symplytude / as man be fysshe foul /
and grass and trees either in his causes / as thing gendred of corrupco^n /
and things made by craft. For god in his godhede was never in trauayll but
always in blysfull rest without end. And therefore holy writ says not that
he rested after his work ne in his work / but that he rested from every work
that he had made / for he had no trauayll for any work / and he was not helped
by his work / for he made no thing for need but al for love. Dives. Yet
contra te. Christ says in the gospel Io. Pater meus vsque mode operat et ego
operor. My fader werketh unto this time / and I work also. Therefore it seems
that god cessed not the vij. day from every work. Pauper. Two manner of works
longen to god / creacyon and governance. From the work of creacyon he cessed
the.vij. day / and than prycypally he began the work of governance and of
keeping / the which work he contynueth and shall continue without end. And
of this work of governance speaks Christ the words in the gospel / but not
of the words of creacyon. Dives. Ben there any mo causes why god badde the.vij.
day be hallowed. Pauper. There ben as clerks tallen.vi. causes. First for that
god the.vij. day rested / that is to say / he cessed fro creacyon of new
creatures. Also in tokenynge that god in the.vij. day delivered y^ childern of
Israel from the hard seruage of Egypt and led them through the read see
dry foot in to the rest of the land of byheste. As we read in holy write
Deuteronomy.v. Which delyuerau^ce was a token that mankind should thrughe Crystus
passion and by his blood that he shed upon the rode be delivered out of the
fendes seruage / and come to the endelesse rest of the land of life. The.iij.
cause is yt men should ye day pryncypally give them to holy medytacyon and to
thank god of all his gifts and his benefyces / and to learn gods law and
to praise god. The.iiij. cause was for to be a token that Christ the.vij. day
should rest in his grave after that he had trauayled.vi. days to refourme
again mankind that was lorne thrughe Adams sin. The.v. cause was to be a
token y^ we must al cesse from vices and the.vij. dedely sins if we will be
saved. As the prophet says. Quiescite agere perverse. discite been agere.
Ysaye.i. Rest ye to do amys and learn ye to do well. The.vi. cause is to be a
token of the endelesse rest that we shall have from sin and pain in the
bliss of heaven for the good works yt we do in the.vi. days of our life /
that is to say all the days of our life and the.vi. age of our life / and for
fulfill lynge the.vi. deeds of mercy which Christ names in the gospel. For as
we read in the apocalypse.xiiij. The holy ghoost to whom this commandment is
applied says that men after this life should rest fro their traueyles for their
good works follow them.

Caplm.ij.
Dives. Sythen that god badde that the.vij. day should be hallowed / why keep
we the viij. day than / that is the sunday / and not the.vij. day. Pauper.
God in the old law gaaf three manner of commandments. For some were
cerymonyall / some Iudycyall / and some moral. The cerymonyalles were but
fygures and shadows of things yt were to come. And therefore when tho things
were fulfilled that the cerymonyalles betokened / the cerymonyales cessed and
vanysshed away / as the shadow vanysshed away by light of the son.
Iudycyall commandments were in punysshynge of sin and Iustyfyeng / of
which some cessed / some dwell yet stylle. But moral commandments techeth
us to love our god and our even christian / and to flee sin and to love virtues
/ tho last always as the.x. commandments and such other And for asmoche as
this commandment is cerymonyal in part as anentes the time / and in part it
is moral / in asmoche as it techeth us to worship our god and to rest from
vices. Therefore in as much as it is moral it is kept / but in y^ y^ it is
cerymonynal it is changed in to sunday as for the better / for that y^ it
fygured and betokened is fulfilled. That was the rest of Christ in the
sepulcre in the.vij. day after the great trauayll that he had.vi. days before
in reformacyon and redempcyon of mankind. Also we be all bounden to worship
god now in the new law / but not in that manner ne in that time yt they were
bounden in the old law. Dives. Why is it more changed in the sunday than in
to an other day. Pauper. For the great benefyces and the great worshypfull
wondres that god showed that day to mankind. For on the sunday the world
began / and light and angellys kind was made. That day god sent down ma^na
that is angellys mete to the childern of Israel in deserte and fed them
also.xl. year. That day god gaaf Moses the law in the mount Synay. That day
Christ was borne of the maiden Mary to save mankind. That day Christ rose from
death to life gyuyng us example and hope to rise from death to life. That day the
holy ghost lyghted in Crystus apostles and his dyscyples. That day god shall
come to dome / as says a great clerk dockynge / super Deutro.^ And also that
day was the first day and shall be the last day that never shall have end.
But it shall be a day of endelesse bliss to them that shall be saved. For
right as Christ rose up from death to life on the sunday / and never deyed
afterward ne never shall deye. So shall we all in the last sunday y^ shall be y^
last day rise up from death to life and never deye after / but live in bliss
without end if we make here a good end. This day is so worshypfull y^ no
bishop may be sacred but on the sunday / as Raymu^de says li.i.ti. de
ferijs. And right as y^ satyrdaye was hallowed in the old law for the rest y^
god made in the satyrdaye after y^ creaco^n and the works that he made in the
first vi. days / so holy church through techynge of the holy ghoost has
ordained the sunday to be hallowed for the rest that mankind shall take after
the.vi. ages of this world on y^ sunday which rest and sabbot shall never
have end. Their sabbot that was on the satyrdaye tourneth always again to
trauayll / but our sabbot y^ is in the sunday at last shall turn in to
endelesse rest Joy and bliss. Sabbot in hebrewe is rest in english. And
every day in the weke is called sabbot and ferir y^ is rest in english. For
every day we be bound to ferie and to rest from sin. Also all the weke is
called sabbot / as there. Ie^unio bis in sabbato And Math.vlti.^ The sunday is
called the first day of the sabbottes / as there. Vna sabbatorum / and
Math.vlti.^ it is said. Prima sabbati. For it is first not oonly in order of
days / but it is also first in dygnyte. For y^ sabbot and the rest in the
solempnyte of the satyrdaye of the old law is now changed in to y^ sunday
for sin of y^ Jews which slew Christ on good frydaye / and so put our lady
saint Mary and all holy church in sorrow and care and great trauayll both
frydaye and satyrdaye while Christ lay in his grave. But for asmoche as he
rose from death to life on the sunday / and apperyd to his mod and to his
dyscyples.vij. times y^ day and so on the sunday began the first Joy
bliss and rest of the new law. Therefore by gods rightful dome the Jews
sabbot on the satyrdaye turned them to sorrow and care and much trauayll / and
our sunday turned us in to great rest and Joy and bliss. And as the
satyrdaye was hallowed by the old law / for god granted that day first
rest to all mankind after his dampnacyon to perpetuell trauayll for Adams
sin. So is now the sunday hallowed / for than Christ granted first rest
Joy and bliss to mankind in the new law after his passion and salvation of
mankind and the redempco^n / and turned the sorrow that holy church had on
the satyrdaye by malice of the Jews in to rest and bliss on y^ sunday. And
so it is fulfilled that the prophet Jeremy said.xxxi. Redemit dn^s populu^
suu^. God has bought again his people with his precious blood / and has
delivered his people out of the fendes power. God says I shall turn their
mourning in to Joy. I shall glad them of their sorrow and conforte them.
And by the prophet Ozee he said that he should make the Joy of ye Jews
sabbottes and of all their solempnytees and of all their festes to cesse
because of their sin Ozee.ij.

Caplm.iij.
ALso for halowynge in the satyrdaye was cerymonyal. For as we find in diverse
places of holy write / and namely Ezechielis xx. Halowynge in the satyrdaye was
a special token given to the Jews whereby they should be known from other
people / and so was circu^cisyon / and many other obseruau^ces and cerymonyes
that god gave them to be known from other people. And therefore right as the
circu^cisyon and other obseruau^ces that were bytaken them of god for a token
of distyncco^n from other people cessed in Crystus passion so cessed halowynge
in the satyrdaye in Crystus passion. For though it be a moral commandment to
halowe the.vij. day / yet it is not moral ne byndeth us to halowe the.vij.
day in the satyrdaye. And therefore we read Exodi.xxxiiij. et.xxxv. That when
Moses had been in the mount of Synay with god.xl. days and.xl. nyghtes without
mete or drink / and spoken with god and there taken the law we of him in two
tables of stone / and two stemys and bemes of light risen out of his face / as
it had be two horns so shynynge and so bright / that the people was adrede of
him and durst not speak with him / and therefore he put a veyll before his face
when he should speak to ye people / and tell them the laws and the will of
god. And when he had so hid his face with the veyll. The first law that he
gave them in gods name was to halowe the satyrdaye. And he spoke no word
than of the other.ix. commandments / but told forth other obseruau^ces and
cerymonyes which longed only to the Jews / and were but fygures and shadows
of things to come which cessed al in Crystus passion. And so he showed well
that halowyng in the satyrdaye was cerymonyale / and should cesse with other
cerymonyes in Crystus passion. And therefore when y^ he badde them halowe the
satyrdaye / he put the veyll before his face in token that halowynge on the
satyrdaye and other cerymonyes and laws y^ he gave them yt time was but a veyl
helynge ghoostly understanding under fygures of things y^ were to come. And
when tho things were fulfilled by the passion of Christ / y^ veyl and mysty
sight of fygures should be done away and cesse. And in token thereof in time of
Crystus passion / the veyl of the Jews Temple to rent and cleef in two parts
ye men might see all the preuy things y^ were in the Temple which were before
hid fro y^ sight of the people by y^ veyl. Also the same text of the
commandment shows full well that halowynge in the satyrdaye should be
translated in to the sunday / that is called the day of the son. For though
god cessed in the satyrdaye from making of things of new kind / yet in the
satyrdaye he made the satyrdaye as he made each day before in the same day.
But in the sunday next following he made no new day in kind / for that was
the first day / and so he rested more in the sunday from werkynge than he
did rest in the satyrdaye. Also after great trauayll ought to be more rest.
But Christ gods sone had more trauayl in recreacyon and redempcyon of
mankind / than he had to make all this world. For in making of all the
world he had no trauayll / as says saint Austyn / but oonly he badde it
should be done / and it was done anon what he would. But in creaco^n and
redempcyon of mankind he trauaylled so / that he swoted blood for anguysshe /
and deyed for trauayll and shed his heart blood / and cessed not of trauayll
tylle in the morrow tide of y^ sunday when he rose from death to live to
comfort all mankind that would believe in hy^. And he showed openly than that
he was and is lord of all thing. And said to his apostles / that all the
power in heaven and in earth was given to him in his manhood. And therefore the
sunday is called the lords day. Dies dn^icus. And therefore sythen god would
that the satyrdaye should be hallowed in the old law / for god cesse^ than
from creacyon / and so in that manner began to rest / much more he will that
the sunday be hallowed in the new law / for god cessed than from the great
trauayll of our redempcyon and of our saluaco^n and creacyon.

WE have also fygures of this in holy write Leuitici.xxiij.^ where we find yt
god badde the childern of Israel keep pryncypaly.vij. festes in the year / of
the which the last was called Festu^ tabernaculorum. The feste of
Tabernacles. He badde them take bows and branches of palm trees and of
other trees the fairest that they might find and make them tabernacles and
logges and dwell therein.vij. days togydre / in mind that god made them to
dwell in tabernacles and logges.xl. year in deserte and there he saved them
and kept them and he badde that the first day and the viij. should be full
holy. By this feste of tabernacles yt came last after the other festes of the
Jews ben understood the festes of the new law / which came last in the
end of the world after the old law. For all the festes of the new law ben
festes of tabernacles. For when god came for to be man / he made first his
tabernacle in the maid Mary / which tabernacle was arrayed and dyght with the
fairest branches and bows of grace and virtues and of good thewys / as it
might be founden in any creature / for she passed al creatures in grace and
goodness. Of this tabernacle speaks the prophet.p^o.xviij. In sole posuit
tabernaculu^ suu^ et ipse tanquam sponsus procedens de thalamo suo. He made his
tabernacle in the son that was our lady maiden and mother bryghter than the
son. He came out of her as an husbonde out of his chamber. An other
tabernacle god made him in our manhood and in our kind / that was the blysfull
body that which he took of the maiden Mary. For as the tabernacles were made
of the fairest branches and bows that might be found / so the body of
Christ was made and gadred togydre of the clenest drops of the blood that was
in our blyssed lady saint Marye clean maiden without spotte of sin. In this
tabernacle god was born of y^ maiden on Crystmasse day. In this tabernacle he
was circumcyded / worshypped of the three kings / and dwelled with us in earth
in our pilgrimage.xxxij. year and more. In this tabernacle he deyed for
mankind / and rose from death to life on Ester day / and styed up in to heaven
on holy thursdaye very god and very man / and there he sytteth on his faders
right hand above all heuens in this tabernacle lord and king of all thing.
In this tabernacle he shall come again at the dome / to deem the quycke and the
deed. And all the festes that we hold of any saints / we halowe them and
hold them for the good deeds that they did while they dwelled here in the
tabernacle of their body / in hope to come to the endelesse tabernacle full of
Joy and bliss without end. Of which tabernacle god speaks in the gospel
when he byddeth the rich men make poor men their friends / that they may
resceyue them in to the endelesse tabernacle / of which speaks Dauyd. Qua^
dilecta tabernacula tua dn^e virtutu^. concupiscit et deficit aia mea in atria
dn^i. Lord of virtues how lovely and how liking ben thy tabernacles. My soul
says he desires and longs to enter in to the halles of our lord. And for
his desire is delayed / he fails and faynteth for sorrow. And so y^
solempnyte that ever shall last / shall be a solempnyte of tabernacles / when
we shall dwell in endelesse tabernacles with endless rest Joy and bliss.
There the first day and the.viij. day shall be full holy / which day is
the sunday. For yt is the first day and it is the.viij. day and shall be
the last day ever lasting in Joy and bliss. And therefore in the festes of
y^ new law that been festes of the tabernacles is y^ sunday pryncypally
hallowed as god badde than. For it was the first day and it is the.viij. day
/ and it shall be the last day ever lasting in Joy and bliss.

Dives. Why badde god that we should think to halowe well the holy days and
the sabbot. Pauper. There is three manner of sabbottes / that is to say of rest
or of halowynge. Scilicet pectoris. temporis. et eternitas. That is to say of
rest of heart / of time / and of endless resting. By rest of heart and of
thought men come to rest of time. And by rest of thought and of time / men
come to endelesse rest. So without rest of heart and of thought / no man may
come to the endelesse rest that the sabbot and the holy day betokens And
therefore god bad us that we should pryncypally trauayll to have sabbot and
rest of heart and of thought / without which rest and sabbot we may not well
halowe any holy day. And therefore Christ said in the gospel / that out of the
heart when it is out of rest come evil thoughtis / manslaughters auoutrers /
lecherers / theftes / false witnesses / and dyspyte of god Mathei.xv. which
sins destroy charity and peace / and ben causes of much unrest in this
world / and let rest of time so that uneaths they may be any time in
rest. And therefore god says / think that you halowe well thyn holy day.
Bethynke the if thou be in charity and rest of heart with god and man And if
you be styred against thyn even christian by wrath hate or envy / or have any heavy
heart against thy brother / go as god byddeth in the gospel and be first
recou^seylled to thy brother / and than come and make thyn offrynge of holy
prayer of thanking of praysynge / and of thy gifts to god. And but thou do
so and put away all rancour and heaviness of heart / else thyn halowynge and
thy sabbot is not pleasant to god. Also bethynke the if you be in dedely sin
/ and repent the and be shreuen as soon as you might in good manner / and so
offer up thy self to god by charity and by sorrow of heart and make thy self
holy / and than art thou able to halowe well the holy day. For as long as you
art in dedely sin by will or by deed / so long thou halowest not thyn holy
day. For thou do seruyle work of sin / and do dyspyte to the holy day
/ which is or deyned that men should than amend them and serve god more
specially than in the werken day. And as long as man or woman is in dedely
sin / they serve the devil and not to pleasau^ce of god. Also god byddeth
that men should bethynke them to halowe well the holy day. For in the holy
day namely on y^ sunday men should draw their wits to gydre from the
world and bethynke them if they had ought trespassed that woke by recheleshede
or by couetyse / or by lechery / or by any other wise / and ask god
forgyuenesse. Also think on the good speed and benefyces that god has sent
them that woke / or ever before and thank him thereof. Thank him of his
endelesse mercy / and of his endelesse charity that he showed to mankind.
Think how he made man to his own likeness to be heir and cytezeyn of heaven.
Think how he made all thing for man. Think what bliss he has ordained to
man and woman if they do well / and what pain if they do evil.

Caplm.vi.
Therefore says Orygenes supro Leuiticu^.xxviij. On the sunday thou sholdest
do no worldly things / but oonly give the to god and also to ghoostly
things. Than says he come to church / and lay thyn eres to gods word /
think heavenly things / think on the life that we hopen all for to have in
endelesse bliss. Think on the last dome how hard that shall be and how
strayte. Take than none head to this world ne to things bysyble. But on the
holy day have thy ghoostly eye pryncypally to things that been to come and
that yet ben Inuysyble. He that thus does says he haloweth well his holy day /
and he makes the sacrefyce of his sabbot. And therefore the law says thus /
we have ordained that all sondayes be kept with all manner worship from even to
even / and that men absteyne them from all manner unlawful works / that there
be no markette holden on the sunday / ne plee / ne no man dampened to death /
ne to pain / ne none oath taken solempnely / but if it be for peace or for some
other great need. Extra li.ij.ti. de ferijs. Omnes dies dn^icos. The law says
that men should no thing do on the sunday / but give them to god / ne do no
seruyle work. But that day should be occupied in pray sing and worshyppynge
of god and in ghostly songs. De con di.iij. Ieiunia Men should on y^ holy day
serve god with heart mouth and work. With heart think as I have said. With
mouth well speaking in prayer praysynge and worshypynge of god / and good
informacyon of their even christian. In work also of deeds of alms / in peace
making and according of neighbors and such other. But now alas it is
fulfilled yt Ieremye said Trenorum pri.^ Viderunt eam hosts et deriseru^t
sabbata eius. The enemies that been the fendes see how man's soul and womannes
was defouled with sin on the holy days / and scorned his holy days and his
sabbottes. For the holy day was ordained in confusyon of y^ fend and in
worship of god and for saluaco^n of man's soul. But now it is turned to shame
of man's soul / and to despyte and offense of god / and in pleasaunce of the
fend. For in the sunday reygneth more lechery / glotony / manslaughter /
robbery / bacbytynge / perjury / and other sins / more than reigned all the
weke before. And when men come to church / they leave bidding of bedes and
spend their time in sinful Iangelynge / for there they cast gyle against
their even christian / there they hold their peruys of many wrongs which they
think to do. And therefore god may say to them as he said to y^ Jews. It is
written said he that mine house shall be called an house of prayer and ye have made
it a den of thieves in yt yt ye contryue your gyle and falshode to rob your
even christian of his good / his right / and his fame. And therefore he says by
the prophet Ysaye.i. My soul hates your solempnytees and holy days / they
ben full heavy to me I have trauayll to suffer them. But therefore says he / when
ye shall lift up your hondes to me. I shall turn mine eyes away from you. And
also when ye multeplye your prayers to me. I shall not here you / for your
hondes be full of blood that ye have shed and full of sin. And your company
and your gadrynges togydre ben full wicked. Iniqui sunt cetus vestri.

Caplm.vij.
ALso my friend god badde yt men should think to halowe well the holy day.
For man and woman should so bethynke them before in the work day and ordeyn
their occupaco^ns also / y^ they should not need to break y^ holy days. For if
a ma^nedeth to break the holy day / and y^ need come of his own folly and of
his mysgouernau^ce before / he is not excused. by that need. Much less than
is he excused if that need come of purpose and of couetyse. And therefore they
that will not go ne send to market in the work day to bye their necessaryes
/ but abide till on the sunday for sparynge of time / they be not excused
though tho things ben nedeful to them. Men should study and dyspose them as
besely to serve god on the sunday / as they study before to trauayl for
themself on the work day For god has granted.vi. days to man and woman
for to trauayll for themself / and the.vij. day he has reserved and kept to
his service. We read in holy write Numeri.xv. That a man went in the sabbot
day and gadred styckes. He was taken and led to Moses / and he put him in
prison till he had an answer of god what he should do with him. God badde
Moses that he should be led out of gods castles yt were called the
dwellynges and tentys of gods folk / and there the people should stone him
to death. And so he was slain pytefully for he bythought him not before for to
halowe the holydaye / for he might have gadred styckes in the day before. And
sythen he was so spytefully slain for gadrynge of styckes to make therewith
his fire yt was nedeful to him. Much more should they be punysshed y^ on the
sunday gadre togydre brondes of sins / of couetyse / of lechery / perjury /
and bacbytytnge for to brenne with their souls in hell with out end but they
amend them Dives. What calls god seruyle works Pauper. Every dedely sin
is seruyle work. For as Christ says in the gospel. Who so does sin he is
seruau^te of sin and thrall to the fend. Qui facit peccatu^ seruus est
peccati. And such seruyle work god forbedeth every day / but most on the
holy day. For who so does dedely sin on the holy day he does double sin /
for he does y^ sin and thereto he breketh the holy day against gods
commandment. Also seruyle work is called every bodily work done pryncypally
for temporal lucre and worldely winning / as byenge and selling / erynge /
sowynge / mowynge / repynge / and all crafts of worldely winning. Also
pledynge / motynge / markettes / fayres / sitting of Justices and of Iuges /
shedynge of blood and execucyon of punysshynge by the law / and all the works
that should let a man from gods service / and dyspose him to couetyse or to
the fendes service. Nevertheless if erynge and sowynge / repynge / mowynge /
cartynge and such other nedeful works be done purely for alms / and oonly
for heavenly mede / and for need of them that they ben to / in light holy days
than they ben no seruyle works / ne the holy day thereby is not broken.
Nevertheless in the sondayes and great festes such works should not be done
but for great need compelle men thereto.

Caplm.viij.
Dives. why badde god yt both man and be should rest and halowe the holy
day. Pauper. For as Solomon says Sap^.vi. et.xi. God loves all thing that
he made / and has cure of al things that he made. And therefore he ordained
rest in the holy days / not only for his own worshypp and for ghoostly help
of soul / but also for bodily help both of man and be. But the couetyse
of man were refreyned by rest on the holy day he should never rest. But with
trauayll slay him self / his servants / his subgettes / add his bestes. And
therefore both to save man and be and for great prouffyt of man / god badde
rest on the holy day. For both man and be needs rest after traueyl and
shall be the more fressher all the weke after to trauayll if they have rest on
the holy day. And therefore it falls often that they which will not rest on
the sunday / ben made to rest al y^ weke after / either of sickness that
they fall in by over trauayll / or by sekenes / or by feebleness of their
servants / and of their bestes / or else by death. For oftentyme they slay
their bestes by over much trauayll / and contynuynge of trauayll. And therefore
in the beginning of the world as when Adam sinned in the.vi. day by etynge
of an apple against gods commandment / and that god had dampened him and
all his to perpetuell trauayl for his sin. After this of his great and
endelesse mercy / he tempred and slaked his hard dome / and ordained rest
both to man and be in the.vij. day. And therefore says holy write Gen^.ij.
That god fulfilled his works in the.vij. day not oonly / for he made than
the.vij. day and cessed of creaco^n / but also pryncypally for he showed than
first mercy against sin granting and bidding rest in the.vij. day both
to man and to be which he dampened in the day before to perpetuell trauayll
for Adams sin / which mercy was fulfyllynge and parfecco^n of al his works
Quia miseraco^es eius super omnia opera eius. For as Dauyd says gods mercy
is above all his works. And saint James says. Mercy enhau^seth rightful
dome. And but god had ended his works in mercy in the vij. day / and slaked
his hard dome against mankind for Adams sin / else his works had not ben
complete ne parfyght / in asmoche as y^ pryncypal creature for whom he made all
thing was lost. For when the fynale cause of any work fails / that work
is not complete ne parfyght. For this mercy yt god showed to man when he
ordained rest in the.vij. day that was called sabbot / figure of endelesse
rest of mankind. Christ says in the gospel. That the sabbot was made for man
/ not man for the sabbot Marci.ij. But sinful man be so blent with couetyse /
yt he tourneth his dampnaco^n and his pain in to liking / and has lever to
trauayll to his undoing and unto his dampnacyon / than to rest to his
saluaco^n. And has lever to follow the hard sentence of god to his
punysshynge / than to take his grace and his mercy to be eased / Such ben like
oules and backs / which hate the day and love the night / like to the fendes
of hell yt never have recte / ne for malice will seek rest.

Caplm.ix.
QOre over my friend we find four manner of sabbottes in holy writ. One
sabbot of days that was the.vij. day ordained of god for rest and ease both
of man and of be. Also we find a sabbot of months ordained also of god
for to rest both of man and be that was the.vij. month that man and be
should rest them than after the great trauaylle that they had done in the
two months before / in which was their heruest to gadre corn / wine / and
oil / and other fruit. The vij. month was Septembre / as for than in that
hot contree heruest was all done. Also we find a sabbot of years / that was
the.vij. year. For that year the land rested y^ it might bear the better and
the more plenteuously after / for that year was no land sown. Also we find
a sabbot of sabbottes / that was the fyfth year ordained of god for rest of
the land / of be / of man / and namely of them that were in trauayll of
trybulacyon. For than outlawed men might come again home in surete. Than bound
men were made free / and dettes forgyuen. Than men resceyued again their
heritage. By the sabbot of days is vnderstonden rest from vices in the life
actyf / that has.vi. days to work in. By the sabbot of moan is vnderstonden
rest that men have in the life contemplatyf / both from vices and temptaco^ns
/ for that month was much holy / but not all holy. Right so they that have
the life contemplatyf they have more rest from vices and temptaco^ns / than
they that have the life actyfe / but full rest have they not in this world. By
the sabbot of years when the land rested the.vij. year / is vnderstonden the
rest that our souls shall have in the bliss of heaven whiles the earth of our
bodies shall rest in the grave. By the sabbot of sabbottes that was the.l.
year is vnderstonden the rest without end / that we shall have in heaven when
we shall go again both body and soul unto our heritage yt we lost thrughe
Adams sin / when all our trauayll and trybulaco n shall cesse and all our woo
turn to well by virtue of Crystus passion.

Caplm.x.
Dives. Sythen the sabbot of days was most solemn in the old law / for it
was not lefull that day to go over a thousand pass / ne to dyght their mete /
and more over yt day were offered two lambs passing the common sacrefyce that
was done every day / sythen than the solempnyte of the sabbottes is translated
in the new law in to the sunday / why is not the sunday as worshypfull in
the new law / as was the sabbot in the old law. For as that was called the
sabbot of our lord / also the sunday is called the day of our lord passing
all other days And yet we have in the year many days more solemn than is
the sunday. Pauper. All the festes of the new law that been the days and the
sabbottes of our lord. For all tho ben of him self in him self / or else
of him self in his saints. In the old law was no feste of our lord but
only the sabbot / which was hallowed in mind of the creaco^n of the world /
and in mind yt god the.vij. day cessed of creacyon. And also than to thank
him for his endelesse goodness that he showed to mankind in his creacyon when
he made all bodily and vysyble creatures to serve man / and man to serve him
here in grace and after in the bliss of heaven without end Other festes of the
old law were but sole^pnytees and minds of auentures and prosperytes y^
fell to the Jews in time of the old law. And therefore the sabbot among
them was most solemn. And among us also the sunday is most solemn and
holy for the great deeds and wondres that god did in the sunday. But for as
much as it comes often we make it not always like solemn / for it falls
the sunday in which god showed his wondres / as Esterdaye Wytsondaye to be
more solemn than other common sondayes. Other festes also as Crystmasse day
and Epyphanye day / in as much as they ben our lords days and come but ones
in the year / therefore we make more solempnyte in tho days / than we do
commonly on the sunday. And so we do in many other festes / for all they be
festes and days of our lord. Nevertheless there is no day so solemn in
themself as the sunday / for that is always solemn for y^ wondres that god
did therein. Other days sometime ben solemn / and sometime not solemn after
that the festes therein fall by chau^gynge of the year / so that other days
have no solempnyte of themself by custom ne by law / but only by falling
of festes as the year changes. The thursdaye was some time as holy as the
sunday / for Christ styed up that day to the heaven. And than began the
processyon that we use on the sunday / for than Christ went in processyon
with his dyscyples out of Jerusalem in to the mount of Olyuete / and there he
styed up in the sight of them all. And the cross y^ is borne before us in y^
processyon / betokens that Christ deyed on the cross / and afterward he
arose again from death to life. And on the holy thursdaye went he before his
dyscyples ledyng them unto the mou^te of Olyuete. But for as much as many new
festes comen on / and it was grievous for to keep two days so lempne every woke
/ therefore the solempnyte of the thursdayes cessed / and the processyon in
mind of Crystes ascen s;yon was translated in to the sunday Dives. Therefore me
thinks that the sunday should be the more solemn. Pauper. So it is / and
so it ought for to be most hallowed though holy church do not always than
most solempnyte / for that day is ordained for rest in the new law both to
man and be / as the sabbot was ordained for rest in ye old law.

Caplm.xi.
Dives. Be we bounden by this commandment to keep the holy days that holy
church has ordained in the new law. Pauper. Yes forsooth / for though the
commandment passed in that / ye it was cerymonyall as anentes time / yet it
dwells in that it was and is moral / and byndeth us to flee vices and serve
our god one day more than another / which day is y^ sunday in the new law
by ordenau^ce of god and holy church. For as y^ gospel says Ma. xij. Dn^s
est em^ filius hoi^s et sabbati. The maidens sone Christ Ihesus is lord of the
sabbot. And for as much as it was so evil kept in the old law / and so
much blood was shed in the sabbot / and Christ himself suffered so much
despyte on the sabbot / therefore he was dyspleased and said by the prophets
Ysaye.i. and Ozee.ij. That he should no longer suffer their sabbottes / but as
a lord of the sabbottes he changed that rest and solempnyte of their
sabbottes in to the sunday / for the causes which I said before / which day
all if it be the.viij. day in the first order of days / yet it is but
the.vij. day in obseruau^ce of the commandment For we have now.vi. days for
to work in / in token y^ god in.vi. days made all y^ world / and the vij.
day we halowe as god badde us in token yt god the.vij. day cessed of creaco^n
and ordained rest in y^ sunday As saint Poule says in his pystle / ad
Colo.ij. That openly the sabbot and other festes of the old law were but
shadows and fygures of the new law And therefore after Crystus passion tho
festes cessed and no man ought to keep them. And who so keeps them in yt he
forsakes y^ Christ was borne of the maiden and deyed for mankind And saint
Gregorye in his pystle ad To says. That all that halowe the satyrdaye / for it
was so holy in the old law that been Antecrystes dyscyples. For Antecryste
shall do men halowe both sunday and satyrdaye. Sunday for to draw christian
people to his sect / for he shall feign him deed and to arise again fro death to
life on y^ sunday And y^ satyrdaye to draw the Jews to his sect. De
con.di.iij. Peruenit.

Caplm.xij.
Dives. Why would god make the world more in the nombre of.vi. days than in
any other nombre of days. Pauper. For as Solomon says. God made al thing in
nombre in weight and in mesure. He made no thing to much ne to little. But
he made every thing parfyghtly in his kind / and ended all his works in
parfyghtnesse. And for the nombre of.vi. is the first nombre even y^ is
parfyght / therefore he made all the world in nombre of.vi. days. Dives. How
is y^ nombre of.vi. days more parfyght than another nombre. Pauper. For all
his parts y^ mete him if they be taken to gydre make even.vi. as.i.ij.iij.
make even.vi. and these.iij. mete him. For.vi. times one is.vi. and thryes two
is.vi. and twyes three is.vi. And this parfecco^n is in no nombre within.x. but
in.vi. And fro.x. to an hundred is none but xxviij. And fro an hundred to a
thousand is but this even nombre four hundred four score and.xvi. The next
is.viij. thousand one hundred and xviij. and tha^ no mo such but one with in
an hundred thousand. And who so will find that he must study. After an
hundred thousand ben mo such than all the clerks under the son can tell /
and mo than any heart may think or tongue can tell / and yet is it full hard
to find one. And for that.vi. is the first parfyght nombre in this manner.
Therefore god would make this world in the nombre of.vi. in a token that all
his works were parfyght. And therefore says holy write Gen^.ij. That heaven and
earth and al their arraye were parfyght And for the same cause god made man
the.vi. day as for a parfyght and a noble creature. For the same cause in
the.vi. age of the world he bycame man. And on the.^i. day a good frydaye
the.vi. hour of ye day in the.vi. age he bought mankind again with his
precious blood in token y^ all his works were parfyght. And the same nombre of
days god has granted us for to work in / in token y^ all our works should
be parfyght and good / and no thing do amys / that we should for no couetyse
do to much / ne for no sloth do to little / but hold us always in a mean
and in euenhe de / for god granted us no time to sin Therefore will he that
we always be even with god and with our even christian / as six is always even
with his parts to gydre.

Caplm.xiij.
Dives. Why bad god rest on the.vij. day more than an other day. Pauper In
token that as.vij. comes next after y^ parfyght nombre of.vi. days of
werkynge / so after parfyght works in this world shall follow parfyght rest
in the other world. Also he badde rest in the.vij. day for y^ passes the
parfyght nombre / in token y^ he will that no thing be done passing
parfecco^n. And therefore all sin is comprehended in.vij. dedely sins. For
as.vij. passes y^ parfyght nombre of.vi. so every sin passes parfecco^n and
is out of parfecco^n of all good works. Also god badde rest the.vij. day for
he will that men rest them than both goostly and bodily. Goostly from
business and thought of the world. Bodily from bodily trauayll. For why vij.
is made of four and three. Four betokens bodily things made of four
elements. Three betokens man's soul made to the likeness of the holy
trynyte. And therefore he badde rest in the.vij. day yt men should than rest
both body and soul. Also god bad rest in the.vij. day in token y^ after
parfyght works shall follow endeles rest both of body and of soul. For this
no^bre. vij. in asmoche as all time and all duraco^n is comprehended in.vij.
days therefore it betokens endeles lasting. And therefore rest on the.vij.
day betokens endeles rest. Also my friend god ordained rest in the.vij.
day in token of.vij. blysses which we shall have for parfyght works yt we do
here in.vi. days and.vi. ages of this world. For anentes y^ body we shall
have four blysses / bryghtnesse and beauty without any spotte. For as Christ
says in the gospel. Men and wymen shall shine in heaven as bright as the

manner sickness / no thing shall dear them ne disease them. Also they shall
have delyuerhede of body and lightne s;se without lettynge / for they should be
as light as thought and in twynkelynge of an eye be where as they will Also
they shall have sotylte of body without any withstanding / for there shall no

with woo / in token of these seven blysses that we shall have in endelesse rest
for our parfyght works. Therefore god badde us rest in the.vij. day.

Dives. Why long ought the holy day to be kept and hallowed Pauper. From even
to even / as Raymonde says and the law also. Extra li.ij.ti.de ferijs. Omnes
dies dominicos. And holy write says also and god him self Leuitici.xxiij. A
vespera vsque ad vesperam celebrabitis sabbata vestra. From even to even ye
shall halowe your holy days. Nevertheless some begin sooner to halowe after
that the feste is / and after use of the contree. Extra e. quonia^. But that
men use in the satyrdayes and vygylyes to ring holy even at myddaye compels
not men anon to halowe / but warns them of the holy day following y^ they
should think thereon and speed them / and so dyspose them and their occupaco ns
that they might halowe in due time. Dives. Is it leful for any causes in the
sunday to gadre in corn fruit or hay. Pauper. Such need it may be that it is
excusable / as if they may not in other days gadre it in for enemies / as in
time of war / if they should gadre it they have rightful cause to withstand
their aduer s;aryes. Also if corn or grass be in the field and should be lorne
but it were dyght and gadred / it is lefull in the holy days to save it and
keep it / so that gods service be not left therefore / But for to mow or to
repe / carre or to sow in the sunday. I hold it not lefull but in full great
need. Pryncypale festes should always be hallowed / but right great need
compelled men for to work / so that great need excused them. For as the law
says. Extra li.v. De regulis iuris. Need makes lefull that else is unlawful
by the law / for need has no law. De con.di.i. Sicut. et di.v. Discipulos.
Extra de furtis. Si quis per necessitatem Also is lefull to fysshe after the
service on the sunday and other fysshe also that may not be taken but certain
ceson of the year / for which fysshe men must goo far in the sea and long
abide. Extra de ferijs.ca. Licet. It is lefull also to do rightful batayles on
the sunday / and also in other holidays for salvation of the comunyte Than it
is lefull to save that er they should all perysshe both man and be fruit
corn and other things always with reverence of god and of the holy day. It
is lefull than to leches to help the seek folk. It is leful to dyke or wall
in defense of towns castles and to array men to battle in the sunday when
need compels and peril of enemies. Thus says Io. in
su^.con.li.i.ti.xij.q^.vij. So that in all these and such other / need and
pity excuses men. Christ helyd men in the sabbot / and repreued the Jews that
were dyspleased therewith / and said to them. Sythen a man takes his
circu^cisyon in the sabbot / why have ye Indygnacyon to me for yt I have made a
man hole in the sabbot. Io. vij. And in an other place he said to the Jews who
is it of you that has a sheep and it falled in the dyche in the sabbot / that
will not go and lift it up out of the dyche. But forsooth man is better than a
sheep / and therefore says he / it is lefull to do good deeds in the sabbot and
in the holy day. Mathe^.xij. An other time Christ helyd a woman of an hard
seknesse that had holden her xviij.year / she went stoupynge don ward and
might not look upward. Than the maystre of the law and of the Synagoge was
wroth and said to the people. There ben.vi.days to work in / come than and be
ye helyd and not in the sabbot. Christ answered to him. Thou ypocryte / each of
you unbinds his ox and his ass from the maunger or cratche in the sabbot
and ledeth it to the water. Much more it is nedeful for to unbind this
daughter of Abraham in the sabbot from the hard bound in the which Sathanas
had holden her bounden xviij. year long. And all tho ypo^rytes were ashamed By
these examples Christ showed that deeds of pity and of alms / and namely
prechynge and techynge / by which man's soul is losed out of the fendes
bounds / they ben medefull and needful in the holy days. And he excused
Dauyd by need / that he ete of the holy loves that no lewd man should have
eten of by the law. Also he excused his discyples yt they gadred the eerys in
the field in the sabbot and ete the corn Man.xij. For as he says there / god
loves better mercy and pity / than any sacrefyce.

Caplm.xv.
Nevertheless notwithstondynge all this every man and woman should besely
halowe y^ holy day / and not lightly for no small need break thyn holy days.
For god charged this commandment full hyghely when he said. Think that thou
halowe well the holy day. And in an other place Deu.v. He says Look that you
halowe well the holy day And in an other place of holy writ he says. Look ye
keep well my sabbot and my day / for that is a token between me and you. Who so
defouleth that day or does any seruyle work in that day / he shall deye
Exodi.xxi. Leuitici.xvi.et.xix. Item Iere^.xvij. Ezechielis.xx. et.xxij.
et.xxiij. By the law / bochers / tauerners / and other vytaylers may lefully
dyght in the sunday vytayles to be sold in the mondaye / if they might not
dyght it in the day before to save them and their vytayles / so that it be
done pryncypaly to gods worship / and for the common prouffyte. Also
merchants that leden their marchau^dyse in y^ sunday and other holy days to
fayres in far contree by land of by water ben excu s;ed if they may not led
them in other days. Also messagers / pilgrims / and wayfarynge men that may
not well rest without great harm / ben excused / so y^ they do their
dylygence to here mass and matyns if they can For long abydyng in a man's
Journey is costly and peryllous. Also they that let to hyre horse and carte /
or ship to pylgryms / and to passing folk in the sunday for to speed them in
their Journey / if they do it pryncypaly for ease and speed of them that so
hyre them / they ben excused. But if they do it pryncypally for lucre or for
couety s;e / they be not excused. Also if men for hastynesse do them shave or
do their horse shoe in the sunday when they may not well abide / ne might not
well do it before / they ben excused if need compelle them thereto / and not
couetyse ne slouthe. Mylleners or craft by wind and water is lefull in the
sunday after custom of the contree / for so it may be do with little trauayl
/ but for to do it with draught of bestes in the sunday it is not leful for it
may so not be done without great trauayl. Thus says Io.in su^.con.
li.i.ti.xij. De ferijs et tabule iuris.

Dives. It is not lefull men to begin great Iourneys in the sunday / of
long pilgrimage or of far passing. Pauper. If they do it of custom or
without need / than they sin grievously / all though they here their service
er they goo / and namely men of holy church that should in holy days occupye
them most in gods service and deuoco^n and in techynge of gods law / and
give the people good example to halowe well the holy day. Prechours that
trauayll from town to town in the sunday and in great festes to teache the
people gods law ben excused and win much mede. But be they ware that
under color of prechyng they run not to much about in vain in the sunday.
Dives. Is it lefull in great holy days to travail about making of holy
church / as in caryage / lyftynge of stones / gaderynge of stones and such
other. Pauper. As for a little it is lefull / but not long to do travail ne
over great y^ men should bring to werynesse for to let them fro gods
service. For the holy day represents endelesse rest and halowynge without
end. And therefore I hold it unlawful to make great caryages in the sunday /
or any pryncypall feste for any church making. Dives. Is it not lefull to
help men of holy church in the great holy days to housynge in caryage and
other trauayll. Pauper. If they be poor it is lefull as for a little to help
them in housyng / but if they be rich enough to pay therefore in the work
day it is not leful to trauayll for them in the sunday and other great
festes. Dives. Is it lefull to vytaylers or other chapmen to ride or to go fro
town to town in the sunday to selle vytayles or other things in the church
or in the church yerde or at the church yate. Pauper. Nay forsooth For there
should no such markette be holden in the sunday / ne in sentuary ne out.
Extra de ferijs. Omnes dies dominicos. And therefore ben market days ordained
in other days yt men should than bye and selle / and halowe in the sunday.
But it is lefull to vytayler to selle vytayles in their own places / so that
they do it pryncypally for alms of their even christian / and for to here
their service. Auyse hem that than bye. Dives. Is it lefull for to work in the
sondayes when that euensonge is said and when that the folk have herd gods
service. Pauper. Nay forsooth / but great ne de compelled them for to work as I
first have said / for else men should be bounden to halowe from even to even.
And therefore when euensonge is done at after none in the sunday / yet is it
not lefull to work than. And also when that euensonge is said in the satyrdaye
at after none / yet is it lefull for to work tylle the son goo down.
Nevertheless so lytyl the work may be that it is no sin to do it than.
Dives. How should men know how much work is lefull for to do in the holy
day / and what need that excuses man of trauaylynge in the sunday / and in
other great festes for couetyse and wanbyleue that men trust not to god / but
wene that god should fail them / and put folk in dread of need / when there
should else be no dread of such need. Pauper Therefore if they might redely
have their bysshopp / they should axe him counsel / or else their curate /
or some other good wise man. And if the need be great and open / there own
conscience ought to excuse them / for they may than work by auctoryte of the
law And if a man or woman axe counsel in things of doubt of hy^ y^ he
weneth should give hy^ resonably good counsel / though the cou^seyllour fail
in his counsel gyuynge / yet y^ axer is excused / but he know yt y^
counsel is not good / or else did no dylygence to know it / and for he
loweth him to axe counsel and forsakes his own wit and his own will he
gets great mede

Caplm.xvij.
Dives. When servants trauayll in the sunday by compellynge of their
soueraynes ben they not excused before god by their maystres bidding. Pauper
If they trauayll and do their maystres bidding pryncypally for dread and for
obedyence that they owe to their soueraynes / and not for couetyse ne for none
other evil cause / and the manner of trauayll be lefull in it self / than they
ben excused. For as holy writ says. God loves better obedyence than
sacrefyce. But beware the sovereign that compels his seruau^te in the
sunday or any great feste without great need. For to the soueraynes is
halowyng of holy day pryncypaly boden / for without their will their servant
ne their beestes commonly shall do no seruyle works. Dives. In ryaltees as
plays and dau^ces that are used in great festes and in the sondayes / are they
not lefull. Pauper. In ryaltees as in plays and daunces yt ben done
pryncypally for deuoco^n honest and myrthe to teache men to love god the more /
and for no rybaudry / ne meddled with rybaudry ne lesynges ben lefull / so that
the people be not let thereby from gods service / ne fro herynge of gods
word and yt none errors be meddled in such ryaltees and plays against the
faith of holy church ne against good lyunge. All other plays ben forboden
both holy days and werken days. De con. di.iij. Irreligiosa. Et extra
li.iij.ti.i. cu^ decore^. Where ye gloss says. That for to represente in
playnge at Crystmasse Herodes and the three kings and other processes of the
gospelles both than and at Ester and other times also it is lefull and
commendable. Dives. Than it seems by thy speech that in holy days men may
lefully maken myrthe. Pauper. God forbede else For as I said / the holy day
is ordained for rest and releuynge both of body and of soul. And therefore
in law of kind / in law written / in law of grace / and ever from the
beginning of the world the holy day has been so lacyous with honest both for
soul and body / and for worship of god whose day is that day / solacyouse in
clothing in mete and drink / in occupaco^n / honest with myrthe making. And
therefore the prophet says. He dies qua^ fecit dn^s. exultemus et letemur in
ea. This is the day yt god made / make we now merry and be ye glad Dives.
Co^tra. Saint Austyn says that it were less sin to goo at the plough and at
the carte / and card and spynne in the sunday / than to lead daunces. Pauper.
Saint Austyn speaks of such daunces and plays as was used in his time / when
christian people was much meddled with hethen people / and by old custom and
example of hethen people used unhonest daunces and plays that by old time
were ordained to styre the people to lecherye and to other sins. And so if
dau^synge and playnge now on the holy days styre men and wymen to pride to
lechery glotonye and sleuthe / to over long waking on nyghtes / and to
idleness on the work days / and other sins / as it is right lykely yt they
do now in our days than ben they unlawful both on the holy day and on the
work day. And against all such spoke saint Austyn / but against honest
dau^ces and plays done in due time and in good manner on the holy day spoke
saint Austyn not. Dives. Contra te. We find in holy write y^ god badde his
people tormente their souls and give them to sorrow and mourning on the holy
days. Dies expiacionu erit celeberimus et vocabit sanctus affligetisque aias
vra^s in eo. Ois aia que afflicta no^ fuerit die hoc peribit de populis suis.
Leuitici.xxiij. Than it seems that god will that men give them rather to
mournyng in the holy day than to myrthe or to welfare. Pauper. Solomon says
Spes que differt affligit aiam. prouer. xiij. The hope the desire and the
longing that is delayde tormenteth the ^oule. For the more that man or woman
longs after a thing / the more it is disease till he has his disease and his
longing. But now it is so that the rest the mirth the ease and the welfare yt
god has ordained in the holy days / is a token of endless rest Joy mirth
and welfare in the bliss of heaven that we hope to have without end. For there
men shall halowe without end from all manner trauayl thought and care. And
therefore as I said first / god will that we think on the holy day of the
rest Joy and bliss that the holy day betokens / and have it in thought /
in desire / in longyng and hope to come thereto. And so tormente our souls by
longing and by sorowynge By longing after the endelesse rest / and by
sorowynge yt for sin our desire is so long delayde. In this manner god will
that every man and woman tormente his soul in the holy day / by love loving
to god ward / and by sorrow for gods offense. Not to show great heaviness
outward / and to do bodily penance in any great holy day. More over my
friend god badde not that the Jews should tormente their souls in every holy
day / but only in one solempnyte that was called the feste of clensynge and of
forgyuenesse. For that day god for gave the Jews the great sin that they
did when they made them a calf of gold and silver / and worshypped that calf
as god / and called it their god / notwithstanding all the wondres that god
had shows them a little before / ledynge them thrughe the read see dry
foot / and drenched king Pharao and all his oost / and spoke to them openly by
voys of angellys from above the mount of Synay in thondre and lightening / in
fire and smoke / and clouds / full grymme in voices of trompettes and of
claryon full dredefull to here. And for asmoche as that grievous sin was first
forgyuen them in that day / and they were first that day made clean from that
great sin / therefore god badde them that day for Joy of forgyuenesse. He
badde them also that day tormente their souls for sorrow of yt grievous sin
/ and for their unkindness that they should have mind of their sins and be
ashamed thereof. And also have in mind gods goodness against their
shrewednesse / and thank him thereof. This day was the tenth day of Septembre.

Dives. Where fyndeste thou that god badde men make merry and to fare well in
the holy day. Pauper. In the same place of holy writ Leuitici.xxiij. Where
we find that god badde the children of Israel take branches and bows of
palm trees and of the fairest trees that they might find / and make them
tabernacles and dwell therein seven days togydre every year ones / and there
to make merry before their lord god / in the mind that god made them to
dwell in tabernacles in deserte.xl. year and there saved them and keep them
fro woe. And Esdras the prophet said to gods people. This day is hallowed to
our lord god / weep ye not ne mourn ye not / ete ye good metes and fat /
and drink ye good drynkes / and ye that may send ye part to them that may
not / ne have no power whereof to dyght them mete or drink. Be ye not sorry for
it is gods holy day. Gaudiu^ etenim dn^i est fortitudo vestra. The Joy of
our lord is your strength / that is to say. God is glad that ye be strong
/ glad and merry. Neemie.viij. And therefore fasting is forboden in the
sunday. Di.xxx. Si quis tanquod and^ Si quis presbiter. Where fasting is
forboden in the sunday. And also there should no fasting be used much from
Ester to Pentecoste that is wytsontyde for Joy of Crystus resurreccyon and of
our salvation. Di.lxxvi. Ieiunia. Et de con.di.i. Ieiunium. Dives. Where
fyndest thou in holy writ that daunces and songs ben lefull and plesaunt to
god. Pauper. We find Exodi.xv. That when the childern of Israel were passed
the read see dry foot / so that the water stood in either side of them right
up as a wall / and god had drenched king Pharao and all his oost / than
Moses made a merry song and praysynge to god / which song begins thus in
latin. Cantemus dn^o gloriose. em^ magnificatus est. Than Marye the sister of
Aaron took her timber in her hand / and all wymen that might took her tymbers
to her hondes / and went daunsynge and singing the same song praysynge and
worshyppynge our lord god. We find also in the second book of kings in the
vi. chapter / that when Dauyd should fetch gods hutche in to Jerusalem
Dauyd and all the people of Israel went therewith and played in all manner
mynstralles / and song and dau^ced and sprange for Joy / and so praised and
worshyped god. But Mychol Saul's daughter and Dauydes wife scorned Dauyd for his
dau^synge and for his spryngynge and said / that it was not semely to a king
so to spring and dau^ce as a knaaf before the people and before her maidens.
Dauyd said to her I shall play and dau^ce before my lord god that has chosen
me to be a king and put thy fader and all thy kyn from the crown. I shall
play before my lord god / and put me in lower degree for his love / and ben
low and meke in mine own sight to please god yt made me king And for that
Mychol scorned so Dauyd for his spryngynge and his dau^synge and his lowenesse
/ therefore god made her barayne yt she had never child as y^ book says there.
Also god gladded his people that was in much care and trybulacyon and said /
yet shall maidens make merry in song and dau^synge / and old folk togydre.
For I shall torn their care in to Joy / and glad them and conforte them of
their sorrow. Ieremye.xxxi. Dives. It may well be as thou say. For mirth and
gladness conforteth men in gods service / and heaviness dulleth and lets
all manner liking. Pauper. Therefore Dauyd says. Seruite dn^o in leticia. Serve
ye our lord in myrthe and gladness. But two things my friend must be kept
in gods service and in good living / sadness and gladness. Sadness in
chere and in doing. Gladness in heart thinking. Sadness without sorynesse
of malice / of wrath / hate / and of envy And gladness without folly and
rybaudrye. And therefore my friend I pray you saddeth well / but baddeth not.
Be always glad / but neuermore made by no folly. Always sad / always glad
/ so that your gladness and your sadness be always meddled with liking and
love of god / and with devotion.

Caplm.xix.
Dives. Why ben these three commandments called the co^maudementes of the
first table. Pauper. For when god gave Moses the law in the mount of Synay.
He took him the.x. commandments written in two tables of stone In the first
table were written the three first commandments which techen us how we
should worshypp our god and love him above all thing. And therefore they ben
called the commandments of the first table / both for worthyne s;se of
themself / and for they were written in y^ first table. In the second table
were written other.vij. commandments / that techen us to love our even
christian as our self / and ben called the commandments of y^ second table
And so all the.x. commandments ben comprehended and closed in y^ two
commandment of charity. The first commandment of charity is this / ye you
shall love thy lord god with all thyn heart / with all thy soul / with all thy
mind with all thy might. When he says you shall love thy god with all thyn
heart excludes all manner of ydolatrye / yt is forboden by the first
commandment that no man set his heart / ne his faith / ne his trust in no
creature more than in god / ne against gods worship. For who so loves well an
other he has kyndely a trust and a faith in him. And after that he loves /
so he trusts. And there he trusts most / commonly he loves most. And
therefore god badde that you sholdest love him with all thyn heart / yt is to
say with all thy faith / so that you set all thy faith and thy trust in him
before all other / as in him that is almighty and may best help at need. And
therefore the first commandment of these three is applied pryncypally to the
fader almighty. Also god byddeth that you love him with all thy soul / that is
to say / as saint Austyn says with all thy will / without contradicco^n /
that thy will be not contrary to his will but always confourmed to his will.
And in yt he byddeth yt you take not his name in vain. But as you haste taken
the name of Christ / and art called christian / so confourme thy will / thy life
/ and thy speech to y^ will of Christ / that you will no thing / ne do no
thing / ne say no thing against his will by thy will and thy wyttynge / ne
make none oath ne auowe against his will and his wor^hyp. And tho that thou
haste made to his worship keep them / and hope sykerly that if thou fulfylle
gods will here in earth / he shall fulfill thy will in heaven. And look that
thou spend all thy life and thy being to his worship and in his love. And
than love thou hy^ with all thy soul / in which pryncypally is thy life and
thy being. And therefore if thou spend not thy life and thy being in his love
/ thou love him not with all thy soul / and thereto thou take his name in
vain / for his name is. Qui est. That is to say. He that is. For all thing
that is takes his being of him. And therefore if y^ spend thy life and thy
being in sin and vanyte / you take his name of being in vain. Also look
that thou spend all thy wit in his love / that you study to know the treuth
/ that is Crystus name. For he says. Ego sum verytas. And so study to flee
falshode and folly by help of Christ gods sone yt is al wytty And therefore
the second commandment is applied to y^ second person in trynyte / yt is
the sone all wytty. Also he byddeth yt you love him with all thy mind without
forgetynge of his benefyces and his gifts to the and to mankind. And in that
he byddeth the to keep well the holy day which is ordained pryncypaly that
men should than withdraw her thoughts and their mind from the world / and
think than on god and on heavenly things. Than think on their own
unkindness and of gods goodness as I said first. And therefore he says.
Memento. Think that thou halowe well the holy days. that is to say / love
god with all thy thought and with all thy mind / that thou be in will no thing
to think against his plesaunce / and that thou have liking to think of him by
grace of the holy ghoost / to whom the third commandment is applied /
without whom as saint Poule says. We may think no good thought. The first
commandment is applied to the fader almighty that may best help at need. For
mawmettes and ydolatrye may not help. The second commandment is applied to
the sone alwytty / whose name is treuthe and sovereign wisdom. For he knows
all / he may not be dysceyued / and treuth should not be taken in vain / but
always worshyped and wisely mayntened The third commandment is applied to
the holy ghoost / which is called Para^litus / that is to say comforter For
the holy day is ordained for to comfort both the soul and the body / and to
comfort man and best. And the holy ghoost comfort us in sorrow and care /
and he is bote of every bale. He gives rest after trauayll / he is solace in
disease / and he abateth careful thoughts / and gives peace and rest in
heart. And therefore the prophet says to him Cogitacio hominis confitebitur
tibi. et reliquie cogitaciones diem festum agent tibi. Man's thought shall ben
known to the his myschyues / and the remenauntes of his thoughts shall make
an holy day to the in y^ sunday and other festes. Secundu^ multitudine^
dolorum meorum in cord meo. consolaco^nes tue letificaueru^t anima^ mea^.
Lord says he / after the multitude of sorrows in mine heart / so thy confortes
have gladded my soul. For the holy ghoost byddeth that men should rest from
their trauayles here in the holy days and after in endelesse bliss.

Caplm.xx.
ALso my friend / as the gospel says Marci.xij. Ye shall love god with all
your heart / and with all your soul / with all your mind / and with all your
might / That is to say / as saint Bernarde says. Ye must love him. Dulciter
/ prudenter / fortiter. Swetely / wisely / myghtely. Swetely with all your
heart / with all your soul / that ye have liking in him passing all other.
Wisely with all your mind and with all your thought / that ye study and be
besye night and day to do his plesau^ce and to flee his offense. Also ye must
love him myghtely and stedfastely / that neither well ne woe depart you from
his love. And therefore says saint Poule yt no trybulaco^n hongre ne thruste /
hete ne cold / life ne death / ne no creature should depart us from the
charity in Christ if we loved him as we should love. Ye shall love your god with
all your heart / so that ye love nothing but for him and in him. Ye shall love
him with all your soul / so that ye spend all your will and all your
affecco^n in his love. Ye shall love hy^ with all your mind / so that ye
spend all your thoughts in his love. Ye shall love him with all your might /
so that ye spend all your myghtes in his love / so that ye assente to
nothing / ne think nothing / ne do nothing against his plesau^ce / ne that
should let his love / ne depart you from his love. The first commandment
techeth us to love him myghtely. The second techeth us to love him wisely. The
third recheth us to love hy^ swetely in ease and rest of heart. By the first
commandment god techeth us faith and right believe. By the second he techeth
us hope. For as he says by the prophet. Qm^ in me sperauit liberabo eum.
protegam eu^ qm^ cognouit nomen meu^. For he hoped in me I shall deliver him /
and I shall defend him for he has known my name. Beatus vir cuius est nomen
dn^i spes eius. et non respexit in vanytates. et insanias falsas. p^o.xxxix.
Blessed be that man whose hope is in the name of our lord / and has taken
head to no vanytees / ne to no false witnesses for to forswere him / and to
take gods name in vain. For as saint Poule says. There is no name in which
we may be saved but in gods sweet name Ihesus. And therefore they that have
gods name in worship may have syker hope to be saved. And tho yt have it in
despyte ought to be in great dread. By the third commandment god techeth us
charity. For charity and good love is rest in every woe and trauayll / for love
makes trauayll light and easy / that should elly^ be full uneasy. By the first
co^mau^deme t of charity we be bound to show love to god in heart / in word
/ in work And therefore god byddeth that we should love him with all our heart
/ with all our soul and mind / that is to say / with all our speech. For
speech outward is a token of thoughts inward. Also he byddeth us love him
with all our myghtes / that it to say with all our works. And so the first
commandment of the first table techeth us to love god with all our heart The
second techeth us to love him with all our word / and show hy^ love in speech
/ for who so loves an other well he will speak good and worship of him that he
loves and be glad to here of his good name and speak of him good and worship
/ and sorry to here his name despised and dyffamed. By the third commandment
we ben taught to show love to god in deed / that is to leave our own
occupaco^ns on ye holy days and give us pryncypally to serve god and to be
occupied with hy^ and do nothing but for his love and to his worship / or for
great need of our self. For who so loves an other well / he will seek a time to
speak with him and to dele with him. And therefore god byddeth us halowe well the
holy days / and attend than well to him and occupye us with him as with our
dear love / that made us of naught / and bought us full dear with his precious
blood / and saves us and keeps us / and gives us all that we have of any
good and fyndeth us all that us needs and much more. And if we love him in
this manner with all our myghtes and deeds and works / and halowe thus the holy
day and the sabbot that he hat boden us halowe. He should give us a sabbot and
rest in heaven / as the prophet Ysaye says / it shall be a sabbot of
sabbottes / y^ is to say endelesse rest betokened by temporel rest in ye holy
day / and month of months that is to say endelesse myrthe betokened and
fygured by temporell mirth in the holy day. Ysaye.lxvi. Amen.

Here ends the third commandment / and begins the fourth.
Caplm Primu^.
Dives. As me thinks now thou haste declared the commandments of the
first Table full well and parfyghtely to man's soul. Now I pray the for
gods sake for to perform that thou haste begonnen / and will declare to me
now the commandments of the second Table / that I may the better know the
laws of god / and the more plesauntly serve my god / and keep me the more
peasyble in charity with mine even christian. For as I have understood / all the
seven commandments of the second Table ben knytte togydre in the second
commandment of charity which byddeth us love our even christian as our self.
Pauper. Mankind has two begynnynges. The first beginning and begynner is
god. And the second beginning and begynner is the fader and the mother. By the
first co^mau dement of the first table we be caught to worship god above al
things / as him that is beginning of us and of all creatures. By the first
commandment of the second table we be taught to worship fader and mother that been our beginning next after god. And therefore he says in the first
commandment of the second table. Honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam. That is
to say / worship thy fader and thy mother. By the commandments of the first
table he taught us to love god above all thing. By the commandments of the
second table he techeth us to love our even christian as our self. And for as
much as charity is most showed by worshyppynge and helping of our even
christian. Therefore he begins by techynge of worship y^ ought to be done to
them that we owe by way of charity most to worship after god and most to
help that is fader and mother. And therefore he says. Honora patrem tuum et
matrem tuam. Worship thou thy fader and thy mother. By which commandment we
ben bounden to help our bodily fader and mother at need and be to them buxom
and meke / and flee their dyspleasau^ce / not despise them / not anger them
vnresonably / not banne ne warye them / ne harm them / ne scorn them for none
age / for none unclean s;se / for no wantenesse ne folly that they say or do /
but supporte them in their age and feblenesse / as they supported us in our
youth / and help us / and kept us in our feblenesse / when we could not ne
might not help our self We find Genesis.ix. That Noe had three sons. Sem.
Cham. and Iaphet. When the flood was done it happed that their fader Noe drank
wine so that he was drunk / for he knew not the might of the wine For before
the flood men drank no wine ne ete no flesh. And when Noe was thus drunk
/ his myddell sone Cham found him lyggynge bare / so yt he might see his preuy
members / and anon he laughed his fader to scorn and would not cover his
fader but went and told it to his brethern in Iapynge and scornynge his
fader. But his brethern would not see that nyce sight / but turned their face
from their fader and cast a clothe upon him and covered hyw honestly. When Noe
awoke and wyste what his myddell sone Cham had done to him / he was wroth with
hy^ and cursed Chanaan Chams sone and all that should come of him and made hy^
thrall and bound to Sem and Iaphet / and to their childern after them And thus
for scornyng and un worship that the sone did to the fader began first
boundage and thraldom and was confermed of god. Dives. Sythen Cham did y^
sin and not Chanaan which was yet but a child / why cursed Noe y^ child
Chanaan and not Cham y^ childs fader. Pauper Noe would not curse Cham in his
own person / for god had blessed him in his person with his brethern anon
after y^ flood / and therefore he cursed Chanaan his sone / and him in his sone
/ and punysshed him in his sone and all that should come of him. For it was
gods dome / that right as he had done shame to his fader / so his childern
should be shame and shenshyp to him. And as Noe had no Joy of him / so
should he have no Joy of his childern. Dives. The reason is good and rightful
/ say forth. Pauper. Therefore Solomon says. Oculum qui subsannat patre^. et
despicit partum matris sue. suffodient eum corui de torrentibus et demones.
Prouerbiorum.xxx. The eye that scorneth his fader / and despyseth the birth of
his mother / rauyns of the brokes / that is to say / fendes of hell brokes
shall delue out and pyke out that eye. And therefore he says in an other place.
Honora patre^ tuum et gemitus matris tue ne obliuiscaris. Memento quo niam nisi
per illos non fuisses. et retribue illis quomodo illi tibi. Eccle. vij. Worship
thou thy fader / and for yette uot the syghynges of thy mother ne what pain she
had when she bare the of her body. Think that but by them thou had not
ben / and yield them and do to them as they did to the. And god badde him
self in the old law / that who so cursed or waryed his fader or mother / he
should be slain. Leuitici.xx.

Caplm.ij.
Dives. Many childern would full feign see their fader and mother deed y^ they
might have her heritage and live at their own governance. And often when they
may not have it by their good will ne by their death / they will have it by plee
and by maystrye. Pauper. Such childern full late shall thryue / and they shall
have full little Joy and worship of her own childern / but much shame and
shenshypp. For as Solomon says. He y^ cursed his fader or his mother or
dyseaseth them / his lantern shall be quenched in y^ mids of derkenesses
that is to say / either he shall have no ne air / or if he have he shall be
with out worship. For the heritage says he / to which childern hasten fast
in this manner / shall want blessyng and grace of god in the last end.
Prouer.xx. And in an other place he says / that who so withdraws any thing
from his fader and from his mother / and says it is no sin / he is as wicked
as a manqueller. Particeps homicidie est. Prouer.xxviij. Also we find in the
second book of kings.xv.c^. That Absolon the sone of Dauyd would have put
his fader Dauyd out of his kingdom / and he drove him out of the cite of Ierlm
barefote / for he came so suddenly on him / that Dauyd was feign to flee and
save his life. Soon after Absolon gaaf battle to his fader in the field / but
as god would he was ouercomen and much of his folk slain / both by sword
and by wild bestes. Than Absolon fled riding on his mule bare heded. And as
he rode under an oak / his here that was full long and full fair smote up
among the bows / and there it fastened so that the mule passed forth in his
rennynge / but Absolon henge stylle by his here till that Ioab that was chyef
captain and prince of the oost of Dauyd came to him and smote him through the
heart with three speres / and made him forth be stoned to death / that was the
most dyspyteous death in the law. And so Absolon y^ was than the fairest man
living / for haste that he had to the heritage and wrong y^ he did to his
fader / he lost both his heritage and his life. Also Adony his brother would
have been king whiles his fader Dauyd lived and Dauyd pryued him of the kingdom
for ever and made Solomon that was than not.xi. year old king. And afterwarne
Adony was slain for he would have been king against his faders ordenau^ce.
Therefore god badde in the old law Deuteronomy.xxi. That if there were any vnbuxom
child y^ would not obey to his fader and mother / they should led them to the
rulers of the Cite and say to them in this wise. Our sone is bold and proud
/ he will not here our techyng ne our byddyng but he gives him to riot glotony
and lechery / and to great festes and fare. And god badde that all the people
of the cite or of that town should slay y^ vnbuxom child with stones in
example of all other. For when yt young folk wexe rebelle against fader and
mother and give them to such riot and welfare and idleness / but they ben
chastysed and withstonde in the beginning / they shall ashame the comynte of
the people / by robbery / murdre / and manslaughter / by evil and wicked
company / and make rebellyon and rysyng against their soueraynes / and so be
cause of destruccyon of the land of the Cite and of the comynte. Also
Mathei.xv. Christ in the gospel repreueth all tho that by ypocresye withdraw
needful living from fader or mother under color of gods worship and holy
church. And he repreued tho men of holy church that so enfourme the childern
to say to their fader and mother that they may not worship god and holy church
for the cost that they do to sustain them self / and so make fader and
mother to live in myschyef / y^ men of holy church may live in delyces.

Caplm.iij.
NOt oonly by the commandment of god ben we bounden and taught to worship and
to help our fader and our mother / but also by example in kind as the maystre
tells of propretees. That when the storke that is called Ciconia in latin /
as she has brought forth her birds to flight / both the male and the female
ben bycomen full feeble for trauayl that they had in the bredynge and bringing
forth of their birds / and ben so feeble that they may not well help them
self. For both the male and the female sytten by dyuer s;e times on the eggs
/ and change their trauaylle in bredynge of their birds / and in fetchyng of
mete and drink for them self and for their birds. And therefore when the
birds ben grown and may flee / they fetch mete to their fader and mother in
to the neste as long time as they trauayle^ to bring forth their birds till
they be releuyd and may travail to help them self. Also he tells that there
is a bird that is called a Pellycane. Pellicanus. And there is a great enemyte
between the Pellycane and the addre. The addre wayteth when the Pellycane has
birds / and when she is out of the neste to get mete to her and to her birds
/ the addre crepeth up in the neste and sleeth the birds. And when the
Pellycane comes again / and fyndeth her by^des slain in this manner / she
mourns three days and three nyghtes for the death of her birds. The third
day she sets her again over her birds / and with her bylle she smyteth her
self in the side / and spryngeth her blood on her birds. And by the virtue of
her blood she rayseth them fro death to life. By the bledynge she wexeth so
feeble that she may not travail to feed her self. Than some of her birds for
love and pity put them for to travail and feed their mother / and some care not
for her / but oonly feed them self. When the mother is amended and waxen
strong / tho birds that helps her she loves and cheryssheth them / and the
other that would not help her / she beteth and bylleth and casts them out of
her company.

Dives. This commandment byddeth us worshypp fader and mother / and that we
may do without any cost and with lytyl travail For we may rise against them /
knele to them and take their blessing and speak to them with reverence and so
keep the commandment. Pauper. The commandment byndeth us not only to
worship fad and mod with such reverence doing / but also to worship the^ with
help at need. Dives. Where fyndest you that help at need is called worship.
Pauper In the first pystle yt saint Poule wrote to the bishop Thymothee.v.
Where he badde that he should worship very wydowes / that is to say / he
should sustain them with goods of holy church. And he called there very
wydowes that had no good to be sustained with of their own. And if that she
had childern / or fader or mother or whereof to live / he badde that she should
learn to rule her husholde and help fader and mother as they helped her. And in
the same chapter he byddeth that prestes and men of holy church that rule well
her subgettes should have double worship of the people / that is to say the
gloss / that the people should obey to them and do them reverence and find them
all that them needs / and namely to them that travail in prechynge and
techynge of the gospel. Dives. It is only folly when folk for age and
feblenesse may not ne can not help themself ne govern themself / than to be
taken to their childrens goueruau^ce of the husholde / and put themself in
keeping of their childern and there governance. Pauper. More semely it is that
they put them in their childrens governance and keeping than in strangers.
Namely if they have founden them good and kind to them before. But for any
trust in there childern I would not counsel them fully to dysmytten them of
her good But always reserve the lordshypp to themself / and their childern in
danger And therefore Solomon says. Audite me magnati et om^s populi and^.
Eccl. xxxiij. Ye great men and governors of holy church / and ye all people /
harken now to my saw / give to no man ne woman power upon the by thy self.
Neither to sone ne to daughter ne to brother ne to friend / give not a way to
other men thy good and thy catell For hapely it may repent the / and than
shall thou pray to have help of thyn own good and thou shall none have.
Melius est vt filij tui rogent te. quod te respicere in manibus filiorum
tuorum. Ecclesiastici.xxxiij. It is better says he that thy childern pray the
and ask help of the / than you look in the hondes of thy childern for help. I
find that an old man bytoke to his sone his household and gaaf him all that
he had to keep him well in his age First he lay with his sone in the
chamber / at the last he was put out of the chamber and laid him behind the
spear at y^ halle door / for he cought and roughed so / that his sone and his
sons wife might have no rest by hy^ in the chamber. And when he lay so nygh
the halle door / he had much cold and called to him his sons sone a little
child / and badde him go to his fader and ask of him some clothes to keep him
with from cold. The child did the erande / and the fader took the child an
old sack. Have said he / and bydde him lay this on him. Nay fader said the
child / but kytte it in too and send ye him y^ half and keep ye to you the
other half tylle to the time when ye be old that ye may than cover you
therewith and keep you from cold. Not long sith this caas byfel in Colchestre.
There was an old man somdele lettred / which bytoke his sone in his age all
y^ household and gaaf him all that he had for to keep him well in his age.
First he lay in the chamber with his sone / after he was put allone in an out
chamber in the yerde / and was served full evil both at bed and at board. On
a day he prayed his sons wife to le ne him half a busshell to mete by a
certain thing / but he would not tell her what he should mete. She took him
half a busshell having great wondre what he should do therewith. He went in
to his chamber and shette the door to him. He took a few pens and halfpens and
ferthynges that he had and put them in to the craueyses of the halfbusshell /
and soon after he took her again her halfbusshell. She looked besely in the
halfbusshell to know what he had moten therewith. And than she found that
money hanging in the craueyses and clyftes of y^ half busshel / and she wend
that he had moten money by the vessel / and went and showed it to her
husbonde / and he wend the same. For his fader kept ever a great hutche
besides his bed well locked and was right heavy / but his sone might not know
what theri^ was / but after this deed he hoped that therein had be much money.
And in hope of that money / he and his wife kept well and honestly his fader
in to his death. When he was deed / he brake up the hutche / for keye found he
(...) thereto. And than found he in that hutche but earth and stones and a
betyll lyenge over it with a scrowe thereon / in which was written in this
manner. With this betyll be they beten that her childern her good shall lete^
And give away all their thing / and gone them self on beggynge.

Dives. Yet contra te Christ says in the gospel. Qui no^ odit patre suu^ et
matre^ sua^. non potest meus esse discipulus. Luce.xiij. He that hates not his
fader and his mother / he may not be my dyscyple. But that we be bound to hate
we be not bound for to worshypp it ne to help it. Therefore than we be neither
bound for to worship fader ne mother / ne to help them at need. Pauper.
Christ said tho words when nyghe all the world was hethen people and of false
believe / when nyghe all the faders and moders were in false believe and in
dedely sin. And therefore Christ said tho words. Not that childern should
hate the persons of their faders and moders / but they should hate their false
believe and their wicked living / and so we must all if we will be saved / we
should love every man and woman and hate their sin And in as much as fader
and mother withstonde us in gods way / we should hate their malice and
forsake their wicked living and follow god and be besye to draw fader and
mother after us in gods way by good techynge and ensample. Dives. Yet contra
te. Christ says in the gospel. Veni seperare hominem aduersus patre^ suum et
aduersus matrem suam. Mathei.x. Pauper. In gods cause and in treuthe man and
woman ought to forsake fader and mother if they withstand gods cause / and
hold against the treuthe. And so Christ came for to depart man and woman fro
their fader and mother that stood in false believe against god. Christ came not to
put full hate between man and his fader and mother / but for to make man and
woman to forsake fader and mother for gods sake / if they will let the fro
god. And therefore he says in the same place. He that loves fader and mother
more than me he is not worthy to come to me / we should love fader and mother
and help them at need / though they be he then and never so wicked / but we
should love god more than them. And if we may not please god and them also /
we should offend them and please god / and always love their person and hate
their sin. And be besy to amend them by good enformacyon with love and
meekness and reverence. Dives. Yet contra te. Saint Poul says. Non debent
filij parentibus thesaurizare. sed parents filij. Scdo ad Little.xiij. Childern
ought not to gadre togydre tresoure to their faders and moders / but faders and
moders ought to gadre tresoure to their childern. Therefore than it seems that
childern should not care for their fader and mother / but fader and mother should
care for their chyldern. Pauper Each of them ought to care for other But more
the fader and mother for the child / than the child for fader and mother.
Dives. Why so. Pauper For the child is toward and by common course of kind is
semynge longer to live than his fader and mother And his childern should be his
faders childers childern and his moders. And so fader and mother should not care
only for their own childen / but also by way of kind they ought to care for
their childers childern / and have more affecco^n to their childern / than
their childern for them / and more care for their childern than their childern
for them. And therefore right as the rote in the tree by way of kind gives
more moisture and virtue up to the tree and to the croppe / than the tree or
the croppe gives down to the rote. So by way of kind the fader and the
mother must be more besy to help their childern and to ordeyne for them / than
the childern for fader and mother that sooner by way of kind shall deye.
Nevertheless right as the croppe refressheth the rote by moisture of dew and
of rain and bysshadoweth the rote for the hete of the son / so ought the
childern to refresshe fader and mother at their need / and keep them from
myschyef as much as they may in good manner and keep them well and honestely
Not for to make them rich / neither nourysshe them in delyces.

Caplm.vi.
Dives. when man or woman enters in to relygyon / he is deed against the
world. Therefore it seems than that by his relygyon he is vnbounden from this
commandment And he that is not bound to help his fader or mother at need /
for when he is professed in relygyon he may not give / for he y^ naught have /
naught may give. Pauper. Man and woman by this commandment is bound to two
things / to reverence fader and mother / and to help them at need. As for the
reverence the relygyouse is as much bound or more as the seculer in time and
place and when and where he may do it. But as for the second point / that is
to help them at need / if his fader and mother have not whereby to live / ne be
of power to get their living honestly / the sone ought not to enter in such
relygyon there he may not help them / for if he do he may be cause of their
death. But if his fad and mod have enough to live by / he may enter in to
relygyon though fader and mother forbede it him. He shall not spare for love /
for prayer / for blessing / ne for curse. For as saint Austyn says in Epla ad
Letu^. This commandment byndeth there that things of more charge and of more
prouffyte let it not Dives. Yet contra te. If the relygyouse keep not this
commandment because of his religyon / he does amys in taking of his
relygyon. Pauper That is soth. Dives. I suppose yt he never after see his fader
ne mother / ne do them no help ne reverence / how keeps he than this
commandment. Pauper. Though he see them never after / ne help them at need
ne do to them reverence / if his will be good to help them at need and to do
them reverence if he might come to them himself / or by any person / yet he
kept ye commandment. For though this commandment byndeth always man and
woman / yet it byndeth not for always As clerks tellen / not for every time ne
for every place / ne for every cause / but only for such cause time and place
when they may do it lefully. And thus bind al commandments affyrmatyfe But
commandments negatyfe bind every time and for every time. Dives What if
fader and mother fall in myschyef after yt their sone is professed in relygyon
/ ought not her sone to forsake relygyon and help his fader and mod in their
myschyef. Pauper. Some clerks tellen yt for as much as he is deed against the
world by his professyon / therefore he is dyscharged fro cure of fader and
mother / as he is dyscharged thereof by bodily death / and he ought not to go out
of his relygyon / but dwell still under obedyence of his prelate.
Nevertheless he ought to do his dylygence to help them saving his obedyence
and honest of his relygyon. In su^. con. libro.iij. ti.xxxiiij. q^.CC.xlix.
Dives. As I said first. He that naught have naught may give / but the
relygyouse makes so his professyon yt he may no thing have in propre How
should he than help either fader or mod / or any other of his kyn Pauper. If
he be a relygyous mendycant / he may beg for his fader and mother as he does
for himself / and so releue and help them by me^nes alms And if he do so /
without doubt god shall send hy^ enough because of his charity / and he shall
fare the better for them both in body and soul. And if he be a relygyous
possessyoner endewed by temporal goods / he may releue them in the same manner
/ or else by alms of the house which is endewed pryncypaly to help ye nedy
/ and namely fad and mod. For saint Poule says yt who so have no cure if his
next / he is worse than Jews sarasynes or paynymes.

Dives. As they say the goods of holy church may not be dealed ne given in
to the use of seculers. Pauper. God forbede else. For all that holy church
has it is given to holy church / or else purchased by substance of temporel
lords to help christian people in myschyef. And therefore holy chirches goods
ben called the goods of the poor and of the nedy.xvi. q^.i. Decime. et cao.
Quino. Dives. These relygyou s;e possessyoners endewed in so great richesses /
say that they be the goods of the house. And therefore none of them may give
any thing of the goods without common assente of the covent and leave of their
sovereign. And so me thinks that it is full hard to any relygyouse
possessyoner to help either fader or mod by goods of his house. For the
relygyouse may scarsely help themself by goods of his house / he shall full
evil or may releue his fader or mother by goods of his house. For redely he
shall find both his prelate and his covent against him / alleggynge
delapydaco^n and waste and pouerte and great need without need. For yet there is
no house that will say that they have enough. Pauper. A sorry lorshyp is it
than the lorshyp of relygyouses that may not in so great. richesses passing
dukes / eerles / barons / releue ye myschyef of their own fader and mother. But
sothely they show well that all their besynesses is to spare / to purchase /
to beg of lords and ladies / and of other men lands and rentes / gold and
silver / not for help of the poor / but for to mayntene their pride and their
welfare. Saint Benett often with good conscience gaaf to the couentes good to
help poorefolke at need. For we read prio. lio. Dyalogorum. That there was a
good simple man dyseased / for he ought a man.xij. shellynges / and he had not
wherewith to pay. He came to saint Benett and prayed him of help Saint Benett
said yt he had naught than for to help him self with / but come again to me
said he after two days / and than I shall help the if I may. Saint Benett for
pity that he had on that man / prayde to god for help. And suddenly he
found lyggynge.xiij. shellynges on the hutche of the covent that was full of
whete which money Saint Benett took and gave to that sorry man / and badde him
pay.xij. shellynges for his debt and.xij. pens over he badde him keep for his
living. And without doubt if Saint Benett had had so much money of the
covent / he should have done the same with the couentes money without assente
of the covent For we find in the same book / that there was a great hongre in
that contree that saint Benett dwelled in And when he saw the folk at
myschyef / he gaaf away nygh all the gods of the covent / so that there was
nothing left in the covent whereby to live but a little oil in a glass. And
than came a man to him whose name was Agapitus / and prayed him for gods sake
to give him a lytyl oil Saint Benett badde the monk that had the oil in
keeping / deliver that oil to that nedy man. The monk for nygardshyp and for
that it was the couentes good would not deliver it to the nedy man. For if he
gave that away he should none leave to the covent. Saint Benett was dysplaysed
and badde an other monk take the vessel of glass with the oil and cast it
ought at the wyndowe for that the monk was so vnobedyent / for the oil when
it was cast out / it fell down more than an hundred foot on cragges and
stones / for the house stood upon an high hylle / and neither the glass brake
ne the oil spylte. Than saint Benett badde the monks take it as it was and
give it to the nedy man. And than before all the monks he vndername the
cellerer of his pride and of his wanbyleue. Than saint Bernarde with his
brethren prayed to god that he would send to them some oil whereby to live.
And anon a tonne that lay there beside void / suddenly was so full of oil
y^ it ra^ne over in the flore. We read also in the life of saint Gregory y^
there came a man and axed saint Gregory alms for gods sake. For he had
lost all his good on the sea / and uneath he escaped with his life. Saint
Gregorye y^ was than but abbot / bad his awmener give him.vi. pens. And he did
so. The same day he came again and axed alms / and had as much. He came again
the third day and alledgyd great pouerte / that he had lost much good and
gate but little again. Saint Gregorye had his procuratour and reuler of the
couentes goods that he should give him his alms. He answerde and said that
there was none thing left but a dysshe of silver in which his mother was wont
to send him mete. Saint Gregorye bad him give the poor man y^ dysshe / and so
he did. This poor man was gods angel in the likeness of a poor man / and
for this alms god made saint Gregory afterward pope of Rome. We find also
in y^ life of saint Frau^cys / that he bad his brethern take y^ clothes of our
ladies altar and give them to y^ poor folk.viij.c. Dives The relygyous said
y^ the gods of y^ covent ben all their gods in common. And therefore may non of
them Iyue away without assent of them all. For by common reule of the law
that touches almoost be approved of all. Quod oe^s tangit. ab hominibus
approbari debet. And by an other reule / there may no man give any other right /
but such right as he has him self. Nemo potest plus viris transfer in
aliu^ qua^ sibi competere dinoscitur. And therefore sythen no person of the
covent has any right in goods of the couentes / therefore none of them may
give any alms of the couentys goods ne none other good without assent of them
all / or of the more part. For what thing is any monks of the covent / it is
the couentys. And what so he gets / it is the couentys. Quia quic^d
acquiritur monacho. acquirit monasterio. Pauper. By such ypocresye under the
color of pouerte they mayntene their pride and their auaryce / and occupye
greter lordshyppes than do many dukes earls and barons to great hyndrynge of
the land and great disease of the poor people. For that god ordained to be
common to help at need or all men at need / they say y^ it is theyrs and no
man's else. So y^ four men of relygyon in one house might spend.xx. thousand
mark by their will and by there common opinion / all y^ good should neither
torn to help of the land ne of the poor people / but al to help the poor
covent. Dives Say to my reasons. Pauper. Thy reasons be not worth. For the
goods of relygyouses should be more common than other men's goods to help y^
land and the poor people. And therefore says the law / that common life is
needful to all men / and namely to them that will follow the life of crystus
dyscyples / for as ye air or the light of the son may not be departed / ne
appropred to one place more than to an other. So says he y^ all these worldly
goods should be common in need.xij. q^.i. dilectissimis. And therefore they yt
have most need / have most right to goods of the relygyouse. And ye lordshyp
is no more appropred to the relygyou s;e than to the seculers. For both
seculers and regulers should be helped thereby. But dyspensynge / governance /
and keeping of the goods of holy church is appropred to the relygyous and to
other men of holy church. And therefore says holy writ / that in the
beginning of holy church all things were common to the multitude of all
christian people / not only to the appostles / but to al christian people.
Actuu^.iiij. ca et.xij. q^.i. dilectissimis. And therefore if relygyouse
myspende the goods that be taken to them / and help not the nedy people /
they do cryste^ people great wrong / for they withholde them her right / and
make propre to them that ought to be common to al It is a shame and an over
great abusyon that a man of relygyon shall ride / some with his tenth or with
his twenty / some on an horse of.x. pound in a sadell all gold begone. And for
pouerte that he byndeth him to in his professyon as they say / he may not give
an halfpeny for gods love / ne help his fader and mother at need with out
axynge leave of his sovereign. Sythen god that is sovereign of all bad them
help fader and mother at need. For gods bidding is most to charge. And
saint peter says. Obedire oportet dn^^ magis quod hoi^bus. Men must obey to
g^d more than to man And therefore god may say to such folk of relygyon that
withholden al mess from fader and mother and from the poor people to make her
house and her covent rich / that he said to the masters of the law and to
the phary / seys that were men of relygyon that time. Quare transgredimini
mandatu dei propter tradicione^ vestra^. Why break ye gods commandment for
your statutes and your lore. Math.xv. ir. ca. Dives. It is long sythen I herd
the speak of this matter / pass forth and speak more to purpose.

Caplm.viij.
PAuper. Also we be bound to worship fader and mother / not only in reverence
doing and helping at need / but also in obeyng to her bidding and her lore.
For Solomon says. Audi patre^ tuum qui genuit te. et ne ^tempnas cum sueuerit
matter tua. Prouer.xxiij. Here thy fader that the begat / and despise not when
thy mother is old. That is to say. For any age despise her not / but be low
and meke to her and set her techynge in heart. Iudiciu^ patris audite filij
dilecti and^. Ecclesi.iij. Ye dear childern here ye the dome of your fader /
and do ye so that ye so that ye be saved. He that worshypped his mother / he
makes him a treasoure in the world coming. He that worshyppeth his fader /
he shall have Joy of his childern / and he shall be herd of god in his prayer
/ and he shall live the longer good life. And he that obeys to his fader / he
shall refresshe his mother. He y^ dread god he worshypped fad and mother And he
shall serve him y^ begat him / as his lord in word and in deed and in all
pacyence worship thy fader says he / y^ gods blessyng may come to the / the
fads blessyng says he makes stable and seker the houses of her childern / and
the moders curs destroys her houses dou^ne to ground. He is full of wicked
fame ye forsakes his faders obedyence / and he is a cursed of god that angieth
his mother and will not do her bidding. All these ben Salomones words.
Eccl.iij. And therefore god bad that childern vnbuxum to fader and mod should be
stoned to death. Deuteronomy xxi. We read Jeremy.xxxv. That Ionadab bad his childern
that they never should drink wine / ne make house / ne so we land / ne set
vine. And for that they kept her faders bidding / god said to them by
prophet Ieremye. For that ye have obeyed to the commandment of Ionadab your
fader and kept all his commandments therefore ye kynrede of Ionadab shall not
fail / but all days that kynrede shall be in my sight / and I shall have an
eye to them and help them. But the wicked people of Judah and of Jerusalem that
would not obey to my co^mau dementes I shall destroy.

Caplm.ix.
Therefore saint Poule says. Fili obedite parentib veitris and^. Ye childern
says he obey ye to your faders and mods / for that is ryghtfull thing.
Worship ye fader and mod for this is the first commandment and byheste / that
ye may be well in living long upon earth. And ye faders says he provoke ye
not ne ^tyre ye not your childern to wrath vnrelonably / but nourysshed them
in good lore and in vndernamynge of our lord god. Ad ephe.vi. Christ gods
sone god and lord of all thing / became subgette to Mary his mother and to
Joseph his keeper / geuynge us all ensample to obey and to be buxum and meke to
fader and mother. And Saloman says. Audi fili mi disciplina^ patris tui. My
dear sone here the lore of thy fader / and forsake not the law of thy mother /
and than thou shall have grace and worship. Prouer.i. And as he says in an
other place. He is a fool that scorneth his faders lore. And he that keeps his
faders vndernamynge shall be the more wise and the more slye. Prouer.xv. Also
we must worship fader and mother with good living. For as Solomon says. Dolor
patris filius stultus. The child a fooll is sorrow and shame of his fader.
Confusio patris defilio indisciplinato. Of the sone that is evil taught comes
shame and shen shpy of the fader / and his daughter a fooll and evil taught
shall lose his worship / and the wise daughter shall be good heritage to her
husbonde to save him. And the daughter y^ shendeth her husbonde is in great
despyte and shame of her fader that begat her. Eccl.xxij. The wise sone
glaodeth his fader. The sone that is a fooll in lyuyage is his moders sorrow
Prouer x. Ira patris filius stultus. et dolor matris q^ genuit eum.
Prouer.xvij. The fooll child is wrath and tene of his fader / and sorrow of
his mother that begat him.

Caplm.x.
ANd therefore Solomon says Virga et correpcio ^ribuu^t sapiencia. puer aute^
qui dimittitur voluntati sue confundit matre^ sua^. Prouer.xxix. That is to
say / the yerde vndernemynge given wit and wisdom to the child / and that
child that is leten have his will in his youth shendeth his mother and al his
kynrede. Ensample we have in the first book of kings / of Hely that was
highest bishop and priest of gods law / and of his sons Ophny and Phynees.
That for their fader vndername them not ne chastysed them of their wicked
tatches / for the childerns sin and for his mys suffrau^ce / god took from
him his dygnyte and from all his kynrede for ever and slew his childern and
nyghe all his kynrede in battle. And so the wicked taches of his children
vnworshypped him and all his kynrede for ever / and brought them to endless
shame. And his mys suffrasice was cause of their death and of his shenshyp and
shame to all her kynrede. The sin of his childern was pride / letchery /
lusty fare and glutonye and sleuth / and retchelesnes in gods seruy^e and in
gods law. And therefore good friends and good childern. I pray you all that
ye be buxam and meke to fader and mother / and worship them not only with
reverence doing in deed and speech / but pryncypally with your good living
and your good berynge. For that is the most worship that ye may do to them /
and the most velonye if ye do amys. And do ye so that your faders and moders
and your kynrede may have Iope of you / and than shall ye have Joy of your
childern. For the wise man says. Qui honorat patre^ suu^ iocu^da bit in filijs
suis. Eccl.iij. He that woe shyppeth his fader shall have Joy of his childern.
And who so worshyppeth not his fader and mother in this manner / bat does them
wrath and tene by his myslyuynge and evil taches / he is a cursed of god.
Maledictus qui no^ honorat patre suum et matre^ suam. Deutro.xxvij. A cursed be
that child says he that worshyppeth not his fader and mother with his good
living / but vnworshyppeth them with his myslyuynge. For all the myscheuys of
the child turn to velonye and shame to fader and mother. And all the
goodness and all the good b^rynge of the child turn to great worship of
fader and mother and of all the kynr^de. A great worship it is to fader and
mother when men bless them and praise them for goodness of their childern
and say / blessed be the fader y^ the child begat and blessed be the mod
that him bare. Therefore says the wise man that god worshyppeth the fader in
his childeren when he sees them good childern. Eccl.iij. It is great vylonye
to fader and mother when men curse them and deprayue them for wickedness of
their childeren. And therefore the wyle man says. Non iocunderis in filijs
impijs. Have thou no Iope ne liking in thy childern if they be shrewes and
dread not god. It is better says he to have one good child / than a thousa^de
childern shrewes / and better to dye without than to leave after them shrewed
childern Eccl.xvi. For as he says Sapiencie..iiij. All the childern that come
of wicked folk shall be witnesses of wickedness against their fader and mother
/ when they shall be challenged of their wickedness at the dome For the fader
and the mother shall answer than for their own wickedness and for their
childerns wyckedne s;se. But the wise man says. If thou have childern teache
them well / and bow them and make them simple and meke in their youth. If
thou have daughters / keep well their bodies and honestly / but show them no
glad chere / be not to homely with them. Eccl.vij. While a trce is a small
spring it may be bowed as men will have it. But when it is full woxen it will
not be bowed. So may the child in the youth with a little twygge be chastysed
and made low and meke. But when he is woxen and roted in pride and in mysuse
of living / it is full hard to low him or to amend him. And therefore the
wise man says. Qui parcit virge odit fil^u^. and qui diligit iliu^ instanter
erudit. Prouer.xiij. He that spares the yerde hates his sone / and he that
loved his sone techeth him and chastyseth him besyly. Ensample we have in kind
of the egle / which of all fowls may see ferthest / and is myghtyest in sight
/ in so much that he may see and look against y^ son when it shyneth most
bryghtest without blemysshynge of the eye. And when she has bryddes and they
be full woxen she does hem look against the son. and tho that look well against
the son without blemysshynge of ye eye / them she loves and cheryssheth. And
them that will not ne may not look against the son / or blemysshe their eye in
so king against the son / she beteth them and bylleth them. And but if they
amend them / she casts them out of the neste / and puts them out of her
company as for none of her bryddes Thus should faders and moders teache their
childern to have thereyr up to god y^ is the son of ryghtwysnesse / and take heed to gods law by ensample of Tobye / which said to his sone. All the
days of thy life have thou god in mind / and beware that thou assente to no
sin / ne leave not gods commandment. Tobie.iiij. And therefore Solomon
says. Eccl.vi. That the wicked man that looks not up to the son of
ryghtwysnesse is so blent with derkene s;se of sin / y^ he wot not what is
good neither what is wicked. And therefore says he in the next chapter wisdom
with rychesses is more profitable than without rychesses / and it profyteth
most to them y^ see the son / y^ is to say to them y^ have an eye to the
son of ryghtwylnesse / that is god. For as Solomon says. Oculi ^apteutis in
capite eius. Eccl.ij. The eyes of the wise man be always in his head. That is
to say in christ y^ is head of holy church and of all things And Dauyd
says. Sicut oculi seruorum in manibus dn^orum suorum. et sicut oculi ancille
in manibus dn^e sue. it a oculi nossri ad dn^m deum nostru^ donec misereatur
nostri. As the servants have their eyes to the hands of there lord / and as
the maid in chamber has her eyes to the hands of her lady. So must we have
our eyes up to our lord god / tylle he will have mercy on us.

Caplm.xi.
Dives. Reason gives that men should teache there childeren gods law and good
thewes / and for to take heed to god y^ made us all of naught / and bought us
so dear But now men say that there should no leude folk entremete them of
gods law / ne of the gospel / ne of holy write / neither to conne it ne to
teache it. Pauper. This is a foul error and full peryllous to man's soul For
every man and woman is bound after his degree to do his besynes to know
gods law that he is bound to keep. And faders and moders / godfaders and
godmoders be bound to teache their childern gods law / or else do them to
be taught. And therefore god says. Eru^t vba hec and^. These words that I
bydde the this day should be in thyn heart. Thou shall tell them and teache
them to thy childern Thou shall think thereon sitting in thy house among thy
folk. And when you ghost by the way / when thou ghost to sleep / and when you
aryseste thou shall bind them as a token in thyn hand and in thyn deed / in
thyn work they should be always steryng before thyn eyes of thyn heart. Thou
shall write them in thy dressholde and in thy doors of thyn house / that is to
say when thou come in / and when thou ghost out / in thyn beginning and in
thyn ending of every deed / always look that thou ne none of thine forfette
against gods law because of the. Deu^.vi. And in an other place of the same
book he says thus. Thou shall teache my words to thy childern / to thy folk
/ and to thy kynne s;men. Deut^.iiij. And saint Austyn says. That each man in
his own household should do the office of the bishop in techynge and
correctynge of common things. And therefore says the law. That the office of
techynge and chastysynge longs not only to the bishop / but to every
gouerno^^e after his manner and his degree. To the poor man gouernynge his
poor household. To the rich man gouernynge his folk. To y^ housbon de man
gouernyng his wife. To the fader and mother gouernynge there childern. To the
Justice gouernynge his contree. To the king gouernynge his people.xiij
q^.iiij. duo. et q^ v. no^ putes And one neighbor should teache an other. For
saint Peter says. Every man mynyster on to other the grace that he has taken
of god prio petri. ij. Dives. My fader and mother be deed / and therefore I let
me dyscharged of this commandment. Pauper. Though they be deed / ^et art
thou bound to do them worship and to help their souls with holy prayers and
alms deeds if thou myghtest. Also thou art bound to worship them with thy
good living as I said first. For the wise man says. That he that techeth well
his child / he shall be praised and worshypped in his child among his
kynrede / he shall have Joy and worship in his child. The fader of the well
taught child in some manner is deed / and in some manner is not deed. For he
left his child like after him / for all if the fader dye bodily / yet he
lived and is worshypped in the goodness of his childern. Est mortuus et quasi
no^ est mortuus. Eccl.xxx. And in the wicked living of the child the fader is
vnworshypped and deed while he goth upon earth. Also by this commandment we
be bound to worship godfader and godmoder.

Caplm.xij.
ALso to worshypp god that is fader of all thing / that is called fader of
mercyes / and god of all conforte. Pater misericordiarum et deus tocius
consolacionis. He is our fader / for he made us of naught / he bought us with
his blood he fyndeth us all that us needs and much more / he saves us / he
keeps us / he ledeth us / he fedeth us / he medeth us. He is our fader by
grace / for by his grace he has made us eyres of heuens blyss^ / was there
never fader so tender over his child / as god is tender over us. He is to us
both fader and mother. And therefore we be bound to love him and to worship him
above all thing / as I said in the first commandment. But he may say to us
as that he said to the unkind Jews. Filius honorat patrem et seruus dominu^
suum timebit etc^. The sone says he by way of kind worshyppeth his fader /
and the servant shall dread his lord. Sythen than I am fader of all / where
is my worship. And sythen I am lord of all / where is my dread. Neither ye
worship me as a fader / ne dread me as a lord. Malach.i. Nunquid no^ est
pater vnus omniu^ vestru^. Nun quid no^ deus vnius creauit vos. Have ye not
says he al one fader / and one god made you all / why than says he despise ye
each man other. That is his brother by pride and ouerledynge and brekynde the
commandment of your form faders. Malach.ij. Also for tender love that he has
to mankind / he calls him self our mother saying to sinful souls. Wenest
thou says he yt the mother may forgete her young child yt she bare of her
body / and have no compassyon ne pity thereon / and though she forgete her
child and have no pity thereon / yet I shall not forgete the to show the
mercy. Ysaye.xlix. And therefore he says. Ego matter pulcre dilectioi^s and^. I
am mother of fair love / of love dread / of knowing of holy hope. In me is all
manner grace of truth and of life. In me is all hope of life / of virtue / of
mercy / and of al manner goodness. Eccl.xxiiij. And thus by this commandment we
be bound to love our god and worship him above all thing as our pryncypall
fader and mother. And that pryncypaly for the mercy and pity that he shows to
mankind in his governance and keeping By the first co^mau dement we be bound
to worship him above al thing / for he is endless might as god and begynner and
shaper of all thing.

Caplm.xiij
ALso we be bound by this commandment to worship our ghoostly fader that
has cure of our soul / as pope / and our bishop our prelate / our person /
our vycary / our curate / our confessor. And our mother that us must
worship is holy church. Of this manner fader and mother says Solomon. Audi
fili mi disciplina patris tui. et ne dim^ttas legem matris tue. My dear sone
says he / here the lore of thy ghoostly fader and forsake not the law of thy
mother holy church. Prouer.i. Of these manner faders speaks also holy wryt
Lord says he / here before thou made chosen faders / and made them full
holy.ij. Macha.i. Prelates of holy church be called faders. For their office
is to gendre folk in right believe and to nourysshe them in good thewes and
virtuous living. And therefore saint Poule says. Per eua^geliu^ ego vos genui.
By this gospel I begat you in christ. Such fads be worthy double worship /
as saint Poule says. For they be worthy to be reverenced of their subgettys /
and to have their living. Therefore they owe to have tithes and offerynges of
their childern that be under cure. For as saint Poule says in the same place.
The work man that well traueyleth is worthy his mede.i. Tymo.v. ca. But now
god may say. Regnaueru^t sed no^ ex me. Prelates have reigned in holy church /
and not of me ne by my pleasaunce. I made them not. I chase them not. And
therefore saint Poule says / that thou men have ten thousand masters / yet
they have but few faders. For prelates for the most part seek more there own
profyt tha^ profit of man's soul. Oe^s que sua sunt queru^t. no^ que Ihesu
xp^i. Such prelates and curates be not faders of the people / but wolves of
raven that devour gods people. Sicut escam panis. Of such prelates and
curates speaks Ysaye the prophet. Ipsi pastores ignorauerunt intelligencia^
and^. Such shepeherdes / prelates / and curates know not gods law / nete
under s;tandyng of gods law. Al they bowed a way from gods way in to
there own way of falls conscience from the highest to y^ lowest. Ysa lvi. And
for that said he / that the shepeherdes / prelates / and curates of holy
church did so folyshly. and will not seek up our lord god to please him and
to serve him. Therefore they have lost understanding and wit to teache the
people. And so al their flock is dyspercled by heresy debate dyuysy on and
dyscencyon Iere^.x. Who says god bytoke the sheepherdes and prelates that thus
dyspercled and al to rent the flock of my pasture or lesewe that is christian
people. Iere^.xxiij. And therefore saint Gregory in his Omely. omelia xvij. Ve
signauit dn^s. Makes his moan and says thus. Pray ye to god that he will
send true work men in to his corn / that is to say / among his people. For
there is much corn and much people to be taught / but few work men of
prechours for to teache them and to tylle man's soul / for though there be
folk to here / there be few to say or to teache. We see well says he y^ the
world is full of prestes But full little any of them werketh in gods corn.
For we take says he the office of preesthode / but we fulfill not to do the
work of the office.

Caplm.xiiij.
ALso by this commandment we be bound to worship our eldre y^ be our faders
in age. And therefore god says. Coram cano capite consurge and^. Rise up says
he by fore the white hered man / and worship ye the person of old man or
woman / and dread thy lord god. That is to say / for dread of god worshypp
thou thyn elders / and despise them not for no age or for no feblenesse.
Leuitici.xix. And therefore saint Poule badde the bishop Thymothee that he
should not vnderneme his eldre ne old folk to sharply neither to proudely /
but pray them as fader to amend them / young men as brethern / old women as
moders / young wymen as systres in all manner chastyte.i. ad Thimo.iiij. Dives.
Often time old folk be more shrewes than other and be full hard to amend
they be so roted in sin. And therefore as me thinks them needs to be hard
vndernomen and sharply. For god says that y^ child of an hundred year shall
deye / and the sinner of an hundred year shall be cursed Ysaye.xlv. Pauper.
Some old folk be virtuous and not customable to sin / such ought to be
worshypped / and if they do somty me amys / for that that they be not
customable to sin / therefore their prelates should the more spare them and
more worshypfully speak to them. Some old folk be customable for to sin
and will not amend them / and such be worthy no worship / as god showed full
well by the words of Ysaye And therefore saint Gregory says that the old man
full of sins should be hard vndernomen.

Caplm.xv.
Dives. Thyn answer is reasonable / say forth I pray the. Pauper. Also by
this commandment we be bounden for to worship our king / our lyege / our
soueraynes all. For all tho that have governance of us or of the comonte owe
by their office and their dygnyte to be faders of the comonte and of there
subgettes / and be besy to save there subgettes / as the fader his childern. And
therefore Naaman prince of Syrye was called fader of his servants.iiij
Regu^.v. And Job said. Pater eram pauperu^. I was fader of the poor and the
cause that I knew not I traced it and sought it up besely Job.xxix. And
therefore saint Poule byddeth the people to do worship and obey to their
soueraynes. And he says thus Serui obedite dn^is vestris carnalibus. Ye
servants obey ye to your flesshely lords with dread and tremelynge in
symplenesse of your heart / as to Christ Serve ye them not only at the eye to
please them / but as Crystus servant / Do ye the will of god of heart with
good will serving them of our lord god / not as men. That is to say / Serve
ye them truly for the dread of god and for the love of god. And think ye that
the service that ye do to them / ye do it to god. And he pryncypally shall
yield you your mede. For wot ye well says he that every good deed that man or
woman does / be he free or bound / he shall take his mede therefore of our
lord god. And ye lords and soueraynes says he / do ye the same to your
servants / and forgive them your thretenynges and think ye and wot ye it
well that god in heaven is god both of you and of your servants / and so ye
and they have both one lord one god yt accept no man for his person / but
yield each man and woman after that he deserves. Ad Ephe.vi. Dives. By these
words it seems that servants for their true service shall have much mede.
Pauper. That is soth. For he that does gods bidding god shall yield him his
mede. And it is gods bidding and gods will yt they serve truly and mekely
their soueraynes. And therefore says the gloss / that sythen Christ byddeth the
servants serve truly / if they serve truly / they serve not only man or woman
/ but pryncypaly serve Christ. Dives. Why byddeth the apostle that the
servants should obey and serve to flesshely and carnale lords Pauper. For
the gloss says. They must by gods law obey not only to good lords / but
also to shrewes. Therefore saint Peter says. Subiecti estote oim humane
creature propter dn^i and^. Be ye subgettes says he to every man and woman
that is your sovereign / not for themself / but for god. Be ye subgettes to
kings to dukes and to temporal lords and think ye that god has ordained
them to vengeance of wicked doers and to praysynge of good folk. For thus is
the will of god that with your good deeds and your meke service ye stop and
make still the uncunning of the unwise folk. Serve ye as free men / that is
to say / not only for dread of man / but for dread and love of god as for
gods servants. Dread ye god / and worship ye your king. And ye servants /
be ye subgettes and meke in all dread to your lords / that is to say / not
only in seruyle dread / but also in love dread for gods sake. Be ye subgettes
for gods sake / not only to good lords and well ruled / but also to shrewes
and tyrauntes. Non tantu^ bonis et modestis. sed ecia^ discolis. For than is
man and woman worthy thank of god / when as they for conscience and gods
sake suffers pacyently disease without gylte If ye be beten and buffeted for
your sins and your trespasses / ye be worthy no thank neither of god ne of
man. But if ye do well / and with that suffer pacyently disease unguilty than
be ye worthy much mede of god. And for to do thus Christ gave you ensample
when he suffered pacyently bitter death without gylte that ye should follow his
steps and pacyently suffer woo without any gylte These be the words of saint
Peter in his first pystle. ij. c.0 Here to accords saint Poule in his pystle
/ ad Romanos.xiij.ca0 where he says thus. Every soul / yt is to say / every
man and woman must be subgette and meke to the power above them and to his
soueraynes. For their is no power ne lordshypp but of god and of gods
ordenaunce. And therefore says he / who so withstondeth the lordshyp and the
power of his soueraynes / he withstandeth gods ordenau^ce / and geteth him
dampnaco^n without end. For why says he / princes and lords ben ordained of
god to dread of wicked works / not to dread of good works / will thou not
dread the power of thy soueraynes / do well and you shalt have praysynge of
him. For if he be a good lord / he shall love the the better / and if he be a
shrewe thou shall have the more praysyng of god that thou do well under a
wicked sovereign as the gloss says. Thy lord or thy king is gods mynystre
ordained of god to thy good. If you do amys dread you him / for he bears not y^
sword without cause / for he is gods mynystre / to venge the wrath of god in
him yt does amys. And therefore says he / be ye subgettes and meke to your
soueraynes as to the needful ordenau^ce of god / not only for to flee wrath of
your souerayns / but also for conscience. And therefore ye give trybutes to your
princes and lords / for they be gods mynystres and serve therefore in
defending and governance of the people. And as the gloss says / in that ye
give them trybute ye serve god / for they be gods mynystres.

Dives. When saint Poule said tho words. Emperors kings and nyghe all
princes and temporal lords upon earth were hethen folk and of false believe /
how might they be gods mynystres or gods servants. Pauper. Every creature
is servant and subget to god / or with his will / or without his will. And
therefore saint Austyn upon that psalm. Exaudi deus oro^em mea^ / and says
thus. Wene ye not that god suffers wicked folk to be in this world without
cause. For every wicked man says he / either god suffers hy^ to live for to
amend him / or else that good men may be amended by him and win mede by him
in that that they suffer his malice pacyently and trauayll for to amend him.
The malice of shrewes is a purgatory to good folk / and shrewes ben gods
scourge to chastyse gods childern which he had ordained to the kingdom of
heaven / and to punysshe and purge the sins of them that god loves / and
also to punysshe other shrewes. And therefore god said to the sinful Jews. For
ye will not here my words ne keep my laws. Therefore I shall send after my
servant Nabu godonosor king of Babylon / and bring him and all his people
upon this land and destroy this land because of sin. Ieremye.xxv. This
Nabugo donosor king of Babylon was an hethen man a great shrewe / and had no
love to god ne knew him not for his god. He was a wicked tyrau^t and destroyed
gods law and gods people and gods temple in Jerusalem And yet god called
him his servant for he was gods yerge to chastyse shrewes and to punysshe
the sins of gods people. And as ye see that when as the fader has beten
his child with a yerde / he casts the yerde in to the fire. Right so when
god has chastysed and scourged his childeren by wicked men and by wicked
tyrau^tes that been gods yerde / but if the tyrau^tes amend them / he shall
cast them in to the fire of hell with out end. And therefore he says. Ve
assure virga furoris mei et baculus ipse est and^. Woo be to the people of assure
and to his king / for they be the yerde and the staff of my wrath. I shall
send them against the false people / and against the people to which I am
wroth. I shall bydde him destroy the people / rob them / and slay them. But
he weneth not so / but he thinks al of his own might and malice / and I
bydde him do my rightfulnesse. Ysaye.x.

Caplm.xvij.
Dives. Sythen it is so that all lordshyp and power in earth comes of god / me
meruayleth much why god gives wicked men such great power in this world
Pauper. The power comes all of god / but the malice and wickedness and wicked
couetyse comes of man Dives. God knows their malice and what they will do /
why gives he than such lordshyp and power to shrewes. Pauper. For common sin
of the people. For sinful people rebel and false be not worthy to have a good
lord mercyable and benygne / but for to have cruel lords / false tyrau^tes
like the people. And therefore Job says. Regnare facit ypocryta^ Ppter peccata
populi. God makes an ypocryte a wicked liver to reygne for sin of the
people. Job.xxiiij. And therefore says holy write / that god gaaf his people a
king in his wrath such as should dysese them. Ozee.xiij. Dabo eis regem in
furore meo. Dives The phylosophre says.iiij. ethi. that the wicked man is
worthy no worship / and only the good man is worthy worshypp. For as he says
there / worship is mede of virtue. And so he that is not virtuous and vycyous
as tyrau^tes be is worthy no worship. Pauper. That is soth. Dives. Why byddeth
than god and Peter and Poule as you have said y^ men should do worship and obey
not only to the good lords / but also to the wicked. Pauper. As I said first.
We should obey and do worship to them / not for themself / but for god and for
power that god has given them. And for y^ they represent gods person in
earth we should worship them / not their own persons / but for y^ dygnyte y^
god has given them and made them our souerayus. And if they be good and
virtuous / we should do them worship and obey to them / not only for her
dygnyte / but for there virtue and our own profit. And therefore saint Poule
says. Obedite perpositis vestris and^. ad Hebre.xiij. Obey ye to your
prelates and souerayns / and be ye meke and subget to them. For why says he /
they be full besye and trauayl to save your souls / as they y^ should give
answer for your souls at the dome. Dives. Many of them careful little for
man's soul. They care more to get money and man's good / and many of them
be full feeble lyuers Pauper. When they be such take none ensample of there
wicked living / do not as they do / but as they say when they teache well /
and reverence them for their dygnyte and for there order / for so byddeth
christ in the gospel. Dives. I suppose that they ueyther do well ne teache well
/ for many of them be full lewed. Pauper Yet as long as they be thy souerayns
or thy curates thou shall obey to them in all th^nge reasonable and ^efull y^
longs to her office / and do them worship for there dygnyte / not for there
person / but for god* whose person they present in masses lyngynge in
shryftes herynge and in other sacraments geuynge and in gouernynge.

Caplm.xviij.
Dives. I suppose that my liege lord the king bydde me do a thing / and my
master or my souerayn bydde me do the contrary / or if my curate bydde me do
a thing contrary to my bysshoppes bidding to whom shall I obey. Pauper. In
that cas y^ shall obey to thy king that is thy sovereign and thy masters
souerayn also / and y^ shall obey to thy bishop that is thy curates prelate
and thyn also. If the kings bidding and the bysshoppes be not against gods
worshypp. And if thy king / thy pope / or thy bishop / or any other souerayn
bydde the do any thing that y^ know well that it is against gods worshypp
and against his law / thou shall not obey to them in that / but to god y^ is
their souerayn and thyn also. And therefore says saint Peter to the Jews.
Obedire oportet magis deo (...) huibus. It behooves to obey to god more than
to men. If it be ryghtfull to here you rather than god / deem ye. And y^ law
says y^ if any souerayn bid his suget any thing y^ is contrary to god / the
suget shall not obey ne do any thing unrightful and dishonest / ne y^ should
harm the comonte for his bidding if he know well y^ the bidding de not
lefull.i. q^.iij. n^ semp. Dives. I suppose y^ the luget be in doubt whether
it be gods law or not Pauper. Than shall he obey to his souerayn and he is
eccused / but if it be in such thing that he is bound to know and to conne
As if he bid him any thing y^ is openly against gods commandment / or
against the faith / or against gods law or law of holy church y^ he is
bound to know / than shall he not obey in any wise to his byddyng. Dives Is
the suget bound to obey to his souerayn in all thing lefull. Pauper Seruage
and subgeccon came to among mankind for pride and other sin. But as a
great clerk says Seneca li.iij. de benefi^ijs. This seruage went not in to
all men ne in to all wymen. But the better part of man and woman that is the
soul is outaken from such seruage and only man's body and woman's is bound
to seruage of temporell lords and of there souerayn / and man's soul and
woman's is free so y^ he may have his thought his love / his will Inward as him
lyketh without leave of his sovereign. And thereby he offends not his souerayn
ne pleases / but only god that knows surely man's heart. But only in the
deeds of the body the suget is bound to obey his sovereign. Dives. In which
deeds. Pauper In such as longs to reule and governance and in such things
as he has made him suget in to his souerayn / in such the suget ought to
obey to his souerayn. As knight in arms is bound to obey his chefteyn and
his leder in things that long to arms. The bound man to his lord in doing
seruyle works in dutee of his bou^dage / the sone to his fader in thing that
longs to good norture and reule of his household / the wife to her husbonde
in thing y^ long to matrymonye and socyall living / not in works of vylayn
seruage. And if the wife obey more than she is bound to / and do more deeds
of lowenesse in pleasau^ce of her husbonde than she is bound to she is more to
praise and the more he ought to love her and have her in worship as his own
flesh. And if she do it for gods sake / god shall be her mede though her
husbonde be full unkind But in things yt long to the king of man's body /
man ne woman is not suget to his lord ne to his souerayn temporal / but only
to god. For all men in things that long to kind of body be even / as in
substance of the body in bringing forth of childern. And therefore y^
servant may wedde without leave of his lord / and the sone without leave of his
fader. And the servant may keep him chaste without leave of his lord and against
his bidding / and the sone against the bidding of his fader / and wedde against
his bidding and if it him like. Neuerthele s;se it is good that young folk in
such things follow the counseyll of fader and mother and of their friends /
but if their counsel be to let them from god. For this reason also husbonde
and wife as against vsyng^ of their body be even / and each of them has power
over others body.

Caplm.xix.
Dives. Is the people bound to obey to the pope / to their bishop / to their
curate in all things what they will bid them do Pauper. In all thing that
longs to keeping of faith and of gods law and fleing from vices / to
which things they bound them in there baptem / they be bound to obey. And
in all things of the which the governance longs to men of holy church by
common law grounded in gods law to govern the people not in other things
that long not to men of holy church / ne in there precept not grounded in
gods law. And in the same manner clerks be bound to obey to there prelates
in things that long to there office grounded in gods law / and relygyouse
to there prelat in things y^ long to keeping of relygyon Dives. I suppose y^
lordshyp or prelacy be occupied vnryghtfully by might and falsnesse / by
symonye gyle and treason / be there sugettes bound for to obey to them.
Pauper. If they obey to them in things leful it is medefull. Netheles some
clerks say y^ such caas men be not bound to obey / but for to flee
sclau^der and the more decease. Petrus in scrip.super.ij. sent.d. vt. and sm^.
confess. li.iij. ti.0xxxiij. q^.v. But for as much as god gives oftymes the
realms and the lordshyppes of this world / and prelacy also not by man's
law ne man's dome / but but by his own preuy dome / and he is souerayn might
/ lord of lords / and king of kings / therefore it is most sure to obey to
such lords and souerayns as long as god suffers them For god gives
lordshyp and prelacy in this world / both to good and wicked. And therefore as
we find in Danye lys prophecye. God made Nabugodonosor the wicked tyrant
king and lord of the gretest part of this world And after for his pride he
took his kingdom fro him / and made him in wytt like a best / that he wend to
have be a best half lion half ox / and so he went on all four and fed
him among bestes in the forest seven months / till he knew that god was
pryncypall lord of every kingdom / and that he gives kingdom lordshyp to
whom that he will. Daniel. iiij. And therefore god said to Sedechye that was
king of gods people and to other kings in the country beside. I made earth
man and be upon earth in my great might / and I have given the lorshyp to
him that me lyketh And I have given all these lands and kyngdoms here about to
Nabu godonosor my servant king of Babylon / and all nacyons shall serve him
and his sone and his sons sone / and what nacyon or kingdom will not serve
him ne obey him. I shall destroy y^ nation by sword hongre and moreyn / and
who so will serve him and obey to hy^ I shall late hy^ dwell still in his
own land / and therefore serve ye him mekely and obey ye to him / and ye
shall live and fare well. Jeremy.xxvij. And christ in the gospel says. Reddite
q^ su^t cesaris cesa^i et q^ su^t dei deo. Yield ye to the emperor of Rome yt
is the emperors / and yield ye to god yt is gods And yet the emperor of
Rome had no right to the lordshyp yt he occupied but only by the gift of god
and by sword. Dives. I suppose yt the bishop bid a priest curs a man / which
man the priest holds unguilty and the multitude of the people also. Pauper
Either the bishop byddeth the priest denou^ce him acursed or he byddeth him
acurse him. If he bid the priest denou^ce him acursed in the bysshppes name /
if he may not well put it of. But he shall by way of charity excuse that man
in as much as he knows him unguilty. And also excuse the bysshopp / saying
that he is mys informed / and if he had known y^ treuth he would not have
cursed him And he shall counsel that man to suffer it lowely for help of his
soul / and he shall inform the bishop as soon as he may of that man's
vngyltynesse. But if the bishop bid y^ priest acurse him / the priest must
take heed whether his vngyltyed is openly known or is in doubt / or it is
certain but not openly known. If his vngyltyed be openly known / the pressed
shall allegge to the bishop that he is unguilty and prove it by witness. And if
he fail in his prove he shall obey to the bysshoppes bidding though he know
that the man is unguilty. And if he may preue him unguilty / he shall not curse
him / though y^ bishop bid him never so fersely. If it be in doubt whether he
is gylty or nay / than the priest shall obey to the bysshppes bidding. Sm^

Dives. When the officers of the king know well that a man or woman is dampened
to the death unguilty / shall they obey to the Judge that bid them slay man or
woman without gylte. Pauper If the offycer be seker y^ he is unguilty / he shall
not slay him / but he shall obey to god y^ byddeth him slay no man ne woman
unguilty. But if he be in doubt whether he is gylty or unguilty / than he shall
obey to the Judge and do his bidding / and he is excused by his obedyence.
Ray. li.ti.ix.de iurame^ to et proiurio.C.xiiij. ^d de iudice. Netheles the
sugettes must beware in such doubts / yt they presume not to much of there
own wit. For full often a man weneth to know a thing and be in certain of his
knowing / and yet he is desceyued and it is not as he weneth. And it is full
peryllous to y^ suget to repugne the dome of his souerayn / and to repreue y^
wit and ye sentence of many wise men / and therefore I cou^seyl the sugettes and
y^ officers in such to stand to y^ conscience and the ordenau^ce of there
souerayns / and obey with sorrow of heart having pity of man's death and of his
disease and no lykyng in cruelte. And therefore god bad in holy write yt men
should follow the sentence of there Iuges and do there bidding / and who so
would not obey them he should be slain. Deuteronomy.^xvi. The kings Justice
represent the kings person in full high degree. And therefore men must be more
adred to withstand his sentence and his dome / for his dome is called gods
dome. And as Solomon says. Sicut diuisiones aquarx. ita cor eius in manu dn^i
and^. As the watres says he may lightly be departed and drawn in diverse
parts / so is the heart of the king and of Iuges and rulers in the hand of
our lord. He shall enclyne it whether he will. For the dome that seems
vnryghtful to man's wit / is ryghtful in gods sight. And though the dome be
ryghtfull in gods sight / and though the man be worthy to dye / if the Judge
wene yt it be unrightful and he gives y^ sentence wenynge sekerly that it be
unrightful he synneth dedely though his sentence be ryghtfull For as saint
Poule says. All yt is not done of faith and of good conscience it is sin. If
the man be gylty / the law and his misdeeds sle him. If he be unguilty slain
by false dome of the Judge or by a false queste or by them that mys informed the
queste they slay him and not the officers / but if he do it wetyngly against the
worship of god. When the falshede of the dome is openly known / or if he do it
with liking in cruelte. Dives. Is the relygyouse man or woman bound to obey
his prelate when he byddeth hy^ do any thing against his rule. Pauper In all
thing that longs to very obseruau^ce of his rule / or is needful to good
and true keeping of the rule / he is bound to obey but he have reasonable
excusacyon. In other things that be Impertynent to the rule and to his
protessyon or contrary to the rule / he is not bound to obey. For if he were
bound to all such byddynges his year of nouycere should serve of naught. For
his prelate might so agregge the hardenes of living in relygyon in double
more than he made his professyon to / and bind him to more penance without
comparyson than ever he thought to bind him to / and put him in an other manner
living than he made never his professyon to / ne know in the year of his
assaye in his nouycere. And by the law every vow is set in some certain
But if the relygyouse were bound to obey in all thing / his professyon were
all uncertain and unassayed in his nouycerye. Netheles it is a great
perfe^^yon to obey in all things lefull after that man or woman may do
saving their rule and gods worship. And if his prelate bydde him do any
thing against his rule / he must take heed whether his prelate may dyspense
with that point of rule or nay. If he know well that he may dyspense with
that / he ought to obey his bidding. But if he know well yt he may not
dyspense with y^ point of the rule / he shall not obey to him in yt / and he
shall also obey if he be in doubt whether he may dyspense or not. Dives. Tell
me some ensample Pauper. In fasting / in waking / in silence keeping / and in
diverse obsernau ce of relygyon y^ prelate may dyspense / and in caas he ought
to dyspense against his sugett^ will when he sees y^ his suget may not keep
such points of his rule without undoing of him self / or without hindering
of other things that be more to gods worship. And oftymes the sugettes will
do more than they may do / and put them to more than the may perform. And
than there prelate as a good fader ought to take heed thereto and for salvation
of his suget dyspense with him and put hy^ in dyscrete gouernau ce for
saluaco^n of the person / and for the worship of god. And the suget ought to
obey his byddyng and stand to his ordinance with good conscience. In some
things the prelate may not dyspense / as in the pryncypall points of every
relygyon / that is to live in obedyence / in pouerte and in chastyte And many
other things ben exempt by laws of relygyon in which the prelate may not
dyspense. And therefore if the prelate bydde the suget do any thing that is
against the three pryncypall points of his rule / or against such things in
which he may not dyspense / his suget ought not to obey his bidding.

Dives. If the bishop bid a clerk give his book to his nece or neuewe or
resygne his church and his benefyce yt the bishop may give it to his nece or
neuewe / or to some of his kynne / is y^ clerk bound to obey yt bidding of
the bishop Pauper. Nay forsooth For it longs not to the bishop to bid such
things. Netheles if the clerk have good books and is unable to profit in
book / and the bishop bid him leave the book to an other clerk that is able to
profit in the book and to help holy church he is bound to obey. If he gate
tho books of holy church goods / or by cause of holy church / as if it were
given or byquethed him to profyt of holy church. But if the books be purely
his own / he is not bound to obey that bidding. Dives What if the husbonde
bid his wife break auowe that she has made to god / as of fasting / of
pylgremage / co^tynence / wol ward going / and such other / is she bound to
obey his byddyng. Pauper Ye forsooth. And but she obeys his bidding in that
else she synneth / and if she do his bidding only for obedyence she wynneth
much mede / for in yt she obeys to god which byddeth her obey to her
husbonde / and so in y^ she does the will of god / though y^ she be sorry that
she may not perform her vow.xxxiij.q^.v. noluit. More over leave friend ye
shall understand yt as saint Bernarde says in Epl'a ademonacho Some things
be purely good of themself / and to such we be bound by gods law / as ten
commandment. Some be full wicked of the^self / and tho we be bound to flee by
gods law without any bidding of any sovereign under god. And therefore in
such things stands not proprely the virtue ne mede of obedyence to man or
woman. Other things there be that may be good and they may be wicked / and well
do and evil do / and in such things stands proprely obedyence that men
ought to there souerayns. For in such we should stand to there will and to there
wit more than to our own. For in such stands proprely the virtue of
obedyence that we owe to man for gods sake. And the harder yt the
commandment be if it stand with reason, the more medefull is the obedyence.
For the more y^ man or woman forsakes his own will for gods sake yemore is
his lowene s;se / and the more is his mede.

ALso leave friend by this commandment we be bound to worship all yt be in
higher astate and dygnyte than we be. For all such be called our faders in
worship Patres honor. And therefore in holy wryt all men of worship be called
senes et seniores / yt is senyours in frenshe. And in frenshe tongue men of
worship and lords be called senyours and perys / yt is faders in english.
For they be fads in worship and ought to be worshypped as fads by this
commandment For commonly in men of worship is and ought to be sadness of
wit and wisdom as in men of age / for in them is the age of wit and wisdom
/ though they have no great age of years. And therefore says Solomon. Senectus
venerabilis est non diuturna neque an norum numero computata. The age of
worship stands not in long living ne in nombre of years / but it stands
in wit and wisdom. For the wits of the wise man ben old and sad / and a
clean life is called age of eloc. Sapie.iiij. And therefore god byddeth in the
old law. Honora personam senis et time dn^m deu^ tuum. Leuitici.xix. Worship
thou the person of an old man and dread thy lord god. And in the new law
he says thus. Deum timete regem honorificate. Dread ye god and worship ye
your king.i. petri.ij. That is to say For dread of god worship thou thyn elder
/ and for dread of god worship thou thy king and thy sovereign and all that be
in higher degree than thou art. For sythen god has put them in degree of worship
/ thou must for dread of god worship them. And but thou worship them / else
thou offendest god. Omnes honorate. Worship ye all men and women after there
astate and there dygnyte. And saint Poule byddeth that all thing should be do
honestly and in order. Oi^a honest et scdm ordine^ fiant.i. ad little.xiiij.

ALso leave friend by this commandment we be bound to worship holy angels and
saints in heaven / for they be our faders in age in worship in cure and in
keeping of us. For they longen after us yt there nombre and there company that
was lested by the pride of lucyfer might be restored again by saluaco^n of us.
And therefore night and day they prayen for us to god for help and grace
needful to us. Of these faders speaks saint Poule in his pystle and says
thus. I knele and pray for you night and day the fader of our lord Ihesu
christ of whom is named all manner of faderhede in heaven and in earth. Ex quo
omnis paternitas nominat in celo et in terra. ad Ephe.iij. For as the gloss
says there dysposycyon the angellys be our faders in heaven ordained for us /
and in earth prelates be our faders having cure and keeping of us. And so
both prelates in earth and angellys in heaven ben our faders And therefore as
all these clerks sayen. Each man and woman has two angels assygned to him one
of god an other of the fend. For the fond Sathanas at gods suffraunce
assygneth to him a wicked angel to tempte him and to lose him. But god of his
goodness assygneth him a good angel to save him and to keep him. Of which good
angel christ says in the gospel / that they see always the face of the fader
in heaven for they be always in his presence and speak for us and pray for us.
And therefore says saint Ierom upon the same word of christ / that angels bear
our prayers and our good deeds in to heaven / and keep and defend us against the
malice and the sleyght of the fend. And therefore the angel Raphaell / when he
had led the sone of Tobye in to fer contree and saved hy^ from many perils
and brought him again in great wealth / he said to Tobye / when thou praydest
with bitter teres and beryedeste the deed bodies and leftest thy mete and
had deed bodies by day in thyn house and beryeste them by night for gods
sake against the will of the wicked king Senacheryb. Than offered I thy prayer
to our lord god. Thobie.iiij. Also we read in the fourth book of kings
the.vi. chaptre. That the prophet Helyzee was suddenly by night besyeged in
the Cite of Dothaym with the oost of the king of Syrye In the morrow the
servant of Helyzee saw the oost about the Cite and he was full sorry and said
to his master Helyzee. Alas alas alas what shall we do / we be so besyeged with
our enemies yt we may not escape. Than Helyzee said to him. Dread ye not / for
we have more folk with us than they have with them. Than Helyzee prayed to god
that he would open the eyes of that servant / that he might see what help
Helyzee had with him And anon he saw the hills about Helyzee full of horse
and charettes brennynge as fire and a great people arayde to battle / that was
the oost of angellys sent of god for keeping of Helyzee / through whose help
the prophet Helyzee led all the oost that had besyeged him in to the Cite of
Samarye among all there enemies / for they were so blent that they wist not
whether they went. They come to take Helyzee / and Helyzee took them with
help of angels and did with them what he would. And therefore Dauyd says.
Montes in circuitu eius et dn^s in circuitu ppli sui. The hills / that is to
say / the angellys be about the good man and the good woman to keep them / and
god is about his people to save them. And therefore saint Cecyle said to her
husbonde Valaryan I have gods angel that loves me full well / and keeps my
body with great suerte that no man shall defoule me. And if thou will by
foul love defoule me / he shall ^lee the. And if thou love me with clean love
and will keep my maydenhode hole and clean / he shall love the as well as me.
And when thou art crystened thou shall see him. Anon her husbonde Valeryan by
her counsel went and was crystened of the bishop saint Urban And when he was
crystened / he came again and found saint Cecyle prayenge in closet / and the
angel standing besides her with wings and feathers full bright / and his face
shone and glymered as the fla^me of fire. He had in either hand a garlonde
made of roses and lelyes full fair and tresshe and full sweet in smelling. He
gaaf unto saint Cecyle one an other to Valeryan and bad them keep them in
clennes both of body and of soul. For why said he I have brought the^ out of
paradyse And ye shall know by this token / for they shall always be grene and
fresshe / and neither welke ne fade / ne lose there sweet savor / and no man ne
woman may see them / but they that love clenne s;se and chastyte as ye do. We
read also in the life of saint Agnes that when she was but.xiij. year of age /
suffered death for the love of god / and for the love of chastyte / for she
would not assent to be wedded to the great lords sone of Rome / for he was
hethen. And also for she would keep her mayndenhode to christ. She was made
naked and led to the bordell house to be defouled of sinful wretches. But
suddenly her here wexe so much that it hylled and hid all her body. And
when she came to the bordell house her good angel was ready and brought her a
clothe as white as snow full mete to her body / and be lapped her with so
great light yt there might no man look upon her / ne no man durst enter the
place. Thanne the lords sone as full hardy ran in to that light for to defoule
her. And anon the fend whom he would have served / slough him. But saint
Agnes with her prayer to god and help of her good angel raised him from death
to life / to shame and shenshyp of all hethen people. For anon he went out of
that house and cried openly that there was no god but christ / and desspysed
her mawmettes and there false believe. Also when saint Agace was buried / her
angel in the likeness of a young man clothed in clothe of sylke with an
hundred young men al clothed in white / that were angels also / or else holy
souls came to the beryenge and laid a stone of marble upon her grave with a
writing of great confort to all y^ contre / and went not thens till all the
buryenge was do / and never after was see any of all that company Also the good
angel brake the wheles that should have slain saint Katheryne. And when she
was deed for gods sake y^ angels took her body and bare it in the earth in
to y^ mou^te of Synay and there buried it worship fully. And therefore leave friend
I pray you y^ ye have saints in heaven and holy angels in reverence and
devotion / for they be to us fader and mother as I said first. Worship ye our
lady mother and maid above all next after god / and than other saints both
man and woman and holy angels as god gives you grace / worship ye them / not
as god / but as our tutours defendours and kepers and our leders and governors
under god and means between god and us that is fader of all and sovereign Judge
to queme him and to pray for us to get us grace to do well and forgyuenes of
our mysdede. And therefore Dauyd says. Pro hac.id est promissione peccati
orabit ad te oe^s scu^s in tempere oportuno Every saint shall pray to the
lord in behofull time for mercy and forgyuenesse of sin. And leave friend
pray ye hertely to your angel as to him y^ is next you and has most cure of
you and is most besy to save you under god. And if ye will follow his
governance and trust in hy^ in all goodness / and with reverence and clennes
pray ye hy^ faithfully / plain you to hy^ and speak ye to him homely to be
your help as he is your tutour and keeper assygned of god and say ye often that
holy prayer. Angele qui meus es and^.

Dives. Thy speech pleases me well and thy words be good and devout / but I
parye the say forth of this commandment if thou can more. Pauper. Also by
this commandment men of holy church be bound to worship there patrones. For
the patron of the church is fader of the church and of the benefyce in that
that he begins it of naught xvi.q^.vij.pia in glosa. Dives. For which
things is a man called patron. Pauper. For three things For foundacyon that is
gyuynge of ground / for the first dotacyon / and for making of the first
church. Patronum faciunt dos edificacio fundus. Dives What worship ought men
of holy church to do to there patrons / and what right longs to the patron.
Pauper. It longs to him for to present a person able and give the church
and the benefyce by way of alms to whom he thinks able by assent of the
bishop. Also it longs to him to mayntene the church and to keep it fro
dylapydacyon and from destruccyon and from all manner wrongs as a good fader
and a good tutour and as a true advocate to keep and defend the church and
the mynystres of the church from all wrongs and dyseases upon his power. And
if he find person vyker or curate or any other clerk or prelate mysusynge
the benefyce in which he is patron / he ought to amend them in fair manner if
he may. And if he may not he ought to tell the bishop thereof / or some of his
officers / to whom longs the correcco^n of such defautes. And if the bishop
do not his devour ne his offyceres he shall tell it to the archebysshop And but
he do his devour he shall tell it to king.xvi.q^.vij filijs. And therefore men
of holy church that be auau^c^d by there patrons must nedely do they. patrons
worship and have them in reverence by way or kyndenes / and for need of help
to be mayntened in there ^yght. And also for dread of th^r offense. For if they
mysbere them / there patrons may depryue them of there benefyce by assent of the
bishop / and in ^aas against the bysshoppes wyl^. Also it longs to men of
holy church to sustain there patrons and there childern when they fall to need
And if they be taken prisoners to help to pay there rau^some.xvi.q^.vij.
qcu^que.Ex.li.iij de iure patronatus canobis fuit. Et.x.ij. q^.i. aplicos and^.

there patrons worshypp / in lyttynge / in going / and put them before in
sitting in going.xvi q^ vij. p^a mentis. And it longs to the patron to have
the pryncypall place and sytte pryncypally in his church. Tabula iuris
dictione pat^onatus. And for worship of the patron and his ease the priest may
sing two masses in one day. Extra.li.iij. de celebraco^e missarum
consuluisti. And when the patron presents a person to the bishop / which
person he will auau^ce / the bishop is bound to resceyue that person / but
if he be proved and known for a wicked man and unable.xvi.q^.vij monasteriu^.
Also y^ patron may in his fou^dacyon before the halowynge of the church
reserve to him a certain rent by year by assente of the bishop to resceyue
it of y^ church. Ex de iure pat^. t. p^terea. Et hostiensis in su^. sua

he be confermed / and if he be unable / he may and ought to with stand the
confyrmacyon. Ec.de ^ure patronatus ca nobis fuit.et.xvi.q^.vij filus. Also he
may in his foudacyon of the church collegyat reserve to hy^ to be in the
eleccyon of the prelate of the church with assent of the bishop or of the
pope by the same law / but he must show that written when he will use it.
Hostiensis li.iij.Ru.de iure patronatus. Et tabula ^uris dictione patronatus.
Et extra de iure patronato nobis fuit in glosa. Dives Patrons find full often
there au^u^ces full unkind to them and full proud. And therefore many a patron
may say. Filios exaltaui et enutriui.ipsi autem spreuerunt me. Ysaye primo. I
have auau^ced childern and brought them up of naught and they have despised me.
Pauper. Such unkind men of holy church but they amend them they shall have
gods curse / that he gaaf to all such in the same chaptre. Ve ge^ti
peccatrici pplo graui iniqtate semini nequod filijs sceleratis Woo be to the
sinful people heavy through wyckednes / to the wicked sede / to the unkind
sinful childern. Dives. If a church be destroyed / and a man do it make again
of his cost / shall that man be called patron of the church. Pauper. Ye
though he do make it again of the same matter that it was made of before. And
the patron that was before patron only by making of the church or gyuynge of
the ground leseth his right of the patronage. But if he were patron by
dotacyon he leseth not his right of patronage. In tabula iuris patronatus. If
the patron vary in his representaco^n presentynge first one and sythen an
other / it stands in y^ dome and will of the bishop to resceyue which he
will. Though the patron of layfe present a person unable / he leseth not his
right of rep^sentaco^n ne ought to lose it. But if a college present a person
unable / in y^ he leseth his right of presentaco^n for that time. And if a
clerk present a person unable he is worthy to lose his right of presentacyon
for that time. Extra de electione cu^ in cu^ctis. The patron of the layfe may
abide but four months of his presentaco^n. The college and the clerk patron
may abide six months / and if they pass there time by retchelesnesse or by
bryge / the bishop shall ordeyne for yt church and benefyce. No man ought to
present himself. The patron may lefull present his sone / his neuewe / and
any of his kynne / if they be able and power. And if a patron be poor and
nedy / the bishop may give him that benefyce in which he is patron / and he
may take it of his gift / so that yt gift come only of the bysshoppes free
will / without any procuring of himself. Hostien sis li.iij.de iure patronatus.

Dives. I thank the for thou haste told me more of this commandment than
ever I herd before But yet me meruayleth much why yt god byddeth not men do
almesdede to strangers and to other folk at need in none of all the ten
commandments. For but men be bound thereto by gods commandment. I hold
it no dedely sin to leave it. Ne men should not be dampened for they did it
not. Pauper. By this commandment p^yncypaly we be bound to help al nedy
tolke upon our power. For by this commandment we be bound to show pity to
all men. Dives. Co^tra / god speaks in this comau^dement only of worship yt
longs to fader and mother. Pauper. That worship stands in two things / in
affecco^n of heart thy^ king / and in deed doing. By affecco^n of heart we
should love all men and women with dread to offend them vnskylfully By deed
doing we should do al men reverence after there degree and help them in need as
we would be holp ourself. And therefore saint Peter byddeth us worship al men /
and saint Poul byddeth yt each man and woman do put other before in worship /
for each man ought to hold with others fad in some degree

Caplm.xxvi.
Dives. Why so. Pauper. For each man passes other in some degree of worship /
and in yt he is his fad / or in being / or in wisdom / or in goodness. In
being we have many faders. For some be fads of our first being as our bodily
faders and moders yt us begat. Some be faders in well being / and that in two
manners / for some ghoostly some bodily. In well being ghoostly / be our faders
prelates of holy church and al yt have cure of our souls. In well being
bodily be our faders all that have cure and governance of our body and of our
living in this world / as kings princes lords and such other. Also all
that be elder in age and had there being before us / be our faders. Faders in
wisdom be prechours techers men of law clerks and men of age which by long
experyence know more than their younger. Faders in goodness be all holy men /
and all yt pass us in goodness. And for that each man ought to deem other
better than himself / therefore each man ought to worship other as fader in
goodness / but if open malice make him like a be and no man. And therefore
saint Poule says. Superiores sibi inuice^ arbitrantes. Every man and woman
deem other his souerayn in goodness. Ad Philip^.ij. For as the gloss says
there. Though we seem sovereign to other by some goodness and dygnyte that is
in us openly known / yet there may be some goodness preuely in another of
lower degree / in which goodne s;se he is our sovereign in gods sight. Dives.
Why is this commandment given with a byhest of health and more welfare than
any of the other commandments. For he says thus / worship thy fader and
mother that thou may live long upon earth and fare well in the land that thy
lord god shall give the. Deuteronomy ^ vi. Pauper. For sith god behoteth so great
mede for keeping of this commandment that is most natural / and whereto man
and woman is most enclyned by way of kind / he shows well yt men should
have much mede for keeping of other co^mau^deme t yt be not so natural. And
by y^ mede assygned for keeping / god shows well what pain man and woman
shall have for ye brekyng / yt is to say short live upon earth and evil fare /
both here and in y^ land of death / and after lose yt land of life without end
and wend to y^ land of woe and of derkenes. Terra^ misery et tenebrarum. And
for yt this co^mau dement is pryncypall of y^ second table / and in manner
encludeth all six following / thorfore to this commandment he knytteth the
mede for the keeping of all / and pain for brekynge of all. For after he
behoteth many diverse medes to them yt keep his byhestes and many myscheues to
them yt break them. And all they be comprehended in this short byhest knyt to
this co^mau^deme t. For y^ byheste is most co^uenyent to this commandment.
For as saint Poule says / ruth pity and almesdede is good for all things and
has his mede both in this world and also in y^ other world yt is coming.
Dives. Show me that. Pauper. For it is good reason that they live long /
which mayntene well them that be beginning of there life / that is fader and
mother. For when the rote of the tree fails by defaute of the tree above /
than the tree shall soon fail and sere up. And it is not worthy that he live
long ne fare well that worshyppeth not them ne help them by whom he lives
and has his life and his welfare And he that worshyppeth not the beginning of
his being is worthy soon to lose his being. And he that helps other with
his good to live long good life / is worthy to have good and good life.

Caplm.xxvij.
ALso good friend ye shall understand that god says these words not only to
every person by himself / but he said them to all the people and to every
people as to one person / not only for worshyppynge of their flesshely fader
and mother / but also for worshyppynge of there souerayns in there degree as I said
before For why as long as any people is burum and meke to there souerayns / and
will follow her governance / and worship men after there degree / and every man
be paid with his own degree and do the dute of his degree / so long y^ people is
able to keep yt land yi god has given them to live good life. But when they
will rebelle against their souerayns and will not stand to their ordinance but
every man will be his own man and follow his own fantasyes / despise his
souerayns there dome and governance / ne give no tale of gods law ne of
lands law ne of holy church law / ne have men of dtue and of dygnyte in
worship / but for pride have them in despyte and be besy to worship themself in
hynderyng of other that people is able to the sword and able to lose his
land. For as ye see at the eye in time of tempest / though the bows of the
tree beat themself to gydre and all to breast and fall down as long as y^
rote of the tree keeps him fast in his place and ryseth not / so long y^ tree
shall not fall. But when y^ rote begin to rise out of his place / anon y^ tree
begin to fall. Right thus it fares by y^ people of a land. Though tempest of
pride / of couetyse / of envy of lechery fa^ sometime in y^ croppe of y^ tre^
yt is to say among lords and souerayns and great men / if y^ poor people yt
is rote of y^ tree and of all y^ comonte keep them still in lownes and do mekely
there dute to god keeping his commandment and y^ good preceptis of there
souerayns so long is hope yt the people shall fare well after yt tempest and
not be destroyed / but if they rise against god by customable dedly sins / and
against there worldely souerayns / and will entecmete them of every cause of yt
land and of holy church / and termine every cause by there wytt body and crop
of y^ tree shall fall. For it is not possible yt the rote should be so high as
the crop of the tree / but y^ tree fell. Ne yt the foot should be above y^ head /
but the body fell Dives. This is full soth / we see it at y^ eye for pride and
rebellyon of y^ poor people is cause of destrucco^n of this land. For sythen
they aresen against there souerayns was there never stabylyte in this lord / but
always sith y^ tree of y^ people of this lord and y^ realm has stand in
falling. Pauper. Vnbuxu^nesse and pride was pryncypal cause of lesynge of
lands and of realms And pryncypally the cause of salvation of realms lands
and comontees is obedyence and buxumnesse that each man in his degree obey to
his souerayn and worship him as fader. And therefore leave friend I pray you for
gods sake yt ye worship all your faders and moders in their degree / as I have
said. And have ye old folk and feeble in worship while ye be in young age and
worship ye the age that ye draw to and have no scorn of the old folk for
feebleness and uncleanness yt ye see them in. But think ye that such ye shall be
if ye abide their age / feeble vnourne and loath to the sight. For such as ye be
now such were they sometime. It fares by age of man and woman as it does by a
precious stone yt is called crysolitus. This stone as the master says of
kinds in the beginning of the day it shyneth bright as any gold / but as
the day passes so passes his bryghtnesse / and the nerer even the more it
fades / so y^ by even it is like a clot of earth. Thus fares by man and woman
in this world. For in their youth and in their beginning they be fair read
and rody and fresshe as a rose in May full lusty to the eye But as youth
passes so passes there beauty. And as they old / so they fade till at the
last the day of their life comes to an end / and than be they but a clot of
earth full vnourne and gastely to the sight.

Here ends the fourth commandment
And begins the fyfthe Capitulum Pr m si.
Dives. As me thinks / thou have informed me well in these tour
commandments. Now I pray the for charity that thou wylt inform me in y^
fyfth. Pauper The fyfth commandment is this Non occides. That is to say / you
shall not slay. In which commandment god forbedeth us all manner manslaught
unlawful both bedely and goostly. He byddeth us yt we slay no man ne woman
vnryghtfully against y^ law / neither with heart consentyng to his death / ne by
wrath and hate. For as saint John says. Qui odit fre^m suu^ homicidia e^ He yt
hates his brother is a man sleer for of wrath and hate comes ma^slaughter
Also by this commandment he forbydeth betyng / fyghtyng / and maynyng
prysonyng / banysshyng / outlawynge. For these and such other be a manner of
death and dyspose to death ward / and therefore it should not be do to man ne
woman without great gylt. Also he forbedeth y^ we sle no man ne woman with our
tongue / him hynderyng and procuring his death / ne favor gyuynge / ne false
witness berynge / ne lesynges making / ne by dyffamynge ne bacbytynge For
bacbyters and wicked spekers be manquellers. And therefore says Solomon That
much folk has fall by the sword / but not so many as have be slain by the
tongue. Eccl.xxviij And therefore he says. Prouer.xviij. That life and death be
in the hands of the tongue. That is to say in the might of the tongue. For by
hands in holy wryt is understand might and power. And therefore Dauyd says.
Lingua eorum gladius acutus. The tongue of y^ Jews and of other wicked spekers
is a sharp sword. For y^ Jews slow christ with there tongues not with there
hondes. For they procured his death by false witness / and by excytynge of the
people. But paynyms slow him with their hondes and did him on the cross. And
yet as saint Austen says. The Jews were more gylty of crystus death / than
Pylate that dampened him to the death / or the knights that did him on the
cross. For with her tongues the Jews slo^e him and were cause of his death. And
therefore says the law / that he that sleeth his brother with his hand / and
he that hates his brother / and he that bacbyteth his brother all th^e be
mansleers. Deep di.i. homicidiarum. The bacbyter sleeth three attones / he
sleeth him self by his own malice / and him that hereth him / and him that
has liking in his false tales / and him that he bacbyteth. For he makes him
to lose his good name / and peradventure his life. He makes him also to lose
charity / when he knows his wicked speech that he has said behind hy^ and
so bylesyng of charity he leseth god yt is his life of his soul And therefore
the wise man lykeneth the bacbyter to the adder that byteth and styngeth in
stylnesse. Eccl.x. A shrewed adder is the bacbyter that sleeth three with one
breath. Therefore Solomon says. Ktepe ye you from bacbytynge of y^ parted tongue.
For a wicked word said in preuy / shall not pass in vain and without woo. For
the money says he that lyet sleeth the soul. Sapie. i.

Caplm.ij.
Dives. Io flaterynge any goostly maslaughter Pauper In so much as it sleeth
the soul both of him that flatereth and of him that is flatered / in so much
it is goostly manslaughter. Dives Is every flaterynge goostly manslaughter and
dedely ^ynne. Pauper. Nay. For flate^ynge is ^^peche of vain pray ynge said
to man or woman with Intencyon to please them And that may b^^ do in three
manners / as praysynge man or woman in godenesse and in good that he has. Or
else pray ynge them in goodness and good that they have not Or else praysynge
them in threwydnesse and falsenesse / of which manner flaterynge speaks Dauyd
and says. Qm^ lauda^ peccatur in desiderijs ^ie sue and iniquus benedice^.
Forsothe says he the sinner is praised in desires of his soul and the wicked
man is blessed of folys For when threwes have forth their will in shrewdenesse
/ than the world prayseth them and worshyppeth them The first manner of
praysynge if it be do only to please man and not god it is sin and in case
dedely sin. And therefore saint Poule says / that if he would only please man
and not god / he were not christ servant But it be do to plese god and for a
good end it is comendable and medefull. For in good folk virtue that is
praised wexeth. Virtus lauda^ crescit. But this manner praysynge is no
flaterynge. The second manner of praysynge if it be do for god and for a good
end it is sufferable / and in cas^co^mendable and medefull. But if it be do
wetyngly / only to please man and not god / it is dedely sin. The third
manner of praysynge / if it be do willing and wetynge it is dedely sin. And
therefore Dauyd said. Oleu^ pcco^ris no^ ipinguet caput meu^. Lord god says he
/ let not the oil of the sinner make fat my he de / yt is to say / let my
heart never have no liking ne Joy in false flate^ynge. For as saint Austen
says / the tongue of y^ flaterer does more harm than yt sword of y^ enmye
pursuynge Therefore Solomon says it is better to be vndernomen of the wise man /
than be desceyued by flaterynge of foles Eccl.vij. This lynne of flateryng is
so great and grievous yt if any man of holy church were customable therein / he
should be degraded. Also if he were a traitor or a teller of shryfte. distinc.
xlvi. clericus. God gives curs to all false flaterers saying in this wise Ve
q^ consuu^t puluillos sub oim cubi to manus et faciu^t ceruicalia sub capite
universe etatis ad capiendu^ aias Who be to them yt so we small soft pelowes
under every elbowe / and make pelowes under the head of every age to take yt
souls of my people. They quyckened souls yt were not quycke / but deep in
dedely sin / and so defouled me before my people. For because of there
flaterynge they given no tale of me / ne dread me / ne worshypp me. For an
handful of barley says he and for a gobbet of bread they slough souls that
were not deed / and they quyckened souls that lived not / making lesynges to
my people that loved lesynges. And they conforted sinners in their sin and in
there falsenesse / and dysconforted good folk in their godenes and in their
t^outh. Eze.xiij.

Caplm.iij.
Dives. This vice of flaterynge regneth full much in this land. For the
people is so blent with flaterynge and lesynges / that they see not the
myscheef yt they be in. And therefore they live forth in pride and not low them
to god ne pray to god for help as they should do / if they knew there
myscheefuousnesse yt they be in. Pauper. Therefore god says. Popule meus q^ te
beatu^ dicu^t. ipsi te decipiu^t et viam gressuu^ tuorum dissipant. My people
they y^ see that thou art blessed and in wealth / they dysceyue the and destroy
the way of thy going / that thou might not forth / ne have no speed in thy
works for defaute of grace. Ysaye.iij. Dives. What is understand by the
pelowes that god speaks of against flaterers. Pauper. As saint Gregory says
Moraliu^.xviij. super illud Job.xvij. Donec deficiam no^ recedam and^. He that
prayseth man or woman in his wicked work / he lays his pelowe under his
elbowe. And he that gladdeth the heart of the sinner in his sin he lays a
pelowe under his head For by the head is understand y^ her For why by such
flaterynge they rest softely and sleep in their sin and deye ghoostly
without pain and perceive not her own death And therefore Solomon says. That he
that Iustefyeth the wicked man and dampened the ryghtful man / both they be
abhomynable to god. Prouer.xvij. Therefore god lykeneth flaterers to them that
playstren and paynten walls and wowes without. For thing that is foul they
make it to seem fair and make folk to have liking in her sins. Therefore
god says that the sinner makes the wall of sin between him and god. But
flaterers playsteren and paynten the wall of sin. Eze.xiij. Also flaterers
be lykened to an adder that is called dypsa which as the master of kinds
says* li. xviij. He is so little that though a man trede thereon he may not see
it. But his venym is so vyolent that it sleeth a man or he feel it / and he
deyeth without pain. Right so flaterynge seems but a small sin / and yet it
is full venomous and sleeth man's soul or he feel it / and without pain
brings him to endeles pain. Flaterers be lykened to an adder that is called
tyrus which is lest of all adders / and yet his venym is not curable as says
the master of kind in the same place Right so flaterynge seems but a full
little sin / and yet it is so venomous yt it will not lightly be heled. For
when a man or woman has liking in flaterynge and rules his life after
flaterynge tongue / it is full hard to that man or woman to be saved. For as
long as men pra^sen hy^ in his sin / so long he is ^olde in his sin. And
if men begin to lack him / he falls in to sorrow and dyspayre. Therefore
says saint James. That the tongue is but a little membre / and reyseth up great
disease it is a wicked thing that has no rest full of dedely venym. Iacobi.
iij. And the prophet Dauyd says. Acuerunt linguas suas sicut serpents.
venenu^ aspidum sub labijs eorum. They have sharped her tongues as addres / the
venym of addres is under the lyppes of flaterers and wicked spekers. And if a
man do his deeds only for to be prased and flatered of the people / flaterynge
is his mede. And when flaterynge cesseth and the wind tourneth against him / he
has no longer liking in good deeds. And so as the gospel says / for that
he seeks thank in praysynge only of man for his good deeds and not of god
Therefore all such be lykened to the five maidens foles that would mete with
their husbonde christ Ihesu at the dome with lamps without oil. That is to
say / with good deeds without ghoostly myrthe and Joy and conscience. For they
had no Joy in there good deeds / but in praysynge and flaterynge of the people.
And therefore christ says in the gospel. They have take there mede in this
world / and at the dome they shall be shette out of heaven bliss from endeles
mede / both flaterers and they that have liking in flaterynge / and do there
deeds only for flaterynge and praysynge of the people. But the five wise may
dens as the gospel says hadden oil in their lamps. That is to say ghoostly
Joy and liking in her good deeds. And therefore they shall be resceyued of
there husbonde christ in to y^ bliss without end. And as saint Austen says in
his sermon / by oil is understand both ghoostly praysynge and worldely
praysynge and myrthe Ghoostly praysynge and ghoostly myrthes is called the oil
of y^ holy ghost But worldely prysynge and worldely myrthe is called the oil
of sinners. And therefore he says that flaterers selle oil to the maidens
folys / that is to say to sinners as often as they flater them and praise
them in their folly and in there pride for to have mete or drink or money or
worship / or any temporal lucre / and so bring them in error and folly and
please and praise them in there sin. But as Dauyd says. Deus dissipauit ossa
eorum qui hommibus placent. God has destroyed and shall destroy the bones of
them that please men in despyte of god and desceyue men and women by flaterynge
/ wicked tongues do much harm and slay many souls / but the flaterynge tongue
is worste of all. And therefore the wise man says. Susurto et biliguis erit
maledictus a deo. Eccl.xxviij. The musterer and the double tonged man shall be
acursed of god / for he troubled much folk that have peace. The third tongue
says he has styred and moeued much people out of peace and dysparpled them
fro nacyon in to nacyon.

Caplm.iiij.
Dives. What is susurro that is called a musterer. Pauper It is a preuy rowner
/ that pryuely tells false tales among the people for to make dyscenco^n
and debate among the people / and tell tales pryuely which he dare not
tell openly ne may not auowe them. Of which folk saint Poule says.
Susurrones detractores deo odibiles. Ad Romanos.i. Such musterers and
bachyters god hates them. For susurro is a preuy bachyter and a preuy liar
that makes debate among friends. And as the wise man says. God hates all
tho that sown dyscorde among brethren and friends. Prouer.vi. And as he
says in an other place / such preuy musterers defoule there soul / and they
shall be hated of all both of god and of all the court of heaven. Eccl.xxi. And
therefore god says. Non eris susurro nec criminator in populis. Thou shall be no
musterer among the people to let leave and peace / ne thou shall be no tale
teller ne blabbe to defame man or woman falsely or any sin that is preuy.
Leuitici.xix. Such preuy musterers and bachyters make dyscencyon and heaviness
in every comonte / in every husholde / in every company. And therefore when they
be known for such they should be put out of company / or else chastysed. For
the wise man says / when the wood is withdraw the fire abateth and is
quenched. Right so says he withdraw such preuy musterers and bachyters and
put them out of company / and chiding and debate shall cesse. Prouer. xxvi.
Dives. What is bilinguis that thou called a double tongue man Pauper. Bilinguis
and the double tonged man is he that says one thing with his mouth / and
thinks an other in his heart / and he that speaks good before a man / and
behind him he speaks him evil / he that says a truth one time / and an
other time he forsakes it / as he that is unstable in speech / and now says
one and now an other. Of such god speaks and says. Os bilingue detestor
Prouerbiorum.viij. Iwlate and loathe the mouth that is double tonged. Dives.
What called the wise man the third tongue that does so much woo. Pauper. The
third tongue is the flaterynge tongue which is the worste of all. For every
flaterer that flatereth man or woman in his sin / he is a flaterer / he is a
bachyter / he is a double tonged / and so he may be called in latin trilinguis
/ that is treble tonged in English. The flaterer blyndeth so the folk that
he flateret / that they take no head to theymselfe ne to god / ne know not
themself and wax so proud that they give no tale of there even christian. Also
the flaterer lacks and bachyteth al tho that he hates / whom he flatereth so
to please him / and hyndereth an other man's name to enhaunce his name and so
makes dyscorde and dyscenco^n Also flaterers be double tonged. For as lyghtely
as they praysen man or woman / as lyghtely they will lack them if they fail
of there purpose and have no lucre by there flaterynge as they wend have had.
For commonly great praysers be great lackers / and as much as they praise man
or woman out of mesure by flaterynge / as much they will lack hy^ or an other
by bachytyng. Therefore Seneca says Lauda parce. vitupera percius. Praise
scarsely / but lack more scarsely. For these reasons Solomon says / that the
third tongue has styred much in to pride / and so made them fall in shame
and shenshyp and dysparpled them fro nacyon to nacyon. It has destroyed walled
towns / and dolue up the houses of great lords. It has kyt away the might
and the virtue of people that were full strong and made them feeble. For
flaterers make towns nacyons and lords bold to be gynne wars / plees and
debate / by which they come to naught. For they be so blent by flaterynge and
ouerpraysynge that they know not themself / but wene to ouerlede all men till
at the last they be destroyed themself. Also as the wise man says / the
thyr de tongue has cast strong woman / that is to say good weman syker and
virtuous out of there virtue / and pryued them and put them from their
trauayles. For when a good woman has trauayleth much of her life to please
god and to have a good name / comes a false flaterer in gyle and with
flaterynge words and fair byhestes of matrymony / or of rychesses brings
her to sin and does her to lose her good name and brings her to shame and
velony. And therefore says the wise man in the same place. Ecclesi. xxviij.
That who so takes head to the flaterynge tongue / that is the thyr de tongue to
have liking therein / he shall never have rest. And he shall have no friend in
whom he may rest ne trust / for flaterers be no true friends / but all blind
as men that they may not know there friends / ne take heed to the speech of
their friends yt would say them the soche and warn them of there harm.

Caplm.v.
Dives. That many a good woman is deceived and destroy de by flaterynge men
know well. But that flaterynge destroyed cytees / lords / houses / naco^ns /
and dy^per pled them from nacyon to nacyon I see not / but I pray the tell
some ensample. Paup. As we find in the fourth book of kings and the book of
Ieremye. For the childern of Israel would not here y^ words of Ieremye and of
other true prophets / ne do there after / but had liking in flaterynge of
false prophet which behyght them wealth and prosperyte for to plese the people
/ therefore was the cite of Jerusalem destroyed and nyghe all the cytees and
castellys of the land. The king sedechye was taken and his childern slain
before him / and after his eyes were put out. All the lords and the gentyles
of the land either they were slain or else led prisoners in to Babyloyn.
The people was slain with honger moreyn and sword. And all tho that were
left a live after yt the cite of Jerusalem was taken were dysparpled in
diverse nacyons / and slain in diverse manner / for they trusted always in
flaterynge of false prophets and sloughe Ieremye and other good prophets that
said them the truth and would have saved them. And I dare say that flaterynge
of false prophets and precho^rs / and of other spekers that blind the people
with plesaunt lesynges / ne will not undo to them there wickedness / is
pryncypall cause of destrucco^n of many realms lands people and cytees unto
this day as we might see at eye if flaterynge and lesynges blent us not.
Dives. Men preche these days full well ayenste sin. Pauper. Some do so / but
against the great sin yt all the land is entryked in / and all crystendome
knows and is open cause of our myscheef against that no man precheth but nyghe
al be about to maynten it. Dives Which sin is that Pauper Often have I told
the / but y^ byleuest me not. Go over the sea and there men shall tell it the
if y^ axe. We find in the third book of kings / yt the king of Israel whose
name was Achab was styred to besyege the cite of Ramathygalaad and so begin
war against the king of Syrye / this Achab sent after. iiij. hundred false
flaterynge prophets of his land / which were wont to plese him and to flater
him and axed them counseyll and how he should speed. They flatered him all and
bad him go and fight / and said that he should speed right well and take the
cite and destroy all the land of Syrye. Than at the counseyll of Iosephat the
king of Judah yt was come to help him / he sent for Michee gods prophet to
know what he would say. And as he came toward y^ king / the messangere said
to Michee the prophet. All other prophets with one mouth tell our lord the
king good tidings and say that he shall speed right well. I pray the say
as they say. Than the prophet answered / what my lord god says to me / that
shall I speak to our lord the king. And when he came before the king he said
to the king Achab. I saw by vyson all the people of Israel dysspar^led in y^
hills and scatered above as sheep without a shepeherde. Anon the king was
wroth and said that he told hy^ never good ne wealth. Than the prophet said.
Here the word of god. I saw our lord god sitting on his sete / and all the
oost of heaven standing besides him on the right side and on the lift side.
Than said our lord god. Who shall desceyue Achab king of Israel to do him goo
and fight in Ramath^galaad and fall in fight. Anon a wicked spyryte stood
forth and said. I shall desceyue him. Than our lord axed him how he should
desceyue him. I shall said he go out and be aspryte liar in the mouth of all
his false prophets. Than our lord god said. Thou shall desceyue him and thou
shall have the maystrye of him. Go forth and do as thou haste said. Than the
king was more wroth and co^maunyed him to prysone. The king left the
counseyll of the prophet Michee and followed the counseyll of his false
prophets / and went to battle and was slain / and his people dyscounfyted.
Dives. Dauyd speaks much in his book of the gylous tongue / that is called in
latin. lin gua dolosa. Pauper. The gylous tongue is the flaterynge tongue. For
commonly every gy^e in speech is meddled with flaterynge. In gylous speech be two
things / sleyght and flaterynge And therefore gylous speech is lykened to an
anglynge of fysshe. For in the anglynge be two things / the hoke and the mete
on the hoke. The hoke is the sleyght in speech / the mete on the hoke is
flaterynge that draws man and woman on to the deuylles hoke. Thus Adam and
Eve were dysceyued with y^ fendes speech / for slyly he axed Eve why god bad yt
they should not ete of every tree in paradyse. And when he saw her unstable
and doubting he put thereto y^ mete of flaterynge and said / yt they should not
deye but be as gods konwynge good and wicked And so by flaterynge the fend
lost all mankind. Figure here of we have in y^ second book of kings.xx.ca.
where we find yt Ioab gylously sloughe the noble prince Amasam with a knyfe
craftily made lightly to go out of the shethe. And when he should steke him
with the knyfe he took him by the chynne and said to him heyle my brother. And
for his flaterynge and fair words Amasa took no head to the knyfe. And in the
same manner when Judas betrayed christ he said in flaterynge and gyle Aue rabi.
Heyle thou master.

Caplm.vi.
Dives. Thou haste well declared the myscheef of flaterynge tongues. Say forth
what y^ wylt. Pauper. Also god forbedeth us by this commandment yt we slay no
man ne woman by our de de him a mys doing or him hurtynge. And so by this
commandment he forbedeth us wrath and wretch / chiding / despysynge /
smiting / scornynge / and all such means and motyues to manslaughter. Dives.
As thou well saydest god forbyddeth not all manner of manslaughter / but only
manslaughter vnryghtfully and against the law. For god badde that men should
not suffer wicked doers live in disease of the people. Malificos no^ pacieris
viuere. Exo.xxij. And also he bad yt we should slay no manne woman ryghtfully
and unguilty. Innocente^ et iustum no^ occides. Exo. xxiij. Therefore I pray the
tell me in how many manners a man is slain vnryghtfully. Pauper. On three
manners. First if he be slain without gylte. Also if he be slain without order
and process of law. Also if he be slain without lawful Justice ordained of
his liege lord to whom god has given life and lyme and the sword to punysshe
shrewes / as saint Poulo shows well in his pystle. Ad Romanos xiij. Also if
he be slain by enmyt / hate / and cruelte for to have vengeance / not for
salvation of the truth and of the people.

Caplm.vij.
Dives. Thy speech is reasonable say forth. Pauper. Also if any man or woman
dye for defaute of help. Than all that should have help them and might have
help them and wyste thereof and would not help them be gylty of manslaughter.
And therefore says the law. Pasce fame mor^entem si non pascis occidis. dis^.
lxxxvi. pasce. That is to say. Feed him that is in point to deye for hongre.
If y^ will not feed him when thou might thou sleest him. Much more than they
be mansleers that by extorcyon / raueyne and ouerledynge by might fraud and
gyle rob men of there good / or withholde men of there good whereby they should
live / and bring them so in thought / sorrow / and care / and so haste her
death. Therefore god says that such manner folk as tyrauntes extorcyoners and
false men devour his people as the mete of bread. Deuorant plehem meam sicut
escam panis And therefore he forbydeth them and says to them. Lysten ye
princes and lords and leders of the people / to you it longs to know right
full dome to deem what is good and what is wicked / what is truth and what is
false. But now ye hate good things and love wyked things / and loathe
goodness and love shrewednesse. By vyolence and might ye hylde men and take
their sins from them and take there flesh from the boones. These ete the
flesh of my people / and held away there skynnes fro above them and break
their boones. Mychee.iij. And so all such be mansleers in gods sight / for
they have man's death by myscheef / and sorrow and care that they bring them
in. Dives. What is under stand here by skin flesh and bones. Pauper. Three
things be needful to every man and woman lynynge hylynge lyfelode / and help
of friends in feebleness and disease. By the skin that hylleth and clothe the
flesh is understand clothing housynge / armure by which man is hyled and
defended fro tempests / cold and hot and enemies and many dyseases. By
flesh is understand mete and drink whereby the flesh is nourysshed. By the
bones that bear up the flesh and strength the flesh ben understand man's
friends which help him at need / and bear him up and strength him feblenesse
and disease. But these tyrau^tes and extorcyoners and false folk take away
the skin of the poor folk / for they robb them of there housynge and of there
clothing. And they ete away there flesh / for they take away there lyuelode
whereby there flesh should be sustained. For they pylle them so and make them
so poor / that they have neither house ne home / ne clothing to their body /
ne mete ne drink to live by Also they break there bones / for they pursue there
friends yt would help them and put them in such dread that they dare not help
them and often beat them and break there bones and mayme them. Example of this we
have in the third book of kings / where we find yt there was a true man
dwelling besides the paleyce of Achab that was king of Israel / and the
poor man was called Naboth. And for he would not selle his gardeyn to the
king at his will the king was wroth. And by false dome and false witness he
did him be stoned to death / and so by fraud and manslaughter he escheted to
him the poor man's gardeyn / wherefore the king afterward was slain. And
the queen Iesabell for she assented and halpe to the death of the true man / and
was slain also / and the hounds ete her flesh and her bones and lycked up
her blood in vengeance of the death of Naboth. The king was slain in war /
his wife Iesabell was cast out of her chamber wyndowe and trod to death with
fete of horses. And other two kings of her alyau ce / and nyghe all her
kynrede was slain afterward in vengeance of the death of Naboth. Achab had
sixty sons and ten living after his death and they were byheded in vengeance
of the death of Naboth.iiij. regnm.x.

Caplm.viij.
ALso they be gylty of manslaughter that defraude servants of their hyre.
Therefore the wise man says. That he that takes away from the servant his
bread and his lyuelode that they have gotten in swyncke and sweet / is as wicked
as he that sleeth his neighbor. And he yt sheddeth man's blood / and he that
does fraud to the hired man be brethern. That is to say / they be like in
sin and worthy in like pain. Qui effundit sanguinem et qui fraudem facit
mercenario sunt tratres. Ecclesiastici. xxxiiij. And therefore saint James says
thus to the false rich couetouse men. See ye how the hyre of your work men
and laborers that have reped your feldes is defrauded by you and not paid
cries to god for vengeance. And the cry of them is entered in to the ^e^es
of the lords of oostes. Iabobi quinto capitulo. And the wyle man says / that
who so offers sacrefyce of the poor man's good / is like him that sleeth
the sone in the sight of his fader. And he yt defrauded the poor man of his
good is a mansleer. Homo sanguinis est. Ecclesiastici.xxxiiij. Dives. This
point of manslaughter touches much men of holy church. For as the law
says. The tithes of holy church be trybutes of them that be in need. To
reuele them in their need And all that men of holy church have / it is the
poor men's goods. And their houses should be common to all men at their need.
They should be besy to resceyue pylgremys / and keep hospytalyte after their
power / xvi.q^.i. decime. et c. quam quicquid. Wherefore me thinks / if any
poor folk perysshe by there defaute and for that that they would not help
them / they be gylty of manslaughter. Pauper That is sothe. And therefore christ
said thryes to saint Peter. Palce. That is to say feed my lambs and my sheep
that be tho souls that christ bought with his blood. For prelates and curates
of holy church must feed there sugettes by good ensamples gynynge / and by
help at need. And therefore christ said twyes to saint Peter / feed my lambs /
but the third time he said / feed my sheep. For as long as they be lambs /
they give neither milk ne wolle / but when these be waxen sheep / they give
both milk and wolle. And so christ in his words bad that prelates and
curates of holy church should have double cure of the poor people to feed
them goostly and also bodily with bodily help at need. But they be not bound
to feed the rich folk but goostly and them that have no need with holy
chirches goods. And of the poor folk give they no tale / but to pylle them /
and have of them / and get of them what they may by ypocresy / by fraud /
by dread and vyolence. And therefore god vndernemeth them by the prophet
Ezechyell and says to them thus. Ve pastoribus israel. Woo be to the
shepeherdes of Israel That is to say to the prelates and curates of holy
church / which should be shepeherdes of gods sheep and of the souls that
christ bought so dear. Woo be to the shepeherdes / for they feed themself /
and of the poor people give they no tale / ye ete says he the milk and
clothed you with the wolle And that was fat ye slow to feed well your womb
/ but ye feed not my flock of my people that was feeble / ye helped it not ne
conforted not And that was sore and seek ye heled it not And that was broke ye
bound it not again / that was cast away and fordreuen / ye fetched it not
again / ne led it again. That was perysshed / ye sought it not but with ferenes
and hardenes and by power without pity ye commanded to them many great
things and grievous and reigned among them as Emperors / and so my sheep be
scatered. For there is no shepeherde that gives any tale of them.
Ezechielis.xxxiiij. And in a another place he says thus. Woo be to the
shepeherdes that thus descateren and forrende the flock of my lesue and of my
pasture. Jeremy.xxiij And therefore god accepts not the prayer of such men
of holy church. For they be without charity and full of crueltee in pyllynge
of the poor people. And therefore he says to them Cum extenderitis manus
vestras and^ When ye shall lift up your hands to me. I shall torn mine eyes
away fro you / and when ye should multyplye prays to me. I shall not here
you. For your hands be full of blood. Ysaye.i. Upon which words thus says
the great clerk Grosthede. dicto.xxiij. An unjust scheder of man's blood
has blody hands. For blood shede out is in the hands of him that is the
shedder out / as the effeccyon of the work is in the cause. For the hand of
the shedder is cause of blood shed. So than sythen bodily fode is cause of
blood of man's body by which his life transyto rye is sustained / he that
withdraws sustenau^ce fro the poor in myscheef he withdraws from the poor
man his blood whereby his life should be sustained. And therefore god says that
the blood of the poor folk is in the hands of them / in whose hands the
things be withholde unjustly. By which things or by the pryse of thoo nedy
folk should be sustained. Also all thoo that withholde poor men there good /
either by vyolence or by fraud or theft or any dysceyte by which good the
poor folk should live / they have their hands defouled with blood of pore
folk. And in that that they fare delycately with poor man's good / they ete
and drink the blood of the poor folk. And there clothing is defouled with
blood of poor folk. And if they housen and bylden with the poor man's good
/ they ground there housyng in the blood of poor men.

Caplm.ix.
ALso every man and woman and namely men of holy church that draw folk to
sin by mys entysyng or by wicked en samples / or by false lore / they be
gylty of manslaughter gostly. And therefore saint Gregory says in his omelye /
that men of holy church be gylty of as many dethes as they draw souls to
dedely sin by there wicked ensample and there wicked living. And therefore
christ byddeth in the gospel that there should no man sclaundre the lewed
simple folk. For who so does it / it were better to him that he were call in
the seewith a mylstone about his neck / with word as the gloss says / is
specially said for men of holy church. And therefore saint Pou^e says to al
christian people and namely to prestes and clerks. Ne ponatis offendiculu^
fri^bus vel scandalu. That is to say as the gloss says. Do no thing yt may
be cause of falling and perysshynge of your brethern / ne cause of sorwe and
heaviness. And roma.xiiij And therefore yt law byddeth yt when bishops and
offyeers go about for to vy syt^^ that they should do no tyrau^trye In taking
of there costs but vysyte with charity and lowenes without pomp of great array
and of great main besye to amend the fautes / and to preche gods word and
to win man's soul / not to rob the folk of there good / but take there
costs in easy manner. So that they slau^dre not there brethern ne there sugettes
/ ne be not greuouse to them.x.q^.iij.cauendu. All men and namely men of holy
church must besely flee sclaundre that they give no man ne woman occa s;yon
of sclaundre ne of sin / but oftentyme live to harder and absteyne them fro
many things lefull to flee sclaundre. For as saint Ierom says su^ Micheam.
All that give occasyon of sclau^dre be gylty of all tho yt perysshe by the
sclau^dre.i.q^.i.hij quoscu^que Et nota pro vitando scandalo in rebus licitis.
ad Roma.xiij.et.i.ad little. vin. For these causes god says to the men of holy
church by the prophet Ozee. Ye be made snare to men lokynge a fer / and as a
net sprede abrede on y^ hylle of Tabor / and ye have bowed down sacrefyces in
to yt depnes / yt is to say / ye yt ought to beware lokers to work well and
warn men of peril of sin / be made a snare and a net in holy church /
that is y^ hylle of Tabor / to take folk in sin and draw them to folly. And
so ye have slain souls and bowed them down in to the depnes of dampnaco^n /
and so made sacrefyce to the devil of the souls that god took you to keep.
Ozee.v. Also men of holy church slay there sugettes goostly that mys eggynge /
mys counsel and mys enformaco^n bring them in dedely sin and in heresye /
or else let them from good deeds yt they would do and so slain in good
purpose and good will yt man or woman is in and in manner slain there faith
whereby they should live. For the prophet says Iustus ex fide viuit. The
ryghtfull man lives by faith. And saint James says That faith without good
works of charity is but deed. And also prayer without dyuocyon is but ded as
these clerks say. Dives. Than nyghe all the prayers yt men make be but deed.
For commonly in our prayer we be destracte and think on other things. And it
is not possible to us always to think on that what we say. For there is no
thing so chau^geable as thought / and though we thy^ke on what we say / yet it
is not in our power without special gift of god to have devotion there in.
Paup. Take it not so strayte. For it is understand thus. Prayer without
devotion is but deed. That is to say. Prayer made against devotion is but deed.
Dives. How against devotion Pauper. As when men pray against the salvation of our
souls or other souls / and not for the worship of god / but for ypocresye /
or only for worldely lucre. Or when men pray against charity / as for to have
vengeance of there enemies / or for any thing against gods worshyp^ and in
their prayer submytte not there will to the will of god. Every prayer yt is made
to the worship of god by way of charity and for a good end with purpose to
please god / yt prayer is made with devotion / though he that prays be
dystracte and thinks not on his words / and peradventure understands them
not / ne has but little liking therein. Nethelesse man and woman ought to do
their devour to think on god / and of that that he says in his prayer.

Caplm.x.
Dives. Thy speech pleases me / say forth what thou wylt Pauper. As I said
first all that let man or woman of there good deeds and good purpose and tyse
them to sin and folly / and bring them in error or heresye by mysse te
chynge be mansleers and lymmes of the fend. Which as christ says in the
gospel is a manqueller from the beginning of the world. For through his
mysse counseyll and his fodynge he slough all mankind both goostly and bodily
at the beginning of the world. Also he sloughe him self through pride and
many a thousands of angellys that assented to him And yet he cesseth not to
slay man's soul by false suggestyons and temptacyons / and that by himself
and when men see him not. And sometime vysybely in the likeness of some vysyble
creature / and so he tempted christ and Eve and saint Martyn and many other
Sometime he te^pteth and sleeth man's soul by his ly^mes yt be wicked men and
wymen. Also men of holy church slay men and wymen goostly of gods word and
of good techynge. For as christ says. No^ in solo pane viuit homo sed in omni
vbo quod procedit de ore dei. Math.iiij. Man lives not only in bodily bread /
but much more he lives in every word that comes of gods mouth / that is
to say / in the words of the true prechour. For every true prechour sent of
god / is called gods mouth. And therefore god says to the prophet. Si
seperaueris preciosum a vili quasi os meum eris. Jeremy.xv. If thou depart
precyouse thing from thing that is foul and of no pryse / thou shall be as
my mouth. For it longs to the prechour of gods word to commend virtues
and despise vices / to chese truth and let falsehode / to commend heaven
bliss and ghoostly things / and repreue pomp and pride of this world and
flesshely things. And than is the prechour as gods mouth and speaks with
gods mouth / and his word is gods word / by the whithe man and woman
lives goostly and escapes endeles death. And therefore Dauyd says. Misit
verbu^ su^ et sanaunt eos. et eripuit eos de entericionibus eorum. God has
sent his word and has heled his people from ghoostly sekenes / and delivered
them from there deynge when they should have deyed through sin and hell
pain. And therefore he says in the gospel. That who so keeps his word / he
shall not a taste the death without end. Sythen that gods word is life and
salvation of man's soul / all tho that let gods word / and let them
that have auctoryte of god and by order take to preche and teache that they may
not preche and teache gods word and gods law / they be mansleers ghoostly
and gylty of as many souls as perysshe and deye ghoostly by such lettynge of
gods word / and namely these proud couetouse prelates and curates that
neither can teache ne will teache / ne suffer other that can and will and have
auctoryte to teache of god and of the bishop that gives them their ordres /
but let them for dread that they should have the less of there sugettes or
else the less be set by / or else that there sins should be known by
prechynge of gods word And therefore lever they have to lose the souls yt
christ so dear bought than to here there own sins openly repreued generally
among other me^nes sins. As saint Austen says gods word ought to be
worshypped as much as crystus body. And as much sin does he that lets
gods word and despised gods word or takes it retchelesly as he yt
despyseth gods body / or through his neclygence leteth it fall to the
ground.i.q^.i.int^trogo vos. There the gloss shows / that it is more
profitable to here gods word in prechynge / than to here any mass. And
rather a man should forbere his mass than his sermon For by prechynge folk be
s^yred to contrycyon and to forsake sin and the fend / and to love god and
goodness and be Illumyned to know there god and virtues from vices truth from
falsehode / and to forsake erroures and heresies. By the mass be they not so /
but if they come to mass in sin / they goo away in sin / and shrewes they
come / and shrewes they wend. And also the virtue of yt mass stands
pryncypally in true believe of the mass / and specially of christ that is there
sacred in the oost. But yt may man learn by prechynge of gods word / and not
by herynge of mass And in so much herynge of gods word truly preched is
better than he ring of mass. Nethelesse the mass profyteth them that be in
grace to get the more grace and fotgyuenes of ve nyall sin / and
encreassynge of mede / and lesynge the pain of purgatory And the priest may be
so good / that his prayer for reuecence of the sacrament shall gese grace of
amendeme^t of hy^ yt he prays for. Both be good but gods word ought to be
more charged and more desired than he ring of mass. For when the people
despyseth gods word / and loath gods word / yt is ghoostly fode to man y^
people is but deed in gods sight / and nyghe to the gates of hell. And
therefore Dauyd says. Omne^ escam abhominata est anima eorum. et
appropinquauerunt vsque ad portas mortis There souls have lothed all goostely
mete / that is to say / all true prechynge and techynge of gods word and
so they be neyghed to the yates of death.

ALso tho prelates and curates be gylty of manslaughter goostely yt know there
sugettes in dedely sin / and will not snybbe them ne speak against there sin.
di.xliij. epheseis. And therefore god says to every curate and prelate of holy
church, and to prechours of gods word. I have made the a day wait to the
people of Israel / yt is to say to christian people and y^ shall here the word
of my mouth and tell it them in my name. And if I say to the sinful yt he
shall d^ye and thou tell it him not / ne speak not to him that he may amend
him and torn him fro his wicked way and life yt sinful wretch for thy
defaute shall deye in his sin. And I shall seek the blood and the death of
him of thyn hand / and y^ shall answer for his death Eze.iij. Also they called
mansleers that defraude and take away holy church goods.xij.q^.ij.qui xp^i
and^. qui abstulerit. Also that priest is a mansleer ghoostely that denies the
sacrament of penance to man or woman in his last end and will not assoyle
them when they repent them and axe absolucyon. For so they put folk in
dyspayre against the goodness and mercy of god that is endeles and always ready
to all that seek mercy / as long as the soul and the body be knyt to gydre.
Example of the thief that hynge on the right side of christ / the which of
pain knowleched his sin and axed grace and gate the bliss of paradyse /
when he said lord have thou mind of me / when thou come in to thy kingdom.
And anon christ ryghtful Judge yt best knew his heart said to him. I say the
forsooth / this day thou shat be with me in paradyse.xxvi.q^.vi si presbiter
and^. agnouimus. Where the law says That they that be so hard upon men in
there deynge / do not else but put death to death. Death of soul to death of
body Dives. Much folk presume so much on y^ mercy of god / that they give
no tale to live in there sin much of all there life in hope to have mercy in y^
last end. Pauper And yet if they axe mercy in due manner they shall have mercy
/ as y^ law says well in y^ same place / and holy write in many places. For
god says by the prophet Ezechielis.xxxiij.ca. That in what hour y^ sinner
sygeth for his sin and axe mercy I shall forgive him his sin and forgete
his sin Netheles I dare not behote such folk y^ they should have grace
stead and time to axe mercy as them needs to axe. For commonly such manner
folk be dysceyued by sudden death / or else in there deynge they lose there
hedes and there wits / and begin to rave. Or else they have so much pain
in their body and so much business with the world / that they think
neither of god ne of themself. And as saint Austen says in his sermon de
Innocentibus. Iusto dei iudicio agit^ vt moriens obliuiscat^ sui. qui du^
viueret oblitus est. It is gods ryghtfull dome that he forgete himself in
his deynge that has forgeten god in his living. As fell in england besides
Oxenford. There was a tyrant in the country yt dredde not god ne had pity of
man. Often men preched him and cou^seyled him to good. He had despyte of there
words / and said yt if he might have three words before his deynge / he should
be saved as well as the best man living. At the last it befell that he rode
by the way to be on a queste before a Justice. And he began to sleep / his
horse stombled and he fill down and brake his neck. And in his falling he
said with great heart. Ore vaunte a deblis. That is to say in English. Now
forth to the devil. And so he had three words to his da^pnacyon / not to his
salvation. Therefore the wise man says. De propiciatu pcco^rum noli esse sine
metu. Be not without dread of forgyuesse of thy sins / ne put sin to sin
/ ne say not that the mercy of god is great / he shall have mercy on the
multitude of thy sins / for mercy and wrath also hastily come fro him nyghe
to mankind. But his wrath looks to sinners yt will not amend them and his
mercy to them yt will amend them. Ne tardas conuerti ad dominu^ and^.
Therefore let not to turn the to god / and delay not from day to day. For
if ye do / his wrath shall come suddenly and destroy the. Ecclesiastici. v.
For such folk that be so bold in their sin in hope of the mercy of god and
do the worse because of his goodness / they scorn god and seek vengeance and
no mercy. They take heed to his mercy / and not to his ryghtfulnesse. Dauyd
says. Universe vie dn^i misericordia et veritas. All the ways of god and all
his domes be mercy and troth. If thou seek mercy it were against his
ryghtfulnesse but he showed mercy / and but thou seek mercy ryghtfulnesse must
dampne the. Seek mercy / and mercy and his ryghtfulnesse will save the / if
thou seek it in due manner.

Dives. These words be good and confortable and reasonable. Say forth what
thou wylt. Pauper. Also he is a mansleer ghoostely / that makes any man or
woman to forswere them. For he sleeth his own soul and his soul that he
does so forswere him.xxij.questione.v. ille. Also men slay themself as
oftentyme as they assent to wicked thoughts in heart / and turn them away
fro god in whom is all our life And therefore Solomon says. Auersio paruulorum
interficiet eos. Prouer.i. That the tournynge away of the little childern slay
them. For they that soon be overcome in temptaco^n and soon assent to the
fend / be lykened to young childern yt be faint and feeble to withstand any
thing. Of such childern god says / yt a child of an hundred year shall be
acursed of god Ysa. lxv. Also they slay there souls yt gydre foul lustys and
unlawful desires in there heart and will not redely put them out. Therefore the
wise man says. Desideria occidu^t pigru^. Prouer.xxi. Wicked desires sle them
yt is slow to put them out. And therefore Dauyd says Beatus ^ tenebit et
allidet peruulos suos ad petra^. Blessed be he that shall hold him with god
and smite down his small young thoughts and desires to the stone / that is
christ. Blessed is he that anon as he begins to have such wicked thoughts
anon begin to think on crystus passion / and of gods law as saint Jerome
says in his pystle. ad Paula^ et Eustochiu^. Dives. It follows of thy words
that wh^ so does any dedely sin / he is a mansleer. And so every sin is
forboden by this commandment. Non occides. Thou shall not slay. Why yaue than
god ten commandments sythen they be all comprehended in one. Pauper. For
dulnes of man's wit / it needs to give mothan one to declare man's sin /
yt he may know when he synneth / and how he may flee sin. All the law and
all the ^phecye as christ says in the gospel hangs in two commandments
of charity which teache us to love our god above all thing / and out even
christian as our self. But yet god would declare tho two commandments by ten
commandments yt man and woman should y^ better know them and please him /
and the more flee his offense. Dives. Why declared he the^ more by ten
commandments than by twelve or by nine / for he might have given many mo
when he gave but ten. Pauper. To give ouermoche many was not profitable / ne to
give over few. And therefore god gave his byhestes in the nombre of ten / for
as ten is nombre perfyght and conteyneth all nombres / so gods law is
perfyght and all is comprehended in ten byhestes that been so knytte to gydre /
and of so great acorde / that who so trespaceth in one he trespaceth in all.
And therefore says saint James in his pystle. That though a man keep all the
law / and he offend in one he is gylty in all. For why says he / god y^ bad
the do no lecherye / he bad the not slay. And therefore says he. Though thou do
no lecherye and y^ slay / thou break s;te the law. Iacovi.i. For as saint
Austen says in libro de december cordis All the ten commandments be contained
in the two commandments of charity. And the two commandment of charity be
contained and knytte in this one commandment of kind. O d tibi ne vis fieri.
alteri no^ facias. Tobie.iiij. That yt thou wylt not be do to the do it not to
an other. And so as saint Austen says there. All the law is contained in this
one commandment of kind. That thou wylt not be do to the / do it thou not to
none other. And so needs he that offends in one offends in all. And
therefore Dauyd and saint Austen also call gods law a sawtree and an harp
of ten cordys. And therefore Dauyd byddeth us praise god in the harp / and in
the sawtree of ten cordys. That is to say in good keeping of the ten
commandments. Confitemini domino in cithara in psalterio dece^ cordarum
psallite illi. And if it be so / yt one cord in the sawtree or in the harp be
broke / or out of tune of a cord with other cords / all the song that played
therein shall be vnlykynge to all that here it and not pleasant. As the master
of kind tells Li.xviij. That though the harp be well strynged with strings
made of a sheep / and there be one string that is made of a wolf set in the
harp / it shall make all other at dyscorde. So that they should not accord
while it is there. And it shall frete atwo all the other cordys. Right so
though a man or a woman keep well all the commandments as to man's sight /
if he break one he is gylty in all in gods sight / as saint James says and
his life. While he is such it is not pleasant to god. And the song of his
harp / that is his living and his conuersacyon is at dyscorde with god and
all the court of heaven / and as the wolf is always contrary and enmye to the
sheep / so is he at dyscorde and enmye to gods sheep / that be all tho y^ be
in way of saluaco^n. And as long as y^ kepest well the ten behestys in
lowness / so long the strings of shine harp be in good acorde as y^
strings that be made of a sheep. But if thou follow the manners of the wolf /
and break any of gods commandments by gyle / by raueyne / by malice and
false couetyse / by false contryuynge / than thou make in thyn harp a
string of the wolf / which shall shende the harp of thy living and destroy
it / but thou do it away by sorrow of heart / shryfte of mouth and amends
making.

Caplm.xiij.
Dives. I would see more openly how he yt synneth in one synneth in all ten
commandments. Pauper. If yt trespace in manslaughter / you crespacest against
all ten behestys. For you vnworshyppest thy god / in y^ that you brekest his
commandment / and so defoule his image. Also you take in vain his name /
that is christ and christian. For thou do not as a christian man should do. Also
thou halowest not from sin as god bad the by the third commandment. Also
thou despysest and not worship peste fader and mother / that be god and holy
church / and thy bodily fa d and mother. For thy wicked tatches be shame and
shenshyp to thy fader and mother. Also thou do lecherye in y^ that thou
love thy wicked will and thy malice more than god. And for to have thy wicked
will performed thou forsakest god and take thy soul to the devil. For what
thing that man loves more than god / with that thing he does goostly
lechery and fornycacyon and auoutre. Also you bereste false witness and lie
many lesynges to mayntene thy sin / or else to hyde it. Also you stelest thy
soul and his soul whom you sleest fro god that bought him so dear. Also when
thou sleest thou do against the nynthe and the tenthe commandment. For
every man slaughter is do for couetyse of vengeance / or for couetyse of
erthely good or for couetyse of flesshely lust / as of men's wives / or of
their childern / or of their servants / or for couetyse of worship / so that
if thou slay thou forfettest against all ten commandments. And so it may be
showed of each of all ten / that he that breketh one breketh all / and he yt is
gylty in one dedely sin is gylty in all seven / and in all the.x.
commandment. And in token of this saint Johan saw a woman sitting on a read
be full of names of blasphemye / which be had vij. hedes and.x. horns
Apo.xvij. By this woman is understand pr^de and vanyte of this world. By y^
read best yt she sat on is understand the fend and dedely sin yt is full of
blasphemye against god. This be had.vij. hedes and ten horns. That is to
say.vij. dedely sins and brekynge of the.x. commandments / in token yt
what man or woman falls in any dedely sin openly / he falls in all seven
pryuely in gods sight. And when he breketh one commandment he breketh all.
And therefore says saint James / that he yt offends in one offends in all
and is gylty in all. Iacobi.ij.

Caplm.xiiij.
Dives. What longs to the o^maundement of kind that Saint Austen speaks of
to the love of god / or to the commandments of the first table. For we may
do to god neither good ne evil. Pauper. Soth it is that we may not do to god
neither good ne evil. And yet as saint Austen says in the same book. De
december cordis. This commandment of kind byddeth us to love our god and serve
him well and truly / and keep all his byhestes. For why all we be gods
servants. And if y^ had a servant says saint Austen / thou would that
thy servant served the well and truly. I pray the than says he serve thou
well and truly thy god / that is thy lord and his lord. Thou would that thy
servant were true to the and not falls / be thou not falls to god. Thou would
that no man should defoule thy wife / defoule thou not thy soul / that is
gods spouse ne none other soul. Thou would that no man should destroy
thyn house ne defoule it / defoule thou not than gods temple / that is every
clean christian soul. Defoule it not by lecherye ne by no dedely sin. For
saint Poule says / that who so defouleth gods temple / god shall destroy
him. Thou would thy servant kept well thy commandments / and did not
against thy bidding / keep than thou gods commandments and do not against
his bidding. Thou would that no man despise thyn image painted on a board /
despise thou not gods image by any dedely sin For sythen thou may not
please god in sin and shrewednesse / therefore you offendest thy god in thy
sin and thy corrupcyon / and do wrong to him thyselfe. Thou do wrong
to his grace / to his gift / thou may not do wrong to thy brother / but you
do wrong to god yt is thy lord and his also. And therefore says saint Johan
in his pystle / that who so says yt he loves god and he hate his brother / he
is a liar.i. Io iiij. For in that he does wrong pryncypaly to god and to his
brother also. And therefore god says. Quicu^que effuderit hamanu^ sanguinem.
effude^ sanguinis eius. Gen^.ix. He that sheddeth out man's blood wronfully /
his blood shall be shed For why says he / man is made to the lykenes of god.
And so manslaughter is open wrong do to god in yt that his servant is so
slain and his image despised and destroyed. Therefore god said to the first
mansleer / that was Caym which sloughe his brother Abell falsely for envy of
his own goodness. What have thou do Caym. The voice of the blood of Abell
thy brother cries to me fro earth and axeth vengeunce of the. And therefore
thou shall be cursed upon earth / which has opened his mouth and has take
the blood of thy brother Abell of thyn hand. Thou shall trauayll in tylthe of
the land and it shall give y^ no fruit. Thou sqalt be (...) derynge and
flemed upon earth. (...) And the same vengeasice comon^^ follows murdre. For
murdre may not be hid / but night and day it axeth vengeance. The murdre
shall myshappe in his doing / and be unstable and wandering and odyous in his
living. This sin of manslaughter is so grievous in gods sight / that he
commanded in the old law that if any man by laynge in awayte or by preuy
aspyenge or by purpose killed any man / and after fled to gods auter for
socour / he should be taken away thens and be slain for that death Exo.xxi. And
therefore saint Johan says in the book of gods pryuytees that he yt sleeth
shall be slain. Apo. xiij. For as christ says in the gospel That same mesure
yt men mete to other / shall be moten again to them. And therefore in time of his
passion he said to Peter. Put up thy sword / for each man yt uses sword to
shed man's blood without lawful power granted of god / shall perysshe by
the sword / that is to say by sword of bodily vengeance / or by the sword
of gods mouth / which is full sharp on every side punysshynge both body
and soul. Apo.i. For commonly he that uses the sword / or any wepen to slay
any man or woman he sleeth first himself by the sword of his own malice.
But trespasours that will not be amended in other manner / may by Just dome be
slain by them that bear the sword of temporal punysshynge / as saint Poule
says. Ad Romanos.xiij.

Caplm.xv.
Dives. It seems to much folk that god forbydeth by his commandment all
manner sleynge both of man and of best. For he said generally. Non occides. Thou
shall not slay. Paup. By this word occides in latin he specyfyeth and she weth
yt he forbydeth sleynge of man / and not of be. For occasio in latin is in
english manslaughter. quasi hominu cesio. And therefore y^ propre english is
this. Non occides / you shall not slay no man. Dives. When god said the sixth
byhest. Tu no^ mechaberis That is to say / y^ shall do no lecherye / he
forbydeth all manner lecherye. And when he said the seven byhestes. Non furtu^
facies. That is you shall not stele / he forbydeth al manner theft both of man
and of be and of all other things. And by the same reason as me thinks
when he bad us not slay / he forbadde us all manner sleynge. Pauper. It it not
the same reason ne like that reason. For as I said first by properte of the
same word. Occides. He forbydeth only manslaughter. God granted man power to
slay bestes and live thereby. Gen^ ix. But he granted him never to do lechery
with any creature / ne take any thing by way of stelynge / or of false
couetyse. Dives. Contra te. We find that Balaam rode on his ass to curse
gods people against gods will. An angel stood in a right straight way
against him. The ass saw the angel and fled aside for dread of y^ angels
sword and bare Balaam against the wall and brosed his foot Balaam saw not the
adgell. And therefore he was wroth with the ass and smote him full hard / than
the ass through the might of god under name Balaam his master and said to
him. What have I do against the / why betest thou me. Than Balaam said. For thou
haste well deserved it / would god I had a sword to slay the. Than the ass
said again. Have I not always be thy be on which thou haste be wont always
to ride. Say when I did ever the such disease unto this day. And anon god
opened the eyes of Balaam / and than he saw the angel standing against him
with his sword drawn. And the angel said to Balaam / why haste y^ so beten
thyn ass. For but thyn ass had gone out of the way and given me place I
should have slain the / and the ass should lived. Numeri.xxij. Sythen than it
is so y^ Balaam was blamed for he bette his ass not withstanding that he
hurt him / much more he should have be blamed if he had slain him. And so it
seems yt it is not lefull to slay any be. Paup It is granted to man to
slay bestes when it is profitable to him for mete or clothing / or to avoid
noyau^ce of the bestes which be noyouse to man And therefore god said to Noe
and to his childern. Also fysshes in the sea be take to your power and to your
hands and all thing that styreth and lives up on earth / be and bird
shall be to you in mete. I have take them all to you as grene herbs / out
taken y^ ye shall not ete flesh with the blood. Gen^.ix And in an other place
he says thus. If the like to ete flesh / slay and ete after the grace and
gift that god has given the / so that thou ete it without blood. Deut^.xij.
And so granted god to man for to slay bestes fysshe and foul to his prouffyte
/ but not to slay them for cruelte / ne for liking in vanyte and shrewednesse.
And therefore when he forbadde man to ete flesh with the blood / he forbadde
him to slay bestes by way of cruelte / or forlykynge of shrewednesse. And
therefore he said. Ete ye no flesh with the blood / that is to say / with
crueltee. For I shall seek the blood of your souls of the hand of all bestes
/ that is to say. I shall take vengeance for all the bestes that ye have
slain only for cruelte of soul and liking in shrewednesse. Gen^.ix. For god
that made all has cure of all. And he shall take vengeance of all that mysu
s;e his creatures. And therefore Solomon says / that he shall arm creatures in
vengeance of his enemies. Armabit creatura^ in vlcionem immicorum Sapie.v. And
therefore men should have rueth on bestes of birds and not harm them without
cause in taking reward that they be gods creatures And therefore they that
for cruelte and vanyte byheded bestes and torment bestes or foul more than it
is spedefull for man's living / they sin in case full grievously.

Caplm.xvi.
Dives. As thou saydeste before by this commandment is forboden all wronful
manslaughter. Tell me in what case it is leful to slay any man. Pauper. Sometime
manslaughter is do by hate and enmyte / as when a man is slain malycyously of
his enmye. Sometime it is do for wicked couetyse to have a man's good. Sometime
it is do by order of obedyence and process of law / as when a man is slain
by a queste and by sentence of a Judge ordynary. Semtyme manslaughter is do for
need ^ for help of the comonte / and for the saluaco^n of them that be
unguilty. As when a knight fyghteth for his right / and for the right sleeth his
aduersarye. To slay any man in to y^ first manners / yt is to say / for hate /
wrath / and enmyte / or for false couetyse is always unlawful But for to slay a
man the third manner and the fourth / that is to say by process of law with
a lawful Judge or by law of arms by the hands of knights or of men of arms
ruled by y^ law of god it is lefull when men be gylty. And therefore saint
Austen says lt.i.de li. arbitreo. If it be so yt the knight slay his
aduersarye in ryghtfull batayil / or the Judge and his of fycers slay him yt is
worthy to dye / me thinks they sin not. But leave friend three thyngis be
nedeful / so that manslaughter should be leful and right full. First that the
case by ryghtfull order and process of law / and yt the Justice have lawful
power to slay / and yt he that shall be slain be conuycte of his trespace.
Also the Intenco^n of the Judge and of the pursuers and of the officers be
ryghtfull yt they slay him in salua^yon of the right / and for saluaco^n and
ensample of other / not for liking of vengeance ne of cruelte not having
liking in his pain / so that the cause be ryghtfull and the order and
process and the entenco^n be ryghtfull. Iusta causa. iustus ordo. iustus
animus. Dives. Contra te. Yet the gospel says. Quoth deus ^iunxit ho^ no^
seperet Met^.ix. The^e should no man depart thing that god has knyt
togydre. But god has knyt the soul and the body togydre / therefore than it
is not lefull to any man for to depart y^ soul from the body neither to slay
man ne woman. Pauper. When the man that is gylty is slain ryghtfully by y^ law
/ man sleeth him not / but as gods mynysters and gods officers. For y^ law
of god and god himself slay him in that yt god commands such to be slain.
God is pryncypall Judge of this death / and man is but gods offycer to do his
bidding And therefore says the law that they yt slay men ryghtfully be not
called mansleers. For why says he the law sleeth them not they.xxij.q^.v. si

Dives. Sythen it is so that trespasors lawfully may be slain by the byddyng
of god why may not prelates of holy church and mynystres of the altar slay
such trespasors / ne sytte in y^ dome of man's death / ne give the sentence /
ne give assystence to y^ domesman sith in the old law prestes and mynystres
of the altar might lawfully slay trespasors as we find in many places of holy
wryt. Exo.xxxij.de Leuit et Numeri. xxij de Phinees.l.regu^.xv.de Samuele ^
in^fecit Agag. Et.iij.regu^.xviij.de Helia qui interfecit sacerdotes Baal
Pauper. As the law says.xxiij.q^ viij.occidit. Much thing was lefull in y^
old law yt is not leful in ye new law. In the old law y^ sword was
granted to prestes and mynystres of gods altar. In the new law god for
byddeth them the sword / when he said to Peter in time of his passion anon
as he had betaken him power to make the sacrament of the altar. Convert
gladiu^ tuu^ in vagina^ and^. Turn thy sword in to the shethe / for he yt
smite with the sword / shall perysshe with y^ sword. In such words god
forbydeth y^ sword to all the mynystres of gods altar / as y^ law
says.xxiij.q^.viij.de cplis cu^ alijs capls seque^tibus. Dives. Why forbadde
he them the swerd. Pauper. For god would yt men of holy church should be men
of peace / of mercy / of pity. And therefore he said to them. Discite a me quia
mitis sum et hu^ilis cord. Learn ye of me / for I am low and meke of heart.
Mat^.xi. He bad them not learn to play with the sword / ne with the staff /
ne learn to fight and shote to slay there enemies / but he bad them learn to be
low and meke of heart and to live in pacyence as lambs among wolves. And he
badde them love there enemies and do good to them that hate them. Mat^.v. He
had them show pacyence peace and pity / not only in word will and deed but he
bad them absteyne them from all tokenes of vnpacyence of vnpeas and of
crueltee. And for that sheddynge of blood and manslaughter is often token of
vnpacyence and vnpeas of wrath and of cruelte in them that sleen and dysposeth
them to crueltee. Therefore christ forbadde the sword to all the mynystres of
the altar. Dives. Tell me some other reason. Pauper. An other reason is this.
For the sacrament of the altar that the prestes make by the virtue of crystus
word is a sacrament of charity and of onehede. For it represents the onehede
that is between christ and holy church. And also it represents the onehede
of the soul with the body. For as the soul quyckeneth the body / so christ
by y^ sacrament of the altar quyckeneth holy church and man's soul. Also it
represents y^ onehede of y^ godhede with our manhede in christ / and therefore
holy church says thus. Nam sicut ai^a racionalis et cato vnus est ho^.ita
deus et ho^ vnus est x^s. Right as reasonable soul and the flesh is one man
/ so god and the man is one christ / and one christ is both god and man. And
therefore he that destroys the onehede of the soul with the body and
departs them atweyne by manslaughter / he shows not in himself ne in his
deed the sacrament of onehede of christ with holy church and of the godhede
with the manhede in christ. But he does against that sacrament by speracyon and
dyuysyon that he makes in manslaughter and sheddynge of blood. And therefore he
is yrreguler and unable to make the sacrament of the altar. And for the same
reason if a man have wedded two wives and so departs his flesh in dyuer s;e
wymen / he is yrreguler and unable to the altar. And therefore not only prestes
/ but dekenes and subdekenes in that they be astent to the priest in making of
the sacrament must be without such departing that is contrary to the
sacrament of endeles charity and of onehede between god and holy church and
between all good christian people y^ is in charity for all they be one and come
togydre in this sacrament For this reason it is not leful to men of holy church
to shed man's blood / ne to slay ne to mayme. The new testament is a law of
love / and therefore christ would yt the mynystres of the auter in ye new
testament that should mynystre the sacrament of his endeles love and of his
endless mercy to mankind / that they show love / mercy and pity / and no token
of cruelte. The old testament was a law of dread and duresse / and nygh all
the sacrefyces that the prestes made was done with shedynge of blood / not only
in figure of crystus passion / but also in token yt he yt sinned was worthy to
be slain as the beast that was slain / that was offered for his sin. And
therefore the sword was granted to prestes and to the mynystres of the old
law to punysshe rebellours when it needs / and much of their office was to
shed blood. And so by their office they were dysposed to crueltee. In so
much that they were not afrede to flee gods sone there lord / there sovereign
/ and there god. And for that prestes of the old law by cruelte slough christ
god and lord of all. Therefore shedynge of blood and manslaughter is forboden
to prestes in the new law and makes them unable to the aultre that shed
man's blood or help thereto.

SHeddynge of blood in men of holy church is so abhomynable and horrible in

it / and the need came not by his defaute holy church suffers him in the
ordres that he has taken to mynystre therein / but he shall take none higher

his occupacyon was lefull or not lefull / if he did not his business to flee

his besynes to flee manslaughter though he saw not before all chau^ges yt

thing to let woman yt she may not conceive ne bring forth childern. And if y^
woman wylfully take such drynkes or do any mys craft to let hyrself or any

Dives. Say forth what thou wylt. Pauper. Prelates of holy church may not

the faith and for the truth of gods law and of holy church / and though
men be slain thereby / they be not yrreguler / as the law shows

If a clerk plain him to y^ Justice on him yt robbod of his good only to have
again his good and not to pursue his death / though the Justice slay y^ thief the
clerk is not yrreguler. Ex.e.postu lasti and^.tua nos. S.ad vltimu^. If a
clerk help to take a thief or to bind him to lead him to the Justice / or

thieves / if it were semely to him yt manslaught^ should follow thereof he is
yrreguler if any man be slain there by. But if he hope thereby only to have again
his good without manslaughter / he is not yrreguler though manslaughter
follows thereof. Clerks may bear wepen when they pass by peryllouse places to
afere thieves / but they ought not to smite. If a clerk leave any man bow
arblast or any other wepen to fight with / if any man be slain therewith or
maimed yt clerk is yrreguler. If a clerk err in answering and by his mys
answer followed manslaughter / if the clerk be hold a wise man he is
yrreguler And though he be but simple lettred and he err so in such things
yt he ought to know / and manslaughter come of his mys answer / he is
yrreguler. As if a clerk say that it is le full to slay a thief / and to slay
lecherors or to rise against there souerayns or slay them / if men follow his
counseyll and slay / he is yrreguler. If a clerk bydmen stop the thieves
mouth that he cry not so to lead him the more slyly and the more sekerly to
his Judge / if he be slain / the clerk is yrreguler. If men pursue a thief or
any other man to take him / and they ask a clerk if he saw any such / if he
teache them or wysse them wetynge or supposing that they seek him for to
disease him / if yt man be slain the clerk is yrreguler / but if he have no
fantasye why they seek him but good / he is not yrreguler. Though a man slay

Also if he counseyll men to take a castle to cast engyne to a town / or to a

any man be slain thereby he is yrreguler. If any man counseyll another man to
go and slay and he be slain himself / he that gave that counseyll is
yrreguler. Though priest or clerk counsel men to fight for salvation of the
contre and of the faith / so that he bid they not slay / he is not yrreguler
though they slay and he bid them put himself to the death for saluaco^n of the
contre and for the truth. If any man would flee his enemies / and another man
counsel him not to flee / and he upon that he trust and abides and is
slain / he that gave him that counsel is yrreguler. But he were in hope to
have saved his life and that he might have saved his life / or by power or by
frenshyp / and in trust thereof did him abide than he is not yrreguler. But if
he presumed to much on himself / or was retcheles in kekynge or gylous / than
is he yrreguler If any man in need slay his aduersarye to save his own life /
if he may not else well save himself / he synneth not / so yt his need come not

Dives. Me meruayleth much why sheddynge of blood and the sword is so
straytly forboden to men of holy church. For as we read in the gospel. Christ
bad his dyscyples selle their clothes and bye them swerdes / when he said. Qui
non habet vendat tunicam sua^. et emat gladium. Luce.xxij. He that has no
sword selle his cote and bye him a sword. Pauper. Christ said tho words not
to all his apostles / but to Judas the traytoure not bidding him bye him a
sword / but so showing and saying before the wicked will and the wicked
purpose that Judas was in to beg a sword to come for to betray christ and to
take him that when the Jews came with swerdes and staves to take him as the
gospel says / he should have his sword redye to defend himself if any of
crystus dyscyples would smite him. And therefore christ said not tho words in
the plurell nombre / as to many but in the synguler / as to one Judas alone.
For he only was in purpose to betray him / and to beg him a sword for dread
of knockes. And by tho words christ bad him not beg a sword / but by the
words he vndern^ him of his malice / in such manner y^ only Judas should
understand it and none other of the apostles. For christ would not publysshe
either discure hy^ to y^ apostles / but only vndernam hy^ in such speech that
only Judas should wit that christ knew his wicked purpose and would not
dyscure him And so he showed goodness against his malice to styre him to
repentance. Dives. Why answerde than the apostles and said. Domie ecce duo
gladij hic. Lord lo two swerdes here redye. And our lord said. Satis est. It
suffyseth / it is enough. Pauper. For as I said. The appostles understood not
why ne to whom christ said tho words. And therefore they wend as much folk
weneth yet yt christ had bode them have bought swerdes for to fight. And
therefore they answered in that manner / and began to speak of swerdes and of
fighting. And than christ was dyspleased with there speech and badde them be
stylle of such speech. Satis est. It is enough / it suffyseth yt ye have
spoken in this manner speech / now no more of this matter. And therefore as Luke
says in the same place / they cessed of there speech anon and went with christ
in to y^ moute of Olyuete. On the same manner god said to Moses as he prayed
him yt he might enter the land of byhestes. Sufficit tibi. It is enough to the
that you haste said / speak no more to me of this matter. Deu. iij. Also god said
to the angel that slough the people. Sufficit. contine manum tuam. It is
enough withholde thy hand. And christ said to his dyscyples in time of his
passion when he found them slepynge. Sufficit It is enough that ye have slept
now / awake ye. And as he made an end of her slepynge. By this word sufficit
/ it suffyseth / so he made an end of their vnkunnynge speech when they began
to speak of swerdes by this word. Satis est. It is enough / that is to say /
ye have spoke enough in this matter / no more thereof For they wyste not what
christ meant no more than they wyste what crystement when he said to Judas. Quod
facis fac cicius. That thou do do it anon. In such words christ vndnam
Judas of his evil purpose yt he should amend him. And yet it is a custom with
much foke when they here their childern or servants speak unwisely to put
them to silence and do them be stylle with the same word / and say / sone it
is enough / thou haste said enough. Dives. And many clerks say / that when
the apostles said / loo here two swerdes / and christ said again Satis est. It
is enough. In tho words christ granted men of holy church two swerdes /
both ghoostely sword and bodily sword. Pauper. They err as the apostles
did. For they understood not why ne to whom christ said tho words. For christ
granted never too clerks the bodily sword to shed blood but he forbad it
to them in the same time when he vndernam Peter smiting with the sword and
badde him put it up his sword in to the shethe. For why says he / who that
smyteth with the sword / he shall perysshe with the sword. And so all the
process of the gospel if men understood it well / shows that christ has
forboden men of holy church y^ bodily sword. And therefore as saint Ambrose
says / there armuer and their fighting should be bitter teeres and holy
prayers. Dives Yet contra te. Christ says in the gospel. Non veni pace^
mittere. sed gladiu^. I came not says he to send peace in earth / but y^ sword
Math.x. Pauper By the sword in yt place is understand the sword of gods
word as y^ gloss says. By such sword man is departed from sin and from
wicked company / as the gospel shows well there. And by this sword sin is
slain in manes soul. Dives Sythen god forbad men of holy church the sword
and sheddynge of blood and manslaughter / why slough saint Peter Ananyam and
Sapharya^ his wife for her false couetouse and for her lesynges. Actuu^.v.
Pauper As the law says.xxiij.q^.viij.Petrus. He slough them not with
materyall sword / but only by power that god give him to do miracles / with
his prayers he raised a woman from death to life / whose name was Tabyta
Actuu^.ix. And with words of his blaming he took her life from Ananyam and
Saphyram. He prayed not for her death / but only vndername them for there sin
/ and anon they feldowne deed by the virtue of the sword of gods word that
Peter spoke and the holy ghost by Peter. For as saint Poule says / the sword
of gods word full often departs y^ soul from the body. And therefore the
word and the cursynge and vndernemynge of holy men and of men of holy church
is much for to dread. Or cllys by suffraunce of god. Anon as saint Pater
vndernam them / for they repented them not / y^ fend Sathanas took power over
them and slough them bodily / as he slough them first goostely by the sin of
false couetyse.

Dives. Is it lefull in any caas to slay any man or woman unguilty. Pauper. In
no caas as the law says openly.xx.q^.v. si no^. Dives I suppose that the
queste dampneth a man that the Justice knows unguilty / shall not y^ Justice
give the sentence and dampne him sythen the queste says that he is gylty.
Pauper God forbede For than falls the Justice in manslaughter. For he may by
no law slay him that he knows unguilty.xxiij.q^.v.si non. Dives. What shall
he do than. Pauper. If he have no Judge above him / he shall save him by his
plain power. And if he have a Judge above him / he shall send the man to him
and tell hy^ all the ^aas yt he may of his plain power deliver him and save him
from y^ death / or ellis seek some other way for to save him. But he shall not
give the sentence of his death. Pylate trauayled full besely to save christ from
death for that he wyste him unguilty / much more a christian Judge ought to
travail to save the Innocents life whom christ bought with his blood / and
flee false sentence. Pylate might and ought by law have saved christ. But for
to please the people and for dread yt they should have accused him to the
Emperor he followed there will and put christ to the death / and therefore
afterward he was dampened. For the false queste Pylate would not have dampened
him in that yt he wist him unguilty / but only for dread and to please the
people he dampened him. And sythen hethen law sledth no man unguilty much more
christian law shall slay no man unguilty. But the Judge shall do all his besynes to
flee sheddynge of blood without gylte. Therefore he is made Judge to descuse ye
truth to save the unguilty / and to punysshe the gylty and to let malice /
folly and falsehode of the questes and of the false witnesses. Therefore god says
thus to every Judge / thou shall not take the voice of lesynges / ne thou shall
not Joy ne thyn hand to say falls witness for the wicked man. That is to
say / thou shall make no covenant to say falls witness ne assent thereto Thou
shall not follow the peoples will to do any evil thing or any falsenes in
dome. Thou shall not assent to the sentence of many to go away from the
truth. Exo.xxiij. Therefore the law byddeth that the Justice be not to light
ne to ready to leave / ne to ready to take vengeance. Di.lxxxvi. si quid.
Et.xi.q^.vi.iij.quamuis.Et.xvi.q^.viij. Si quid. The end of every dome shall
be iusticia / yt is ryghtwysnes in english. And ryghtwysnesse is a virtue and
a steadfast will always to yeloe every man and woman his right Extra de ver.
significacione ca. forum. in glosa. And therefore when the Justice does wrong
in his sentence gyuynge / that is no ryghtfull dome / for it ends not in
ryghtwysnesse. But more wrong may he not do to man or woman than rob him of
his life and slay him without gylte. Therefore than what Judge sleeth man or woman
unguilty wytytngly he is no Judge / but he is a tyrau^t / and does against all
laws which be ordained to do right to every man to punysshe the gylty and to
save the unguilty. And therefore says the law that he is no Judge if
ryghtwysnesse be not in him Non est iudex si non est in eo iusticia.

Dives. Is it leful to any man or woman in any case to slay themself. Pauper.
In no case / and yt for many reasons. First for by way of kind every man
loves hy^self and is besy to save hy^self and to with stand al thing that
would destroy him. And therefore it is sin against al kind man or woman to
slay himself. Also it is against charity for each man is bound to love
himself and his even christian as himself. Also he does wrong to the comonte
of mankind. For as the phylosophre says. v^o ethicorum. Every man is a part
of the comonte / as every member is a part of the body. Also for man's life
is an high gift of god given to man to serve god. And only god may take it
away when he will. And therefore he that sleeth himself / he synneth against his
god in that that he sleeth his servant against his will / for though god give
a man auctoryte to slay an other man for his mysdede / yet god gives no man
auctoryte to slay him self. And therefore says the law. xxiij.q^.v.non licet.
That no man ne woman should slay himself / neither to flee myschyfe of this
world ne to flee other men's sin / ne for sorrow of his one sin yt he
has done / ne for to go the sooner to heaven. For if he slay himself as the
law says there / he gooth to endelesse myscheef. And he falls in over
grievous sin. And in that yt he sleeth himself he falls in wanehope and
does despyte to the mercy of god as Judas did. For after his death he may not
amend him of yt grievous sin of manslaughter. And by yt manslaughter he
sleeth his life in this world and his life in heaven bliss / and gooth to the
death in hell without end. And therefore there should no woman slay hyrselfe to
save her chastyte that she be not defouled. For if she be defouled by vyo ence
against her will / she synneth not For as saint Lucye says to y^ tyrau^t
Pascasius / the body is not defouled but by assent of the soul. But ye sin
is in him that so defouleth her. And less sin it is to fall in lechery than
man or woman to slay himself for there is no help after. Ne there should no
man ne woman slay himself ne mayme himself for dread yt he should consent to
sin / but trust in god yt may keep him from consenting and let occasyons
of sin. And though man or woman be constrained to sin for dread of death /
better it is and a fayrer yt an other slay him / than he slay himself for yt is
dampened in every law. Dives. Contra te. Sampson and diverse other slough the^
self as we read in holy wryt. Paupro As saint Austen says de ciuitate dei They
slough themself by the preuy counsel of the holy ghost yt would by there death
do miracles. As when that Sampson took the two pylers of the paynyms temple
which bare up all the temple and shook them to gydre with his arms till they
brosten and the temple fell down and slough many thousands of the hethen
people that was gadred to wondre on Sampson in despyte of god of heaven whose
servant Sampson was.

Caplm.xxiij.
Dives. Whether is it more sin to slay the ryghtfull man or the wicked man.
Pauper. It is more sin to slay the ryghtfull man / for in yt the sleer noyeth
most him whom he ought more to love. Also for he does wrong to him that have
not deserved it and more against ryghtwysnesse. Also for he pryueth and robs
the comonte of manhood of a great Jewel. For every good man and good woman is
a well to the comonte of mankind. Also for he does more despyte to god for
to all good christ says. Qui vos spernit. me spernit. Who despyseth you
despyseth me. Dives. Contra. If a good man be slain he shall soon go to heaven /
But the wicked man if he be slain unwarily / he shall goo to hell. And less
sin it is to send by sleynge a man to heaven than to hell Pauper. Saint Poul
says.i. ad little iij. That every man and woman shall take his own mede after
yt his trauayll is. Therefore the good man so slain shall go to heaven for his
good deeds / not for y^ malice of the sleer. And the wicked man so slain shall
goo ^o hell for his own wicked deeds / not for the wicked deeds of the sleer.
And the sleer shall goo to hell both for the sleynge of the good and of the
wicked. But he shall be depper in hell for sleynge of the good than of the
wicked. For he shows more malice and more aggreueth god and all the court of
heaven in sleynge of the good than of y^ wicked. And he shall answer for all
the good deeds that the good man should have do if he had lived longer. And he
shall be puny s;shed for the sleynge of the wicked man / for that yt he sleeth
him against gods law and lets him yt he may have no time to amend him.
Dives Is it lefull to any man to slay his wife if he take her in auoutre Pauper
To slay her by law cyuyle there laws ordeyne man and woman that done auoutre
to be slain. It is lefull so that he do it only for love of right wysnesse and
of clennesse / not for hate ne for to be avenged on her. And let him well
charge his conscience / if he be ought gylty in the same / either in will or in
deed / and take heed to his own freelte and think yt the law is as well
ordained to punysshe him if he do amys as to punysshe the woman. But any man to
slay his wit by his own auctoryte or do her be slain without lawful Judge it
is not lefull by all gods law. And though any lands law give men leave to
slay there wives in any caas / holy church shall punysshe them and enjoin
them full hard penance as for mauslaughter. Dives. Whether is more sin a
man to slay his wife or to slay his fader or mother. Pauper. Both be grievous
sins and much against kind. For the man and his wife be one flesh and one
blood. And he ought as saint Poule says to love his wife as his own body /
and therefore he to slay her against kind. But yet it is more sin and more
against kind to slay fader and mother / for of them man has his beginning his
flesh and blood. And also if he slay any of them he forfeteth openly against
the commandment of god the fourth and the fyfthe. For in that he
vnworshyppeth over much his fader and his moth and falls in cruel
ma^slaughter / and therefore it is more sin to slay fader and mother than to
slay his wife / as the law says in su^ma ^ffessorum li. iiij.ti.ix.q^.x.

Caplm.xxiiij.
Dives. Sythen god byddeth that no man should slay vnryghtfully. Why suffers
god so much war be in earth / and so many batayles. Pauper. For much folk
is worthy to deye and will not stand to the law of peace. Therefore god has
ordained and commanded the law of y^ sword and of cheualrye to bring them
to peace with the sword y^ will not obey the peace by law of charity and
reason. Dives. Than it seems y^ men of arms may slay menlefully that will not
obey to the peace and to gods will. Pauper. That is soth. For Abraam Moses
Iosue Dauyd Iosye Machabeis and many other were men of arms and sloughe much
folk. And yet god repreued them not but he bad them slay and halpe them in
there sleynge and in there fighting. Dives. I may well assent that battle is
lefull if it be ryghtful. For god is called. Dn^s exercituu^ et dn^s labaoth.
That is to say / lord god of oostes. Pauper. Three things be nedeful that
batayl be ryghtfull. Iusta causa. iustus ammus. et auctoritas legittimus
principis. A ryghtfull cause / a ryghtfull Intencyon / and auctoryte of a
lawful prince. First it is needful that the cause be ryghtfull that they
fight only for the right and to mayntene right / and for saluaco^n of the
comonte and of them that be un gylty and would have peace. For as saint Austen
says. The end of battle should be peace.xxiij.q^.i. nolite. Also there
Intencyon must be ryghtfull that they fight not for pride to get them a name
/ ne for no false couety s;e to get worldely good / ne for no malice for to be
venged / ne for no cruelte and liking to shed blood. For if there Intencyon
be wicked / thongh there cause be true / they sin in ma^slaughter. And for
there wicked Intencyon god suffers men to be ouercomen in a ryghtfull cause.
Also it must be do by auctoryte of a lawful prince / that is prince made by
common custom / or by common law / or by common assent of the comonte / or by
common lawful eleccyon. For though a person gadre to him rebellors against his
liege lords will / all though the rebellors make him there head and her prince /
they may not by his auctoryte do ryghtfull batayl. But all though au^toryte of
a pry^ce lawful be needful to ryghtfull battle that is solempny done by
man's law / yet in a ryghtfull cause at need man may by law of kind without
auctoryte of any prince fight and defend hy^self and his goods against wicked
folk / for it is the law of kind every man to save himself and put away
fors with fors / and might with might. Licitu^ est vim vt repellere. So yt his
purpose be not to slay ne to rebel against his soue rain ne against the law /
but only in truth to save him and his fro wicked doers. Nethelesse clerks
should not fight for no worldely good / but they may in case with fighting
and smytyng defend there own person ayenste clerk and ^wde man. And so may
the lewd man defend himself with smiting against the clerk y^ seeks to
smite hy^ if he may not else sekerly save himself / and if he may sekerly save
hy^self / either by slyght / either by shettynge of door or of gate or any
other way / he ought to save himself and not smite a clerk / but wisely save
them both. But always be he ware that his flight be not cause of his death. And
sith yt the lewd man ought to flee the clerk if he may in seker manner save
them both. Much more the clerk yt should show pacyence and flee shedynge of
blood / by his order ought to flee a lewd man if he may to save himself
sekerly and to save them both. If the sugett be in doubt whether the cause yt
they fight for be true they be excused by the commandment of there prince for
virtue of obedpence / so that the sugettes have no cause to mysdeme of her
prince by his common living / but y^ they suppose that he in all his living be
ruled by reason and gods law. But if they be seker that the cause is false /
they be not excused ne ought not to fight. Or else if the prince be man out of
good gouernau ce as frentyke or braynles / or else that he be in his living
openly rebellynge ayest god / than the people ought not to obey to his
bidding when he byddeth them fight / but if they know sekerly that his cause
be true. But than they must obey the prince of heaven that byddeth them slay
no man ne woman unguilty. Sowdeours and other knights and men of arms and
other friends of the prince not suget to him by obedyence / if they fight for
him in cause that is in doubt / they be not excused from dedely sin and man
slaughter. In su^ma ^fesso.li.ij.i.v.q^.xlv.et.xlvi. Thus leave friend have I
declared to you the fyfthe byheste that byddeth you and us all not slay. And
therefore leave friend all if your person be not able to fight ne to slay / yet
I pray you yt ye beware yt ye assent to no man's death neither before ne after
/ but ye were seker that they were gylty and worthy to deye. For the law says
/ that both they that done the mysdede and they that assentten thereto be worthy
even pain. Agentes et consencientes pari pena puniantur. Iustefye ye no
man's death / but ye know well the cause of his death. For I am seker that god
dampneth much manslaughter that ye and other Iustefye, and the dome of god
shall fall that he said to saint Peter. He that smyteth with y^ sword shall
perysshe with the sword. And he that robs shall be robs. Ve ^ predaris
nonne predaberis Ysa.xxxiij. Aldaye ye may see what vengeance falls for
shedynge of man's blood every year more and more Other necyons slay us in
every side / and rob us / and we have little speed or none but only to slay
our own naco^n Therefore be ye ware of gods sword and of man's sword also
/ and Iustefye ye not that god dampneth.

Here ends the fyfthe commandment. And begins the sixthe. Capitulum
Primu^.
Dives. Thy counsel is good. God send us peace and keep us fro y^ sword. Now
I pray the declare me y^ sixth commandment Pauper. The sixth commandment is
this. Non mechaberis. That is to say in English. Thou shall do no lecherye /
ne meddle with no thing flesshely but only with thy lawful wife. As the gloss
says. And so by this commandment he forbydeth all spyces of lethery. Dives.
How many spyces of lechery be there. Pauper. Nine. And these be they.
Fornycacyon and lecherye with common wymen / auoutry defoulynge of maydenhode /
defoulynge of chastyte auowed to god / defoulyng of them that be nyghe of kynne
of affynyte or of gossyprede and sodomye that is mysuse of man's body or
woman's in lecherye against kind and pollucyon of man's body or woman's by there
own sterynge and by themself which is a full horrible sin. And also synful
medlynge togydre between husbonde and wife. Formcaciomeretriciu^. adulterium.
Stup^u^. sacrilegiu. incestus. peccatu^ sodomiticu^ voluntaria in se pollucio
et per se prouocat. et libidinosus coitus piugalis. Dives. In how many ways
may the husbonde sin medlynge with his wife. Pauper. In.viij. ways. First
if he meddle with her only to fulfill his lusts and his lecherye taking no
head to god ne to y^ honest of matrymonye. Also if he pass mesure in his
doing. Also if he meddle with her in times which holy church cou^seyled men
to co^tynence / as in holy times and in time of lent / in time of fasting /
and of other prayer / which times he may meddle with her so bodily against
reverence of the time and of god that he shall sin dedely. For Peter and
Poule teache yt wedded folk should in holy time and in time of prayer absteyne
them fro such lusts yt there prayer may the more gracyously be herd of god
and there heart y^ more given to god For such lust as for the time draws
man's heart and womannes much fro god / and makes them fulfle s;shely and
the less goostly. Therefore as we read Gen^.vij. In the time of the flood in
Noes time for the herd trybulacyon and dredther they were in all that year.
Noe and his three sons kept them chaste and lay by themself and there wives by
themself / so that by holy prayers and contynence they might y^ sooner be
delivered of that peril and myscheef that they were in. Also if he meddled with
his wife in holy place without need. For in time of werre though he meddle with
his wife in church if he dare not lie out of y^ church for dread of his
enemies he is excused and the church is not pollute / or else it were
pollute. And also if he meddle with his wife when she is great with child
nyghe the time of birth. For than lightly he might slay the child. Also if
they meddle togydre with evil condyco^n. Also if he meddle with his wife
wetyngly in her common sekenes at his own proufre. But if husbonde and wife
meddle to gydre flesshely without these defauct only to bring forth a vein to
the heart / and get childern to gods service else to flee fornycacyon and
lecherye on other half / or to yield the debt of there body each to other
than they sin not. But than as saint Poule says there wedloke is worshypfull
/ and there bed without spot of blame. Honorabile connubiu^ in oi^buset thorus
i^maculatus. Ad hebre.xiij. Upon which word says the great clerk Haymo and
the gloss also. That it is a worshypfull wedloke when a man weddeth his wife
lawfully to bring forth childern to gods service / and absteyneth him fro
his wife in due time. And than is there bed without spot of blame when he
meddle with his wife lawfully and for a good end keep mesure and manner / than
rise they up out of bed without spot of blame.

Caplm.ij.
QAtrymonye was ordained of god for two causes. First p^y^cypaly in to office
to bring forth childern to gods service. Also in to remedy to flee
fornycaco^n and lecherye For the first cause it was ordained in paradyse
before Adams sin. For y^ second cause it was ordained out of paradyse after
Adams sin. Three good things be pryncypaly in matrymouye. The first is faith
yt each of them keep truly his body to other / and meddle flesshely with none
other. The second is bryngyng forth and nourysshynge of children to y^ worship
of god and to gods service For else it were better that they were unborn.
The third is y^ sacrament which may not be undo but only by death. And
therefore the order of wedloke is full worshypfull / for it represents y^
great sacrament of unity and of endless love between y^ godhede and the manhede
in christ very god and very man and between christ and holy church and between
christ and christian soul. And the faithful love yt ought to be between
husbonde and wife betokens the love and the faith yt ought to be between
christ and christian soul and between christ and holy church. For the husbonde
should love his wife with true love. And therefore when he weddeth her / he
sets a ring on her finger which ring is a token of true love that ought
to be between them. For they must love them togydre hertely and therefore it is
set in the fourth finger For as clerks say fro yt finger god gives her but
one ring in token that they should love theymsyngulerly togydre. For as against
comynynge of the body / the husbonde should love his wife and none other / and
the wife her husbonde and none other. The ring is round about and has none
end in token yt there love should be endeles / and no thing depart them but
death alone. Also the ring is made of gold or of silver in token that as gold
and silver passes all other metals in value and clennesse / so should there
love pass al other loves. And the husbonde love his wife passing all other
wymen / and the wife love her husbonde passing all other men And as gold and
silver passes all other metals in clennes / so should there love al be set in
clennes and not common togydre / but for bringing forth of childern or to flee
fornycaco^n or to yield the debt of there bodies. This love betokens the love
yt we owe to god that is our goostly husbonde to whom we be all wedded in onr
baptem. For we should love him hertely with all our heart syngulerly / with all
our soul lastyngly / with all our mind myghtely / and with all our myghtes
And therefore says he Deutronous.vi. Thou shall love thy lord god with all thy
heart / with all thy soul / with all thy mind / and with all thy might The
husbonde betokens christ / the wife betokens holy church and christian soul
which is gods spouse and ought to be suget to christ as wife to husbonde.
Three ornament long pry^cypaly to a wife. A ring on her finger / a broche on
her breast / and a garlonde on her head The ring betokens true love as I
have said / the broche be tokeneth clennesse in heart and chastyte that she
ought to have / the garlonde betokens gladness and the dygnyte of the
sacrament of wedloke. For the husbonde betokens christ / and the wife holy
church which is called queen and gods spouse. And therefore saint Poule says
thus. Vi^i diligite vxores vestras. Ye men love ye your wives as christ loved
holy church / and put himself to the death for holy church. so should men do
if it neded for there wives as the gloss says. Men says he ought to love there
wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife he loves himself. Sythen
than this sacrament of wedloke is so great and so worshypfull in christ and
holy church / therefore every man love his wife as himself. And the wife love
her husbonde and dread him / Wymen says he must be suget to there husbondes as
to there lord. For man is head of woman / as christ is he^e of holy church.
And as all holy church is suget to christ / so must wymen be sugett to there
husbo^des These be y^ words of saint Poul. Ad ephesians.v.

Caplm.iij.
SYthen that the order of wedlok is so great and so worshypfull in christ and
holy church / as saint Poule says without doubt they that break it or mysuse
it in lust and liking of the flesh and follow only there lust as bestes and
refreyne not themself by reason and by gods law / they sin full
grievously. Therefore we find in holy writ. Thobie.vi. That there was a woman
that hight Sara and she was wedded to seven husbondes / and a devil that hight
Asmodeus slough them all each after other the first night or yt they meddled With
her For they wedded her more for bre^ny^ge lust of ye flesh / than for any
true cause of matrymonye. After the angel Raphaell came to ye young Tobye and
said to him yt he should wedde Sara Than young Tobye said to ye angel I have
herd he said yt the devil has power over al men yt wedde her and sleeth
them. Than ye angel said to hy^. I shall tell ye over which men the fend
has power / over them yt so take wedloke yt they put god from them and fro
there mind and give tente to flesshely lusts / as horse and mule yt have no
understanding / over them the devil has power. But thou shall not take her
in such a manner / but threnyghtes ye shall keep you chaste and give you to
holy prayers / and than thou shall take thy wife with the dread of god
pryncypaly to bring forth childern to the worship of god. Sythen than the
devil has such power over them that so mysuse there wives and the order of
wedloke. Much more power has he over them yt break the order of wedloke and
take other than there wives. Therefore god badde in the old law Deut^.xxij.
That if any man meddled with an other man's wife / they should be slain both ye
man and ye woman. And the wife man says that he yt does auoutrye for myscheef
of heart he shall lose his soul / and he gadreth shame and shenshyp to himself
/ and his shame shall never be do away Prouer.vi. And there he says that
although theeft be a grievous sin / yet in regard of auoutre it is but a small
sin. And so says the grete^clerke Bid and the gloss also. Many myscheues
fall to them yt live in auoutrye much sickness much myshappe loss of good
/ vanysshynge of catell / and little foyson therein / sodayn pouerte evil name
and much shame / great hurt / and often maymynge and myscheuous death / as
death in prison and hanging and often sudden death / and Instruccyon of heirs
and of their herptage. And therefore the wise man says Filij adulterorum and^.
The childern of them yt live in auoutrye shall soon be at an end / and the
issue and the sede that comes of the wicked bed shall be destroyed / and
though they live long they shall not be set by / and their last age shall be
without worship Naciones in^que dire sunt consummacionis They that be mysborn
most commonly they have an hard end. Sap^.iij. And as he says in the next
chaptre following. Childeren borne in auoutrye shall give no deperotes / ne
set no stable ground / but tehy shall always be in tempest of trybula cyon.
Their branches shall break / and their rotes be plucked up. The fruit of
them shall be vnproufytable / and they shall be full bitter in every mete and
able to right naught. Sapi^e.iij. In token and confyrmacyon of this / we find
in the law / yt the holy pope Bonyface the third which was a martyr wrote to
y^ king of england in this manner / as it is told openly to the contrees /
and vpbreyded to us that be in france and Italye / and hethen men repreue us
thereof / that eng^ysshe people despise the laws of wedloke and give them to
auoutrye and lecherye as did the folk of Sodom But wit it well if it be so
as men say of them / the people that shall be borne of such lechery and
spouse breche shall be ungentle people and a repreue to all there kynrede. They
shall be wood in lecherye / and always the people shall come to worse and worse
/ and at the last be unable to battle / unstable in faith and without worship
and not beloved of god ne of man / as it falls to many other nacyons / for
they would not know gods law. Distinco^e.lvi. Si gens anglorum. Dives. It
seems that the prophecye of that pope is now fulfilled. For what auoutre has
reigned in this land many a years it is no counsel / and namely among
these lords which have now brought this land in bitter bales Some of them be
slain / some of them yet live in much woo. Gods law is foryete and
forboden that men should not know it ne have it in there mod tongue. The people
is unworthy and in despyte to al crystendom / for there falsehede and there false
byleuynge / and so wood in lecherye / that the brother is not ashamed to hold
openly his own sister. They be harlottes in living / unstable in faith /
unable to battle / ouercomen nyghe over all / hated of god and of man without
grace and speed nyghe in all there doing Pauper. Example to this we find in
the second book of kings.xij. ca. Where we find that when Dauyd had done
auoutre with Barsabee the wife of y^ noble knight Vrye and after that
treccherously that knight slain / god sent the prophet Nathan to Dauyd and
repreued him of his sin and said / that sword and debate should never pass
fro his household and fro his kynrede. I shall says god reyse myscheef and
disease against the of thine own many / and take thy wives and give them all
to thy next and he shall openly lie by thy wife. Thou do it preuely. I shall
punysshe the openly. And so it befell / for Absolon his own sone droffe him
out of his own kingdom and lay by his wife in the sight of all the people And
thereafter was never stabylyte in his kingdom. And yet the auoutrye of Dauyd
was more punysshed / for the child that was begoten in auoutrye dyed soon
after for the sin of the fader and of the mother. And afterward Aaman Dauydes
sone lay by Thamar his own sister and therefore Absolon her brother sloughe
Aaman his brother in treccherye And all these myscheues fell for Dauydes sin
with Barsabee. We find also in holy wryt. Iudicu^.xx. That for defoulynge of
one man's wife were slain three score thousand and five thousand. It is a
common proverb in latin. Deb^le fundamentu^ fallit opus. A feeble ground
desceyueth the work. For when the ground is feeble and false / the work that
is setttheron shall soon fail. But y^ ground and the beginning of every
people is lawful wedloke and lawful generaco^n in matrymonye. And if that
fail the people shall be unstable and unthrifty / and that god shows well in
the beginning of the world / for when men wedded unlawfully and brake the
bonds and the laws of wedloke which god ordained at the beginning. Than god
sent the great flood and destroyed all mankind save Noe and his wife and his
three sons and there wives.

Caplm.iiij.
Dives. When gaaf god laws of matrymonye and what laws gaaf he. Pauper. When
god had made Adam he put a great sleep in Adam / and in his sleep he took out
one of his rybbes and filled up the place with flesh / and of yt rybbe he
made Eve and brought her to Adam. Than Adam awoke and as god Inspyred him he
took the laws of wedloke and said thus. This bone is now of my bones / and
this flesh of my flesh For this thing man shall forsake fader and mother
and take him to his wife / and they shall be two in one flesh. Gen^.ij. In
which words / when he said that man for his wife should forsake fader and
mother and take him to his wife / he showed the sacrament of true love and unity
that ought to be between husbonde and wife. And by the same words he shows
what faith ought to be between them. For he shall take him to his wife and
meddle with her and with none other / and she with him and with none other. And
in that he said that they should be two in one flesh / he shows that they
should meddle togydre pryncypally to bring forth childern to gods worship.
For in there child husbonde and wife ben one flesh and one blood. Also in
that he said that the husbonde should cleue to his wife / he forbyddeth
fornycacyon and auoutrye. And that he said in the synguler nombre to his wife
and not to his wives / he forbyddeth bygamye that a man should not have two
wives to gydre / ne one woman two husbondes to gydre And in y^ he said that
they should be two in one flesh / he forbadde sodomye / and also by the same
words he shows that each of them has power over others body and none of
them may conteyne but by assent of them both. Dives. Why made god woman more of
the rybbe of Adam than of an other bone. Pauper. For the rybbe is next the
heart in token yt god made her to be man's fellow in love and his helper. And
as the rybbe is next the heart of all bones / so should the wife be next in
love of all wymen and of al men. God made not woman of the foot to be man's
thrall / ne he made her not of the head to be his master / but of his side and
of his rybbe to be his fellow in love and helper at need. But When Eve sinned /
than was woman made suget to man so yt the wife should be ruled by her husbond
and dread him and serve him as fellow in love and helper at need / and as next
solace in sorrow / not as thrall and bound in vyleyne seruage. For y^ husbonde
ought to have his wife in reverence and worship in yt they be both one flesh
and one blood. Dives. Why made not god woman by hyrselfe of the earth as he did
Adam. Pauper. For to increase there love to gydre / and also to give woman matter
of lowenesse. First for encreasynge of love / for in yt woman is part of
man's body / man must love her as his own flesh and blood. And also she
must love man as her beginning and as her flesh and her blood. Also she
ought to take great matter of lowness / and think that man is her perfeccyon
and her beginning and have man in reverence as her perfecco^n / as her
pryncypal / as her beginning and her first in order of kind. God made all
mankind of one / for he would that all mankind should be in one charity as
they came all of one.

Caplm.v.
Dives. Whether is auoutry gretter sin in the man or in the woman. Pauper.
Commonly it is more sin in the man. For the higher degree y^ harder is the
fall and the sin more grievous. Also man is more mighty by way of kind to
withstand and has more reason whereby he may withstand and beware of the
fendes gyle. And in that he is made master and governor of woman to govern
her in virtue and keep her fro vices. If he fall in vices and in auoutre more
than y^ woman he is much to blame and worthy to be repreued shamefully.
Therefore saint Austen in li. de december cordis. Vndernemeth husbondes yt fall in
auoutrye and says to each of them in this manner. God says to the you shall do
no lecherye yt is to say / you shall meddle with no woman but with the wife.
Thou axest this of thy wife that she meddle with none but with the. And therefore
thou ought to be before thy wife in virtue / you fallest down under the
fylthe of lecherye. Thou wylt yt thy wife be ouercomer of lecherye and have y^
maystrye of the fend / and you wylt be overcome as a cowarde and lie down in
lecherye And notwithstanding that thou art head of thy wife / yet thy wife go
before the to god / and thou that art head of thy wife ghost bacwarde to hell
Man says he is head of woman / and therefore in what household the woman lives
better than the man in y^ household hangs the head donewarde For sith man is
head of woman / he ought to live better than woman and go before his wife in
all good deeds / that she may sue her husbonde and follow her head. The head of
each household is the husbonde / and y^ wife is the body By course of kind
theder that the head ledeth thither should the body follow. Why would than the
head that is the husbonde go to lecherye and he will not that his body his wife
follow / why would the man go thyd wheder he will not that his wife follow /
and a little after in y^ same book saint Austen says thus Day by day
playntes be made of man's lecherye / al though there wives dare not plain them
of their husbondes. Lecherye of men is so bold and so customable y^ it is take
now for a law in so much yt me^ tell her wives yt lecherye and auoutry is
lefull to men but not to wymen / thus says saint Austen. Dives And sometime it
is herd yt wives be take lyeng with her servant and brought to court before y^
Judge with much shame but yt any husbo^de is so brought to court by fore yt Judge
for he lay with his wymen it is seldom seen. Pauper. And yet as saint Austen
says in y^ same book / it is as great sin in y^ man as in y^ wife and somdel
more. But forsooth says he it is not y^ truth of god but y^ shrewedne s;se of
man yt makes man less gylty than woman in yt same sin Men be not so often
take in auoutrye ne punysshed for auoutry as wymen be / for they be less gylty
/ but for yt they be more gylty and more mighty to maynten there sin / and
nygh each of them conforted other in his sin. Men be wytne s;ses Iuges and
doers to punysshe auoutrye in woman / and for they be ouerdone gylty in
auoutrye / therefore they travail nyghe all with one assent to may^ten their
lecherye. In woman is seldom seen auoutrye. And therefore it is full
sclaunderous when it falls and hard punysshed. But in men it is so common
that there is uneaths any sclaundre thereof / wymen dare not speak against the
lecherye of men / and men will not speak to repreue the lecherye of man / for
they be so much gylty. Sin that seldom falls is most sclaunderous / and
yet in case less grievous. And sin that often falls and is most in use is
less sclaunderous and yet it is most grievous. For the more customable and the
more bolder that men be in sin / and the less dread and shame that men have
to there sin / the more grievous is there sin. Therefore saint Austen in the
same place speaks more of this matter against the lecherye of men and says
thus. Peradventure thy wife hereth in the church by prechynge that it is not
leful to the to take any other but thy wife. She comes home and grutcheth
against thy lecherye and says to the that thou do things that is not lefull
/ for why we be both christian. The chastyre that thou axeste of me yield thou to
me. Iowe to the faith / and thou owe faith to me / and both we owe faith to
christ. Though thou desceyue me thou desceyuest not god whoos servants we be
both. Thou desceyue s;te not him that bought us both / for he knows all. But
wenest thou says saint Austen that the man will be heled and amend him with
her words. Nay nay says he / but anon he shall be wroth and he shall be wode
both with his wife and with the prechoure and curse the time that his wife came
to the church for to here the truth. These be the words of saint Austen in
the same book. And yet after in the same book he says thus. Peradventure thou
lechour wylt excuse the and say. I take none other man's wife / but I take
mine own servant. Wylt thou says he that thy wife say to the. I take none
other husbonde. I take but my servant. God forbede that thy wife should say so
to the. Better it is that she have sorrow of thy sin / than follow the or
take wicked exsample of the. Thy wife is chaste and an holy woman and a true
christian woman. She has sorrow of thy lecherye / not for the flesh but for
charity. And thy wife would that thou do not amys / not for that she does
not amys / but for it is not spedefull to the. For if she kept her chaste and
did not lecherye only for that you sholdest do no lecherye / if thou do
lecherye / she should do lecherye. But for yt the good woman keeps chastyte /
not only for the faith yt she ought to the / but also for the faith that she
ought to christ. For though the man do amys / yet the woman gives her chaste
to god Therefore says saint Austen in the same place. Christ speaks in the
hertes of good wymen within in their soul there there husbonde hereth it not /
for he is not worthy to here it and conforteth his daughter with such manner
words. Thou art evil dyseased with wrongs of thy husbonde / what has he do
to the. I pray y^ have pacyence be sorry of his mysdede / but follow him not to
do amys / but he must follow the in goodness. For in that that he does amys
let him not be thy head to lead the / but let thy god be thyn head. For if
thou follow him as an head in his shrewednesse / both head and body shall fall
down in to hell. And therefore might not the body yt is the wife follow the
wicked head / but might she hold her to the head of holy church that is
christ. To him the wife ought her chaste / to him pryncypaly she must do
worship / for he is pryncypal husbonde. Be her husbonde present be he absent /
the good woman shall always keep her chaste. For christ her husbo^de to whom
pryncypaly she ought her chaste is never absent. Change your life ye
letcherous men says saint Austen there / and fro thens forward be ye chaste /
ne say ye not that ye may not keep you chaste. For it is a shame to say that
man may not do that a woman does / ne be so chaste as a womas is. The woman
by right has as freell a flesh as y^ man. And woman was first desceyued of
the adder / your chaste wives show to you that ye may be chaste if ye will.
These be the words of saint Austen.

Caplm.vi.
Dives. Wymen may better be chaste than men / for they have much keeping upon
they^ The law byddeth them to chastyte. Their husbondes be besye to keep them
/ and hard laws be ordained to punysshe them if they de amys. Pauper. To
this answers saint Austen in the same book and says thus. Much keeping
makes woman chaste / and manhood should make man chaste. To woman is ordained
much keeping / for she is more freell / woman is ashamed for her husbonde to
do amys. But thou art not ashamed for christ to do amys. Thou art more free
than the woman / for thou art strenger and lyghtelyer / thou myghtest overcome
the flesh and the fend if thou wylt. Therefore god has bytaken the to
thyselfe. But a woman has much keeping of her husbonde / dredefull law /
good norture / great shame / fastness / and god pryncypall / and thou man
haste only god above the. Thy wife flees lecherye for dread and for shame of
the / for dread of the law / for good norture / and pryncypaly for god. But
for all these thou kepeste not thyselfe chaste / neither thou leueste not thy
lecherye neither for dread of god ne for gods law ne for shame of the world
/ ne for shame of thy wife to whom thou art bound to be true / ne thou wylt
leave it for no good norture / but live as an harlotte and use harlottes manners.
Thou art not ashamed of thy sins says saint Austen / for so many men fall
there in. The shrewednesse of man is now so great that men be more ashamed of
chastyte than of lecherye. Manquellers / thieves / periurers / false witness /
rauenours / and false men be abhomynable and hated among the people. But who
so will lie by his woman and be a bold lechoure / he that is loved is
praised. And all the wounds of his soul turn in to game And if any man be
so herdy to say that he is chaste and true to his wife. And if it be know
that he be such he is ashamed to come among men that be not like him in
manner For they should Iape and scorn hy^ and say that he is no man. For
man's shrewednes is now so great / that there is no man hold a man but he be
overcome with lecherye. And he that ouercometh lecherye and keeps him chaste
he is hold no man. These be the words of saint Austen in a book de december
cordis. Dives. Me meruayleth much that saint Austen and you also accuse man
so much of lecherye / and put more defaute in man than in woman. Pauper.
Christ did the same. We read in the gospel. Io.viij. that on a time when
christ satte in the temple of Jerusalem techynge the people his laws. Than the
scrybes and the men of law and the phareseys brought a woman newely taken in
auoutrye / and set her before christ and said to him all in gyle. Master /
this woman right now was take in auoutrye. The law of Moses byddeth us stone
all such / but what say thou there to. All this they said in gyle / for
had he bode them stone her / he had said against his own prechynge. For his
prechynge and techynge was full of mercy and pity. And if he had said that
she should not have be stoned / than had he said against Moses law and than
would they have stoned him. And therefore he said ne that one ne that other. But
he stouped down and wrote with his finger in the earth. And when he had
written a while / he set him vpryght again and said to them. Which of you be
without sin / he cast on her the first stone. And afterward he stouped
down and wrote in the earth. And when the accusers of the woman herd these
words of christ and see his writing / they were ashamed and went out each
after other / and the eldeste went out first / and none of them left there.
For as say these clerks / each of them saw in that writing all the evil
sins that he had done of lecherye of spousebreche or of any other sin. And
each of them wend that all other about had seen his sin. And so for dread
and for shame they went out / for they saw well that they were more gylty in
lecherye than the woman and more worthy to be stoned. But christ of his
goodness wrought so / that each of them saw there his own sin and none
other man's / so gyuynge us ensaumple to hid other men's sin / and not
defame our even christian while there sin is preuye. And when they were gone out
for dread and shame. Than said christ to the woman / where be they that accused
the. No man has dampened the. Lord says she that is soth no man has dampened
me. Than christ said to her. Ne I shall not dampne the. Goo and be in will no
more to sin. Dives. By y^ law she was worthy to be deed / why would than
christ that gave the law save her. Pauper. All though she were worthy to dye /
yet her accusers and the people that brought her thither were not worthy to
dampne her / ne to pursue her to death / for they were more gylty than the
woman. And therefore says the gloss in that place. Though the law bid them be
slain that be gyltye / yet the law will not that they should be slain by
them that be gylty in the same sin. But he that is unguilty in the same sin
shall punysshe him that is gylty. And therefore says the gloss / that they that
so accu s;ed the woman / by right of y^ law or they must have let her go or
ellis be stoned with her / for they were more gylty in yt sin than the woman.
And so by the law christ delivered her ryghtfully / and saved her mercyably.
Therefore says the law of holy church / that tho that be gylty in any great
sin should not be take for accusers ne witnesses in dome / no man queller /
no thieves / ne wicked Iogulers robbers of chirches / rauenours / ne open
lechours / ne they that be in auoutrye / ne they that poison folk / ne
periurers / ne falls witnesses / ne they that axe counseyll of wytches. All
these and such other be unable to accuse in dome / or to bear witness in dome
/ but if it be for to accuse them that be the fellows and helpers in there

Dives. Is a man bound to forsake his wife when she falls in fornycaco^n
Pauper Either the fornycaco^n is preuy / or it is open. If it be preuy and may
not be preued he shall not forsake her openly / ne he is not bound to forsake
her preuely / as anentes the bed. If her fornycaco^n be open / either there is
hope of amendment or there is none hope of amendment. If she will amend her
/ and there be good hope of amendment he may lefull keep her still. If there be
none hope of amendment he ought not to keep her stylle. For if he do it seems
yt he consent to her sin. su^ma ^fes.li.iiij. ti.xxij.q^. vi. q^ro. Dives.
May a man by his own auctoryte forsake his wife if she fall in fornycaco^n.
Pauper. As anentes her bed / he may forsake her by his own auctoryte / but not
anentes dwelling togydre without auctoryte of holy church. And if he forsake
her company as anent dwelling without auctotyte of holy church / he shall be
compelled to dwell with her / but he may anon preue her fornycaco^n. If a man
meddle with his wife after that yt he knows her fornycacyon he is yrreguler /
though he be co^co^pelled thereto by holy church. su^ma ^fes.li.iiij.
ti.xxij.q^.viij. vtru^ vir. If the husbonde be departed from his wife by
auctoryte of holy church. He may if he will enter in to relygyon without her
leave. But whether he enter or nay / he is bound to contynence all her life /
and he may none other wife have as long as she lives / for only death
departs the bound of wedlecke Dives. Contra. If a man wedde a woman he may
enter in to relygyon or he meddle with her / and she may take an other husbo^de
and yet neither of them is deed. Pauper. There is bodily death and goostly death /
that is enter in to relygyan. For than man or woman dies against the world. If
he meddle with her bodily / only bodily death may depart them as against the
bound of wedloke. But or yt he meddle with her bodily / goostly death that is
enter in to relygyon may depart them. For till when they meddle togydre bodily
/ the bound of there wedloke is but goostly. And therefore goostly death breketh
that bound. And for as much leave friend as the husbonde is as well bound to
keep faith to his wife / as the wife to the husbonde / therefore if the husbonde
trespass and fall in to fornycacyon / she has as great accyon against him as
he should have against his wife if she did a mys. Quia quo ad fidem matrimonij

Dives. I may well assente that auoutrye be a full grievous sin both in man
and in woman. But that simple fornycacyon between syngel man and syngel woman
should be dedly sin. I may not assent thereto. And common opynyit is / as that
it is no dedely sin. Pauper. Every sin that excludes man or woman out of
heaven is dedely sin / but simple fornycaco^n excludes man and woman out of
heaven but they amend them here / therefore than simple fornycacyon is dedely
sin. Dives. Where fyndest thou that simple fornycacyon excludes man and
woman out of heaven. Pauper. In the pystle of saint Poule where he says / that
no fornycaryes ne they yt do auoutrye / ne sodo mytes / ne thieves / ne
mawmetrers / ne glotons / ne wicked spekers / ne they yt live by rauyn / shall
have the kingdom of heaven.i. ad little.vi. And in the chaptre next before / he
byddeth y^ men should not meddle with such for nycaryes and with such wicked
lyuers not ete with them ne drink with them / for they be acursed of god and of
all the company of heaven. And in an other pystle saint Poule says thus. Wit
ye it well and understand ye it that no fornycarye ne unclean man of his body
/ ne false covetous man shall have heritage in y^ kingdom of christ and of
god. And therefore says he. Late ye no fornycacyon ne uncleanness ne auaryce be
named in you / ne fylth ne folly speech ne harlottre / but all manner honest as
it becomes saints. Ad ephe.v. And in an other place he says / that god shall
deem fornycaryes and them that do auoutrye. Ad hebreos.xiij. That is to say as
the gloss says. God shall dampne them without end / al though they wene not
so / but sythen y^ god gives no tale of flesshly sin. And therefore saint
John says in the book of gods preuytees to fornycaryes and manquellers /
liars and periurers / and such other cursed folk / their part shall be in y^
pyt wellynge and brennynge with fire and brymstone / which is the second death
of hell Apo.xxi. And the wise man byddeth that thou shall te not give thy soul
to fornycaryes in any thing that thou lose not the and thy soul and thyn
heritage in heaven. And every woman fornycarye shall be trodden under foot of the
fendes as derte in y^ way. Eccl.ix. Dives Contra. All the commandment of y^
second table be given of god to let wrongs y^ men should else do to there
even christian / but when a syngel man medleth with a syngell woman / he does no
man ne woman any wrong for either of them is in his own power. Pauper. Though
each of them be in his own power / yet each of them does other great wrong /
for each of them sleeth other by dedely sin / and each of them sleeth
himself / and each of them does wrong to god in yt yt they do against his
forbode / and slay the souls that he bought so dear. And both they do wrong
to there even christian in that yt they give them wicked ensample and matter of
sclau^dre. Dives Yet contra te. God says to every man and woman. Crescite et
multiplicamini. Wexe ye and be ye multyplyed Therefore than if a syngell man
meddle with a syngell woman to bring forth childern / it se^eth to me no sin.
Pauper. God said not tho words to every man and woman / but only to them that
were wedded togydre by gods law / that as they were wedded togydre to bring
forth childern / so god badde them bring forth childern. God said not tho
words to syngell folk / but to Adam and Eve his wife. And unto Noe and his
wife / and to his sons and their wives. And therefore Thobye said to his sone.
Attendite tibi fili mi ab omni fornicacione and^. My sone keep the from all
manner fornycacyon / ne meddle with none woman / but only with thy wife.
Thobie.iiij. ca. And saint Poule says. Mortificate me^bra vestra que sunt
super terra^. Slay ye your sinful members that be upon earth / slay ye
fornycacyon / uncleanness / lecherye. These be the members that he byddeth us
slay / not the parts of our body as the gloss says. And the gloss says
also. That every lyenge with a woman out of lawful wedlock is called
fornycacyon / and forboden as dedely sin. And therefore god badde in the old
law / that if the prestes douhhter were taken in fornycaco^n / she should be
burnt Leuitici.xxi. ca. And if any other man's daughter fell in to
fornycacyon in her faders house or she were wedded she should be stoned to death
Deut^.xxij. Therefore god would that his mother Marye should be wedded or he were
conceived of her. For if she had be found with child out of wedlock / the
Jews should have stoned her without wercy. And if it were lefull to syngell
man and syngell woman to meddle togydre and gendre / god had made matrymonye
in vain and there would noman knytte him vndepartably to any woman if he might
without sin meddle with what woman he would. Therefore christ in y^ gospel
dampened simple forntcacyon and all manner lecherye and says / that who so
looks on any woman in will to meddle with her out of matrymonye / he does
lechery against gods commandment and synneth dedely. Mathei.v. And therefore
as I said first generacyon and bringing forth of childern is granted only to
them that be wedded togydre lawfully.

Caplm.ix.
Dives. Be all wedded folk bound by this commandment of god. Crescite et
multiplica mini. To do there dylygence to byget childern. Pauper. Before mankind
was multyplyed / wedded folk were bound to do there dylygence to bring forth
childern. But now yt mankind is multyplyed / the commandment byndeth them not
so much to generaco^n But they be free to co^tynence and keep them chaste if
they be both of one assent thereto. For many reasons god or deyned yt man and
woman should not meddle togydre but they were wedded togydre. For by auctoryte
and fornycacyon falls full often that the brother lies by his sister and the
fader by his daughter. And many unlawful wedloke is made because of auoutre.
And he that does auoutrye he is a thief / and rob the man or woman of his
body that is better than any worldely catell. For the wives body is the
husbondes body / and his body is her body / for neither of them has power
of his own body to give it to any other by flesshely lust. And he that does
fornycaco^n he robs christ of his right both bodily and goostly And therefore
saint Poule says / that the lechour takes the membre of christ and makes it
the membre of y^ stru^pet with whom he medleth.i. ad little vi. Also by auoutrye
be made false heirs / and true heirs truly bygoten put out of there heritage.
Also by auoutrye gods law yt he made so solempnely in the beginning of the
world first of all laws is broken. And therefore he that breketh it is an
open traitor. To this accords the words of the wise man / where he says
that the woman which forsakes her husbonde and takes an other and makes
heritage of an other matrymony does many sins. First she is mysbyleuynge to
gods law / and breketh gods law. Also she trespaceth against her husbonde.
Also she does fornycaco^n in auoutrye and makes childern to her of an other
man But her sons shall give no rotes / and there branches shall give no
fruit. She shall leave there mind in cursynge and her shame shall never be do
away. Eccl.xxiij. And therefore says the gloss yt auoutry is as da^pnable in
the man as in the woman. And therefore in the same chaptre he repreueth auoutrye
and fornycaco^n in man full hyghely.

Caplm.x.
Dives. Reason and holy wryt dryueth me to grant yt both auoutrye and simple
fornycacyon be full grievous sin / but more grievous is auoutrye / and feign I
would keep me fro both sins. But wymen be the fendes snare / and so tempte me
to lecherye yt it is full hard to me to keep me. Adam Sampsonem Petrum David et
Salomonem Femina decepit. ^s modo tuttus erit. Woman deceived Adam Sampson
Peter Dauyd and Solomon / who may than be syker fro woman's gyle. Pauper. Many a
man has be desceyued by wicked wymen / more by his own folly than by dysceyte
of wymen. But many more wymen have be deceived by malice of men than ever were
men deceived by malice of wymen. And therefore the woman lechour is called the
snare of the fend yt hunteth after man's soul. For the wise man says Inueni
amariore^ morte muliere^ and^. I have found woman more bytterer than death.
Such is the snare of the hunter / her heart is a net and her hands be hard
bonds. He yt pleseth god shall ascape her / but the synful man shall be take
of her. Eccl.vij. But men be called not only y^ snare of the fend but also
they be called his net sprede abroad on the hylle of Tabor for to take many at
ones. Ozee.v. Man's malice is called a net spread a broad on an high hylle for
it is open and bodily done / not in a few but in many. And therefore when holy
write speaks of y^ malice of men / he speaks in the plurell nombre as to
many. But when he repreueth the malice of woman he speaks in the synguler
nombre as to few / in token yt there be more shrewes of men than of wymen / and
commonly more malice in men than in wymen / all though some woman be malycyous.
Fighting / robbery / manslaughter / open lechery / glotony / gyle / falsenesse
/ periurye / traytoury / false contryuynge / and such other horrible sins
reygne more in man than in woman. This false excusacy on yt excuse so there
sin by the malice of wymen / began first in Adam and lost Adam and all
mankind / for synfully he excused his sin by woman when god vndernam him of
his sin and put woman in defaute. Also he put god in defaute yt made woman
and answered full proudely / as men do now a days and said to god. The woman
that you gave to me to be my fellow yaue me of the tree and I ete thereof. As who
says. Had thou not given her to be my fellow I should not have sinned. And
so notwithstanding yt he was more in defaute than y^ woman / yet he would not
knowelege any defaute / but he put woman and god pryncypally yt made woman in
defaute. Dives. How was Adam more in defaute than woman Pauper. For to him
pryncypaly god gave the commandment yt he should not ete of that tree / and
Eve knew it not but by Adam. Woman was tempted by the fend wonderfully in the
adder which went yt time right up / and had a face like a woman. As Beda
says and the master of stories And she was dysceyued with his fair byhestes
and his false slye speech. For he behyght her that they should not dye but be
as gods knowing good and evil. Adam had no temptacyon from outward but a
simple word of his wife that proffered him the apple. For we find not that she
said to him any desceyuable word. And therefore sythen man was forboden of
gods mouth / and she not but by man / and man had less temptacyon than
woman / and thereto in no thing would accuse himself / ne yield him gylty /
but put defaute all in woman and in god / therefore he sinned more than woman /
for woman yield her gylty / but she axed no mercy. She made no such excusaco^n
/ but in a great part yielded her gylty / in that she said / the adder has
desceyued me. For in yt she knowleged that she was desceyued / she knowleged yt
she had do amys and unwisely / and otherwise than she ought to have do And
for that woman lowed her and knowleged her vnwysedom and her folly / therefore
god put in woman that time an hope of our saluaco^n when he said to the adder I
shall put enmyte between the and woman / and between thy sede and her sede /
and she shall break thyn head / that was the fend which was head and leder of
the adder that time. The sede of the fend be wicked works and wicked folk /
to whom god said in the gospel. Vos ex patre dyabolo estis. Io.viij. Ye be of
the fader the fend. The sede of the woman goostly be her good deeds / with
which the fend and the fendes lymes have great envy. And commonly wymen have
more horrybylyte of sin than men do. And by our lady blessed mote she be the
fendes powrr is destroyed. Also the sede of woman is christ born of the maid
Mary without part of man. And so there was never man proprely sede of woman
but christ allone / and always is enmyte between christ and the fend and his
sede. For as saint Poule says. Christ and Belyall / light and derkenesse may
not accord. For this reason saint Poule says / that Adam was not desceyued in
the first pryuarycaco^n / but woman was desceyued.i. ad. Thy.ij. And therefore
as the gloss says. When god Adam vndernam / he said not yt the woman had
desceyued me / as y^ woman said / the adder has desceyued me / but he said the
woman gave me of the tree and I have eten. And also as y^ gloss says there.
Adam was so wise yt he might not believe the fendes tales ne be desceyued in yt
manner as y^ woman was And for the woman was not so wise as Adam was therefore
she byleued y^ fendes tales and so was desceyued. And the wyser yt Adam was the
more was his sin when he fell. But though Adam was not deceived fro outward
by an other / he was desceyued fro inward by himself by preuy pride as says
saint Austen de ci.li.xiiij.c^. xiij. Where he says yt Adam and Eve began
first to be wicked inward / by which preuy wyckednes they fell in open
vnobedyence. For as he says there. Pride is beginning of every sin. Iniciu^
omnis peccati superbia. Eccl.x. And as Solomon says. Contricione precedit
superbia. et ante ruina^ exaltatur spu^s. Prouer.xvi. Before brekynge and
brysure gooth pride / and before open falling the spryte of a man and a woman
is enhaunsed by pride. And therefore says saint Austen in the same chaptre yt
both Adam and Eve were wicked and desceyued by pride / and well let of
themself before they ete of the tree. For preuy falling inward went before
open falling outward by inobedyence / and so Adam was desceyued and fell by
pride or Eve gaaf him the apple / and Eve was desceyued by pride or the serpent
desceyued her. For as says saint Austen vbi s^. They coueyted more excellence
and higher degree than god ordained them to. They both sinned grievously / but
Adam more grievously as I said first. And therefore saint Poule says / not all
men dyed through y^ sin of Eve but through y^ sin of Adam. Ne god said not to
Adam / cursed be y^ earth in Eues sin / ne he said cursed be y^ earth in your
sin. But to Adam allone he said / Cursed be the earth in thy work and in thy
sin. And therefore says saint Ambrose super luca^ That Eve sinned more by
freelte and vnstabylyte and chaungeabylyte than by shrewednes Mobilitate magis
animi quam prauitate peccauit. Christ becam not woman but man to save mankind.
That as mankind was lost by man / so mankind should be saved by man. And
therefore in manhede he would dye for mankind / for manhede had lost mankind.
And also he becam man and not woman to save the order of kind. And for yt
woman's sin was less grievous than Adams sin / and less dered mankind /
and woman was less infecte in the first pryuaricaco n than was man / therefore
god took his manhede only of woman with out part of man. And so in yt he bycam
man / he did great worship to man but in yt he took his manhede only of woman
without part of man / he did great worship to woman / for only of woman's kyn he
made medycyne to y^ sin of Adam / and to hele mankind of y^ hard sekenes of
Adams sin.

Dives. Thy words be wonderful. But I can not say against the for dread of
our lady mother and maid that gate grace to mankind and is our help in every
need. But yet I say as I said first woman desceyued Sampson yt was so
strong. Pauper. Woman desceyued him not till he had desceyued himself by
lecherye and mysgouernau^ce of himself. First he wedded an hethen woman
against gods law and against the will of his fader and mother for lust and
mysloue that he had to her. After that he lay by a common woman yt was
hethen. And after that he took an other hethen woman to his concubyne yt hight
Dali da ye which full desceyued him and brought him to his death. He was false
to god / and wymen were false to him wymen say that he was bysotted up on them
/ and therefore they treated him as a sot. He desceyued himself and did full
unwisely when he suffered a woman to bind him among his enemies and told an
hethen woman his couseyll / and in what thing his enemies might most dear
him. And all though god turned his folys deeds to y^ worship of god and of
gods law / yet Sampson was not excused thereby / for he did much amys and
much folly. Also Dauyd was desceyued by his mys lust and his lecherye / not by
the woman Bersabee as you saydest in thy verse. For thus we read in holy wryt in
the second book of kings xi. ca^. That on a time when king Dauyd rose from
his sleep after myd day and romed in his soler of his paleyse / he saw a
fair woman wasshe her in her soler / he knew not the woman / ne the woman
thought not on him ne knew not of his wicked will as the book showed there.
Anon he sent after this woman / and when she came to him he lay by her and
bygate her with child. And anon as he knew that she was with child / to hyde
his sin / he sent after her husbonde Vrye yt he should come home and meddle
with his wife yt the child should be named to him and not to Dauyd. And for the
good knight would not come home at his wife ne use lust of his body whiles
gods oost lay in y^ field in syege of a cite that hight Rabath Dauyd sent him
again with lettres of his death to Ioab the prince of y^ oost and traytourly did
him slay. Here mygh test y^ see that Dauyd was overcome with lecherye and
desceyued by the fend or the woman came to him. For as christ says in the
gospel / for who so looks on a woman in will to do amys with her / anon he
has do lecherye and forfetteth against this commandment. Non mechaberis.
Dauyd looked on that woman in will to do lecherye when y^ woman thought none
enyll. He sent after her as after his lege woman and she wyste not why And when
she came to him as to her king / he lay by her synfully / for it was full hard
to her to let him. Also Peter forsook christ in time of his passion and ran
away fro christ or any woman spoke to him yt time and so he desceyued himself
/ and the woman desceyued him not / she did her office / for she was vsshere
and keeper at the door / as the gloss says and saint Gregorye / and she said to
him that he was one of crystus dyscyples as she said soth. For she was bound
yt she should let none of crystus dyscyples enter. And anon at y^ first word
he forsook christ and said yt he knew him not. And not only woman did saint
Peter forsake christ in this manner / but men said to him y^ same words / and
for dread he forsook christ soon after and swore yt he knew him not. And
therefore if it be repreue to woman yt woman made saint Peter for sake christ /
as much repreue it is to men much more. For all though he forsook christ at
y^ woman's word / yet he swore not therefore ne forswore him till men said to him
the same words. Math xxvi. et Mar.xiiij. Also Solomon desceyued himself or
any woman desceyued him / for he took to hy^ many hethen women of false believe
to have his lust. He sought them they sought not him. He wist well yt it was
against gods law a king to have so many wives and concubynes as he had. For
god bad y^ kings of his people should not have many wives / ne multeplye them
many horses in greuau ce of the people / ne multeplye to him great weyghtes of
gold and silver in disease of the people / as holy wryt shows well.
Deut^.xvij. Also it was forboden to him and to all other so to company with
hethen wymen And against all this did Solomon in high offense of god. Solomon
sought the company of hethen wymen. The wymen were stable in their false
believe. He was unstable in his right believe and followed her false believe / and
forsook gods law in a great part / and worshypped false gods. Lecherye
ouercam him long or many of the wymen knew him. And so be men right now a
days ouercomen with lecherye with out womannes company and without doing of
wymen. For as christ says in the gospel. Who so looks on a woman in will to
do amys with her / though she thinks not on him he does lecherye. And if he
handle her or smell her or speak to her or go to her or seek by wyses / or by
sleyghtes to have his lust of her / though the woman consent not to him / and
though he be lets of his wicked will / yet he is gylty in lecherye / and
does against this commandment of god. Non mechaberis. Men lecherous gone and
ride fro town to town to get wymen after their lust. They seek the wymen /
and not the wymen them. They cast many wyles to get woman's assent in sin.
Men commonly be werkers and begynners of lecherye / and than whether the woman
assent or not assent / yet the man is gylty. And for oftentyme it falls that
when men wend to be seker of the woman's assent / than the woman will not
assent for dread of god / and if she assented before and hight the man to
follow his lust and after repents her and withdraws her from his wicked
company / than shall the lecherous man dyffame all wymen / and say that they
be false and desceyuable. For such lechours speken most vylonye of wymen /
for yt they may not have there foul lust of them at will / and for they may not
defoule them with there bodies / they defoule them with there tongues / and speak
of them full evil and defame them falsely / and procure to them the harm that
they may. Example we have in the book of Danyell.xiij. ca. Of the good woman
Susanne and two false old prestes that were Iuges and governors of the people
for that year / which by one assent waited to have this woman allone in her
gardeyne / when she should go to wasshe her as the manner was that time. And for
she would not assent to there wickedness but cried after help / anon they
cried against her. And when men come / they said that they found her lyenge
with a young man / and so falsely dampened her to death / for that they might not
do their foul lust with her. But at the prayer of Susanne god sent Danyell
his prophet and took them and conuecte them in their falsehode and slough
them and saved Susanne. We find also in the second book of kings the.xiij.
ca. That Aamon the sone of Dauyd feigned him seek and prayed his fader Dauyd
that Thamer his sister might come and keep him. And when she was come he spoke
to her for to lie by her but she would not assent. And than he oppressed her /
and so defouled his own sister. And anon he hated her more than ever he loved
her before because that she would not assent to him / and spytefully put her
out of his chamber and did shette the door after her For this deed Aamon was
slain soon after of his brother Absolon.

Dives. And yet many a woman will assent to lust of flesh full lyghtely if
it be proufred. Pauper. That is soth. But wymen be not so ready to assent as men
be to proufre it. And he that profereth it and begins he assenteth first
and is more in defaute. Dives Thou excusest most wymen / and accuseste men.
Pauper. I accuse no good man / but lecherous men / ne I excuse no wicked woman
/ but good wymen that be falsely defamed of le cherye / not only in there
persons / but in there kind generally. For the proud malice of man defameth
vnresonably the kind of woman. And as Adam did put his sin on woman and
would not excuse his own malice to get mercy. Dives. Solomon speaks much
evil of wymen. Pauper. And Solomon speaks much good of wymen. For he said.
Mulier timens dn^i. ipsa laudabit^. The woman y^ dredeth god she shall be
praised. Solomon repreueth wicked wyman and prayseth good wymen / and he
repreueth wicked men and prayseth good men. Dives. Solomon says Omnis malicia
nequicia mulieris. Breuis est omnis malicia super maliciam mulieris. Eccl.xxv.
The wickedness of woman is all malice / and every malice is short above the
malice of woman. Pauper. Soth it is when wymen give them to shrewednesse than
they be full malycyouse. And when they give them to goodness they be full
good. And therefore the wise man in y^ next chaptre following prayseth wymen
full much and says / that blessed is that man that has a good woman to his
wife His years shall be doubled / he shall end his years in peace. A good woman is
a good part / and a good part of them that dread god / and she shall be
given to a man for his good deeds. The grace of the besy woman shall like her
husbonde and make his bones fat. Her dyscyplyne and her norture is the gytte
of god. And the holy woman and chaste is grace upon grace And as the son
shynyng lyghtneth the world in the heyght of the day / so the beauty of a
good woman is in confort and array of her husbonde. And as golden pyleris set on
silver basys / so be syker fete on the soles of the stable woman. And endeles
grou^des on a seker stone be gods commandment in the heart of an holy woman
Fundamenta eterna super petra^ solida^mandata dei in cord mulieris sancte
Eccl.xxvi. Dives. Solomon says Vinum et mulieres a potestate faciu^t
sapientes. Eccl.xix. Wine and wymen make wise men to dote and to forsake gods
law and do amys. Pauper. And yet there is no defaute in the wine / ne
oftentimes in the woman. But defaute is in him that unwisely use the wine / and
unwisely uses the woman and other gods creatures Though thou drink wine
till thou art dronken and falleste in lecherye by thy glotonye / the wine is
not to blame / but thou that canste not or wylt not mesure thyselfe. And though
thou look on a woman and art caught in her beauty / and assentest to do amys /
the woman in case is not to blame / ne her beauty not to lack that god has
given her. But thou art to blame that no better kepest thyn heart from wicked
thoughts. But there thou sholdest praise god / thou thynkest evil / and
mysusest gods fair creature in offense of god there y^ sholdest praise him.
And if thou feleste the tempted by the sight of woman / keep thy sight better.
And if her dalyau^ce styre the to lecherye / flee her company. For against
lecherye flight is best fight. Thou art free to go away fro her / no thing
byndeth the to do lecherye but thy lecherous heart.

Caplm.xiij.
Dives. Woman's array styreth noche folk to do lecherye. Pauper. All though in
case the array and the atyre is not to blame no more than is her beauty. Yet by
common course of kind both man and woman seek to be honestly arrayed after there
astate and after there degree / and after the custom of the contre yt they dwell
in / not to tempte folk to lecherye / ne for pride / ne for none other sin /
but for honest of mankind and to y^ worship of god / to whose likeness man
and woman is made. And he is our brother / and this is the custom of good
folk But if they do it for pride / or to tempte folk to lecherye or for any
other sin / or yt they took on them atyre yt is not according to them if it
be to costfull or to strange in shap / or to wide or to side not ruled by
reason / they sin full grievously in the sight of god. And namely tho men yt
cloth them so short / that man and woman may see the form of the shap of
there preuy members which be shameful to show / and the sight is great cause
of temptacyon and of wicked thoughts. Saint Poule bydeth yt wymen should atyre
them to honest array with shamefastness and sobrenesse / not in broydynge of
there here / not in gold and silver / ne in parrye ne in ouerdone clothe pri.^
ad Thy.ij. And the same says saint Peter in his first pystle. iij. ca. Where
he byddeth y^ men should have there wives in worship and keep them honostly.
Dives. Wymen now a days array them full much against the techynge of Peter
and Poule and therefore I dread me that they sin full grievously. Pauper. Peter
and Poule forbyde not utterly such array But they forbyde wymen such array to
use in pride / or to provoke folk to secherye and to use such array passing
there astate / or for an evil end For we find that saint Cecyle and many
other holy wymen went arrayed in clothes of gold and in rich perrye, and wered
the hair under y^ solemp ne atyre. And Peter and Poule said tho words
pryncypally for time of prayers / as for lent / ymbre days / gangedayes /
frydayes / vigylyes / and in time of general processyon made for need. In
such time namely man and woman should leave all tokens and signs of pride in
array. For as the gloss says. There proud clothing get the no good of god
and makes folk to deem amys / namely if it pass mesure and good manner. The
pryncypall entencyon of saint Poule there he says tho words / is to enfourme
men and wymen in prayers. For whom they should pray why and how and where
they shall pray as says the gloss. And he enformeth them to pray in lowness
/ without pomp of clothing and of great array. For I am syker / that the
foul stynkynge pomp and pride of array that is now used in this land in all
three parties of the church. That is to lay / in the feudorys / and in clergy
/ and in comoners will not be vnuenged. But if it be soon amended by very
repentance and forsakynge of this sin. For fro the hygheste unto the lowest
in every astate and in every degree / and nyghe hand in every person is now
array passing to man's body and woman's against all reason and the law of
god. Dives. Sythen it is so that man is more pryncypall in order of kind than
is woman / and more stable and mighty and of higher dyscrecyon by course of
kind than is woman / and should as thou have well said be more virtuous and
stable in goodness than woman / how may it be that wymen keep them often more
chaste and be more stable in goodness than man. For we see that when men take
them to be ankeres and recluses within a few years commonly either they fall
in reuerses / or heresies / or they break out for woman's love / or for trouble
of there life / or by some gyle of y^ fend. But of wymen ancres so inclused is
seldon herd any of these defaut / but holyly they begin and holyly they
end. Pauper. Men by way of kind is more stable than is wymen and of more
dyscrecyon / but by grace wymen be often more stable in goodness than be men and
have better dyscreco^n in goodness than many a man. Dives. Why so. Pauper For
men trust to much in themself and trust not in god as they ought to do /
wymen knowing there freeite trust not in themself / but only in god and
commend them more to god than do men oftyme. And the wise man says. Inicium
sapiencie timor dn^i. Prouer.ix. ca. psalm. no. The dread of the lord is
beginning of wysedom For who so dredeth god with love dread as y^ good child
the fader / that love dread shall teache him what is plesaunt to god / and what
may displease him. And it shall make him besy to do his plesaunce and to leave
his offense. And commonly when men become ancres they do it moro for the world
than for god. They do it for ypocresye to have a name of holiness and of wysdom
/ or for couetyse to get good or to be out of obedyence / and at there own will
/ to ete and to drink / wake and sleep when them lyketh / and to do as them
lyketh. For there shall no man repreue them thereof / ne wit whether they do
well or evil / or whether they pray or they pray not And commonly men ancres
have more dalyaunce with the world both with men and wymen than ever they had
or they were ancres. And though they were lewd fools before / than men hold
them wise / and axe of them doubts of conscience and of things that be to
come / of the which things they can no skyll. And yet what they say / the
people takes it for a gospel / and so they desceyue many a man and many a
woman. And sythen they ground them all in pride / in ypocresye / and in
couetyse / and trust in themself more than in god therefore he suffers the
tend to have power over them / and so dyseased them and brings them to a
wicked end. But wymen take often y^ state for no such end / but only for god
And they seeing there own freelte commend them to god. And therefore god
keeps them so / that the fend may not disease them in such manner ne
dysceyue them. We read in holy wryt Gen^.xij. et.xx. That when Abraham came in
to strange lands / he bad his wife Saray that she should not be aknowen that
she was his wife / but say that she was his sister For she was so fair a
woman that he wyste well that men should coueyte her for her beauty. And if
they wend that she were his wife / they should slay him to have her at their
will / for auoutrye was harder punysshed than manslaughter. And therefore to
save his life Abraham said and bad her say that she was his sister. For as
doctor de lyra says. Abraham wyste well that she was a good woman / and had
such an angel to keep her that no man should have power to defoule her / and
so it befell. For anon she was take and led to the king of Egypt and kept
there in the kings court long time. And Abraham fared well by cause of her.
But god sent such a sickness to y^ king and to his wives and to his
concubynes and to all his household / that they had no might ne liking to
defoule her. Than the king axed his prestes and masters of the law why that
disease fell unto him and to his household. And they by reuelacyon of god
sayden that it was for the pilgrims wife. And than the king let him go with
worship. We read also that Abraham had two sons. Ysmaell of Agar his
servant and Ysaac of Sara his wife. Abraham loved well Ysmaell / for he was y^
elder sone. On a time Sara saw Ysmaell play with her sone Ysaac not goodly /
she was myspayde and said to Abraham that he should put Ysmaell and his mother
Agar out of household / for Ysmaell said she should have no part of heritage
with her sone Ysaac. Abraham bare full heavy of these words / for he loved
much Ysmaell. Than god said to Abraham. Take it not so hard ne so sharply
that Sara said to the of thy child and of thy servant Agar But in all things
that Sara says to the / here her voice and do there after. And than Abraham
put them out of his household full much against his heart. And so
notwithstanding that Abraham was so nyghe god that he was called gods
friend / yet as than his wife knew more of gods will than he did. Also we
read of Ysaac and Rebecca his wife that they had two sons borne at ones
which were Esau and Jacob Ysaac loved better Esau than Jacob. But Rebecca
loved better Jacob than Esau / and so did god. And by techyng of the holy ghost
she begyled Ysaac and Esau also / and did Ysaac give his pryncypall blessing
to Jacob / there he would have given it to Esau and all was gods deed and so
confermed by god / that when Ysaac wist of that gyle / yet he durst not
withdraw his blessing / for he saw well that it was gods will and gods
doing. And therefore he said to Esau weeping for he was so begyled. Benedixi ei.
et erit benedictus. I have blessed him / and he shall be blessed.

Dives. I assent well that by grace a woman may be as stable in chastyte and
in goodness as man. And without grace neither man ne woman may keep him
chaste. For the flesh both of man and woman is full freell and full redye to
fall. And therefore I pray the teache me some remedy ayenste the temptacyon of
lecherye. Pauper. One remedy is reasonable / abstynence from mete and drink /
and for to flee deynte metes and deynte drynkes / and to flee glotonye as most
beginning and mean to lechery And therefore glotony is forboden by this
commandment as mean and way to lecherye. And other remedy is hard lyenge /
watch and trauayll that the body have not to much ease / but be well
occupied. For the wise man says. That ydelshyppe has taught much malice.
Multam enim maliciam docuit dciositas. Therefore says he. Right as to the ass
longs fedynge / yerde and byrdeyne / so to the servant / that is to say /
to the flesh that should be suget and servant to the soul / longs dread
and chastysynge / and works of good occupacyon. Eccl.xxxiij. And god says
that pride and plente of bread / and welfare / and plente of rychesses / and
ydelshyppe were cause of the wickedness of the Sodomytes / and of there
lecherye / and for they loved not poor folk. Ezechi.xvi. And therefore
almesdede is a great remedy against lecherye / to get grace of chastyte / so
that it be given to the poor nedye that been in myscheef / and to such that
have not by kind to get there lyuelode by trauayll of there body / and if they
beg they do it without auaryce / with meekness and clennesse of living /
to such byddeth christ to do alms saying. Date elimosinam. et ecce omnia
munda sunt vobis Luce. Give ye alms / and lo all things be clean to you if
ye will amend you. And an other remedy is a man to have mind of his death /
and think how he shall wend hense with bitter pain and than all his lust
shall turn in to woo and sorrow and think that by man or woman never so
fair / so welfarynge / so hole / so lusty / so liking to the eye / so mighty
/ so wytty / so great of lynage / so rich / so great of name or of lordshypp.
Either by man either woman / be he ever so plesau^t he shall dye and turn to
earth and ashes and worms mete. And if he smell now never so sweet he shall
stynke than full sour. Therefore the wise man says In omnibus operibus tuis
memorare noui s;sima tua et ineternu^ no^ peccabis. Eccl.vij. In all these
works think on thy last things / and thou shall not do no sin without
end. We read yt in England was a king that had a concubyne whose name was
Rose. And for her great beauty he called her Rose amou^de. Rosa mundi. That is
to say. Rose of the world. For him thought yt she passed all wymen in beauty.
It befell that she dyed and was buried while the king was absent. And when he
came again for great love that he had to her / he would see the body in the
grave. And when the grave was opened / there sat an horrible tode upon her
breast by twene her tetys / and a foul adder bygyrt her body about in the
mydle / and she stanke so yt the king ne none other might stand to see that
horrible sight. Than the king did shette again the grave / and did write these
two verses upon the grave. Hic iacet in tumba. rosa mundi no^ rosa mu^da Non
redolet sed olet quod redolere solet That is thus to say in english Here
lies in grave rose of the world / but not clean rose. She smells not sweet
but stytketh full foul / that sometime smelled full sweet. And an other remedy
against lecherye is that a man and woman keep well there five wits / that a man
keep well his hands and his body from mystouchynge / his eeres fro mysherynge
that he here no tales of lecherye / ne foul speech. For saint Poule says.
Corru^piunt bonos mores colloquia praua.i. ad Little.xv. Wicked speech destroyed
chastyte and good thewes. Also he must keep well his sight / taking example of
Job which made a covenant with his eyes / that he should not think on a
maiden to have myllykyng in the thought. And the prophet Ieremye said yt his
eye had robbed his soul in the woman of his cite. Trenorum.iij. For these
reasons the prophet said / yt death is entered by our wyndowes / that is to say
/ by our five wits which be wyndowes and wykettes to the soul. Ieremye.ix.
And an other remedy is a man to keep well his heart from ydell thoughts / and
from wicked things. For as christ says in the gospel / out of the heart
comen wicked thoughte^ / man slaughter / auoutre / fornycaco^n / theeft / false
witness / blasphemye. Mathei. xv. And therefore says the wise man Omni
custodia serua cor tuu^. Prouer. iiij. With all keeping keep well thyn heart /
for of the heart comes life and death. The master of kinds li.xviij Says
that there is a best that is called taxus / that is a brok or a bawsym in
English. And there is a great enmyte between the fox and him. The fox is
besy to put the bawsym out of his den. And for he may not do it by might /
he does it by sleyght He wayteth till when the bawsym is gone out of his den
/ than he gooth and pysseth and makes foul the bawsyms den. And for y^
bawsym hate stenche and uncleanness / when he comes and fyndeth his den so
stynkynge and so defouled he forsakes his den and seeks him an other. And
than the fox enters / and there he brings forth a shrewed broad. By the
bawsym that hates stenche and vnclenne s;se is understand christ Ihesus born
of the maid flower of clennesse By the fox is understand the fend which is
about night and day to put christ out of his den / that is man's soul
and woman's. For man's soul is gods den / gods temple / gods house /
gods dwelling place. And for the fend may not put him out by might / he
puts him out by sleyght. He makes foul man's soul and woman's / he
puts in there souls foul stynkynge thoughts of lecherye / first small and
after gretter. And anon as man or woman begins to have liking in such
thoughts / anon there soul begins to stynke in gods sight / and if they
assent to the thoughts to do them in deed / or for to delight them therein.
Than there souls stynke so foul in gods sight that he forsakes tho souls
and gooth out / and than the fend enters therein. And there he brings forth
sin upon sin / till at the last he brings them from shame to shame / to
wicked death / and to a wicked end. Therefore saint Austen in his sermon byddeth
us that we should travail that our god find no thing in his temple / that is
to say in our souls that may offend the eyes of his mageste. But the
dwelling of our heart mote be voyded of vices / and filled with virtues / and
shette to the fend and open to christ.

Caplm.xv.
AN other remedy against the temptaco^n of lecherye is deuo cyon and mind of
crystus passion. For as saint Gregorye says. There is none so hard temptacyon
/ but that man should overcome easily enough if he thought entyrely on crystus
passion. We find in gestys that on a time a great kings sone loved well a
poor woman. For though she was poor yet she was fair and plesaunt in
berynge. The kings sone took her to his paramoure and wedded her. Wherefore his
fader and nyghe all his kynne was myspayde. For them thought yt he was much
dysperached by her / wherefore he seeing that his kynrede bare so heavy of his
marriage / he went in to fer lands and gaf him to arms / and what he might
win with his sword he sent it home to his wife saving his worship and his
living. In every Journey he had the better of his enmyes / and so his name
began to spring fer and wide At yt last he came in so hard a fight all though
he had the maystrye / yet he was so wounded that needs he must dye. Than he
sent home his sharte full of wounds and of holes and all forbleded to his
wife with a lettre under his seal saying in this wise. Cerne cicatrices.
veteris vestigia pugne. Quesiui proprio sanguine quic^d habes. Behold my
wounds and have them in thy thought. For all the goods that be thyn with my
blood I have them bought. And when this woman saw this sharte and read the
letter / she fell down in swowne And when she was releued she henge up this
sharte in a preuy place of her chamber / and when ever any man came to her to
speak of weddyng or of flesshely lust / she went in to her chamber and looked
on his sharte / and came out again styffe and steadfast in her husbondes love
that was deed and denied them there axynge saying in this manner While I have his
blood in my mind / that was to me so good and kind. Shall I never husbonde
take / but him that dyed for my sake. And thus she kept her in clennesse and
chastyte all her life for love of her husbonde that dyed for her love. By this
poor woman that was so fair is understand man's soul and woman's which is
made to the likeness of god. But it was made full poor through the sin of
Adam. By the kings sone is understand christ gods sone which loved so much
man's soul / that as saint Poule says / he auentysshed himself and
dysparyched himself in to the likeness of a servant / and married to him our
kind and man's soul and lived here two and thrytty winter and more in much
woo to win the love of man's soul and faught against the fend / the flesh
and the word that be always besye to lose man's soul. And always he had
the maystrye by might of the godhede. But on go de frydaye he came in so fell a
fight with yt tyrau^t the fend of hell that though he had yt maystrye / yet
he was so forwou^ded yt by way of manhood which he took of yt maid nedely he
must dye. And than he sent home a letter of love to his spouse man's soul
saying as yt knight said. Cerne cicatrices and^. Behold my wou^des and have
them in thy thought / for all the goods yt be thyn with my blood I have them
bought. For why all the Joy and blys that we should have in heaven and all the
grace and goodness that we have here in earth all have we by virtue of crystus
passion. For but he would have dyed for our sake else should we have layne in
hell pain with out end. By this sharte full of wou^des and so blodye I
understand his blysfull body. For as man's body is clad in his sharte / so
yt godhede was clothed in the blysfull body of christ which body was all
blody and so full of wou^des / yt as says yt prophet Ysa.i. Fro the sole of
the foot to the top of the head there was no hole place in his body. Therefore
leave friend I pray you hang ye this sharte in a preuy place of your chamber.
That is to say. Set ye crystus passion entyrely in your heart. And when the
fend the world or the flesh / or any wicked man or woman begins for to
tempte you to sin / anon wend ye to your heart and look ye on this sharte
Think how that blysfull body was borne of the maid Mary without sin and
sorrow and never did amys. Think how it was forrent and for turn /
byspetted for our sin and our sake / and not for his own gylte. And if ye do
so and think entyrely on crystus passion / ye shall lyghtely overcome every
temptacyon and have the better pacyence in trybulacyon Wherefore an holy man
says thus. Reminiscens sacrati sanguinis que^ effudit amator hominis. effunden
do lacrimas. Non est locus ingratitudini. vbi torrens tante dulcedinis at
tingit animas and^. When I think on crystus blood that he shed upon the rode
I let teres smert. What man may be unkind that crystus blood has in mind
entyrely in his heart. Sweet Ihesu christ what is thy gylt that thou thus for
me art spylt flower of vnlothfulnes. I am a thief and thou dyeste I am gylty
and thou obeyest all my wyckednes. Why gave thou so much for thine what
wynnest y^ with thine hard pain rich in bliss above. Love thine heart so
deep has sought that pain of death lets me nouht to win man's love. An
other remedy against lecherye is redynge and dalyau^ce of holy wryt and of holy
men's lives. And therefore saint Ierom says ad rusticu^ monachum. Ama
scienciam scripturarum et carnis vicia no^ amabis. Love conning of holy wryt
and of gods law / and thou shall not love vices of the flesh. And therefore
god says. Non videbit me homo et viuet. Exodi. xxxiij. There shall no man see
me by devotion and live flesshely. For noothynge sleeth so much the lust of
the flesh as devotion / and think on god and to study gods law. And an
other remedy is to think on hell pain. For as says saint Thomas de veritate
theology. In hell shall be ouerdone hete of fire and gnastynge of teeth for
cold and for pain / derkenesse and smoke and bitter weeping without end.
Rorynge and belewynge of foul fendes / weeping and weylynge* sobbing and
syghynge of sinful souls / and endeles repreue of there sins / endless dread
/ endless thyrste / stenche / light / thondre / and worm of conscience / bonds
/ prison / dread / shame / wantynge of the blysfull sight of gods face / and
woo without any hope of any welthe. There men shall seek death and not find it
/ and wysshe that they never had be borne. And as saint Bernarde says in his
medytaco^ns. There shall be herd we pynge and gnastyng of teeth / roryng of
fendes and hydeous thondre. There yt sight shall be foul / worms / todes /
adders / and horrible faces of the fendes and mysshape things. There wicked
worms shall gnawe the heart rotes / there shall be sorrow and syghynge and
horrible dread. There sinful wretches shall brenne in the fire without end.
In there body they shall be tourmented by fire / and in there soul by worm of
conscience. There shall be death without death / for always they shall be in
deynge and in utter pain and may not dye / but always live in deynge There
smelling shall be filled with horrible stenche / for there shall be no hope.
But when they be in these pains ten hundred years / yet there pain in new all
to begin. And therefore if love of god and mede in heaven styreth us not to
flee lecherye and all other sins / let us flee lecherye and all other
sins for dread of endelesse pain.

Caplm.xvi.
ANd an another remedy against lechery is to think of yt hard vengeau^ces yt
god has take for lecherye. First take heed what vengeance god has take for
simple fornycaco^n. We find in holy wryt. Gen^.xxxiiij. That Dyua yt daughter
of Jacob went fro home to see yt wymen of that contre and to see there atyre
Than Sychem yt sone of Emor prince of yt contre went and defouled this Dyua by
might. And not withstandyng his besynes for to have wedded her / yet he was
slain for his lechery and his fader and all the men of yt cite / and that cite
destroyed. We read also in holy wryt Numeri.xxv. For yt the childeren of
Israel did lecherye w^ the wymen of Moab / god was offended / and bad Moses
take yt princes of his people and hang them upon Iebetes / for they were
assenting to the sin / and bad every man slay his neighbor that was gylty
in yt sin. For by lecherye they fell in to ydolatrye. And so for yt lecherye
were slain that time.xxiiij. thousand. Than Phynees the sone of Eleazar saw
one of yt childern of Israel by one of the wymen / and to venge his sin he
took his sword and roof them both togydre in to the earth through their preuy
members. And god was so much plesed with his deed / that he granted to him
and to his childern after him the dygnyte of preesthode without end. For but
he had do that deed god should else have destroyed the people. Also for
auoutrye and unlawful wedloke all mankind was destroyed in time of Noes flood
save.viij. souls. Gen^. vi. And for defoulynge of one man's wife were slain
three score thousand and five thousand and all a contre / and a great cite
destroyed at the bidding of god. Iudicu^.xix. et.xx. Also Dauyd for auoutrye
was dreuen out of his kingdom / and he and al his household and all his kynrede
were afterward full hard punysshed for his lecherye.ij. Re.xi. et.xij. And by
the old law both man and woman should be slain if they were take in
auoutrye. We read that Judas the sone of Jacob had three sons by one woman.
Her Onam and Selam. But Her yt was the eldest sone was a shrewe and mysused his
own wife / wherefore god was wroth with him and slough him with sudden death /
for he used his wife in lust and would not by get childern of her / but did
so yt she should not conceive. Gen^.xxxviij. Also for lecherye seven husbondes
of Sara that was afterward the wife of young Thobye were slain of yt tend
for there foul lust. Thobie.vi. Also for lecherye of them yt be of kynre de
and of affynyte / god has take hard wrath / as when Aamon lay by his sister
Thamer / he was slain of his brother Absolon. And Loath the brother of Abraham by
dronkenshyp lay by his own two daughters and bygate of them two childern Moab
and Amon / which childern and the people that came of them were always
enemies to gods folk and acursed of god. Also Jacob cursed his sone Ruben
for he lay with one of his wives. Also for the foul sin of Sodom five
fair cytees Sodom and Gomor and other three cytees were destroyed in time of
Abraham. For god rayned upon them fire and brymstone from above. And the earth
shoke so and trembled that they sonke down in to hell house / land / man and

his two daughters his wife might have be saved / but for that she looked again to
the cite against the angels bidding / when she herd the sorrowful cry of them
that perysshed / therefore she turned in to a salt stone. For the angel bad
them streytly yt they should not look again. And all yt contre which was before
lykened to paradyse for fayrenesse and plente of the contre / turned in to a
foul stynkynge podell yt lasts in to this day / and is called the deed see.
For there may no thing live therein for fylth and stenche in vengeance of yt
stynkynge lecherye. Gen^.xij. Dives. Me meruayleth much yt god took so general
wrath to slay man and woman and child. For I am syker there were many childern
full young and unguilty in that sin. Also we find not that wymen were than
gylty in that sin. The book says that all the people of men fro the child
male to the old came to do yt sin / but of wymen speaks he not that any came
thereto. Pauper. Though woman use not yt sin / yet they were gylty in yt that
they forsook not there husbondes that were gylty. For sodomye is most
suffycyent cause of dyuorce between husbonde and wife when it is openly used
And sith they would not forsake there husbondes in yt horrible sin / in manner
they assented to there sin / and so ryghtfully they perysshed in sin with
them. Of the childern unguilty the master of stories says / that god slough
them for there best. For if they had lived forth in to mighty age they should
have followed the lechery of there faders / and so it was better to them to dye
or they were gylty / than to have lived longer and dyed gylty and go to hell
without end.

Dives. Fell there any vengeance for lechery of men of holy church. Pauper.
We find in the second book of kings vi.ca. That there was a deken in y^ old
law whose name was Oza. And when he touched yt hutche either ark of god to
hold it up when it should else have fall / his right arm seryd and dried
suddenly / and anon he dyed. For as the master of stories says. That night
he had deled with his wife. Sith than the deken of the old law was so hard
punysshed for he touched gods hutche yt else should have fall / for he meddled
yt night with his wife / much more prestes and dekens of the new law be
worthy much woe if they presume to touch gods body or to mynystre at gods
altar when as they have comoned with other men's wives / or with there
concubynes. And therefore the law byddeth streytely that there should no man ne
woman here mass of the priest which that he knows sykerly that he holds a
concubyne / or is an open lecherour and notorye. Distinc.xxxij. nullus and^.

priest lechour should lay any mass / or any deken lechour read any gospel /
or any subdeken read any pystle in the office of holy church. And in an other
place the law byddeth that such notorye lechours should have no office in
holy church ne benefyce / and if they had but if they would amend them / they
should be pryued both of office and of benefyce. Distinc. xxviij. decreuimus.
And if any man of holy church hou^ted much the place and the company of

Though a priest be a shrewe / the sacraments that he mynystreth be not the
worse. For the goodness of y^ pressed amendeth not the sacrament. Ne his
wickedness appears them not / as the law shows well in the same place.
Vbi supra proximo caplo. vestra. Pauper. Why forbydeth than the law men to
here masses of sinful prestes lechours The law says that falling fro the
higher chastyte that is voued to god is more and wors than auoutrye. For sythen
god is offended when the wife keeps not faith to her bodily husbonde / or the
husbonde keeps not faith to his wife / much more is god offended if faith of
chastyte is not kept to him which was prouffered to him freely / not axed
nedely. And the more freely it was made without compellynge / the morer sin
is the brekynge.xxvi.q^.i. Nupclarum in fine ca. et ca. impudicas. et ca.
scien. Also the law says that the sin that is done inmedyatly against god is
more sin than the sin that is do pryncypally against man And therefore says
he / sacrylege is more sin than any fornycacyon or auoutrye.xvij.q^.iiij.
sunt ^. Dives. Contra te. The law says that auoutrye is most of all
sins.xxxij. q^.vij. ^d in omnibus. Pauper. The gloss answers thereto and
says / that it is a manner of speech to do wlate auoutrye and showing that
auoutrye is full grievous. But he says there / that manslaughter and Inceste
and sacrylege by brekynge of y^ vow of chastyte is more grievous. And also it
may be take for goostly auoutre That is when a christian soul forsakes the
faith of holy church that he resceyued in his baptem / and forsakes christ to
whom he wedded him and tourneth to the fend and to false believe. And every
dedely sin is goostly auoutrye. Dives. I am answered say forth what y^ wylt.
Pauper. Also lecherye is more sin in men of holy church than in wedded folk
because of the person. For men of holy church may better withstand the
flesshely temptacyon than wedded men / for they ought to pass the people in
conning and virtue. And therefore god says in the gospel. That the servant
knowing the will of his lord and not doing his will shall be hard punysshed.
Also for his unkindness / for why / the gretter his benefyce is and the more
that his dygnyte is / the more is he bound to god and the more is his sin if
he be unkind. And therefore holy wryt says. Potentes potenter tormenta
pacient^. They that be mighty in this world by wealth and worship that god
sends them / shall suffer mighty tourmentes / if they be unkind. Also for
the sin repugneth more to his person / both for his dygnyte and for the vow
of his chastyte that he made in taking of holy order. Not for defaute of the
sacrament. For the sacrament is not the worse for the malice of the preeste.
But therefore this law forbyddeth men to here there masses and there office /
that they might so be ashamed of there sin and the sooner amend them. Dives.
When is a man of holy church called in the law an open notorye lechoure.
Pauper. When the deed shows so themself that it may not be denied ne excused
or when he is aknowen it for a Judge or conuycte thereof before his Judge. Extra
e. ca. vestra. et ca. quesitum. When it is thus notorye and open there should
no man ne woman here their masses ne their office wetyngly. Such clerks
lechours / be he priest / be he bishop / be he deken or subdeken / he should
lose his degree and not abide in the chau^sell among other clerks in time of
office / and he should have no part of the goods of holy church.
Distinc.lxxxi.si ^s cu^ alijs capitulis sequentibus. And therefore saint Gregory
byddeth in the name of god by the auctoryte of saint Peter that no priest
lechoure / ne deken ne subdeken lechour should enter holy church till that
they would amend them. And no man ne woman says he be so herdy to here their
office. For why he says their blessing tourneth in to cursynge / and their
prayer in to sin. For god says to them. I shall curse your blessings. And
all tho says he that will not obey to this holy commandment / they fall in
sin of ydolatrye. Distinc.lxxxij.si qui sunt. Therefore god says to wicked
men of holy church / but ye will here me and set your hertes to worship my
name / else I shall send to you myscheef and curse your blessings. Malachie

Dives. Whether is lecherye more sin in wedded folk / or in men of holy
church. Pauper. In lecherye be many degrees as I said before. For auoutrye is
more sin than is simple fornycacyon But inceste that is lechery with them
that be nyghe of kynne / is more than auoutrye. And sacrylege that is lecherye
in them that have auowed chastyte as in men of holy church / and in men of
relygyon also / is more than auoutrye. Hec lu^. ^fes. li. iij.ti.xxxiiij.q^.
CC. pri.^quero. Where he says that sacrylege and brekynge of the vow of
chastyte / is more than auoutrye. And also his sin is more grievous / for it
is more sclaunderous and noyous to the people / for his wicked ensample. And
therefore saint Gregorye says that they shall answer for as many souls as
perysshe by their wicked ensample. For when the head and the leder falls /
the body lightly shall fall. And more dyscomforte it is to an oost if they
see their chefteyne flee / and turn the back / than though they see twenty
other simple men turn the back and flee / and more confort to the enmyes And
so it is of men of holy church that should be leders of christian people For
they turn the back to god and flee out of gods oost as often as they fall
in dedely sin. Also it is more grievous in men of holy church / for they may
better flee lecherye than me^ of the world. For it needs not them not much
dele with wymen / ne with the world / ne it longs not to them But it
longs to them to flee the company of wymen and every occasyon of sin. Vide

Dives. Why be men yrreguler for bygamye. Pauper. For many causes. First for
dygnyte and honest of holy order / and of the sacraments of holy church.
Also to she we token and example of contynence and of chastyte. Distinc.xxxij.
posuisti. For he that shall preche contynence and chastyte / must show
contynence and chastyte in himself. Also for there is not full sacrament of
matrymonye. And he that shall mynystre the sacraments of holy church / must
have no defaute in any sacrament. Wherefore thou shall understand as I said
first. The sacrament of matrymonye betokens the unity and the knot between
christ and holy church / as between one husbonde and one wife maiden without
spot. As saint Poule says / and that is betokened by the coniunccyon and
knyttynge to gydre bodily of husbonde and wife in matrymonye. Also yt bodily
knyttynge to gydre in matrymonye betokens the unity and the knot between the
godhede and the manhede in the chamber of the maid Marye / which knot and
unity and matrymonye began in time of patryarkes and prophets / and it was
made seker and stable in the time of grace in the birth of christ and his
passion. But it shall be full ends and made parfyght in heaven bliss. And
therefore layth laynt An^^en in questionibus Orosij. That as god made woman of
the ryb of Adam slepyng and of his side / so out of the side of christ
slepynge upon the cross ran blood and water / which be the sacraments of
our redempco^n / by which sacraments holy church is fourmed and wedded to
christ as Eve to Adam. Also matrymonye betokens the unity and the knot
between christ and christian soul / and that pryncypaly for the goostely knot
that is between the husbonde and wife in assent of there wylles. For as much
than as he that is in bygamye is not only one husbonde to one clean wife / as
christ is one husbonde to one holy church maiden. Or the wife is not only wife
bodily to one husbonde / but the husbonde has departed his flesh in two
wives / or the wife departed her flesh in two men / therefore there is defaute
in that sacrament of matrymonye. For it sygnefyeth not perfyghtly the unity
between christ and holy church. And in many manner man falls in bygamye and
so in yrregularyte. First if he have two wives lawfully one after an other and
knows them flesshly. Also if he have two to gydre or mo / as one by the law
openly and by dome of holy church / and an other by law of conscience and
know them flesshely. Also if he have two on yt manner one after a another and
knows them flesshly. Also if he have wedded a wedowe corrupt. Also if he
wedde any woman corrupt of an other man / where he knows her corrupt or
knows it not. Also if he knew flesshely his own wife after that she is
know of a another / whether he knows it or knows it not. Also if any man of
holy church or professed in relygyon wedde a woman and meddle with her / be she
maid or corrupt / he is yrreguler. Versus. Si ducas inducam. vel qua^
corruperit alter. Vnam post alia^. binas que simul tua coniunx. Cognita si
fuerit. bigamie lege teneris. Et si pollicitam. violasti virginitatem. In all
these cases man is yrreguler. Dives. Though the man be not maid when he
weddeth a maid / is he not yrreguler for his own corrupco n / why is he than
yrreguler for corrupco^n of the woman. For it seems that his own corrupcyon
should rather make him yrreguler / than the corrupco^n of the woman. Pauper In
the coniunccyon of christ to holy church is unity and onehede in both parts.
And therefore if either man or woman in matrymonye has departed his flesh
before / there is a defaute in that matrymonye / as anentes that sacrament. For
there matrymonye betokens not parfyghtely the matrymonye between christ and
holy church. But more onehede and clennesse is needful in the woman than in
the man. For in the man it is need full yt he have wedded no woman by fore
flesshely but one / but it needs not yt he be a maid / but in the woman it is
nedeful yt she be not corrupt before of any other man. Dives. By what reason.
Pauper. For the corrupcyon of matrymonye causes not yrregularyte in him that
is corrupt / but it causes yrregularyte in the other yt is knytte to him. For
that deed of corrupcyon falls not than on him that did the deed / but on him
that is knyt to him in matrymonye. And therefore right as the man is not
yrreguler for he is corrupt himself when he weddeth / but for he weddeth a
woman corrupt / right so if woman were able to holy order / she should be
yrreguler / not for that she is corrupt / but for that she knytteth her to a
man corrupt / but she had be corrupt before in other matrymonye. An other
reason may be this. For the knot and unity made between christ and holy church
/ and between the godhede and the manhede / it is one and ones made for ever.
Therefore it is betokened by the bodily knyttynge to gydre of the first
matrymonye But when man passes to the second wife and weddeth also bodily /
or if she be corrupt / than gooth he from unity to pluralyte. Therefore the
second matrymonye may not figure parfyghtly the coniunccyon of christ to holy
church / ne of the godhede to the manhede / which coniunccyon is one / and
but ones done for ever / and not chau^geable. For there the thing betokened is
but one / the thynhe betokenynge that thing must be one. And the thing
betokened and ye thing betokenynge yt thing must be like. Also more
clennesse is nedeful to the woman to save the sacrament of matrymony than in y^
man / for the woman betokens holy church wedded to christ / which as saint
Poule says must be clean maid without spot. Also the woman betokens manhede
of christ that he took of the maid Marye without part of man. Also the woman
betokens christian soul which must be without corrupco^n of sin if it
shall be crystus spouse. For these resons / to save the sacrament of matrymonye
/ y^ woman must be maiden Dives. I suppose a man had defouled a maiden / and
after that he wedded her / is he yrreguler for he weddeth that woman so
corrupt. Pauper. Some clerks say ye and some nay But yt most common opinion
is that he is not yrreguler / for he departed not his flesh in to an other
wife / so that the maiden be not defouled of a another. Dives. Saint Poule
says. Oportet presbiterum ee^ vnius vxoris virum ^. ad Thy.iij. It behooves a
priest to be husbonde of one wife. And so it seems yt every priest must have
a wife or else he may be no priest / and so thersholde no preeste dwell
maiden. Pauper. The words of saint Poule be thus to understand. That there
may no man be priest yt has had two wives bodily. For than is he bygamus.
Dives. What if a man wene to wedde a maid and he find her corrupt. Pauper. He
is yrreguler And if he wedde a maid and she meddle after with any other man /
and her husbonde meddle with her after yt she is known of an other / though
the husbonde wit it not / yet he is yrreguler And if a man accuse his wife of
auoutrye and he meddle with her after / yt by his one axynge or by his wives
axynge he is yrreguler / be she gylty be she not gylty. And by common opinion
though he be compelled by holy church to yield to her the det of his body /
if he yield it he is yrreguler. If a man wedde a maiden / and she dye a maiden
/ and after that he wedde another maiden and know her flesshely or if he know
the first and not the second / in this case he is not yrreguler for he
departs not his flesh in two wives / ne his wife in two men. And if he
wedde a wedowe maid / he is not yrreguler. If a man has made a contracte with
a woman and after weddeth an other and knows her flesshly if he know not the
first flesshely / he is not yrreguler. But if he be compelled by holy church
to go again to yt first / anon as he yeldeth her the de^ of his body he is
yrreguler. If a man have two wives before his baptem / or one before / and on
other after bodily he is yrreguler. He yt is bygamus shall have no Joy of any
preuylege yt longs to the clergy / and be suget to other seculer Iuges as
other lewd men. And upon pain of cursynge he shall bear no tonsure / ne use
clothing that longs to clergy. In s^. conf.li.iij ti. de bigame.

And therefore they that call them hethen wymen for the time that they lie in
be folys and sin in case full greuou s;ly. Dives. May a man give his wife leave
to meddle with an other man / or the wife give the husbonde leave to meddle with
an other woman. Pauper. Nay. For neither may give other leave to do dedely sin
ayenste the commandment of god. No^ mechaberis. Ne the pope himself may give
them leave. Dives Contra We read Gen^.xvi. That Sara the wife of Abraham gaaf
Abraham leave to meddle with Agar her servant to get on her a child and so he
did / for he begat on her Ysmaell. Pauper To this clerks say yt Abraham was
excused. For it was the manner among the good people of god yt time that if the
wife were bareyne / by there both assent yt husbonde might take him a
secondarye wife / not for lust / but only to multeplye gods people. And so
Abraham by assent of his wife and by the preuy leave of god / not for lust /
but for to have a child to gods worship took Agar to his wife. And so she
was his secondarye wife / and Sara the cheef wife. And also so had Jacob four
wives lefully not for lust. but for to multeplye gods people / and for token
of things that were to come. And that was do by auctoryte of dyspensacyon of
god / which is above al laws. But though god dyspen s;ed with Abraham and
Sara to do in that manner / or with Jacob to have many wives to gydre / for
figure and resons that god knew / yet men may not take now this time example
thereof to do the same. For the reasons before said be fulfilled. And the law
says. Priuilegiu paucorum no^ facit legem commune^.xxv.q^.i.ca. vltimo prope
finem. The preuylege of a few makes no common law. And therefore Ysaac the sone
of Abraham had never but one wife that was Rebecca / of which he bygate but
two childern at one time as says saint Austen. And he meddled never with other
woman for desire of childern / ne for lust of his flesh. And so by his
contynence he shows yt his faders doing was but a special preuylege
granted of god to him / and therefore in that he took non example thereof. For
that Abraham did / he did it by specyal dyspensacyon of god / and in figure
of things to come. For by his servant Agar / and his sone Ysmael is
understand the old testament and the Jews and all that lyuen after the
flesfhe and in dedely sin. By Sara and her sone Ysaac is stnderstande the
new testament and folk of the new law that is christian people that lyuen
goostly out of dedely sin. And that Abraham at the byddyng of god drove out
either put out of household his servant and his child when Sara had born her
sone Ysaac / betokens that in time of grace when the new testament that is
the new law and christian people began / than the old law should be put
away / and the Jews put from the household of heaven / but they would be
converted. And also that all that lyuen after the flesh and in dedely sin /
shall be put out of gods household / but they amend them.

Dives. I have often herd said that fendes in man's likeness have layen by
wymen and made them with child. and that is wonderful to me. For the fend
is but a spyryte / and has neither flesh ne bone / ne any thing of mankind
whereby yt he should gendre with woman. Pauper: The fend by suffraunce of god
may sad the air and make him a body of the air in what likeness god
suffers him / in so much yt as says saint Poule. He transfygureth himself
in to an angel of light. Much more than he may transfygure him in to
likeness of man or woman by suffrau^ce of god / for man's sin and woman's.
And the fendes that tempt folk to lecherye be most besye to appear in man's
likeness and woman's to do lecherye with folk and so bring them to lecherye.
And in speech of folk they be called eluys. But in latin when they appear in
man's lykenes they be called Incubi. And when they appear in lykenes of wymen
/ they be called Succubi. And for they have no matter ne sede of themself to
gendre therefore they gendre and take the superfluyte of the matter and sede of
man that passes from man slepynge and other times / and with that matter they
meddle with wymen. Also they gadre matter and sede of woman / and with that meddle
with man in woman's likeness. And of such medlynge as god suffers comen
sometime good childern / sometime wicked / sometime well shapen / sometime evil
shapen. But needs one must be man or woman / for fend with fend may not
gendre. Such fendes be most besye to shende wymen. And therefore it is
peryllous to wymen that desyren much man's company / to be ouermoche
solytarye without honest company. And such foul spyrytes do therlecherye in
this manner / not only with man and woman / but also with unreasonable bestes /
and appear to them in likeness of bestes / as a bole to kyne / and as a ram to
sheep. And so by the fendes doing come many of these mysshape things that be
borne both of wymen and of bestes / as a calfe with an adders tail / a child
with an adders head / a child borne of a sheep with wolle in the neck. All
these have fallen in our days.

Caplm.xxij.
Dives. It may be well as y^ say / but I pray the tell me what is goostly
fornycaco^n / gostly auoutre / and lechery. Pauper All three be take for one /
and pryncypally it is called ydolatrye / when man or woman withdraws his love
and his trust fro god and sets it more in creatures than in god / and the
worship that longs to the godhede does it to creatures / thanking creatures
of the benefyces that only god may do. And so the worship yt longs only
to god / they give it to creatures / stock or stone / man or woman / or to
images made with man's hondes / that neither may see / here / ne help at
need. When man or woman is crystened / his soul is wedded to christ by right
believe and true love and charity that he behoteth there to god to keep his
byhestes and to forsake the fend. But after when he forsakes god and gods
byhestes / and tourneth him to the fend by his own fyndynges of mys lusts
and leueth the love of christ for the love of any creature than he does goostly
lecherye with the fend. And therefore says Dauyd / yt they have do fornycaco n
in there own fyndynges. And on this manner all flesshely thought and al mys
lust and unrightful doing and unlawful couetyse in that it withdraws the
love of man or of woman fro god it is called goostly fornycaco^n and auoutrye.
And thus every dedely sin is called goostly auoutrye and goostely fornycacyon
/ but pryncypaly ydolatrye and forsakynge of the faith. Also false prechynge /
and false exposyco^n of holy wryt is called spyrytuell fornycacyon. As they
that preche pryncypaly to please the people and to get a name / or to get
temporal good. Of such says laynt Poule. That they put gods word in
auoutrye. Adulterantes verbu^ dei.ij.ad Little.iiij. For there the should use it
to the worship of god / and to the proufyte of man's soul they use it to there
own worship and to there own worldely proufyte and to pleasaunce of the fend
/ and harm of man's soul. Also false couetyse is called goostly fornycacy
on. Therefore saint James says to false couetyse men. Adulteriu^ nescitis quia
amicicia huius mundi inimicicia est deo. Iacobi.iiij. Ye auouterers and
lechours / wit ye not that frendshyp of this world is enmye to god. Therefore
in the book of gods preuytees / couetyse and pomp of this world / and
covetous and proud people is called the cite of Babylon / that is to say the
cite of shenshyp. And it is lykened to a common woman / with which kings
princes lords merchants and all couetouse folk have do lecherye / and it
is called mother of fornycacyons and of abhomyncyons. For as saint Poule says.
Couetyse is rote of all wyckednesses. And therefore god byddeth there that his
people should go out of the cite of Babylon That is to say / forsake sinful
company / and forsake lust of the flesh and pomp and couetyse of this
world that makes men to forsake god and do goostly lecherye with the fend.
wend ye out says god fro this wicked Babylon / and forsake this wicked common
woman of lust and of false couetyse that desceyueth all this world For in one
day shall come all her destruccyon / and that shall be endeles death weeping and
hongre without end / and there shall be brennynge fire and smoder without
end. And than all yt have do goostly lecherye and lived in delyces and false
couetyse shall weep and says Ve ve. alas alas. Apo.xvij.et.xviij.

Dives. All though thy speech de reasonable / yet in one thing clerks hold
against the in that that thou say that the sin of Adam was more than the
sin of Eve. And they argue thus against the God ryghtfull Judge punysshed Eve
hard for her sin than he did Adam for his sin / but yt should not god have
do / but for her sy^ne was more grievous than y^ sin of Adam / therefore the
sin of Eve was more grievous than Adams sin. Pauper. This argument is
grounded in two false maximis. First that every punysshynge and vengeance
assygned of god for man's sin and woman's is assygned after yt the sin is
more or less. And this maxim and ground is false / wherefore thou shall
understand that god punysshe some sin in this world / and some in the other
world some both here and there. In the other world he punyssheth every sin
after that it is more grievous / or less grievous. But in this world he does
not always so. But often in this world he punyssheth the less sin harder than
he does the more sin. Therefore in the old law auoutrye was punysshed as
hard or hard than manslaughter / and yet manslaughter is more grievous sin
than auoutrye / and god took more temporal vengeu^ce in this world for
lecherye / than ever he did for ydolatrye / and yet ydolatrye is gretter sin
than lechery / for it is in medyat against god and against y^ first commandment
of the first table. And manslaughter is harder punysshed in this world than
periurye / and yet periurye is gretter sin / as I said in y^ second
commandment. And sins in simple poor folk be harder punysshed in this
world / than sins of the great men. If a poor man stele an horse / he shall
be hanged. But if a lord by raueyn and extorcyons rob a man of all y^ he
has / he shall not be hanged ne little or naught punysshed in this world.
Dauyd did auoutre and man slaughter / for which sin he was worthy to be
slain by common law of god / and yet god would not have hy^ slain / but if a
poor man had do tho sins / he should have be slain. A simple man went and
gadred styckes in the sabot / and god had Moses stone hy^ to death. Solomon
Jeroboam Acham did great ydolatrye / and drough much of the people to
ydolatrye / and yet were they not slain / therefore the smaller sins god
punysshed in this world yt the souls be punysshed in this world so yt the
souls of the sinners may be saved if they take it pacyently / and commonly he
punysshed hard poor folk in this world than the rich folk as by common
law. For the sin of great men / as in y^ same spyce of sin is more grievous
than is the sin of the poor man. And therefore god reserueth the grievous
sins and the sins of great folk for to punysshe them in the other world /
or in hell or in purgatory. There may no temporal pain be full punysshynge
for dedely sin save contrycyon allone. And therefore god punyssheth not always
folk in this world after the qua^tyte of there sin / but as he sees it
most needful and spedefull to y^ people and to his worship. For only god
knows the greuoushede of dedely sin. For often yt yt seems most grievous in
man's sight / is less grievous in gods sight / and ayenwarde. Therefore god
melureth not always pain after the quantyte of the sin. But often he
punyssheth in this world them that be less gylty / as much as them that be
more gylty. And in time of the flood of Noe / and in the pery s;shynge of Sodom
and Gomor / and many other times he punysshed wymen childern and bestes that
were not gylty in the sins for which that vengeance fell. And often he
sends sykenes and disease to good men / in punysshyng of there sins in this
world / and suffers shrewes to have there will / and little or naught puny
s;sheth them in this world. And as the lion is chastysed by betynge of the
whelpe / so oftyme god punyssheth and chastyseth full hard in this world them
that be less gylty / to warn the^ that be more gylty that they should amend
them. Therefore christ said to the Jews / wene ye yt tho men which Py^at
slough for their rebellyon were gretter sinners than other folk of the contre.
Nay forsooth. But I say to you forsooth / but ye amend you / ye shall perysshe
all. And wene ye says christ that the.xviij. men upon which fell the toure
of Syloa in Ierlm and slough them / wene ye that they passed in sin all the
men of Jerusalem. Nay forsooth. But I say to you but ye amend you / ye shall
perysshe all to gydre. Luce.xiij. And so the punysshynge of tho men so slain
was a warning to them that were more sinful that they should amend them.
And so thou myghtest well see that thy reason is naught worthy / god punysshed
Eve harder in this world than he did Adam / therefore her sin was more than
the sin of Adam.

Caplm.xxiiij.
ALso the second maxim and ground in which thou sayste that god punysshed
Eve harder than Adam may resonably be denied. For in punysshynge of Adam god
gaf his curse and said. Cursed be the earth in thy work and in thy sin He
said not cursed be the earth in thy work of Eve / ne he said not / cursed be
the earth in your work / as for common sin of them both / but he said only
to Adam. Cursed be y^ earth in thy work. In punysshynge also of the serpent he
gaf his curse and said Thou shall be cursed among all thing living upon
earth. Also god cursed Caym when he punysshed hy^ for sleynge of his brother
Abell. But when god punysshed woman / he gave not his curse. And we read not
that ever god gave his curse to any woman openly in specyaall. Ne god repreued
not Eve so much as he did Adam. And so the great repreue and blaming and the
curse yt god gave in punysshyng of Adam more than he did in punysshyng of Eve /
showing well yt the sin of Adam was more grievous than was the sin of Eve /
and yt there was more ob^tynacy in Adam than was in Eve. For cursyng is not
given of god ne of holy church / but for obstynacy. As I said first Adam
answered full obstynatly. God blamed Adam pry^cypaly for brekyng of his
commandment and said to him yt brekynge of his commandment was cause of his
nakedness and of his sudden myscheef / and notwithstange the techynge and the
styrynge of god he would not be aknowen of his sin / but put his sin on god
/ and excused him by Eve / and so put sin to sin in excusacyon of his
sin. When god punysshed Adam he cursed the earth for his sin / which curse
turned to woo and travail of him and of all mankind which we may not flee.
And therefore ha said to Adam / thou shall ete of the earth in travail and
sorrow all the days of thy life. I shall bring the forth brerys and thorns /
and thou shall ete herbs of the earth. Also in punysshynge of Adam god gaf the
sentence of death upon hy^ and all mankind for his sin. And therefore god said
to Adam / you shall ete thy bread in swynke and sweet of thy face till you turn
again in to the earth. For earth you art / and in to earth again thou shall wend.
Sythen than god for the sin of Adam gaf so grievously his curse / and blamed
so hard Adam of his sin / and for his sin dampened him and all mankind /
and punysshed all erthely creatures for his sin and dampened him and all man
kind to perpetuel travail when he said. Thou shall ete thy mete with travail
and sorrow all the days of thy life. And also for the sin of Adam he gaf
sentence of death to him and to all mankind that is most of all pains / it
follows that god punysshed harder Adam for his sin / than he did Eve for
her sin. For why in punysshynge of Eve god repreued her not so much as he
did Adam. and he gaf than no curse ne pain perpetuell save subieccyon. I
shall said god multeplye thy myscheues and thy conceyuynges / and in sorrow you
shall bear thy childern / and you shall be under power of man and he shall be
thy lord. God said not to woman. I shall multeplye thy myscheues all days of
thy life. For she may keep her chaste if she will and flee myscheef and pain
of childern birth. And that god made woman suget to man for the sin of Eve /
it was no new thing to woman. For as saint Austen says super
Gen^.li.xi.ca.xiiij. Woman was suget to man before by order of kind / but that
subiecco^n was only by love and charity / but for her sin she was made suget
/ not only by love / but also by need and bondage of honest seruyle works to
obey to man and be under his governance. Before her sin she was sugette to
man only by love / but after her sin she was made suget to man / not only by
love but by dread and by need. For she must dread man and she has need of his
help. For yt was the pride of Adam and of Eve / that they desired to have no
sovereign ne governor but god allone as clerks say. And therefore ye fend in
gyle behyght them yt they desired saying to Eve if ye ete of ye tree yt god
has forbode you ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil / that is to
say / ye shall need no sovereign ne governor to teache you ne to govern you
but god / and for that they desired it lyghtely they byleued it. For as the
master of stories says. A thing that is desired / lightly it is byleued. And
therefore god ryghtfull Judge punysshed them both in subieccyon of dread and of
need / and of hard seruage. He made woman suget to man / and afterward he
made man suget and thrall to man for the sin of Adam as says saint Austen
super Gen^.v. sup. More than ever he made woman suget to man. For the sin of
Eve as says saint Austen super Gen^.v.s. For though woman be in thraldom to
temporell lords as be men / yt is not for ye sin of Eve / but pryncypaly for
the sin of Adam. The subiecco^n yt woman is put in for y^ sin of Eve / is
the subiecco^n yt the wife ought to her husbonde. And all the soueraynte and
lordshyp that any man has here in this world / either over man or woman / it
is meddled with much woo and great sorrow and care. For every sovereign in this
world must care for his sugettes if he be wise. And in higher degree that he
be of lordshyp and of dygnyte / in the higher degree is he of peril / of dread
/ of sorrow / and care in punysshyng of Adams sin. And so both lordshyp in
this world and subiecco n be punysshed of Adams sin And if sugettes can have
pacyence with their degree / they be in more sykernes both of body and of soul
/ and in more gladness of heart than be the souerayns And so punysshed god Adam
as much in manner / in that he made him lord and governor of woman as he
punysshed Eve when he made her suget to Adam. For in that god bond man to have
cure of woman in her myscheef to save her and to keep her that was by common so
faynte / so feeble and freell / and so myschyuous by cause of her sin.

Caplm.xxv.
Dives. Yet clerks argue against the and say yt woman sinned more grievously
than Adam / for she put hyrself in sy^ne and her husbonde Adam / but Adam put
only himself in sin. Pauper This reason is naught. For as I said first Adam
was shent with preuy pride and wealth of himself and fell in to sin or Eve
pro^ced him y^ apple. Also says saint Austen de ci.dei.li.xiiij.ca.xi. Adam
wyste well yt it was a grievous sin / but Eve was so desceyued that she wend
yt it had be no sin. And therefore the sin that she did by Ignorau ce and
desceyte of the fend excuses not / ne lesseth not the sin of Adam yt he did
willing and wyttyngly Adam was her sovereign and should have governed them
both and not obey to the voice of his wife against the voice of god that
forbadde him the tree. Example / if a simple man be uncunning / and by
desceyte of some shrewe do a folly wenynge not to do amys / and he come to his
prelate or his bishop and counseyll him to do the same / and his prelate or
his bishop do the same wetynge well that he does amys / and that it is a
greuouse sin / every man will deem that the bishop and his prelate synneth
more grievously than the simple man that wend not to do amys. And thus nyghe
all circumstau^ces tha^ aggreggen any sin aggregged the sin of Adam more
than y^ sin of Eve For he was sovereign and parfyght more in kind / wyser
and myghtyer to withstand the fendes fodynge / and with less temptaco^n fell
in sin and brake gods commandment wityngly / but Eve by desceyte of the
adder sinned by Ignorance. As says saint Austen vbi su^ proxi^o. et Ysydorus
de su^^ bono li.ij. Eve yield her culpable. Adam did not so. Eve wend not
have sinned. Adam wetyngly sinned in hope of forgyuenesse. As saint Austen
says and the master of sentence li.ij.di.xxij. And so Adam sy^ned in hope and
presumpco^n against the holy ghost / and this is a full grievous sin as christ
shows in y^ gospel. M^ xij. Quicu^que dixerit verbu ^tra spiritum sanctu^
no^ remitte^ ei and^. Where the gloss says. That they yt sin by Ignorance
may lightly have forgyuenesse / but he yt does it wetyngly against the mageste
of god against his conscience / he is worthy no forgyuenesse. Also Adam was
more obstynat than Eve was. Dives. Show me that. Pauper. For god blamed hy^
first of all / and declared to him his sin / and god abode of punysshynge
till he had vndernomen Eve / and after Eve the fend in the adder / and first
he punysshed the adder / and than Eve that Adam should have beware and axed
mercy. And so god blamed him first and punysshed hy^ last / so gyuyng him
respyte to repentance. But for all this Adam repented him not / ne wol de axe
mercy ne low him. First god punysshed him fro fer in y^ adder in that yt he
cursed the adder yt was his suget and made the adder enmye to his wife and to
her sede / yt is to say to there childern yt she should get of Adam / and so
god made the adder that was before suget and meke to him rebel and enemy to
his love yt was his wife and to al yt should come of them two / yet Adam stood
obstynat. Than god punysshed Eve his wife his love his help / and so punysshed
hy^ in Eve / for if he loved her so much as clerks say / it should have be to
him full great pain to see his wife his love so punysshed. For as clerks say /
the great love yt he had to Eve made him to break y^ commandment of god. And
yet now a days it is full great pain to kind folk true in love to see there
love and their friends in sorrow and disease. Also god punysshed Adam and Eve
in that yt he punysshed her with myscheues of sykenesse / freelte and
feblenesse. For in so much god took from him his help that was woman made to
be man's help. But the more feeble that god made her for sin / the less she
might help man. Also god punysshed them both anon as Adam ete of the tree /
and made them so naked and so unhonest that they were ashamed of themself /
which pain fell not to Adam ne to Eve till Adam had ete of y^ apple. And
notwithstanding all this / yet Adam stood obstynate and axed no mercy ne
knowleged no sin. And than god ryghtfull Judge punysshed him full hard both
in this world and in the other world / and punysshed all mankind for his
sin. As saint Poule says and saint Austen and other doctoures. God punysshed
Adam and mankind full hard for his sin / when he took much of his lordshyp
a way from him and made nyghe all creatures rebelle to him / and brought him
so low in order of kind / yt though by way of kind man before Adams sin
passes woman in virtue and perfeccnn of kind. Now after Adames sin woman
often time passes many men in virtue and in dyscrecy on / and in other gifts
both of kind and of grace. And before the sin of Adam / man was so
sovereign to woman / that woman should not have be his sovereign. But now for
Adams sin oftentimes man is suget to woman as to his lady by bondage and
thraldom / by hard seruage / by need and dread / and ought more seruage and
subieccyon to woman for Adams sin / than does woman to man for the sin of
Eve For god made woman for the sin of Eve only suget to her husbonde in
service of honest works as fellow not as chorle in works of worldly bondage.
Also man for the sin of Adam is ordained to many more perils both on land
and on water / and to war and to woo / and business of this world / and to
much travail and to many perils more than woman is ordained to. Dives. I
have wondre that any clerk should hold against the in this matter of Adams
sin. Pauper. Clerks speak often by opinion in this matter and other matters also
/ and not always afferme that they say to the vttermoste / but put it in the
dome of other clerks if they can say better. And so do I now at this time /
if any clerk can say more skylfully reasons.

Here ends the sixthe commandment. And begins the seuenthe commandment.
Capitulum Primu^.
Dives. I thank the for thou have well declared to me the sixth commandment.
Now I pray the enfourme you me in the seuenthe commandment. Pauper. The
seventh commandment is this. Non furtum facies. That is to say. Thou shall
do no theeft / neither in will / ne in deed as the gloss says. And so by this
commandment is forboden all manner mys taking and all manner false with
holding and withdrawynge of other men's good against there will / and all the
menes that led to theeft be also forboden by this commandment / as false
weyghtes / false mesures / falls oaths / gylous speech / gyle in craft / and
gyle in chafayre / false werkmanshyp and faint labor in laborers that taken
great hyre and do little therefore. Also raueyns extorcyoners / false
withholdynge of det and of men's hyres / and falls withholdyng of man's right
and woman's / and lettynge of there right. All these be forboden by this
commandment. And so by this commandment is forboden all manner theeft both
bodily and goostly. Dives. What is bodily theeft. Pauper. As says Reymu
de.li.ij.ti.de furtis. Bodily theeft is a gylous and unlawful treating and
using of an other man's good meuable against the will of the lord that ought
the thing to get the thing in themself to his auau^tage / or to have the
use of the thing for a time or for to hyde it for a time and deny the
possessyon though he think to make restytucyon. And thus some is open theeft /
and some is preuy theeft. Open theft is when the thief is taken with his
pelfere or conuycte by true witness of theeft / and such theeft is punysshed
by lands law and by holy chirches law. Some is do so preuely that the thief
may not be take therewith ne conuycte. And such may not be punysshed openly by
no law / but only preuely by law of conscience in the dome of his confessor
which is bound to cou^seylle and to save his name and his fame. And as the
law says / every unlawful using and taking of other man's good meuable or
not meuable / is theeft.xiiij.q^.v. penale. et xxxij.q^.iiij meretrices. For as
the law says there / god that forbyddeth theeft forbyddeth raueyne.

Caplm.ij.
ALso leave friend ye shall understand that as holy wryt wytne s;seth / there is
theeft and robberye of man's name and woman's / and that is called bacbytynge
and defamynge / through which man and woman le seth his good name. And
therefore the wise man says. Ne appelleris susur to in vita tua. Eccl.v. Be
thou not called a musterer ne preuy bacbyter in thy life / be you not take false
in thy tongue that you be not shent for to yt theeft that stele a man's good
name / there to is ordained much shame and much pain and full wicked
dampnacyon is to the double tonged man and woman and to musterers and preuy
bachyters is hate and enmyte and despyte. Eccl.v. For this manner of theeft is
full great and grievous. For as Solomon says. Melius est nome^ bonu^ quam
diuicie multe et super auru^ and argentu^ gracia bona A good name is better
than many rychesses / and good grace of good love passes gold and silver.
Prouer.xxij. For the best Jewel and most rychesses that man or woman may
have upon earth / is to have a good name and love and grace among his
neighbors and in the contre. And therefore bacbyters lesyngmongers and wicked
spekers yt rob man or woman of there good name and bring them in wicked name
and fame / they be the worst thieves upon the earth / and they may not be
assoyled of this theeft but they do there devour upon there power / to restore
man or woman there good name and fame / that they have wyckedly robbed of them.
And therefore says the law / that they yt with bacbytynge destroy the good
name and the good life and the good thewes of other folk be worse thieves than
be they that rob men of there goods and of there (...) vi.q^.i. de^iores. And
in the next chaptre / the law says / that bacbytynge is a full great
wickedness. For who so bacbyteth his brother he is a mansleer / and there
shall no such thief ne mansleer have part in the kingdom of heaven. And
therefore the law says in an other place that it profyteth not as anentes mede
in heaven a man to fast or to pray or to do other good deeds of relygyon but
his thoughts be withdrawn fro wickedness and his tongue fro bachytynge. De
condici.v. nichil em^ prode^t. And not only he is gylty in bachytynge yt
speaks evil of his even christian but also tho yt gladly here such wicked
speech and shrewde tales of there even christian.vi. q^.i. e^ merito.xxi.q^.iij.
no^ solum. And therefore y^ wise man says / put away fro the y^ wicked mouth /
and put away fer fro the lyppes bachytynge. Prou^. iiij. Hegge thyn eeres with
thorns / and here not the wicked tongue / and make doors to thy mouth / and
locks to thyn eeres. Eccl.xxviij. Think that he will speak of the as evil
behind the / as he does of an other behind him. Think what woe and myscheef
comes of bachytynge and wicked tongues / and show him no good chere / but
show him by thy contenau^ce and thy chere yt his speech pleases the not and
anon he shall cesse and be ashamed of his malice. For y^ wise man says Right
as the northen wind destroy de and scatereth the rain and y^ clouds / so the
heavy face of the herer destroyed the bachytynge tongue. Prouer.xxv. The
childeren of Israel bacbyte^ gods doing / and lacked the land of byheste
when they should have entered and god was offended with them / and badde them
goo again bacwarde in to deser^e and there he held them.xl. year tylle they
were deed ever ychone that came out of Egypt / save two men Iosue and Caleph.
For they two spoke good of the land of byheste / and held with god. And so
the childeren of the people that came out of Egypt entered the land of byheste
/ and not y^ fads save Iosue and Caleph / and y^ for there bacbytynge.
Nume.xiiij. Also Mary the sister of Moses bacbyted her brother Moses and
spoke evil of him / and anon she was a foul lepre and might not be heled
till Moses prayde to god for her. Numeri.xij.

Caplm.iij.
ALso there is theeft of words of which theeft god speaks by the prophet
Ieremi.xxiij. Where god vndernemeth false prophets and false prechours which
stale away his words fro the people and told not the truth as god badd them
but only said such things that shall please the people and so desceyue the
people with lesynges and with false miracles / as men do now a days faynynge
miracles of images as men do now a days to maynten ydolatrye for lucre of
offrynge and false miracles of wicked lyuers / and say yt god does miracles
for them / and so blynden the people in falsenesse. And so they give the
worship of miracles doing to images yt man has made / and to wicked lyuers
gods enemies which miracles only god may do / and so rob god of his
worship. And in that they withdraw gods word and the truth to gods law
yt longs to men of holy church to teache / and to the people to can and to
know. And so they desceyue the people in yt they be thieves of gods word /
and shall be punysshed full hard of god for such theeft of gods word For
god says to every prelate curate and prechour. Speculatorem dedi te domin
israel etc. I have made the a day wait to the household of Israel and to my
people / and you shall here my word of my mouth / and show it and tell it in
my name to them. If I say to the wicked man y^ he shall dye for his
wickedness. And y^ tellest him not but hydest my word / and spekeste not to
him that he may turn him from his wickedness and leave it / that wicked man
shall dye in his wickedness / and I shall seek the blood and the death of him
of thyn hand / yt is to say / you shall answer for his death. Eccl.iij. Also
they be thieves of gods words that preche gods words to their own
worldely auantage / not to the worship of god / ne to proufyte of man's
soul. Also they be thieves of gods words that alleggen gods words and
holy wryt falsely to mayntene errors and heresies / or sin or shrewednesse.

Caplm.iiij.
ALso there is a theeft of worldely good. Of such theeft Job says. Agru^ no^
suu^ demetu^t. They repe other men's feldes and make vyntage of there men's
wives / and take men's clothing fro them and late them naked in the cold
winter / and rob moderlesse childern and poor wedowes by might and spoil
and robbed the poor people. The thief says / he ryseth up in the morrow and
sleeth the nedy and y^ poor / and by night he steleth as a mycher. Sed deus
inultu^ abire no^ pati^. Job.xxiiij. Dives How many spyces be there of theeft.
Pauper. Full many. For sometime a thing is stolen preuely without we tynge of
the lord or of the keeper and against there will / and it is called myche rye /
sometime it is do openly by might and vyolence wetynge the lord and the keeper
against there will / and that is proprely rapina raueyn. Sometime it is do wetynge
the lord or the keeper and a part against there will / but not all against there
will under certain condyco^n of winning / not lefull in the taker / and than
it is called vsura / gouel or usure in english. Also al manner unrightful
occupyenge of any thing lordshyppe or any other aver in this world / is
called theeft. And therefore saint Austen says thus. The thing yt man or woman
has by the law yt is his by the law and none other man's And man has by
the law yt he has ryghtfully and he has yt ryghtfully yt he has well. And
therefore says he / every thing that is mys had is other men's / and every
man has his good amys that uses his good amys In epla ad Macedoniu^. Also
withholdynge of alms from the poor nedy folk is theeft in gods sight.
For the covetous rich men withdraw fro the poor folk yt longs to them /
and myspende the poor men's good whereby they should be sustained And therefore
the wise man says. Sone defraude thou not the alms of the poor man / ne
torn not away thine eyes fro the poor / ne despise not the hongry soul / ne
tene ne anger thou not the poor in his myscheue Tourment thou not the heart of
the nedy / ne delay thou not the gift from him that is in anguysshe. Cast
not away the prayer of him that is dyseased / ne turn thou not thy face
away fro the helplese for wrath / ne give you not him that axeth the good none
occasyon to curse the behind the. For if the poor man curse the in
bytternesse of soul / his prayer shall be herd. For he that made him shall
here him. And therefore make the plesaunt in speech to the congregaco^n of poor
folk / and bow thyn eere to the poor without heaviness / and yield thy debt
and answer peasable things and meekness / not to arunt them ne rebuke them
ne chyde them but only thou have the more open cause. Eccl.iiij. Therefore
saint Poule says / that god loved a glad gyuer. Dives. By the law of kind
and by gods law all thing is common. And therefore says the law.xij q^.i.
dilectissimis. Right as the air ne the light of the son may not be departed
by lordshyppes ne apropred more to one person than to an other ne to one
college more than to a another / no more should other things yt be given
commonly to help of mankind be departed by lordshyppes / ne apropred more to
one than to an other but al things should be common. And therefore we read
Actuu^.iiij. That in the beginning of holy church all things were common to
the multitude of christian people. And against law of kind is no dyspensaco^n.
Distinc. xiij.S. i. Why bad god than that men should not stele sith all thing
is common to good men. Pauper. By gods law all thing is common to good men.
For as saint Austen says Oia su^t iustorum. All thyngis be y^ right full
men's. But as y^ law says.xij q^.i. dilectissimis Dyuysyon and properte of
lordshyp is made among mankind by wickedness of false couetyse both of
rich and of poor. For the rich draw to themself yt longs to other. For
why all yt the rich man has passing his honest living after the degree of
his dyspensaco^n / it is other men's and not his. And he shall give full hard
reckoning thereof at the day of dome when god shall say to him. Read racione^
villicaco^^s tue Yield acounte of thy balye. For rich men and lords in this
world be gods balyfes and gods reues to ordeyne for the poor folk and to
sustain them. And therefore says saint Poule. Habentes alime^ta et quibus
tegamur hijs ^tenti simus. If we have nedeful lyuelode and helynge, be we paid
therewith and coueyte we no more. Also poor folk be not paid with suffycyent
living but couete more than them needs. And for couetyse more than for need
take things again the lords will in hindering of him and of other that be
more nedy and should be help thereby. And therefore god forbade all manner theeft
yt men should take no thing for any mys couetyse against the lords will.

Caplm.v.
Dives. Sythen all thing is common by gods law and by law of kind / how
may any (...) be lord of any thing more than an other man. Pauper. There is
lordshyp of kind / and there is lordshyp of this world grounded only in
couese / and there is lordshyp of dyspensaco^n and of governance / and so
Joseph the sone of Jacob was called lord of Egypt. Gen^.xlv. The first
lordshyp is common to every good man and woman. For kind made all men even in
lordshyp. And in token thereof / both lord and servant / free and bound /
rich and poor come in to this world naked and poor and go hens naked and
poor. Naught they bring with them but weeping sob bynge and sorrow. And bear no
thing with them but there good deeds or wicked. The lordshyp of this world is
suffrable and worshypfull. For as saint Poule says. Omnis potestas a deo e^
Every power and lordshyp in this world comes of god. And therefore he byddeth
that every man and woman should be suget and meke to y^ lordshyp above them.
For though the couetyse and wickedness that lords and rich men ground them
in be of themself yet the lordshyp and power is of gods gift. As saint
Austen says / and therefore it must be worshypped. The lordshyp that is only
of dyspensaco^n committed by a sovereign is medefull worshypfull and
commendable. Also there is three manner of propertees and properhede One is that
kind gives / as man to lie. And every man has his own heart / his own
soul / and his own will for to do well or evil / and this properte is
nedeful. An other properte there is / yt comes only of couetyse / by which
couetyse folk say / this is mine and this is thine. And so they propren to
themself by couetyse yt is common by kind. And this propertee so grounded in
couetyse is dampnable and sinful. The third is dyspensaco^n For one man has
much thing in his dyspensacyon and governance / that an other man has
naught to do of. And this dyspensaco^n comes some time of gods gift / as
when he sent one man more riches in this world than an other. Sometime it
comes by ordinance and gift of lords and of soueraynes here in earth. As
when lords and prelates committee to there suget^ governance of there goods of
there places and benefyces. And this dyspensaco^n if it be well do it is full
medeful. Dives. But as saint Poule says. It is a questyon who is found true
among such dyspensours. For nygh al seek there own profit / but not the
worship of Ihesu christ. Pauper. Many be full false / and yet sythen
dyspensacyon of worldely goods is so committed to them / in yt they have
lorshyp of there propre dyspensaco^n ordained of god / and be called propre
lords of there propre dyspensacyon / not for there false couetyse / ne for no
properhede yt they challenge by false couetyse. For in that be they no lords
but tyrau^tes and rauynours. And so though they have propre lordshyp of
dyspensaco^n of worldely goods more than the poor people / they have yet
no more lordshyp by way of kind than the poor man / ne non other lordshyp
than the poor man / but only of dyspensaco^n. And so though the rich folk
have more lordshyp of propre dyspensacyon than the poor / yet the lordshyp of
kind in needful things stands still common to rich and poor. But for
sin it is not so fre as it was byfor y^ sin of Adam For god will not yt the
poor folk take any thing without leave of the propre dyspensatour yt is
called lord thereof / and therefore god said. Non furtu^ facies Thou shall do no
theeft / yt is to say / you shall naught take without thy lords leave. Dives.
This is wonderful to me yt the poor man is as great a lord by way of kind
as the rich / and yet may he naught take with out his leave. Pauper. It is more
wonder yt the good poor man is lord of all thing needful to him by way of
kind / and yt sinful rich man is lord of right naught by way of kind /
for he is gods traitor. And yet god will yt the poor take right naught of
the good yt the rich man has in his dyspensaco^n without leave Dives. That is
to me more wondful / tell me how this may be Pauper Thou might see at eye yt
the kings heir aparant and other heirs of great lordshyppes / not
withstanding that they be heirs and lords of al / yet shall they not enter
the office of there officers / ne take any thing against / ne bear against
without leave. And if they do they shall be hard vndernomen / and in case beat
of there master and of there tutour For fredom in youth is cause of pride and of
many other vices. Right so god seeing yt mankind which is lord of all erthly
goods and ordained to regne in heaven bliss. If he had his fredom in use of
erthely things he should fall in pride and many vices as Adam did while he
was free. Therefore he has put mankind and namely the poor people under yt
governance of the rich folk / and of there lords which be there tutours and
dyspensatours of goods of this world to saluaco^n of the poor people. And
therefore says saint Poule. Quanto tempore here is peruulus est nichil defert a
seruo cu^ sit dn^s omniu^. sed subtutoribus et auctoribus est vsque ad
prefinitu tempus a patre. ad Gala.iiij. As long as the heir is young and
little / there is no dyfference between him and a servant sythen there is a
lord of all / but he is under tutour and governor unto a certain time
ordained of the fader. And therefore sythen the rich folk ben tutours and
dyspensatours of these worldely goods ordained of god to saluaco^n of the
poor people / god will that no man take of the goods that been committed to
them without their will and their leave And if any man take thereof against their
will and against gods ordenau^ce / he does theeft against this commandment.
Non furtu^ facies Thou shall do no theeft.

Dives. Is it lefull in any case to stele and take any thing against the lords
will. Pauper. Stelynge sowneth commonly theeft and robbery / and sometime it
sowneth preuely taking without wyttynge of the lord. And so it may be done in
four cases with out sin. For need / for alms / for right / for hap of
finding. First for need and myscheef / for if any man or woman for myscheef
of hongre or of thryste / or of cold or of any other myscheef / which
myscheef he may not flee to save his life / but he take things against the
lords will. If he take any thing so in peril of death / or in great myscheef
need excuses hy^ fro sin and fro theeft if he do it only for need and not
for couetyse. And he ought to enfourme his conscience and think yt if the
lord of ye thing knew his myschef he should not be myspayed / and than does
he no theeft / for in the last need al thing is common. Also for the lord is
bound to help him at yt need / and also for need has no law Example we have
in ye gospel where we find yt the dyscyples of christ for hongre took eres in
the field and gnydded them and ete the corn for hongre. The pharysees were
asclau^dred thereof and said to christ yt his dyscyples did thing yt was not
leful. And than christ excused them for need of hongre and said that they were
unguilty and Innocents in yt And he put them example of Dauyd that ete for need
of the holy loves in gods tabernacle / which loves only prestes should ete
by the law Math.xij. For it is a general rule in the law / that need has no
law Dives. Is that man ytso takes for need bound to restytuco^n. Pauper Nay.
And yet for more sykernesse and to put him in dread of stelynge his confessor
shall give him somdele penau ce for that doing. Also by way of alms the
wife may take of her lords good in which she has dyspe^saco^n / as in mete
drink and clothes / and give alms mesurable to the nedy / and think that
her husbonde should be pleased with her gift if he saw yt myscheef of ye poor /
and if he sometime forbyde his wife to do alms / she shall not full cesse from
alms dyscretely done. For husbondes make often such Inibyco^ns to their wives
to tempre there gyuyng not fully to let hem. And if she see yt her husbonde be
sclau^dred and wroth with her gyuynge / though his wrath be unreasonable / she
must tempre ye more her gyuynge / but when she may well some what give for them
both with good conscience. Natheles if she see him greatly agreued for her gyuynge
/ and he forbede utterly her to give alms / than it is good yt she obey to
his bidding and be sorry yt she may not give / and be always in will to give if
she durst / and so win her mede by will alone as she did before by will and
deed. Dives. If the wife have good in propre by hyrself. Bona perafernalia. may
she not give thereof with out her husbondes will. Pauper. She may give / and she
is bound to give and he ought not to let her. Dives I suppose that the
husbonde forbede his wife utterly to do alms of his good / and she see a man
or woman in utter myscheef / may she not than give them alms and help
them. Pauper. In yt need she is bound to give and shall give / and think yt
her husbonde saw that need he should not be myspayed. We read in the first
book of kings.xxvi. ca. That there was a great nygard and an angry shrewe whose
name was Naball. He had a good woman wise and fair to his wife whose name was
Abygaell. That time Dauyd fled the persecuco^n of king Saul / and lived in
deserte with.vi. hundred men with him as outlawes. And for myscheef he sent.x.
men to this rich Naball praynge him of some alms in mete and drink. But
this Naball despised Dauyd and his messangeres and called them thieves and
outlawes and flemyd men / and would no good give hem / notwithstanding yt they
had saved his good and his bestes all y^ time that they were in deserte. When
Dauyd herd these tidings he was wroth / and came with.iiij. hundred men to
slay Naball and all that longed to him It happened yt a servant of Naball
told his wife Abygaell how Dauyd had sent messangers to Naball / and how he
had despised them. Anon Abygaell without wyttynge of Naball charged asses
with bread and wine with soden flesh of five sheep / fygges and reysens and
other vytales great plente and sent to Dauyd by her seruau tes / and she
followed after and happened to mete Dauyd in his coming Than Dauyd repreued her
husbonde Naball of his unkindness / and said he should slay him and all that
longd to him. Than yt good woman Abygaell fell down to ground and worshypped
Dauyd and prayed him of audyence. Than she axed mercy for her husbonde Naball
and excused hyrselfe that she wyste not of his messangers when they were there
and prayde Dauyd that he should not so venge himself and taught him much
goodness / and prophesied to him much wealth and prayed him that he would
accept her presaunt / and so he did. Than Dauyd said to her. Blessed be our
lord god yt sent the this day to me / and blessed be thy speech and blessed
be you that this day haste let me fro sheddynge of blood to venge myself.
And than Dauyd turned again in to deserte / and she came home again and found
her husbonde Naball at souper solemply. But that night she spoke naught to him
of that matter for he was full dronken. But in the morrow when he was sobre she
told hy^ what she had do to save his life. And anon his heart dyed for sorrow
/ and he wexe heavy as a stone / and within ten days he dyed a wicked death /
and than Dauyd wedded his wife Abygaell. Also if man or woman stele away
man's sword when he is wood to let him of manslaughter of himself or of
other / he does no theeft ne sin. Also by cause of ryghtwysnes man may take
away other men's goods against there will / as in ryghtful battle / so that
they yt fight right fully against the vnryghtful take there goods not for
couetyse / but for ryghtfulne s;se to show yt they have occupied tho goods
wrongfully. But if they talk there goods for evil couetyse they do rauayne
though the deed be ryghtfull in themself.

Dives. If a thing be lost and he that fyndeth it keeps it still is it
theeft. Pauper. He that fyndeth it is bound to restytuco n if he may wete to
whom it longs. And therefore he shall do men to wit of the finding by open
speech in town street and in church that he yt ought it may challenge it. And
if no man challenge it / he yt found it may by auctoryte of a wise confessor
keep it stylle if he be poor and nedy and pray for him that ought it / or
else give it to other nedy that they may pray for him yt ought it and so
make restytuco^n. Therefore says saint Austen in Omelia. If you haste found any
thing and not made restytuco^n / that thing you have stolen. For he says /
god takes more head to the heart than to the hand. And therefore theeft is done
in a small thing as well as in a great For god charged not the thing yt is
stolen / but the wicked will of the steler / as saint Austen says and saint
Gregory. And therefore if childern in there youth stele pynnes or apples or any
other small things / anon as it is perceived they should be hard chasty s;ed
in the beginning. For the phylo s;ophre says. Principijs obsta. With stand
the beginning of vices and of mycherye. For when childern in young begynnen to
have liking in mycherye / though the thing be small in value their sin is
not the less / ne the sin of them that suffer them Therefore it is gods
dome yt when they be not chastysed in there youth for such mycherye /
afterward they stele gretter things and be hanged to shame and shenshyp of
all there kynne. And therefore as Boecius de disciplina scolariu^ tells. When a
man's sone of Rome should be hanged / he prayed his fader to kiss him / and
he bote of his faders nose saying to him Think well fader on this token and
chastyse better thy childern / for haddeste thou chastysed me in my youth. I
should not have be hanged. Therefore the wise man says. Qui parcit virge odit
filiu^ suu^ etc^. He that spares the yerde hates his sone. And he loves his
sone that chastyseth hy^ and techeth him besely. Prouer.xiij. We read that on a
time a poor man was tempted to ete goos flesh / but he durst not stele for
dread of hanging. On a day he met with the fend and he bad him stele a
goos and ete enough at ones / and he did so. And soon after he stale an ox
and was take and led to the galowes. And than the fend met with him and
said to him wheder away. Than the thief said to the fend / woo worth the
wicked wight for you haste brought me to this end. Than said the fend blame me
not / for thou myghtest see by the byll that it was no goos.

Dives. I suppose that a man have borrowed a thing / and he that lent it him
takes it away fro him preuely against his will and against y^ couenau t of the
lenynge / does that man theft so taking away his own good Pauper. He does
theefth. For it is not for yt time fully his own good / as Raymu^de says
li.ij. ti. de furtis. And if lord or lady / or any other man betake his
servant or his offycer any thing to keep / and he take it away fro him
without his wetynge for false couety s;e or for malice to endau^gere the
servant / he does theft. For though the thing be his own / yet it is not
freely his own as long as the servant by his assent has keeping and
dyspensaco^n thereof. Dives. I suppose a ma^weneth to take his own good when he
takes an other man's good against his will / or if he take his own good
vnlefully wenynge yt it were lefull so to take it / does he any theeft in this
case. Pauper. Nay / for all though in case he do vnlefully / yet in this case
he does no theft ne dedely sin / and yet he is bound to restytuco^n. Theeft
encludeth always gyle and falsenes with out which is no theft. And if a man take
of an other man's good with out his wyttynge / if he have a Just cause to
wene yt he should not be myspayed tho he wyste it than does he no theft ne
sin / and if he take an other man's good wenynge yt it be not his will tho
it be his will yt he take it / yet he does theft and dedly sin in gods sight
/ but he is not bound to restytuco^n when he knows yt it is yt lords will /
ne the lord may not axe restytuco n sith it was his will. If a man or woman by
mys eggynge take away an other man's servant he does theft If a man selle or
bye man or woman yt is fre / or gyuet him or takes him of gift ayenst-hys will
/ he does theft as says Raymu^.vbi su^. If a man or woman be take prisoner in
time of ryghtfull batayl he is not fre. And therefore his master may give him or
selle him by law of arms / but wa^e hy^ of law of conscience and of charity
Dives. If a man have hired or borrowed an horse or any other thing in a certain
place and for a certain time and he pass yt place or his time against his will
that ought yt thing does he theeft. Pauper. If he do so of purpo s;e and for
couetyse or some evil cause he does theft. But if there fall a sudden case
when he comes to that place that he hired it to / and he knew not of that
case when he hired that thing / and he must needs perform that case or
else fall in great harm / than he may take that horse or other thing
ferther and longer without theeft / so that he may truly pay for that that he
passes in the first couenau t. Dives. And what if a man lene away an other
man's good without assent of him / which good he lent him to his use. Pauper.
He does theft / but he have Just cause to wene yt the lord of yt thing shall
not be myspayd. For in yt lenynge he uses an other man's good against his will
for lucre and winning of frendshyp. And if a man lene an other any thing upon
a wed / and he used that wed without leave of him that ought it / he does theeft
/ but it be for saluaco^n of the thing. For if he use it for sparyng of his
own good for lucre or for falls couetyse against his will yt ought it / he does
theft as says y^ same clerk. If a thing stolen perysshe / though y^ thief
have no profit thereby / yet is he bound to restytucyon / and he must yield
as good or better than it was when he took it. And he is bound to make
restytuco n both of yt thing and of y^ profit yt came thereof to hy^ / and for
yt profit that should have come thereof to y^ lord in the time yt he occupied
it against his will. And if he have amended y^ thing yt he stale / he may not
axe it again ne withholde his expenses / and he shall make restytuco^n after y^
the thing was worth when he stale it or better. If y^ thief profre the lord
in couenable time and place y^ stolen thing / and the lord will not receive it
/ if the thing after yt by myshap perysshe / the lord has none accyon against
the thief for y^ lettynge of restytuco^n ne for the profit that might have
come thereof after that he profred it to him / but for the time before. If a man
have stolen a thing he is bound not only by restytuco^n of yt thing / but
also of the value of the use. Dives. If a man or woman bye in open market a
thing stolen / wenynge that it were not stolen / when he knows the sothe /
may he axe the price of yt thing of him that ought it or withdraw it till he
have paid hy^ as much as he paid therefore. Pauper. Reymu^de and other
clerks say nay. And therefore beware an other time / both for loss of his and
also for suspecco^n of theft / for lightly for beggy^g of stolen thing he might
be take as a thief. Nethelesse he may ryghtfully axe his payment of him that
sold it to him when he has restored it to the lord of yt thing / and if he
spent any thing in amendment of yt thing while it was in his keeping / he may
with good faith axe that of him that ought the thing without restorynge of the
profit yt he had of yt thing before he wist that it was stolen. But when he
knows yt it is stolen and other men's / and he keeps it stylle for couetyse
or any other unlawful cause / he is bound to restytuco^n fro yt time as long
as he keeps it of the profit to the lord. If the thing pery s;she while he
keep it not knowing yt it was stolen by good faith / he is bound to
restytuco^n. And if he sold it away or gave it or he know of y^ stelynge he
is not bound to restytuco^n of y^ thing / but of y^ profit if he be amended
thereby / and this is good law of conscience. If a man stele of a rich negard
or an usurer any thing to do alms / he does theeft. Quia no^ su^t facie^da
mala vt venia^t bona.xxxij.q^. iiij. sicut no^ su^t. For as saint Austen says.
All though he give in alms all yt he has taken in stelynge / he is not
excused of theft / for he puts sin to sin. First he steleth / and in yt
gives it away he makes himself unable to make restytuco^n. And though a man
purchase much good falsely and do alms of that mysgoten good / he is not
excused of rauayne.

if the seller be much amended by yt selling / and the byer much apeyred
Dives. It is hard to know what is y^ right value of a thing. Pauper The
right value and the Iulte pryse of a thing is after that the common market
gooth yt time. And so a thing is as much worth as it may be sold by common
market. Tanti valet quanti vendi potest. Hec sm^.con. li.ij.
ti.viij.q^.i.et.q^.ix. If a man or a woman selle a thing for good and he know
a defaute therein / by which defaute the byer is desceyued / he does gyle and
theeft. Also and if the byer begyle so the seller. And therefore god said to the
false Jews. Argentu^ tuu^ versu^ e^ in scoria^. et vinu^ tuu^ mixtu^ est aqua.
Thy silver is turned in to dross of silver and in to false metal / and thy
wine is meddled with water. Ysai^.i. And therefore they yt begyle folk with false
money wyttyngly / do great sin and peryllous theeft. Also if he selle
wyttynly by false mesure / and by false weyghtes. And therefore god says / thou
shall not have diverse weyghtes more and less / to bye by the more / and to
selle by the less. Ne you shall not have a more busshell and a less busshell
ne none other false diverse mesures. But thou shall have Just weight and true
/ and even busshell and true / that you may live long in the land that god
shall give the. God hates that man that does such gyle / and he hates all
manner of vnryghtfulnesse. Deutro.xxv. Also if a man or woman selle a seek
thing for an hole thing wyttyngly to begyle the byer / he does theeft / and
is bound to restytuco^n. And though he know not yt defaute when he sells it
/ when he knows yt defaute / he is bound to make some reco^pensacion / as
says the same clerk in the same book and place.q^.xi. Also if the seller
selle a better thing than he weneth to selle in great damage of himself / as
if he selle gold for laton / or if he selle a good thing for a small pryse
wenynge yt it were little worth / if he be much harmed thereby the byer is
bound to restytuco^n or reco^pen s;aco^n. Dives. Is the seller holden to tell
the byer the defautes of a thing yt he sells. Pauper. If the defau^ be preuy
and peryllous / he is holden to tell them to the byer and selle yt thing
better chepe. For if he selle an halting horse for a swyft horse / and a
ruynous house for a strong house / it is peryllous and harm to the byer / and
he is bound to restytucyon. But if the defaute be open / and though it may not
serve the seller / it may serve the byer / than it needs not the seller to
tell the defautes / but he is bound to selle it for the less price. Dives.
May a man selle a thing a derrer than he bought it. Pauper. Else might no
man live by his marchau^dyse ne by his craft. He must take up his costs and
sustain him and his by mesure and worship god and holy church / and help
the poor nedy after his astate. And for this end it is lefull and nedeful to
the chapman and to the werkman to selle thing derrer than he bought it. And
therefore saint Poule says that noman is holden to travail on his own costs
for the comunyte / neither in knyghthode ne in chapmanhode ne in werkmanshyp.
And they that with false oaths / and lesynges and llye speech begyle folk in
byeng and selling sin grievously / and be holden to restytuco^n if they
begyle so folk wyttyngly. Dives. If two persons betake the third person a
thing to keep by covenant that he shall not deliver it but to them both to
gydre / is he bound to keep covenant. Pauper. Ye torsoth. Dives. And what if
he deliver it to one of them in absence of the other / and without his
wyttynge. Pauper. He does amys / and yet neither of hem has lawful accyon
against him for to compelle him to yield it. For he yt resceyued it again has
none accyon to him / for he took it him again. And yt other has none accyon
against him / for he is not bound to him without the other yt made the
covenant with him and has resceyueth it again. Thus la^t^ Hostiensis in

Dives. May not a man do alms of evil gotten good. Pauper. Solomon says
Immolantis ex iniquo. oblacio est maculata. The offering of him yt offers of
evil gotten good / is spotted and foul in gods sight. And he yt offers
sacrefyce of the poor man's good / is like him that sleeth the sone in the
sight of the fader. And god yt is highest approves not the gifts of the
wicked men / ne takes head to their offering. Ecc^ (...) And therefore Solomon
says. (...) deum de tua substancia. Worship thy lord god with thine own
(...) not of other men's good. Prou^.iij And Tobye said. Ex substancia t^a fac
elemosina^. Of thine own good do alms. Tobie.iiij. Dives. Contra God
byddeth in the gospel that men should make them friends in the bliss of
heaven of rychesses of wyckedne s;se. Facite vobis amicos de ma^mona
iniquitatis. Therefore it seems that it is lefull to do alms of evil gotten
goods. Pauper. In three manners a thing may be evil gotten For sometime it is so
mys gotten that it must be yolden again to him that ought it / as in theeft /
raueyne / and viirye if he may be found. And so of mys gotten good men should
do none alms / but yield it again. Also a thing is mys gotten when both
gyuynge and taking of the thing is against gods law / and both the gyuer
and the taker lose their right / as in symonye And therefore neither they may
do plesau^t alms of that good so mys gotten. Also a thing is mys gotten /
when the deed and the craft that it is gotten by is so unlawful that the taker
may keep it stylle lefully / but the gyuer may not axe it again / as thing
gotten by lecherye and by sinful Iapery of yrregulers / of mynstralles /
wytches / and such other / which manner winning is called foul winning that
is Turpe lucru^ in latin. And of such evil gotten good they may do none
alms. But they should make non open offrynge at the aultre ne sacrefyce of
so mys gotten good. And therefore god says. Non offefres mercede prostibuli in
domo dni^ dei tui. ^a abominacio e^ apnd deu^. Thou shall not offer the mede of
the woman a common lechour in the house of thy lord god. Deutro.xxiij. And
officers of kings princes lords and ladies of bysshoppes and prelates that
take gifts of men by common custom or by proufre y^ they should mayntene them
and give them favor in their causes / they may do alms of goods so gotten /
all though it be full often evil gotten xiiij.q^.v.no^ sane. For to such christ
badde that they should make them friends in heaven of rychesses of wickedness /
that is to say of rychesses so mys gotten. For he that takes it has no right
thereto. Dives. Why praised christ in the gospel the false bailey that so
forgave men their det / in fraud of his lord to have thank of hem and help
at need. For he forgaf one y^ halfdele his death / an other the fyfth part of
his death. Pauper. Christ praised not the false baylye / but christ says that
his lord praised him not for his fraud / but for his slyght that he did in
help of himself / ne christ tells not that parable in the gospel / that
men should take example of his fraud to help themself by fraud of robberye
of other me^nes good / but to teache men to make them friends by deeds of mercy
and of alms / and forgive other men their dettes as they will that god for
give them there dettes and make them friends in heaven with rychesses of this
world. Dives. Why called christ rychesses of this world rychesses of
wickedness. Pauper. For they ben to much fo^ke occasyon of much wickedness
/ and much disease of hate / wrath / envy / of debate of plee and of great
dyscensyon. And it is full hard to get them or to keep them without sin and
great disease. And therefore saint Poule says that they that coueyte to be
rich in this world / fall in the fendes snare. And the wise man says. If
thou be rich in this world / y^ shall not be unguilty ne clean from sin.
Also leave friend ye shall understand that wickedness in holy writ is taken
not only for sin / but also for pain and disease and myscheues of this
world. And so goods of this world ben called rychesses of wickedness /
that is to say of pain and disease and of myscheef. For they bring men in to
pain travail and much disease / for men have much travail in getting /
much dread in keeping / and much sorrow in the lesynge. Dives diuicias no^
ogregat absque labor. Non tenet absque me to nec deserit absque dolor. They
behote sykernesse and bring folk in to great peril / great dread / and in
great enmyte. They behote a man to have his lust and liking and bring him in
endelesse hongre. For as Solomon says. The covetous man has never enough.
Auarus no^ impletur pecunia. But always coueyteth more and more. Also they
byhote a man ease and rest and bring him in much trauaylle / for nyghe all
the travail of this world is to get good. An other cause there is why they
ben called rychesses of wickedness. For the law says.x.q^.i. dilectissimis.
By way of kind al men ben even in lordshyppes and rychesses / but by
wickedness of false couetyse in the people men ben uneven in richesse. For
some have much / some little / some ben rich some ben poor / and god has
given more richesse to one man in dyspensaco^n and governance / than to many
other. And that is to refrain the wickedness of false couety s;e in the
people. And for wyckednes is cause that one man is rycher than an other /
therefore they be called rychesses of wickedness. For ne had be the
wickedness of Adams sin / and of false couetyse of man's heart / else all
men should have been even rich. But now they ben uneven in richesse for sin
and shrewednesse. And therefore goods of this world ben called rychesses of
vneuenesse and of wickedness. Iniquitatis.i. no^ equitatis. And therefore all
the rychesses that one man has passing another it is rychesses of vneuenesse.
For in that he is uneven with his even christian / therefore they ben called
rychesses of vneuenesse. Therefore god byddeth the rich men that been but his
bayllyes and his reues in this world make friends of the poor folk / both by
gyuynge and forgyuynge / as that bayllye did / and be not to hard to their
sugettes / but mercyable and forgive hem their dettes which they ought to god
and to them. For god is so great a lord and so rich that there may no man do
him fraud of his good / ne hyndre ne lose his lordshyppe.

Dives. In the fyfth commandment thou saydest that rich men y^ will not
help the poor folk be mansleers. Here thou say y^ they be thieves / and so
it seems that that they do against both commandments. Pauper. In y^ the
poor man may dye for the rich man with holds his good from him / in y^ the
rich man is a mansleer and does ayenste this commandment. Non occides. you
shall not slay. And in y^ he witheldeth his good from the poor man in his need
he is a thief and does against this commandment. Non furtu^ facies. you shall
do no theeft. For all y^ the rich man has passing his needful living after
the astate of his dyspensaco^n / it is the poor man's. And therefore says
saint Ambrose / y^ it is no less sin to the rich man for to deny y^ poor
man help at need when he may help him of his habondau^ce / than it is to
rob a man of his good. The bread says he yt you withholdest in superfluyte is
the poor folks yt have hongre. And the waste clothing yt you shettest up in
superfluyte is the poor wedowes. And the money yt you hydest in the earth in
waste is the ransom of the prisoners and of myscheuous folk for to delyuere
them out of prison and out of bounds / and help them out of woo. And therefore
says he / wit thou it well / that of as many goods you art thief and
rauenour as thou myghtest give to help of the poor folk if thou give them
not. No man should say any thing his own that is common to al Dives. I
assent well to thy words that rich men should give alms of their
habondau^ce saving the astate of their dyspensaco^n / and that is full hard
to do. For much thing is needful to the rich man more than to the poor
because of his astate of dyspensaco^n. For mo things ben needful to a king
than to an earl / and mo to an earl than to a simple knight / and so it is of
other astates. To kings princes and lords is needful to have treasoure to
wage men of arms in defense of the Realm / and to wage their officers in
governance of the Realm and of there lordshyppe. And therefore an Emperor
said. Qui omnibus pree s;t. omnibus indiget. He that is lord by dyspensacyon
of all thing in this world / has need of all thing. And so the more
lordshyppe in this world / the more need. Pauper. Therefore of such things so
nedeful to man after the astate of his dyspensaco^n / he is not bound to give
the poor but in great need. But of other superfluyte that is not needful to
him in that degree / he is bound to give / for always y^ common profit ought to
be charged more / than the profit of one person. Dives. It seems by thy
words that men of holy church which spend the goods of holy thirche in
wicked use / as in pomp / pride / glotonye / lecherye / and in other vanytees
be thieves / for they witholde poor men's good and spend it in mysuse against
the will of god and of poor folk Pauper. That is soth. For saint Ierom says
/ that all yt clercles have of holy church goods / it is the poor men's /
and for help of the poor folk pry^cypaly holy church is endowed To them
that have the benefyces and the goods of holy church / it longs pryncypally
to give alms and to have cure of the poor people. Therefore saint Bernarde
in Epystola ad Eugeniu says thus. The naked cry / and the hongrye plain them
and say the bysshoppes what does gold in your brydels / it may not put a way
coldene hongre fro the brydell. It is our yt ye so spend in pomp and vanytee
/ ye take it from us cruelly and spend it vaynely. And in an other pystle that
he wrote to a chanon he said thus. If thou serve well gods altar it is
granted to the to live by the altar / not to bye their brydelles syluered or
ouergylt. For what thou kepeste for thy self of the altar passing thyn
honest needful living / it is raueyn it is theeft / it is sacrylege.
Therefore these men of holy church that boode there shone with boocles of silver
and use great silver harneys in their gytdelles and knyues / and men of
relygyon monks and chanones and such other that use great ouches of silver
and gold on their copes to fastene their hodes against the wind / and ride on
high horses with sadels harneysed with gold and silver more pompously than
lords / be strong thieves and do great sacrylege so spending the goods of
holy church in vanyte and pride in lust of the flesh / by which good the
poor folk should live. A lady of a thousand mark by year can pynne her hode
against the wind with a small pynne of laton.xij. for a penny. But a monk that is
bounden to pouerte by his professyon will have anouche / or a broche of gold
and silver in value of a noble or much more. Dives. Be not such men of holy
church so myspendynge the poor men's goods bound to restytuco^n. Pauper.
If they have whereof to make restytucyon / they ben bounden to restytucyon / as
says Dockynge super Deutro.v.ca. Quia non dimit titur peccatum donec
restituatur ablatum. And therefore saint Austen in epistola ad Macedonium says
thus. If an other man's good be not yolden again when it may be yolden / he
that stale it does no verry penance / but he fayneth penance. For if he do
verry penance he must do restytucyon to his power. Dives. And what say
thou of tho clerks that spend holy church goods on their kynnesmen and
wymen / and other rich folk for to be mayntened / and for to have a name and
for to be worshypped in this world. Pauper. If they give their kynnesmen and
their friends to releue them of their need / it is well done and the order of
charity axeth it. But if they give the goods of holy church to make them
rich and great in this world of the poor men's good / it is raueyne theeft
and sacrylege. Also to give rich folk mesurably to mayntene them ryghtfully
in holy church / it is well done. But to give them holy church goods to be
worshypped and to have a name of pomp it is evil done / and it is sacrylege
and theeft so to spend the goods of holy church yt ben the poor me^nes
goods. Dives. What sayste you of them that spend the goods of holy church
in their own needful use / and do not their duyte ne serve not therefore.
Pauper. The same clerk Dockynge in the same place says that they ben thieves.
For the goods of holy church and the benefyces ben given to them that they
should travail and serve holy church in techynge prechynge and sacraments
gyuynge / and in besy governance. And but they do so / they be not worthy to
have benefyces of holy church ne to live by holy church goods And therefore
saint Poule says. Qui non laborat / non manducet. He that trauayleth not /
should not etc. And if yt they take holy church goods and trauayll not
therefore as they ben bounden they ben thieves. For if a labourer took money to
trauayll in the field and he trauayled not therefore / but he yaue it again / he
should be holden a thief. And therefore saint Poule said Qui episcopatum
desiderat. bonum opus desiderat. He that desires a bysshopryche / he desires
a good work. Prima ad Thimoth.iij. For as the gloss says / in that that he
desires a bysshopryche / he desires a work / not a dygnyte. He desires
trauayll / not ease and rest / not to wexe in to pride / but for to come from
pride to more lowenesse / to be servant and mynyster to all his subgettes of
which he has cure / or else they be not worthy to live by the goods of holy
church For the benefyces of holy church be not given them for to goo play
them / but for to trauayl about their cure. Dives. They have their vykers and
their parysshe prestes under them. Pauper. The vyker and the parysshe priest
shall answer for that that they resceyue / and the person for that yt he
resceyueth. And he that more resceyueth more is bound. And the benefyces of
holy church be not given to clerks that they should betake to other men the
cure. But for they should have pryncypal cure them self. For else the lewd
man and woman might have the benefyces of holy church / as the same clerk
says. And he says that persons which absent themself fro their chirches
only for ease or for couetyse / or for lust of their flesh / and so spend
the goods of holy church / they ben thieves. Nathelesse as he says they may
absent them from there chirches for a time by leave of their soueraynes that may
give them leave for some good cause / as for learning or for help of their
chirches. Also they yt resceyue the benefyces of holy church and be unable in
that time when they resceyue them to serve holy church / or to have cure of
that benefyce / they ben thieves. But when they fall in age and in feblenesse
after yt they have truly trauayled / or after that the benefyce is given them
they may lefully live by their benefyces / but if they have suffycyent
patrymonye to be sustained with. Also they that appropre to them goods of holy
church be thieves and do sacrylege as says the same clerk Dockynge in the
same place. For clerks in their bgynnynge say. Dn^s pars hereditatis me. Our
lord god is part of mine heritage For as saint Ierom says ad Nepocianu^. He
must be part of god and have god to his part / and so have him in his living
/ that he have god with him and that god have him. And sythen he says god is
my part / he ought no thing to have but our lord god. And if he have gold
silver possessions and such other rychesses / our lord dysdeyneth to be his
part with these parts. And if I be part of our lord. I take no part ne
worldelynesse among other folks / but live by the tithes and am sustained by
service of the altar that I serve. And so I shall be paid with mete and
drink and clothes / and so follow naked of worldely good him that hanged naked
for me on the rode.xij.q^.i. clericus. And therefore he byddeth there yt every
clerk should take heed to his name what it sygnefyeth / and trauayll to be
such as his name sygnefyeth. Quia cleros greci dr sors latin. For clerk in
greek and in latyne / is lot and part in English. For every clerk should
be the lotte and the part of our lord god / and in that they ben ordained
gods service passing the common people. Therefore they ben called clerks.
Clerici / that is to say / chosen by lotte. For they ben kings and governors
of holy church. And in token thereof they bear the crown on their head by
shauynge away of there here. For the shauynge away of their here sygnefyeth
and betokens doing away of temporal goods and wylfull pouerte / by which
they ben kings in heaven. Ibidem ca. duo. And therefore says the law there.
ca. Res ecclesie. That things of holy church ben not had as propre but as
common and ought to be spente in the use that they be given to. For all that
thou clerk haste more than suffyseth the to thy nedeful living / but thou
give it and spend it in good use thou withholdest vyolently as a thief.
Distinctione.xlvij. Sicut. And if clerks have patrymonye suffycyentely of
their own to live by / if they waste the goods of holy church that been
ordained for poor folk / they do theeft and sacrylege.xvi.q^.i. in fine.

Caplm.xiij.
Dives. What is proprely sacrylege. Pauper. Sacrilegiu^ est sacre rei violacio.
vel eiusde^ vsurpaco^. Vnde sacrilegiu^ quasi sacrilediu^ id est sacru^ ledens.
Sacrylege is defoulynge of holy thing or mys using and mys taking of holy
thing. Dives. In how many manners is sacrylege done. Pauper Sometime sacrylege
is done for the person that is despised and mysboden As when a clerk or a
relygyouse is beten or smyten in despyte. Sometime sacrylege is done because of
the place / as when church or chircheyerde is pollute by blood shedynge / or
any holy place is reued of his fredom Also sacrylege is done because of a
thing that is stolen or mysused / and that in three manners. Or for that holy
thing is taken out of holy place / or a thing not holy out of holy place / or
an holy thing out of no holy place.xvij.q^.iiij. quisquis. Dives. Than it
seems that they that with hold there tithes fro god and holy church do
theeft* Pauper. So says the law.xvi.q^.vij. decimas. For the tithes of holy
church ben the auowes of christian people / raumsome of sins and patrymonye
help and heritage of the poor people and trybutes of the nedy
souls.xvi.q^.i. quia iuxta. et ca. decime. Where the law says that tithes be
debt to god. And all that withholden them falsely / they do sacrylege and
rob the poor folk of their goods. And he that with holds his tithes
wrongefully shall answer at the dome for as many souls as perysshe for hongre
and myscheef in that parysshe where he dwells And he that will not pay his
tithes shall myspede / and his good shall vanysshe / and he shall have
sickness and sudden pouerte. Ibidem ca. Reuerfimini. And if he pay his
tithes truly he shall have health of body / and the more plente of good / and
grace of god / and forgyuenesse of sin and the kingdom of heaven. As says the
law. Ibidem ca. decune. Et Raymundus in summa sua li.i.ti.de decunis. And
therefore the law says there that god axeth not the tithes for gift ne for
need / but for worship that we should knowledge him our lord and gy^er of all
good. He axeth of us the tenthe part for our profit not for his pfyt. It is a
sin to pay late / but much more sin it is never to pay. Ibidem.x.ca.
Dives. Of what thing is a man bound to tithe Pauper. Of corn in heruest / of
wine in wendage / of fruit / of bestyall / of gardeyne / of yerde / of medowe
/ of venery of hyues / of fysshynge / of wyn de mylle / and of
watermylle.xvi.q^.viij. Quicu^que et ca. sequenti. Extra. li.iij. ti.xxx.
pastoralis. And as Raymunde says. Tithes ought to be given of all the fruytes
of the earth. Of apples of trees / of herbs of pastures / of bestes / of wolle
/ of milk / of hey / of fysshyng / of fermes / of mylles / of bathes of
fyllynge places / of mines of silver and of other metal / of quarerys of stone
/ of marchau^dyse / of craft and of other goods / and also of time li.i.ti.
xij. And as Hostiensis says libro.iij. eodem titulo. Of every thing right
fully gotten a man should tithe / and of his service and of his knyghtshyp
Dives. Much thing is well gotten and with little advantage of them that get
it / and often with great loss and therefore me thinks it is unreasonable that
a man should tithe his shaffare and his craft or his service or his trauayll
there his winning is little or naught. Pauper. There ben two manner tithes. Some
come of the earth / as corn wine bestyalle that is brought forth by the land
/ and such tithes ben called prediales in latyne Some tithes come only of the
person / as by marchaundyse / and by werkemanshyppe / and such tithes ben
called personales in latyne. And in such tithes that been personales / and
comen of marchaundyse / or of craft / or of such other trauaylle / a man
shall account his expenses / and look whether he is increased or not / And
tithe his winning and his fre increases. In paynge of tithes prediales that
come of the land / he shall not acounte expenses / but freely pay the tithe
neither worste ne best / but as they come to hand without chose Extra
li.iij.e.ti. pastoralis. et ca. cum homines. Nathelesse if a man for devotion
give the best to god / it is prysable and well done. Dives. Should men tithe
of all thing that neweth. Pauper. Things that been taxed in the law men
should tithe / not al thing that neweth / for much thing neweth that is not
profitable And though it be profitable / yet it is not worshypfull / as hou^des
and cattes. Dives. I suppose a man come by free gift or by succession and by
heritage to great lordshyp and much rychesses / or take freely great gifts is
he bounden to give yetenth part of that heritage or of tho gifts to holy
church. Pauper. Nay / for so all possessions and lordshyppes should fall to
holy church. Extra e. pastoralis in glosa. And if a rich man gave a poor
man.x. pens to bye him with a clothe or pay his dettes / or else to his living
/ he should pay the tithe to the priest and that were against reason. For if
all free gifts should betythed holy church should be to rich and the people
to poor / for so he might axe the tenthe part nyghe of every testament.

Caplm.xiiij.
Dives. To what church shall man pay his tithes Pauper Tithes personales as of
marchaundyse and of craft man shall pay to his parysshe church there he
dwells and takes his sacraments and hereth his service. But tithes
prediales should be paid to the church / to which manner and the land
longs to / but custom be in the contrary / as says su^ma conf. Tithes
prediales should be given anon in the beginning / but tithes personales may
abide till the end of the year for the more auau^tage of the church Dives.
How should the tithes be spente. Pauper. The tithes and the goods of holy
church should be departed in four parts after that the parties have need and
be worthy. One to the bishop if him need. An other to the mynystres of the
church. The.iij. to poor folk. The.iiij. to amendment and making of the
church if it need.xij.q^.iiij. quatuor. Where the gloss concludes and says
yt clerks should be compelled to reparacyon of the church and not the lewd
people.x.q^.i. decernimus. But as says Guydo in Rosario' in that men must
take heed to custom of the contree and what the part is that longs to the
church. Dives. I suppose that the curate of the church waste the goods of
holy church in sin and in lecherye / and be an open thief or an open lechour
or mansleer so yt his myslyuynge is s^lau^derous and notorye / should men pay
their tithes to such wicked lyuers. Pauper. Hostiensis says / yt if the
priest or curate of the church myspende holy church goods / or be a notory
lechoure / the lewd man is not bound to give him his tithes. But he shall give
them to his sovereign next above him which is bound to spend them in profit
of the church or of the poor parysshens. Dives. The law is against him. Extra
li.iij.ti. de decimis ca. tua nos. Where the law says that for wickedness of
the myny s;tres of holy church / men should not withdraw their tithes from
them Pauper. Hostiensis answers thereto and says that as long as their sin
is preuy / men should not withdraw their tithes / and so meneth that law.
But when their sin is open and notorye / than men should not pay to them but
to there sovereign Thus says Hostiensis in su^. sua. li.iij. Rubrica de
decimis. S. et quare in fine. And he alleges many laws for him and many
laws ben for him yt he alleges not. For the great clerk Gracianus in the
decrees yt is cheef book of law canon says yt the clerk notorye lechour
should have no part in the goods of holy church. distinct.lxxxi. Si quis
amodo cu^ alijs caplis sequentibus. And there says the gloss that to whom it
is forboden to do office in holy church / to him is forboden and Interdyte his
benefyce But as the law says there. To all such notorye lechours / priests
/ dekenes / subdekenes / ben forboden the offices of holy church that they
should do no offices in holy church / and the people is forboden to here their
office. Therefore than their benefyce is forbodem them till they amend hem.
Ibide^. Siqui sunt presbitert. Upon which law says Guydo in Rosario. That if
prestes be found such open lechours and malefactors / there subgettes may of
their own auctoryte put them from their office / and not abide sentence ne
dome of their sovereign / all though the bishop were favorable to suffer such
wicked lyuers. For why says he / such be suspended by the pope and by the
law ^iues. This sentence is wonderful and not pleasant to men of holy
church / and yet as me thinks it is reason. For if any man ought me debt
and paid it to mine enemy to strength him in his malice against me / wyttynge
well that he should rob me thereof and not pay it me / he did much against me
and robbed me cruelly of my good. And so as me thinks do they that pay
tithes and duetees that long to god and holy church and to poor folk / and
pay them to such wicked lyuers and open enemies to god / for they ben lost
for ever. Or if he kept them stylle or paid them to his sovereign / as
Hostiensis says / than were they save and holy church and the poor people
might be helped thereby. Pauper. It is lefull so to keep them and not against the
law that they allege against hostiensis and against other clerks and against
the common law / for y^ law acordeth with all other clerks if it be well
understand. For these ben the words of the law. Pretextu nequicie clericorum
nequiunt eas.s. decimas nisi quibus de mandato diuino debent suo arbitrio
errogare. Extra libro.iij. de decimis. ca. tua nobis. That is to say in
English. Lewd men may not under color of wyckednes of clerks give by their
own dome the tithes but to them that they ben debt to by the commandment
of god. For it is not lefull to give away an another man's good without the
will of the lord of the good as ye law says there. These words be not
ayenste Hostiensis / for Hostiensis speaks of clerks open lechours and open
wicked lyuers. This law speaks of clerks whose sin is preuy / and of hem
that been defamed falsely by malice of the people / and he byddeth there that
they should be given them again. Also this law says that it should not be
given but to them that it longs to by the commandment of god. But by the
commandment of god they long not to such wicked lyuers / therefore they
should not be given to them. Also though the lewd man withholde his tithes
and his duetees fro such wicked men in holy church and pay them to his
sorayne / or else keeps them stylle for profit of holy church / in that he
gives them not away but keeps them save to profit of holy. church. And
that law men allege against Hostiensis.s. tua nobis / speaks against the lewd
men that give away tithes of holy church and dyspende them as them lyketh /
and give them away to whom that they will / and this is not lefull without
auctoryte of the bishop. If the bishop or any house of relygyon resceyue so
many tithes in a parysshe by old custom / that the curate of the church may
not live hone s;tely by his benefyce / than a certain porco^n of the tithes
may be given to yt curate for to live by / not withstanding the old custom.
Extra li.iij. de prebendis. ca. extirpande. Where the law says / that he yt
has cure of a parysshe should serve it himself and not by an other / but need
of other cure compelle him therfo.

Caplm.xv.
Dives. Shall holy church axe tithes personales of Jews yt dwell among
christian people. Pauper. Nay / for they be not of holy church / and they take
not sacraments of holy church ne service of the curate. If a man gylously
selle a porcyon of corn or it be tythed / both the byer and the seller ben
bound to tithe it. The seller for his gyle and for he has the value of the
tithe. And he that byeth it is bounden for that corn passes to him with
charge of the tithe. And so holy church may axe the tithe of whether of them
y^ he will. But if he get it of the one of them / he may not axe it of the
other But if the byer thought no gyle in his byenge if he paid the tithe
after that he bought it / the seller is bou^nde to make him resty^uco^n. And if
the byer and the seller wist well that it was not tythed / they must both do
penance as for theeft. And if the byer payethe tithe / the seller is bound to
restytuco n but the byer bought it to such a price yt he may yet well save his
own If the corn be stolen or it be tythed / and y^ lord of ye corn were to
slow in the tythynge and tythed not after the custom of y^ place but delayed
it / holy church may axe of him the tithe of the corn so stolen. But if it be
taken away within y^ time of due tythynge he is not bound to restytuco^n of
the tithes Hec Raymu^dus li.i. de decimis. Dives. Is a man bound by the co^mau
dement of god to pay all his tithes both prediales and personales. Pauper. As
Innocencius the pope the third. Extra e. in aliquibus / and Raymu^de also
say. All y^ tithes must be paid yt ben taxed by gods law Leuitici vltimo.
And all other tithes both prediales and personales after custom of the contre
long approved. For consuetude or custom in law posytyue that is man's law
is exposytour and termynour of the law. Consuctudo approbata est optima legum
interpres. Extra li.i.ti. quarto.cu^ dilectus. Et consuetudo est altera lex.
But there may no consuetude or custom be kept against gods law / ne against
law of kind. Dives. Why bad god yt men should pay more the tenth part than
an other part Pauper For.x. is nombre so parfyght y^ it conteyneth all nombre.
For all nombres after.x. ben made of ten and nombres within ten. And nine is
nombre vnparfyght / and all nombres within.x. ben vnparfyght in regard of.x.
And therefore god bad yt men should give him the tenth part / and to keep
themself nine parts / in token that al our parfecco^n comes of god and to
him it must be arretted by prysynge and than king / and all our Imparfecco^n
comes of our self. And therefore we withholde nine parts to our self / and
give to god the tenth part / so knowlechynge that all our parfecco^n and
goodness comes of him / and all our Imperfeccyon comes of our self. And in
token that he is our lord and lord of all and all that we have comes from
him as all our nombres ben conteyneth in ten / and come of ten.

Caplm.xvi.
Dives. Is symonye any spyce of theeft. Pauper. It is theeft and sacrylege in
yt yt a man treats and occupyeth vnryghtful thing that is not his. Of such
thieves speaks christ in the gospel. Qui no^ intrat pro ostiu^ in ouile. sed
ascendit al^unde. hic fur est et latro. Io.x. He that enters not in the fold
of holy church by the door that is christ / and takes not his benefyce freely
by way of alms for crystus sake but by symonye / he is a thief and a
mycher. And all that so come in to the benefyces of holy church by symonye /
they ben mychers and thieves. Dives What is symonye. Pauper. Symonye is a
studyous couetyse and will to bye or selle thing spirytuell / or thing
annexed or knyt to spirytuel thing. For as the phylosophre says / not only he
yt steleth preuely is a mycher / but also he that will stele preuely is a
mycher and a thief. But here thou shall understand that some things be
forboden for they be symonyent / as byenge and selling of the sacraments of
holy church / in which will allone without deed makes a man gylty in
symonye. Some things ben symonyent only for they ben forboden by holy church.
As if a clerk resygne his church in covenant y^ it shall be given to his
neuewe or to some of his kynne such will without deed makes not a man
symonyent ne gyltye in symonye as anentes holy church / but if it be done only
for profit of the person and not for profit of holy church he is gylty
before god. And if he resygne it freely in covenant and in will that it shall
be given to him that is more able to profit to man's soul than he is
himself / in that resygnynge he does no symonye. Dives Whereof came the name of
symonye. Pauper. Of Simon magus a great wytche. For he profred to saint Peter a
great some of money to have grace of the holy ghost to make men hole of
sekenesses / and to do wondres and to make the holy ghost to light in men and
wymen as saint Peter did. But saint Peter forsook his money and said to him.
Thy money be stylle with the in perdycyon and perysshynge of dampnaco^n / for
thou wenest to get the gift of god with it. Actuu^.iiij. And therefore all that
bye any thing spirytuel or any thing knytte to spyrytuell thing ben called
proprely symonientes. And they that selle it ben called Giezites. Giezite in
latin for Giezi the servant of Helyzee the prophet took mede of the great
lord Naman for that god had made him hole of his lepre by the prophet Helyzee
that was his master. And so he selde falsely the gift of god in as much as
was in him against the will of god and of the prophet Helyzee. And therefore he
was lepre and all his kynne after him.iiij. Regu^.v. Nathelesse commonly both
byer and seller of spirytuel thing ben called symonientes. For Simon magus did
that was in him to bye the grace of the holy ghost / and was in purpose and
will to selle it forth to other for money and for gifts. Dives. In how many
manners is symonye done. Pauper. In three manners as thing spirytuel is boughte
and sold by three manner gifts. For sometime it is bought by gift of hand /
sometime by gift of service / sometime by gift of tongue. Gift of the hand is
called money and other rychesses / gift of service is called their service
given not in due manner ne ryghtfully to have a thing spirytuel / gift of tongue
is favor flateryng and prayer yt men make themself or by other so to have
spirytuell things. Also in resceyuynge of holy order is do symonye sometime
only on his side yt makes ordres. As when some friend of him yt shall be
ordered gives y^ bishop some gift without the wetynge of him yt shall be ordered.
Sometime it is done only on his side yt shall be ordered / as if he give any
gifts to any of y^ bysshopes officers to speak for him yt he may be ordered /

yet in neither part / as if a friend of him yt shall be ordered give or behote
any thing to y^ bysshoppes officers to help him iu that cause / and neither
he ne the bishop knowtth of tho gifts. And in these manners may also be done
symonye in gyuynge of benefyces of holy church. If any man give any gift for
me or pray for me that I may be ordered or resceyue benefyce / if I say against
and assent not thereto his gift / ne his byheste / ne his prayer lets not
fro mine ordres ne fro mine benefyce / but if I assente thereto before or after
payenge the money yt he behyght I fall in symonye / and though it be never so
preuy I must resygne. And if mine enemy give or behote gift for my promoco^n

me not. Extra li.iiij. de symonia ca. sicut tuis litteris. If any friend give

Dives. May no thing be given lefully for spirytuel thing Pauper. Yes / for
both gift of hand of tongue and of service / may be given for spyrytuell
thing. Gift of hand may be given for spyrytuell thing in five cases as says
Raymu^. First if it be given freely for deuoco^n and for reverence of y^
sacrament and of spirytuel thing without any covenant or any axynge of y^
taker But for to give any thing by way of couenau t or byeng or sellyng / or
of chau^gyng it is not leful. And if it be doubt whether y^ gift be given by
covenant or by evil entenco^n / men must take heed to y^ astaste of y^ gyuer
and of y^ taker whether the rich give y^ poor or the poor to ye rich / or
rich to rich. Also to the quantyte of ye theeft / whether it be of great
price or of little price Also to the time of y^ gyuyng / whether in time of need
or in other time And so by these circu^stau^ces deem in what manner it was
given. The second case is / when men give freely to any man of holy church any
thing for spirytual deeds as for certain saying and singing to which he is
not bound The.iij. case is when it is given to clerks for spirytuel deeds to
y^ which they ben bound of office. For there is no man bound to trauayl for
naught ne y^ curate serve ye church for naught ne the prechour to trauayl for
naught And therefore saint Poule says that they that serve the altar shall
live by the altar. And so god has ordained yt they yt preche the gospel shall
live by the gospel. Prima ad little.ix. Natheles the more freely yt a man
precheth ye more is his mede. And though he axe not the people is bound to
give him freely as saint Austen says super illud Producens fenu^ iumentis.
The.iiij. case is to have life without end and forgyuenes of sin. Therefore
Danyell said to the king Nabugodonosor. Pcca^ tua elemosinis redime. Dan^.iiij.
Bye again thy sins with alms / not that we may bye heaven / ne forgyuenesse
of sin but by alms doing we may deserve to have forgyuenesse of sin and
heuens bliss / and so byenge is taken for deseruynge. The.v. case is when a
man for to have peace byeth away y^ wrong that he suffers in spirytuell right
when he is syker yt his cause is ryghtfull Extra de symonia ca. Dilecto filio.

Dives. What pain is ordained against symonye proauper If a clerk be a
symonye^t in taky^g of his order / he is suspended of his order both anentes
himself and anentes other so yt he may not do excecuco^n of his order. And
whether his symonye be preuy or aperte he is suspended. And if he be conuycte
before his Judge shall be deposed and unabled to every worship and lose the
money yt he paid therefore. And he yt ordered hy^ wyttyngly by symonye / or gaf
him benefyce by symonye / or he yt resceyueth any benefyce by symonye / or is
mean thereto / though their sin be preuy yet they be suspended / as anent them
self. And if it be open / they ben suspended both anentes themself and anentes
other. And he yt takes his benefyce with symonye / he must resygne and make
restytucyon of all the profit yt he has take thereof / and for the profyt yt
might have be taken thereof for his time For it is a general rule in ye law yt
who so occupyeth any thing with out ryghtfull title / he is bounden to
restytuco^n of all ye harms and of al profit yt came thereof / or might have
come thereof for yt time saving his expen s;es yt he spent in profyt and
saluaco^n of yt thing. And both clerk and lewed man yt does symonye / he is
acursed in ye deed / and if it may be preued yt lewd man should be acursed
openly in holy church. Prima.q^.i. reperiunt. Dives. If the offycer of ye
bishop axe of custom any gift in making of ordres in sacrynge of bysshopes /
in blessing of abbottes / if they yt should be ordered or blyssed or sacred
give them such gifts for custom yt they allege / is it symonye. Pauper. If
he give it pryncypaly for such custom and for their axynge it is symonye /
but if he give it freely / not for there axynge ne for custom ne by covenant /
it is no symonye But most syker it is yt he give none than ne for than / for
it is like symonye. And saint Poule byddeth yt men should absteyne them from
every wicked likeness. Also they yt give or take any thing by way of custom
or of covenant for blessing of weddynges / for sepultures / for diriges for
cream or oil / or for any sacrament in which is given grace he does symonye.
If any curate or parysshe priest for gifts / for prayer / for love / for
frendshyp hyde an open sin of his parysshen obstynat in sin or recou^seyll
hy^ yt will not amend hy^ / or for hate and enmyte will not recounseyll him
that will amend him / or for hate or love or gift or prayer puts any man or
woman from ye sacraments of holy church / he does symonye. If a priest be
bounden of office to say a mass or dirige / and such other prayers and he axe
money therefore / he does symonye / but if he be not bound thereto of office /
and he has not his nedeful living he may take money for his travail and
let his travail to hyre by days and years / as annuelers done / as Raymunde
says. Et extra ne prelati. vices suas. et ca. vltimo. But if he have
suffycyent living and he be not bound to say that mass or dirige / than he
shall say it freely / or else not say it. For else it seems that he does
it pryncypally for couetyse. If a priest have said a mass if he say an other
mass that day for money or for to have thank of the world / he does
symonye. De con. di.i.sufficit.

assent the auaunsynge of thy neuewe Or else one says that as long as I live
shall there no grace of any auau^sement pass while I may let it / but I have
this grace for him y^ I pray for / do these symonye. Pauper. It is symonye.
For the law says. Abut dnis peractio. cesset omnis conuencio.i. q^.ij.qiii
pro. In spyrytuell things every couenaut should be away / every conuencyon
cesse. If the curate will not burye the deed body / ne suffer it to be buried
/ but in covenant that he shall have his bed or his best clothe / or some
other thing he does symonye / all though it be custom to pay that he axeth.
And therefore he should freely burye the deed and bless them that been nedy / and
so absteyne him fro every spyce of symonye / and afterward compelle them to
pay and keep good customs / if yt they might well do it for pouerte. Extra e.
ad apostolicam. If a priest will not baptyse but he have money therefore / he
does symonye. And rather the lewed man or woman should baptyse the child than
give money therefore. And if he were of age that should be baptized / and there
were no man ne woman but the priest / though he were in pe^yll of death / he
should rather dye without baptyme of water than he should be baptized by
symonye. For in that case the baptym of the holy ghost suffyseth to him. Every
man and woman may baptyse for need. If any patron give a benefyce in covenant
/ that he that resceyueth it shall help him temporally and his also / it is
symonye. Extra e. nemo. And if he give it to some of his kynne so to magnefye
him self / and to be the more mighty worldely by auau^synge of his kynrede /
it is symonye. And if a patron selle a patronage by the self / or selle the
manner yt is annexed thereto the more derer for the patronage / he does symonye.
As says Petrus tarentmus super quartu^ sente^. distinct. xxv. And therefore he
says that choppynge of chirches without auctoryte of ye bishop is symony. And
he says there also that right of patronage may not be sold / but it passes
forth with byenge of the land that it longs to. If prechours or pardonysters
or other folk that goo for alms / pray the parysshe priest or the curate
to procure them some good in their parysshe in covenant yt the priest or ye
curate shall have a certain part there of / it is symonye as anentes the priest
for both do symonye / and also they do sacrylege and theeft / in that yt they
defraude men of their good and put it not in the alms that they give it to /
and both the priest and the pardonyster be bound to restytucyon.

IF a man or woman give money to be resceyued in to house of relygyon / and so
in relygyon in covenant that he or she shall give a certain money to y^ house
it is symonye though it be common custom so to give. Nathelesse if he be

charge. If a man or a woman give money to prestes rich or poor / for
trentall / for annuell / for yeredaye / or for to say mass of the holy ghost
or other masses / or to give money to clerks for saying of psalters or of
dyryges / or to poor men in covenant of certain prayers / with entencyon so
to bye their prayers he does symonye. scom glosam Willi.et vt habet in su^.
con.li.i.ti.i.q^.xlij. And yet as he says there / it is lefull to take and to
give money and other temporal things / for such spyrytuell thing and for
prayer by way of deuoco^n and of free gift / so to excyte devotion and love of
persons the more to pray for them. And in this manner men may give to colleges
certain money to keep there yereday not by way of covenant of byenge and of
selling / but so to styre them freely to grant them their axyuge by way of
more charity and more devotion / for such spyrytuell thing may not be sold.
And therefore men should give their good freely to men of holy church by way of
alms / and they should take it freely by way of alms And the gyuer with his
gift of charity may axe certain prayers of them that he gives to / and if
they granted him they ben bounden to keep their grant. Therefore says saint
Austen that the apostles took freely their living of them that they preched
freely to. And as great sin it is the priest to selle his prayer / as the
prechour to selle his prechynge. Christ badde in y^ gospel yt men should make
them friends of the rychesses of this world that they might resceyue them in
to endelesse tabernacles / yt is to say / that they might so pray for hem yt
they might be resceyued in to bliss. And thus must all men of holy church
take their living if they will be ciene out of symonye. For they may not selle
there office yt they do in holy church / ne their prayer / but by fre gifts
take their suffycyent lyuelode. Extra ne prelati vices suas.ca.qm^ enormis.
Dives. Contra. It is ordained by constytucyon synodalle what money a parysshe
priest and what an annuler should take. Pauper. That is not for his office /
but it is done to let the false couetyse of men of holy church / to put in
certain how much is suffycyent to their living yt they should no more axe /
ne men no more give them. But if it be not suffycyent they may take more by
leave of their prelates. And y^ taxynge is not ordained by the gyuer of the
money but by the prelates of holy church / both anentes symonye and against
false couetyse of their clerks.

Caplm.xxi.
Dives. It seems by thy words / that they yt sing the golden trentall go
full nygh symonye. For they make wonderful couenau t of there singing. Pauper
Leave friend you shall understand that covenant making makes often symonye that
should else make no symonye. As if the gyuer axe what it is worth to sing
many masses / and the priest answers twenty shellynges or ten shellynges or a
noble. Or if the gyuer say / sir what wylt y^ take to sing it / and the
priest answer and say / no less than twenty shellynges / or ten shellynges /
and thus bargeyne and broke about the singing of the mass / yt may not be
sold ne bought / as men do in byenge and selling of an horse / than they
fall both in cursed symonye. Also if the gyuer say to the priest in his
bargeynynge / that he shall sing for certain souls and for no mo / and he
behoteth him so / than ben they both accursed for that foul symonye. And also
for it is against charity / for the priest is bounden to sing for all christian.
And for the moo he prays in special by way of charity / the more he
pleases god / and the more ben the souls helped for which he takes his
sellarye. And in that he byndeth him to say special masses in certain time.
He must in case leave the mass of the day y^ he is bounden to if he be a
curate and so does symonye / as Raymu^de says and other clerks. Also he does
in that against the ordenau^ce of holy church. Extra li.iij.de
celebra.miss.ca.ij. Where it is boden that there should no man leave mass of
the day for other special masses. As of the trynyte / our lady / or other /
not for it is evil to here or to say such special masses / but for it is
evil to leave masses of the day for such special masses / as the gloss
says. Nevertheless if a man will here such special masses in reverence of
the trynyte or of our lady / it is well done so that he leave not mass of the
day for such masses Dives Than me thinks y^ curates that been bounden to
say mass of the day to the parysshe / or in case mass of Requiem / may not
well sing such golden trentalles. Pauper. That is soth / ne no priest that
has suffycyent living by other salarye. And therefore it is forboden the
synodales of england / that any person or vyker should make covenant with
his parysshe priest / that he should besides his salarye take annuell or
trentalle / or any such other / that they call vantages Inhibimus
districtius. But they shall give to there parysshe priest suffycyent salarye
whereby they may live without such false couetyse. And in the constytuco^n of
Lambeth the second chaptre / it is boden that no priest shall bind him to
such specy all masses / by the which they might be let yt they might not
serve the church of lawful service of the day as they be bound. Dives.
Sythen than it is so that mass of the day is as good as such special
masses / and that it is as good or better to here and say mass of the day as
such special masses / me thy^keth that by such manner singing of golden
trentales souls ben much desceyued. Pauper. That is so^h. For tho.xxx masses
as they axe / as they say must be in doing all a year nerehande / there they
might have.xxx. masses as helply to the soul out of pain with in.xxx. days.
For in such singing is done much symonye / much ypocresye / and much
folly. For some priests faytours tell the people that but the masses be said
in three days pryncypally of tho feestes / that is to say / in the festes and
in two days next following / else the souls be not helped by tho masses. And
so if y^ priest fell seek tho three days so that he might not sing / all
though he had song all the other masses / that trentale might not be done that
year by their opinion. And so in case he should happen to be in singing of
one trentale.x. year or.xx. year there as he might every year sing his annuel.
Also if our ladies day in lent fall on goodfry day he may than not sing
tho three masses. Also some prestes behyght to fast bread and water / and to
were the here every day when they shall sing any of tho masses for tho souls.
And so they must fast bread and water and were the here on Crystmasdaye.
Eester day / and nyghe all the high feestes of the year. Also they say that
they must have a specyal Oryson that is not of the myssale / ne approved of
holy church / but often repreued / or else as they say y^ masses be lytyl or
naught to profit of the souls. And thus by faytrye and ypocresye many fool
prestes behyght more and bind them to more for.x. shellynges / than a good
priest would do for.x. mark. Dives. And they say that saint Gregorye ordained
that manner of singing to have his mother out of purgatory. And therefore they
call it saint Gregoryes trentale. Pauper They lie on saint Gregorye. For his
mother was a full holy woman as we find in his life And we find not that saint
Gregorye did any priest sing in that manner for any soul. But we find li.iiij
dyalogorum. That when saint Gregorye knew by reuelacyon that one of his monks
was in hard pain of purgatory / for he had be a propryetarye unto y^ time of
his deynge. saint Gregorye badde one of his monks which he let a good man
sing for him.xxx. masses day by day. And in the.xxx. day the deed monk
appeared to the same monk and thanked hy^ for unto this time said he I have be
in hard pain / but now I am delivered And saint Gregorye tells also
li.iiij. dyalogorum. That a soul appeared to a priest and prayed him that he
would have mind of him in his mass. And he song for him.vij. days by and by
and so the soul was delivered. For better it is to deliver a soul out of
pain within.vij. days or.xxx than so to let him longer in pain all the year
when he might be helped within.xxx. days. And so would every man and woman
that is in bodily disease and in prison. And he were no good friend that let
his friend live in prison all a year when he might have him out within.vij.
days or with in.xxx. days.

Caplm.xxij.
Dives. And so it may be that the fend found up the golden trentall so to
long souls in their pain there as they should the sooner be delivered.
Pauper Therefore saint Gregorye.iij.et.iiij. dyalogorum / shows by many an
example that it is best to sing for the souls day by day if the priest be
well dysposed to sing so. And he shows there that lettynge of any day
singing is great disease to the souls / for they desire full much to be
delivered out of their pain. But the people by faytre of covetous clerks is so
blent / that they have lever to give xx. shellynges to forlonge the souls in
pain all a year / than to give.xx. shellynges or.x. to have them out with in a
month or much less time But leave friend better it were to give.xx.
shellynges to help them in haste with the worship of god and of holy church
than to give.xx. shellynges late to help them and that with offense of god and
preiudyce of holy church. And better it is to have four score masses song to
gydre day by day for.xx. shellynges / than to have.xxx masses song in the
long year for.xx. shellynges For why / ye may for.xx. shellynges do sing a
quarter of an annuell and do the souls have part not only of.xxx masses /
but of as many masses as be pens in.xx. shellynges. For though ye give a
thousand pound for a mass / the priest may not appropre y^ mass to any
soul / but only pray for him after that he is bounden / and he must put his
prayer in the will of god and in his plesau^ce / for in case the soul that he
prays for is dampened. And perauenture a poor man that no priest thinks on
in special / that dyed in more charity than he that the priest prays fore in
special / shall rather be helped by the mass of the priest / than he for whom
he prays in specyal Moreover leave friend understand that prayer is a great
gracyous gift of god. For as the clerks say / holy prayer is a styenge up of
manes and womannes heart to god. Oracio est ascensus mentis in deum. And that
may no man have without special gift of god. For christ says in the gospel
/ that there comes no man to him / but the fader of heaven draw him by Inward
goostely mocyon yt is Inward devotion. And without this Inward devotion the
prayer of mouth is right naught worth. And therefore it is good some time to
give alms to a good priest which has need of alms to meue him to pray
for you that ye may have the grace of god and swetnesse in him by y^ prayer of
the priest and your alms. Natheles ye shall not give him alms to
constrayne him to certain prayer after your deuyse so to let him of his deuoco
n. Ne ye shall not give him alms with Intenco^n to let him to pray for whom
yt he will after yt his devotion is and after yt god gives hy^ grace. For
always the priest must be more free to pray than ye may be to give / ne ye
may not with your gift constrayne him ne let him to pray for whom yt he will
pray. For all though the priest be arted by the law of his taking / there may
though no law art him of his prayer but that he shall always be free to
pray for whom yt he will / and as his devotion is for all christian / and for
the co^^ersyon of all hethen folk. And therefore leave friend ye shall give
freely to the preeste what you ^yketh so to e^cyte his devotion to p^aye for
you and the more to have you in love and mind in his preyers / not to lose his
charity to pray for other. For the mo that he prays fore by way of charity
/ the more profit it is to you and to your friends souls that he syngeth fore.

Dives. Thy speech seems tone full reasonable / but I pray the if relygyouse or
seculer clerks selle any gr^u^de of santuarye in church or chircheyerde to

the ground of sant^arye may be sold to buryenge without symonye iij. q^.ij.et
ca. postquod. et in su^ma conf.li.i. ti.xvi.q^.i. Much more than it is symonye
to selle the ground of santuarye in church or in chircheyerde to chapmen to
set on their bothes and their stalles for to make gods house an house of
marchau^dyse and a den of thieves against the lore of christ. And if the
colleges or curates selle the ryngynge of their belles at buryynges or at
dyryges / so that they will not suffer their belles be rongen but they have a
certain money therefore it is symonye / and to selle the office of ryngynge is
symonye. Nathelesse the ryngers may take for their travail. And he y^ has the
office of ryngynge freely given to him may let y^ office to hyre without symonye
/ in su^ma conf li.i.^i.i. Dives. It seems by thy speech y^ clerks charged
sometime much y^ vice of symony. Pauper It must be charged / for it is a sin
that god p^nyssheth full hard For as Ierom Austen and Gregory say symonye of
the prestes of the old law was one of the pryncypall causes why god destroyed
the cite and the temple of Jerusalem and the kingdom of Jews. Dives. Is it
symonye if c^lleges of relygyous or of seculers abbot or pryour selle out their
house lyuerau^ce. Pauper. Many clerks say that it is no symonye / but it is a
full vnsyker marchau^dyse. And I dare say yt it is sacrylege and theeft full
nyghe symonye. For why the goods of holy church so well endowed ben given to
help of the poor and to keep hospytalyte not to selle them again to rich men
to maynten then in unlust and in bodily ease / but that the clerks that serve
y^ church shall live thereby. and to spend the remenau^t in hospytalyte and in
alms to the poor people. And so the goods of that colleges ben not here
but as dyspensours / for they ben the poor men's to whom and for whom tho
were given. And by such lyueraunce the colleges be brought to pouerte / and
the poor and the seek that should be helped thereby ben defrauded and robbed of
their right. And persons ben made rich and the comonte over poor / and
charity is exyled out of the congregacyon. For when the money is paid / the
relygyouse that sold the lyuerau^^e desires the death of the byer. And commonly
such lyuerau^ces ben sold in hope that the byer shall soon dye / or in hope
that in his ending he shall give to them all his good or much thereof
passing his covenant. And so selling of such lyuerau^ces is far from
charity / and deep grounded in false couetyse / and it is theeft and sacrylege
in that y^ they so mynystre the goods of the poor folk and selle them
away / by which goods the poor folk should be helped / and so both the
byer and the seller do sacrylege For these causes and many moo selling and
byenge of such lyuerau^ces ben utterly forboden by the laws of holy church
in constitucionibus octo bon^ ca. volentes.

Dives. Is vsurye and gonell any spyce of theeft. proaupro In case it is full
great theeft Dives. What is proprely vsurye. Pauper. Vsurye is a winning axed
by covenant of lenynge and for lenynge / as Raymu^de says li.ij.^.ti. And it
is done most commonly in things of nombre / of weight / and of mesure / as in
money y^ is told / or metal or other thing y^ is weyed / or in corn oil /
wine that is mesured. Dives. How many spyces ben there of vsurye Pauper.
Raymu^de says yt there ben two spyces of vsurye / one is spyrytuell and
ryghtfull of which Christ speaks in the gospel. Luce.xix. Quare no^ dedisti
pecunia^ mea^ ad mensa^ and^. Why gave y^ not my money to y^ board / y^ is to
say / my grace and my gifts to profit of other men by open co^munycaco n.
And so spyrytuel vsurye is called multiplycaco^n of the gifts of god / and of
the graces yt god has given to man or woman / not to hyde them but to comyne
them forth to profit of other. And so with the grace and the gift y^ god has
given to man for a little travail to win an hundred fold mede in heaven. An
other vsurye is bodily usure and unrightful that comes of false couetyse by
covenant of lenynge. For if winning come freely to the lener for his lenynge
without covenant / so that his entencyon were not corrupt in his lenynge /
but that he lent pryncypally for charity and not pryncypaly for worldely
winning it is none vsurye all though he hope to have and so have auantage by
his lenynge. But if he lent it pryncypaly in hope of worldly winning whether
he lent it with covenant or without covenant of winning for his false covetous
entencyon he does vsurye and is an usurer. Therefore christ says in the
gospel. Date mutuu^ nichil inde sperantes. Luce.vi. Give ye your lone hoping
no winning thereof / that is to say / as says the gloss. Do ye it pryncypaly
for god and not for man / but hope ye pryncypally to have your mede of god
ytbyddeth you leave. And than whether the borower pay or not pay god shall
yield you your mede. Dives. May the lener axe no thing of ye borower for his
lenynge Pauper. No money ne thing yt may be mesured by money neither mete
ne drink ne clothe / ne gift of hand of tongue ne of service But other thing
yt may not be mesured by money he may axe / as love and charity / good will
and good frendshyp for his lenynge. Dives. Why is vsurye holden so great a
sin. Pauper. For the usurer sells togydre the thing yt he leneth and the
use of the thing. And therefore usure comes of ye selling of ye use. The
usurer sells the thing yt he leneth in yt that he takes more over for the
use of the thing. Wherefore thou shall understand that many things there be
that may not be used without waste and destruccyon of the thing / as mete and
drink and such other / and in such the use may not be departed from the
thing. But needs he that grants the thing grants the use of the thing
/ and they may not be sold a sondre. And in such things if the seller take
for the use he sells that thing twyes / and sells thing that naught is.
For the use of that thing is full waste thereof / and for such selling of the
use it is called vsurye For the usurer sells the thing in it self and the
use over. Some things there be in which the use is not full destruccyon of
the thing / as use of an house is the dwelling or occupaco^n thereof / and in
such the lordshyp of the thing may be granted without ye use and ye use
without the lordshyp And so a man may take his house yt he leteth to hyre again
to him and over take for the use of the house. But as the phylosophre
says.viij. Politicorum. ye use of money is chau^gynge of one for an other to
help and ease of the comonte which chau^gynge is destrucco^n of the money
and wasting in manner In that he that chau^geth it for other thing so spent it
away. And therefore it is unlawful for to take any thing for the use that
ought to be common to all as it is ordained to help and ease of all. And
therefore it suffyseth that the lener take again the even value / and if he take
more over for the use he does usure and he is bound to restytuco n. Dives.
Contra. God gaaf leave to the Jews to take usure of other naco^ns. Pauper. That
was to flee the more evil / for else they would have taken vsurye of their
brethern for couetyse / and that god forbadde them and granted to them to take
usure of other nacyons about them and among them both to spare their own

IF lords of mylles lene money to bakers or to other folk in covenant that
they shall not grynde but at their mylles they do vsurye and so let them yt
they may not grynde freely where they will / and if they be harmed thereby / the
leners be bounden to make restytuco^n. But if they be not harmed thereby they be
not bound to restytuco^n but for that they let them of their fredom somdele
they be bounden. And the same is of chapmen that selle to creaunce to let the
byer from other chapmen / or because of her lenynge selle to them more derer
than to other. Such sellers ben bounden to restytucyon in that the byer be
harmed and hyndred. If the lener or any other man will not give to his dettour
longer time of payment when he may not keep his day assygned but he have some
gift though he axe no gift openly he does usure. And if a chapmen selle the
more derer for the lenynge of his price than he should selle if he paid anon
/ he does usure and he is bounden to restytucyon. Extra li.e.ti. consuluit. If
the borower upon usure fail of his day of payment / he y^ is his borowe may
pay that money with y^ usure to the lener / and do his dettour for whom he
is borowe pay to him again that money with the usure. For it is to the borowe
none usure / for he wynneth naught thereby / but so flees myscheue that should
else fall to him. If a man be compelled to borowe money with usure for
falsehede of his dettour that will not pay him at his term / that false
dettour is bounden to make restytucyon / not only of his det but also of the
usure that he was compelled to pay for his falsehede / or else deliver him out

y^ whete shall be more worth or less in time of payment it is none usure. But
if it were semely that it should be more worth in time of payment and he lent
the money in hope of y^ lucre he did usure. Extra e. ti. nauiganti.et in su^ma

that he abides of his pay he does usure. And if the byer bye a thing for
less than it is worth for that he pays before or the thing bought may be
taken to him / he does usure. ibidem in su^ma conf. If a man lene silver or
wine to have again the same quantyte in certain time only in hope yt the same
quantyte shall be more worth in time of payment he does usure / and if the
dettour will pay him his det before that time to flee his own harm / and he
will not take it of him to the time assygned of the payment so to win by his
lenynge he does vsurye. If a man lene money to resceyue a certain time corn
wine or other thing ^herfore he shall take as much as comes thereto in time
of payment and no more. If a man lene money to resceyue other manner money
therefore in certain time to win thereby and so charge his dettour he does
vsurye. If a man selle a thing for certain price as the market goth in time of
y^ selling in covenant y^ if it be better worth before cester that he shall
pay so much more / and though it be less worth he shall pay no less / he
does vsurye. If the byer bye horse or other bestis for less price than they be
worth in time of byenge to resceyue them after in certain time of feyre it is
usure / but he wene sykerly that it should be than only so much worth or less
worth / but if he wene that they should be that time more worth it is vsurye.

IF a man let his horse / his ox or cow to hyre in covenant that y^ the
best dye or appeyre / he that hyreth it shall stand to that loss and to
half winning if it amend he does vsurye. For it is not semely that he should
have as much profit by the amendment of the best as he should have harm by
the death. Nathelesse though he that lets it to hyre make such covenant
with him y^ hyreth it to do him be the more besy to save the best he does no
sin / if his purpose be not to take though the best perysshe without his
defaute. But if he do it for gyle or couetyse / he does vsurye. And therefore it
is good to flee such couenauntes. For all though his entencyon be good / yet
the manner of the covenant seems wicked and sclaunderous to folk that know
not his entencyon. Nathelesse he that hyreth a thing may lefully take to him
the peril and the myscheef of that thing y^ he hyreth if he will If a man
betake his be to a poor man to hyre or to keep in covenant utterly y^ if
it dye it shall dye to the poor man and live to him for he will have as good
therefore it is wicked vsurye Such usurers ben the fendes charmours / for to
such folk their sheep / ne their bestes shall never dye. If men in time of
plente bye in corn or other needful things / pryncypally to selle them
forth more derer in time of derthe and of need / it is sin. But if it be do
pryncypaly for common profit and for salvation of the contree it is medefull.
For Joseph governor of Egypt did so to save the people in time of hongre.
Gen^. xlvij. Also a man may do so for his own psofyt to flee myscheef coming
by way of prouydence / and though he selle forth in time of need to help of
other as the market goth he does no sin in yt / but if he witholde it and will
not selle forth in time of need thing y^ he has passing his living / but
keeps stylle in hope of more derth / he synneth grievously. And therefore
Solomon says. Qui abscondit frumentu maledicet in populis. Bn^dictio dni^

shall be accursed among the people. And y^ blessing of god upon the head of

marchau^dyse. But if they do it only of auaryce and to compelle men to bye men
at there liking and as dear as they will / than they sin grievously / and
namely couetou s;e clerks that have enough else whereby to live. For to clerks
it is not granted such marchaundyse. If a clerk bye a be or an other
thing / and by his husbondrye or by craft lefull to him it be amended or put
in better degree than it was before he may selle it forth lefully for more
than he bought it to. For such doing is called proprely craft and not

lene old corn to have therefore new corn at the heruest / and will not take
old corn for old corn / as good for as good when the borower may pay it /
he does vsurye as Raymunde says Et su^ma confess. vbi supra. But if it be done
pryncypally to save his own good that else should perysshe / or pryncypaly for
help of his neighbor he does none vsurye. By gods law all vsurye is
dampened. By emperors law and by man's law some time it is suffers not for
that it is good ne lefull but for to flee y^ more evil / for often men should
perysshe but they might borowe upon vsurye. For else the covetous rich men
will not lene to the needful / and so the law of man ryghtfully suffers it
for a good end. But the couetouse man does it vnryghtfully and for a wicked
end. And therefore holy church dampneth them y^ lene upon vsurye but not in
them that borowe for need / or for a good cause upon vsurye when he may not else
borowe. But if they borowe for a wicked cause / as for play at y^ dyce / or to
spend it in glotonye lecherye or pride / or in other wicked use / they sin
grievously. And though it be lefull to borowe for a good end upon vsurye / yet
it is not leful to lene upon vsurye / ne to counseyll any to borowe upon
vsurye. As it is lefull to a christian man to take an hethen man that swereth by
his false god. And yet it is not lefull to the christian man for to axe of him y^
oath ne to styre him thereto. For why oath and swerynge is a dyuyne worship that
longs only to verry god. Also notaryes that make Instruments upon
couenau^tes of vsurye ben forsworn. For when they be made notaryes / they make
an oath that they shall never make Instruments upon couenanutes of vsurye. And
so if they make any such Instruments they ben forsworn / and they may never
after bear witness in any cause / ne make Instruments in any cause. For they
ben made thereby of wicked name / and unable to every of fyce worshypfull in the

But such reasons and many other that been not written here / the false usurers

money ne corn ne any other thing / but lene it to him without vsurye that thy
lord god may bless the in every work that you haste done. Deuteronomy.xxiij. For who
so leneth to his even christian without vsurye he shall speed the better And they
that lene with vsurye / shall speed the worse. And in what land vsurye is used

travail and unright and much wrong is in y^ cite and gyle and usure fails
not from the stre^es of that cite. Die ac (...) circu^dabit ea^ super muros

selling the prophet Zacharye says y^ he saw a book fleing in the air yt

might be / and y^ angel said to him / it is the curse of god y^ gooth to the

law of grace / for charity y^ is pryncypall byhest of the law of grace
byddeth y^ men should give to other of their good and not take from the^
w^ongfully. We find in holy wryt. Iosue.vi.et.vij.ca. That Achor stale gold
silver and cloth against the byhest of god / he and his wife his childern and
all his bestes were stoned to the death first / and afterward burnt with all
his other good yt he had and.xxxvi. men slain with enemies for y^ theft of
Achor that so stale against gods byheste. And god said till when his theft
was punysshed the people should never have speed in battle ne in other
Iourneye. Dives. It is than little wondre that our folk speed evil these
days in war upon their enemies / for they go more to rob and to pyle than
to fight for any right. Pauper For that sin and many other they speed full
evil. For they be so blent with sin yt the light of grace by which they
should be wyssed in there deeds is hyde away fro them and so they wandre forth
among their enemies as blind bestes / and for they seen no myscheef till they
fall there in. For as the wise man says. Obcecauit eos malicia eorum.
Sap^.ij. There malice has made them blind. A great clerk tells Solinus de
mirabilibus mundi. That in the land of Sardynye is a well / of the which
well if a true man drink his sight shall amend. But if a thief drink thereof
/ though his sight be before never so clear he shall wexe blind. By this well
I understand plentee of worldely goods and of rychesses ye god sends
among mankind / which goods and rychesses comen of the earth and newen year
by year as water in the well / and al true folk that drynken of this well /
that is to say / that comen truly to their good and rychesses of this world /
and spenden them well to the worship of god and profit of their even christian /
they have more light of grace to see what is to do and what may please god.
And they that falsely come to goods of this world by theeft / by gyle and
usure and by falls oaths they wexen blind / for they lose the light of grace
and be blent with there malice. Therefore saint Ambrose super Luca^ says. That in
the tyche s;ses is no blame / but the blame and the defaute is in them that
can not well use their rychesses. And as rychesses says / he is lettynge of
virtue to shrewes / and is help of virtue to good folk y^ can and ben in will
to use well her rychesses. Dives. I dread me that nyghe all our nacyon has so
dronken of this well of Sardynye y^ they ben goostly blind. For if I take heed what theeft of symonye regneth in the clergy / what theft of usure
regneth pryncypaly among marchau tes and rich folk / what theeft of raueyne
and extorcyon regneth among the lords and great men / what mycherye and
robberye among the poor commons that be always enclyned to slay and to rob.
Me thinks that much of our naco^n is gylty in theft and ouerdone much blent
with false couetyse Pauper Therefore god says thus A minimo vsque ad maximu^
omnes sequunt auaricia^. A ppha vsque ad sacerdote cuncti faciunt mendaciu^. et
ideo corruent. Fro the least to y^ most all they folowen auaryce and false
couetyse. From the prophet to the priest all they make lesynges and do gyle
and falsehede / and therefore they shall fall / and I shall give their wymen to
strangers / and their lands and their feldes to other heirs. Jeremy. viij.
And by the prophet Ysaye god vndernameth the gouernoures of the people / both
in temporalyte and in spyrytualyte and says thus. Principes tui infideles
socij furum et cetera. Thy princes ben false and fellows of thieves. All they
louen gifts and follow medes and yeldynge again. For they demed not after the
right / but after y^ men might pay. Ysa.i. Si videbas furem currebas cu^ eo et
cu^ adulteris porcionen and^. If thou see a thief thou ran with him to help
him / as false Iuges in temporalte done these days. And with lechoures and
auouteres thou puttedeste thy part as Iuges in spyrytualte done these days.

Here ends the seventh commandment. And begins the eight. Capitulum
Primu^.
Dives. It is full much to dread that gyle and falsehede shall undo this land
as you say but god of his mercy he do bote. I thank the with all mine heart
/ for thou haste well enfourmed me in keeping of the seventh commandment Now
I pray the for charity that you wylt enfourme me in the eight commau dement.
Pauper The eight commandment is this. Non loqueris contra proximu^ tuum
falsum testimoniu^. That is to say. Thou shall speak no false witness against
thy neighbor. In words as says saint Austen and saint Thomas de veritate
theology libro quinto. God forbyddeth all manner lesynges and hydynge of
treuthe when it should be said. For as the law says. Qui tacet consentire
videtur. He that is still and will not say the treuthe when he should say it
/ he seems y^ he consents to falsenesse. And so by his stylnesse he
witnesses with falsenesse against treuthe and against his neighbor and synneth
dedely with his tongue for that he will not use it to witness the treuthe when
he should. And therefore says saint Austen that both he that hydeth the treuth
and he y^ lies against the treuth ben gylty against this commandment. For why
he that is stylle will not proufyte to his even christian / and he that lies
desires to harm his even christian. In epla ad Casulanu^. For man and woman is
bounden by this commandment not to harm his neighbor with his tongue And
therefore John Crysostome says that not only he is a traitor to the treuthe
that lies against the treuthe / but also he that says not freely the treuthe y^
he ought to say / or not freely defends y^ treuth which he ought to mayntene
and defend. And so all tho that by styllenesse enforce them not to know the
treuthe yt they know and will not be aknowen in due time / they be liars and
false witnesses. Nathelesse leave friend ye shall understand that there is three
manner of stylne s;se. One is anentes god / an other anentes our even christian /
the third anentes our self. The first is wicked when we cesse from due
praysynge of god and thanking for his benefyces The second is wicked when we
cesse from due manner of techynge and vndernemynge of our even christian. The
third is wicked in.ij. manners First if a man or woman for dread or shame / or
for pride will not say thing y^ he should say to plain him of his myscheef
/ and to seek help of soul by shryf^ or good counsel or of body by other
help and by good counsel / but gnawynge and fretynge himself Inward and
will not plain him outward to them y^ would conforte him / and speaks so
much Inward without conforte till he falls in wanehope and shendeth himself
by anger and Inward sorrow. Therefore says saint Gregory li.viij. moraliu^
That much folk when they have wrong / suffren much the more disease Inward
/ for they will not speak it outward. For why says he. If they said peasably
their disease outward with their tongue / sorrow and dysea s;e should pass out
of their heart and out of their conscience. Si illatas inquit molestias lingua
tranquilie diceret a consciencia dolor ^maneret. Sometime men be stylle in
desceyte of other / that they may the more bodily accuse other.

Dives. How many manner ben there of lesynges. proauper Saint Austen li. de
mendaco^ puts.vij. manner of lesynges which ben comprehended in three. Quia
o^ne mendaciu^. vel e^ perniciosu^. vel officio s;u^. vel iocosu^. For every
lesynge or it is such y^ it does harm / and than it is called in latyne
perniciosu^ / that is to say wicked in English. Or it is such that it does
good and none harm / and that is called in latin officiosu^ that is profitable
in English. Or it is such y^ it does neither good ne harm / and that is
called in latin ^ocosum / that is bourdfull in English / as when men make
lesynges only to make folk merry. The first manner that is called perniciosu^
and wicked is always dedely sin. But the two other manner of lesynges ben
venyall sin to the common people. But to men of holy church and to relygyouse
and to all that should be folk of perfecco^n they ben dedely sin if they ben
done by auysement or by custom as saint Austen says. The first manner of
lesynges is done in five manners. First if any man say preche or teache any
thing against ye faith of holy church / the.ij. is when the lesynge harmeth
some and profyteth to none as lesynges of bacbytynge and falls wytne s;se of
sin y^ common law punysshed / the.iij. is y^ so profyteth to one and harmeth
to an other / as falls witness in cause of debt or of heritage / or of such
other / the.iiij. is when the lesynge is made without profyt and without cause
/ save only for liking to lie and to desceyue and for custom of lesynges
the.v. is when the lesynge is made only for to please / as flaterynge. All
these manner of lesynges ben forboden by this commandment to all mener folk
as dedely sin. The lesynge of flaterynge may be done in three manners / in
praysynge a man in thing that he has more than he is worthy to be praised /
or praysyng him in a thing y^ he has not / or praysynge him and flaterynge
hy^ in his sin and shrewednesse and in his folly. And this manner of flateryng
if it be done wyttyngly it is dedely sin. The second manner of lesynge y^ is
called Officio su^ and profitable / it is done in.iij. manners. First for
saluaco^n of catel that should else be lost wyckedly by thieves if they wyste
where it were. Also for saluaco^n of man or of woman in nocent that is sought
of his enemies Also to save man or woman fro sin as if a syngle woman say y^
she is a wife / to keep her clean from them that would defoule her. Such
manner of lesynges that so avail and profit / and also lesynges bourdfull ben
venyal sins to ye common people / but to men of perfecco^n they ben dedly
sin / namely lesynges bourdfully when they ben in customable use. For it
falls not to men of holy church and of relygyon to be Iapers ne liars / but
it falls to them pryncypally to flee ydell words. For christ says in the
gospel that men shall give answer at y^ do me for every ydell word y^ they
say But such lesynges bourdful in men of perfecco^n turn lightly to
lesynges pernycyous and wicked. For they do harm to them y^ here them / in yt
yt they be asclau^dred of their vanyte and of their lesynges. For them thinks
and soth it is that men of holy church and of perfeccyon should not be Iapers
ne liars ne vain / but sad in chere in word and deed. Therefore the master
of sentence li.iij. distinct.xxxviij. says openly yt such manner lesynges ben
venyal sins to them that be of imperfect state / and dedly sin to them that
be of perfyte state. And saint Austyn li^ ^tra mendaciu^ says yt teruth should
not be corrupt for any temporal profit. And no man ne woman shall be led to
endless health with help of lesynges / for every lesynge and falsehede is
against christ that is soueray ne truth. And saint Gregory li.xviij moraliu^
says thus. Os quoth mentit occidit ai^am. The mouth y^ lies sleeth the soul.
And the prophet says. Lord you shall lose all that speak lesynges And
therefore says he men of perfecco n must with all business flee lesynges / in
so much yt for saluaco^n of any man's life they should not lie to help an
others body in harming of their own soul. And therefore god says. Non
menciemini et no^ decipiet vnusquisque proximu^ suu^. Leuitici.xix. Lie ye not
and no man desceyue his neighbor.

Dives. Contra. We read in holy wryt Exodi.i. that Pharo assygned to the wymen
of Israel two mydwyues Sephora and Phua / and badde them slay all the childern
males and keep the wymen. But they for the dread of god and for pity did not so
but saved both male and female and with a lesynge excused them to the king and
said / that wymen of Israel could better help themself than wymen of Egypt
and had childeren or they come to them. And as holy wryt says there / therefore
god gave them house and land. Pauper Not for the lesynge but for they dred god
/ and for the dread of god they saved the childern. Therefore god gave them house
and land / and not for the lesynge / and so says holy wryt. Nathelesse some
clerks say that for her lesynge god changed the endless mede y^ they had
else be worthy in to temporell mede of house and land. Dives. Yet co^trate We
find in the gospel that after yt christ was risen from death to life / he
went with two of his dyscyples Cleophas and an other in the lyknesse of a
pilgrim and spoke with them of his death and of his passion / but they knew
him not. And at even when they came to ye castle of Emaus / he feigned him to
go ferther. And yet at their prayer he went in with them. But faynyng as saint
Austen says is a manner of lesynge / therefore not every manner of lesynge is
sin. Pauper It seemed to their sight that christ had feigned / not by false
faynynge Inward in deed as he showed outward / for he was fer fro there faith.
And therefore he showed him outward as a stranger and a pilgrim passing /
for they knew him not ne byleued not in him steadfastly. Also by yt doing he
showed that he should pass forth bodily out of this world and goo above all
heuens. Dives. We find Gen^.xxvij. That Jacob in desceyte of his fader yt was
blind and in fraud of his brother Esau said to Ysaac his fader to have his
blyssynge. I am Esau thy first sone / and that was false / and yet god
approved his deed. Therefore than it seems y^ every lesynge is sin. Pauper
That Jacob did was figure and prophecye of thing y^ should fall. And for y^
prophecye is done in deed / therefore it was no lesynge. For though he were not
his first sone in birth / yet he was his first sone in dygnyte by ordinance
of god y^ ordained / that the people coming of Jacob should be sovereign to
the people coming of Esau. And that the great byhest of crystus birth made to
Abraham and Ysaac should be fulfilled in Jacob and not in Esan as their fader
wend yt it should have be. And though Esau were the first sone and pryncypall
to Ysaac by the dome of Ysaac / yet was Jacob his first sone and his pryncypal
sone by the dome of god. And though he were not Esau bodily in person / yet he
was Esau in dygnyte Dives Contra. His fader Ysaac said yt he came gylefully and
took his blessing. Pauper Ysaac said as he wend / but not as it was. For he
knew not than the will of god in y^ doing / for it was no gyle ne falsenesse
in Jacob For it was not the deed ne the speech of Jacob / but it was the deed
and y^ speech of the holy ghost y^ wrought in hy^ and spoke in him. And
therefore christ said to his dyscyples. It ben not ye that speak / but the holy
ghost of your fader in heaven speaks in you. And so he spoke in Jacob and
Rebeca his mod that cou^seyled him so to get his faders blessing.

Dives. Saint Austen says that lesynge and lyenge is not only in feigned speech
but also in feigned deeds. Pauper Saint Austen says not that all feigned deeds
ben lesynges and sin / but he says that all feigned speech in falsehede is
lesynge and sin For man has more free might to govern his speech than to
govern his deeds / for always a man may speak as he will / but he may not
always do as he will. And the phylosophre says. prio. periarminias. that
speech is token of thoughts in the heart. For it is ordained that man by his
speech should show thing to be or not to be as he feleth and thinks in his
heart. And therefore christ says in the gosspell. Sit sermo vester est est. non
non Be your speech ye ye / nay nay. That as it is in the heart / so it be in
the mouth / that ye of the mouth be ye of the heart / and nay of the mouth
be nay of the heart / so yt the mouth and the heart must always accord. For
as saint Austen says in libro ^tra men daciu^. The mouth bears witness to
the heart And therefore if man or woman say otherwise than it is in his heart /
he bears false witness against his heart and against himself and does against
the commandment of god y^ byddeth hy^ say no false witness against his
neighbor ne against his next / y^ is his own heart and his soul. An other
reason is this / for deed is not ordained pryncypaly to be wytnes to y^ thought
of man's heart / but it is ordained to y^ profyt of the doer and to y^ profyt
of his neighbor and to the worship of god. And therefore when faynynge in deed
is profitable to the doer and to his even christian and to the worship of god /
it is lefull and in case full medefull. And therefore Dauyd when he was among
his enemies in peril of death / medefully feigned him to be wood / so to save his
life to the worship of god and the profit of his nacyon and of his friends and
of his enemies that should else have fallen in manslaughter Pri^. regu^.xxi.
But speech is ordained of god pryncypaly for to be true wytne s;se of thought
in heart. And therefore who so says otherwise than it is in his heart and in his
conseyence he synneth / for he mysused his speech against the order of kind
ordained of god. Dives. Sythen faynynge of deed is not always sin / as
faynynge of speech / tell me when it is sin and when not. Pauper Faynynge in
deed is done sometime by slyght for a good end. As we read in the fourth book
of kings. iiij. Regu^.x. That Ieu the king of Israel did call to gydre all the prestes of the false mawmet Baall in to a certain day / as though he
would have made a great solempnyte and worship to Baall / and did clothe all
the false prestes in one certain clothe y^ he gave them / that by the
clothing men should know them from other. And when they were all gadred
togydre in their temple to worship Baall / the king Ieu bad men of arms go and
slay them all / and so they did. Also Iosue leder of gods people feigned
flight to dysceyue gods enemies. Iosue.viij. Such faynynge so that it be do
without lesynge of the mouth is lefull and in case medefull. Also there is
faynynge for good techynge. And so christ feigned him to go ferther to styre his
dyscyples to hospytalyte. Also there is faynynge of sygnyfycacyon / and so Jacob
as by man's dome feigned him to be Esau. But in gods ^ome it was no faynynge
of falsehede / but figure showed by holy ghost that spoke in him and wrought in
him. Also there is faynynge of falsenesse and of doubleness for to dysceyue /
and such is in ypocrytes and false folk. And all such fayny^ge is lesynge
and forboden of god by this commandment.

Dives. Is it any sin to believe a thing that is false. Pauper There is
falsehede of the sayer / and falsehede of ye thing that is said. Falsehede of
ye sayer sometime is pernycyous and wicked / and to believe lightly / such
falsehede it is dedely sin and dampnable. Sometime falsehede of the sayer is
profitable as touching worldely things and not noyous as to the world / and
sometime it is neither profitable ne noyous to the world / as lesynges made
only for bourde yt harmeth no man worldely ne profyteth. And to believe tho two
manner of falsehedes it is venyall sin Also there is repronable falsehede of a
thing yt is said. And either that thing longs to the nedefulnesse of our
salutacyon as be artycles of the faith and to believe such falsehede it is
dedely synue / or it longs not to the nedefulnesse of our saluaco^n and to
believe such falsehede lightly it is veny all sin or else no sin / as
says Dockynge super Deutron^. Nathelesse there should no wise man be to hasty
to believe things of charge that should either be great prosperyte or great
aduersyte. For the wise man says. Qui cito credit leuis e^ cord. He that
soon byleueth is light of heart and unstable. Eccl.xix. And therefore says he
/ believe not every word that men tell the. Ibidem. The fool simple man says
he byleueth every word / but the wise man takes head to his paas / and goth
ne byleueth not chau^g^ably after me^nes speech ne after lesynges but after the
law of god that is not chau^geable. Prouer.xiiij. et Eccl. xxxiij. Dives.
Sythen it is so that a man may sin berynge false wytne s;se of himself /
whether synneth he more praysynge himself falsely / or lacking himself
falsely. proauper Both ben folly / and in case great sin For Caton says. No^
te collaudes necte culpaueris ip^e. Praise you not thyself ne lack you not
thyself. And Solomon says. Laudet te alienus. et no^ os tuu^. Extraneus et no^
labia tua. Let an other man praise the and not thyn own mouth / strangers and
not thy lyppes. Prou.xxvij. And therefore by common opinion of clerks it is more
sin a man to praise hy^self falsely by auau^tement than it is to lack
hy^self falsely For auau^teme^t comes of pride yt is worst of all sins / but
lackyng of hy^self may come of lowness medefully For every man of himself is
more to lack than to praise. And therefore says y^ prophet. Omnis homo men
dax. Every man and woman of hy^self is false and a liar. And Solomon says yt
no man wot whether he is worthy love or hate of god. And so no man wot what
he is worth in gods syghte / and as much as he is worth in gods sight so
much he is worth and no more. Therefore says Arystotle.iiij. Ethicorum. That
ye auau^ter of himself is worse than the lacker of himself. Iactator
vituperabilior e^ quod vitupator Et ide^ dicit Ricardus de media villa super
sentencias li.iij. di.xxviij. q^.iiij. Dives. Which ben called by the law
false witnesses. Pauper They that been brought to bear witness and ben sworn
to say the sothe and do against their oath / saying false or hydynge the
treuth and thing that should be said / or transpose things that should be
said. Or a man say a thing for certain that he is not syker of though it be
treuth yt he says. And also he is false witness that swereth a treuth with
slyght speech for dysceyte. Such manner folk saint Austen lykeneth to Judas /
and much folk says he these days despise the deed of Judas / and yet they
do the same yt he did / or else worse. For why says he. All tho that for
mede bear false witness they selle christ yt is sovereign treuth for mede. Et
e^ super illud Math. Quid vultis michi dare et ego eum vobis tradam. But such
false witnesses be worse than was Judas. For he sold christ for thrytty pens.
But many false witness selle christ for much less / and sometime for naught
only to show malice or to be venged. Judas made restytucyon of the money
that he took to betraye christ and would not rejoice it. But false witnesses
these days make no restytuco^n but live by such false sinful lucre. Judas
byleued not y^ christ should rise fro death to live and deem the quycke and the
deed. But we believe that he rose from death to live and shall come to deem all
mankind verry god and verry man. And therefore christian men false witnesses ben
more to blame than was Judas.

Dives. May all manner men bear witness in any dome. Pauper Nay. For bound
servants should bear no witness in causes of their lords / neither against
them ne with them / but in as much as the cause touches other of his seruau
tes.iiij. q^.iij. S. criminali. v. Item serui. Ne wymen should bear no witness
of preef in causes of felonye / but in matrymonye and in causes of purgacyon of
wymens evil name / they may bear witness of preef. And wymen may accuse in
causes of felonye. Also no young folk within.xiiij year / ne foles / ne
beggars / ne full poor folk / ne hethen men / ne christian men openly loosed of
falsehede / or ones teynt false and forsworen / ne open wicked lyuers and of
evil name / none of these is able to bear witness in dome before a Judge.v.
Condicio sexus etas discrecio fama. Et fortuna fides in testibus ista require.
By false witnesses the Jews slew saint Steven / and by false witnesses they
slew Christ and by false witness the true man Naboth / and by false witness
they would have slain the holy woman Susanna / but god saved her and brought
the false witnesses to the same death / that she should have had if her witness
had been true / and that was the law that time / and yet it is in many lands
And if they dysheryte any man or woman / or do him lose onythynge by false
witness / they ben bounden to restytucyon. Also bacbyters forfet against this
commandment ^hiche by malice bacbyten them that been good / and by lesynges
dyffame ^^ym. Also flaterers yt falsely praise them y^ be wicked / so to favor
them in their sin. And so both the bacbyter bacbytynge the good man / and the
flaterer praysynge y^ wicked man have gods curse / that he gives to all
such thus saying. Ve qui dicunt bonu^ malu^. et malu^ bonu^. Woe be so all them
that say the good wicked / and wicked good. Ysaye.v. And namely they that been
nyghe to lords and to great men and ben their governors or there counseyllours
or confessors and to please them and to flater them be it never so false /
and take none he de to god ne to treuthe / but only to please / and say nay
or ye / not after the treuth is / but after the lord will have it and so
harden him and blynden him in his folly. Such flaterers be lykeneth to a be
yt is called Cam^lyon / which be chau^geth his color after the things y^
be besides him / now white / now black / now read / now grene / now blewe /
now yelowe. Right so such flaterers change their speech after yt they hope
best to please there lords and other men. For now they speak good of a man why
le the lord is his friend. And if he fall enemy to him / anon they speak
him harm and velonye so to please the lord and other also that been y^ man's
enemies. In presence of his friends they speak a man good though they will him
no good / and in presence of his enemies they speak him evil. And as the fane
of the steple turned after the wind / so torn flaterers and bacbyters their
speech as company speaks that they ben in. The mosell and the face of the
Camelyon is like a swyne and an ape. For eue^y flaterer is a bacbyter. And as a
swyne has more liking to lie in a foul slough than in a fair grene / and
with wrotynge of his snoute defouleth the place there he gooth / so has the
bacbyter more liking to speak of other men's defautes and of their vnhonestes
and sin / than to speak of their goodness and honest and wisely speech
wrotynge upon their defautes to appear and defoule their good name And in that
he is a flaterer he is like the ape / that what he sees other men do he will
do the same. For flaterers rule their tongue not after the treuth / but after
the pleasaunce and speech of other men. But this be Camelyon though it be
fair while it is a live / yet as soon as it is deed it is full foul / as
says the master of kind. Right so such flaterers and fair spekers ye speak
well and do full evil / all though they seem fair and worshypful in this
world / in the other world after their death they shall be full foul and
fendes fellows in hell pain / but they amend them. And all y^ speak well and
do not thereafter forfet against this commandment. For they deny by their
deeds the treuth yt they say with their mouth. Of such saint Poule says / y^
with their mouth they knowledge themself to know god / but with there deeds they
deny it. Confitent se nosse deu^ factis aute^ negant. Tite.i. And therefore god
warns folk of such false witnesses that speken the treuth with their mouth
and d^nye it in deed / and says thus. Omnia quecu^que dicerint nobis facite.
scdm vero opera eorum nolite facere. Math.xxiij. All thing that they bydde
you do / do ye it. But do ye not after their wicked works.

Caplm.vij.
ALso these men of law that for mede mayntene falsehede against the t^^uthe /
or for mede hyde the ^^euth that they should mayntene / or ^or mede withdraw
them to suffer or let falsehede have his forth / they forfet against this
commau dement which forbedeth al manner falsehede. I read on a time there were
two men of law dwelling in own town. The one at even came home from the
assyse / and y^ other ared him what he had won yt day. And he said.xx mark
and that he had right much travail therefore. Ye said the other / and I have
won as much and more to be at home and not to travail. Such men of law
and batteres of law that have no conscience may well say that is written in
the book of Ysaye the prophet. Concipimus et locuti sumus de cord verba
mendacij and^. We have conceived by study and by good enformacyon knowing of
the treuth / and of our own heart and of our contryuynge we have spoken words
of lesynge and of falsehede. And therefore ryghtfull dome is turned bacwarde /
and ryghtfulnesse stood from far and might not nyghe treuth fell down in y^
street / and equity might not enter / the treuth is all forgeten. And he y^
went away fro wicked thing and would have lived in pea^ and treuth / he was
open pray to false men. Qui recessit a malo prede patuit Ysaye.lix. But would
god that they would amend them / and say that is written the same chaptre.
Lord god our sins ben multeplyed by fore the / and our sins answer to us
for our great sins ben with us and accuse us. We know our witnesses / for we
have sinned and lied falsely against our lord god. We turned us away and
would not go after our god to follow him in treuth / but spoke against him
falsehede / and passing of gods law for to endaunger the simple folk. Also
prechours of gods word yt preche more for winning of worldely good / than
for winning of man's soul and seek more their own worshypp than gods
worship in their prechynge and preche not the treuth / ne will say men their
sothes in repreuy^ge of their sins / they ben false wytne s;ses and do against
this commandment For if they hyde treuth in favor of sinners and will not
preche against their vices. Or if they preche fallehede and error to show
their wit by curyoust speech / or preche high matters not profitable to the
people / not helpely to man's soul / all such prechours ben called false
witnesses. Also they that preche so hard against the mercy of god that they
bring folk in wanehope. And also they that preche so much of the mercy of
god and so little of his ryghtwysnesse / that they make folk to bold in sin
/ such prechoures ben false witnesses of christ. For all his mercy is meddled
with ryghtwysnesse / and all his ryghtwysnesse is meddled with mercy. Therefore
Dauyd says. Universe vie dni^ mia et veritas All the ways and the domes of
our lord god ben mercy and treuthe. Deus iustus et misericors. God is
ryghtfull and he is mercyable to all that will amend them. All prechoures of
gods word should be witnesses of Christ that is sovereign treuthe. And
therefore christ says to his dyscyples. Eritis michi testes in jerusalem and^.
Ye shall be witnesses to me in Jerusalem and in all Iurye / and in Samarye /
and in every land to the last end of the earth. Actuum.i. And therefore
prechours should auyse them well that they preched no falsehede / ne say no
thing for certain that is in doubt to them / and that they hyde not the
treuth y^ should be said / and that their life and their techynge accord with
the techynge and the life of christ. For if they teache otherwise than christ
taught / and live not as christ lived they ben false witnesses to christ.
Christ taught chastyte and commended pouerte and lowness. And therefore if the
prechour of gods word be a lechour and a carnal man proud of heart and
covetous / he is not true witness of christ. And if he repreue in his deeds
pouerte and chastyte and say that christ was not poor for man's sake / he
lies upon christ / and he is to him ouerdone false witness. For Christ said
that foxes had their dens / and the birds her nestes / but the maidens
sone had not where he might rest his head. Mathei.viij. And saint Poule
says / that Christ bycame man nedy for us in this world to mak^ us rich with
his myschefe. Propter nos egenus factus est.cu^ esset dives. vt illius inopia

ALso al mynystres of holy church / and namely men of relygyon should be
witnesses of christ to edyfycacyon of the people and of their neighbors / y^
ben all men and wymen. And therefore men of holy church ben betokened by galaad
/ that is to say an hope of witness. For all their living in heart in word in
work and in clothing should bear wytnes to christ. Dives. How should men of
holy church bear witness in clothing to christ. Pauper. For in clothing
they should show sadness hone s;te and lowness / as nygh folowers of christ
/ and witnesses yt taught sadness against vanyte / honest against glotony and
lecherye / lowness against pride / and pouerte against couetyse. And therefore
the outclothynge of men of holy church / and namely of men of relygyon should
not be to strayte ne to short to show the shap of their body / for pride and
vanyte and to tempte wymen / ne to precyouse against pouerte / ne ouerdo ne
feeble against their degree / and honest of holy church / ne to side ne wide
against measure. Dives. Of this matter thou spakest before. I coueyte no more to
here thereof. For as you sothely saydest men of holy church and namely men of
relygyon pass in great arraye and pomp temporal lords. Pauper Also as often
as the priest syngeth his mass / he represents the person of christ yt dyed
for us all upon the tree. And by his clothing and by his mass singing he
hereth wytne s;se of crystus passion / and shows yt all yt he does in saying
of his mass / he does it in mind of crystus passion and if he have no mind
of crystus paslyon after that his clothing shows that he should be / he is a
false witness in disceyte of his neighbor Therefore saint Gregorye says that
no man does more harm in holy church / than he that has a name and order of
holiness and lives wyckedly Nemo amplius nocet in ecclesia. quod qui perverse
agens nomen et ordine^ sanctitatis habet. Dives. What betokens the clothing
of the pressed at mass. Pauper The amyt on his head at the beginning betokens
ye cloth yt crystus face was hyled with in time of his passion when the Jews
hyled his face and bobbed him / and badde him arede who that smote him. The
long aube betokens the white cloth that Herod cladde christ with in scorn
as he had been a fool. The fanon the stole and the gyrdell betoken the bounds
which christ was bounden with as a thief in time of his passion The fanon
betokneth bounds of his hondes. The stole the rope yt he was led with to his
death. The gyrdell the bounds that he was bound with to the pyler and to the
cross. The chesyble betokens the cloth of purpure in which the knights
clothed him in scorn / and kneled to him and said in scorn. Hayle thou king
of Jews. The bishop passing other priests has a mytre and a cross. The
mytre on his head betokens ye crown of thorns ye christ bare on his head
for man's sake. And therefore the mytre has two sharp horns in token
of.ij.sharp thorns. The two tongues yt hang down on the mytre betoken the
stremes of blood yt ran down fro crystus head by pryckynge of the crown of
thorns. The cross that the bishop bears in his hand / betokens the read
spear yt the knights tourmentours put in the hand of christ in scorn for a
ceptre. And the Archebysshoppes cross betokens the cross that christ dyed
upon for us all. The bysshoppes gloves at mass in his hondes / betoken the
nails in crystes hondes / and the sandalyes on his feet at mass betoken y^
nails in crystes feet. If it be so than yt men of holy church having these
tokens of crystes passion in their mass saying / and have no deuoco^n in
crystes passion ne mind of his passion they bear false witness / for it is
not with them Inward as the tokens show outwdrde Also the amyt betokens ye
basynet of health that is hope of the life y^ is to come / and forsakynge of
erthely things The long aube betokens chastyte of body and soul. The
gyrdell fanon and stole betoken the commandments and the counseyles of
Christ in the gospel / by the which men of relygyon and of holy church ben
bounden passing other to serve god. The ^hesyble betokens the holy cloth of
christ without seem all won in one which betokens parfyght charity. The
mytre on the bysshopes head with y^ horns betokens co^nynge of two testamentes
old and new which conning he ought to have and to teache with two tongues / with
tongue of deed and with tongue of speech and show them both in deed by good
example gyuynge / and in speech well techynge / and y^ betokens the two
tongues hangyng behind on the mytre. And the same betoken the two tongues
hangyng behind on the aube on the prestes sholder. For every priest should
conne gods law and preche it with tongue of deed and good example / and with
tongue of speech These two tongues hang higher on the bishop than on the simple
priest in token y^ the bishop is more hyghly bound to y^ tongues of good
example and good techynge than the simple priest. Dives. It is a common saw y^
tho two tongues on ye prestes sholdre betoken yt this land has been twyes
renegate and perverted. Pauper That is false. For sith this land took first
the faith / y^ people was never renegat But ye people of this land was slain
nygh all up for the faith till there was no christian man to dwell therein but
only hethen people y^ has slain christian people / and by ye sword kept this
land y^ they wanne of christian people Therefore Beda de officio diuino sayh y^ it
betokens two tongues y^ men of holy church ought to have as I have said / and
therefore they ben called tongues Also y^ prestes crown betokens the crown of
thorns on crystes head and the dygnyte of the presthode. And his sha^ynge as
the law says / betokens pouerte in soul / and forsakynge of worldely
goods.

Caplm.ix.
Dives. What betokens the bysshoppes cross in manner of living. Pauper As
says a great clerk Beda li.i. de diu^ no officio. The bishops cross is
called a shepherdes staff / to styre the bishop to lowness / and to think on
the cure and on the business and the charge that he takes upon him when he is
made bishop. He bears no ceptre of worldely dygnyte to styre him to pride /
ne bears no sword that is token of cruelte / but he bears a shepherdes staff
/ not to slay ne to smite / but for to save his sheep / y^ ben his suget^
spyrytually / which staff above is crooked in manner of an hoke / to draw again
yt would not come / or else go away. For the bishop should pryncypaly
travail to draw synful men and wymen with fayrenesse by good words and by
good example to the mercy of god / and not to be fers^ne fell to the sinful.
And therefore as Beda says / above on the hoke of the cross is written thus
about. Cum iratus fueris misericordie recordaberis. When thou shall be wroth
thou shall think on mercy. In the round knott byneth the hoke is written.
homo. that is to say / a man / to do the bishop think y^ he is but a man
as an other is / and not be proud of his dygnyte. Byneth beside y^ pyke of
iron is written parce / that is to say spare. For he must spare his sugettes
and show grace to them as he will have grace of god. And in token thereof the
pyke of the cross should not be sharp but blunt. For the deem of y^ bishop
should not be to sharp / but always meddled with mercy. The staf of the cross
is right and not wrong / in token that the bishop should deem ryghtfully and
govern his sugettes in right and equity / and do no man wrong. Vnde versus.
Contrahe per primum. medio rege.parce per ymum. By these tokenes outward
bysshoppes and pre^es witness themself to be such In ward as the tokenes
show. But if they be not such / they be false wytne s;ses to christ and to
crystus lore in damage of their even christian / for by ypocrely they desceyue
the people. For sothe it is a lesynge any man knowledge himself a bishop /
priest / or clerk or man of relygyon / and work contrary things to his
order / and against the tokenes that he bears of holiness It is a lesynge any
man or woman to say him christian / and do not ne live not thereafter as a
christian man or woman / but perauenture worse than a Jew sarasyne or panyme.
Therefore says saint John in his epistle / that who so says that he knows
god and keeps not his commandments he is a liar / there is no faith in
him. Prima Iohis.ij. And he yt says that he loves god and hate his brother he
is a liar. Io.iiij. And so every wicked liver is a liar. And therefore saint
Ambrose says in this manner. Brethren flee ye lesynges. For all they that
louen lesynges / ben the childeren of the fend. For as christ says in the
gospel / all such have the fend to there fader / which has ever be a liar
and fader of lesynges / and never stood in treuth / but with a lesynge lost
all mankind as christ himself says in the gospel. Io.viij. And yet in to
this day uneaths he brings any man or woman to sin but with lesynges. And
so with lesynges he sleeth man's soul and woman's / and ever has be a cruel
mansleer and a false liar / as christ says in y^ same gospel. Dives Tell me I
pray the how witnesses should have them in dome for to be true witnesses.
proauper The witnesses in dome and the Judge also should be In dyfferent to both
parties and say the treuth for both parties. And the Judge may not by y^ law
take mede to deem truly / ne the witness may not by the law take mede to bear
true witness Much more than the witness ought to take no mede to bear falls
witness ne the Judge to give unrightful dome.xiiij.q^.v. Non sane. Nethelesse
the witness may lefully take his costs of him y^ brings him to witness.
And if a man see y^ his neighbor should fall in his treuth and lose his right
for defaut of wytnes / if he know the treuth and may bear witness in the
cause / but he bear witness and say the treuth for saluaco^n of his neighbor
/ else he synneth grievously though he be not brought to bear wytnes And in y^
case men of holy church may and owen to bear witness / so y^ it be not in
cause of blood ne of grievous sin. And if a man take mede for his witness he
is bound to restytuco^n.

Caplm.x.
Dives. To whom shall he make restytuco^n. proauper If he took mede to bear
falls wytnes / though he bear true witness or no witness / he shall make
restytuco n / not to him y^ gave it / for he is not worthy to have it again sith
he gaf it for falsehede and for sin. But he shall make restytuco^n to him
ayens whom he took it to do him wrong. And in the same manner shall make
restytuco^n if he took mede not to bear witness / but for to be stylle and not
say the treuth. And if the witness take mede to say the treuth / he shall
make restytuco^n to him y^ gave it to him in help of his right. For it was
lefull to hy^ so to give / but it was not lefull to the witness so to take.
And if it be in doubt for what end the gift was given / than he shall make
restytuco^n and give it the poor folk by the dome of holy church. Hec
Raymundus li.ij.ti.de testibus. Dives How many witnesses be nedeful in dome.
Pauper After that the cause is so must be the nombre of y^ witnesses. And
after the person or the persons that been against whom the witnesses ben
brought. For against bysshoppes and prestes and against men of holy church and
against persons of temporal dygnyte must be brought more witnesses and of
more worship than against simple folk. Dives. Why so. Pauper. For there
should no man be in dygnyte / neither spirytual ne temporal / but true folk to
whoos treuth men should give more credence than to speech of simple folk
which known not well what is treuth ne falls what is profitable to the comonte
/ ne what is noyous / and often full little dredynge god. Also persons in
dygnyte in that they be soueraynes and Iuges and governors of the people for
their ryghtfull domes / and sometime for unrightful geten them much hate of
the people / and without gylte and for there good deed / and so they have many
adversaries. For it is not in the power of the governor to please all. But
needs either he must offend god / or else men that dreden not god And
therefore the Judge shall not lightly believe a few witnesses against suthe
persons. Also if persons of dygnyte might lightly be dampened by y^ simple
folk / the people should be to hold against there soueraynes and little let by
them / and so dygnyte both spyrytuall and temporal should be in despyte and
come to naught. And therefore some time it is better to suffer a sh^ewde prelate
or a curate and a shrewde man to regne / than lightly at the request of y^
people to depose him / but his sin be well open and well sclau^derous and
noyous. Dives. Is there any caas in which it is lefull to stand to one
witness. Pauper In y^ is no preiuoyce to an other / it is leful to stand to
one witness / as if it be in doubt whether a child be crystened / or a
church hallowed or an aultre / or vestyme^t hallowed. Also by assent of both
parties men may stand to the witness of one. Also men may stand to y^ wytne
s;se of the priest seeing y^ his parysshen is amended if the sin be not open.
Vt dicit hostiensis i^ su^ma li.ij. Ru. de testibus. S. quotus est numerus Also
the witness shall say for certaynte y^ he knows for certain / and say in
doubt thing that is to him in doubt Dives. Ofce a man weneth to be syker of
thing and he is desceyued Pauper If he do his devour to know the treuth /
though he be desceyued so saying against treuth / he synneth not dedely / for it
is not his will to bear false witness.

Caplm.xi.
Dives. Is a man bound to keep counseyll of a thing y^ he knows by preuy
telling. Pauper. That a man knows only by shryft he is bound to keep it
preuy and no witness here thereof. For he knows it only as gods preuy
mynyster. But if he knew it not only by shryfte / but by other way than by
this telling that is shreuen to him thereof / if it be such that it be great
harm of the comynte / or of any person / than he is bound to tell out for
salvation of his even christian saving as much as he may the person that told
it him / so that he beware of more harm by his telling If it be such that
it be not to harm of the comynte / ne to great harm of any person if he have
bound him to counsel he shall not be it aknowe for no bidding of his
sovereign. For it is a law of kind to keep counseyll that man knows by
cou^seyl / if the keeping of cou^seyl be not against charity For against charity
may no man be bounden neither by byheste ne by oath. And for to dyscouer
counseyll y^ is told them for counseyll when he may lefully keep it counseyll
/ it is a falsehede. And therefore the wise man says. That who so dyscouereth
the preuytees of his friend he leseth faith Ecclesiastici vicesimo septimo. For
that is the manner of false friends / that when they turn to enemytee / than
to tell the preuytees of their friends to shende them. As says the wise man.
Ecclesiastici sexto. Witnesses must accord in the thing and in the person /
the place and in the degree / and in the time. If one witness stand against
many witnesses / his witness is naught but he be written with them in any
Instrument. If the witnesses contrary among themself / the Judge shall deem
after the more party / but the less party pass the other party in worship
and dygnyte and in good name. Or else if their witness be more semely to the
treuth and that they preue better their words than the other party but y^
must stand in dyscreco^n of ye Judge. They y^ shall atteynt other witnesses
must be mo in nombre and of more worship and of better name than the other
were If witnesses ben even in both parties in nombre and in dygnyte / the Judge
shall deliver him y^ stands for gylty / for mercy must be pryncypall virtue
in the Judge. And therefore says saint James y^ mercy enhau^seth the dome. Hec

There is a witness above us y^ knows all and may not be dysceyued / that is
god that sees all / and he shall at the day of dome be to us both Judge and
witness. Ego sum iuder et testis. I am Judge and witness says our lord god.
Jeremy.xxix. And Job says. In heaven is my witness / and he that knows all
my counsel is above in high. And there is a witness within us that is our
conscience. For as saint Poule says. Our Joy is witness of our conscience.
And there is a witness without us / and y^ is our neighbor and all creatures
y^ shall bear witness against us at the dome before ye high Judge but we amend
us by time and deem well our self. For Moses said Testem inuoco celu^ et
terra^. I call heaven and earth to witness / y^ if ye make to you any
likeness / or image to worship it and break gods law ye shall soon
perysshe. Deutro.iiij. And in an other place he says thus. I call heaven and
earth to witness that I have set before you life and death / good and evil
/ blessing and curse. And therefore chese the life that ye may live and love
your lord god and obey to his voice / and clyue to him by faith and love /
for he is your life and length of your days. And your heart be turned away
from / him and ye will not here his laws but worship false gods. I say to
you before that ye shall soon perysshe. Deutro.xxx. And therefore leave friend /
if we will be syker at the last dome and come sykerly before our sovereign Judge
that knows all / we must deem well our self in this world. For saint Poule
says. That if we demed well our self and dyscussed well our life / we should
not be dampened. Pri^. ad Little.xi. Dives. How should we deem our self. Pauper
As the gloss says there. Thou shall be thine own domesman. Thy seete shall be
thine heart / and set thy self gylty before thy self domesman. Thy thought
and thy conscience shall be thy two witnesses for to accuse the Thy
tourmentours should be dread and sorrow / that in manner should she we thy blood
by weeping of salt teeres when by witness of thine own conscience and of thy
thought / thou haste demed thy self gylty and not worthy for to come to gods
board / ne to heuens bliss. And there says the gloss. That sickness /
feblenesse / and sudden death fall commonly after Eester among the people.
For men in Eester resceyue unworthily gods flesse and his blood. Ideo multi
infirmi et imbecilles et dormiunt multi.s. per morte^. Prima ad Little.xi. But
for every man is favorable to himself and to his own cause / therefore thou
shall have with the two assessours by whose counsel thou shall deem thy self
/ and tho shall be treuthe and reasone. Take with the treuthe that thou make no
false excusacyon of thy sin. Ne lie thou not for to excuse thyselfe ne for to
excuse thyselfe falsely ne to grievously / but as thine other assessour reason
will accord. And if tho two witnesses / y^ is to say / thy thought and thy
conscience suffyse not to bear witness / ne to full enfourme the of thy sinful
life Take to the / the thrydde witness / that is thy faith. And so let thy
dome stand in witness of two or of three. And faith says thus. Fides sine
operibus mortua est. Faith without good works is deed. For all though you
believe as a christian man / but thou live as a crystin man / else thou art deed
in soul and worthy to dye without end. Faith that fails in word and in
thought is deed and helps not to bliss. And anon conscience and mind shall
accord to him and say thus. He that uses amys his free will that he dye it
is reason without remedy saving gods mercy. And take heed that thy clergy
may not save the. For holy wryt and clergy say. Anima peccatoris mor^etur The
soul of the sinner shall dye. Also thy clergy may not save the if thou be in
dedely sin. For thou art bygamus and twyus wedded. First to christ in thy
baptym / and after to the fend by assent to sin. And so you art wydowe fro
christ wedded to an other wydowe that is the fend forsaken of god for his
pride to whom he was wedded at the beginning of ye world. Ne trust you not in
thy dome on a good contree. For if the quest common of the.x. commandments
which thou have broken / and of the two commandments of charity against
which you haste offended / and of the.xij. artycles of the faith against which
you haste erred / and of the.vij. deeds of mercy which you haste not fulfilled /
and of thy five wits which you haste myspended / and the four cardynall
virtues against which thou haste trespassed / this solemn queste of.xl. true
witnesses shall dampne the as a man queller of thine own soul. And as a thief
traitor thou haste robbed thine own lord of his good. For robberye is called
al manner mystreatynge of an other man's good against his will. And thou haste
robbed christ of that precious soul that he bought with his dear blood / and
mysused and myspente his creatures against his will. For as saint Gregorye says
in his Omelye. All thing that we take of god to use of good living / we
turn it in to use of wicked living. Quicquid ad vsum recipimus vite. in
vsuque conuert^mus culpe. For the health of body that sent us. we spend it in
sin and in wickedness / fair weder in vain occupacyon of pride and of
couetyse / peace in vain sykernesse plentee of vytayles in glutonye and
lecherye. And so this solemn queste of forty would dampne the for gylty.
Therefore there is none other remedy but truly deem thyself and yield the gylty
and take the to ye mercy of god and punysshe thy self by dread and sorrow of
heart and put the in the dome of gods Judge / that is thy confessor and make
amends after his dome and by his assent. For god against whom you haste so
hyghly offended will stand to his ryghtfull dome / and accept such
satysfacco^n as he assygneth the by y^ law of god to do if thou do it with
good will.

THus deem thou thyselfe / and than shall thou be syker at the dredefull dome
when christ our brother verry god and verry man shall come down to deem the
quycke and the deed. And as saint Poule says. He shall come down with the
voice of a trumpe / that is to say / with the voice of angels and of
archangelles / the which shall cry and say. Surgite mortui venite ad
iudicium. Rise ye up that been deed / and come ye te the dome. And anon in a
twynkelynge of an eye we shall all awake of the long sleep and rise up and
come to the dome. Pope and prince. Emperor and king. Lord and lady / free
and bound / rich and poor great and small / all they shall awake and rise
up body and soul again knytte togydre. That voice shall be so hydeous so
dredefull and stern / that heaven and earth shall begin to quake The stones
shall ryue / and all the deed arise from death to life each man and woman to
answer for himself / no man per attorney. Now our Judge Christ is a lombe
merciful and meke / than he shall be as a lion dredefull and stern. And the
lion with his cry abassheth all other bestes and makes them to stand stylle
save his own whelps / which with his cry he reyseth fro death to life. So
the voice of christ at the day of dome shall arere us all from death to life /
which voice shall be full dredefull to them y^ live bestely and take none head
to god ne to his law. Them it shall arrest and make them stand stylle as
prisoners on the earth and abide their Judge For they shall so be charged with
sin that they shall not wend up against christ as the good shall wend up and
met with christ. For to them y^ ben gods childern that voice shall be full
sweet and full liking to here and make them so light that they shall wend up
and mete with christ in the air / as saint Poule says. To his childern Christ
shall say. Venite and^. Come ye my faders blessed childern and take ye the
kingdom of heaven that was ordained to you before the beginning of the world.
But to these bestyal folk and wicked lyuers / to the proud / to the couetouse
/ to the enuyouse / and to lechoures / glotons / and to vengeable folk / his
voice shall be full dredeful and fnll bitter when he shall say to them.
Discedite a me maledicti and^. Wend ye hens fro me ye cursed wretches in to
the fire of hell without end / there to dwell with the fend and his
angellys And so he shall send them to sorry place and to sorry company without
any remedy. Was there never thondblaste so dredefull as his voice than shall be
to them y^ shall be dampened And was there never song so merry ne melodye so
lykyng as his voice shall be than to all that shall be saved. And therefore deem
well thy self here that thou be not dampened there. Stand here to the saw of
the great queste of true witnesses which I have nempned to the and deem thy
self thereafter. And be true domesman of thyselfe or else you shall have the same
queste against the at the dredefull dome. And thereto all angels and
archangelles and all the saints in heaven and all creatures shall than bear
witness against the and axe vengeance on the Than as says John Crysostom
super illud. Plangent se omnes tribus terre and^. The angels shall bring
forth the cross / the spear / the nail / ye scourges / and the garlonde of
thorns / with which christ suffered his passion. Than shall christ sytte on
high to deem the quycke and the deed / he shall depart the gooe from the
wicked and set the good on the right side / and the wicked on the lift side.
He shall torn him to the wicked on the lift side and show them the cross /
the spear the nails / the scourges / and the garlonde of thorns / and his
wou^des al fresshe which he suffered for all mankind and say to the wicked
on this wise. Ecce miseri et ingrati quanta pro vobis sustinui propter vos homo
factus sum and^. See ye unkind cursed wretches what I suffered for your sake.
For when I was god and king of kings and lord of lords and never had wyste
of woo for your sake I becam man for your sake. I suffered to be beten and
bound / to be spateled and despised / to be nailed to ye cross crowned with
thorns / stongen to the heart with a spear / and was slain dyspytous death as
ye may see to bye you from endeles death. Where is the rau^som of my blood /
where be the souls that I bought so dear / where is the service that ye should
have done to me / where is the love yt ye should have showed to me. I loved you
above al creatures I loved you more than I did mine own worship. For why /
for your love I put myself to sorrow and care. And ye loved more a little
mucke and a lytyl lust of ^he flesh than ye did me or my ryghtfulnesse / and
lytyl or naught would do for my love. For when I was hongrye ye would not feed
me / when I had thirst ye gave me no drink / when I was naked ye hylde me
not / when I sought mine harborowe ye resceyued me not / when I was seek and in
prison ye vysyted me not. And therefore wend ye hens from me in to the fire of
hell without end there to dwell with the fend and his angels. O says
saint Gregorye thou sinful wretch what shall thou do / flee may thou not / ne
hyde the may you not / and if thou appear as needs thou must thou art but shent
/ for there thou shall have all thing against the. Above the thou shall have
the dredefull domesman ready to dampne the. On y^ right side thou shall hane thy
wicked works to accuse the. On y^ lift side the foul fendes ready to draw y^
to hell Byneth the you shall have the endeles depnes ready to swolowe the in /
without the thou shall have all the world on fire ready to brenne the / within
the thou shall have thyn own conscience worste of all / gnawynge the and
fretynge the without end. Than as the wise man says. All creatures shall
fight against us. Sap^.v. Than as the great clerk says Crysostomus. Heaven
earth water son moan night and day and all the world shall stand against us
in wytnes of our sins And though all thing were stylle / our thoughts and
our conscience and our works shall accuse us and stand witnesses against us.
Therefore saint Austen in his Omelye supro illud Estote misericordes says thus.
Brethren take ye head to the mercy of god / and to the hard dome of god. Now
is time of mercy / after it shall be time of dome Now god calls again that been
turned away fro him and forgyueth them there sins that turn again to him /
and he is full pacyent and abides of wretch yt men should turn them to him
and be saved. And anon as sinners turn them again to god he forgyueth sins
yt ben passed and byheteth Joys to coming. Now god s^yreth and monesteth them
yt ben slow to good deeds / he conforteth them that been dyseased / he techeth
them that be studyouse / and helps them that fight against vices. He forsakes
no man ne woman that trauayleth to do well if they call to him. He gives to
us that we should give again to him to please him when we have offended him. For
we have not given him ne wherewith to queme him but yt we take of him. The time
of mercy is full great. I pray you brethern al let ye not this time pass you
/ but take ye it while ye may. After this time shall come time of dome when men
shall do hard penance without fruit / for it shall not help them. Than
sinners that had their wealth in this world shall syghe and say with great
sorrow. Quid nobis profuit su^bia and^ What has prouffyted to us pride / what
has now helped us our pomp / our boost / our rychesses. All these ben passed
away right as a shadow. These ben the words of saint Austen.

Caplm.xv.
THan they y^ shall be dampened shall say a saw of sorrow y^ never shall have
end. Defecit gaudiu^ cordis nri^ vsus e^ in luciu^ chorus nr^. cecidit corona
capit nri^ ve nobis quia peccauimus. The Joy of our heart is done and past
away to sorrow and care is turned our play / the garlonde of our head is
fall to ground / that ever we did sin well away the stou^de. Trenorum.iiij.
Therefore leave friend take we to us the time of mercy and amend we us while we
may for else we shall not when we would And the longer ye god suffers folk
to regne in their sin / and the more pacyence yt he has with them / the
harder he shall smite them but they amend them. And therefore ye dome of god is
lykened to a bow / for the bow is made of.ij. things / of a wrong tree and
a right string. So the dome of god is made of two manner folk. Of them that been wrong thorugh sin and live wronfully and do much wrong / and of them
that be right and ryghtfull in living. The archer shetynge in this bow is
christ. And the more y^ the bow is draw abacke / the harder is smyteth when
the archer louseth. So the longer y^ christ abides / and so draws his dome
abake / the harder he shall smite but folk amend them And as the archer in his
shetynge takes the wrong tree in his lift hand / and the right string in
his right hand and draws them atwynne / so christ at the dome shall set the
wrong lyuers on his left hand / the ryghtfull lyuers on y^ right hand / and
set the arowe in his bow / yt shall be the dreadful sentence of his dome / and
draw ye rightful from ye wrong / the good from the wicked / when he shall
say to the ryghtfull. Come ye with me up in to heuens bliss without end / and
to ye wrong lyuers he shall say / go ye hens from down in to hell pain
without end. Of this bow the prophet says Arcu^ suu^ tete^dit and parauit
illu^. God has bente his bow and made it ready / and he has arrayed or made
ready there in tacle of death / and has made his arowes hot with brennynge
things. For they yt ben burnt with sin shall brenne with the fire of hell
without end Of this bow Dauyd also says Dedisti metuentibus te
significaco^em. vt fugi^t a facie arcus. Lord you have given a tokenynge to them
y^ dread the to flee away from ye face of ye bow.

Caplm.xvi.
Dives. What tokenes ben tho Pauper. There is dome in specyal / and dome in
general / that shall be in the last day of this world. Dome in special
each man has anon as he dyed. And therefore christ says. Nu^c iudiciu^ e^
mu^di. Now is dome of the world / for anon as you art deed you shall be demed
either to heaven or to hell or to purgatory. Of this dome speaks Solomon.
Memor esto iudicij mei. Have mind of my dome / for such shall be thy dome /
yesterdaye it fell to me / to morrow it shall fall to the. Before this dome
go many tokenes of warning to sinful wretches / as age / sickness /
feblenesse / dasewynge of sight / blyndnesse deefnesse rymplynge or revelling
of skin / fading of color / faylynge of mind / loss of catel of friends
by death and other. Dives. When shall y^ day of general dome fail. Pauper
Christ says in the gospel there is none angel ne saint in he^en that wot
when it shall fall. But suddenly and unwarily it shall fall / and come as a
thief and as death does to many a man yt will not beware by tokenes before. No
more shall than man blent with sin be ware of the last dome ne of the first
y^ shall be death no more than the men would be ware by the prechynge of Noe to
flee the flood that drenched all save.viij. souls Dives. Sythen each man and
woman is demed anon as he is deed / whereof shall serve the general dome.
Pauper That all men hethen and christian may see the ryghtfull dome of god / not
only in themself but in all other / y^ hethen men may see and know their false
believe for which they ben dampened. And christian men see and know their
unkindness / and how ryghtfully they and all other ben dampened that dye in
dedely sin.

Caplm.xvij.
Man's dome is perverted by four things as says the law.xi.q^.iiij.
Quatuor / by dread / by couetyse of gifts / by hate / by love. But christ he
is almighty / he dredeth no man. He is lord of all / he needs no mede ne
gifts. He hates no good man ne woman / and therefore he shall dampne no good
man ne good woman. He loves all manner right / and therefore he shall do no
wrong. He knows all / and therefore there shall no false witness ne slyght
of men of law desceyue him. Every man shall be there a true witness of his
own dome / for his own conscience shall save him or dampne him. And therefore
leave fr^nde be ye a true witness of your self in this world to save your
self here in time of grace / and than shall ye be a true witness to your
self / to save your self / in time of the dome. False witnesses in this
world haste their ryghtfull doom of dampnacyon in the other world. For they
ben false witnesses to themself and to the other also. As says saint Johan
with the gylden mouth super Matheum opere imperfecte Omelia.vi. There is no man
able to be a true witness to an other man but he be first a true witness to
himself in his own dome. Art the dome god shall axe of us reckoning and
answering of the benefyces that we have taken of him / he shall axe them again
/ in nombre / in weight and in measure. He shall axe of us how often we have
resceyued of his gifts / how much we have resceyued and how we have spente
them. And the lettres and the tails of our conscience shall answer and say
that we have resceyued goods of kind / that is to say of body and of soul.
Also goods of fortune that been temporal goods and temporal rych^sses and
goods of grace that been virtues and conning. Than the sovereign Judge shall
axe of us answer of his benefyces in the plurell nombre saying. Esuriui and^.
I had hongre and ye gave me no mete. I had thryste and ye gave me no
drink. I was naked and ye clothed me not. I sought my harborowe and ye
resceyued me not. I was seek and in prison and ye vysyted me not ne conforted
me not. And sythen the dome shall be so hards to them yt help not their even
christian with their good at need / much more strayt it shall be to them yt
rob their even christian / as to thieves / pylours / extorcyoners / and
manquellers / lechours / and to all wicked doers. Than men shall give answer of
every ydell word yt they speak / as christ says in ye gospel. And as saint
Bernarde says / the rich man shall give answer of every threde in his clothe
/ of every cro^me of bread in his bread skep / of every drop of drink of his
barell and in his tonne and in his vessel. Also christ shall axe reckoning by
hole mesure. For as Christ says in the gospel. Men shall there reken and yield
to the lest ferthynge without forgyuene s;se. And such mesure as men mete here
to other shall be moten aye^ to them / mercy for mercy / hard for hard. Also
god shall than axe of us reckoning in weight of strayt dome / for all our deeds
shall there be weyed by y^ dome of god and of our own conscience and after that
they weye they shall be rewarded / the good in bliss the wicked in pain. Than
ye hand of god shall write in the conscience of every man and woman that shall
be dampened these three words. Mane techel phares. Which three worder he wrote
on the wall of you kings halle Balthazar to his dampnaco^n. Danielis. unto.
Which vysyon appeared to the king in time of the great feast y^ he made in
despyte of god / and made men drink in the vessels of gods temple / which
vessels were hallowed to god / for Mane is to say in english God has
nombred thy kingdom and days of thy reygne and made an end thereof. Techel is
to say / thou art weyed in a balau^ce / and you weyest to little. Phares is to
say / thy kingdom is departed from the. For after the dome the lynful man may
no longer look after the kingdom of heaven which was ordained to him if he
would have deserved it. But than he shall be departed fro y^ kingdom that he
has lost by his folly and go to prison of hell without end which he has
deserved. For than Christ shall say to every man and woman. Toll quod tuu^
est et vade. Take that is thine / and that thou haste deserved and goo thy way
to heaven / if thou have do well or to hell if thou have do amys and not
amended the. Than all wicked christian men shall be demed and dampened / but
hethen men shall be dampened and not demed. For as christ says in the gospel.
He that byleueth not in christ now / he is demed. Some shall be demed and saved
/ as good christian men common lyuers. And some shall be saved and not demed / as
men of perfecco^n. For they shall deem other as Christ says in the gospel. Vos
^ reliquistis omnia and^ Ye that have forsaken all worldely goods for my sake
/ and followed me in pouerte and in perfeccyon / ye shall sytte on.xij. setes
demynge the.xij. kynredes of Israel / that is to say / all that shall be
demed.

Caplm.xviij.
Dives. It is a dredefull thing to think on this dome. Pauper It shall be
more dredefull to here it and to see it / and most for to feel it / and namely
to rich folk that have resceyued many goods of god and not spended them ne
dyspensed them to his worship. And saint Gregory in his Omelye says. The more
ye gifts of god come to a man the more were rekenynges and answer of the
gifts. Therefore saint James speaks to you rich men in this manner. Agite nu^c
diuites and^. Now ye rich men do ye so y^ ye may save your self / weep ye and
wayle ye for your myscheues that shall fall to you but ye amend you. Your
rychesses ben roten your clothes be mothe eten / your gold and silver is
rusted and the ruste thereof shall be witness against you at the dome and ete
your flesh as fire. For ye kept your good so hard from the poor folk /
therefore you have tresoured wrath and wretch to you in the last days.
Iacobi.v. Dives. Well is him that is well deed. Pauper And well is him that well
lives. For as saint Austen says. He that lives well may not evil dye.
Therefore as I said first. Deem well to thy self and of thy self. For as
Solomon says The true witness delyuereth souls of woo both in his own and
in many other. Prouer.xiiij. And as the prophet says. Seek ye up our lord
god with alms deed while he may be found / call ye him while he is nyghe.
Now he is high now he called us to his mercy. Now he may be found benygne and
bonour to all. But after the dome and after our death / he shall be fell and
fyers to us / but we amend us. Than shall we find no mercy but that we
deserve by our life And therefore leave friend do ye as saint Poule says. Dum
tempus habemus operemur bonum ad omnes. While we have time work we good to
all. And the wise man says what good thine hand may do / do it besely while
you might. For there shall be no werkynge reason ne conning / ne wisdom after
thy death to win the mede. Eccl.ix. Therefore christ says in the gospel /
that there shall come a night when no man shall work to win him mede. The
day is our life / the night is our death / for be we deed we may no more work
to win mede ne to amend us.

Here ends the eight commandment. And begins the nynthe.
Capitulum Primu^.
Dives. God send us grace to do as you say I thank the for this enformaco^n
/ for I hope it shall do profit. Now I pray the y^ you wylt inform me in
the.ix. commandment. Pauper. The.ix. commandment is this. No^ ocupisces
domu^ proximi tui. Exo.xx. Thou shall not coueyte thy neighbors good with wrong
/ house ne land. In the.viij. commandments before god forbedeth all wicked
works. In these two last he forbedeth all wicked wylles and consent to
sin. For of wicked will comes evil deed. And therefore christ says in ye
gospel / yt out of the heart comes all manner sin / for without will and
assente of the heart is no sin done. De cord exiunt cogitaciones male /
homicidia / adulteria / fornicaciones / furta / falsa testimonia / blasphemy /
Mathei.xv. Therefore saint Poule says / that couetyse is rote of all evil And
therefore god forbedeth all wicked couetyse both of the world and of the
flesh. Couetyse of the world is called couetyse of the eye in other men's
good. Couetyse of the flesh is called will to lecherye and to glotonye And
right as a wicked wede is clean cleansed out of a land when the rote is drawn
a way / and tylle when the rote is drawn up the land is not clean cleansed ne
well weded And bodily sickness is not well cured ne helyd tylle the rote of
the sickness be thus destroyed. Right so man's soul and woman's may not be
clean clensyd of sin / ne gods law may not be kept / tylle couetyse of the
heart which is rote of all manner sin and of all goostely sickness be drawn
out of the land of man's heart and destroyed. And therefore when god had
given.viij. commandments by which men should flee al wicked works / he put
thereto other.ij. commandments against false couetyse / bidding y^ men should
put wicked couetyse out of heart / for false couetyse is pryncypall letter of
keeping of gods law and rote of al wickedness. Therefore in this
commandment god forbedeth pryncypaly false worldely couetyse / and specially
of things not mouable by themself when he byddeth yt you shall not coueyte thy
neighbors good with wrong house ne land. In the.vij. co^mau deme^t god
forbedeth the deed of all wrongful taking when he byddeth the not stele. In
this byheste he forbedeth all manner wrongful desire and mys couetyse of any
man's good of house / of land / of gold / of silver / of cloth / of corn /
and of all such other things that may not styre themself This commandment
is princypaly against false purchasours / yt for false couety s;e ben besy to
begyle and with falsehede to rob men of house and of land and put them out of
their heritage. To such false purchasours god gives his curse and says thus.
Ve qui cogitatis inutile et operamini malum in cubilibus vestris and^. Woo be
to you that think vnprouffytable thing / and work wycke^d thing in your
beds in the morrow when ye may not sleep. For than they cast gyle and
falsehede against their even christian. They have coueyted other men's f^ldes
says he / and by might take them away from them / and rob them of their
houses / and falsely challenge the man and his house and his heritage. For often
they challenge men for bound / and so enter in to their house and land and
have all their heritage with gods curse. Michee.ij. Also god gives them his
curse by the prophet Ysaye there he says thus. Ve qui coniungitis domum
domui. et agrum agro copulatis and^. Woo be to you that falsely Join house to
house / and couple field to field to the end of the place yt ye may say / all
this is mine and no man has ought within me. Wene ye says god that ye allone
shall dwell upon earth. This false couetyse says he sowneth in mine eeres.
And therefore many a fair house and great shall be forsaken / and no man ne
woman dwell therein. Ysaye unto. And thus the wise man says. Non attingas
terminos paruulorrum and^ Touch not the bounds of the small poor folk to
reave them of their right / and enter thou not in to the field of faderles
childern to put them out of their heritage. For almighty god that is there nyghe
friend shall make their full grievous and full hard against the. Prouer.xxiij.

Caplm.ij.
WE find in holy writ the third book of kings.xxi. ca. That there was a
king of Israel that hight Achab / and there was a man dwelling by him that
hight Naboth that had a fair vyneyerde yt lay nyghe the kings paleys and
therefore the king desired greatly to have it / and said to Naboth / give me thy
vyneyerde / and I shall give the a better therefore / or else asmoche money as
it is worth Than Naboth said / god forbede that I should change my faders
heritage. I will never change it ne selle it. Than the king was wroth and for
malancoly laid him on his bed and would not ete ne drink. The queen
Iesabell his wife come to him and axed what him ayled. The king said that he
had spoken to Naboth to have his vyneyerde / and he would not grant it him.
Than Iesabell the queen said. Bt of good conforte and take me thy ring and I
shall give to the the vyneyerde. Than she wrote lettres in the kings name to
the pryncypales of the cite under the kings sygnet. And badde them gadre their
court to gydre and make a solemn fasting so to blind the people with
ypocresye and badde them ordeyne two false witnesses / which should accuse
Naboth and say yt he spoke evil of god and of the king and so dampne him as
gylty and stone him to the death / and so they did. For it was the law yt who
so spoke evil of god or of the king / or cursed them he should be slain. When
Iesabell had tidings yt Naboth was slain / she came to the king and badde
him rise up and be merry and take the vyneyerde to him for Naboth was deed. And
anon the king rose and went in to the vyneyerde and took it to him. Than at yt
bidding of god. Ely the prophet met with him and said to him in gods name.
Thou have slain and you have yt you coueytest / but I tell the it forsooth in
the same place there yt hou^des have lycked up the blood of Naboth / hou^des
shall lycke up thy blood / and hou^des shall ete thy wife Iesabell / and
hou^des and bryddes shall ete thy body / and god shall destroy thine
household and slay all thy kynrede and thyn alyaunce / and soon after it fell
so. And thus of false couetyse came periurye / false witness / murder and
manslaughter / and destruccyon of the kingdom. We read also in the passion of
saint Beatryce / yt there was a false couetouse man whose name was Lucres. And
he coueyted much y^ place of saint Beatryce And for couetyse to have y^ place
he accused her to an hethen Judge / yt she was a christian woman. And so by his
accusaco^n she was slain. For she would not forsake christ ne crystes law.
When she was thus deed. Lucres entered in to her place to have it in possessyon.
And for Joy of the place he made therein a great feast to his friends. And when
he was most merry and Ioconde in the mids of the feste / a young soukynge
child that was there in his moders arm said all alowde yt all men might here
it. Audilu ^eci Here now Lucres. Thou have s^^ne / and thou haste entered
falsely in to this place and haste it at thy will. But now thou art given in to
the might and in to possessyon of thy most m(...). And anon in time of the
feast ^^fore all his friends and his gest^^^^ fend entered within him / and
three hours togydre so fortrauayled him and so rent him before them all till
he slew him / and for his false couety s;e bare his soul to hell. Here thou
might see what peril it is to purchase any thing amys by false couetyse And
therefore if you have purchaced any thing falsely / or if you occupye any thing
mys purchaced look yt you make restytuco^n for salvation of thy self and of
thine here is. For it is a common proverb De male quesitis vix gaudet tercius
here is. Of evil gotten good the third heir uneath has Joy.

Caplm.iij.
Dives. If I had ought purchaced a mys my self. I hold me bounden to
restytucyon / but of my former faders purchase have I naught to do / whether
it were ryghtfull or not ryghtfull. But that they left to me I will keep it as
the good man Naboth did of whom thou spoke full late. proauper. Naboth would
have kept uylle his faders heritage that longs to him by right and by
dyscente of heritage. But if thou keep any thing wyttyngly that thy former
faders purcha s;ed falsely / in that y^ kepest not thy faders heritage as
Naboth did / but thou kepest other men's heritage / to which neither y^ ne
thy fader had right. And therefore but thou make restytucyon you shall rewe it
and all thine heirs / as Achab did and his heirs / which lost not only y^
they had mysgoten of Naboth by murder and by gyle / but thereto they lost their
life / their worship / and their heritage for ever. I read that there was a
great man which did much alms and for his alms god would have hy^
saved. It byfell in an evening he romed allone under his wood side by his
place / there came an angel in a man's likeness and bad him go with him. Suddenly
they were togydre in a deep valey / and in the mids of the valey was a deep
pytt full of fire smoderynge meddled with pytche and brymstone / full foul
stynkynge. Than the angel badde this man look in to this pytt. He looked down
/ and there he saw three galowes standing in the fire. On the ferthest henge a
man by the tongue / on the second henge a man by the hondes / but on the third
henge no man. Than the angel axed him what he saw / and he told him all the
soth. Than said the angel. He y^ hangs by the tongue y^ is thy faders fader
which purchased the place that thou dwell in by gyle of his tongue by false
oaths / by lesynges / by periurye / by false witnesses / and did many a men
forswere them / and therefore is he pryncypally punysshed in his tongue / and
hangs by his tongue in this horrible fire and shall do without end / for he
would not make restytucyon. He that hangs on the second galowes by the
hondes is thy fader / which kept stylle by mighty hand that his fader amys
purchased and would not make restytucyon. The third galowe in which hangs
no man ben ordained for the but if thou amend the and make restytucyon. Anon
the angel passes away from him / and he was delivered again under his wood
side. The next day after he sent after the heirs of the place and made
restytucyon. His wife and his childern were full sorry and said unto him. Allas
allas now ben we all beggars. Than he answered and said. Lever I have that we
beg in this world / than for to bring you all and me in to that endelesse
pain that I saw. And better it is to us for to lose a place in earth to
which we have no right / than to lose our place in heaven bliss without end.
Dives. I assente well to thy speech / say forth what thou wylt.

Caplm.iiij.
PAuper. Many hard vengeau^ces have fallen for false couety s;e. Giezi was
smyten with foul myselrye. For couetyse made him to selle the health of Naman
/ which health came only by the grace of god.iiij. Regu^.v. For couetyse Judas
sold Christ gods sone for thrytty pens and betrayed him / and after he went
and henge himself tylle his belly brast. And there his belly brast there the
devil that was in him flewe out and bare his soul with him to hell. Dives.
Why went not the fend out of his mouth. Pauper For his mouth had touched
crystes mouth / when he kyssed christ in gyle and said. Hayle master. Dives.
Thy reason is good / say forth what thou wylt. Pauper Also for couetyse Ananya
dnd Saphyra his wife dyed sudden death and despytouse death for they lied to y^
holy ghost / and forsook their money to saint Peter. For couetyse Nachor was
stoned to death / for he stalle gold and clothe against gods forbode.
Iosue.vij. We find in the life of saint Barlaam that on a time an archor took
an nyghtyngale and would have slain it. God gave speech to the nyghtyngale
which said to the archer / what shall it profit to the to slay me. Thou may
not fylle thy womb with me I am so little. Save my life and let me flee and
I shall teache the three wysedomes which if you keep them well they shall do the
much proufyte. Than the archer was a wou^dred of her speech and behyght her
sykerly to let her flee if she taught him the wysedomes. Than she said besye
the not to take a thing that you might not take. For a thing that is lost and
may not be recovered ne gotten again make no sorrow. Thing that is not semely to
be soth believe it not. The archer let the nyghtyngale flee. When the
nyghtyngale was up in the air / she said to the archer a feeble counsel haste
thou take. For you haste lost a great tresour / for I have a Margery stone in
my womb more than an ostriches egg Than the archer was sorry and prayed the
nyghtyngale come again to him and hight her well. Than said the nyghtyngale Now
I wot well thou art a fool and all my lore profyteth the not For thou make
much sorrow / for thou haste lost me / and yet you might not get me again.
Thou trauayleste to take me / and thou might not take me / ne pass the way
that I pass by. And over that you byleuest that I had such a precious stone in
my body as much as an ostryches egg / and all my body is not half so much.
Dives What is this to purpose. Pauper By this nyghtyngale yt syngeth so
swetely I understand Christ gods sone that song to mankind songs of
endeles love. And a nyghtyngale is in latin Philomena / that is to say in
English a sweet lover / as Catholycon says. And a sweter lover than christ
was there never none. He taught to us many wysdomes / in which he taught us
these three. First he bad that thou sholdest not be besye to take thing that
thou might not take / when he bad the not stele / ne coueyte thy neighbors
good with wrong. For as the law says. Hoc solu^ possumus quod de iure
possumus. Only we may do that we may do lawfully And therefore if thou trauayll
to get thing unlawfully yt you might not have by the law / be it house or
land / worship or dygnyte / than you besyest the to get a thing that thou
might not take. And therefore the wyseman says. Noli laborare vt diteris and^.
Trauayll thou not to much to be rich / but put measure and manner to thy
wisdom and to thy slyght / that though you myghtest get a thing by sleyght
or by sotyltee / always take heed to the right and to the law. Ne erigas
oculos tuos ad opes quas habere no^ poteris.s.de iure and^. Lift not up thine
eye says Solomon to rychesses that you might not have ryghtfully. For they
shall make them wings as of an egle and flee in to heaven / that is to say /
they shall flee away from the and accuse y^ before god of thy falsehede and of
thy couetyse. Prouer xxiij. Also couetouse folk do against the second lesson
/ that this nyghtyngale christ Ihesus taught us to keep. For when they lose
thing by myshappe or by aduersyte / or by death of wife or childern they make
so much sorrow yt they renye god / and fall in full hard sickness both of
soul and of body. But Dauyd the king keeping this wisdom did not so / but
while his sone lay seek / as long as he was of hope to have his life / so
long he wept and fasted and prayed for his life to god. But when the child
was deed anon he cessed of his weeping and ete and drank and made merry. For
he wyste well that he might not get him eyes.ij. Regu^.xij. Also couetyse
makes men to leave thing that is not semely to be soth / and to believe many
strong lesynges. For thing that is much desired is soon byleued / as yt
master of stories says. And for as much as couetouse folk desyren to have
much thing yt they have no right to / therefore they believe many fall tales
and assenten to falsehede. For the couetouse and the false accorden soon to
gydre. For if a false man come and tell the couetouse man a false tale of
winning / or tells him that he has right to a thing / he byleueth him
soon be it never so false. But therefore this nyghtyngale blessed Ihesus said.
Qui cito credit leuis est cord and^. He that soon byleueth is light of heart
and full chaungeable from virtue to vice / from treuth to falsenesse / from
charity to couetyse. Et minorabi. And he that soon byleueth shall be lessed in
worship and little set by. For soon byleuynge of lesynges brings people to
much folly This makes men to begin plays and bryges and one neighbor to
hate an other the hnsbonde to ha^te his wife / y^ wife her husbonde / the fader
his sone / the sone his fad / the mother her daughter y^ brother his sister /
this has brought England in bitter balys. Therefore the wise man says. Non
omni verbo credas. Believe not every word. Eccl.xiiij. He yt byleueth soon
lesynges / his word and his love and his faith wawe^ about as the wind.
Therefore the great clerk Seneca says in his epistle / that no wise man
byleueth any new tales lightly.

Caplm.v.
ALso we read in holy wryt. Numeri.xxij. That Balaam the false prophet would
have cursed gods people for couetyse of the gifts which Balaa^ king of Moab
proffered him / notwithstanding yt god forbad it him and badde him not come
there / wherefore as he rode to the king Balaa^ / his ass yt he rode on
vndername him and hurt his foot against a wall. For the ass saw an angel
standing with a sword drawn against him in the way / and therefore the ass
fled out of yt way in to yt field Balaam was wroth and smote his ass full
hard with a staff / for he bare him so out of the way. And y^ ass came in a
strayt way between two walls / and there he saw also the angel against him /
and for dred he fled a side and bare Balaam against y^ wall and hurt his
foot against y^ wall. Than Balaam bette the ass full evil. Soon after y^
angel stood against him in so strayt a way / yt the ass might not flee on any
side / but fell down and would no ferther / than efte he smote the ass God
opened the asses mouth and he said to Balaam / what have I do against the / why
betest thou me now the third time. I have always be thy be / and thou haste
always roden on me / and I served the never thus till now. Than god opened the
eyes of Balaam and he saw y^ angel standing against him with a naked sword /
which repreued him of his false couetyse and of his wicked purpose / and for
that he beat his ass without gylte and said / that but the ass had gone out
of the way / he should else have slain him / for his way was against the
plesau^ce of god. Dives. What betokens this tale. Pauper Balaam is to say in
english a deuourer of the people and troubelour of the folk. Interpretat^
deuorans ppl'm et turbans gentem. And therefore Balaam betokens false couetyse
of this world which deuoureth y^ poor people and troubled every nacyon. For
nyghe all the debate in this world is for mine and thine. And therefore said a
philosopher. Toll duo verba meu^ et tuum. et totus mundus erit in pace. Put
out of this world two words mine and thine / and all the world shall be in
peace. Balaam first in his prophecye worshypped gods people and prophesied to
them much prosperyte as he was compelled by y^ might of god to say But at the
last with his shrewde counsel that he gave to Balaac to have his gifts / he
desceyued gods people and brought them to lecherye and to ydolatrye and so
to offend god / wherefore four and twenty thousand of gods people were
slain / and all the princes of the people were hanged upon gebettes against the
son at the bidding of god. Right so couetyse of this world first puts
men in hope of great prosperyte / and byheteth them wealth and worship. See
says couety s;e / such a clerk is there y^ may spend so much by year / and
yet he was but a poor man's sone as thou art / be of good heart / for such
as he is thou might be. And so couetyse puts example of knights / of
merchants / of prelates / of lords / and of ladies. If thou have richesse
says couety s;e / thou may do much alms and have many priests to pray
for the out of purgatory. But beware for by such byhestes the fend and
worldely couety s;e ben about to desceyue the and to bring the in glotonye and
lecherye and ydolatrye / as Balaam brought gods people to shenshyp. He would
make the to trust more in thy good than in thy god For what thing that man or
woman loves most and sets his heart most therein / that is his god / as
saint Ierom says. Therefore saint Poule says. That auaryce is seruage of
mawnetrye. For gold is god to y^ couetouse man to whom he does most worship /
which falls god is betokened by the image of gold y^ was.xl. cubytes in hight
and.vi. in bread which the king Nabugodono sor raised up in the field of
Durayn / and compelled all men to worship it And who so would not worship it /
he did put them in an oven full of fire in token y^ who so worshypeth not in
this world the false god of gold and of false couetyse / and gives no tale
of this world and will not obey to false couetyse to serve it with gyle
falsehede and periurye / but live in treuth and in charity / that man shall have
much woo in this world And therefore saint Poule says that they yt will live
mekely and goodly in christ shall suffer much trybulacyon in this world.
Therefore saint Gregory says This world is a forneys and an oven to try in
gods childern by anguysshe and try^ulacyon. Beware of the byhestes of
couetyse / for fair byhestes make sottes blythe. He will so entryke the in
debt and in sin / that it shall be full hard to the for to escape and so to

Dives. I wene that all men might be helped with her rich s;ses after her death
Pauper It is not so. But only they shall be helped with their good after their
death that deserve it by their life to be helped with their rychesses after there
death / as they that do alms after their astate / and spend well the goods
that god has sent to them / and pay well their dettes / and do such other
good deeds / and keep well them from dedely sin to their lives end or namely
than Thus says saint Austen in glosa prima ad thessalo. quarto super illud.
Nolumus vos ignorare de dormientibus. And therefore beware and take heed to three
warnynges and tokenes that god gave to Balaam to flee the sword. First his
ass went out of his way. After that he hurt his foot and dyseased all his
body. At the last he fell down under him and would no ferther bear him. By
the ass I understand wealth of this world that stands pryncypaly in
rychesses and in bodily health / which bears a man up in this world as the
ass bare Balaam But beware / for right as the ass is a full dulle be / and
when a man has most need and most haste in his Journey / than he will not go
but at his own lust and so desceyueth his master. Right so worldely wealth
desceyueth them that trust therein / and fails them at need. This ass of
worldely wealth first goth out of the way that is when god sends a man
aduersyte / and his causes and his travail goth not forth as he would ne as he
wend they should do / but when he we neth to win he leseth / and spedeth not
as he wend to speed. And there he weneth to find friends / he fyndeth
enemies. And in caas if he will pass the sea the wind is against him and
dryueth him out of his way. And if he plete / some slyght puts him out of
his purpose / and that he wend to speed in a month he shall not speed in a
year / and perauenture never bring his cause in to the right way there he
would have it. When this ass gothe out of the way / take heed to thy way and
to thy purpose / and if thy way and purpose be against the pleasau^ce of god /
as was the way of Balaam than wend again and cesse of thyn evil purpose. And
if it de not against the pleasaunce of god / dyspose the to pacyence and thank
god of al and take heed what the angel said to Balaam. But the ass said he /
ne had gone out of the way I had slain the. For but the welthe of the
world went some time out of the way by aduersyte and by sickness / else
it should be cause to much folk of death / both bodily and goostly For if
man had always his welthe and his will in this world / he should give no
tale of god / ne of man. The second token was that he hurt his foot and so
dyseased his body / that is when god sends man sickness and casts him
down in his bed / and makes him so feeble that his feet may not bear him /
than take thou head to thy way and to thy life / if it be ought contrary to
god / and if it be amendeth. The thrydde token was that y^ ass fell down
under his feet in a strayt way / and would not ferther bear him. This strayt
way and so narowe a paas is death where no man may flee. Than wealth of this
world lykened to the ass falls down to ground and will not longer bear
man upon this world. Than passes health and wealth and all lust of the
flesh. And therefore when thou come to the point / take heed to thy way and
to thy life. And if it be contrary to god amend y^ than for ever as thou wylt
flee gods sword. Rich s;se and welthe of this world is lykened to a
Iogulours horse. We find that on a time came a proud getter in to a stable
and found a mynstralles horse standing by his horse. And for it was better
than his / he took it and rode away thereon and left his feeble horse there.
The mynstrall perceived that / and ran by a nygh pathe and met with him in
passing over a water and cried. Flectamus genua. The horse knew well his
masters voice / as he was wont to do in play he did than / and kneled down
in the water. Than the mynstrall said Leuate. And anon the horse rose up as he
was taught and cast the proud getter in the water / and ran again to his
master. This mynstral is the world which plays with folk of this world
as a mynstrall as a Iogulour and as a dysour. His horse is rychesses of this
world / which often at the voice of this world plays. Flectamus genua. And
brings them low and to great pouerte and forsakes them in their most need
/ and follows the play of this world and not the will of couetouse folk that
would have them / but full often they that trauayl most to be rich ben most
poor / and namely evil gotten good soon plays. Flectamus genua with them
that have mysgoten them by myspurchace / or by withholdynge of debt / or by
false executorye / or by mycherye or robberye. Therefore it is a common proverb
De male quesitis vix gaudet tercius here is. Of evil gotten good uneath Ioyed the
third heir.

Dives. Thy speech is not plesaunt to worldely couetouse men / and yet
experyence shows that thou sayste sothe. Pauper It fares by many folk as it
does by many a sheep. For many sheep be not paid to go with their fellows in
common pasture / but seek there mete among busshes thorns and brymbles to have
the better bytte / tylle they ben so wicked and snarled among brymbles and
thorns that they may not go away. Than comes the pie or the rauene and
pyketh out the one eye / and afterward the other eye. Than comes the wolf or
an hounde or some other be and sleeth him Right so it is of couetouse folk.
For they will not live in plain pasture among their neighbors / ne be not
paid with common living that god has sent to them / but outrage and seek to
be in higher degree of rychesses and of worship than their neighbors ben / and
seek their living among brymbles and thorns / that is to say among false
rychesses / as says christ in y^ gospel. They borowe of one x.iv. of an
other.xx. lb. and so forth and think never to pay / and thus they get much
good and live a merry life with other men's good. Also they become executours
and attourneys to some rich man in his deynge / and behote him well to be true
to him. But when he is deed they keep all to the^self / and thus they snarle
themself so in debt and in false rychesses to be holden great in this world /
y^ they may not pay there dett. Than comes the fend and pyketh out there right
eye and makes them lose conscience anent god After he pyketh out their lift
eye / and makes them lose shame anentes the world. So y^ neither for dred of
god ne for shame or speech of the world / they cesse not to borewe ne to get
falsely other me^nes good / and so fall depper and depper in dett / till at y^
last the fend sleeth them body and soul. And therefore look yt you pay well
thy dettes while you may / for else you shall not when you would. For alsheep
that goth much among thorns leueth some of his flese in every busshe there
he goth till he is naked. Right so the thorns of false rychesses and such
dettes shall take thy flese fro the / y^ is to say / thy true catell if you any
have / so y^ thou shall have right naught to help thyselfe with / till when
you shall go naked of good and have less than naught. Therefore says a great
clerk Tullius li.ij. de officijs. That no thing saves more a comonte than
faith But faith may not be says he but men will pay their dettes. And in
the.iij. book de officijs he says / y^ it is sin against kind to take away
falsely a another man's good / and to make him rich with an other man's
loss. For that says he destroys charity and the felaushyp of mankind / for
men dare not comyne their good to gyder by lenynge for dread of falls couetyse
Dives. That is soth. For I had lever have my good in other men's hondes than
in mine / if I wyste that they would truly pay it again. But I find so many
false and so few true y^ I dare not lene but to full few. Say forth what thou
wylt.

PAuper. Two things pryncypaly should abate couetyse of man's heart.
Unstableness of this world and dread of death. First unstableness of this
world / for this world and the wealth of this world is lykened to four
things full unstable. To a whele about tournynge / to a ship in the sea
saylynge / to a flower that soon fades and falls to ground / and to a
shadow that away passes and dwells but a stounde. First wealth of this
world is lykened to a whele about tournynge / for when the whele goth about /
that yt is byneth / anon it is above / and that y^ is above / anon it is
byneth. And that y^ is on y^ one side / anon it is on the other side Right so
it is in the whele of fortune of this world. For now a man is byneth in his
youth and in his beginning In myddle age he is above in his wealth and in his
flowers. But anon the whele turned down again to greter age / to pouerte / to
sickness and feblenesse / till at the last he falls of the whele and dies
/ and lies there as a clotte of earth by the wall. Therefore in the whele of
fortune is written this verse. Regnabo regno regnaui.su^ sine regno. Man in his
youth when he is toward in hope of wealth / he says Regnabo. I shall reygne.
But when he is in his myddel age and has the world at will / and so sytteth
about on the whele / than he says in his pride Regno. Now I reygne. I am all
above. But anon the whele tourneth downewarde / anon comes age / sickness /
feblenesse / loss of catell / and aduersyte / than he may say. Regnaui. I
have reigned / sometime I was a man. But when he lies on deynge he may say.
Sum sine regno. I am without kingdom. My reygne my kingdom / my wealth is
done. Also in the whele of fortune / y^ is in the one side / anon it is in the
other side For they that been this day a man's friends and stand on his side
to help him / the next day they shall be his enemies and stand against him with
his aduersarye. Of this whele speaks Dauyd. In circuitu impij ambulant Wicked
couetouse folk go about as a whele. Posuisti eos vt rota^. et sicut stipula^
ante facie^ venti. Lord says he thou haste put them as a whele and a stoble
before the face of the wind. For as the stoble while the wind blows
wauereth and flees above in the air / now high / now low / but anon as the
wind passes it falls adowne to the earth and lies there stylle Right so the
proud couetouse folk wauere in this world in wealth and worship / now
higher / now lower. And as the stoble and the straw in his flight keeps no
certain way / so keep they no way of gods law / till at the last the
wind passes out of their body and they fall down in to there grave / and
many of them in to the pytte of hell. Also this world is lykened to a ship in
the sea saylynge. For be the ship ever so great of him self and have the wind
with him all at will / and bear he his sail never so high / and go he never
so yerne / be he passed there is no token where he went Right so be a man never
so great in this world / and have the wind of me^nes mouth never so well with
him to bear his name / to praise him and to flater him / though his name
spring never so wide and bear him never so high in pride / or be he so
solemn and so mighty / y^ no man dare quycche against him ne do / be he deed
and passed out of this world / soon he is foryeten. Men shall find no token
of him within a few years. Uneaths shall he find one friend that will do
sing a mass for his soul. Goo to the chircheyerde and you shall know by the
bodies the rich from the poor / the fair from the foul / the wise from the
foles / the free fro the bound. But all they torn there to earth and ashes /
to worms mete to stenche and uncleanness. All these great kings y^ were
sometime so great of name where ben they all bycomen. Alexander. Julius caesar.
Nabugodono sor. Octauyan. Arthur. king Charles and all such other / where ben
they bycomen. Therefore they may say y^ is written in the book of wysdom. Quid
nobis profuit superbia and^. What profyted to us our great pride / what halpe
us our pomp and our great rychesses. All is passed away as a shadow / and as
a ship yt passes the wawes of the sea / of which be it passed men may find
no token. Sap. v. Man's life may well be lykened to a ship which is streyt and
narowe at both ends / but in the mids it is wide and large. Right so is
man's life / for his birth and his beginning is full strayt and full narowe.
For he comes into this world naked and poor / weeping and walynge / vnmyghty
/ vnwytty / and naught may ne can help himself / and with much travail is
brought forth / till by little and little he comes to man's age. There the
ship of his life is somdele wide and large / for in his myddell age he has
most his might / his wit and his will But anon the ship of this life draws
to an other strayt end. Anon comes age / feblenesse / seknesse / aduersyte /
loss of catell / and pouerte / and at the last death makes a full strayt end
/ when he dies with bitter pain in much dread and much sorrow and gooth hens
naked and poor right as he came and bears naught with him but his good deeds and
wicked. Of these two strayt ends says Job thus. Nudus eg^essus snm de vtero
matris me. et nudus reuertar illuc. Naked I came out of my moders womb / and
naked I shall turn again in to the earth mother of all. And if a man will styre
well a ship or a boat / he may not stand in y^ mids of the ship / ne in the
former end but he must stand in y^ last end / and there he may styre the
ship as he will Right so he y^ will styre well y^ ship of his life in this world
/ he may not stand in y^ mids of his ship not set his thought and his heart
in wealth that he has in his myddel age / ne he shall not stand in y^ former
end not set his heart ne his thought in his birth ne in his beginning to
think much of his kynrede / ne of alyau^ce to styre him to pride. But he must
stand in ye last end of his ship and of his life and think on his death /
and on his last end. And how myscheuously and how perylously he shall wend
hens / and how wheder ne when wot he never. And in that manner he shall best
styre the ship of his life to the syker haven of heaven bliss. Therefore the
wise man says. Memorare nouissimatua et in eternu^ non peccabis. Think
Inwardly of thy last things and of thine end / and thou shall never do
sin. Eccl.vij. In the beginning of every deed think on the end what end
it may have and what may fall thereof.

ALso welthe of this world is lykned to a flower that soon fades and falls
to the ground. For as the roso flower is fair to the sight / swear in
smelling / soft in handelynge / so wealth of this world is fair to the sight
of man and liking in the having. But right as the rose wexeth always among
the chornes / and he that gadreth roses but he be more ware shall lightly hurt
him and prycke him. Right so wealth and rychesses of this world wexeth all
among thorns of hard travail of thonght of b^ysynesse and of many peryls /
both bodily and goostely. For a man has much travail in the getynge / much
dread in the keeping / much bitter sorrow in the lesynge. Dives diuicias no^
^gregat absque labor. Non tenet absque metu nee deserit absque dolor. When a
man has trauayled all his life time to gadre good / and to have wealth and
worship in this world / it will soon welke tade and fall away as the rose
Suddenly comes moreyn and his beestes dye / comes aduersyte and loss of
catel / and at last death takes away every dele And who so will be besy to
gadre the rose of worldely weth and of rychesses / but he be right ware he
shall hurt him both bodily and goostly. And therefore saint Poule says that
they that coueyte to be rich in this world / they fall in the fendes snare
and in to full hard temptacyons. For these causes saint James says y^ the
rich man shall pass away as y^ flower of the grass and of the heye. For
when the son shyneth hot on the heye it welketh and dries and his flower
fades / and his beauty passes. Right so says he the rich man welketh and
fades in his ways / y^ is to say in his living Iacobi.i. Also worldely
wealth is lykened to y^ shadow always passing For all our living in this
world is but a passing and a wantynge of light of heaven bliss. In the mids
of the day when the son is highest / than is y^ shadow shortest. Right so
when a man weneth to be but in the mids of his life / and is highest in
welthe and in his pride / than is his life shortest for than men dye sooneste in
their most prosperyte. And y^ nygher even and the end of the day the longer
is a man's shadewe. Right so these worldely couetouse men the longer yt they
live and when they ben at their lives end / than they think most to live
longer. Than they purchase / than they house / than they begin to plete till
their life pass suddenly away as a shadewe at even Therefore man's life is
lykened to a slyder way. For when a mar^goth by a slyder way / the more that
he galeth about and the ferther that he looks fro him the sooner and the
harder shall he fall. Bnt if he look well to his feet and to his way / he may
keep him on left and though he fall he shall take no great harm. Right so it
fares by the life of this world. It is so slyder yt there might never man ne
woman pass by this wayt / but at the last he slydeth in to sickness and
myscheef and fell down and dyed / or else shall come to y^ same end. And
commonly when men look ferthest fro them self and think to live lengest / and
begin most to house and to purchase / and purpo s;e many shrewde tournes /
and to live most in wealth and in delyces / than they dye soonest and pass
away sodaynely as a shadow at even. Example Christ tells in the gospel
Luce.xij. There was says christ some time a rich man and had in a year a
plenteuous crop on his land / in so much that he had not houses enough to
lay it in. He thanked not god of his gift / but turned him to proud couetou
s;e thoughts / and said to himself / what shall I do I have no housynge to
lay in my corn and my good. I shall destroy mine old bernes and garnerys and
make new longer and larger / and stuff them full of good / and than shall I
say to my soul. Now soul thou haste good enough for many years / now take
thy rest / now ete and drink and make feste. So he thought all of his life in
this world / and naught of the life in the other world. Anon god said to
him. Fool this night fendes shall take thy soul from the / to whom shall than
be all the goods that thou haste arrayed and gadred to gydre. He might say
that they should be theyrs that trauayled not therefore.

THe clerks that treat of kind say yt the fox in winter when he gooth to
seek his pray / if he come to a frollen water / he lies his ere down to the
ice / and if he here any water rennynge underneath / he will not pass over there
/ for the ice is not syker / but he syketh him an other syker way. Thus I
would y^ all synful couetouse men did when they go about to syke their pray of
falls couety s;e / of false purchase / or to rob and begyle any man of his
good. Than I would they laid their ^eres to the ice and thought how freyle a
man's life is. For as the ice comes of y^ water and tourneth again to y^
water. Right so all we came of the earth / and shall turn again to the earth /
and if they would thus lay their ^ere to this ice they should here water
re^nyng. They should here say / there dies a pope / there a king / there a
prince / there a duke there dies a bishop / there a knight there a squire.
They should here that as soon dies the rich as the poor / the great as the
small / the young as the old. Therefore holy writ says. Omnes morimur. et
in terram quali aqua dilabimur. All we dye and slide in to the earth as
water.ij. Regu^ xiiij. Therefore saint Bernarde in his medytacyon repreueth the
proud covetous folk of this world and says thus. Vbi sunt amatores seculi.
qui nobiscu^ ante pauca tempora fueru^t. Tell me now says he / where ben now
these lords and leders / these proud gettours / and these false couetouse men
that were here with us within a few years where be they now bycome. There is no
thing of them left but ashes powder and worms. Take heed what they were and
what they ben They were men as you art / ete and drank as you do / and led
their days in much myrthe / and in a twynkelynge of an eye many of them sanke
down in to the pytte of hell / where their flesh is given unto worms / and
where their soul is put in to endeles pain / what help them their vain
glory / there po^pe / their pride / their mirth / their game and glee. Where is
now their game and their laughing / their boost and their high berynge / all
is paste as a shadow. From great mirth they ben fallen in to endelesse sorrow
/ from lust and liking in to bitter pain / from plente in to endelesse
myscheef. Dives. These words styreme and so the may many other little to set
by wealth and worship of this world. But well is he yt may have help of his
good after his death / and than find friends and true attorneys. Pauper But
much better it is that he has grace to help himself before his death with
his own good / for one penny shall profit more before his death than.xx. penys
after / and more profyteth one candell before a man than.xx. behynd hy^ Therefore
saint Lucye taught her mother to do alms by her life / and not abide till
after her death / and said to her mother. Here ye my counsel. It is no gift
full plesau^t to god when man or woman gives thing y^ he may not use himself
/ therefore if ye will yt god be plesed with your gift / give ye to hy^ thing y^
ye may use your self. For y^ ye give in your dyenge therefore ye give it / for
ye may not bear it with you And therefore mother while ye live and have health of
your body give to god that ye have.

When a man will not do for hy^self while he may / though his executours and
his attorneys do naught for him it is no great wou^dre. For each man and woman
is most holden to himself. But it fares often by hem that dyed and by their
executours / as it did ones by two fools y^ dwelled in a lords court. The
one was a fool sage / that other was a naturell fool. It byfell on a day
they came to gydre in to a kabehouse when folk were at the oven / and the oven
was glowynge hot. Than said the fool sage to the natural fool whether the
oven be now hot as it seems / will we assaye said the other ye said the fool
sage / but which of us shall go in to the oven first for to assaye. Than said
the naturell fool I shall goo in / and thou shalt have a bolle full of water
and stand at the ouens mouth. And if I feel hete and I cry cast cast /
anon cast the water after me and quench the fire about me. It shall be done
said the other fool. Than the naturell fool took the fool sage a bolle full
of water in his hand / and he went and crepte in to the oven / and anon as
he was in he began to brenne. And anon he cried cast cast. When the other
fool saw his folly he laughed so enterely at his folly that uneaths he might
stand on his fete. Than the fool in the oven cried cast man cast I brenne
to death. Than the other fool answered / bre^ne you if brenne wylt / dye if thou
dye wylt. I laugh so that I may not cast. And so the fool brent to death in ye
oven. By tho two fools I vnderstaude men y^ dye and their false executours /
for both ben they fools. For the executours ben great fools in that / that
they bind them to hell pain for their falsehede. But they that dye ben more
fools in that that they trust more to other men than to themself. For when
they shall crepe in to purgatory / that is hoter than any oven / than they
take to their executours a bolle full of water in their hand / that is to say
gold and silver and other rychesses for to do alms for them / and by
almesdede / by masses singing / and holy prayers refresshe them in their
pains / and kele the fire about them. But commonly when they have this bolle
of water in their hand / and have the goods at their will / they laugh so and
make so merry and fare so well with the goods of the deed / that they may no
thing cast after them / for they be full loath to forgo any of the goods. And
therwhyles y^ sinful soul lies in purgatory and suffers full much woe and
cries after help night and day saying in this manner. Miseremini mei
miseremini mei. salte^ vos amici mei. qr manus dni^ tetigit me. Job.xix. Have
ye mercy on me have ye mercy on me namely ye my friends / for y^ hand of god
full hard has touched me. And when they find no help of them y^ should
help them they axe vengeance on them night and day. A great clerk Turpinus
de gest^ Karoli tells yt the king Charles had with him a knight in his oost a
man of good conscience and when he should dye he called to hy^ his neuewe
praynge him yt when he were deed he should selle his horse and his harneys and
do alms / and do sing thrytty masses for his love. He behyght him well but
lasted him full evil / and kept it stylle to his own use and did not as he
badde him do. When the thrytty days were passed in y^ night following / the
knight apperyd in sleep to his neuewe / and axed him why he had not done as he
bad him do. Than he excused him by dyuer s;e besynesses y^ he feigned not that
had. And he axed his eme how he fared. And than he answered and said I shall
tell the how I fare / and how thou shall fare. All these thrytty days I have been in purgatory and suffered full much woo and pain for defaute of help. But
now thank be god I am passed purgatory and goo up to heuens bliss without
end. But for thou would not help me as I badde the / therefore as this day
mydmorowe thou shall dye and goo to hell without end. On the next day
following as he rode in y^ oost on y^ same horse and told these dremes to his
fellows as for a Iape / at mydmorowe came suddenly a blake sky with thondre
and lyghtnynge and great nombre of fendes in likeness of ravens and rokes and
hent him up fro the horse in the mids of the oost and flewe away with him /
so that they saw no more of him till they came four days Journey thens
among the mou^tes of Nauerne. There they found him all to rent and drawn
lyth from lyth / but his soul was drawn to hell. By his cote armure they
knew well that it was y^ same man Dives. Be a man deed he fyndeth few friends.

PAuper. I read in vita Barla am y^ there was a rich man which had iij.
friends. The first friend and the second he loved with all his heart / but
the third friend he loved little or naught. This man fell in such a danger
against his king yt a^ his good was forfetted and eschetyd to ye king and
himself wened to have been slain. Than he went to his first friend yt he
loved so much praynge him of help / and yt he would go to the king and speak
for hy^ and save his life if he might. Than he answered and said. Fare well faue
I know the not. I have other fellows and friends enough with whom I have my
myrtes and solace. Nathelesse if thou be slain I shall give the a shete to
burye the in. Than he went to the second friend that he loved so much
praynge him also of help. And he excused him and said. I pray the have me
excused / for I am so besye that I may not atende to the But yet for old
felaushyp I shall go with the on way to the yate. Than went he to the third
friend that he loved so little and prayed him of help and said Leave friend I am
ashamed to speak to the for I have been to the full unkind and little love
showed to the. But I pray the have reuth on me / and for gods sake help me
in this need. And than he answered him and said. Leave friend welcome be thou /
and be of good comfort / for I am thy friend and will be thy friend / and to
help the that I may do / thou shall find me ready. And anon he went and did
so and spoke to the king that he saved (...) life / and delivered him out of
all his danger. Dives. So it fares these days / as long as a man is in
wealth so long he shall have friends enough to take of him what they may and to
flater him and to please him. But if he begin to go donewarde / than fyndeth
he few friends and many enemies. Therefore says the wise man. Tempore felici
multi numerantur amici. Cum fortuna perit nullus amicus erit. In time of wealth
a man shall find friends enough. But when rychesses and hap is gone / he shall
find few friends and feel fone. Say forth thy tale. Pauper By this rich man
I understand every man yt has rychesses and goods of this world. By his
first friend y^ he loved so much which gaaf him but a shete to be buried in
I understand the world / which worldely men love so much / y^ for love
thereof they travail night and day and put them in peril of body and soul /
and often lose them self both body and soul. And yet at ye last end uneaths
gives it to them a shete to be buried in. For many of them when they dye have
less than naught. And if they have ought / yet their executours will say y^
they have naught / and yt they owe more than they have. By the second friend
that went with him to the yate I understand a man's wife / his childern and
his bodily friends. And a womannes husbonde / her childern / and her bodily
friends / which when they ben deed / shall go with them on way to the yate
and bring them to their grave / and per adventure stand and weep on them. But
be man or woman deed and doluen under claye / he is soon forgeten and out of
mind passed away. Be the belles ronge and the masses song he is soon
forgeten. Uneaths shall he find one friend that will sing for him one mass
uneaths in the year. By the thrydde friend which he loved so little and
which halpe him at his need I understand almesdede which the worldely
couetouse men love full little. And yet at the dredeful dome when they shall
stand at the bar before the sovereign Judge Christ Ihesn / than alms deed
shall be the best friend that they shall have. For that shall speak for them
and pray for them and save them if they shall be saved. And therefore Solomon
says. Conclude elemosmam in sinu pauperis. et ipsa pro te exorabit ab omni
malo. Ecclesiastici.xxix. Therefore leave friend do ye as Tobye taught his sone.
Ex substancia tua fac elemosinam. Do alms of thy good and of thy catell /
and nyll thou turn away thy face from any poor man / and as you might be
thou mercyable. If thou have much give thou much. But and if thou have but
little study thou to give little with good will. For than thou tresourest to
the a great gift in the day of need. For alms delivered souls from every
sin and from death / and suffered not the soul to go in to derkenesse.

Dives. To whom shall I do mine alms. Pauper Do as Christ byddeth in the
gospel. Omni petenti te tribue. Give to every nedy that axeth the if you might.
Luce.vi. Dives. Contra. Christ in y^ gospel Luce.xiiij. says thus. When you
make a feast nyll you call thereto thy friends thy neighbors / thy cosyns and
rich men / but call you poor men / feeble / blind and halt / by which words
it seems to me y^ I should do none alms but to poor y^ ben feeble blind
and lame Pauper. Christ fordydeth not men to bid there friends and there
neighbors and rich men to ye feast. But he bad he^ y^ they should not only
bid their friends and y^ rich / but also poor folk nedy and teble. Also he
bad yt men should not bid ye rich folk and their friends to feast with no
wicked emenco^n in hope of false winning / for pomp / for glotonye / for
lecherye / or to get them a great worldely name / but pryncypaly for to
nourysshe peace and charity / and in token yt feast is made with good entenco^n
both to rich and poor ben plesau^t to god / christ called us al rich and
poor to y^ endelesse feast. And christ himself though he were poor in our
manhede / he was not feeble blind ne halt when y^ pharise to whom he said tho
words bad him to mete / ne when he was at the brydales with his mod in the
chane of galyle / ne when Mary magdaleyn and her sister Martha and Zacheus made
him great festes and yet they were praised of christ for there deeds / and all
that fed christ and his apostles and his dyscyples when they went about the
world prechynge and techynge ben praised. And yet the apostles and his
dyscyples were strong men / neither blind ne lame. And christ himself fed
his dyscyples neither blind ne lame. And sometime he ^ed four thousand of men
/ sometime five thousand that followed him fro contre to contre to here his
prechyng and to see wou^dres that he did / and yet were they not blind ne
lam^. For as the gospel says he made them hole of their bodily seknesse or yt
he fed them Luce.ix. et Math.xiiij. Also tho two dyscyples yt took christ to
herborowe in ye likeness of a pilgrim on ^ester day at even ben praised and
yet was he never blind ne lame. Also Abraham and Loath and many other holy men
resceyued angels in the likeness of worshypfull men neither blind ne lame to
mete and herborowe. And saint Peter resceyued knights and worshypfull men to
mete and to herborowe which came to him on message from ye great lord Cornely
/ as we read in holy wrytt. Actuu^.x. And all these ben praised of god / and
had much thank of god for their almesdede. Therefore I said first. Christ bad
that men should do alms to all that need both friend and foo. And the apostle
byddeth / if thine enemy have hongre feed him / if he have thirst give him
drink. The charity of christian faith outaketh no person man ne woman ne state
ne degree / ne sect hethen ne christian from almesdede wha^ they had need / but
we must have pity on all and help all at our power. Nathelesse we must keep
order in gyuynge and taking head to the cause and to the manner of need in
them that we give alms to. For why some be poor by their will and some
against their will. And they that been poor by their will some ben poor for the
love of god / and some for the love of the world. They that been poor for the
love of god must be helped passing other / for their pouerte is medefull /
parfyght and virtuous. They that been poor wylfully not for god / but for ye
world / as the Romans were / and as these days much folk dysmytte them of
their own good and take it to there childeren to make them great in this world
/ and much folk take so much head to other men's proufyte / that they take
none head to them self / and so fall in pouerte and in need / such poor
folk must pryncypaly be helped of them to whom their goods profyted / and
rather help them than other y^ ben poor against their will / but they shall
not be put before them that be poor for the love of god but the need be the
more.

Caplm.xiiij.
OF them that been poor against their will / some ben poor by fortune / by
mysauentures / as they to whom fortune serves not at their will / ne god
multeplyeth not their good as they would / and that that they have they lose by
mysauentures / and by the dome of god. And some ben poor only for sin and
for the love of sin / as they that waste their good in lecherye and glotonye
/ in pride and pletynge and in mysuse at the dyce / in riot and in vanyte.
Such poor folk ben last in the order of alms doing / but their need be
the more. And nathelesse if they have pacyence with their pouerte they shall
have mede for their pacyence if they repent them for their misdeeds And in y^
same manner some ben feeble / blind and lame for gods cause and for gods
love. Some against their will by course of kind. Some against their will for love
of sin / as thieves / fyghters / baratours / which in fight and barett lose
their eyes / their feet / their ho^des / and often ben punysshed by the law God
forbede y^ such poor folk blind and lame should be put in y^ order of alms
doing before them y^ be poor and feeble by virtue and for gods sake Such
shall be helped not to lust of their flesh ne to do them worship / but only to
save their kind tylle the dome of god pass upon them by process of law and
by gods mynystres Dives Much folk think y^ it is none alms to do good
to such folk. proauper Yes forsooth. For god will y^ men help them / and at
the dome he shall say. I was in prison and ye vysyted me and y^ ye did to the least of mine ye did it to me. Dives. Saint Austen de ^bis dni^ sermon.xxxv.
says / y^ god shall say y^ words to them y^ be poor in spyryte and low of
heart / and y^ such ben called the brethern of christ and lest for lowness
by which they set lest by themself. Pauper They ben no folk poor in
spyryt / but they y^ be poor for gods sake. And saint Austen shows there
so y^ god shall accept more the alms that is done to them that been poor for
gods sake than to them y^ ben poor against their will and for sin sake /
which conclusyon al though it be soth / yet me thinks yt christ shall say
tho words for the alms yt he has done to all manner poor men both
parfyght and vnparfyght. For than he shall yield mede for every good deed. For
why wicked doers and synful poor men ben called the least of gods menye /
for they be lest set by in the court of heaven. And therefore he says in the
gospel that who so breketh one of his lest co^mau deme^tes and techeth other
by word or by evil example so to break his commandments he shall be called
lest in the kingdom of heaven. God shall show at the dome great pity and much
mercy / what thing yt is done for his sake to his enemies and to his lest
servants most unworthy / he shall accept it and reward it as it were done to
his own person and say I thank you for that ye did to the least of mine /
ye did it to me. Dives. Why shall he call them brethern y^ be lest worthy /
and many of them to whom the alms was done shall be dampened. Pauper Er he
shall give the sentence of dampnaco^n he shall call al men brethern for
likeness of kind. For in y^ he is man he is brother to us all by likeness of
kind / but not by grace ne by bliss / but only to them y^ ben in grace. Than
the meke Judge shall call al men brethern to confort of them that shall be
saved / and to great dysconfort to them y^ shall be dampened / when they shall
see the meke Judge not forgete the brotherhede ne likeness in kind which he
has with them / and yet catched and in manner compelled by his ryghtfulnesse to
dampne them. Great matter shall they have than to syghe and sorrow when they
shall know their sins so grievous and so great / and their unkindness so
much / that there own brother so meke a Judge must dampne them. Dives This
opinion is more pleasant to rich men and to other sinful wretches y^ hope
than to be helped by almesdede. For in many countrees ben but few poor folk
in spyryte / ne by their will. Few y^ forsaken the world for gods sake /
but many there be that the world has forsaken / many y^ for sin sake ben
full poor / and many for their misdeeds lie bound in prison in great pouerte
/ hongre / cold and bitter pains. And to such folk in many contrees men do
most commonly their alms in hope to be thanked and rewarded therefore at the
last dome. Pauper They shall be thanked and be meded therefore as I said first
/ and sythen christ ryghtful Judge shall than thank men for their alms y^
they did for his love to his enemies and wicked doers as many such ben / much
more he shall thank them for their alms yt they did to his friends and to
his true seruau^t^. And sythen they shall be dampened that would not give to his
enemies at need for his sake / much sooner shall they be dampened ye would not
help his friends and his true servants at need for his sake / that put
themself for his love to pouerte and much travail for help of man's soul.
And if it be so plesau^t and medefull to give alms to such poor folk
forsakynge the world / of which many neither shall be resceyued in to
endless tabnacles of bliss / neither shall resceyue in to that bliss much
more it is plesau^t to god and me rytorye to help them yt ben poor in spyryte
and in will for the love of god. For as christ says in the gospel / the
kingdom of heaven is theyrs / and it is granted to them to resceyue folk that
have helped them in to endelesse tabernacles.

ANd therefore leave friend wytt ye it well yt if man or woman have more will to
give to the^ that been poor against their will and for the love of sin / than
for to give to them yt ben poor for gods sake and for gods cause / they
sin grievously and lose the mede of their alms in that they put gods
enemies before his friends / and vice before virtue. And therefore ye shall
releue all the poor and nedy as ye may / but pryncypally them y^ ben nedy and
poor for gods sake and by way of virtue. For if ye leave by false opinion
the more alms for the less / when ye may do both in good manner / ye lose
both mede for the more and for the less. Therefore saint Austen says thus.
Thou shall not do to y^ poor prechour of gods word as you do to the beggar
passing by the way. To the beggar you gyuest / for christ byddeth the that you
give to each that axeth the. But to the poor prechour you ought to give
though he axe the not. And therefore look that the poor prechour gods knight
need not to axe the. For if he need to axe for thy defaute / and thy defaute
and thy lacchesse / he shows the dampnable or he axe. And right as it is said
of the beggar that seeks the / give you every man that axeth the / so it is
said of him y^ you ought to seek. Let thine alms sweet in thine hand
tylle y^ find him to whom you must give. Give you to every man y^ axeth the /
but much rather and more give to gods seruau^t^ / to y^ knight of christ
though he axe not. Hec augustinus. et ponit in glosa super illud p^i. Producens
fenu^ iumentis And therefore says the law that who so will not give alms to
men yt follow the life of the apostles in pouerte and to the poor prechoures
for their needful use / he dampneth himself.xvi. q^.i. aplicis. For as the
apostle says / it is due debt to y^ poor prechour of gods word to live by
his prechynge. Therefore Raymu^dde hospitalitate ordinand. says / that some axe
alms of debt / some only for need to sustain the body. They that axe
alms of debt either they be known for such / or not known for such. If
they be known for such they must needs be helped. If they be not known /
they shall be examyned wisely whether it be as they say. For it were great
peril to let them if it be so. For in that they give goostely things /
bodily things be due dett to them / as saint Poul says and the law.xlij.
did. quiescamus. And if they axe only for sustenaunce of the body / either you
might give all for stead and time / either you might not give all. If you may
give all you owe to give all after the need that they pretend and after their
astate well ruled Take exsample of Abraham and Loath which resceyued folk
Indyfferently to hospytalyte / and so they resceyued angels. And if they had
put some away / peradventure they should have put away angeles for men. As
says Crysostom super eplam ad Hebre. Therefore he says that god shall not yield
the thy mede for the good life of them which you resceyuest / but for thy good
will / and for the worship y^ you do to them for gods sake / for thy mercy
and thy goodness. And therefore the law says / yt men ought to give their
alms to cursed folk and to sinful folk be they never so wicked.xi.

ANd in case when you mygh not help all / thou must take heed to ten things.
To faith / cause / place / time / manner / need / nyghenesse of blood and of
affynyte / age / feblenesse / nobley. Fyr etc take heed to faith / for in caas
thou shall put a christian man before an hethen man Also take heed to the cause
of his need / whether he is come to need for gods cause / or by cause of
sin. Take heed also to y^ place / as when y^ right full man is tourmented in
prison for debt and help him if thou may. For sythen we be bound to help
all if we may / much more we be bounden to help the ryghtfull man and woman.
Also take heed to the time / for if he get no thing of the in time of his
trybulacyon and in time of peril when he is led to his death vnryghtfully / but
you set more by thy money than thou do by his life / it is no light
sin Also take heed to the manner of gyuynge / that you give so one day that
thou may give an other day / and so to one that you may give to an other / but
thou wylt forsake the world all at ones for gods sake and for perfecco^n.
Also take heed to need and give them after that they have need. Also take heed
to nyghenesse of blood and of affynyte / for by way of kind they must be
helped rather than strangers if the need of both be even. Also take heed to
age / for old folk must be put before young folk. Also take heed to the
feblenesse / for blind and lame and other feeble folk must be helped rather
than hole folk in even need. Also take heed to ye nobley of the person /
namely to them yt with out sin ben fallen to pouerte and myscheef / for commonly
such ben shamefaste to axe did.lxxxvi. Non latis. Et eadem dicit Ambro.li. de

Dives. I suppose yt I met with two poor men strangers alyke nedy both they
axe / and I have naught y^ I may give but only to the one of them. Pauper.
Saint Austen in the same place byddeth y^ you sholdest than give it by lot.
Dives I assent / say forth what thou wylt. Pauper Also in thy gyuynge you must
take heed to the holiness and to the profytablenesse and the nyghenes of the
person y^ needs help. For to the holyer man and to him y^ is or has been
more profitable to the comonte if he need thou shall give rather and better
than to a person nyghe of kynne or of affynyte not so holy ne so profitable /
but you have the more special cure of him / and but he be in the greter need
Also to them y^ be poor for crystus sake and to the poor prechours yt preche
pryncypally for the worship of god and help of man's soul / putting away
all spyces of false couetyse / you shall give them that is needful to them
after y^ time and after thy power as to dyscyples of christ. But to other poor
folk y^ ben poor against their will which the world has forsaken / not they
the world / it suffyseth to give of thy relyf honest and wholesome / for it is
sin to give deyntees to such poor common beggars when they ben not
conuenyent to them. As the law says di.xxv. vuu^. S. multi et di.xli. Non
cogant. Of other poor men speaks saint Austen in a sermon of clerks life
and says thus. If the rich man have but one child / we ne he y^ christ be
his other child / if he have two childern / wene he that christ be y^ third.
If he have ten make christ the enleuenth / that is to say / give he to christ
y^ he should spend on the enleuenth.xiiij. q^.ij. si ^s trascit. And thus leave
friend ye may see that rich men which be gods reues and gods bayles owe
to ordeyne for them that been poor for gods love and wylfully have forsaken
the world for his sake that they have no need. But to common beggars and to
nedy folk which the world has forsaken / it suffyseth so to help them and
to give them y^ they perysshe not. Also leave friend as saint Austen says in
the book of the Cite of god li.xxi. ca.xxvi. They that will not amend there life
/ ne forsake their great sins done no plesau^t alms For why says he /
alms should be done to get forgyuenesse of sins yt be paste / not to
get leave to dwell stylle in sin and to do a mys.

Here ends the nynthe commandment And begins the tenthe.
Capitulum Primu^.
Dives. Me thinks thy speech reasonable good and proufitable / and well
confermed by great auctoryte. I thank the for thy words and thy good
enfo^^aeyon in the nynthe commandment. Now I pray the enfourme me in the
tenthe commandment. Pauper The tenthe commandment is this. Non de^^derabis
vxorem proximi tui. no^ seruu^. no^ ancillam. no^ boue^. no^ asinu^. nec o^nia
que illius sunt. Exodi.xx. Thou shall not desire thy neighbors wife / not his
servant / not his maiden / not his ox / not his ass / ne no thing that to
him longs. In the nynthe commandment god forbydeth couetyse of an other
man's good not mouable. In this last he forbydeth all manner false couetyse of
an other man's good mouable. Also in the nynthe commandment he forbydeth
couetyse of ye eye In this last pryncypall he forbydeth couetyse of the
flesh. And therefore says saint Austen that the.x. commandment is this
allone / you shall not desire thy neighbors wife. And all y^ follows after
when he says / not his sernau^t / not his ox ne his ass / ne no thing y^ to
him longs / it is of the.ix. commandment. And it is also a new forbedynge
of all manner mys couetyse / both of thing mouable and not mouable / both of
couetyse of the eye and of the flesh. And therefore if a man dyscoueyte an
other man's seruau t / or his wife / or his child / as for possessyon and
service / it is against the nynthe commandment / and pryncypally against
couetyse of the eye. And if he coueyte them for mysluste of the flesh / than
it is against the tenthe commandment. Dives. I hope that not every myscouetyse
is dedely sin against gods commandment. For couetyse both of the eye and
of the flesh falls lightly in man's heart. And it is not in our power
always to flee thought of falls couetyse. For as sayt Poule says / the flesh
coueyteth always against y^ spirit. Pauper God forbydeth not such couetyse y^
is not in our power to flee / but he forbydeth all manner myscouetyse with
assent to perform it and long liking therein And therefore though men do not
in deed their falls coretyse / if they be in will to do it in deed if they might
or durst for dread of the world / than they sin dedely against gods
byheste. Dives. Sith it is so y^ falls couety s;e with assent and will to
perform / it is dedely sin and against gods commandment. And as saint
Poule says / it is rote and beginning of every evil. Radix oi^m malorum est
cupiditas Sythen wicked will gooth before wicked deed / why puts not god y^
forbedynge of false couetyse and of wicked will in y^ order of the.x.
commandments before the forbedynge of the deed of lechery and of theft /
sith couetyse and evil will is beginning of both For wicked will gooth before
every sin / in so much y^ ne were not wicked will there should no sin be.
Pauper God gave the tenthe commandment to the people as sovereign techer and
as sovereign leche. And every techynge must begin at things that been most
easy to know / and every cure and leche craft both of body and of soul
must begin there the sickness is felt moost-greuous. And for as much as
the unwise people has more knowing that mysde de was sin than myswylle /
and felt them more aggreued by mysdede tha^ myswylle / therefore god forbedeth
first the deed of false couetyse / and after he forbedeth the will and the
assent to myscouetyse. Dives. Yet contra te. God forbedeth no thing but sin
and sin of deed and of will is all one. For sin begins at evil will and
ends in evil deed. As we read in the second book of kings / of king Dauyd.
First he desired the fair woman Bersabee that was wife to the true knight
Vrye / and fro that wicked desire he fell in to auoutrye and from auoutrye in
to glotonye / and from glotonye in to false traytorye / and from traytorye in
to murdre and manslaughter and blasphemye / and to despysynge of godded high
mageste / wherefore god punysshed him full hard / for the child so mys gotten
dyed soon after the birth. And his sone Absolon lay openly by his wives in
sight of the people and drove him out of his kingdom. His other sone Amon lay
by his own sister Thamar. And therefore Absolon her brother and his slew him.
Bnd Solomon his sone slew his brother Adony / and so Dauyd had little Joy of
his childern because of his auoutrye And was there never after stabylyte in his
kingdom for yt auoutrye and murder and other sins yt came al of his wicked
desire and evil will / for yt he so mysdesyred an other man's wife against yt
byhest of god when he says. Non desiderabis vxore^ proximi tui Thou shall not
desire thy neighbors wife. Pauper When wicked deed is knyt to wicked will it
is one sin / and both ben forboden by the same commandment in which he
forbedeth lecherye and theft. But when the will and the assent be not done in
deed / than the sin stands only in evil will / and such sin pryncypaly is
forboden by these two last commandments / in which god shows openly that
evil will without the deed is dedely sin.

Caplm.ij.
Dives. When god gave the co^mau dementes in the mou^te of Synay to Moses.
There he forbade first couetyse of the eye. But when Moses rehearsed again the
law to the childern of Israel when they should enter in to y^ land of
byheste there Moses forbad first couety s;e of flesh and puts it before
/ as we read Deut^.v. what was cause of this dyuersyte. Pauper. When god gaf
them y^ law in the mount of Synay they were in desert in great myscheef / and
therefore they were more enclyned to robberye than to lecherye. And therefore god
for yt time forbydeth the^ first couetyse of y^ eye and than couetyse of y^
flesh. But when Moses reherced again the law to them in his last days /
they were at the enter of y^ land of byheste in a full plentouous co^tre /
where they were more endyned to lecherye for welfare than to robberye for
mysfare. And therefore Moses for yt time forbade them first couetyse of the
flesh and than couetyse of the eye and of richesse. An other cause leave
friend is this. For all the pilgrimage of the childern of Israel.xl. year in
desert betokens our pilgrimage here in this world from our beginning unto
our ending. In token than yt man and woman in his youth and in his beginning
is sooner tempted to couetyse of the eye and of worldely good / than couetyse
of the flesh / and in his ending and in his age latter tempted to couetyse
of the eye and of worldely good / than to couetyse of the flesh for in old
folk when al other temptacyons cesse / than is temptacyon of couetyse of the
eye and of worldely good most brennynge. For right as their body by age
nygheth to the earth / so their heart clyueth than most to erthely things.
And therefore in the beginning of their pilgrimage in desert as to beginning
folk / god forbadde them first and pryncypaly couetyse of the eye and in the
end of their pilgrimage / as to folk nyghe their end / he forbydeth them
pryncypally and last / and most openly without often rehersynge couetyse of the
eye. For commonly the more that men nygh there end the more couetouse they ben.

Caplm.iij.
Dives. Thy reasons be good say forth what thou will. Pauper God in the sixth
byheste forbydeth the deed of lechery and of spousebreche / and in this byheste
he forbydeth the will and the consent of heart to lecherye and to sponsebreche
For as the deed of leshery is dedely sin so is the foul consent and the
desire of heart dedely sin. For as christ says in the gospel. Mathei.v. He
that sees a woman and coueyteth her by desire to do lecherye with her / he
has do lecherye in his heart though he do it not in deed. And therefore each
man should take heed besely what thoughts enter in to his heart / and if any
thoughts ben about to draw the reason of his soul to consent to sin /
anon put he away tho thoughts myghtely / and let hy^ think on the bitter
pains that christ suffered in his side / hondes and feet / and so turn his
mysluste in to deuoco^n of crystus passion / and quench the brennyng thoughts
of lechery with the blood and the water yt ran out of crystus side when his
heart was cloven a two with that sharp spear / and think on yt endeles love
that christ showed than to him and to all mankind. And so to torn his foul
stynkynge love yt he begins to fall in shame and shenshyp in to the sweet
clean love of Ihu^ full of Joy and worship The master of kind telled li.xij.
yt there is a bird in Egypt yt is called a pellycane / and of al fowls he is
most chere over his birds and most loves them. There is a great enmyte
between him and the adder / wherefore the adder wayteth when the pellycane is out
of his neste to seek mete for him and for his birds / and than he goth in to
the neste of the pellycane / and styngeth his birds and enuenemeth them and
sleeth them / when the pellycane comes again and fyndeth his birds thus slain
he makes much sorrow and moan / and by way of kind three days and three
night he morneth for death of his birds And at the third days end he sets
him again over his birds and with his bylle he smyteth himself in the side and
lets his blood fall down on the birds. And anon as y^ blood touches his
birds / anon by way of kind and by virtue of ye blood they quycken again and
risen from death to life. By this pellycane that loves so well his birds is
understand christ Ihesu gods sone y^ loves man's soul and woman's more
than ever did y^ pellycane his birds. And he says himself. Similis factus
su^ pellicano solitudinis. I am made like to y^ pellycane of deserte. By the
birds I vnde Adam Eve and all mankind. By the nest I understand y^ bliss of
paradyse For right as birds be brought forth in y^ nest / so mankind had his
beginning and was brought forth in paradyse. By y^ adder I understand the
fend which appeared in y^ lyknes of an adder to Eve and stange her full evil
and Adam also with his wicked fondynge and slew them both body and soul And
not only he slew them but also he slew al mankind in them For if Adam had
not sinned we should never have dyed ne have wist of woo wherefore this
pellycane Ihesu christ seeing y^ myscheef y^ mankind was fall in by gyle of y^
fend / he had ruth on mankind / and for great love that he had to mankind /
as saint Poul says he auentysshed himself and took flesh and blood of y^
maiden Mary and bycam man in y^ likeness of a servant and in our manhede and
in our kind suffered to be taken and be bound and beten / forspyted /
dispysed / byscorged at the pyler / be crowned with thorns / be nailed to the
tree hondes and feet / and hanged on the cross as a thief among thieves and
be stonge to the heart with the sharp spear / and so dyed bitter death all for
our gylt and not for his gylt / for he did never amys in word / ne in deed /
as saint Peter says in his pystle. And thus for our love yt ben to him full
unkind / he shed his precious blood out of every part of his blysfull body
born of the maiden. And his Inner heart blood he shed so to wasshe us fro our
sins / and to reyse us fro y^ death of sin into y^ life of grace / and after
fro bodily death into y^ life of endless bliss Therefore saint John says. Dilexit
nos and lauit nos a pccis n^^is i sanguie suo. Apoc. i. He loved us so much yt
he washed us from our sins with his precious blood. Love drove him down fro
heaven into earth / love led hy^ into y^ maidens bosom and brought him into this
wicked world. Love bound hy^ in cradel and wonde hy^ in cloutes full poor and
laid hy^ in an ox stalle. Love held hy^ here in sorrow and care honger and
thryst and much trauayl.xxxij. year and more. At y^ last love took hy^ and
bound hy^ and set hy^ at y^ bar before y^ synful Justice Ponce Pylate. Love
laid him on the cross and nailed hy^ to y^ tree. Love led hy^ to his death and
cleef his heart a two. And for whose love leave friend. Forsooth for love of you
and of me and of other synful wretches yt never did hy^ good but offended him
night and day and ben to him full unkind. Therefore he may well say the words
that Solomon said. Fortis e^ vt mors dilectio. Can^.viij. Love is strong as
death / ye forsooth much strenger than death. For love led his life to his death /
and he that never might dye by way of kind / love made him dye for mankind.
And so says Solomon there. Brondes of his love ben brondes of fire and of
flammes both. For the love that he showed to mankind / and also for the love
that we ought to show to him. For right as the hete of the son with his
light when he shyneth in the fire in the house / wastes the fire and quenches
it / so the love of god and the endelesse charity of his passion if it shone in
man's soul with his hete it should quench and waste the brondes and the fire
of lecherye brennynge in man's soul by foul lust and wicked desire. And
therefore he says to every christian soul. ^one me vt signaculu^ super cor tuu^.
Can^.viij. Set me as a token upon thyn heart. And saint Poul says. Spu^
a^bulate and desideria carnis no^ perficiet^. ad Gala v.^ Go ye with the holy
ghost yt is called well of goostly fire / and ye shall not do the desire of y^
flesh / for deuoco^n and mind of crystus passion is the best remedy against
temptaco^n of lechery.

Caplm.iiij.
ALso it is a good remedy to a man to think on his death and on his freelte
and on the bitter pains of hell ever lasting / and of the high offense of
god and of the endeles Joys that they lose if they assent to lecherye.
Therefore Solomon says. Memorare nouissima tua and in eternu^ no^ peccabis.
Eccl.vij. Think on thy last things and you shall never do sin. Each man
and woman should beware that neither by nyce contenau^ce ne by folly speech / ne
by nyce array of body they styre any man or woman to lecherye. And though
reasonable arraye and honest be commended both in man and woman after their
astate ruled by goddaes law and reason / and so they must be well ware that
by such arraye they fall not in pride ne in lecherye / ne styre other to
lecherye willing and wetynge. We read in vitas patrum / that there was an holy
woman whose name was Alexandre / and she was a full fair woman / and when she
herd say that a man was fallen in to hard temptaco^n of lecherye bycau s;e
of her beauty / she closed herself in an house and would never see man after ne
come out of yt house / but took her living in to her by a small wyked Men
axed her why she did so. And she say that she had lever to shytte herself
all quyck in the grave than to harm any soul that god made to his likeness
and bought so dear with his precious blood. We read also in the life of saint
Bryde / yt a man would have wedded her for her beauty / and she prayed god that
he would sen do her some blemysshynge of her face / whereby that man's
temptacyon might cese. Anon her one eye braste out of her head / wherefore her
fader made her a nu^ne as a woman unable to the world. And wha^ she was made a
nu^ne and had forsaken the world / anon she had her eye and her sight again
Thus should wymen besely keep the^ in chastyte and clennesse / maidens in
chastyte of maydenhode / wydowes in chastyte of wydowehode / wives in chastyte
of wedloke / and keep there body truly to their husbondes / and so y^ husbo^des
truly to their wives. Forsooth it is a dedely sin a man to desire an other
man's wife or his maiden or his daughter to flesshely lust. Much more is it
dedely sin to oppress the^ and defoule them and lie by them.

Caplm.v.
Dives. Saint Poule says / that the flesh desires and couey s;eth always
against y^ soul. And it is full hard to withstand his lusts and his desires.
Pauper Therefore man should govern and chastyse his body / as a good man of
arms governs and chastysed his horse. For as Job says. All our living upon
earth is knyghthode and fyghtyng against y^ fend y^ world and y^ flesh. Job
vij. And in this battle our body is our horse which we must chastyse and
rule as a knight does his horse. For if y^ horse be to proud and evil tached
he may lightly lose his master and becau s;e of his death. And if he be tame to
his master and well tached / it shall do him worship and help him at need and
in case save his life. Three things ben nedeful to the knight to rule well his
horse. He must have a brydel and sadel and two spores. By the brydel I under
s;tande abstynence and travail / by the which the flesh must be refrayned
fro his lusts and his evil tacches when he begins to wexe proud and
wynsynge and kykyng against his master yt is the soul. And if he be over
proud and to rebel to his master / he must have a sharp brydel of sharp
abstynence and of hard travail. And if he be meke and tretable / give him a
smothe brydel of easy abstynence and of common travail. The raynes of thy
brydel should be two parts of temporau ce / yt is to say / neither to much ne
to little knyt togydre in a knot of good discreco^n. And than thyn (...) shall go
right forth in the way (...) life and bear the to heavenly bliss. (...) ^hou
give thy flesh to much me^^ drink and ease / it will be thy may^ter and
slay the. And if thou give it to little / it shall be to feeble and fail the at
need and let the of thy Iourneye. The sadell of thyn horse shall be pacyence
and meekness / that thou be pacyente in adnersyte and in sickness / yt you
follow not the grutchynges and y^ sterynges of thy flesh. The steroppes of
thy sadell should be lowenesse and sadness. Lowenesse against pride sadness
against the world and the flesh. That thou be not to sorry for no woe / ne to
glad for no well ne for no welfare. Sytte sadely in thy sadell and keep well
thy steroppes / and for no pride ne for no wrath / for no sickness / for no
aduersyte / let not thy horse cast (...) down out of y^ sadel of pacyence /
but than sit fast by the virtue of goostly strength / and keep thy soul in
the sadel of pacyence / as christ byddeth in the gospel when he says. In
paciencia vra^ possidebi^^ ai^as vra^s. Ye shall keep your souls in your
pacyence. And as the sadell makes an horse semely and plesau^t to the sight /
so pacyence makes a man plesau^t to the sight of god and of men and makes
them have love in every company where they ben. And wrath and Inpacyence and
hastynes makes a man vnplesau^t and without love. Of this sadel god spoke to
Caym when he was wroth with his brother Abel / why said god art you wroth and why
is thy face and thy there so fallen / for he was fallen out of the sadell of
pacyence. If you do well you shall resceyue of me good mede / and if you do evil
anon thy sin comes at y^ yate to be punysshed. But the desire of sin shall
be under the and in thy power / as the horse under the knight / and thou shall
be lord thereof if thou wylt. Gen^. iiij. But Caym by mysgouernau^ce of his
horse fell out of his sadel of pacyence into manslaughter of his brod / for he
would not keep hy^ in y^ sadel of pacyence ne refrain the wicked desire of his
flesh / and therefore god cursed hy^ first of all men. Therefore leave friend
keep you well in the sadel of pacyence / and let no anger / ne loss of catell
/ ne death of friends / none aduersyte / no trybula cyon / no sickness vnsadel
you of pacyence. But sytte ye fast as Job did / and say ye as he said when he
had lost all his good / and all his childern were slain / and himself
smyten with hard sickness and horrible and foul / than he said thus. If we
have taken good things of gods hand / why should not we suffer wyked
things and paynfull of his sond. God yaue and god has taken away / as god
will so it is done / blessed be our lords name. Job.i.et.ij.ca. Thus sytte ye
sadely in the sadell of pacyence / and rule ye your horse by the brydell of
abstynence / and by the reins of temperau^ce / and if your horse be so dulle
in gods way / pryke him with two spores that been diede of hell pain / and
love of god and of heaven bliss. And so with dread and love compelle ye your
horse to hye him forth in gods way. Let not your horse y^ is your flesh be
to carnalle by ease and welfare / ne to feeble for mysfa^e and ouertrauayle.

THe master of kind li.iiij. de qualitate elementari. tells that there is a
bird that is called a bernake. This bird wexeth out of a tree over the water.
But as long as it hanged on the tree / it is deed / but anon as it louseth
from y^ tree and falls down in to the water / anon it quykeneth and
swymmeth forth. This bird says he has little flesse and less blood. By
this tree I understand mankind that came al of Adam and Eve / as the tree and
his branches come al of y^ rote byneth By this bird I understand every man
and woman which when they be first born of their mother they be deed by
orygynal sin of Adam and not able to the life of grace ne of bliss. For as
saint Poule says / we ben all born childern of wrath and of death. But anon as
we fall in to y^ ^on^stone and in y^ water of baptyme and ben baptized / anon
we resceyue y^ ly^ / of grace / and be able to y^ life of heaven bliss / if we
keep us besely from the blood of sin / and from y^ carnalyte of the body and
desytes of y^ flesh. For saint Peter byddeth us. Abstinete vos a carnalibus
desiderijs que milita^t aduersus ai^am.i. Petri.ij. Absteyne ye you from
flesshely desires yt fight against the soul. But for as much as Job says that
all man's life upon earth is knyghthode and fyghtyng against goostly enemies.
Milicia e^ vi ta hoi^s super terra^. Job.vij. Therefore it is needful to every
christian man to govern well the horse of his body as I have said. But more over
as saint Poule says. He mnste arm hy^ with goostley armure against the dyntes
and the darts of the fendes temptacyon For as saint Poule says ad Ephesians. vi.
All our fighting is against the wicked spyrytes of derkenesses / which be
princes and powers and governors of sinful men. Therefore he says. Arm ye
you in the armure of god that ye may withstand the busshement and the slyghtes
of the devil / and stand parfyght in all things. Stand ye says he in treuth
/ and gyrde ye your lendes with the gyrdel of chastyte / and do ye on the
habergeon of right fullness / and shoe ye your feet in dyghtynge of y^ gospel
of peace. And in all things take ye to you the shield of faith with which ye
may quench all the brennynge darts of y^ wicked fend And take ye you y^
basyn^et of health and the sword of the holy ghost / that is gods word /
which as he says in another place is sharper than any two egged sword. ad
Hebre.iiij. And by almaner prayers and besechynge pray ye every time and
always in spirit / and wake ye always in him in all manner business. And thus
saint Poule by the likeness of bodily armure techeth us goostly armure / and
techeth us well to arm our lendes by the virtue of chastyte / when he byddeth
us gyrde well our lendes. And than he byddeth us do on the habergeon of
ryghtfulnesse in defense both of body and soul / y^ we do right to all and
yield to god and to every creature yt longs to him / both to our soueraynes
and to our fellows and to our sugettes / and to them that been before us paste
out of this world / by alms gyuynge / and yeldynge of dettes for them that been deed / and to them that been behind us to come by saving of their right
and of their due heritage. And thus arm we us behind and before and in every
side with the habergeon of ryghtfulnesse. And right as in the habergeon every
ring accords with other and is knytt with other. So should all our ryghtfulnes
accord to gydre and so be knytt to gydre yt we do right to all / so yt we do
no man ne woman wrong. For if we do so much right and favor to one that it
be hyndrynge to an others right / than y^ rings in our haberge^ of ryghtfulnes
accord not ne be well knytt to gydre. But there is an hole whereby the fend may
hurt our soul. Also he byddeth us arm our feet and our legs with leg
harneys that is goostly pouerte yt we withdraw our hertes and our affeccyons
from erthely things / and not set our love to much in erthly things / ne in
worldely goods / not to strive / not to plete for no worldely goods / but y^
more need compel us thereto / but seek to live in peace with all men if it may
be. And thus arm us with goostly poue^te our legs and our feet that is to
say / our love and our affecco^ns against the temptacyons of false couetyse.
And therefore he byddeth us shoe our feet in to y^ dyghtynge of the gospel of
peace. For every christian man and woman ought to have gostly pouerte which christ
taught in the gospel / and to forther the gospel of christ / that is the
gospel of peace in will and deed to his power / and to teache it if he can. And
if he can not / help and forther them yt can in techynge of the gospel and of
gods law / and help the^ with his good to their needful sustenaunce if he
may and they have need. Also he byddeth us take to us the shield of faith / for
as the shield is a tryangle and has three corners / in which tryangle if fro
y^ mids be drawn three lines in to the three corners / there should be three
tryangles / which three be but one tryangle / and yet none of them is other.
And therefore he says / that faith of the holy trynyte is lykened to a shield /
for there ben three persons in y^ holy trynyte / the fader / the sone / and the
holy ghost / and each of them is god / and none of them is either / and though
they ben al three but one god in mageste. This shield of faith of the holy
trynyte we must take to us in goostly fight and believe in the holy trynyte /
and set all our faith and al our trust in one god in trynyte / and pray to
the fader almighty / that he send us might to the sone alwy^^ / that he
grant us wit and wysed^me to the holy ghost all gracyous and full of mercy /
that he grant us grace so that we may have might wit and grace to
withstand all goostly enemies. Also he byddeth us to take to us the balynet of
health and of salvation / as says the gloss / hope to have the maystrye of our
enemies by the help of god / and heaven bliss to our mede for our fighting
and for our travail. For there will no man put him to laufull fight / but in
hope to have the maystrye and mede for his travail. And as the basynet well
arrayed is clean furbusshed from ruste / and made slyke and smothe that shot may
soon glyde of and it is highest of all armure going and gaderynge upward in
to a small point / so must our hope and our trust pryncypaly go up to god /
and not set our hope ne our trust to much in man's might ne in erthely help
/ which is but ruste wasting the basynet of hope yt we owe to god. Therefore
says the prophet Ieremye. Cursed be the man that trusts in man and in
flesshely might / and lets his heart go away fro god. And blyssed be that
man / which sets his hope and his trust in our lord god. Jeremy. xvij.
Also saint Poule byddeth that we should take with us rerebras and vanbras and
gloves of pla^e / that is t^ say good occupacyons and business in good
works. And therefore he byddeth us wake in all manner business of good works
For as the wise man says Eccl.xxxiij. Ydelshyp and sloth is cause of much
wickedness. For an ydel man and lustles is like a man hondeles and wepenles
among his enemies / and like a man in battle with naked arms and hondes /
which for nakedness and for defaute of armure leseth both arm and hand.
Also we must do above the Jack or the acton of charity. For as the Jack is
soft and nesshe and by his softness and nesshenesse softeth and feynteth all
strokes yt comes there against / so charity softeth and feynteth all the
dentees of the fendes temptaco^n. Therefore saint Poule says / that charity
suffers all thing pacyently and makes every travail soft and bears al
thing easily. Omnia suffertoi a sustinet.i. ad Little.xiiij. And therefore says
the gloss there / that charity and pacyence and benygnyte with compassyon of
others myscheef ben the pryncypall armure y^ longs to christian people. This
Jack of charity is betokened by the cloth of christ without seem all won
above in to one / which in time of his passion the knights would not kyt /
but kept it hole and cast lot who should have it hole In token yt every good
knight of god should be besy to arm him with the cloth and the Jack and the
armure of charity / and travail to save peace and unity / and make no dyuysyon.
For the end of every battle should be peace / and to y^ end and for none
other men of arms should travail and fight / as saint Austen says. Thus leave
friend I prayr you yt ye arm you in goostly armure as gods good knight. For
though ye be not able to bodily batayl / ye be yet able to goostly fight In
that yt ye be christian ye be crystus knight ordained to fight in this gostly
battle if ye will be saved. And therefore a^me ye you well as I ha^^ now said /
and gyrde ye you with the sword of gods word / by which ye should defend
you from all goostly enemies. For as the sword perseth / kytteth / and makes
separaco^n / so gods word / and prechynge techynge and redynge of gods
word and of gods law perseth man's heart and woman's and makes separaco^n
between sinful souls and their sin / and departs atwynne wicked company
and makes separaco^n of man's heart from erthely couetyse. Therefore christ
says that he came not to make synful peace but to send sword of separacyon in
earth to destroy wyked peace y^ men have in their sin. Therefore leave friend
as gods good knight gyde ye you with this sword of gods word / that is to
say / fastne ye it well in your heart by herynge and redynge / by techynge and
by deed doing / and than take ye to you the spear of crystus passion / and
think how he was smyten to the heart for your sake with that sharp spear / and
his side opened and his heart cloven a two to show you how much he loved you.
And than he shed out his heart blood and water in token that if he had had
mo^^ blood more he would have shed for your love. Moreover ye shall
understand y^ in bodily fight a man must chese him a good ground and a plain
place to fight in. For it is not good ryghtynge in myres ne among corn in
slydre way and pytty ground / ne in stoble ground. And therefore saint Poul by
^ death us stand in treuthe and equity that in all our doing we look to our
ground and our cause be true and rightful cler^e and clean and make no strife
in uncertain. Also a wise knight in his fight will take with him y^ hylle and
the son and wind if he may / and so must we in gostly fight take with us y^
hylle of holy living y^ we may say with y^ apostle. Nra^ ^uersaco^ in celis e^.
Our living and conuersaco^n is in heuens and in heavenly things. And therefore
saint Poul byddeth us stand perfyte in all things. Also we must take with us in
our fight the son and y^ light of gods grace / and the* wind of holy
prayer And therefore saint Poul byddeth us pray in every time and always / by
all manner prayer and besechynge in y^ holy ghost / yt is to say with the grace
of the holy ghost. In this manner leave friend arm ye you in goostly armure /
and dyspo s;e ye you to gostly batayl against al goostly enemies / and govern
ye well your horse of your body as I have said. Let it not be to feeble by
ouerdone abstynense and tranayll / ne to wild by ouerdone rest / by glotony /
by l^^chery by wicked desires of y^ flesh and evil wylles / for in caas such
wicked wylles and desires ben dedly sin in gods sight and against this last
commandment Therefore Dauyd says that god preued and knows man's heart and
his lendes / yt is to say / god knows man's will and his lust For he knows
more verily y^ thought of me^nes heart and wyme^s / than any man may know y^
others works. He sees and knows al thing / and therefore such as man or
woman is in heart and in soul and in will such he is before god that knows
both body and soul.

Caplm.vij.
NOw leave friend I have in part declared you the.x. commandments / by
which ye must govern your life if ye will be saved. For christ says to each
man and woman. Si vis ad vitam ingredi serua mandata Math.xix. If y^ wylt enter
everlasting life / keep gods commandments And therefore do ye as Solomon
says Deu^ time et mandata eius obserua. hoc est ois homo. Eccl. vltimo. Dread
ye god and keep his commandments / this is every man and woman. For as much
as man or woman pleseth god by keeping of his byhestes / so much is he in
gods sight. And as much as man or woman is in gods syhht so much he is
and no more / as says saint Ansten de ci.li.xx.ca.iiij. For as he says / there
is no^ man ought but the keeper of gods commandments For as he says / who
so is not keeper of gods commandment he is naught for he is not reformed
again to the likeness of treuth yt he was made after / but dwells still in
the likeness of vanyte that he was not made to. Therefore Dauyd said. Maledicti
qui declina^t a mandatis tuis. Cursed be they yt bow away fro thy
commandments and will not keep them. We read in holy write. Deut^.xxvij.
That god bad y^ childern of Israel yt when they came newely in to y^ land of

Joseph and Beniamyn should stand on y^ hylle of Garizym there to thank god
and to bless all the kepers of gods law. And against them should stand
other vi. kynredes of Jacob / yt is to say. Ruben Gad. Aser. Zabulon. Dan. and
Neptilym. on y^ hylle yt hight Ebal and curse with high voice all y^ break gods

heart to set his faith and his trust therein / so to worship it with his heart
Inward / and at gods bidding all the people should answer and say amen So
mote it be. Cursed be he that not worshyppeth fader and mod / amen said the
people. Cursed be he yt flytteth the bounds and the doles or terms of his
neighbor / and puts him out of his right / amen said all the people. Cursed
be he yt makes the blind to will or to err in his way / amen said al y^
people. Cursed be he yt peruerteth the ryghtful dome of the comelynge and of
the stranger and of the faderlesse child and of the moderlesse child / and
of the wydowe / amen said all the people Cursed be he that lies by his faders
wife / or by any of his nygh kynrede / or of nygh affynyte / amen said all the

amen said all the people Cursed be he yt takes gifts to slay him yt is not
gylty / amen said all the people. Cursed be he yt dwells not in the words of
gods law / ne does them not in deed / amen said all the people. This is the
high curse and the solemn sentence which god gives to all tho y^ will not
keep his byhestes and law / and what curse and myscheef should fall to them
y^ wyttyngly or willing break his byhestes / he shows in the same book the
next chaptre where he says thus.

curses of temporal myscheef fall as soon to the good as to the wicked.
Pauper. Temporal myscheef sometime falls to a person in special / sometime
to comonte in general. In special it falls sometime for sin / sometime
without sin / to encreasynge of a man's mede. But than yt mysche^f is no
curse but a louetyk of god. But common myscheef falls not to the comonte / but
for sin of the comonte. And of s^che common myscheues that should fall to the
people / if they despised gods byhestes speaks god in that plale. And such
common myscheues y^ fall to the comonte for common sin be called curses. Dives
Why were tho six kynredes of Jacob so assygned of god to curse the brekers of
gods law / and the other six assygned to bless the kepers of gods law.
Pauper. Them that were most ungentle of birth god assygned to curse / for all
tho six sons of Jacob were borne of the secondarye wives that were but
servants to his chyfe wives Lya and Rachell / saaf Ruben / which lost his
worship for yt he lay by his faders secondary wife that hight Bala The other
six hyn^redes were born gentle of birth / for they were born of the pryncypall
and more gentle wives Lya and Rachell / four of Lya / and two of Rachell. And
therefore god ordained them to bless / in token that no man should be chosen
to preesthode / but he were gentle by wantynge of cursed condyco^ns. And also
in token that it is more kyndely to worshypfull persons as all prestes should
be to bless than to curse. And therefore bysshoppes and other prestes should
not curse but for a full grievous open sin and for great need. Therefore saint
Po^le says to men of perfeccyon as all prestes should be. Benedicite. et
nolite maledicere. Bless ye and be ye not in will ne ready to curse but for
great need / and that it be done in charity to worship. For cursynge in the
self is a deed of Imperfecco^n. And therefore god chose them that were most
Imperfyte and lest worshypfull of birth to pronounce the curse / and the
most perfyte and worshypful in birth to pronounce his blessing to the kepers
of his law / which said thus in gods name to the people.

OF this cite speaks saint Johan in the book of gods preuytees.xxi. ca. and
says thus. The angel led me in spirit by vysyon in to an full high hylle
and a full great / and there he showed me the holy cite of Jerusalem ordained
of god / and having the bryghtnesse and the beauty of god. The light of this
cite was like the precious stone I^spis and crystel which stone betokens
christ son of ryghtwysnesse / which says in the gospel. Ego su^ lux mu^di.
Io.viij. I am light of y^ world. This cite had a wall ^ull high / and it
had.xij. yates / and each yate.xij. angels redye porters to lead in all good
souls / and in the yates were written all the names of the xij. kynredes of
Israel / that is to say of all yt shall be saved and be able to see god in his
face For the names of al yt shall be saved ben regystred in y^ book of life in
heaven and ready written in the yates of heaven against our coming / in token y^ we
shall be welcome and syker of our bliss if we do ^ur devour This cite stood in
square and it had three yates in to the cest / three in y^ north three in the
south / and three in to the west in token y^ out of four parts of the world /
that is to say / out of every part of the world souls enter in to heaven
bliss of young and old / rich and poor by the faith of the holy trynyte
that is betokened by the three ya^es Young folk ben understand by the eest
there the day begins. Old folk by the weste there the day ends. Rich
folk by the south. Poor folk by the north / for yt co^t^^ is most sharp
and bareyne. The wall of the cite was set and grounded on.xij. precious
stones. The first was Iaspis / the.ij. Saphirus / the.iij. Calcidonius /
the.iiij Smaragdus / the.v. Sardenix / the.vi. Sardinus / the.vij. Crisolitus /
the.viij Berillus / the.ix. Topasius / the.x. Crisopassus / the.xi. Iacinctus /
the.xij. Amati s;tus. And in tho stones were written the names of the.xij.
apostles and of gods lombe. And all the wall was made of precious stones /
and the yates made of Saphires and Smaragdes as Tobye says in his book.xiij.
ca. And as saint John says / every yate was as a Margaryte or Margery stone.
The streets of ye cite were clean gold as clear as glass / and as Tobye says
y^ streets of this cite were paued with full white clean stone / and always in the
siretes is song alleluya / which song could never clerk well declare ne
expowne to the vtterest / for the Joy the mirth / the melodye / and gladness
that is there may no tongue tell / ne heart think / ne hand write / ne wit
deuyse and declare. In this cite saint John saw no temple / for almighty and
gods lombe christ Ihesus verry god and man he is the temple of this cite This
cite as says saint John needs neither son ne moan. For the bryghtnesse of
god well of light and the son of ryghtfulnesse Illumyneth this cite. The
lombe christ Ihesus is the lantern and the light of this cite. All nacyons and
peoples shall go^ in the light of this cite / and bring their nobley / their
bliss / their worship in to this cite. The yates of this cite shall never be
shytte. There shall be no night but always day / always somer and never winter.
In to this cite shall come no foul thing / no false liar / no forswerer / ne
none that does abhomynaco^n of dedely sin There shall no man enter but they
that been written in the book of life and in the life of the lombe christ Ihesus yt
bought us so dear with his blood.

ANd as said a great clerk doctor de Lyra by the.xij. precious stones / on
which this cite is grounded / in which stones the names of the.xij. apostles
be written ben understand the.xij. artycles of the faith / which the.xij.
apostles gadred in to one creed / in which.xij. artycles all our salvation is
set and grounded. And therefore saint Poule says. Fide statis* Stand ye in
faith / for our faith is ground of our saluaco^n. By the.xij. yates ben
understand the ten co^masidemente / and the two commandments of charity. Of
which yates christ says. Si vis ad vitam ingredi serua mandata. Math.xix. If
thou wylt enter in to the life of this blysful cite there noman dies / keep
thou the commandments. This scripture is written in every yate of this cite /
in token that in to this cite comes no man ne woman b^t y^ kepers of gods
commandments. For the commandments ben the yates of heaven / by which we
must enter / and they ben also the way ledynge to the yate of heaven. And
therefore Dauyd says. Viam mandatoabrum tuoabrum cucurri. cu^ di latasti cor
meu^. p^o. C.xviij. I ran the way of the commandments when thou made
mine ^rrte large by charity. For when men be to strayte at the breast by false
couetyse and nygardshyp / they may not well run in the way of gods
byhestes. For falls couetyse byndeth them so strayt at the heart that they
have no liking in gods byhestes. Therefore Dauyd said. Deduc me dn^e in
semita ma^da toabrum tuoabrum. qr ip^am volui. Inclina cormeu deus in
testimonia tua aet no^ in auaricia^. p^o. C.xviij. Lord led you me in the
pathe of thy commandments / for it is my desire and my will to goo that
way. Bow mine heart in to thy wytnessynges and in to thy co^mau^deme t^ / and
not in to auaryce and couetyse Thus leave friend holy wrytt and holy men declare
y^ bliss of heaven by things vysyble yt we may see at eye / so to lead us in
to knowing of the bliss yt we may see with our bodily eye while we live in the
land of death. But leave friend believe ye it forsooth y^ there is an hundred
thousand thousand fold more bliss than any tongue may tell / or any heart
think.

Dives. If men had sad faith to have such bliss for their good deeds /
there would no man ne woman do a mys for dread to lose y^ bliss. Pauper. It
fares by folk born in prison of ye wicked world as it does by a child born
in the deep derke pytte of the prison / when it falls a woman with child be
put in prison. The mother that knows the welfare y^ she had out of prison is
in much sorrow and care and longs full much to be out of prison again in her
welfare. But the child born in the myscheef of the prison and never had
knowing of better fare gives little tale of that myscheue in prison. But
aslonge as he has his mother with him and his sustenau^ce though it be full
feeble / he makes no sorrow ne care / he longs after no better fare / for he
knows no better. For if his mother tells him of y^ Joy and welfare out of
prison / of the son moan and of the sterres of y^ fair flowers spryngynge
upon earth / of the birds singing / of myrthe / of melodye of rich arraye /
of lords / of ladies / and wealth yt is out of prison / all her tale is but a
dreme to the child / he byleueth it not / and therefore he longs not
thereafter / and will not for all this bliss and the welfare that she speaks
of forsake his mother ne the feeble fare yt he has with her / and that is for he
byleueth it not / and yet it is as the mother tells the child. But were the
child ones out of prison and saw the wealth and mirth and the welfare which
his mother told him of / he would be full sorry for to go again to prison there
to live with his mother. For all his life in prison that was first liking
enough to hy^ should than be full bitter / and he should never have Joy ne
rest in heart till he came again to yt welfare yt he saw out of prison. Right
thus folk of this world borne and brought forth in sorrow and care and much
trauayl in the prison of this world / they have so much love and liking to
their erthly mother and to there company / that is to say / in earth and in
erthely things / for earth is mother of all that they have no liking in heavenly
things / ne long not thereafter. And yet their gostly mother holy church and
there goostly fader and god him self fader of all tells them of the bliss of
heaven. It is to them but a dreme / as is the moders tale to her child in
prison / and they have no sad faith therein. And though it be so as our mod
holy church tells us though the child believe not that such welfare be out
of prison / the welfare is never the less / and though erthely couetouse men
have no liking but in earth and in erthly things believe not y^ such bliss be
in heaven yet there is such bliss and never the less for their false believe.
But had they ones seen and assayed a little of that bliss / all the Joy and
liking yt they have in this world and in erthly things should be to them
full great bytternesse full of sorrow and care. Example we have of saint Peter
whom Christ led upon the hylle of Thabor with saint John and saint James /
and there he showed them but a little of the bliss of his manhood. His face
shone as bright as the son / his clothes were white as snow. Moses and Hely
appeared with him in great bliss and magestee. Than Peter said to our lord
Ihesu Lord it is good to us to be here. Make we here three tabernacles / one to
the an other to Moses / and an other to Hely / and let us all dwell here.
Luce.ix. And anon in sight of little bliss he forgot all the bliss of this
world. He cared neither for mete drink ne clothing / for him thought he
might have lived without end by the blysfull sight and with that company. Also
when saint Poule was rauysshed in to heaven and had seen y^ vysyon of god
afterward all his life in this world was to him a pain / so much he longed
again to yt bliss. And therefore he said. Infelix ego quis me liberabit demorte
corperis huius. To.vij. I an vnsely man who shall deliver me fro y^ death of
this body I coueyte to be departed the soul from the body and be without end
with christ. Moses was with god in the mount of Synay.xl. days. and xl. nyghtes
metelesse and drynkeles fedd by the speech of god and by his presence / and yet
saw he but little of this bliss. For he was not able to see his bliss / ne
noman living in this world / as god said to him y^ time. But leave friend
after our death if we keep well gods commandments and amend our misdeeds
by our life / we shall see his great bliss which neither Peter ne Poule ne
Moses might see in earth. And we shall be syker of that bliss without end.
Which bliss as saint Poule says y^ none erthely eye may see / ne ere here /
ne heart think / ne wit comprehend. In this bliss leave friend I hope to
see you and dwell with you in the high cite of Jerusalem in the kings court
of heaven. To which bliss he bring us / that for us dyed on the rode tree.
Amen.
