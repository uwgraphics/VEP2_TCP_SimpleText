THE Testament of Cresseid.
ANE doolie sessoun to ane cairfull dyte
Should correspond, and be equivalent.
Richt sa it was quhen I began to write
This tragedy, the wedder richt fervent
Quhen Aries in middis of the Lent
Schouris of Haill can fra the North descend
That scantly fra the cauld I micht defend.
Zit nevertheless within mine Oratur
I stude, quhen Titan had his bemis bricht
Withdrawin down, and sylit under cure
And fair Uenus the beauty of the nicht
Uprais, and fet unto the west full richt
Her goldin face in oppositioun
Of God Phoebus direct discending down.
Throw out the glass her bemis brast sa fair
That I micht se on every side me by
The Northin wind had purifyit the Air
And sched the mistie cloudis fra the sky,
The froist freisit the blastis bitterly
Fra Pole Artick come quhifling loud and schill,
And causit me remufe aganis my will.
For I traistit that Uenus luifis Quen^
To quhome some time I hecht obedience,
My faidit heart of lufe scho wald make grene,
And thereupon with humbill reverence,
I thocht to pray her hie Magnificence,
Bot for greit called as than I lattit was
And in my Chalmer to the fire can pas
Thocht lufe be hait, it in ane man of ege
It kendillis nocht sa sone as in outheid,
Of quhome the blude is flowing in ane rage,
And in the auld the curage doif and deid:
Of quhilk the fire outward is best remeid
To help be Phisike quhair that nature faillit
I am expert, for both I have assaillit.
I mend the fire and beikit me about
Than tuik ane drink my spreitis to comfort
And armit me weill f^a the cauld thairout
To cut the winter nicht and make it schort.
I tuik ane Quair and left all other sport.
Writtin be worthy Chaucer glorious
Of fair Creisseid, and worthy Troylus.
And their I fand after that Diomeid
Ressauit had that Lady bri^ht of hew.
How Troilus n^ir out of wit abraid,
And weipit soir with visage paill of hew,
For quhilk wanhope his teiris can renew
Quhill Esperus reioisit him agane
Thus quhyle in Joy he leuit quhyle in pane.
Of her behest he had greit comforting
Traisting to Troy that scho should make retour,
Quhilk he desyrit may of eirdly thing
For quhy scho was his only Paramour,
Bot quhen he saw passit both day and ho^r
Of her ganecome, than sorrow can oppres
His woeful heart in cair and heuines.
Of his distres me neidis nocht reheirs,
For worthy Chauceir in the samin buik
In gudelie termis, and in Ioly veirs
Compysit hes his cairis, quha will luik.
To brek my sleip ane other quair I tuik,
In quhilk I fand the fatal destenie
Of fair Cresseid, that endit wretchitlie.
Quha wait gif all yt Chauceir wrait was true
Nor I wait nocht gif this narratioun
Be authoreist or fene it of the new
Be sum Poeit, throw his Inuentioun
Maid to report the Lamentatioun
And woeful end of this lusty Creisseid,
And quhat distres scho thoillit, and quhat deid.
Quhen Diomeid had all his appetyte,
And mair fulfillit of this fair Lady
Upon ane other he set his haill delight
And send to her ane Lybel^ of repudie
And her excludit fra his company.
Than desolait scho walkit up and down,
And sum men sayis into the Court commoun.
O fair Creisseid the flour and A perse
Of Troy and Greece, how was thou fortunait?
To change in filth all thy Feminitie
And be with fleschelie lust sa maculait
And go amang the Greikis air and lait
Sa giglotlike tak and thy foull plesance
I have piety thou should fall sic mischance.
Zit nevertheless quhat ever men deem or say^
In scornful langage of thy brukkilnes,
I sall excuse als far forth as I may
Thy womanheid, thy wisdom and fairnes
The quhik Fortoun hes put to sic distres
As her pleisir, and nathing throw the gilt
Of the, throw wickit langage to be spilt.
This fair Lady in this wise destitute
Of all comfort, and consolatioun,
Richt priuelie but fellowschip on fute
Disagysit passit far out of the town
Ane mile or two, unto ane Mansioun
Beildit full gay, quhair her Father Calchas
Quhilk than amang the Greikis dwelland was.
Quhen he her saw, the cans he can Inquyre
Of her cumming, scho said siching full soir
Fra Diomeid had gottin his desire
He wox werie, and wald of me no moir.
Quod Calchas, douchter weip thou not thairfoir
Perau^nture all cummis for the best,
Welcum to me, thou art full deir ane Gest.
This auld Calchas, after the Law was tho
Was keiper of the Tempill as ane Priest
In quhilk Uenus and her Sone Cupido
War honourit, and his Chalmer was thaine neist,
To quhilk Cresseid with baill an^uch in breist
Us it to pas, her prayer is for to say
Quhill at the last, upon ane Solemn day,
As custom was, the pepill far and neir
Befoir the none, unto the Tempill went,
With Sacrifice deuoit in their maneir,
Bot still Cresseid, heuie in her Intent
Into the Kirk wald not her self present
For giving of the pepill any deming,
Of her expuls fra Diomeid the King.
Bot past into ane secreit Orature
Quhair schomicht weip her woeful desteny,
Behind her bak scho cloisit fast the dure
And on her kneis bair fell down in hy
Upon Uenus and Cupide angerly
Scho cry it out, and said on this same wise,
Allace that ever I maid ow Sacrifice,
Ze gave me anis ane divine responsaill,
That I should be the flour of luif in Troy,
Now am I maid ane unworthy outwaill
And all in cair translatit is my Joy,
Quha sall me gyde? quha sall me now conuo^
Sen I fra Diomeid and Nobill Troylus
Am clean excludit, as abject odious.
O falls Cupide is nane to wit bot thou,
And thy Mother, of lufe the blind Gods,
Ze causit me alwayis understand and trow
The seid of lufe was saw in in my face,
And ay grew grene throw our supply and grace
Bot now allace that seid with froist is slane
And I fra luiffe it is left and all forlane.
Quhen this was said down in ane ^xtasie
Rauischit in spreit intill ane dream scho fell
And be apperance hard quhair scho did ly
Cupide the King ring and ane silver bell,
Quhilk men micht heir fra heuin unto hell
At quhais sound befoir Cupide appeiris
The seuin Planetis discending fra their Spheiris.
Quhilk hes power of all thing generabill
To reull and steir be their greit Influence,
Wedder and wind, and coursis variabill,
And first of all Saturn gave his sentence
Quhilk gave to Cupide litill reverence,
Bot as ane busteous Churl on his maneir
Come ^rabitlie with auster luik and chei^.
His face fro^nit, his lyre was like the Leid.
His teith chatterit, and cheuerit with the Chin.
His Ene drowpit, how so^kin in his heid
Out of his Nois the Me^drop fast can ri^,
With lippis bla and cheikis leine and thin
The Ice schoklis that fra his hair down hang
Was wonder greit, and as ane speir als lang.
A toui^ his belt his lyart lokkis lay
Felterit vn^air, ouirfret with Froistis hoir,
His garmound and his gyis full gay of gray
His widderit weid fra him the wind out woir,
Ane busteous bow within his hand he boir
Under his girdill ane flasche of felloun flanis
Fedderit with Ice, and heidit with hailstanis
Than Iuppiter richt fair and amiabill,
God of the Staruis in the Firmament,
And Nure is to all thing generabill
Fra his Father Saturn far different,
With burelie face, and browis bricht and brent
Upon his heid ane Garland wonder gay
Of flouris fair as it had been in May
His voice was cleir, as Cristall were his Ene
As goldin wyre sa glitterand was his hair,
His garm^und and his gyis full of grene
With goldin listis gilt on every gair.
Ane burelie brand about his middill bair
In his richt hand he had ane groundin speir,
Of his Father the wraith fra us toweir.
Nixt after him come Mars the God of Ire,
Of strife, debait, and all dissensioun,
To chide and fecht, als feirs as any fire
In hard Harnes, hewmound and Habirgeoun,
And on his hanche ane roustie fell Fachioun,
And in his hand he had ane roustie sword
Wrything his face with money angry word.
Schaikand his sword befoir Cupide he come
With reid visage, and grisly glowrand Ene,
And at his mouth ane bullar stude of foam
Like to ane Bair quhetting his Tuskis kene,
Richt Tuileour like but temperance in tone
Ane horn he blew, with money bosteous brag
Quh^ik all this world with weir hes maid to wag
Than fair Phoebus, Lantern and Lamp of licht
Of man and beist, both fruit and flourisshing,
Tender Nureis, and vanischer of nicht,
And of the world causing be his moving
And Influence, life in all eirdlie thing
Without comfort of quhome, of force to nocht
Must all ga die that in this world is wrocht
As King Royal he raid upon his Chair
The quhilk Phaeton gydit sum time vpricht
The brichtnes of his face quhen it was bair
Nane micht behald for peirsing of his sicht.
This goldin Cart with fyrie be mis bricht
Four okkit steidis full different of he^
But bait or tyring throw the Spheiris drew.
The first was soyr, with Mane als reid as Rois
Cailit E^ye into the Orient.
The secund steid to Name hecht Ethios
Quhitlie and paill, and sum deili ascendent,
The third Peros, richt hait and richt fervent,
The feird was blak, callit Philologie
Quhilk rollis Phoebus down into the sey.
Uenus was their present that Gods
Her ^onnis querrell for to defend and make
^ir awin complaint, ^^ed in ane nyce array,
The ane half grene, the v^her ha^^ Sabill blak
Quhyte hair as gold kemmit and sched abak
Bot in her face semit grei^ variance,
Quhy^es perfyte treuth, and quhyles Inconstance.
Under smyling scho was dissimulait,
Prouocatiue, with ^ien^is Amorons,
And suddanely changit and alte^aif.
Angry as any Serpent vennemous
Richt pungitiue, with wordis odious.
Thus variant scho was, quha list tak keip
With ane Eye lauch, and with the other weip.
In taikning that all fleschelie Paramour
Quhilk Uenus hes in reull and governance.
Is sum time sweit, sum time bitter and sour
Richt vnstabill, and full of variance
Mingit with cairfull Joy and falls plesance,
Now hait, now cauld, now blyith, now sull of w^
Now grene as leif, now widdderit and ago.
With buik in hand than come Mercurius
Richt Eloquent, and full of Rethorie,
With polite termis and delicious
With pen and Ink to report all reddi^
Setting sangis and singand merrily:
His Hude was reid hek^^t atouir his Croun
Like to ane Poeit of the auld fassoun.
Boxis he bair with fine Electuairis,
And sugerit S^ropis for digestioun.
Spycis belangand to the Pothecairis
With money hailsum sweit Confectioun,
Doctor in Physic cled in ane Skarlot goun,
And furrit weill, as sic ane aucht to be,
Honest and good, and not ane word culd lie.
Nixt after him come Lady Cynthia
The last of all, and swiftest in her Spheir,
Of color blak, buskit with hornis two.
And in the nicht scho list is best appeir.
Haw as the Leid, of color nathing cleir
For all her li^ht scho borrowis at her brother
Titan, for of her self scho hes nane other.
^ir gyse was gray, and hal^ of spottis bla^,
And on her breist and Chutle pai^^^ull en^^
Betrand ane bunche of Thorni^ on his bak
Quhilk for his thist micht clim na nar the heuin.
Thus quhe^ they gadderit war their Gods seuin
Mercurins they cheisit with ane assent
To be foirspeikar in the Parliament.
Quha had been their, and liken for to heir
His facound tongue, and termis exquisite,
Of Rethorick the prettick he micht leir
In brief Sermon ane pregnant sentence write
Befoir Cupide veiling his Capalyte.
Speiris the cause of that vocatioun
And he anon schew his Intentioun.
Lo (quod Cupide) quha will blaspheme ye name
Of his awin God, outher in word in deid
To all Goddis he dois both lak and schame.
And should have vitter panis to his meid.
I say this by one wretchit Cresseid
The quhilk throw me, was sum time flour of lufe
Me and my Mother starklie can reprufe.
Saying of her grei^ Infelicitie
I was the cause, and my Mother Uenus,
Ane blind Gods, her called that micht not s^
With sclander and defame Injurious,
Thus her leuing unclean and Lecherous
Scho wald return on me and my Mother
To quhome I schew my grace abone all other.
And sen e ar all seuin deificait
Participant of deuyne sapience,
This greit Injury done to our hie estait
Me think with pane we should make recompense,
Was never to Gods done sic violence.
^s weill for ow, as for my self I say
Thairfoir ga help to revenge I ow pray.
Mercurius to Cupide gave answeir
And said Schir King my counsall is that e
Refer ow to the hiest Planeit heir,
And tak to him the lowest of degree
The pane of Cresseid for to modifie.
As God Saturn, with him tak Cynthia
I am content (quod he) to tak they two.
Than thus proceidit Saturn and the Moon
Quhen they the matter rypelie had degest,
For the dispyte to Cupide scho had done.
And to Uenus oppin and manifest.
In all her life with pane to be oppressed
And torment sair with seiknes Incurabill,
And to all lovers be abhominabill.
This duleful sentence Saturn tuik on hand
And passit down quhair cairfull Cresseid lay,
And on her heid he laid ane frostie wand.
Than lawfully on this wise can he say
Thy greit fairnes and all thy beauty gay
Thy wantoun blude, and eik thy goldin Hair
Heir I exclude fra the for euermair.
I change thy mirth into Melancholy,
Quhilk is the Mother of all pensiuenes,
Thy Moisture and thy heit in called and dry
Thine Insolence, thy play and wantones
To greit diseis, thy Pomp and thy riches
In mortal neid, and greit penuritie
Thou suffer sail, and as ane beggar die.
O cruel Saturn fraward and angry
Hard is thy dome, and to malicious
Ou fair Cresseid quhy hes thou na mercie^
Quhilk was sa sweit, gentill and amorous
Withdraw thy sentence and be gracious
As thou was never, sa schawis thou thy deid
Ane wraikfull sentence geuin on fair Cresseid.
Than Cynthia quhen Saturn past away
Out of her sait discendit down belyue,
And red ane bill on Cresseid quhair scholay,
Contening this sentence diffinityue
Fra heit of body I the now depryue
And to thy seiknes sall be na recure
Bot in dolor thy dayis to Endure.
Thy Cristall Eneminglit with blude I make
Thy voice sa cleir vnplesand hoir and hace,
Thy lusty lyre ouirspred with spottis blak,
And lumpis haw appeirand in thy face
Quhair thou cu^mis, Ilk man sall fle the place.
This sall thou go begging fra house to house
With Cop and Clapper like ane Laarous.
This doolie dream, this vglye visioun
Brocht to ane end Cresseid fra it awoik.
And all that Court and conuocatioun
Uanischit away, than raise scho up and fuik
Ane poleist glass, and her schaddow culd luik:
And quhen scho saw her face sa deformait
Gif scho in heart was wa aneuch God wait.
Weiping full sair, lo quhat it is [quod sche)
With fraward langage for to mufe and steir
Our craibit Goddis, and sa is seen on me?
My blaspheming now have I bocht full deir
All eirdlie Joy and mirth I set areir
Allace this day, allace this woeful tide,
Quhen I began with my Goddis for to Chyde.
Be this was said ane Child come fra the Hall
To warn Cresseid the Supper was reddy,
First knokkit at the dure and syne culd call.
Madame our Father biddis ow cum in hy
He hes merwell sa lang on groufely,
And sayis our prayers been to lang sum deill
The Goddis wait all our Intent full weill.
Quod scho fair Child ga to my Father deir
And pray him cum to speik with me anon.
And sa he did, and said douchter quhat cheir?
Allace (quod scho) Father my mirth is gone.
How sa (quod he) and scho can all expone
As I have tauld the vengeance and the wraik
For her trespass, Cupide on her culd tak.
He luikit on her vglye Lipper tace,
The quhylk before was quhite as Lilly flour
Wringand his handis of times he said allace
That he had leuit to se that woeful hour,
For he knew weill that their was na succou^
To her seiknes, and that dowblit his pane
Thus was their cair aneuch betuix them twane.
Quhen they togidder murnit had full lang,
Quod Cresseid Father, I wald not be kend.
Thairfoir in secreit wise e let me gang
Wnto one Hospital at the tounis end.
And thiddersum meit for Cheritie me send
To leif upon, for all mirth in this eird
Is fra me gane, sic is my wickit weird.
Than in ane Mantill and ane bawer Hat,
With Cop and Clapper wonder privily.
He opnit ane secreit et, and out their at
Conuoyit her, that na man should espy,
Wnto ane Uillage half ane mile thairby,
Delyuerit her in at the Spittaill house,
and daily sent her part of his Almou^.
Sum knew her weill, and sum had na kn^wled^^
Of her because scho was sa deformait.
With bylis blak ouirspred in her visag^,
And her fair color faidit and alterait.
Zit they presumit for her hi^ regrait,
And still murning, scho was of Nobill Ki^:
With better will thairfoir they tui^ her in.
The day passit, and Phoebus went to re^t,
The Cloudis blak ouirquhelmit all the sky.
God wait gif Cresseid was ane sorrowful Ge^^,
Seeing that uncouth fair and Harbery:
But meit or drink scho dressit her to ly
In ane dark Corner of the House allone.
And on this wise weiping, scho maid her moan.
THE COMPLAINT OF CRESSEID.
OSOP of sorrow, sonkin into cair:
O Catiue Creisseid, for now and ever mair,
Gane is thy Joy and all thy mirth in Eird,
Of all blyithnes now art thou blaiknit bair.
Their is na Salve may saif the of thy sair,
Fell is thy Fortoun, wickit is thy weird:
Thy blys is baneist, and thy baill on breird,
Under the Eirth, God gif I grauin were:
Quhair nane of Greece nor it of Troy micht heird.
Quhair is thy Chalmer wantounlie besene^
With burely bed and bankouris browderit been,
Spycis and Wine to thy Collatioun,
The Cowpis all of gold and siluerschene:
The sweit Meitis, seruit in plaittis clen^,
With Saipheron sals of ane good sessoun:
Thy ^ay ga^men^ is with money gudely Goun,
Thy plesand Lawn pinnit with goldin prene:
All is a^eir, thy greit Royal Renoun.
Quhair is thy garding with their greissis gay?
And fresche Flowris, quhilk the Queen Floray:
Had paintit plesandly in every pane,
Quhair thou was wont full merilye in May,
To walk and tak the dew be it was day
And heir the Merle and Mawis money ane,
With Ladyis fair in Carrolling to gane.
And se the Royal Rinkis in their array:
In garmentis gay garnischit on every grane
Thy greit triumphand fame and hie honor
Quhair thou was callit of Eirdlye wichtis Flour.
All is decayit, thy weird is welterit so.
Thy hie estait is turnit in darkness dour,
This Lipper Ludge tak for thy burelie Bour.
And for thy Bed tak now ane bunche of stro,
For waillit Wine, and Meitis thou had tho,
Tak mowlit Breid, Peirrie and Ceder sour:
Bot Cop and Clappper, now is all ago.
My cleir voice, and courtly carrolling,
Quhair I was wont with Ladyis for to sing.
Is rawk as Ruik, full hiddeous hoir and hace,
My plesand port all vtheris precelling:
Of lustines I was hald may ^onding.
Now is deformit the Figour of my face,
To luik on it, na Leid now lyking hes:
Sowpit in syte, I say with sair siching,
Ludgeit amang the Lipper Leid allace.
O Ladyis fair of Troy and Greece attend,
My misery, quhilk nane may comprehend.
My friuoll Fortoun, my Infelicitie:
My greit mischief quhilk na man can amend.
Be war in time approchis neir the end,
And in our mind ane mirror make of me:
As I am now, peradventure that e
For all our micht may cum to that same end,
Or ellis war, gif any war may be.
Nocht is our fairnes bot ane faiding Flour,
Nocht is our famous laud and hie honor.
Bot wind Inflat in other mennis eiris.
Zour roising reid to rotting sall retour:
Exempill make of me in our Memour,
Quhilk of sic thingis woeful witness beiris.
All Wealth in Eird, away as Wind it weiris.
Be war thairfoir, approchis neir the hour:
Fortoun is fikkill, quhen scho beginnis and steiris.
THVS chydand with her drerie destenye,
Welping, scho woik the nicht fra end to end.
Bot all in vane, her dule, her cairfull cry
Micht not remeid, nor it her murning mend.
Ane Lipper Lady raise and till her wend,
And said: quhy spurnis thou aganis the Wall,
To sla thy self, and mend nathing at all?
Sen thy weiping dowbillis bot thy woe.
I counsall the make vertew of ane neid.
To leir to clap thy Clapper to and fro,
And leir after the Law of Lipper Leid.
Their was na buit, bot forth with them scho eid,
Fra place to place quhill cauld and hounger sair:
Compellit her to be ane rank beggair.
That samin time of Troy the Garnisoun,
Quhilk had to Chiftane Worthy Troylus.
Throw Ieopardie of Weir had strikken down
Knichtis of Greece in number meruello^s,
With greit tryumphe and Laud victorious
Agane to Troy richt richt Royally they ra^^
The way quhai^ Cresseid with the Lipper baid.
Seeing that company yai come all with ane steuin
They gaif ane cry, and schuik coppis good speid.
Said worthy Lordis for goddis lufe of Heuin,
To us Lipper part of our Almous deid.
Than to their cry Nobill Troylus tuik heid,
Having piety, neir by the place can pas:
Quhair Cresseid sat, not witting quhat scho was.
Than upon him scho kest up both her Ene,
And with ane blenk it come into his thocht,
That he fumtime her face befoir had seen.
Bot scho was in sic plye he knew her nocht,
Zit than her luik into his mind it brocht
The sweit visage and amorous blenking
Of fair Cresseid sumtyme his awin darling.
Na wonder was, suppois in mind that he
Tuik her Figure sa sone, and lo now quhy.
The Idol of ane thing, in ca^e may be
Sa deip Imprentit in the fantasy:
That it deludis the wittis outwardly,
And sa appeiris in form and like estait,
Within the mind as it was figurait.
An^ spark of lufe than till his heart culd spring,
And kendlit all his body in ane Fire.
With hait Fewir ane sweit and trimbling
Him ^uik, quhill he was reddie to expyre.
To beir his Scheild, his Breist began to tire
Within ane quhyle he changit money hew,
And nevertheless no^ ane am other knew.
For knichtlie piety and memorial
Of fair Cresseid, ane Gyrdill can he tak.
Ane Purs of gold, and money gay Iowall,
Ane Purs of gold, and money gay Iowall.
And in the Skirt of Cresseid down ^an swale:
Than raid away, and not ane word spak.
Pensiwe in heart, quhill he come to the Town,
And for greit cair often syis almaist fell down.
The Lipper folk to Cresseid than can draw,
To se the equal distributioun
Of the Almous, bot quhen the gold they saw.
Ilk ane to other prewelie can roun,
And said one Lord hes mair affectioun
How ever it be, unto one Laarous,
Than to us all, we know be his Almous.
Quhat Lord is one (quod scho) have e na feill^
Hes done to us so greit humanity?
Zes (quod a Lipper man) I know him weill.
Schir Troylus it is, gentill and fre:
Quhen Cresseid understood that it was he,
Sciffer than steill, their stert ane bitter stound
Chrowout her heart, and fell down to the ground.
Quhen scho ouircome, with siching ^air and sad.
With money cairfull cry and called ochane.
Now is my breist with stormy stoundis stad,
Wrappit in woe, ane wretch full will of wane.
Than swounit scho often or scho culd refrane,
And ever in her swouning cryit scho thus^
O tals Cresseid and true Knicht Troylus.
Thy lufe, thy lawtie, and thy gentilne^,
I countit small in my prosperity.
Sa eleuait I was in wantones,
And clam upon the fickill quheill sa hie,
All Faith and Lufe I promissit to the.
Was in the self fickill and frivolous:
O falls Cresseid, and true Knicht Troilu^.
For lufe, of me thou keipt good continence.
Honest and chaist in conuersatioun.
Of all Women protector and defense
Thou was, and helpit their opinioun.
My mind in fleschelie foull affectioun
Was Inclynit to Lustis Lecherous:
Fie falls Cresseid, O true Knicht Troylus,
Lovers be war and tak good heid about
Quhome that e lufe, for quhome e suffer pain.
I lat ow wit, their is richt few thairout:
Quhome e may traist to have true lufe agane^
Preif quhen e will, our labor is in vain.
Thairfoir, I reid, e tak them as e find:
For they ar sad as Widdercok in Wind,
Because I know the greit vnstabilnes
Brukkill as glass, into my self I say.
Traisting in other als greit unfaithfulness:
Als unconstant, and als untrue of fay.
Thocht sum be true, I wait richt few ar they,
Quha findis treuth la^ him his Lady ruse:
Name but my self, as now I will a^cuse.
Quhe^ this was said, with Paper scho sat down,
And on this maneir maid her Testament.
Heir I beteiche my Corpse and Carioun
With Wormis and with Taidis to be rent.
My Cop and Clapper and mine Ornament,
And all my gold the Lipper folk ^all have:
Quhen I am deid, to bury me in grave.
This Royal Ring, set with this Rubie reid,
Quhilk Troylus in drowrie to me send.
To him agane I leif it quhen I am deid,
To make my cairfull deid wnto him kend:
Thus I conclude schortlie and make ane end,
My Spreit I leif to Diane quhair scho dwellis.
To walk with her in waist Woddis and Wellis,
O Diomeid thou hes both Broche and Belt,
Quhilk Troylus gave me in takning
Of his true lufe, and with that word scho swelt.
And sone ane Lipper man tuik of the Ring,
Syne buryit her withouttin tarying,
To Troylus furthwith the Ring he bair,
And of Cresseid the deith he ^an declair.
Quhen he had hard her greit infirmity,
Her Legacy and Lamentatioun.
And how scho endit in sic poverty,
He swelt for woe, and fell down in ane swoun,
For greit sorrow his heart to brist was boun:
Siching full sadly, said I can no moir,
Scho was untrue, and woe is me thairfoir.
Sum said he maid ane Tomb of Merbell gray.
And wrait her name and superscriptioun,
And laid it on her grave quhair that scho lay,
In goldin Letteris, containing this ressoun:
Lo fair Ladyis, Cresseid, of Troyis Town,
Sumtyme countit the flour of Womanheid.
Under this stane lait Lipper lyis deid.
Now worthy Women in this Ballet schort,
Maid for our worschip and Instructioun,
Of Cheritie, I monische and exhort,
Ming not our lufe with falls deceptioun.
Beir in our mind this schort conclusioun
Of fair Cresseid, as I have said befoir,
Sen scho is deid, I speik of her no moir.
FINIS.
