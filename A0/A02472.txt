LONDON: Printed for Thomas Archer, and are to be sold at his Shop in
Popes-head-Palace. 1613.

(...) Winter) and having past them, at last after he had traveled six
Months together, he arrived safely at Constantinople: Where, upon the first
day of May, 1612 he had audience given him by the great Emperor of the Turks,
to the great honor and reputation of the Netherland Provinces; and of the
States general of the same: The Solemnity whereof was in this manner
performed.

The Ambassador was conuayed unto the great Turks Court by Saphiler Aga, the
chief Commander of all the Turks Horsemen: and Siaus Bassa, principal of
all the Gentlemen in the Turks Court; accompanied with an hundred Siausers all
on Horseback, in such and the same manner, as they use to fetch and convey
the Ambassadors of the greatest Monarchs and Kings that are, unto his Court.
The Ambassador having increased his Train with some Netherlanders as then
resident in Constantinople, by reason that at the same time, there lay diverse
Netherland-ships before the town: and besides them, with some that were his
good friends, both inhabitants, and others of other Nations, whom he before had
known: whereby the honor of the Netherlands was preserved, to the great
contentment not only of the Turk himself, but also of all the Bassas of his
Court.

The old Captain Bassa, for a sign and token of great affection and honor,
caused the Ambassador to ride upon his own best Horse, which was most
sumptuously sadled and brideled, wherein the Turks, above all other Nations,
do specially show their pride and power. And so in great solemnity the
aforesaid Siausers, or the great Turks Gentlemen, richly clad and apparelled
in Cassockes of cloth of Gold, Velvet, and Satin, tode two and two before
him: after them followed their Servants, and some Ianitsers afoote, with two
Dragomans, or Interpreters, on horseback: after them followed the
Ambassador, accompanied on each side, by the aforesaid Saphiler Aga, and
Siaus Bassa, and his own followers, who as Gentlemen, (after the manner there)
do also kiss the great Turks hand, and in that manner rode with a great
applause and concourse of people to the Serralio, or Palace of the great Turk.

In this manner entering into the first gate of the Serralio, Siaus Bassa left
the Ambassador, and rode forward before him to certify the Bassas of his
coming. In this first Gate there stood about 60. Capitsers, or great Turks
Porters, with their Captain, for a watch. Then approaching to the second gate
of the Serralio, the Ambassador lighted from his horse, and was led in thereat
by the arm, by Peichijs Bassa, principal of the Pages, apparelled all in gold,
whose office is to conduct all Ambassadors unto the presence of the great
Turk: before this Gate there stood about 100. Capitsers, with 4. Captains for
a Guard, and within the gate, were about 300. Soubassas, which are Captains of
the Ianitsaries, each having a long white feather, like a Peacocks feather, on
their heads. There all the Bassas lighted off from their horses, and went on
foot to the Diuano (which is the Counsell-Chamber) wherein all the Bassas,
with the principal Vizier (representing the great Turks Person) four days
every week give open audience to all suitors, and determine all causes of the
whole Empire.

Having past through this Gate, on the one side of two long Galleries,
supported with Marble Pillars, there stood Ianitsarie Aga, the chief Commander
of all the Ianitsaries, and of all the footmen of Turkey, with 10000.
Ianitsaries: and on the other side, Saphiler Agas, the chief Commander of the
horsemen, with 2000. Saphers, or horsemen, who altogether bowing down their
heads after the Turkish manner, with great reverence, saluted the Ambassador,
he doing the like unto them. There met him the Kihaia, or Commander of all the
Capitsers, and Siaus Bassa, both of them being great Personages: they two led
him into the Diuano, going before him with two long staves or wands of silver
and gilt over, richly apparelled in cloth of Gold, which is the greatest
honor that can there be done to any man in the great Turks Court.

In the Diuano sat the Cahimachan, with all the Vesier Bassas, who are chief
and principal Counselors to the great Turk. Opposite over against the
Cahimachan, there was a stool set for the Ambassador. On his right side
(which by the Turks is held to be the unworthiest, as being under the sword of
another) sat Mahomet Bassa* Admiral of Turkey, betrothed to the great Turks
eldest Daughter, Dahut Bassa, married to the great Turks Aunt, Joseph Bassa,
Chelil Bassa, and Nischanzi Bassa, married to the great Turks Niece, whose
office is to set the great Turks name to all Letters Pattents, and public
Instruments that are granted and sent out by him. On the other side of
Cahimachan (a reasonable or indifferent space being left) sat the two
Cadileschers, or chief Judges of the whole Realm of Turkey, and on a seat
alone the great Treasoror, being a Vesier also. Over against him, in a chamber,
apart, there sat about 300. Secretaries or Clerks of the Tresory, each of
them being Auditors of a several Province, and under them their Clerks.

The Ambassador having for a while spoken and conferred with the Bassas, there
was four round silver tables brought in whereof one was set between the
Ambassador and the Cahimachan the second before the other Bassas: the third
before the Cadileschers and the Treasoror, and the fourth before the Nischanzi
Bassa and his company: and there they were feasted in sumptuous manner, with
many sorts of meat, served in great porceline dishes, setting but one dish
down at once after the Dutch manner. The Ambassador eating with the
Cahimachan, Captain Bassa, and Dahut Bassa. In the middle of dinner, each of
the Bassas, and the Ambassador drank Sorbetta, in dishes of gold, which is a
kind of drink made of Water, Sugar, and juice of Lemonds, mixed with Amber
and Musk: whereof they drank but once, and no more: for the Turks are very
sober drinkers, and the great Lords use to drink no wine. The Mutpac Emini, or
the great Turks chief Cook, having under him above 2000. Cooks and officers
in the Kitchen, stood to serve at the table, and below him stood about 100.
Teschnegers, or waiters, all with Cassockes of cloth of gold, setting the
meat upon the tables, and serving at them. Of them the Beies, that is the
Governors of towns, and Barons are made.

The Cahimachan gave the Ambassador the first cut of every dish of meat,
mean time the Gentlemen (...) many precious Stones, all the Chamber being
hanged about with most costly Hangings, embrodered and imbossed with Gold, the
ground being Crimsen Velvet: the top thereof framed like a round tabernacle,
all covered over with Gold, with diverse kinds of works therein: this Chamber
(being not very great) (when it is decked and hanged richly for to give
audience to any Ambassador) is esteemed and valued to be worth ten hundred
thousand Hungarian Ducats, in English money, at seven shillings a Ducket,
350000 pounds.

When the Ambassador came before the great Turk, one of the Capitser Bassas
took up the skirt of the Turks Gown, which the Ambassador stooping down,
kissed: and then having done the accustomed reverence unto his Majesty, two of
the Capitser Bassas led him backward to the side of the Chamber, where in the
side of the wall there is a ^ea^e furnished with rich Hangings and Cushins, but
it is not the manner that any Ambassador does sit down in the Turks
presence. The two Capitser Bassas stood still by the Ambassador, then the
Dragoman was led before the great Turk, and brought backward again by the
Ambassador, and after them the twelve Gentlemen orderly one after another:
that done, the first Vizier or Cahimachan, read a Petition before the great
Turk, thereby briefly beseeching his Majesty, graciously to vouchsafe
audience unto the Ambassador.

After that, the Ambassador made an Oration in Latin, which by the Dragoman
was presently interpreted in Turkish speech: and to when the Ambassador had
delivered his Letters of credit, together with the propositions aforesaid in
writing in a Bag of cloth of gold, according to their accustomed manner, by
his Interpreter, to the Cahimachan, he was led out of the Chamber again, doing
the accustomed honor and reverence unto the great Turk, going backewards as
aforesaid, without any answer ^^^m he Turk himself, or any of his Bassas, it
(...) not their manner nor custom to do it: and t^^^ went out with a great
number of Courtiers and Officers, until he came out of the gate aforesaid, on
both sides saluting Ianitser Aga, and Saphiler Aga, being by them, and the
Ianitsaries and Saphilers likewise saluted as before. It is to be wondered at,
that in the Turks Court, when they sit in Counsel which is ordinarily four
days in a week, there assembleth at the least 30000. men, all in pay and
wages under the great Turk, besides the Bassas, who stand there so quietly,
and with so great silence, that in a manner they show to be so many Images,
without life or soul.

The Ambassador with his train, being on horseback again, they were led a
little aside (as the manner in that Country is) to see the Court and train of
the great Turk pass along before them, partly to honor the Ambassadors, and
partly to show the great Turks Power. And first, all the Ianitsaries about
10000. in number, with a great noise came out of the gate, and marched before
him, well apparelled, but without weapons. Then followed 500 Solachijs, or
Bulucbassis, which are Corporals and other Officers of the Ianitsaries: then
about 500 Soubassis, with long white feathers upon their heads, which are
Captains among others. Then on Horseback followed Stampol Aga, being the
chief of all the Samoglanes, which are certain young men and Children, which
are given to the great Turk tribute: then the Perchimalgis, Ianigseris,
Iagischijs, the Clarke of the Ianitsaries: Solach Bassas, Commander of the
Solachijs: Tagerschij Bassa, chief Hunter to the great Turk: the Chahagraby,
or Lieutenant to Ianitser Aga, and his Substitute. Then on foot followed 200.
Soubassis, and then Ianitser Aga himself, Commander over all the Ianitsaries:
after him followed 100. Menegesians, all with Girdles of Silver about one of
their hands, which also are Ianitsaries, and each of them carry a Torch before
the Aga, when he goes the round by night through Constantinople, as all the
great Visiers and Bassas night by night are bound in person to go the round,
to prevent an such as seek to do any hurt or mischief, each of them having
an Executioner with them, to punish all those that they find doing any hurt or
wickedness, or that are in the streets, according to the desert and merit of
their offenses, either by present death or otherwise. All the great Turks
Court having in this manner passed along before the Ambassador; he was again
conducted unto his Lodging as aforesaid, and for a further honor, there was by
the Bassas sent unto him, two Peichijs, or Pages, belonging to the great Turk,
wearing silver and gilt Hats whereof there are always a great many going about
the great Turks Horse, who although they are not accustomed to wait upon any
other man, no not upon the great Vizier Bassa, yet they followed the
Ambassador, on either side of him as he was on horseback, till he came to
his Lodging. For this Amity and Friendship made between the great Turk and
the united Netherlands, all the Turks in general much rejoiced, so that as
then it seemed to be a day of triumph, and from that time forward when the said
League was first begun to be made, they began to treat about the releasing
of the Netherlands out of captivity, as also touching negotiation and
traffic, to the which and, now already commandment is sent by the great
Turk into Barbary, and other places, to declare the Peace made between the
Netherlands and the said great Turk, and to command them, that from thence
forth the Netherlands shall by them be holden and esteemed to be his Friends.
This Treaty with the great Turk (for the which the Lord be praised) concluded
and agreed upon, with the greatest honor and reputation of the Netherlands
that may be devised, being made and signed with the great Turks own hand, and
with his Oath thereunto annexed, was delivered unto the Ambassador, upon the
sixteenth day of July last past, being by him before for the space of six
days perused, read, and in all defective places corrected and amended, in the
presence of certain men that understood the Turkish Language, and were
requested thereunto by the said Ambassador.

By which means the Netherlanders have obtained the best and surest
Privileges in Turkey, that ever heretofore have to any Nation been granted:
for whatsoever the Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Venitians in general, or any
of them in particular, by the Turks special favor and grace, have obtained
of him, it is all specially set down in their recapitulation, (...) amity and
friendship, were presented unto Us. The contents and substance whereof were,
that understanding the Maiesticalnesse of Our Royal and Princely State, you
were moved and incited to seek for Our entire Friendship and good will: and to
show your great desires thereunto, have endeavored your selves to the same end
to write unto Us, and to make an Accord and Friendship with Us, which might
always be holden and observed, declaring that your wills and desires have
always been good and great in that respect, to seek and crave Friendship at
Our Imperial hands; and to show and declare your good affections unto Us in
like sort, and in the same manner as other Kings have done, which with Us have
entered into League and Friendship; desiring to be holden and accounted among
the numher of those Kings that are Our Friends: and that We would grant unto
you Our Letters of agreement and consent therein, in such manner as We have
given the same to other Kings of Christendom. Which that it may be done with
sincerity and truth, together with other things which you further desire and
require at Our hands; (whereof the Contents being imparted unto Our Royal
Council, and having fully and wholly understood your wills and meanings) We of
our Imperial Grace and Favor have abundantly granted and given unto you by
Our Letters Pattents, not only the same Privileges and Liberties which We
have in times past imparted to the Kings aforesaid, according to your own
desires, but over and besides the same, much more then you either have sought
or desired by your Letters of Us, which with Our own hands, We have by Our
Letters Pattens confirmed, and given commandment from Our Majesty, that in
all places and Countries of Our Empire, wherein any of your Countrymen and
Subjects shall be known and found to be Slaves they shall be freely set at
liberty, according to the Contents of Our said Letters Pattents of Amity,
Peace, and Friendship. Further We give you to understand, that your aforesaid
Ambassador has with great honor and modesty, as also with great care and
diligence, performed and done his duty and service in his said Embassage
whereof he was sent by you, in all things having obtained the benefit of Our
Friendship; and in good manner and fashion has performed the same: and when he
came before Us, was permitted by word of mouth to speak and pronounce the
Message and Commission by you given unto him, to be delivered unto Us, which
We having understood, as also well liked, allowed, and accepted of, together
with the Presents by you sent, and delivered by him unto Us, (and which We will
keep in Our own presence and continual sight) having received the same, as
also the said Ambassador, with great Love and Friendship. The ancient custom
of Our Majesty is, that all Our gates of grace, favor, and good will, shall
stand continually open for all, and unto all men, and at all times; but
especially to those that come unto Us with so great a desire of faithful
Friendship, to whom it is requisite to show and impart all honor and good will
that possible may be. Therefore We say, that you having received these Our
Letters, from thence-forth (as it is requisite) We look and desire that you
shall hold and observe the Treaty and Friendship made by you with Us,
perpetually; according to your own Letters and Offers sent unto Us, and in the
like manner and form, as the Kings of England and France Our Friends, long
time unto this day have held and maintained the like Friendship and Amity.
Which We hope you will do in all points according to your Promises, and that
our Friendship may continue and hold firm and stable, Our desire is that you
should from time to time eertifie us, by Letters, of your estates and healths,
and We for Our part, will not fail to fulfill and accomplish all whatsoever
shall tend unto your good and welfare, with all favor and grace, as near as
We can: and promise you further, that our good will and friendship shall not
cease continually to increase toward you, for your good, and from good to
better; whereof We would not have you to doubt.

Imperial City of Constantinople; which GOD preserve from all hurt and
misfortune.

Christendom) in the beginning of the Month of July, 1612.

of the Law of the Messiah, Governors of the state of the people of
Christendom, Patrons of courtesy, and of the Honor and Power of Princes; The
Lords and States general of the united Provinces of the Netherlands, and of
all other places subject unto them a good end, and the Grace and Favor of GOD.

ACcording to the Friendship which is convenient to be showed unto Lords of
your degree, and the accustomed favor and amity, of the great and mighty
Emperor of Turkey, which at this time is given and granted unto your Honors;
In sign of love, and assurance of Friendship, I give you to understand by the
grace and help of God almighty (whom I beseech to preserve and defend the
King, and by the favor and power of our holy Prophet, who is in glory, and
rests in peace with God, protect and save the King of all Lands and Seas;
Dominator from the East unto the West; Commander over Mecha and Jerusalem; the
most Noble Prince of the whole Commonwealth of the Inhabiter of the World with
grace and favor; the most righteous King, whom GOD long prosper and preserve
upon earth, his Kingdom and Greatness with Honor, who therein is an vpholder
in poverty and misery of all creatures, the refuge of all poor oppressed
people, an aduancer of the Banner of the holy Law; King of Arabia and Asia;
Dominator over the most mightiest Monarchy in the World; Vpholder by the power
of God, wherein he is King, of all Kings; and who has his trust and confidence
in the favor and promise of the true and only GOD; the great and most
puissant Emperor, our gracious and mighty King, Sultan Achomat Ch^m;
Protecter of the Alcoran, whom GOD Almighty preserve and maintain in all
power and Imperial Majesty, and suffer him to command over the whole world
for his welfare and good, etc.) that there was brought unto his Imperial
Palace, (which is the upholding and preservation of Honor, and the light of
the world, shining above all the Powers and Majesty's of Kings) a Letter,
signifying your great and kind Friendship and good ^^is, by your Ambassador,
CORNELIUS HAHA, one of the chief Commanders amongst you, in the Law of
Christendom, and of Noble blood (whose Honor God long preserve) who being
arrived in this Imperial Palace, has declared and fully signified your
Honors great good wills and meanings, as also the entire affections, which your
said Honors bear unto his Majesty. Which done, your said Ambassador took
his rest for certain days, after his long, weary, and troublesome journey, as
being not well at ease, and after certain days of rest, communicated his
intent unto me, thereby to give me to understand the effect and meaning of
your affairs, according to your Commission: to whom, in the behalf of our
great Emperor, we showed that favor, respect and honor which he well
merited and deserved; and therewithal took a true Copy of your Honors
Letters, and having imparted the same unto the Lords, Visiers of this Council,
such as deal in matters of State, as also unto those that are wise and learned
in the holy Law; and having conferred, and considered about the Contents, and
of the hearty and good affection by you therein showed unto his Imperial
Majesty, being the mirror and clear light of the world (whose Noble Person,
and puisant Dominions God preserve and keep from all troubles and adversities
which daily happen throughout the world) And finding your request to be good
and very reasonable, as soon as we were informed of your meanings and
desires, we delayed no time to impart the same unto his Imperial Majesty,
who liking well, and allowing thereof, gave commandment that all due and
respective order should speedily be taken about the same, and that it should be
brought to good effect, with all diligence and care; and therewithal order was
presently taken ex motu proprio from the Emperor mouth and by his own
consent, that your Ambassador should come unto his Princely Palace and
Presence, to salute his Majesty, and thereupon your Honors said Ambassador,
accompanied and attended upon in such order as was fitting and convenient for
his Honor, having humbly saluted his Majesty, and being apparelled, both
himself and his Train, with honorable Suits, according to the manner and
custom of this Country; and that Honor and due respect showed unto him, which
to his place and person was requisite to be done: his Imperial Majesty gave
license and free permission unto him, to have access unto his Court, for the
execution of his Embassage, as other Ambassadors and Governors of the Empire
use to do, as also to consult with the Lords Visiers, the Protectors of the
Law, and specially the chief Judge of Turkey, which is a Lord of the holy
Mufti Effendi, together with the Lords Cadi Esquieri (so the great men of the
Land are named) and withal other his Governors about the same, and with his
Majesty's advice and consent, your motion of Amity and Friendship sought and
propounded unto him, being well considered and advised of by them, and they
having fully and wholly declared the same unto the great Monarch of the World,
and the most mighty and vprightest King thereof (whom God preserve) by the
help and assistance of God: his Majesty freely and thankefully accepted of
your good wills and Friendships, and has placed the same among the number of
those that are united unto him in perfect Amity and Friendship: and has
determined and ordained that the same shall for ever be respected and
maintained by him. And therewithal his Imperial Majesty has commanded that
we should set down and record the Articles of agreement and unite on both
parts, according to your desires, and also to make and send you a Letter in his
own Name.

And I also for my part, as your good friend, have written this Letter; which,
with his Majesty's, we send unto your Honors, wishing that by Gods grace, and
in an happy and prosperous hour, the perfect Amity and Friendship knit
between us, may in like sort long continue, which with all my heart I desire:
for it is most sure and certain that the supreme Lord of the noble house of
Ottomans, and the Imperator of all other Rulers and Lords in the World, our
most Puisant Lord and King, is so truly united in fast and firm Friendship
with your Honors, that from henceforth all the Favors and Honors that may
proceed and be imparted from his Imperial hands, unto his Friends and
Well-willers, shall be given and showed unto you, as by the Capitulation and
agreement set down and recorded he has fully manifested and recorded, in such
manner that all promises, and conditions, made and specified to be granted
unto on his behalf, within his Kingdoms and Dominions, shall be truly and
faithfully observed, fulfilled and kept. And my self your good friend, in like
manner, will not fail to show you all the honor and respect that may be, and
will by no means endure that the least hurt or wrong whatsoever, shall be done
unto your Honors, (in your Subjects or Vassals) within these our Countries,
for that the Word and Promise of our most righteous and honorable King, (whom
God preserve) is for ever firm and stable, and most powerful, in regard that
his Majesty's mind has been, and is always addicted unto peace and
quietness, and specially desires that his people should live in unity and
peace, that under the shadow of his Imperial Majesty, they may so live
happily and at hearts ease. And seeing that the Lord of all the world has
granted you so great favor and happy fortune to be united and joined in
friendship, love, and amity with so puisant great and magnanimious a King,
replenished with benignity, grace, mercy, and compassion, as our Emperor is:
It is most certain, and you may assure your selves thereof, that his
Commandments and promises are firm and most sure, and that there shall be no
contrariety found therein, and assure your selves for certain, that it shall
not fail in any manner in regard that his (...) be a means to procure the
welfare of all Gods creatures, to their everlasting benefit and good. We for a
conclusion say, that if on our side, all the Articles of agreement and Amity,
set down and specified in the Treaty concerning us, and also all that which
on your sides is promised, concerning the peace, in your Letters, be well
performed, maintained, and kept, according to the inward and affectionate
friendship showed and proffered by you with heart and good will; that so in
time to come, all our affairs may the longer and the better have good and
happy success, we hope and trust in GOD that in all the parts of the World,
where Kings and Princes reign, and shall hear and understand of the
Friendship and Peace made between us, those that are our Friends will rejoice
thereat, and such as with-stand the same shall feel the smart thereof. God
bring this our proceeding to good end, and for your good and prosperity.

Concerning your Ambassador aforesaid, whom we must commend, we say, that
not only touching his Embassage, but also in all the rest of the things
belonging to matter of Estate, both in general and particular, he has done
and performed the same with as much care and diligence as in him possible was,
sparing no labor, travail, nor care, neither in place nor matter, nor in any
of his proceedings omitted any thing whatsoever, which he knew, or by any
means perceived, to be needful or necessary to be propounded or moved, to
bring these affairs to a good end. And specially coming into the presence of
our most Puisant Emperor, (whom God preserve) he appeared there before him,
with such honorable behavior, grace, and courtesy, that it pleased his
Majesty exceeding well, and moved him thereby to take great pleasure and
contentment in him: and in all his actions has so behaved himself, that more
could not have been done, not required at his hands concerning his charge. And
to conclude, such a personage as he (in the Superlatiue degree,) is fit to be
an Ambassador: in such sort, that all the Lord Visiers, my fellows, and the
rest of the Lords of the Emperors Court wondered thereat, and said that such a
man that should deal in public affairs, ought to be such a one, as he showed
himself unto us to be: being altogether in great admiration to see his manner
of proceedings in all his affairs, and for that cause, being so well pleased
and contented with his behavior, were well content that he should have daily
access unto his Majesty's Court. Your Honors shall do well to esteem much
of him, for that a man of his deserts and qualities meriteth to be preferred.

Thus having at this time, no more to say (having made a true relation of all
that has here been done and past) but only to wish health and long
prosperity unto your Honors: we leave to trouble you.

Written in the beginning of the Month Giamati Elebla, in the year 1021. in
the City of Constantinople; which GOD preserve.
The Copy of a Letter, written by the Lord Mufti Effendi, chief Judge of the
Turkish Empire: unto the general States of the united Provinces of the
NETHERLANDS.
PVisant Lords of the Christian Law, and the honor of the Nations under the
MESSIAH; my Lords, the general states of the united Netherland-Prouinces, and
most Noble Lord Prince MAVRICE: May it please you to understand, that this
year was sent unto the Imperial Palace of the most Puisant King, highly
magnified and exalted; the Executioner of the Commandments given to the World
in the Temples; the furtherer of Justice, and the Vpholder or Restorer of
Towns and Cities, the greatest and mightiest King and Monarch of the World
(whose honor I beseech God always to continue, and that his Kingdom may
flowrish until the day of doom) your Honors Letters and Ambassador, to
treat of Amity and Peace, with great reverence and respect unto the high
Court of his Majesty's Dominions; wherein your Honors have done a thing worthy
commendations, and exceeding well accepted of, for that all those that desire
to make Friendship, and to have Peace with the King of the Noble House of
OTTOMAN (whom God increase in Honor, Power, and Majesty unto the Worlds end)
until this day have not by any means endured any loss or hinderance
whatsoever, but have thereby attained to great profit and advantage, which is
manifestly known unto all the World, and among all Nations, and all those unto
whom, or with whom, the most Puisant King (whom God preserve) does make peace
and contracteth Amity, or that for their parts do endeavor themselves to
observe and hold peace and Friendship with him, have well experienced and tried
his great Favors, to whom his Majesty has continually doubled, and showed
his special grace and benignity, which is a certain sign and token, that in
time to come, your Friendship proffered and obtained, shall more and more
increase, and be so well ratified and established, that nothing whatsoever
shall be cause to break or infringe the same. For that the great Turk will
show your Honors such friendship, that in his Empire of Turkey neither you, nor
any of your Ships, shall need to fear any hurt or harm to be done unto you
in any thing whatsoever. To conclude, we all together will continue your
perfect friends, and be friends to your friends, and foes to your foes: and the
further that you proceed therein, so much the more shall the benefit of his
Majesty's favors be seen, and your advantage procured thereby, and in this
matter which by you has been sought, all favor and Friendship afford unto
you, although that in this point it is not unknown unto you, how many
adversaries you have had, who by all means and ways possible, have sought to
hinder your proceedings herein, and to divert it, that it might take no effect.

Therefore as I have said, seeing that your enemies have wrought thus secretly
against you, it is great reason, that this League and Contract should be surely
made, and according to your Letters, the Articles have been set down,
certifying you, that all shall be done as you desire: and with all we think
that it was great reason that this peace should be established, and therefore
our most puisant Emperor has been content graciously to accept of your
Friendship, and according to your Letters, the aforesaid Privileges have
been granted unto us: and that in all things whatsoever past concerning them,
there has nothing been omitted that was requisite to be put in according to
your desires. And for your Ambassador Cornelius Haga, whom your Honors sent
hither, he has performed his charge in that respect (in the Superlatiue
degree:) and with great grace and honor gone through therewith, and has
executed the same with as much diligence as possible he might. Wherefore I must
needs say, that such a man as he is, deserves as well to be made an
Ambassador, as any one whatsoever of his degree, being of that Judgment that
he is: the reason is, for that whatsoever he has done concerning this
business of yours, he has done it effectually, and therefore it is
requisite, that you take care, that no scandal may hereafter be procured
thereby unto you, and before all things to do your endeavors that this Peace
may continue firm and stable, for that it is every way profitable and good for
your Honors, and your towns. And upon condition that your Honors shall keep
and firmly hold this Treaty, we also will endeavor our selves to maintain
and uphold the same for ever: for our great and most Puisant Emperor (whom God
preserve) is a courteous Prince, and exceeding gracious, and shows all the
grace and favor that he can unto his friends, being an Emperor of great
Honor and Majesty, whose custom is always to do well.

The Conclusion therefore of our Letter is, that whatsoever has been
concluded touching this peace, you will take care to perform it to your
powers. Moses Ierusalmi a Jew, has been a great furtherer of your affairs,
as much as in him lay, and has made me acquainted with all your proceedings.

Peace be with you all.

By him that executes the Commandments that are sent forth to be done for the
honor and authority of the Puisant and most Princely house of Ottomans,
Mehemet the Son of G. Saalteldin. God have mercy upon us all.

FINIS.
